This affirmative argues the United States and NATO should build and
secure a fiber optic cable in the Arctic with quantum sensing
technology. The first advantage says that other cable routes are longer
and face disruption risks and don't utilize proper security measures.
The second advantage says the US and NATO should collaborate to set
quantum standards and that quantum sensing is the most mature and
near-term application of quantum technology. The quantum standards
advantage does not have a strong Arctic key warrant. A core weakness is
that there is only one good proposal that says cables, quantum, and
Arctic (Ondrášková) -- lots of evidence has two of the three but not
all.

Benefits and opportunities of **[Arctic]{.underline}** Connectivity

Despite differences in the proposed [routes]{.underline}, the envisioned
[benefits are shared by all trans-Arctic submarine **fiber-optic cable
projects**. [The Arctic]{.mark} is]{.underline} seen as [a **shortcut**
that [enables shorter]{.mark} cable [connections and **reduces**]{.mark}
**network [latency]{.mark} significantly** when compared to the
**existing routes**]{.underline}. Similarly, [Arctic [cables]{.mark}
would [increase]{.mark} the [**diversity** and **robustness** of the
global]{.mark} submarine cable [network]{.mark} **suffering** from
**over-concentration**]{.underline}. In this context, [the significance
of [the first **successful**]{.mark} trans-[Arctic cable]{.mark} must be
emphasized]{.underline}. While a single cable system alone may not
provide enough capacity to cause a major shift in intercontinental data
flows, [it [can]{.mark} validate the]{.underline} long-discussed [Arctic
cable concept and [**pave the way** for subsequent
projects]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The economic benefits related to the trans-Arctic cables can be
approached at least from four different perspectives. First, the
companies in charge of the design and development of different projects
are typically profit-seeking. The companies involved in the production
and installation of submarine cables also follow regular business logic
and sell their products and services at the price that secures
reasonable profit margins. Second, the successful implementation of
trans-Arctic submarine cable project(s) should provide long-term
economic benefits to companies and organizations that invest in them.
However, the investors involved will surely be aware of the relatively
long payback time of the infrastructure and understand submarine cables
as relatively low margin and low risk long-term investments. Third, the
[capacity buyers/users of the cable(s) seek]{.underline} direct or
indirect **[economic benefits]{.underline}**, which may be [related to
the costs of **transmitting data**, the **competitive advantages**
gained through **faster connections**, or the **risk reduction**
achieved by utilizing **diverse** cable routes]{.underline}.

Attention should also be paid to the positive economic impact on
national and regional economies. According to the 2022 study by
Copenhagen Economics, the trans-Arctic cables and Nordic-centered
digital infrastructure is not only an attractive option for the EU, but
also offers an additional source of growth for the Nordic region itself.
The study argues that the [location of **submarine cables** and **data
centers** leads to substantial **spillover effects** to the regions in
which they are placed]{.underline} and estimates that an Arctic cable to
Japan could boost GDP in the Nordic region by more than EUR 1 billion
annually if fully utilized (NORDUnet 2022). However, the second report
published at the beginning of 2024 raised concern that the wider
societal and economic benefits of the trans-Arctic submarine cables are
often not fully factored into investment decisions. Therefore, neither
the positive impacts on regional economy nor to European digital
resiliency and autonomy receive the attention they deserve (Copenhagen
Economics 2024). Although no comprehensive estimation and calculations
concerning the possible economic impacts on regional economy have been
made, similar kinds of favorable outcomes are also expected in Hokkaido,
for example.

Arctic cables, geopolitics and security

Submarine fiber-optic cables' role as critical infrastructure is
nowadays well understood. Therefore, the linkage between geopolitics and
submarine cables as well as the importance of this infrastructure in
securing EU's strategic digital autonomy is often emphasized. Besides
recognizing the possibilities, [alarmed voices has also been heard in
connection to **China's digital Arctic Silk Road**
initiative]{.underline}, for example (Delaunay & Laundriault 2020). The
trans-Arctic submarine fiber-optic cables and other attempts to improve
connectivity in the Arctic are highly relevant from the perspective of
human security of the people living in the Arctic. Yet, discussion
concerning possibilities related to elearning, e-healthcare, and other
aspects of human security make sense only if the local communities and
telecommunications companies, who are the build the infrastructure
around the planned landing stations in the Arctic, are included.

[Traditional [security concerns]{.mark} have]{.underline} always [played
a role in the development of submarine cable infrastructure,
and]{.underline} they have been [[consider]{.mark}ed]{.underline} also
[in]{.underline} the [context of Arctic projects]{.underline}. While the
[Arctic cable initiatives by the **Russian military** that
appeared]{.underline} in international media in the springs of 2018 and
2019 (Saunavaara 2022), [are **extreme examples**]{.underline} of this
kind of connection, the security dimensions of the Arctic cables have
also been identified and analyzed in Europe and the US. A report
focusing on the Arctic Connect project and cybersecurity was published
in 2019. The report concluded that submarine [cables]{.underline}
systems [are]{.underline} very [interesting]{.underline} destination
[for [**hackers**, **cyber attackers**, **terrorist** and **state
actors**; tapping]{.mark} fiber-optic [cables]{.mark} to **eavesdrop**
the information is a **conscious threat**; [and **sabotage**]{.mark}
would be simpler]{.underline} to perform [than tapping, but]{.underline}
the [networks high degree of [**redundancy** would **limit**]{.mark}
**the [effects]{.mark} that attack** against one cable
system]{.underline} would have (Lehto et al. 2019).

In the US, Team Telecom designated the Quintillion network as a critical
infrastructure for national security already before the company
underwent a major re-organization following the fraud case. As a part of
this process, many key people with background in the US military and
national security were recruited to the company's new leadership team.
When [Quintillion and ATLAS]{.underline} Space Operations
[completed]{.underline} the [construction of the satellite **ground
station** in February 2021]{.underline}, it was described as [a
significant step forward]{.underline} in the quest [to close a
**critical gap** in US **security capabilities** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. In their homepage (as of 17 November 2024), the
company describes the Arctic as the site of a powerful trifecta between
three world superpowers, Russia and China's increasing investments in
the region as a strategic threat, broadband as the foundational
infrastructure upon which any successful Arctic strategy must be built
on, and Quintillion as an actor contributing to the American homeland
security.

The recent recognition of submarine fiber-optic cables as critical
infrastructure originates from various sources. The submarine [[cable
conflicts]{.mark} and tensions between the US and China]{.underline},
which [[heated up]{.mark} in the mid-2010s]{.underline}, impact all
international cable industry-related developments. [[Given]{.mark}
China's strict control over,]{.underline} and the
[government's]{.underline} close [ties with telecommunications
companies, the US has growing concerns]{.underline} (shared by many
other countries) [about Chinese companies' involvement in **building**,
**owning**, or **controlling** subsea cable systems. The [fears]{.mark}
that [China could **spy on**]{.mark} **global internet
[traffic]{.mark}** or **intercept sensitive data** has led to
restrictions]{.underline} on certain [Chinese companies]{.underline},
like Huawei. The US government has also blocked submarine fiber-optic
cable projects (such as the Pacific Light Cable Network) involving
Chinese state-owned companies and exerted influence over projects to
ensure that Chinese companies do not gain control over international
communication routes (Gross et al. 2023).

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} role of Yemen's [[Houthi]{.mark}
rebels]{.underline} in the submarine [cable [cuts in]{.mark} the Red
Sea, [one of the **choke points**]{.mark} in **data traffic** between
Europe and Asia, has [received]{.mark} **significant
[attention]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the spring of 2024. [[While
these problems have been]{.mark} used as [an argument on behalf
of]{.mark} the trans-[Arctic cables]{.mark}, which would **increase
network diversity**, [the northern waters]{.mark} have]{.underline} also
[[witnessed **several incidents**]{.mark} where **[intentional
damaging]{.mark}** has been **proven** or **speculated**.
The]{.underline} Russian [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} in February
2022 [and]{.underline} the [explosion of]{.underline} the [[Nord
Stream]{.mark} gas pipelines alarmed]{.underline} political decision
makers and the public [about]{.underline} the importance and
[vulnerability of subsea infrastructures]{.underline}. Succeeding the
Nord Stream case, [new attention was paid to Russian vessels'
**suspicious activities** near]{.underline} submarine fiber-optic
[[cables]{.mark} and the incidents that]{.underline} had [occurred
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} northern **[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
April 2021 and January 2022. [[The Baltic Connector]{.mark}
incident]{.underline}, which occurred [in]{.underline} October [2023,
raised further questions concerning]{.underline} the security of
submarine infrastructure and [intentionality behind]{.underline} the
accident caused by [[a]{.mark} container [ship **dragging**]{.mark}
**its [anchor]{.mark}** and damaging **data cable** [between **Sweden**
and **Estonia**]{.mark}]{.underline} and a gas pipeline between Finland
and Estonia.

[Another]{.underline} incident [happened]{.underline} on 17-18 [November
2024 when]{.underline} submarine [[cables connecting Finland]{.mark}
with]{.underline} northern [[Germany and Sweden with Lithuania]{.mark}
[were]{.mark} **suddenly [disrupted]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While these
cables intersect, the damages were at separate points. As [natural
explanations were ruled out, **external force** originating
[from]{.mark} **human activity** was quickly recognized as the cause of
the cable break]{.underline}. International [investigators identified [a
Chinese]{.mark}-registered [vessel]{.mark}]{.underline} named Yi Peng 3,
traveling from Russia to Egypt, as the main suspect. The cable has been
repaired, but authorities around Europe are assessing potential
responses to increased hybrid acts of warfare (Moss 2024; Cinia 2024).
[The **[most recent]{.mark}** disruption to **submarine cables** [in the
Baltic]{.mark} Sea [happened]{.mark} on]{.underline} 26 [December
2024]{.underline}. This time the Finnish authorities boarded the Eagle S
oil tanker in Finnish waters and seized the vessel that damaged the
FinnishEstonian power line and four submarine telecommunications cables
[[by]{.mark} dragging its anchor across the seabed. The
tanker]{.underline} that was sailing from St. Petersburg to Egypt and
[belongs to [Russia's "**shadow fleet**,"]{.mark}]{.underline} is
[registered in the Cook Islands and owned by **U**]{.underline}nited
**[A]{.underline}**rab **[E]{.underline}**mirates-based company (Reuters
2025).

**Cables are vital to [military]{.underline} and [civilian]{.underline}
data but threatened by [hybrid war]{.underline}, [tapping]{.underline},
and [accidents]{.underline}. Quantum sensors deter via
[denial]{.underline} and [detection]{.underline}.**

[Undersea **cables** are having a moment]{.underline}. In November,
[**breaks** in two **[data cables]{.mark}** in the Baltic Sea garnered
media attention]{.underline} far beyond what problems with undersea
critical infrastructure normally generate. [These]{.underline} apparent
[acts of **[sabotage]{.mark}** came after similar **damage**
to]{.underline} subsea cables in the Baltic Sea a year earlier and
damage to [three undersea cables in the **Red Sea** in February
2024]{.underline}. On the other side of the globe, Taiwan's Coast Guard
have been investigating whether a ship owned by a Hong Kong company cut
one of the small number of fiberoptic cables connecting the island
nation to the outside world.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[has **vital
stakes**]{.underline}]{.mark} here: [Four]{.underline} U.S. [firms
account for a growing share of]{.underline} the ownership in [undersea
data cables]{.underline} and the traffic they carry. [These
firms]{.underline}---including [**Meta** and
**Google**]{.underline}---[are the crown jewels [in]{.mark} the U.S.
**[tech]{.mark}nology sector**. The]{.underline} American **[financial
sector]{.underline}**, another vital source of American prosperity, [is
**heavily reliant** on undersea cables. [Every day]{.mark}]{.underline},
financial [transactions]{.underline} worth [more than [\$10 trillion
travel]{.mark} along [the seabed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} U.S. **[military]{.mark}**]{.underline} also
[[relies]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[undersea data
flows, with]{.mark} the vast majority of
**[command-and-control]{.mark}** information flowing on
private]{.underline} undersea [cables]{.underline}.

[As]{.underline} international [security experts are **fearful** that an
era of **undersea conflict** is upon us, there is a compelling case for
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to]{.underline}
galvanize international action to **[protect]{.underline}** what author
and historian Aaron Bateman [calls the "soft underbelly of American
power]{.underline}."

Within several decades of the emergence of undersea communication
cables, states sought to protect their own and interfere with those of
their opponents including during the Spanish America War and, more
famously, World War I. But the volume of data flowing through today's
cables and its central role in intelligence and command and control far
exceeds that of previous eras of conflict. Given globalization and the
information revolution, the challenge is orders of magnitude greater.

Some experts argue that [there is an ongoing **[hybrid warfare]{.mark}**
campaign on Western infrastructure [waged by **Russia**, **China**, and
**nonstate actors**]{.mark}]{.underline} seeking to disrupt commerce and
undermine Western economic power. While China is widely understood as
the "pacing challenge" facing the United States, it is
[Russia]{.underline} that [has the most]{.underline} highly developed
[capacity to **[threaten]{.mark}** undersea
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia has recently made attacks
on seabed infrastructure a core objective of its modernized naval
strategy. Russia's navy is resuscitating its already sophisticated
submarine fleet by developing special purpose boats focused on seabed
warfare.

[Russia's **words** and **investments** have been backed by
**action**]{.underline}: Its survey ships have been spotted near
European energy seabed energy grids and windfarms, and its submarines
have been detected operating near some of the most crucial undersea
infrastructure in the world. According to the Finnish government,
Russia's so-called shadow fleet, which is hundreds of vessels strong and
was developed to avoid energy sanctions, may be involved in cable
cutting maneuvers in the Baltic Sea.

China's threat to the undersea infrastructure appears more limited, at
least doctrinally. Its co-dependence on global financial flows suggests
a limited interest in more widespread attacks in circumstances short of
war. And wider attacks, beyond the Asian littoral (on the financial
infrastructure of the West or the European energy grid), likely remain
beyond the scope of China's plan---at least, without Russian help.

Yet [in]{.underline} two [recent cases of damage]{.underline} to
undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, the [ships
involved]{.underline} have [both Chinese and Russian ties]{.underline}.
When the Balticconnector gas pipeline was damaged in October 2023, the
culprit was found to be the Hong Kong registered Newnew Polar Bear; but
the firm that owns the ship has ties to Russia, and it was sailing in
close proximity---for hundreds of miles---with a Russian hydrographic
ship, the Sevmorput, a nuclear-powered cargo ship owned by state agency
Rosatom.

Emerging technologies are introducing new dynamics to geostrategic
competition with uncertain implications for protecting and threatening
the undersea ecosystem. While the proliferation of undersea robotics may
make cable laying and maintenance easier, [uncrewed vessels]{.underline}
may also [provide]{.underline} the [[tools]{.underline}]{.mark}
necessary [[to **interfere**]{.mark} with cables [or **tap**]{.mark}
**into [cables]{.mark}** for intelligence]{.underline} purposes. In the
coming years, the [adoption of **SMART**]{.underline} ([Science
Monitoring and Reliable Telecommunications]{.underline}) [cables [raises
concerns]{.mark} that data]{.underline} generated by sensors [can be
**tapped** or **abused**]{.underline}, making information assurance
critical. How these contradictory possibilities play out over time are
unknown and very risky.

Moving [[beyond fiberoptic]{.mark} cables, the [**gray zone risk**
extends to]{.mark} the seabed **[energy]{.mark} grid** [and]{.mark}
**undersea [mining]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Increasingly the seabed is
crisscrossed by oil and gas pipelines, and by power cables sending
electricity from areas of abundance to areas where demand is high or
driving the operation of offshore facilities. Today researchers estimate
that there are approximately 750,000 miles of submarine power cables,
and industry observers believe that figure may double over the next
decade. As efforts to mine the deep seabed for rare earth materials
advance, the commercial and strategic stakes in the seabed will rise
further.

The immediate implications of the recent attacks tied to Russia and
China may have been exaggerated in some circles. But [[it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} well [past [time to address]{.mark} the real and
growing **[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** of the globe's undersea
infrastructure]{.underline}.

[There are many impediments to responding]{.underline} to states and
nonstate actors that intentionally cut a submarine cable.
[One]{.underline} difficulty [is **timely attribution**]{.underline};
accurate attribution is [necessary to **name** and **shame**, initiate
appropriate **legal action**, and]{.underline}, most important,
[**punish** the offender]{.underline}. Even when the malefactor can be
identified, quick responses to ships interfering with submarine cables
is challenging, especially in the open ocean. Protecting hundreds of
thousands of miles of cables is highly unlikely given the number of
vessels even theoretically available. The lack of clear legal authority
in international waters limits how a state or private firm can punish
hostile vessels. What is more, the favorite tool of the West in recent
years---sanctions---may not work here. Russia already labors under
extensive sanctions and may be impervious to further punishments; small
states subject to undersea aggression by Chinese actors may have limited
capacity to sanction. Even more powerful states victimized by cable
cutting may be hesitant to act given well-known attribution
difficulties.

Still, three steps can be taken to enhance deterrence by reducing
vulnerabilities and increasing costs to hostile actors.

[The [first **deterrence**]{.mark} strategy [is **denial**
through]{.mark} improved **[resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Whatever
the effects an offending state or nonstate entity is hoping to attain by
interfering with a submarine cable, the ability to swiftly repair a
break, and to maintain service through rerouting, will mitigate the
impact of the break and thus limit the reward for aggression. Even if
the adversary is interfering with cable as part of a larger and longer
campaign, efforts to restore service may be useful as well.

Second is "[[deterrence by detection]{.underline}]{.mark}": greater
visibility [[can]{.mark} help to "[deny
deniability]{.mark}]{.underline}." As James Bergeron, political advisor
to NATO Allied Maritime Command, has noted: "If a malefactor is going to
try to harass, undermine or clandestinely attack offshore infrastructure
... the main thing we seek to achieve is that they cannot get away with
it. Instead, they will be spotted, the cameras will be snapping, the
underwater sensors will be monitoring and there will be a signals trail
of liability."

[Better [detection will require **fast-tracking**]{.mark} the adoption
of **advanced technologies**]{.underline}, [**[quantum sensors]{.mark}**
collecting data]{.underline} for processing, underwater robotic systems,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[application of
**a**]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [[to]{.mark} sensing data. Each
can]{.underline} be used to [[enhance]{.underline}]{.mark} what we might
call **[[deterrence by detection]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But more reason
for the United States and its Western partners to move quicky:
[[Whichever country]{.underline}]{.mark} manages to
[[master]{.underline}]{.mark} emerging [undersea [tech]{.mark}nologies
[will have **first mover advantages**]{.mark}]{.underline} over its
competitors. It will be [able [to harvest]{.mark} more [data and
interfere, **undetected** and **undeterred**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
undersea critical infrastructure [by means unavailable to other
states]{.underline}.

**Unchecked attacks risk [miscalculation]{.underline} and
[embolden]{.underline} Russia by cutting communications early in
crisis.**

3.1---Russia and the Arctic seabed threat environment

On top of the aforementioned suspected activities (see Chapter 1),
[there is a **track record** of Russian interest in **disrupting data
cables**. Reports of suspicious [Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} seabed
[[activities]{.mark} date back to]{.underline} at least [the early
2010s]{.underline}. In 2013, a joint Nordic investigation flagged
Russia's seabed mapping activities in the Baltic and North Seas, [which
[shed light]{.mark} on]{.underline} the [Kremlin's [**willingness**
to]{.mark} use **civilian vessels** to potentially [**sabotage**
cables]{.mark}]{.underline}. 60

[Observations continued [during]{.mark} Russia's]{.underline} first
[[invasion of **Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2014-2015
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the illegal [annexation of
**[Crimea]{.mark}** when [Russian forces]{.mark} reportedly **[damaged
communication cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} on land. 61 US intelligence
and NATO started reporting intense seabed activity around the layout of
data cables by Russian submarines as early as 2015. 62 [[A]{.mark}
notable example is the Russian **[naval exercise]{.mark}**
which]{.underline} took place close to Ireland's EEZ [in February 2022,
[reported]{.mark} to be a [**demonstration** of]{.mark} cable
[disruption]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}. 63

[Cable [sabotage is part]{.mark} and parcel [of]{.mark} Russia's
**well-established toolkit** of plau[sibly deniable, **sub-threshold
activities** and]{.mark}]{.underline} other forms of [**[grey zone
disruptions]{.mark}**. For the Kremlin, cable sabotage is [an
**asymmetric enabler**, especially in]{.mark} case of [**escalation**
or]{.mark} at [the **initial period**]{.mark} **of war**, potentially
[giving Moscow **greater decision-making speed** against]{.mark} an
[adversary]{.mark} in the **early stages** of a conflict. The intended
objective is [to **blunt** an opponent's]{.mark} **ability to respond**
by limiting or shutting down [**military** and/or **civilian
comm**]{.mark}**unication[s]{.mark}** at the **onset** of a
conflict]{.underline}. 64

The Kremlin devolves resources to map submarine cables and conduct
intelligence gathering operations. In this effort, [seabed warfare has
an **intelligence function** in Russia]{.underline}, and not necessarily
a naval one. 65 [[Cable operations]{.mark} represent an important tool
in the informational and psychological preparation of the battlespace,
with the **aim to [break]{.mark}** [Western]{.mark} civilian
**[support]{.mark}** in a potential **escalation scenario** with
Russia]{.underline}. 66

The situation is compounded by the fact that [[Russia has]{.mark} a
strong **[incentive to probe]{.mark} the seabed** in order [to
**test**]{.mark} the **[resolve]{.mark}** and **response**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} Western countries and [[NATO. More
**provocations**]{.mark} and **disruptions** can therefore be expected
in the short and medium terms]{.underline}. In turn, [this]{.underline}
situation [[increase]{.mark}s the [risk of **miscalculation**]{.mark},
**tactical [errors]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **horizontal
[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

["Hybrid" scenarios: **trigger for conflict**?]{.underline}

One can envisage a [number of "[hybrid]{.mark}"
scenarios of **[Russia-NATO
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} where operations which [started in
the **cyber**, **economic**, **criminal**, or "**active
measure**" domains]{.underline}, below the threshold of
conflict, [[trigger]{.mark} a **[military response]{.mark}** or are
followed by the physical use of force]{.underline}. As noted in the
discussion on the definitions of
conflict, [[the **threshold**]{.underline}]{.mark} between crisis and military conflict [[may
not be]{.mark} **explicitly stated** or otherwise **[clear]{.mark}** to
all sides]{.underline}; [[and]{.mark} it may [also]{.mark}
be **[ignored]{.mark}** during a crisis]{.underline}. This aspect is
especially relevant in the current period of increased interference in
the internal affairs of NATO countries attributed to Russia and of
the high volume of information 'warfare' between Russia and NATO
countries.

Russia remains vigilant about foreign interference in its internal
affairs and the threat of subversion leading to a severe destabilization
of the regime. In the past, Moscow has made accusations about foreign
sponsorship of Chechen and radical Islamic terrorists targeting Russia,
and has alleged the existence of training camps on the territories of
NATO states for activists planning colour revolutions in Ukraine and
Belarus. In the extreme circumstances of a crisis, if the Russian
leadership became convinced that a non-military campaign against
it (which might also involve cyber activities and what Russia calls
attempts to instigate colour revolutions) had intensified, this could
lead to a military response.

With regards to NATO, some of its members' views mirror the Russian
assessment that we are already in a state of conflict, in which
the boundary between peace and war is blurred, and that their defences
are being actively attacked through nonmilitary
means. They are thus concerned about a scenario in which
Russia initiates an attack that moves swiftly from non-military to
military means. This scenario should be not dismissed. At the same time,
one needs to be wary of interpreting all disturbing developments as part
of a grand Russian plan culminating in a provocation or use of force.
So there should be prudence before any country presses the "panic
button" at the national or NATO / European Union level. There should
also be close analysis of early warning indicators related to the
gravity, intensity and diversity of incidents and to connections between
them. The overall political context and state of the RussiaNATO
relationship would also be important: what would be the political and
strategic reasons for Russia to move from sub-threshold to
abovethreshold activities?

Individual NATO countries would have a decisive role in how some of the
"hybrid" scenarios would play out. An Ally can choose to play down or up
the importance of certain developments and incidents; it can seek NATO
and/or EU support, decide to respond individually (including through
actions that are escalatory), or use a mix of both approaches. The
Ally's overall reputation and patterns of international behaviour can
matter for determining whether its "frontline" intelligence and
assessments are to be trusted. But given the danger of alliance
entrapment, NATO also needs to have multiple channels for corroborating
the evidence and assessing developments.

**[Escalation]{.underline}**: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[Once]{.underline} a conflict was [under way]{.underline}, [the "**[fog
of war]{.mark}**" and rising
unpredictability [would]{.mark} **inevitably** [set
in]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[complicating]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
implementation of any [predetermined
theories]{.mark} of escalation]{.underline}, [deescalation and inter-conflict
management]{.underline}. [The **[actual dynamics]{.mark}** of a conflict
and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are]{.mark}
**extremely [difficult]{.mark}** [to predict]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Simulations]{.underline} and table-top exercises can [give only
**limited insights**]{.underline} into the actual decisionmaking
processes and interactions.

Still, Russian military theorists and practitioners seem to assume that
a conflict with NATO can be managed and controlled in a way that would
bring it to a swift end consistent with Russian aims. The Russian theory
of victory would seek to exploit weak points in an Alliance war
effort. Based on the conviction that democracies are weak and their
leaders and populations are risk-averse, Russia may assume that its
threats of horizontal or vertical escalation could
be particularly effective. It would also try to bring home the notion
that it has much higher stakes in the conflict (regime survival) than a
majority of the NATO members involved, and thus will be ready to push
the boundaries of the conflict further. It would most likely try
to test and exploit potential divisions within the Alliance, combining
selective diplomacy and activation of its intelligence assets in some
NATO states with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[[Any]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO-Russia [[conflict
would]{.mark} inevitably [have a **nuclear
dimension**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **role** of
nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s as a tool for **escalation control** for
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} has been thoroughly debated by experts, but
when and how Russia might use (and not merely showcase or
activate) nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an open
question. Beyond catch phrases such as "[**[escalate to
de-escalate]{.underline}**" [or]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[escalate [to
win]{.mark}]{.underline}**" [there [are a]{.mark} **wider
[range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian nuclear]{.mark} weapon
[use]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, [a single nuc]{.underline}lear
[warning shot could be **lethal** or **non-lethal**]{.underline}.
[It could be directed against a **purely military** target or a
**military-civilian** one.]{.underline} [Detonation could be configured
for an **EMP effect**]{.underline}. [A **"false flag"** attack is also
conceivable]{.underline}. [These options might be used to **signal
escalation** and could significantly **complicate** NATO's
responses]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the conflict to
achieve these goals, and what mechanisms and means it would use while
trying to maintain some degree of control over the conflict.

The goals and methods of waging a conflict with Russia would probably
have to be limited in order to avoid a massive nuclear exchange. Such
limitations would also involve restrictions on striking back against
targets on Russian territory. But too narrow an approach could put too
much restraint on NATO's operations: the Russian regime's stability may
ultimately need to be threatened in order to force the leadership into
terminating the conflict. NATO would thus need to establish what a
proportional self-defence response to Russian actions would involve, and
to what extent cyber operations or attacks against military targets in
quite different parts of Russia would be useful as tools of escalation
to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO Allies, especially
those directly affected by Russia's actions, might pursue their
individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

Relying on concepts of escalation control and on lessons from the Cold
War confrontation might be misleading. The circumstances in which a
Russia -NATO conflict would play out would be radically different from
the 20th century screenplay. Moreover, instead
of gradual (linear) escalation or salami tactics escalation, it is
possible to imagine surprizing "leap frog"
escalation, possibly connected with actions in different domains (e.g.
a cyberattack against critical infrastructure). Flexibility, good
intelligence and inventiveness in responding to such developments would
be crucial.

**[Conflict termination]{.underline}**

Russian and NATO [assumptions regarding conflict
termination would **most likely not survive** the first hours of an
**actual** conflict]{.underline}. [[Both]{.mark} sides [are]{.mark}
capable of **[underestimating]{.mark}** the [**resolve** of the
other]{.mark} side to prevail in a conflict and the other
side's **willingness to commit** the necessary resources and endure the
costs, **especially** once both sides start
committing their **p**olitical **c**apital and **resources** and the casualties
accumulate]{.underline}.

**Quantum sensors [deter attacks]{.underline} and [predict
outages]{.underline} to enable [fast repairs]{.underline}.**

Although sabotage caused by nefarious actors operating in the grey-zone
is primarily discussed in the media when it comes to subsea cable
security, in reality, more [often **[cable faults]{.mark}** are a result
[of **trawling** or **anchors**]{.mark} from fishing vessels and
environmental occurrences]{.underline}. Depending on the location where
the fault occurs, [particularly [at]{.mark} **bottlenecks** or
**[chokepoints]{.mark}**, they [can be]{.mark} **equally [as
devastating]{.mark}** [as a **planned attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, in March of this year, [[a]{.mark}n underwater
[rockslide]{.mark}]{.underline} off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire
[[impacted]{.mark} thirteen [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
continent, [[causing]{.mark} "a **[near-total Internet
outage]{.mark}**"]{.underline} in Côte d'Ivoire alone, [and [disrupting
service]{.mark}]{.underline} for over 17 million customers.23
[**[Quantum sensing]{.mark}** technologies offer an ability to
[**sense** and **monitor**]{.mark} the marine environment, [from
**tracking**]{.mark} the **progression of [climate]{.mark} change**
[to]{.mark} recording **[seismic activity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.24 [The
[application]{.mark} of quantum sensors [to subsea]{.mark} **fibre-optic
[cables]{.mark}** [could]{.mark} equip cable systems with the ability to
[detect]{.mark} underwater [**earthquakes** and **tsunamis**,
integrating]{.mark} into]{.underline} an **[[early
warning]{.underline}]{.mark}** system. [[Resilience]{.mark} of
the]{.underline} broader [subsea cable system [is as much about]{.mark}
**increasing [proactivity]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} it is about
**[response]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, the significant increase in
accuracy quantum sensing offers will clearly have a positive impact on
the overall resilience of the cable system. [[In]{.mark} the realm of
[**defence**, quantum]{.mark} sensing [could]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[assist]{.mark} in the [**detection** and **identification**]{.mark} of
submersible vessels. [Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} deployment of
vessels to map critical seabed infrastructure as well as its
[[suspected]{.underline}]{.mark} engagement in [subsea **cable
[sabotage]{.mark}**]{.underline} through submarines such as Losharik
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[be diminished
with]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies such as [[**quantum sensing**
that]{.mark} could [lead to **vessel identification**]{.mark}, therefore
[denying]{.mark} the actor the coveted [anonymity and plausible
deniability]{.mark}]{.underline} associated [with **sub-threshold**
activity]{.underline}.25 [[This]{.mark} method of '[deterrence]{.mark}
by detection' h[as been suggested]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
**[[cost-effective]{.underline}]{.mark}** short-term [solution [to
**boost**]{.mark}**ing [resilience]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} "hostile
[actors are **less likely to attack**]{.mark} undersea infrastructure
[if they know]{.mark}]{.underline} (or suspect) [[they are]{.mark} being
[watched]{.mark}]{.underline}".26 [Whilst there are current
technologies]{.underline} such as distributed motion and acoustic
sensoring [which provide]{.underline} fibre-optic [cables with
monitoring]{.underline} capacity, [[quantum]{.mark} sensors
[make]{.mark} technological [devices "exponentially more
**accurate**]{.mark}, more **[thorough]{.mark}**, more [**efficient**,
and]{.mark} more **[productive]{.mark}**]{.underline}".27 It is
acknowledged, however, that although quantum sensing can contribute to
data collection and notification of impending faults, quantum sensors do
not protect the continuous flow of information once a cable has faulted.
Yet, as mentioned above, it is important to underscore that the
resilience of the subsea cable system should not merely be viewed in
respect to cable severance and post-fault redundancy. [[Quantum
sensors]{.mark} cannot prevent a cable from being severed,
but]{.underline} it [[can]{.mark} help [advise **how to**]{.mark} **best
[reroute traffic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the [data]{.mark} it gathers
[can **lead to predictions**]{.mark} as [to **where** and
**when**]{.mark} a [fault is likely]{.mark} to occur, [and]{.mark} the
sensors can [give]{.mark} **sufficient [advance warning]{.mark}**
[so]{.mark} that **[repair]{.mark} ships** [can be]{.mark} mobilized
[sooner]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further evidence that these contributions
would positively impact the industry can be found in the European
Commission's recommendations. As the report underscores, "security and
resilience increases would include scoping of physical and logical
redundancy in a project, high security standards and technology, such as
sensor and monitoring systems, as well as the capacity of the
deployment, maintenance and repair vessel fleet".28

**Internet outages are [existential]{.underline}.**

David **Eagleman 10**, neuroscientist at Stanford University and
Guggenheim Fellow, \"Six ways the internet will save civilisation\",
WIRED, https://www.wired.com/story/apocalypse-no/, 11-9-10//ILake-AW

[Many great [civilisations]{.mark}]{.underline} [[have
**fallen**]{.mark},]{.underline} leaving nothing but cracked ruins and
scattered genetics. Usually [this results [from]{.mark}]{.underline}:
**[natural [disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[resource
depletion]{.underline}**, [[**economic meltdown**, **disease**]{.mark},
poor information]{.underline} [flow and corruption. [But]{.mark} we're
luckier]{.underline} than our predecessors [because we]{.underline}
[command]{.underline} a technology that no one else possessed: [a
**rapid communication** network]{.underline} that finds its highest
expression [in **the [internet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I propose that
there are six ways in which [the net [has]{.mark}]{.underline} vastly
[[reduced]{.mark} the [threat of]{.mark} **societal
[collapse]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Epidemics can be deflected by telepresence

[One of our]{.underline} more [dire prospects]{.underline} for collapse
[is an infectious-disease]{.underline} epidemic. Viral and bacterial
**[epidemics]{.underline}** [precipitated the fall]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the Golden Age of [Athens, the Roman
Empire]{.underline} and most of the empires of the Native Americans.
[The int[ernet can be our **key to survival**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[because the ability to work **telepresently**]{.underline} [can inhibit
microbial transmission]{.underline} by reducing human-to-human contact.
In the face of an otherwise devastating epidemic, [businesses can keep
supply chains running]{.underline} with the maximum number of employees
working from home. [This can reduce host density]{.underline} **[below
the tipping point]{.underline}** required for an epidemic. If we are
well prepared when an epidemic arrives, we can fluidly shift into a
self-quarantined society in which microbes fail due to host scarcity.
Whatever the social ills of isolation, they are worse for the microbes
than for us.

The internet will predict natural disaster

We are witnessing the downfall of slow central control in the media:
news stories are increasingly becoming user-generated nets of
up-to-the-minute information. During the recent California wildfires,
locals went to the TV stations to learn whether their neighbourhoods
were in danger. But the news stations appeared most concerned with the
fate of celebrity mansions, so Californians changed their tack: they
uploaded geotagged mobile-phone pictures, updated Facebook statuses and
tweeted. The balance tipped: the internet carried news about the fire
more quickly and accurately than any news station could. In this
grass-roots, decentralised scheme, there were embedded reporters on
every block, and the news shockwave kept ahead of the fire. This head
start could provide the extra hours that save us. If the Pompeiians had
had the internet in 79AD, they could have easily marched 10km to safety,
well ahead of the pyroclastic flow from Mount Vesuvius. If the Indian
Ocean had the Pacific's networked tsunami-warning system, South-East
Asia would look quite different today.

Discoveries are retained and shared

Historically, critical information has required constant rediscovery.
Collections of learning \-- from the library at Alexandria to the entire
Minoan civilisation \-- have fallen to the bonfires of invaders or the
wrecking ball of natural disaster. [Knowledge is hard won but **easily
lost**]{.underline}. And information that survives often does not
spread. Consider smallpox inoculation: this was under way in India,
China and Africa centuries before it made its way to Europe. By the time
the idea reached North America, native civilisations who needed it had
already collapsed. [The net solved the problem]{.underline}. [New
discoveries catch on immediately; information **spreads
widely**]{.underline}. In this way, [societies can
optimally]{.underline} [ratchet]{.underline} [up]{.underline}, using the
latest bricks of knowledge [in their **fortification against
risk**]{.underline}.

**[Tyranny is mitigated]{.underline}**

[Censorship of ideas was]{.underline} [a **familiar
spectre**]{.underline} in the last century, with state-approved news
outlets ruling the press, airwaves and copying machines in the USSR,
Romania, Cuba, China, Iraq and elsewhere. In many cases, such as
[Lysenko's]{.underline} agricultural [despotism in the
**USSR**]{.underline}, it [directly contributed to the **collapse of the
nation**]{.underline}. Historically, [a more successful strategy has
been]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[confront free
speech]{.underline}** with free speech \-- and [[the internet]{.mark}
allows this]{.underline} in a natural way. [It
**[democratises]{.mark}**]{.underline} the flow of [[infor]{.mark}mation
by offering access to the newspapers of the world]{.underline}, the
photographers of every nation, the [bloggers of every political
stripe]{.underline}. Some posts are full of doctoring and dishonesty
whereas others strive for independence and impartiality \-- but all are
available to us to sift through. Given the attempts by some governments
to build firewalls, it's clear that this benefit of the net requires
constant vigilance.

Human capital is vastly increased

[Crowdsourcing brings people together to **solve
problems**]{.underline}. Yet far [fewer than **one per cent** of the
world's population is involved]{.underline}. We need expand human
capital. Most of the world not have access to the education afforded a
small minority. For every Albert Einstein, Yo-Yo Ma or Barack Obama who
has educational opportunities, uncountable others do not. [This
**squandering of talent** translates into **reduced economic output**
and a **smaller pool** of problem solvers]{.underline}. [The net
opens]{.underline} the [gates education to **anyone** with a
computer]{.underline}. A motivated teen anywhere on the planet can walk
through the world's knowledge \-- from the webs of Wikipedia to the
curriculum of MIT's OpenCourseWare. [The new human capital [will
serve]{.mark} us [well when we **confront existential
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} we've never imagined before.

Energy expenditure is reduced

Societal collapse can often be understood in terms of an energy budget:
when energy spend outweighs energy return, collapse ensues. This has
taken the form of deforestation or soil erosion; currently, the worry
involves fossil-fuel depletion. [The internet addresses the **energy
problem**]{.underline} with a natural ease. [Consider the massive energy
savings inherent in the shift from **paper to electrons**]{.underline}
\-- as seen in the transition from the post to email. [Ecommerce reduces
the need to **drive long distances**]{.underline} to purchase products.
Delivery trucks are more eco-friendly than individuals driving around,
not least because of tight packaging and optimisation algorithms for
driving routes. Of course, there are energy costs to the banks of
computers that underpin the internet \-- but these [costs]{.underline}
are less than the wood, coal and oil that would be expended for the same
quantity of information flow.

[The]{.underline} tangle of [events that triggers **societal collapse**
can be **complex**]{.underline}, and there are several threats the net
does not address. [But]{.underline} vast, [[networked communication
can]{.underline} [be an **antidote** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[several]{.underline} of the most [[deadly diseases **threatening
civilisation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The next time your coworker laments
internet addiction, the banality of tweeting or the decline of
face-to-face conversation, you may want to suggest that [the net may
just be the technology that **saves us**]{.underline}.

The world is not wireless. The internet is not located in "clouds," nor
does it rely on the increasing number of satellites placed into orbit.
On the contrary, [the]{.underline} functioning of [[**internet**
and]{.mark} all transoceanic **[digital
communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}s [[is based on
**fiber**]{.mark}**-optic [cables]{.mark}**]{.underline}---20 to 50
millimeters in diameter (Figure 1)---lying [at the bottom of the
**oceans** and **seas**. The]{.underline} global [cable
network]{.underline} consists of approximately of 450 submarine cable
systems and 1.2 million kilometers of submarine cable (Nagpal 2019) and
[handles **99 percent** of international **data traffic**]{.underline}
(including international internet). Yet this critically important
infrastructure escapes our eyes and minds and remains almost invisible.
Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
Internet of Things (**[[IoT]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[**5G**,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} Software as a Service
(**[[SaaS]{.underline}]{.mark}**)---to name only a few examples---are
omnipresent buzzwords used to [describe how lives will change globally.
Should]{.underline} future [scenarios referring to the tremendous
**[increase]{.mark}** in daily **[data generation per capita]{.mark}**
be realized]{.underline} (Huawei estimation quoted by the Nordic Council
of Ministers report refers to an increase from approximately 4 GB in
2008 to 72 GB in 2025 (Nordic Council of Ministers 2018)) [even
partially, a [demand for **new cable capacity** is evident
as]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[current]{.underline}]{.mark}
communications [[infrastructure cannot satisfy]{.underline}]{.mark} the
needs and [[demands]{.underline}]{.mark} of advancing digitalization.

In the article, the network is understood in a two-fold manner. First,
it refers to the very physical, technical infrastructure consisting of
the landing stations as well as the fiber-optic cables, repeaters,
equalizer units, and branching units that lie on the seabed and transmit
packets of digital communication. This structure develops when
communication needs increase, political and geographical circumstances
allow, and strong enough economic and business incentives exist for its
supplementation. Second, it refers to network as a metaphor to explain
societal evolution: reason political, economic, religious, judicial, and
cultural decision making, and describe events taking place around the
world. The network metaphor can be used to describe a long historical
process defined by the increasing interaction and thickening links
between people locally, regionally, and then globally (e.g. McNeill and
McNeill 2003). In addition, it may refer to an organizing, including
self-organization, principle that currently seems globally dominant. The
evolvement of this open, agile, and to an extent borderless network that
generates new links and cuts out old ones when useful is much faster and
less predictable than evolvement of the physical infrastructure---or the
historical process (Eriksson 2009).

According to John R. McNeill and William H. McNeill (2003, 269), the
physical construction of a global communications network enabled the
connection of areal political, economic, religious, judicial, and
cultural webs into a global network---alongside the development of
railroads, shipping routes, and navigation enabled by technical
innovations. Simultaneously, the network construction formed a
conceptual model for understanding societal events (Eriksson 2009, 7).
Towards the end of the twentieth century, this network extended and its
tightening accelerated, which was largely facilitated by innovations in
information and communications technologies (ICTs). [The [global
**intertwinement**]{.mark} of]{.underline} (national) [economies and
the]{.underline} emergence of novel [social spaces [enabled
by]{.mark}]{.underline} (close to) **[[global
connectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}** of individuals and groupings, [[is
transforming societies]{.mark} significantly]{.underline} (see e.g.
Castells 2010). [Digitalization]{.underline} of societal practices and
structures, again, [is [requesting **further innovations**]{.mark} in
ICTs, increased communication **transmission capacity**]{.underline},
conversion of a number of different technological fields, [and learning
processes [to **sustain** these]{.mark} **societal [practices]{.mark}**
and **structures**]{.underline} (Castells 2010, 51--53; 54--61).

[The fiber-optic]{.underline} submarine [cable network]{.underline} is
thus not only a neutral, technical construction that operates as a
connector of flows through links and nodes. Instead, it [generates
interactions and transmits ideas and practices that **shape societies**
around the world]{.underline}. Links, nodes, and choke points of the
network gain their meaning as parts of the entity and its operations,
which also politicizes them. Locations (and businesses and communities)
gain identity through their position and function as part of the network
rather than because of their local importance (Eriksson 2009, 8). For
example, the location of a landing station entails the promises of
economic development and intensified information exchange for the local
community. However, where the submarine communications cable lands is
not decided on the basis of local needs, but cost- and time-efficiency
calculations for and structural setting of the entire cable network. At
the same time, landing stations raise environmental concerns and
experiences of loss or rejection in the communities that interpret their
situation as outsiders or excluded from the network.

Besides explaining what the submarine communications [[cables
are]{.underline}]{.mark} and why they are so
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}, this article introduces key
characteristics of the existing global cable network and describes the
changes it is [undergoing]{.underline} at present. It pays attention to
two present and [future challenges: [namely]{.mark}, the [**slowness**
or lack of **faster connections** and **concentration**]{.mark}
of]{.underline} critical communications [infrastructure. [Both]{.mark}
of these **problems** [contribute to]{.mark} the emergence of [**choke
points** that **decrease**]{.mark} **trust** in the
**[reliability]{.mark}** of the infrastructure [on which]{.mark} the
[**smooth functioning** of]{.mark} contemporary [**societies** and
**networked lifestyles** depend]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The article finally analyzes recent [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
submarine communications [cable [projects]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
potential solution to both limitations. These projects, such as the
Arctic Connect project or the project of Quintillion Subsea Holdings,
[would [introduce **new routes**, bringing **network diversity** and
**lowering latency**]{.mark}, but they have not
materialized]{.underline}---at least, they have been postponed to this
point. Therefore, these projects can be considered as useful case
studies when analyzing the reasons that politicize and restrain the
long-awaited changes in the global submarine fiber-optic cable network.
Alongside research literature, this article is based on the analysis of
recent texts in professional journals and newspapers. Additional data
has been collected through semi-structured interviews and participatory
observation (see Table 1 at the end of the article) since early 2017 in
meetings of cable-industry experts.

[[Amid]{.mark} multiplying [**global crises**, there is]{.mark} an
**urgent [need]{.mark}** to tackle pressing global challenges by
**[leveraging]{.mark}** existing [**advanced solutions**
that]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[unlock]{.mark} **[unprecedented
opportunities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rising above sub-optimal rivalries
and competition to execute [these solutions create]{.underline}s the
potential [[for a]{.mark} **secure**, **[sustainable]{.mark}** and
**superior** [future]{.mark} for all]{.underline}.

This report outlines that path, presenting transformative solutions that
exist today and the trillions of dollars in markets they can catalyze.
The report finds that [the opportunity to create new markets globally is
immense]{.underline}, with an estimated \$15 trillion potential in the
developing world alone, projected to grow to \$60 trillion by 2060, with
a GDP of US\$350 trillion. [The **[SDGs]{.mark}** offer **major
opportunities** for countries that [can leverage tech]{.mark}nology as a
**key enabler** of change, [offering]{.mark} **economic
[growth]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **job security**, improved **national
[security]{.mark}**, **technology leadership** and the opening of **new
markets**]{.underline}. It is a "win-win" if ambitious countries lean
into the challenge presented by the SDGs, tackling them as
opportunities, not as costs.

Nine "Big Idea" solutions, enabled by 19 identified technologies, which
can substantially meet the SDGs, but require essential policies that
remove the barriers to the flow of solutions, technologies and
investments to the places where they are most needed. A sub-set of these
technologies even has the potential to create a future superior to the
one envisaged by the SDGs. Critically, [these [solutions solve]{.mark}
for the most intractable **[human and environmental challenges]{.mark}**
of our times, from **[poverty]{.mark}** and
**[hunger]{.mark}**,]{.underline} populations left-behind [[and
**climate change**]{.mark}. They unlock the **ingenuity** required to
raise the world]{.underline}.

[The world is in a **historic transition** to the **Information
Age**]{.underline}, and at this crossroads, if we follow the
well-trodden path of history, we create a transition built on predatory,
power politics and economic hegemony for those that have the technology
and the wealth over those that do not. This path will spur rivalry and
conflict, endangering many across the world. However, a better version
of us can choose a path built on collaboration and shared prosperity,
with no one left behind. The level of the world's solutions and the
science, technology, global networks of trade, finance and distribution
are perfectly suited to such an agenda. [Technology has the potential to
create a **superior sustainable future** with human security for all at
its core]{.underline}. The choices the world makes about which path to
take will determine whether this is a better future for all or just
some, and how painful the transition will be.

I. Technology's Role in a World in Crisis and Transition and Power Shift

[The world is [facing]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[[unprecedented]{.underline}]{.mark} set of [[crises whose impacts
threaten]{.mark} to **overwhelm** [the]{.mark}
**[l]{.mark}**]{.underline}iberal
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rder [[in]{.mark} a time of [the]{.mark}
**global [transition]{.mark}** [to the **Info**]{.mark}**rmation
[Age]{.mark}** [and tech]{.mark}nology [is a **key enabler**]{.mark} of
this transition]{.underline}, which is fueling competition between
nations and companies.

▪ World Facing a [[Polycrisis]{.underline}]{.mark} Threatening the
International Order. A series of [interrelated economic, environmental,
social, and political crises [are posing]{.mark} increasingly
**[existential threats]{.mark}** to]{.underline} countries around [the
world]{.underline}, threatening to overwhelm countries' abilities to
respond in a coordinated fashion, undermining the international order.

▪ Global Transition Underway. [This polycrisis is a source of
**significant disruption**]{.underline} to the broader global transition
underway from a past built on fossil fuels and industrials to one built
on new energies and information technologies, [[resulting in
political]{.mark}, social, economic, [security and environmental
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} between those building the future, those
resisting change, and opportunists.

▪ Technology Is a Critical Enabler of the Transition and Source of Power
and Wealth. Technology, particularly digital technology, is a critical
enabler of this global change, with 19 technologies identified that can
deliver both geopolitical power and wealth creation being the subject of
fierce competition.

▪ Technology's Significant Potential as a Force for Good. Technology is
a powerful change agent in the world, the scientific progress driving
innovation breakthroughs appears to be unstoppable. Ensuring that
breakthroughs are a force for good in the world, improving outcomes and
human security for all, however, needs to be a conscious choice, whose
implementation is a multistakeholder effort involving policy makers,
technology companies and product end users, creating an overlapping
system of tech oversight, development, deployment and use within shared
ethical frameworks.

II\. Lifting the World: Harnessing Technology to Meet the SDGs

[Progress on]{.underline} the UN Sustainable Development Goals
(**[[SDGs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [is failing, and]{.underline} their
success [[hinge]{.mark}s [on]{.mark}]{.underline} the world\'s [[ability
to quickly **implement**]{.mark} **scalable [mass solutions]{.mark}**,
in which technology plays a critical role. [This]{.mark} however
[requires addressing]{.mark}]{.underline} critical [[barriers to
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark} around the world, relating to
technology access, policy, finance and trust.

▪ The SDGS are Failing and Increasingly Unaffordable. Despite global
efforts, none of the 17 SDGs are currently on trajectory for full
realization by 2030 and, with an annual funding gap of US\$14--17
trillion are increasingly unaffordable, highlighting the urgent need for
transformative efforts.

▪ Nine Big Idea Solutions for 88% SDG Achievement. Nine 'Big Idea'
[solutions with proven use cases]{.underline} across policy, finance,
service delivery, capacity building and civil society, among others, all
of [which are tech based or tech-enabled, have the potential to drive
global SDG progress to nearly 90%,]{.underline} and global technology
companies are well suited to lead in their deployment.

▪ Over Four Billion People Can be Digitally Included.
[[Universal]{.underline}]{.mark} technology [[access is key]{.mark} to
unlocking its **positive impact potential**, [implying]{.mark} the [need
to **fully digitally include** a further 4.4 billion]{.mark} people
worldwide]{.underline}. This will require a 'solutions stack' to be
implemented comprising policies and regulations, infrastructure,
hardware and software and even cultural norms. III. Creating Whole New
Markets is the Key to Levelling Up the World Deploying the Big Idea
Solutions in the places where they are most needed, transforming
development needs into commercial opportunities, removing barriers to
private sector engagement, building local capacities to create new
markets that drive economic growth and development.

▪ US\$15 Trillion Markets to Be Created. The total market opportunity
(across trade, consumption and investment) of meeting the SDGs is US\$15
trillion globally, with 29 countries having the potential for
incremental US\$100 billion or greater opportunities each.

▪ Multiple Trillion Dollar Opportunity Sets. There are multiple
trillion-dollar opportunity sets arising from the SDGs, led by Food
Systems (US\$3.2 trillion), climate change, biodiversity and pollution
(US\$2.4 trillion), Solutions driving Gender Equality (US\$2.4 trillion)
and Inclusive Digitization (US\$2.1 trillion).

▪ Raising Countries and Unlocking Solution Deployment Requires Policy as
a Catalyst. Addressing these barriers requires policy reform and
capacity building, which are a catalyst for transforming development
needs into commercial opportunities, creating new markets to attract
solutions and capital.

IV\. Creating the Future: Transforming the World Beyond Sustainable
Development

A subset of the 19 core technologies identified are key to the world's
longer-term transition to a sustainable secure and superior future,
expected to generate trillions of dollars of economic value before the
end of the decade.

▪ 19 Technologies Can Create US\$61 trillion in Value by 2030.
Cumulatively, the 19 technologies are projected to create US\$61
trillion in annual economic value by the end of the decade.

▪ Four Ready-to-Deploy Technologies Have Potential Value of US\$35
trillion. Four [[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} alone
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential]{.underline}]{.mark} to
deliver more than US\$35 trillion by 2030: **[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(US\$16.5 trillion), **[[IoT]{.underline}]{.mark}** (US\$9.1 Trillion),
Robotics (US\$6.8 trillion) and Renewables (US\$5.2 trillion).

▪ Six Technologies are the Long-term Creators of the Future. In addition
to AI, six technologies, Nanotechnology, Fusion,
**[[Quantum]{.underline}]{.mark}** Computing, AR/VR/XR, Autonomous
Systems, and Gene Editing, [[are awaiting
breakthroughs]{.underline}]{.mark} and/or scaling [[that will]{.mark}
make them **commercially ready**, driving **exponential growth** to
[transform the world]{.mark}]{.underline} and delivering 'Great Power'
status to those that master them.

Psychological Warfare and Information Operations

As noted, [the]{.underline} apparent [threat]{.underline} is the cutting
of cables to directly damage the cable infrastructure. However, [the
**psychological impact** of cable vulnerabilities extends]{.underline}
far [beyond]{.underline} direct [communication disruptions]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} mere [possibility of [cable interference]{.mark} can
[create significant **anxiety**]{.mark} in **financial markets** [and
**erode public confidence**]{.mark} in critical
infrastructure]{.underline}. The November 2024 cable incident in the
Baltic Sea is a case in point, where [any incident]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} automatically [connected to adversaries]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} a growing [insecurity is playing]{.underline} [out
in]{.underline} official [media and national security
organizations]{.underline}. This **[psychological
vulnerability]{.underline}** [can be [exploited]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} **[carefully [orchestrated
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[combining cable
disruptions]{.underline} [with information operations]{.underline} [and
**economic pressure**.]{.underline}

[This strategy]{.underline} [has become obvious in]{.underline} [the
Baltic region and Taiwan]{.underline}, where [public opinion
is]{.underline} seriously [debating what individual states]{.underline}
can do to counter such actions and if the malign states are not better
equipped to act, despite, for example, Finland's quick response in the
case of the November 20 incident that has potentially proven not to be a
government orchestrated operation, this time.2 [[Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark} have [effectively]{.underline}
[[used]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**fear of disconnection**
to]{.underline} [influence]{.underline}]{.mark} [national
**[decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and **public
opinion**]{.underline}, as [well as flaunting what they]{.underline}
possibly [could do]{.underline}. [The psychological impact
is]{.underline} particularly [pronounced in **highly digitized
economies**]{.underline}, such as Taiwan and the extended Baltic region,
[where]{.underline} brief [[interruptions in connectivity]{.mark} can
[trigger **widespread panic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic
disruption. [This creates a]{.underline} form of **[psychological
leverage]{.underline}** [by authoritarian actors]{.underline} that has
been exploited without requiring large-scale cable damage.

Additionally, [cable disruptions]{.underline} can be [with
**synchronized disinformation**]{.underline} campaigns to
[amplify]{.underline} their [psychological impact]{.underline}, i.e.
weakness of the political system, military capability, etc. [[By
targeting]{.underline}]{.mark} specific [[cables]{.underline}
[during]{.underline}]{.mark} periods of [social or **[political
tension]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} could
[[create **info**]{.mark}**rmation [vacuums]{.mark}** [that
facilitate]{.mark}]{.underline} [the spread of
**[disinfo]{.mark}rmation**,]{.underline} even if it also would decrease
the attacker's ability to use digital means for disinformation. [The
resultant **uncertainty** and confusion]{.underline} could be exploited
to [undermine]{.underline} **[public confidence]{.underline}** [and
social cohesion]{.underline}. Many vessels involved in the attacks are
under a different flag than the suspected attacker. For example, the
attack on Taiwan cables in January 2025 was done by a commercial ship
owned by Jie Tan Trading Limited of Hong Kong, headed by Guo Wenjie, a
Peoples Republic of China (PRC) citizen, but the ship is registered in
Cameroon.3 While the use of a different f lag deceives no one, this
particular practice creates insecurity that harms citizens and
complicates effective responses.

[The psychological effects are]{.underline} [often
asymmetric]{.underline}, with even [[minor disruptions]{.underline}
[caus]{.underline}]{.mark}[ing]{.underline}
[**[disproportionate]{.mark}** public [reactions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [perceived attacks]{.underline} on the underwater cables in the
Baltic Sea in 2024 and Taiwan in 2025 [are evidence of actions
that]{.underline} seemingly do not directly impact but
[outline]{.underline} the [relative weakness of the impacted
actors]{.underline}. This [asymmetry]{.underline} makes cable attacks
particularly attractive for actors seeking to [maximize psychological
impact]{.underline} while minimizing physical infrastructure damage. The
[attribution challenges]{.underline} associated with cable attacks
further [**compound** these psychological effects]{.underline}, as
[[uncertainty]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[source]{.underline}]{.mark}** of disruptions can [[amplify]{.mark}
**public [anxiety ]{.mark}**[and **political
tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Economic Warfare and Financial System Vulnerability

The [economic implications of **cable disruptions**]{.underline} [extend
[throughout the **global financial
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Modern [financial [markets rely
on]{.mark}]{.underline} ultra-low latency [[connections for]{.mark}
trading and **[transaction]{.mark} processing**]{.underline}. [Even
**[millisecond delays]{.mark}**]{.underline} can [trigger]{.underline}
[algorithmic]{.underline} trading [responses]{.underline} [that
**[cascade]{.mark}**]{.underline} through markets, potentially [[causing
**significant** ]{.mark}**financial [losses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) estimates that a [significant
cable disruption]{.underline} [could [affect **trillion** dollars
in]{.mark}]{.underline} daily [financial [flows]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Disruptions]{.underline} to undersea telecommunications cables can
[profoundly affect **cryptocurrency**]{.underline} operations,
[exposing]{.underline} the networks' [decentralized architecture
and]{.underline} their [dependence on]{.underline} physical [internet
infrastructure]{.underline}. When these critical arteries of global
connectivity are compromised, the [repercussions ripple]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} [the entire]{.underline} cryptocurrency
[ecosystem]{.underline}, [manifesting in]{.underline} multiple forms of
**[operational degradation]{.underline}**. Financial markets face
particular vulnerability during these events. Major cryptocurrency
exchanges, despite their sophisticated infrastructure, may experience
service [[interruptions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[trigger **heightened
market volatility**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The impact
extends]{.underline} beyond traditional cryptocurrency trading
[to]{.underline} the [broader decentralized finance]{.underline}
ecosystem, where smart contracts and automated market makers require
continuous, reliable internet connectivity to function effectively.
While [blockchain]{.underline} technology was conceived as a resilient,
distributed system, the reality of its implementation [reveals a
**critical dependency**]{.underline} [on the physical
architecture]{.underline} [of global internet
infrastructure]{.underline}. This vulnerability becomes particularly
acute during cable disruptions, highlighting the need for robust
contingency measures and infrastructure redundancy in the cryptocurrency
sector.

[Key [vulnerable sectors include]{.mark}]{.underline}, but are not
limited to:

[**High-frequency trading** operations]{.underline} which require
constant, low-latency connectivity

[**[International banking]{.mark}** systems]{.underline} and SWIFT
network operations

Cloud-based services [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [data
centers]{.underline}

[**[Global supply chain]{.mark}** management]{.underline} systems

[International payment processing]{.underline} networks

Attacking these areas in the economic system could indeed be a crude
instrument if one depends on the international financial system, and
especially as China is trying to diversify its reliance on the currently
U.S.-dominated system. Still, [[for]{.mark} actors]{.underline} outside
the global monetary system, [such as [**Russia** or
**Iran**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as two examples, [[they would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [**cost-[effective]{.mark}**
[measures]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that impact the
adversary]{.underline}]{.mark} [to a higher degree]{.underline}.

[Sustained or repeated]{.underline} cable [disruptions]{.underline} can
[affect economic behavior]{.underline} and investment patterns.
[[Companies]{.underline}]{.mark} may begin to [[factor]{.mark} in
connectivity [risk when making investment]{.mark}
decisions]{.underline}, potentially [[leading to **market
distortions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and altered capital]{.underline}
[flows]{.underline}. The insurance market for cable infrastructure has
already seen significant changes, with higher premiums reflecting
increased risk perception. Sophisticated actors can use cable
disruptions for targeted economic warfare. By identifying and disrupting
specific cable routes, [attackers]{.underline} can:

[Create]{.underline} artificial [latency advantages]{.underline} in
financial trading

Force traffic onto more easily monitored backup routes

[Disrupt]{.underline} **[specific economic sectors]{.underline}** [or
geographic regions]{.underline}

[**Manipulate** market]{.underline} [behavior]{.underline} through
strategic timing of disruptions

[[Targeting]{.mark} multiple [cables]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[simultaneously]{.underline}**]{.mark} [or coordinating
disruptions]{.underline} with other forms of economic pressure [can
[**magnify** the financial impact]{.mark}]{.underline}. This compound
effect can **[[overwhelm]{.underline}]{.mark}** standard [[market
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} mechanisms [and challenge]{.underline}
[traditional]{.underline} economic [security frameworks]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} behavior [also **increases the weakness** of economic
systems]{.underline}, and it would not be hard to imagine rogue states
forcing commercial activities into less secure backup routes to skim
money out of transactions.

[During]{.underline}, in anticipation of, [or to **incite**]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} crisis or **[conflict]{.underline}**, [an
actor]{.underline} [could employ]{.underline} subconventional
[**[info]{.mark}rmation [warfare]{.mark}** [campaigns]{.mark}
to]{.underline} [[sow division]{.underline}, **[erode public
confidence]{.underline}**, [and **delay**]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[effective]{.underline} official [[response]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
public confusion and disorder that followed an [erroneous cell phone
alert]{.underline} [warning]{.underline} residents [in
Hawaii]{.underline} of an imminent ballistic missile threat in 2018
[serve as a worrying]{.underline} [sign]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
the [vulnerabilities]{.underline} [of US civil defenses]{.underline}
against anyone seeking asymmetric advantages vis-à-vis a superior
adversary. North Korea, for example, might conceivably replicate
incidents like the Hawaii false alarm in a disinformation campaign by
issuing false evacuation orders, issuing false nuclear alerts, or
subverting real ones via social media in order to cause mass confusion.

[During a crisis]{.underline} in the South China Sea or South Asia, for
example, [[when **tensions**]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark}
running [[high]{.underline},
[disinfor]{.underline}]{.mark}[mation]{.underline} campaigns [could
[have]{.mark} an [**outsized impact** on **crisis stability**]{.mark}
with]{.underline} potentially [severe **escalatory
consequences**]{.underline}. This [[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} would be
[[**compounded** when]{.underline} [decision makers]{.underline}]{.mark}
heavily [[rely on]{.underline}]{.mark} social
**[[media]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for]{.underline} information gathering
and [open-source intelligence]{.underline} [[and
are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus more [[susceptible to]{.mark}]{.underline}
social media **[[manipulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In an extreme
case, [a leader may]{.underline} come to [view]{.underline} social
[media as an]{.underline} [**accurate barometer** of public
sentiment]{.underline}, eschewing official evidence-based intelligence
sources, regardless of the origins of this virtual voice. As an example,
[in the [after]{.mark}math of [a **terrorist attack** in India]{.mark}'s
Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, [a disinfo]{.mark}rmation
[campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}---[conducted [by
terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline} to gain the support of the population
during insurgencies---[spread via social media amid a]{.underline}
heated national [election]{.underline}. [The resultant was]{.underline}
inflamed emotions and Indian domestic political [rhetoric that [led to
**military retaliation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against
Pakistan]{.underline}, [[bringing]{.underline}]{.mark} two
**[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**-armed [[adversaries close
to]{.mark}]{.underline} an inadvertent [[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}
[caused by **disinformation**]{.underline}, deception, and
misperception.

This crisis provides a sobering glimpse of how information and influence
campaigns between two nuclear-armed adversaries can affect crisis
stability and the concomitant risks of inadvertent escalation. As seen
in South Asia, the catalyzing [effect of]{.underline} costly signaling
and [**testing the limits** of an adversary's resolve]{.underline}
(which did not previously exist) to enhance security instead [increases
inadvertent **escalation risks**]{.underline} [and leaves both sides
**less secure.**]{.underline}

The effect of escalatory rhetoric in the information ecosystem can be a
double-edged sword for inadvertent escalation risk. On the one hand,
public rhetorical escalation can mobilize domestic support and signal
deterrence and resolve to an adversary, which makes war less likely. On
the other hand, [sowing public]{.underline} [fear]{.underline},
[creating **distrust**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the robustness of
[nuclear launch protocols]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [threatening a
rival leader's reputation]{.underline} as a strategic decision maker
[risk]{.underline} [escalating]{.underline} the **[likelihood of
war]{.underline}**. Domestic public disorder and confusion---caused, for
example, by a [[disinfo]{.mark}rmation campaign]{.underline} or
cyberattack---can [[act]{.mark} as an **[escalatory]{.mark} force**,
[putting]{.mark}]{.underline} [[decision]{.underline}
[makers]{.underline} [under **pressure**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
respond forcefully]{.underline} to foreign or domestic threats [[to
protect]{.underline}]{.mark} a state's
**[[legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, self-image, and credibility.
Ultimately, [states' willingness to engage in **[nuclear
brinkmanship]{.mark}**]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [[depend
on]{.underline}]{.mark} intelligence, mis- or
**[[disinfo]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}**, cognitive bias, and
perception of, and the value attached to, what is at stake.

As we look ahead, one cannot help but wonder if this threat of long-term
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** stagnation and [[**decline**
will]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[be the **catalyst** for **major
conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the future. For one, such [economic
[troubles]{.mark} could **[fuel]{.mark}**]{.underline} political
**[[radicalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[as]{.mark} it did [in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} 1920s and **[[1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At
the same time, [[rising]{.mark} levels of **protectionism** and
**[nationalism]{.mark}** could [lead to]{.mark} far worse [trade
disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} than we have seen in recent years,
[something that could]{.underline} also [turn an economic dispute into a
military conflict]{.underline}. Finally, [the [battle for **control**
of]{.mark} **strategic [resources]{.mark}** [such as oil]{.mark}, water,
land [or **rare-earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}
element**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[could **intensify**]{.mark}
**as**]{.underline} economic [**growth** slows, resulting in conflicts
over]{.underline} the control of these **[resources]{.underline}**.

[There are many examples of]{.underline} potential [[conflicts]{.mark}
between large]{.underline} economic [powers that [could
**erupt**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the years and decades ahead,
[**particularly** [if]{.mark}]{.underline} economic [[**growth**
continues to slow]{.underline}]{.mark} over the longer-term. For
example, tensions between the world's two superpowers, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**China**]{.underline}, [have risen]{.underline} steadily in recent
years, due in part to US concerns about China's rising economic and
military power. As [[there are]{.mark} a large number of
[**flashpoints** that could bring]{.mark} these two]{.underline} giant
[[powers into conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}
(**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, etc.),
[the likelihood of a superpower conflict is]{.underline} now
[greater]{.underline} than it has been at any time since the early
1980s.

[This is not the only potential great power conflict]{.underline} that
the world faces today. For example, [tensions between [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
**Russia**]{.mark} have]{.underline} [also been rising]{.underline} as
the latter seeks to regain some of the geopolitical importance and
influence that it lost in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet
Union. [The growing rivalry between **[China and India]{.mark}** is
another flashpoint that has the potential to **erupt**]{.underline} into
a conflict between two major economic powers, particularly [in light
of]{.underline} the [numerous border disputes]{.underline} between those
two Asian giants. In fact, [there are a number of]{.underline} potential
[[conflicts]{.mark} involving]{.underline} two or more [major economies
that [could **erupt**]{.mark} in the near-future]{.underline}, [any of
which would]{.underline} not only [be [influenced by **economic
factors**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but would also have a major impact on
the economies of the combatants, as well as on the global economy as a
whole.

**[Quantum\-\--1AC]{.underline}**

**Advantage 2 is [QUANTUM]{.underline}:**

**Quantum sensing is [nearest-term]{.underline} application reaching
[maturity]{.underline}, but leadership is [contested]{.underline} by

[In [**quantum sensing**, leadership is]{.mark} **closely
contested**]{.underline} according to participants and echoed in
existing literature on quantum. Some highly cited research suggests that
China has a marginal lead, while other recent research says that the
United States enjoys a comfortable lead over China.16 [Innovation
indicators on **research output**]{.underline} (see the section below)
[shows research in this technology is virtually [**neck and neck**.
Leadership]{.mark} in this field [is **crucial** for **near-term**
applications, as]{.mark} quantum [sensing tech]{.mark}nologies
[are]{.mark} among [the **most advanced**]{.mark}, with several [already
reaching **high**]{.mark} **levels of
[maturity]{.mark}**.1]{.underline}7 [These technologies are **already
making inroads** into various industrial applications, offering **higher
sensitivity** and **new capabilities** that classical sensors can't
match]{.underline}. In health care, they're enabling more precise
cardiac monitoring and advanced brain-machine interfaces.18 [The Chinese
military claims to be using]{.underline} these [sensors for **detecting
submarines** and other **hidden threats**]{.underline}.19 And in
materials science, this technology is improving the detection of defects
at an unprecedented level of detail.20

Overall, [[China's]{.mark} strategic [focus on **near-term**]{.mark}
**quantum** [tech]{.mark}nologies [enables it to lead in]{.mark}
technologies that are **closer to [market
readiness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some experts noted that by
prioritizing these immediate gains, China may be overlooking the future
potential that quantum computing holds---a technology that, despite its
current developmental challenges, promises to revolutionize sectors from
pharmaceuticals to finance. Indeed, the global quantum technology
ecosystem shows a clear hierarchy in the market sizes of the three
fields. Quantum computing dominates the landscape, estimated by McKinsey
to capture approximately 87 percent of the total quantum technology
market by 2040, while quantum communications is estimated to account for
around 7 percent and quantum sensing 6 percent.21

\[\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]\]

That said, betting on a small certainty today may be worth more than a
big gamble tomorrow because the benefits of quantum communications are
evident while the scale and payoff of quantum computing remain
uncertain.

How Does China Innovate in Quantum Technologies?

From our roundtable discussion, [several]{.underline} key
[themes]{.underline} emerged that help [explain why, [despite]{.mark}
the **[small size]{.mark}** of its industry, [China]{.mark}'s quantum
ecosystem consistently **[punches above its
weight]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

First, participants noted that [China's approach]{.underline} to quantum
prioritizes [[transforming innovations into **tangible
products**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They noted that, [[unlike the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[which often focuses on knowledge creation, China ensures that
innovations move seamlessly from the **lab** to the
**market**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the Chinese government plays a
**pivotal role** in linking **research institutions** with
**industry**]{.underline}. This connection is particularly evident in
places such as Hefei, where the Hefei National High-tech Industry
Development Zone acts as a conduit between academic research and
commercial applications. Within this zone, government initiatives are
focused on aligning scientific breakthroughs with industrial demands,
fostering collaborations between universities, research labs, and
private enterprises. This approach has proven especially effective in
quantum technology, with Hefei emerging as a central hub for quantum
enterprises.

A prime example of this successful integration is Quantum Avenue within
the Hefei National High-tech Industry Development Zone, which has become
a beacon of China's quantum technology industry. This specialized area
on Yefei Road is said to host around 20 quantum technology companies,
embodying the zone's role as a key incubator for quantum enterprises.23
The concentration of these firms in one location accelerates the
transition of quantum research from theory to application. Breakthrough
innovations from this street have included superconducting quantum
computing prototypes, millimeter wave chips, and the renowned Micius
satellite. It is also home to at least four of the nine leading quantum
start-ups: Ciqtek, Origin Quantum, Qasky, and QuantumCTek listed in
table 1. According to one expert we spoke to, the key to China's success
in developing an industrial quantum ecosystem in Hefei is its ties to a
strong university---indeed, its strongest university in quantum,
USTC---as a central anchor. This mirrors comments from quantum experts
in China; Pan Jianwei, who is often referred to as China's "father of
quantum" and is cofounder of QuantumCTek, has been reported to have
said, "With the active participation of leading enterprises and guidance
from the government, an industrial chain that covers the equipment,
network, safety, and standards of quantum communication has been
basically formed in China."24

Second, the discussion highlighted the speed at which China is advancing
in quantum technology. Participants pointed out that [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [currently approaches
quantum]{.underline} innovation [as a]{.underline} "Vannevar Bush
[science project" rather than as a **national security** or
**competitiveness** priority. This refers to]{.underline} the
[linear]{.underline} model of [innovation]{.underline}, often attributed
to Vannevar Bush, a key figure in the development of U.S. science
policy. In this model, basic research leads to applied research, which
then leads to development and eventually to commercial products. [It's a
step-by-step [process]{.mark} that can be [**slow** and
**disjointed**]{.mark}, with each stage]{.underline} often [handled by
different entities]{.underline} (e.g., universities for research,
companies for development). In contrast, [[China's approach is designed
for **speed**]{.mark} and **efficiency**]{.underline}. The country's
strategy centralizes efforts and streamlines the transition from
research to application. At the center of China's quantum research is
USTC, now the country's leading hub for QIS.25 This prominence largely
stems from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Key Laboratory of
Quantum Information, which was brought to USTC through the efforts of
Guo Guangcan, a renowned physicist and pivotal figure in QIS. Guo's
leadership secured this prestigious government lab for the university,
tightly integrating national research priorities with the university's
academic strengths. Since around 2017, China has increasingly
concentrated its quantum research efforts at USTC, particularly in
high-impact areas. This centralization has solidified USTC's position as
the driving force behind China's leadership in QIS.

Third, panelists highlighted China's centralized approach to funding
quantum research. Indeed, [the Chinese **[funding]{.mark} system** for
quantum [is **concentrated**]{.mark} and relies heavily on the National
Natural Science Foundation of China]{.underline}
(**[NSFC]{.underline}**). This organization is responsible for funding
around 50 percent of quantum publications in China across quantum
computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications.26 The [panelists
critiqued the comparative U.S. system]{.underline} for its "stovepiped"
funding mechanisms. [Funding sources]{.underline} in the United States
[are]{.underline} significantly [more diverse, with even the government
sources distributed across federal departments, which]{.underline}
according to participants [leads to **inefficiencies** and a **lack of
strategic coordination**, ultimately **slowing progress** and making it
harder for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to
compete with China's more unified approach]{.underline}. Relatedly, the
discussion highlighted China's readiness to fund high-risk quantum
start-ups, even at the risk of failure, while the United States remains
more cautious. As discussed in the previous section, [[China
invests]{.mark} boldly [in **ambitious projects** such as]{.mark}
quantum]{.underline} communication networks [[**prototypes**, aiming for
**tech**]{.mark}**nological [leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One
expert noted [this [willingness to **take risks** positions China to
achieve]{.mark} **significant [breakthroughs and]{.mark} potentially
[dominate quantum]{.mark} science**, while the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has taken a more **conservative
approach**]{.underline}, [focusing on more **theoretical
projects**]{.underline}.

**Quantum [sensor leadership]{.underline} determines who sets broader
[quantum standards]{.underline}. Leadership [now]{.underline} is key.**

[In today's escalating]{.underline} geopolitical [**competition** for
**technological supremacy**, [a critical race is unfolding]{.mark} at
the atomic level.]{.underline} By harnessing the unique behavior of
atoms, [[quantum]{.mark} tech]{.underline}nologies [have]{.underline}
the [potential to [transform]{.mark} how we measure, process, and
communicate information]{.underline}. Quantum computers---capable of
solving specific classes of problems orders of magnitude faster than
classical supercomputers---could both power molecular simulations that
accelerate the discovery of novel drugs and materials as well as break
the encryption protocols that safeguard the world's digital
infrastructure. At the same time, [quantum]{.underline} networks
[could]{.underline} interconnect quantum systems to [work]{.underline}
together [on **[complex tasks]{.mark}** as well as enable **ultrasecure
communications**]{.underline}.

[[If]{.mark} the promise of]{.underline} [quantum
[computing]{.mark}]{.underline} and networking [[remains **over the
horizon**]{.mark}, the [real-world]{.mark} applications of **quantum
[sensing]{.mark}** have [already arrived]{.mark}. By detecting **minute
changes** in atomic energy levels]{.underline}, these [[sensors achieve
unprecedented]{.mark} **sensitivity**, [**precision**, and]{.mark}
longterm **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[redefining how we
measure time and fundamental physical forces like gravity and
electromagnetism]{.underline}. Although this technology can transform
fields ranging from resource exploration to biomedical diagnostics,
[quantum sensing]{.underline} applications [[for positioning,
navigation, and timing]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[PNT]{.underline}**)
[are]{.underline} arguably [the most ubiquitous, applicable, and
**[critical to]{.mark} national [security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Atomic
clocks---the most mature quantum technology in use today---already power
the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) underpinning PNT services for
defense systems across land, sea, air, and space domains. GPS is also
the primary source of precision PNT for critical infrastructure,
including power grids, telecommunications networks, financial
transactions, and numerous sectors of the global economy.

The ubiquity of GPS applications makes GPS an appealing target for
geopolitical adversaries, creating serious national security
vulnerabilities. Conveniently for the attackers, GPS is both essential
to modern life and inherently susceptible to attacks. GPS satellites,
which transmit information through low-power radiofrequency (RF)
signals, are especially vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and physical
attacks. This is not a hypothetical---electronic warfare has been a
mainstay in ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East,
while recent analyses reveal America's adversaries are investing in
enhancing their antisatellite capabilities.8 Together, these
developments paint a sobering picture of the escalating risks to the
U.S. PNT infrastructure.

As nations grapple with the potentially catastrophic consequences of
losing reliable GPS signals, [quantum [sensors]{.mark} could mitigate
risks and [revolutionize]{.mark} PNT capabilities]{.underline} once
again. [Next-generation **atomic [clocks]{.mark}** and quantum
[**accelerometers**, **gyroscopes**, **gravimeters**, and
**magnetometers**]{.mark} can serve as local, trusted sources of
PNT]{.underline} that do not rely on vulnerable external signals.
Quantum sensors are poised not only to provide a reliable GPS backup but
also to potentially surpass current alternatives: Quantum can deliver
PNT that is more accurate, stable, and stealthy, even in contested
environments or where RF signals are naturally degraded. Moreover, they
promise to enable emerging technologies with stringent PNT requirements,
such as sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks.

[[In advancing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [deployment of quantum [sensors,
the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has]{.mark} a **strategic
[opportunity]{.mark}** [to address]{.mark}]{.underline} pressing GPS
vulnerabilities while reinforcing [[its global **quantum**]{.mark}
**technology [leadership]{.mark}**. The [returns on investment could be
far-reaching, creating]{.mark} significant [benefits for **defense**,
**economic resilience**, and **geopolitical competition**.
Enhanced]{.mark} quantum [sensors will]{.mark} not only secure PNT for
**warfighters**, **critical infrastructure**, and the broader
**commercial sector**, but also [drive **innovation**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} less obvious but [[equally important
applications]{.mark}. Quantum sensors']{.underline} capacity for
superior measurement [can]{.underline} also [help detect
hidden]{.underline} adversary tunnels and **[submarines]{.underline}**,
advance security inspections of computer chips, enable portable
biomedical diagnostics, and even unravel the mysteries of dark matter.9
Moreover, [advances in **shared supply chains** and
**engineering**]{.underline}---[such as **hardening** quantum
sensors]{.underline} against environmental interference [and further
**miniaturizing** their components]{.underline}---[will likely
**catalyze breakthroughs** [in other]{.mark} emerging
[fields]{.mark}]{.underline} facing similar technical bottlenecks,
[[from quantum **computing** and **networking** to]{.mark} advanced
[**semiconductors** and **biotech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline}.

[[As]{.mark} global [competition for quantum leadership intensifies, so
does]{.mark} the [urgency]{.mark} that t[he
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark} its [efforts in the strategic field of
[quantum sensing. For decades, the]{.mark}]{.underline} People's
Republic of China (**[[PRC]{.underline}]{.mark}**)---[America's closest
**quantum competitor**]{.underline}---[[has]{.mark} **consistently**
made quantum technologies a **strategic priority**, on par
with]{.underline} artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) [and
**semiconductors**]{.underline}. [Through aggressive investments and
government-driven initiatives, [China is **rapidly advancing**]{.mark}
its quantum capabilities, [with]{.mark} the [potential to
**reshape**]{.mark} **international [standards]{.mark}** [and
secure]{.mark} a **[competitive edge]{.mark}** in both defense and
economic innovation. The [stakes are]{.mark} high: Maintaining U.S.
[quantum leadership is essential]{.mark} not only [for **national
security**]{.mark} but [also]{.mark} for [preserving]{.mark} the
**[tech]{.mark}nological** [and **economic advantages**]{.mark} that
underpin America's **global influence**]{.underline}.

[Although [the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [currently leads the
world]{.underline} in quantum PNT, [it [cannot take]{.mark} its [lead
for granted]{.mark}]{.underline}. Decades of federal research and
development (R&D) funding have positioned U.S. universities and federal
labs at the forefront of high-impact research on advanced atomic clocks
and quantum navigation sensors. [A growing ecosystem of U.S.
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}, many founded by scientists produced by
these same research institutions, [[have]{.mark} developed and
[demonstrated]{.mark} **integrated [prototypes]{.mark}** aboard U.S.
military platforms, [with some]{.mark} solutions **[starting to
reach]{.mark} the [market]{.mark}**[. However]{.mark}, significant
[challenges persist. Many]{.mark} quantum [sensors remain stuck]{.mark}
in the research and prototype stages]{.underline}, and even those
already on the market need to be made more robust to harsh environments
and reduced in size, weight and power (SWaP) consumption and cost.
Supply chain vulnerabilities, limited access to specialized fabrication
facilities, and low private investment exacerbate these technical
challenges, hindering the transition of laboratory breakthroughs to
production and large-scale manufacturing.

[[Despite]{.mark} formidable [challenges, **progress is within
reach**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [With sustained]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
decisive [leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} from the U.S. government in
partnership with industry and academia, [[quantum sensors could be
**matured** and **adopted**]{.mark} for]{.underline} PNT in military
missions and [critical infrastructure **[within a few years]{.mark}**.
Failure to act risks relegating the world's most capable sensors to the
"Valley of Death," where innovations falter]{.underline} during the
transition from lab to market. [Ultimately, [**policy inaction** would
squander a **unique opportunity** to harness]{.mark} America's [quantum

vulnerabilities, strengthen the resilience of our fighting forces and

Geopolitical Risks of a Quantum Computing Gap ("Q-Day" Ahead)

What happens if one nation succeeds in building a fault-tolerant,
cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) significantly ahead
of others? This scenario -- [[one]{.mark} country [leaping]{.mark}
to]{.underline} a **[powerful quantum]{.underline}** capability
[[first]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} often painted
in geopolitics as [[a]{.mark} **potential [earthquake]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the global [balance of power]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's
worth examining the risks and implications of such a quantum gap
emerging.

Intelligence and National Security Upheaval

[The most **immediate risk** is to encrypted information. A CRQC can
break]{.underline} common public-key
**[[cryptosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}** (like RSA and ECC) [that
[secure everything from **military comm**]{.mark}**unication[s]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} **online [banking]{.mark}**[. If Country
X]{.mark}]{.underline} alone possesses a CRQC, it
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[decrypt]{.mark} the secret
[comm]{.mark}unication[s of other states]{.mark} at will. This would
render an **enormous intelligence advantage**]{.underline} --
essentially, [[Country X could read]{.mark}]{.underline} diplomatic
[[**cables**, **military orders**, confidential]{.mark} **business
[transactions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, etc., [of any
adversary]{.underline} still using vulnerable encryption. The result
would be a one-sided transparency: the leading state sees everyone
else's secrets, but its own remain secure (assuming it has transitioned
to quantum-proof encryption internally). This asymmetry is
destabilizing. [[It could encourage]{.mark} the leading power [to
be]{.mark} **more [aggressive]{.mark}** [since it holds]{.mark} an
**[info]{.mark}rmational [high ground]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} conversely
[induce **paranoia** and **desperation** in others]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In a conflict, one side's secure networks might go dark as their codes
get broken, potentially leading to swift victory for the quantum power.
[[Even in peace]{.mark}time]{.underline}, the
**[espionage]{.underline}** windfall [could shift economic and political
leverage]{.underline} -- [[imagine deciphering]{.mark} another nation's
**trade strategies** or uncovering **[blackmail]{.mark}**-worthy info
[on]{.mark} its **[leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Moreover, this risk isn't just theoretical for the future; it casts a
shadow on the present. The fear of a sudden "Q-Day" (quantum day)
arriving has already prompted major powers to stockpile encrypted data
(to decrypt later) and to rush the deployment of post-quantum
cryptography. There's an erosion of trust: even now, some governments
worry that their communications might eventually be exposed if a rival
is first to CRQC. So, [[the]{.mark} mere [prospect]{.mark}]{.underline}
of one nation getting there first [introduces suspicion and [could lead
to]{.mark} a kind of [pre-emptive **cyber cold
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, where everyone accelerates cyber defenses
and possibly even considers more drastic measures (like limiting what
information is sent electronically at all).

Strategic Instability and Arms Race Dynamics

[A quantum]{.underline} computing [breakthrough has been **[likened
to]{.mark}** the advent of **[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} terms of **[disruptive impact]{.mark}**. If one country
achieves it, others might]{.underline} feel strategically
[**blackmailed** or **vulnerable**]{.underline}, somewhat like how the
U.S. nuclear monopoly in 1945-49 made the Soviet Union feel an
existential urgency to get the bomb. [[We could see frantic
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} by others [[to catch
up]{.underline}]{.mark} -- pouring resources into crash programs
[[or]{.mark} even]{.underline} engaging in **[[risky
espionage]{.underline}]{.mark}**/sabotage to slow the leader down. [The
competition could take on [an **arms-race intensity**, straining
relations]{.mark} and [diverting]{.mark} huge [funds into]{.mark}
**quantum [militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some analysts even
speculate about a quantum deterrence concept: if both sides have CRQCs,
maybe they reach a new balance (akin to mutual assured destruction in
nukes, except here "mutual assured decryption" -- both can read each
other's secrets, so maybe neither trusts the other, a strange
equilibrium). [But the transition period]{.underline} where one has it
and others don't [is perilous. It might tempt the leader to press its
advantage]{.underline} (before others obtain the tech or switch to
quantum-safe encryption, which could take years globally). [[This could
**escalate conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conversely, [others might
take drastic steps]{.underline} to prevent falling too far behind --
maybe [forming coalitions]{.underline} to pool quantum efforts or, in
extreme dystopian scenarios, [[launching **pre-emptive
strikes**]{.underline}]{.mark} on facilities if they believed a rival's
CRQC would completely neutralize their defense. While such military
action is unlikely, it illustrates how destabilizing a big gap could be
perceived.

Erosion of Privacy, Commerce, and Public Trust

If a state actor can break all encryption, it's not just governments at
risk---[**corporate** and **personal [data]{.mark}** [worldwide could be
**breached**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Financial systems rely on encryption;
a CRQC could potentially crack cryptocurrency keys (undermining
blockchain-based currencies and systems) or breach bank security. [The
leading nation could]{.underline} theoretically [**manipulate financial
markets** or **steal intellectual property**]{.underline} en masse,
boosting its companies while sabotaging competitors. This undermines the
global economic playing field. Additionally, [general public trust in
digital systems could plummet]{.underline}. If people believe that
nothing encrypted is safe anymore and that Big Brother (somewhere) can
listen in, it could disrupt e-commerce, digital communications usage,
and lead to calls for new communication paradigms (perhaps a resurgence
of analog or offline methods for sensitive info). In liberal
democracies, if an adversary nation had this power, citizens might
demand their governments take action or decouple networks to protect
data. If a less liberal actor got it first, concerns about mass
surveillance beyond their borders rise -- for instance, activists,
journalists, or companies worldwide might be spied upon without their
knowledge.

Technological Hegemony and Dependency

Beyond cryptography, [a nation]{.underline} far ahead in quantum
computing [might **achieve breakthroughs** in **optimization**,
**machine learning**, **material science**, etc., that others cannot
match. This could yield **[tech]{.mark}nological [hegemony]{.mark}**:
the leader's industries might suddenly have **superior
products**]{.underline} (drugs discovered via quantum simulations, more
efficient batteries or materials, etc.) [[that give]{.mark} it
**[economic dominance]{.mark}**. Other countries could become
dependent]{.underline} on the leader's quantum services or findings. For
example, if advanced quantum computers are only available in one
country's cloud, others might have no choice but to access them through
that country's companies, essentially paying and relying on a foreign
power's goodwill for critical computing needs. [This [is a]{.mark}n
**uncomfortable [sovereignty]{.mark}** [issue]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
discussed earlier. The risk is a widening techno-economic gap -- the
rich-get-richer scenario where the first mover soaks up investment,
talent, patents and the laggards find it hard to ever catch up (much
like how a few countries dominate aerospace or supercomputing now, but
potentially more extreme).

Global Tensions and Alliances Shifts

If one nation is close to a big quantum lead, [[it could realign]{.mark}
global [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}. Allies of that country may feel
more secure (bandwagoning with the strong horse), while adversaries band
together for mutual protection. We might see new coalitions centered on
quantum tech -- for instance, countries that fear the leader might unify
to create alternative quantum infrastructures (like a separate quantum
communication network where the leader state is excluded, or joint
research centers to collectively catch up). [Neutral [countries]{.mark}
could be [pressured to choose]{.mark} sides]{.underline} in subtle ways,
like aligning with the quantum leader to get access to the tech or
aligning with a rival bloc pushing for an international treaty or norms
to limit quantum espionage. Indeed, one could imagine calls in the UN
for some kind of "Quantum Non-Proliferation Treaty" or an agreement not
to use quantum computers to violate other countries' encryption.
However, enforcement would be tricky (it's hard to verify if someone is
secretly using a quantum computer for code-breaking, since it could be
done behind closed doors by an intelligence agency).

In all, the prospect of one nation achieving a CRQC far ahead of others
is viewed with grave concern in policy circles, which is why there's
such emphasis on post-quantum cryptography migration now, and on
ensuring no single adversary "wins the quantum race." Many [[experts
urge]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark} treat
cryptographic vulnerability as an impending crisis and [[act
proactively: the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} National Security Agency and
NIST are pushing rapid adoption of quantum-resistant encryption
algorithms, and similarly, [[European and Chinese **standards bodies**
are looking]{.mark} at]{.underline} new [encryption]{.underline} to
blunt the advantage of any single actor developing a CRQC. This is
essentially risk mitigation: even if one country gets a big quantum
computer, if the world's data has mostly moved to quantum-proof
encryption, the impact (at least on communications security) is greatly
reduced.

Nevertheless, some unpredictability remains. Unlike nuclear weapons,
which produce observable blasts and thus announce their use, a nation
could conceivably keep a CRQC secret for some time, quietly gathering
intel. The unknown factor ("Has someone already built one and not told
us?") makes the geopolitical environment even more anxious -- though
experts believe we would probably know from scientific publications if a
true fault-tolerant quantum computer was achieved, it might not be
immediately obvious if it's held under wraps.

In conclusion, [a major quantum]{.underline} computing [gap poses
risks]{.underline} of espionage supremacy, strategic imbalance, and
economic upheaval. [[It's a scenario everyone wants to
avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [either [by racing so]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[no one is left **too**]{.mark} **far [behind]{.mark}**[,
or]{.mark} by **[cooperative measures]{.mark}**]{.underline} (technology
[[**sharing** among allies, **global standards**]{.underline}]{.mark}
for security) [[to minimize]{.mark} the [fallout]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As in the Cold War nuclear situation, the ideal end state might be one
where multiple powers each have quantum capabilities and thus a kind of
deterrence or balance emerges, albeit at the cost of a new status quo
where much effort goes into counter-intelligence and defense. But
[[getting]{.mark} to]{.underline} that [[equilibrium without]{.mark} a
destabilizing "**[first strike]{.mark}**" advantage period [is the
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} that worries strategists today.

[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} undermine encryption standards and
[[accelerate]{.mark} the **[global]{.mark} spread**]{.underline} [of

Data-Centric Authoritarianism: How China's Development of Frontier

technologies, including quantum, artificial intelligence (AI), and
digital currencies, are solidifying Beijing's tech-enabled governance
model while influencing authoritarian regimes worldwide.

The analysts suggest that China's [[quantum]{.mark}

**[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly [[through]{.mark}
the potential [to break]{.mark}]{.underline} [**conventional

Data Security Under Threat

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[dedicated]{.mark}
substantial]{.underline} [resources [to **quantum**]{.mark}
**research**]{.underline}, arguably [[**outpacing** U.S.]{.mark}
government]{.underline} [[funding]{.mark} in **key areas**]{.underline}

[China's investment]{.underline} in quantum technology [is times
**greater** than the U.S. planned government spending]{.underline} as of
2023. Researchers at China's Hefei National Laboratory for Physical
Sciences, alongside firms such as Origin Quantum and QuantumCTek, are
leading efforts to build quantum processors and secure communication
networks.

[A major concern]{.underline} raised in the report [is the "**harvest
now, decrypt later**]{.underline}" [strategy]{.underline}, [where
encrypted data is stored today with]{.underline} the
[expectation]{.underline} [that future]{.underline} [quantum
computers]{.underline} [will]{.underline} be able to [crack
it]{.underline}. Current encryption relies on mathematical problems that
classical computers cannot solve efficiently, but quantum systems
capable of running Shor's algorithm could theoretically break these
protections.

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been
working on post-quantum cryptography to counteract this threat, but the
transition remains in early stages. The report emphasizes the urgency
for civil society groups, journalists and human rights organizations to
adopt quantum-resistant cryptographic methods before adversaries gain
decryption capabilities.

Quantum Communications: Security or Control?

Beyond decryption, [China is leveraging quantum]{.underline}
[technologies]{.underline} [for **secure communications**]{.underline},
deploying a national quantum network and operating the Mozi satellite,
which reportedly facilitates space-to-ground quantum key distribution
(QKD). The report highlights that China has conducted quantum
communications tests with Russia and is exploring expanding this network
among BRICS nations, which now include Brazil, Russia, India, China,
South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.

While QKD promises theoretically unbreakable encryption, the report
warns of potential vulnerabilities.

"First, [[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} [computing]{.underline} is
[expected]{.underline} [to]{.underline} eventually [enable
any]{.underline} state or non-state [actor that possesses]{.underline}
this technology [to [circumvent encryption]{.mark}]{.underline} [that
**protects communications**]{.underline}," the analysts state. "Second,
[[if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[quantum
communications]{.underline}]{.mark} providers [[who are
**first-movers**]{.underline} in]{.mark} this space [[adopt]{.mark}
cryptography [standards]{.mark}]{.underline} and equipment [[that

be **vulnerable** to **state surveillance**]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
potentially either [by]{.underline} [the governments that import these
technologies]{.underline}, or by the home countries of companies that
provide quantum services."

Democratic nations have taken steps to mitigate China's dominance in
quantum communications. The European Union launched the EuroQCI
initiative, and the U.S. has ramped up funding for quantum networking
research. Still, [[China's lead]{.underline}]{.mark} in quantum-secure

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} [advances in [quantum]{.mark}
technology]{.underline} [[intersect]{.underline}
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} its [**[AI]{.mark}-powered
[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline} infrastructure. The report
describes AI-powered "city brains" in smart cities, which integrate
[data from facial recognition, social media, and public]{.underline}
[records]{.underline} to [automate law enforcement
decision-making]{.underline}. It also highlights the role of PRC
companies like CloudWalk, Megvii, and SenseTime in developing AI systems
optimized for tracking and monitoring populations.

[Quantum computing]{.underline} could [enhance]{.underline} [these
systems by]{.underline} [accelerating]{.underline} the [processing of
vast]{.underline} amounts of [surveillance data]{.underline}.

The report states: "Notably, Chinese tech platform Origin Quantum states
on its website that its quantum computing technology can aid with speech
and image recognition and processing as well as pattern matching more
broadly, underscoring the potential symbiotic relationship between
quantum computing and AI-powered surveillance."

As quantum technology matures, it could be used to refine AI-driven
predictions of political dissent or protests, further reducing the time
window for civic movements to organize before authorities intervene.

Digital Currencies and Financial Surveillance

China's digital yuan, or e-CNY, represents another facet of data-driven
governance with geopolitical implications. While adoption within China
has been slower than anticipated, the report notes that China is pushing
cross-border digital currency transactions through the mBridge project,
a blockchain-based settlement system that includes financial
institutions from Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and the UAE.

Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs) provide governments with direct control over
transactions.

Direct links between central banks and individuals, governments can
immediately access and monitor user data, rather than requesting it from
third-party financial intermediaries, according to the report.

For authoritarian regimes, **[CBDCs]{.underline}** [present an
opportunity to enhance **financial surveillance**]{.underline} and
restrict opposition funding. The spread of China's [digital yuan
could]{.underline} also [**undermine** the effectiveness of **U.S.
financial sanctions**]{.underline}, particularly against Russia and
Iran, by reducing reliance on SWIFT, the dominant international banking
messaging system.

Geopolitical and Industry Response

The U.S. and its allies have taken steps to counterbalance China's
technological influence. The CHIPS Act, enacted in 2022, provides
funding for quantum research. The Senate is beginning debate on a \$2.5
billion bill to bolster quantum efforts. Another strategy is focused on
export controls have been imposed on quantum-related technologies.
However, the NED report suggests that export controls alone may not be
sufficient to prevent China from shaping global standards in quantum
cryptography, AI surveillance, and digital currencies.

The [report calls for [democratic]{.mark} governments]{.underline} [to
engage]{.underline} [in]{.underline} **[international
[standard-setting]{.mark}]{.underline}** fora [to [prevent
authoritarian]{.mark} digital [norms]{.mark}]{.underline} from
[[becoming the **default**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It also
[recommends]{.underline} [**accelerating efforts** to]{.underline}
[implement **post-quantum cryptography**]{.underline}, fostering
privacy-preserving technologies, and tracking the diffusion of China's
surveillance infrastructure.

The Future of Data-Centric Authoritarianism

The report presents a stark picture of how China is using quantum and
other frontier [technologies to **cement** its model of
governance,]{.underline} both domestically and [abroad]{.underline}. It
argues that, **[without countermeasures]{.underline}**, [democratic
institutions risk being **outpaced** by an ecosystem
designed]{.underline} [for **data-driven control.**]{.underline}

The analysts conclude: "The rapid and complex [[tech]{.mark}nological
[transition]{.mark}]{.underline} we are witnessing
[[suits]{.underline}]{.mark} authoritarian regimes, and
**[[Beijing]{.mark} in particular]{.underline}**. It
[presents]{.underline} a **[window of opportunity]{.underline}** [not
only [to]{.mark} **challenge** the technological edge of democratic
states, but also]{.underline} to **[[weaken]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[established [rights to **privacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, anonymity, and
freedom of expression and assembly. The [[danger]{.mark} of data-driven
authoritarianism [can **only be mitigated**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[if
democracies]{.underline}]{.mark} recognize the centrality of data in
today's governance systems and work consciously to [[present an
**alternative**]{.underline}]{.mark} to authoritarian approaches. [It is
high time]{.underline} that [democratic societies **double down** on
building data]{.underline} and technological [ecosystems that are
**transparent**]{.underline}, accountable, [and **infused** [with
**democratic values**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Leveraging their robust
innovation ecosystems in tandem with the power of vibrant, pluralistic
civil societies, [democracies must chart a **rights-respecting path** to
unlock]{.underline} the [**benefits** of emerging
technologies]{.underline} for people **[around the
globe]{.underline}**."

**It's [existential]{.underline}.**

Brittle Legitimacy

[Reliance on information]{.underline} [control]{.underline}
[makes]{.underline} [[authoritarians]{.mark} **brittle**.]{.underline}
Small chinks in their information control armor [could [have
**existential consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[particularly]{.underline} [during **political**]{.underline} [or
**economic crises**]{.underline} (i.e. when the regime needs to rely on
control for legitimacy because it is not delivering for citizens). The
information and ideas most dangerous to authoritarians include:

the identity of opposition groups and leaders and their levels of
support; 17

technical means for subverting control of communications and
surveillance technologies;18

ideas about values that transcend state sovereignty, such as liberalism
and human rights;19

evidence that the central government is not delivering efficient
outcomes;20 and

ideas that undermine the myths and narratives used to legitimize
authoritarian rule or the power of the ruling elite.21

Constant Contest

Since technologies and ideas are dynamic, [[the battle for
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} [control [is]{.mark} a **[constant
struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It can never be 'won.'
[[Authoritarians]{.underline}]{.mark} [are]{.underline} therefore [in a
perpetual state of **information warfare**]{.underline}, inside and
outside their regime, [and [feel **perpetually
insecure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This dynamic may [lead]{.underline}
[authoritarian]{.underline} [governments to assess]{.underline} [that it
is worth engaging in]{.underline} information or
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}** to discredit liberal ideas at their
foreign source or to shape or disable systems [that]{.underline}
[jeopardize]{.underline} their [information
control]{.underline}---despite real [risks]{.underline} of [**conflict
escalation** and **global pushback.**]{.underline}

Overreach and Backlash

The fundamental importance of [[info]{.mark}rmation
[control]{.mark}]{.underline} to authoritarians [[increases]{.mark} the
[likelihood of **overreach**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [leading
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [cycles of **[backlash]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and reprisal. Many perceive China's heavy-handed narrative warfare in
Hong Kong and confrontational efforts to control narratives about
coronavirus to be strategic missteps. For example, CCP efforts to stifle
dissent by punishing online gaming company Blizzard and the National
Basketball Association (NBA) arguably aided Hong Kong protester
narratives;22 while [CCP]{.underline} **[obfuscation]{.underline}**
[about **coronavirus** has prompted unprecedented]{.underline}
[diplomatic rebukes]{.underline} from world leaders.23 Despite rising
international awareness and condemnation of China's sharp power
tactics,24 China is accelerating, not muting, these behaviors.25 One
explanation for this is that [the CCP]{.underline}
[calculates]{.underline} [that the **risks** of **international
backlash**]{.underline} (and occasional overreach by its officials) [are
**acceptable**]{.underline}, [compared]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
the [risk of letting]{.underline} [domestic information control
**falter**]{.underline}.

Impaired Feedback Mechanisms

Authoritarians embrace technology to increase the legibility of their
societies. But legibility requires cooperation from society. It is
facilitated by an open information ecosystem, robust civil society,
mechanisms of transparency, and protections for political speech.26
Conversely, [information control and
[tech]{.mark}nology-[enabled]{.mark} systems]{.underline} [of
**[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline} and enforcement
[[discourage]{.underline}]{.mark} accurate
[[reporting]{.underline}]{.mark} and punish whistleblowing, while
[incentivizing officials [to **conceal failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and exaggerate successes.27 In 2007, Le Keqiang (before he became
China's premier) described China's national income figures as "man-made"
and unreliable, and noted that more objectively verifiable proxies
should be preferred to official statistics collected by provinces.28
Without elections, authoritarians can also struggle to understand public
sentiment, a problem highlighted by the Chinese government's
mismanagement of massive ongoing protests in Hong Kong. Party leaders
wrongly assessed that the protestors' grievances were primarily economic
rather than political and that they did not enjoy broader public
support.29 As Zeynep Tufekci has observed, the [[costs]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} China's ["[authoritarian]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[[ignorance]{.underline}]{.mark}\] ~~blindness~~" have been immense: a
solvable issue (demands to withdraw a relatively unimportant extradition
treaty) [became]{.underline} "[[a bigger]{.mark}, **durable
[crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [with ongoing political
consequences]{.underline}.30

[China's]{.underline} [delayed reaction]{.underline} [to
coronavirus]{.underline} [is a stark example]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the [authoritarian legibility]{.underline} and feedback
problem. Local officials and hospital administrators in Wuhan suppressed
information about the outbreak and punished doctor
whistleblowers---depriving other provinces and the central government
(not to mention international authorities) of vital signals that would
have allowed swifter action to control the pandemic.31 Once authorities
acknowledged the pandemic, China deployed the full weight of its digital
surveillance capabilities. It was able to implement top-down lockdowns
quickly; marshal its tech sector to build health apps; force citizens to
download these apps; and access vast commercial holdings of personal
data to cross-check compliance. However, it lacked critical bottom-up
feedback systems that may have obviated the need for such draconian
measures in the first place.32 Indeed, controlling for income and
population size, [authoritarian regimes appear]{.underline} to be
[**more lethal** than democracies during **epidemics**]{.underline},
arguably [because of]{.underline} their [**closed information**
ecosystems.33]{.underline}

Overreliance on Technological Systems which 'Fail Hard'

Many [authoritarian governments]{.underline} are [embracing
AI-]{.underline}driven [**surveillance** and control]{.underline}
[methods]{.underline}---from 'smart cities' to digital currencies,
e-payment platforms and social apps. However, [when]{.underline} [AI
systems fail]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} tend to [fail in
**unpredictable**]{.underline}, often **[catastrophic
ways]{.underline}**. While citizens in democracies lament slow adoption
of digital governance, authoritarians' speed comes with the risk that
[authorities]{.underline} [roll out unsafe or **vulnerable
systems**]{.underline}.34 Imagine a [critical failure of
China's]{.underline} [social credit system]{.underline}---whether by
accident or sabotage---which affected the integrity of records. The
[implications for **regime stability** could be
**significant**]{.underline}.

AI systems do not need to fail to produce problematic results. They draw
insights and make predictions based on correlations in vast datasets but
are not good at identifying causal mechanisms. This means that AI
systems often produce outcomes which humans cannot reverse engineer or
routinely evaluate. Like using asbestos to build a city, [AI
governance]{.underline} systems might produce good results in the
short-term, but [[inconsistencies]{.underline}]{.mark} or oversights
[in]{.underline} their [approaches]{.underline} could [[lead to
**cascading failures**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that humans]{.underline}
[struggle to]{.underline} identify, let alone [rectify]{.underline}.35

Unintended Consequences from High-Tech Modernism

Fixation by central governments on achieving targets or deploying
certain technologies creates incentives for local officials to deploy
"technology placebos" that do little to address underlying economic and
social concerns. For example, many so-called smart city projects in
authoritarian societies have failed to meet development and economic
goals. They are fraught with issues such as "unclear strategic goals"
(e.g. they often optimize for surveillance, not development) and
"inadequate implementation."36 This problem may be particularly
pronounced for less-developed authoritarian governments which have been
persuaded, for strategic reasons, to buy Chinese-exported digital
surveillance tools that are not customized to local circumstances. These
cities may also become locked into unstable or insecure technical
architectures37 and economic dependence on China.38

Commitments to targets, and ideological fervor about technology, can
also distort commercial decisions and raise unrealistic public
expectations. Analysis of China's AI industry, for example, suggests
that companies are eschewing investment in basic research and focusing
on quick wins in applied research.39 Additionally, China is already
behind on meeting a number of its technology targets40---a lag that will
likely be exacerbated by the global economic downturn following the
coronavirus pandemic, and rising security fears in foreign markets about
the security of Chinese technology and IP theft by its companies.

From a strategic perspective, [there are risks]{.underline} that
[authoritarian governments' fixation on technology-centric strategies
will lead them to **overestimate** what technology can]{.underline} in
fact [achieve]{.underline}. For example, [Chinese military
strategists]{.underline} have [posited]{.underline} [that
AI]{.underline} [could]{.underline} [lift the '**fog' of
war**]{.underline} [and **eliminate uncertainty**]{.underline} and
confusion on the battlef ield. [[This]{.mark} is]{.underline} an
**[ahistorical]{.underline}** [and **unlikely prediction**]{.underline}
[that [could inspire **miscalculation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.41 Russian
strategists theorize about how psychological operations might subdue
adversaries without a shot being fired---an approach that may
overestimate what cognitive warfare can achieve, at least without being
combined with other elements of national power.42

[[Quantum]{.mark} computing]{.underline}, a revolutionary field of

computers**]{.underline}. They can, for instance, simulate molecular
interactions with unprecedented accuracy, facilitating the design of new
drugs, catalysts, and materials with desired properties. This can
accelerate research and development, leading to faster and more
efficient drug discovery processes.

[However, alongside remarkable possibilities, there are **burgeoning
[concerns]{.mark}** about the possible **[unintended
consequences]{.mark}** that can arise [from]{.mark} this [**step
change** in computing power]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
[[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} computing poses an immense potential in
cybersecurity and cryptography, it [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[**[break existing encryption]{.mark}** algorithms, [posing]{.mark} a
[threat to]{.mark} traditional **security systems** and creating new

data**, **critical infrastructure**, and]{.mark} **global
[communication]{.mark}** networks. The potential for widespread
**disruption** and **chaos** underscores the urgent need]{.underline} to
develop quantum-resistant cryptography and strengthen overall
cybersecurity defences.

Furthermore, the [advancements in [quantum-powered

**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [[could outpace]{.mark} the
development of **[ethical]{.mark} frameworks** and [**governance**.

An added sense of [[urgency comes from]{.underline}]{.mark} the recent
take off in **[generative [AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**, set to transform
the world, [amid [warnings about]{.mark}]{.underline} its capacity for
harm to the point of **[human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[There is a **[similar]{.mark}** narrative [to **quantum
tech**]{.mark}**nologies**]{.underline}. They are currently only making
a difference at the margin in, for instance, optimising supply chains or
the preventive maintenance of machines. However, [as the
science]{.underline} advances, and an estimated \$36bn in investments
from governments, plus the private sector piles in, [the probability of
**[radical breakthroughs]{.mark}** rises]{.underline}.

These range from **[[quantum]{.mark} computers]{.underline}** that
[[could **break encryption**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the issue that
gathers the most column inches -- [to **quantum sensors**]{.underline}
that might detect, say, the UK's Trident Submarine armed with its
nuclear weapons.

One of the most interesting aspects of quantum is the cross over between
military and civilian uses -- quantum sensors for situational awareness
use the same technology as those used for medical diagnosis, for
instance making them profitable on various fronts. Four industries
(automotive, chemicals, financial services and life sciences) are likely
to see the earliest impact from quantum computing with gains of up to
\$1.3 trillion in value by 2035,when the industry is expected to reach
maturity, according to McKinsey.

This harks back to the civilian benefits accruing from DARPA, the US
defence think tank which originally invented the internet mainly so that
satellites could communicate. [We are only]{.underline} at the
[starting]{.underline} line [in understanding how quantum]{.underline}
technologies [will]{.underline} be used to **[change the
world]{.underline}**.

[What is clear is that [**NATO** and]{.mark} its [partners **need to
focus**]{.mark}]{.underline} on four areas in their bid to maintain
advantage.

Firstly, support the commercial ventures which are driving development.
In the US, around \$4bn of public money (excluding classified military
investments) is going into quantum, and a close equivalent of \$3.7bn in
private funding, while there are over 310 startups, as well as blue chip
behemoths like Google and IBM involved.

[Focus [on **near-wins** to help **propagate quantum literacy**, as well
as **encourage funding**]{.mark} of the industry. [**Quantum sensing**
is among]{.mark} the **[most promising]{.mark}**
technologies]{.underline}, with companies from Bosch to Multiverse
Computing working [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**hardware** and
**software**]{.underline}]{.mark}, respectively. The September 22
[[bombing of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Nord Stream]{.underline}]{.mark}
gas pipelines [[is a]{.mark} clear [user case]{.mark}: our [**current
sensors** do not have]{.mark} the [capacity]{.mark} to detect a
coin-sized hole]{.underline} through which gas escapes from 5km away.
[Quantum sensors are likely to be able to once further
developed]{.underline}, while also being an independent back up for GPS.
[Our [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, including smart phones,
[[is]{.mark} dependent on]{.underline} the global navigation [satellite
systems and [therefore]{.mark} rendered
**[vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Keep clarity on regulation. The National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) in the US is developing a framework for quantum
cybersecurity standards, due out in 2024. Regulation from bodies like
this one, or the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), are
the only way to force firms to invest in quantum risk reduction because
many currently baulk at spending funds and management time when they
lack a sense of urgency.

Lastly, use [[NATO's soft power]{.underline}]{.mark} to [**[bolster
cooperation]{.mark}** among friendly nations, be it [through helping
finance]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[consortiums]{.mark} in
quantum [or simply]{.mark}]{.underline} using its
[[convening]{.underline}]{.mark} powers to bring [together
[participants. The Alliance has a crucial]{.mark}, **unifying
[role]{.mark}** [to play]{.mark}]{.underline} in an era of national
industrial competition, with export controls harming allied members as
well as enemy countries.

You can't plan an epiphany, but that is exactly what we have had in AI.
[We must be better prepared [for a **quantum leap**]{.mark}, and NATO
has a **key role to play**]{.underline}.

**The plan's [early adoption]{.underline} via cables enables

start-ups drive the quantum industry, while Germany's and Japan's

merely]{.underline} a matter of [retaining]{.underline} a competitive
[edge in the Arctic; i[t is a **necessity**]{.mark} to fortify against
attempts to undermine]{.underline} regional [**stability** and
**security**. [By spearheading]{.mark}]{.underline} the development and

[The]{.underline} European [[Arctic is no longer]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[quiet]{.underline}]{.mark} theater of 'High North, [low
tension]{.underline}.' [Russian and Chinese]{.underline} commercial and
research [[vessels have begun]{.mark} to conduct deniable **[disruption

**[dragging]{.mark} an [anchor]{.mark}** across the seabed]{.underline}.
Notable [incidents include]{.underline} cable [disruptions between
**Svalbard** and **Norway**]{.underline} in 2021 [and]{.underline}
between [**Finland** and **Estonia**]{.underline} in 2023.
[Although]{.underline} the [intentions]{.underline} of China and Russia
[remain unclear, their hybrid [operations]{.mark} clearly **[pose a
threat to regional security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With the demand for
expanded connectivity across the Arctic, physical and cyber intrusions
are increasingly alarming for national security, especially if an
intruder intercepts, alters, or disrupts the flow of critical,
time-sensitive information.

The rise in Russian and Chinese hybrid operations targeting Arctic lines
of communication heightens regional tensions. The absence of delineated
red lines for undersea infrastructure may weaken the credibility of
NATO's deterrence posture, undermine the alliance's resolve in
responding to attacks, and increase the risk of unintentional
escalation. However, the NATO Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell
has the potential to foster alliance cohesion, align threat perceptions
regarding undersea infrastructure, and reduce the chance of accidental
miscalculation. [[Red lines]{.mark} by themselves a[re **insufficient**
and]{.mark} could [prompt more **antagonistic acts**]{.mark} by
adversaries that fall **[under the]{.mark} established
[threshold]{.mark}**. Protecting critical undersea infrastructure
requires a more robust and **proactive solution**]{.underline}.

[[Combating **hybrid threats**]{.mark} in the]{.underline} European
[Arctic [requires]{.mark} enhanced [undersea]{.mark} **situational
[awareness]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark} the **[new]{.mark} generation** of
[quantum sensors]{.mark} will [provide]{.mark}]{.underline}. As global
connectivity grows, [both new and existing cables face]{.underline}
increasingly [complex challenges. Unlike traditional

the principles of [**quantum physics**, enabling **rapid** and
**precise** environment monitoring. [With]{.mark} **quantum

amid]{.mark} the fear of Russia potentially [deploying

also [[make]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[intrusions]{.underline}]{.mark}

Alternative Approaches to Protection

[While [NATO represents]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[one]{.mark} important
[framework]{.mark}** [for protecting]{.mark} undersea
[cables]{.mark}]{.underline}, alternative or [**complementary
approaches** deserve consideration]{.underline}. The \"competitive
response\" approach advocates for [[US]{.mark}]{.underline} competition
with China in the submarine cable market through alternate
[**[assistance]{.mark}** programs]{.underline}, which [would
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[redundancy]{.mark}** of secure
networks]{.underline}\[7\]. [This]{.underline} market-based [approach
might be [**more flexible** than]{.mark} the [NATO military
framework]{.mark}]{.underline} in some contexts.

[A [combination]{.mark} of strategies]{.underline} might [[prove **most
effective**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A 2021 study outlined four potential
[US policy responses]{.underline} [to Chinese threats to submarine
cables:]{.underline} isolationist (disconnecting from insecure
networks), cooperative (emphasizing international norms), competitive
(competing in the submarine cable market), and militaristic (using
military assets to defend cables)\[7\]. The [**most robust**
approach]{.underline} likely [combines elements of **all** these
strategies]{.underline} [rather than relying **solely** on NATO\'s
military capabilities.]{.underline}

Future Prospects for US-NATO Collaboration on Undersea Security

Strengthening NATO\'s Maritime Domain Awareness

[To maximize]{.underline} NATO\'s utility for US interests in [cable
protection]{.underline}, [enhanced [maritime]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**domain awareness**]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline} [[should be
**prioritized**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [increased]{.underline}
deployment of **[surveillance assets]{.underline}** through operations
[like Baltic Sentry represents]{.underline} [a **positive step**, but
[more comprehensive **monitoring systems** are
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly]{.underline} [[in
**vulnerable chokepoints**]{.underline}]{.mark} [where]{.underline}
multiple [cables converge.]{.underline}

NATO\'s experience with counterpiracy operations and maritime security
provides a valuable foundation for expanding into undersea
infrastructure protection. [[Building on]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[capabilities]{.underline} [while incorporating **new
tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[nologies]{.underline}** for underwater
surveillance [would [strengthen]{.mark} the Alliance\'s **[protective
capacity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Developing Clearer Legal Frameworks

[[The US can **lead**]{.mark} **efforts**]{.underline} [[within NATO to
develop]{.underline}]{.mark} clearer **[legal frameworks]{.underline}**
[for responding to]{.underline} [attacks on undersea
infrastructure.]{.underline} While full international consensus may be
difficult to achieve, [NATO could establish]{.underline} [[**internal
protocols** and **response mechanisms**]{.underline} [that
provide]{.underline}]{.mark} [**greater [clarity]{.mark}** [for
operations]{.mark}]{.underline} in international waters.

The New York Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea
Cables, proposed by [the United]{.underline} [States]{.underline} and
endorsed by several allies in September 2024, [represents an **important
step**]{.underline} [toward]{.underline} establishing [principles for
cable]{.underline} [security]{.underline}\[15\]. [**[Building on
this]{.mark}**]{.underline} foundation [[through **NATO**
]{.mark}**channels** could]{.underline} help
[[address]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the **[[jurisdictional
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** identified earlier.

[Much ink]{.underline} has been spilled about quantum computers,
particularly in overblown claims that quantum cryptanalysis will someday
shred today's encryption techniques. But their simpler
cousins---**[quantum sensors]{.underline}**---[are **here now** and
improving at a rate that demands **urgent attention**]{.underline}.

[Quantum sensors use the smallest amounts of energy and matter to
**detect and measure** tiny changes in **time**, **gravity**,
**temperature**, **pressure**, **rotation**, **acceleration**,
**frequency**, and **magnetic** and **electric fields**. They've been
**commercially available** in various forms]{.underline} for more than a
half-century; think of a magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, machine,
which tracks flips in the magnetic spin of individual hydrogen atoms to
peer into a body. [But **recent progress**]{.underline} in the field
[suggests]{.underline} that [such sensors will **soon** bring a
**revolution** in **measurement** and **signals
intelligence**]{.underline}---possibly by making it far easier to detect
submarines, spacecraft, and underground facilities.

Strategists must understand the new capabilities that quantum sensing
will provide and start planning countermeasures today. Here are three
examples that help explain why.

Measuring time

[Ultra-precise timekeeping]{.underline} is the most important
quantum-sensing achievement to date, for it [adds **precision** to all
other forms of sensing]{.underline}. For instance, [it allows us to make
**repeated observations** and **combine them**, an approach]{.underline}
that is sometimes [called "super resolution."]{.underline} Think of the
way today's photographers take four or eight photos of the same scene
and then combine the images using software. Better timing allows the
same kind of thing with all kinds of measurements.

The atomic clocks of the 1970s that underlie the Global Positioning
System and its attendant revolution---and miniaturized atomic clock are
becoming commercially available. Microsemi Corporation, for example,
sells a 35-gram "space chip scale atomic clock." Laboratories are
working on even better timing technology that promises to be just as
transformative. In 2018, NIST announced a breakthrough: a clock based on
a lattice of ytterbium atoms so sensitive that it wouldn't drift more
than a second in 10 billion years.

Location, location, location

Beyond making super-accurate GPS, [quantum sensors can measure the
**shape** and **gravitational field** of Earth to **within a
centimeter**. Such sensing can be useful both for **mapping out**
underground **mineral resources**]{.underline} and for precisely
calculating the trajectories of ballistic missiles and other munitions.

Militaries have long sought ways to get extremely precise location data
without using easily jammed GPS-type signals at all. [Quantum
positioning sensors **track minute changes** to **rotation** and
**acceleration**]{.underline}, using Newton's laws (adjusted for
relativity) to accurately infer changes to location over time. [Because
they do not depend]{.underline} on signals from [satellites or ground
stations, they **work anywhere**]{.underline}---indoors,
[**underground** or **underwater**]{.underline}---[and resist
jamming]{.underline}. Defense contractors are starting to make portable
QPS packages that could fit into weapons.

[The [risk of Russia- and China-backed **attacks on undersea
cables**]{.mark} carrying international internet traffic is [**likely to
rise** amid]{.mark} a spate of [incidents in]{.mark} the [Baltic Sea
and]{.mark} around [Taiwan]{.mark}, according to a report.]{.underline}

[[Submarine cables account for **99%** of]{.mark} the world's
intercontinental [data traffic]{.mark} and have been affected by
incidents with suspected state support over the past 18
months.]{.underline}

Analysis by Recorded Future, a US cybersecurity company, singled out
nine incidents in the Baltic Sea and off the coast of Taiwan in 2024 and
2025 as a harbinger for further disruptive activity.

[The report said that while [genuine accidents]{.mark} remained [likely
to cause **most undersea cable disruption**]{.mark}, the Baltic and
Taiwanese incidents pointed to increased malicious activity from Russia
and China.]{.underline}

["Campaigns attributed to [Russia]{.mark} in the North Atlantic-Baltic
region [and China]{.mark} in the western Pacific [are **likely to
increase in frequency** as tensions rise,"]{.mark} the company
said.]{.underline}

[Incidents flagged by the report included the severing of two submarine
cables between Lithuania and Sweden in the Baltic Sea last November,
which investigators **blamed on an anchor** dragged by a Chinese vessel.
In December a ship carrying Russian oil was seized after it severed
cables between Finland and Estonia.]{.underline}

Incidents around Taiwan over the past 18 months include a Chinese-crewed
freighter cutting cables between the island and its outlying Penghu
Islands in February by repeatedly manoeuvring in a zigzag pattern over
the cables. The previous month, a Chinese-owned cargo ship was cited as
the likely cause of damage to a Taiwan-US cable.

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

[The report said: "While it is difficult to definitively attribute
recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan to state-sponsored
sabotage, [such]{.mark} operations [align with]{.mark} both [Russia and
China's **strategic objectives**]{.mark}, recently observed activities,
[and current deep-sea **capabilities**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Recorded Future said a [**successful attack** on multiple
cables]{.mark} -- which would cause prolonged disruption -- would have
to occur in deeper waters and [would]{.mark} "very likely [involve
**state-sponsored threat actors**]{.mark}, due to the difficulty of
accessing these sites". Such an operation would probably take place
before outright conflict, the report said.]{.underline}

Geopolitical chess on the seabed

[The [strategic significance of **undersea cables**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in today's global landscape [[cannot be overstated]{.mark}. These
[cables]{.mark},]{.underline} often referred to as [the arteries of the
digital age, [are fundamental to]{.mark} the flow of
[info]{.mark}rmation [that **powers economies**]{.mark}, **[military
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}**, [and **international diplomacy**]{.mark}.
[They]{.mark} facilitate financial transactions amounting to **trillions
of dollars each day**, [host **military communications**]{.mark} that
are [essential for **national defense**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
transmit]{.underline} sensitive government [data that could **[influence
the fate of nations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[This]{.mark} infrastructure]{.underline}, hidden beneath the ocean's
surface, [[has become a focal point]{.mark} in the geopolitical chess
game, where [nations **vie for control**]{.mark}, security, and
surveillance advantages. The control of these cables is tantamount to
holding **strategic chokepoints**]{.underline} in the digital realm;
[[whoever controls these]{.mark} pathways can **[exert
influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} over global communication
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, by extension, [economic and [military
might]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [actions of]{.mark} countries like [Russia and China around
these]{.mark} cables are]{.underline} particularly [telling. There have
been increased instances of Russian naval vessels near]{.underline}
critical [undersea infrastructure, [lead]{.mark}ing [to suspicions
of]{.mark}]{.underline} activities ranging from mapping these routes for
potential **[[sabotage]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the actual execution of
such plans. The Baltic Sea incident in November 2024, where cables were
severed, is seen by many as a calculated move in this underwater chess
game. Such [actions could]{.underline} serve multiple strategic
purposes: [demonstrat]{.underline}ing [capability, test]{.underline}ing
[defenses, or]{.underline} even [prepar]{.underline}ing [for more
significant operations]{.underline} in future conflicts.

[China]{.underline}, on the other hand, [has previously been suspected
to be involved in similar incidents]{.underline}, like the 2023
Balticconnector damage, [which has spotlighted its possible strategic
interest in]{.underline} these [networks]{.underline}.

The **[surveillance]{.underline}** of these cables [is another layer of
this **geopolitical chessboard**. Nations are not only concerned with
protecting their cables but also with monitoring]{.underline} those of
[others]{.underline}. This has led to an increase in naval patrols, the
deployment of underwater drones, and international agreements aimed at
securing these vital assets. The incident in the Baltic Sea has thus not
only highlighted vulnerabilities but has also escalated the race to
secure, surveil, and potentially dominate these underwater pathways.

In this complex interplay, [[the]{.mark} control, [security]{.mark},
[and surveillance of]{.mark} undersea [cables are]{.mark}]{.underline}
not merely technical issues but are [[deeply intertwined]{.mark} with
**national interests**, [**global power** dynamics]{.mark}, and
the]{.underline} very [**essence of sovereignty** in the digital
age]{.underline}.

What's at stake?

[[The economic ramifications of]{.mark} cable [sabotage are
**immediate** and **severe**]{.mark}. In a world where nearly [**\$10
trillion** in daily]{.mark} financial [transactions flow
through]{.mark}]{.underline} these cables, [[even]{.mark} a [brief
interruption]{.mark} could [cause market volatility]{.mark}, disrupt
supply chains, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[lead to]{.mark}
economic [losses on a grand scale]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance,
[if financial markets lose connectivity, **[trading halts]{.mark}** can
occur, [leading to]{.mark} significant financial sector
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

On the espionage front, [undersea cables offer a treasure trove of
information. [Nations]{.mark}]{.underline} with the capability to tap
into these lines [[could gain access to]{.mark} government
communications, corporate **data**, or **[military
intelligence]{.mark}**, [providing]{.mark}]{.underline} them with
**[[strategic advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}** over rivals. [This has
turned cable security into a cat-and-mouse game of
surveillance]{.underline} and counter-surveillance, where both
[state]{.underline} actors [and]{.underline} possibly [non-state
actors]{.underline} seek to [exploit these vulnerabilities]{.underline}.

[The potential for sabotage]{.underline} to be used [in orchestrating
chaos in conflict scenarios is particularly alarming]{.underline}. By
targeting these cables, [an adversary could aim to **isolate** an enemy
nation, **disrupt** its **military operations**, or **sow
confusion**]{.underline} among civilian populations. [This scenario was
vividly brought to light by the Baltic Sea incident]{.underline}, where
[European officials speculated about Russian hybrid warfare]{.underline}
tactics.

Irina Tsukerman, President of Scarab Rising, Inc., and a noted
[geopolitical analyst]{.underline}, has [voiced significant concerns
regarding these incidents]{.underline}. Tsukerman elaborates on the
potential strategic motivations behind what is suspected to be Russian
sabotage, stating that the [[severing of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
Baltic Sea [cables]{.mark} "could be a strategic move by Russia,
impacting global internet traffic and NATO's security." The
implications]{.underline}, according to Tsukerman, [are **profound**.
"This act [may **escalate tensions**]{.mark}, **disrupt
communications**, [and **challenge NATO**'s]{.mark}
[infrastructure]{.mark}, potentially [leading to **increased military
presence**]{.mark} and **cybersecurity measures**]{.underline} in the
region."

In response to the accident, [nations are **re-engineering** their
**national security**]{.underline} approaches. [NATO, acknowledging the
strategic importance of these cables]{.underline}, has [intensified its
naval presence]{.underline} in key areas, notably in the Baltic and
North Seas, where Russian activities have been notably aggressive. New
task forces, like NATO's Critical Undersea Infrastructure Protection
Cell, are being established to coordinate responses, share intelligence,
and enhance the security of these vital networks. Countries are also
investing in technologies like underwater drones for surveillance and
rapid response to any detected threats.

Securing the depths: Strategies and challenges

[The task]{.underline} of securing undersea cables [is a **Herculean
effort**, involving a delicate balance of international law, military
strategy, and cooperation with the private sector]{.underline}. At the
legislative level, the primary framework is provided by the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ([UNCLOS]{.underline}), which,
while it offers some protection for cables in international waters,
[does not]{.underline} fully [address]{.underline} modern [security
threats]{.underline}. The ambiguity in legal protections has pushed
nations to seek more explicit agreements and treaties specifically aimed
at safeguarding undersea cables from sabotage or espionage.

The challenge lies in how to enforce these protections in areas where
jurisdiction is murky or where [state actors]{.underline} might choose
to [ignore international law for strategic gains]{.underline}. The push
for a more robust legal framework is evident in initiatives like the
Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea Cables,
endorsed by multiple nations, signaling a collective understanding of
the need for enhanced security measures.

[From a military perspective, the defense of]{.underline} these cables
often [falls to naval forces]{.underline}, who must adapt traditional
roles to include underwater surveillance and protection. This includes
not only increasing patrols but also deploying specialized equipment
like sonar systems and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for
continuous monitoring and quick response to incidents. However, military
actions are often reactive rather than preventive, highlighting the need
for a proactive security posture.

The private sector, owning and operating most of the world's cable
infrastructure, plays a critical role. Companies like Google and Meta,
which have significant investments in undersea cables, collaborate with
governments to enhance security. This includes sharing information about
cable routes, participating in drills for cable repair, and investing in
technologies that could detect tampering or unauthorized access.

The collaboration between public and private entities is crucial but
fraught with challenges. There's the issue of proprietary information,
where companies are reluctant to share detailed maps of cable routes or
security protocols. Additionally, the cost of implementing security
measures is substantial, and there's always the tension between security
and operational efficiency.

Despite these challenges, the [[necessity to]{.underline}
[secure]{.underline} ]{.mark}[undersea [cables is pushing]{.mark}
forward **[new innovations]{.mark}** in both technology and
policy]{.underline}. The establishment of international bodies dedicated
to undersea cable protection and the ongoing dialogue at international
forums reflect a growing consensus on the need to protect this unseen
but vital infrastructure from the **[[geopolitical
tug-of-war]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [is [increasingly played
out]{.mark} beneath the waves]{.underline}.

[The global submarine cable network represents **a paradox in modern
infrastructure**: it is simultaneously critical for our security and
vulnerable to external threats.]{.underline} Unlike traditional
strategic assets that can be physically hardened or relocated, submarine
cables follow largely fixed routes dictated by geography and
technological constraints. [The strategic significance of these cables
extends beyond mere communication capacity; [they represent **critical
chokepoints** in the global economy and international security]{.mark}
architecture.]{.underline}

[Recent incidents have demonstrated how submarine cables can become
instruments of hybrid warfare]{.underline}. The strategic positioning of
[[cable disruptions can]{.mark}]{.underline} serve multiple objectives:
[[degrad]{.mark}ing]{.underline} regional
[[communication]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities, forcing traffic onto
monitored routes[, [or creat]{.mark}ing [economic pressure]{.mark}
through targeted]{.underline} service [disruptions. The [asymmetric
nature]{.mark} [of]{.mark} cable [attacks makes them]{.mark}
particularly [attractive to actors seeking to exert influence while
**maintaining**]{.mark} **plausible [deniability]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[In the Baltic]{.mark} context, [cable vulnerabilities intersect
with]{.mark} broader regional [security concerns. The]{.mark} limited
number of cable routes and their [concentration]{.mark} in relatively
shallow waters [create]{.mark} natural [chokepoints that can be
exploited]{.mark} for strategic advantage]{.underline}. The October 2023
Baltic connector incident, a suspected sabotage of an undersea gas
pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea,8 demonstrated
how cable attacks could be integrated into broader hybrid warfare
strategies, combining infrastructure targeting with information
operations and political pressure.

The [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} situation
[[presents]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[more complex challenges]{.mark}.
The concentration of cables in the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait creates a
critical [vulnerability]{.mark} that [could be exploited during periods
of tensio]{.mark}n. The]{.underline} deep water [environment around
[Taiwan presents]{.mark}]{.underline} different technical [[challenges
for]{.mark}]{.underline} both attackers and
[[defenders]{.underline}]{.mark}, while the presence of multiple state
actors with competing interests complicates protection efforts. [The
potential for cable disruption serves as a form of strategic
leverage]{.underline}, enabling subtle pressure through selective
interference or the threat of comprehensive disconnection.

[[Modern]{.mark} cable [attacks range from]{.mark} crude physical
[disruption to sophisticated operations]{.mark} using advanced
underwater technologies.]{.underline} [Simple anchor dragging remains an
effective attack vector, providing plausible deniability
through]{.underline} apparent commercial shipping
[accidents]{.underline}. However, [[more sophisticated approaches are
emerging]{.mark}, including]{.underline} using AUVs capable of [precise
cable location and interference]{.underline}.

The development of cable tapping capabilities represents a particularly
concerning trend. Advanced technical capabilities enable data extraction
without physical cable damage, potentially allowing longterm
surveillance operations to go undetected. The emergence of quantum
sensing technologies may provide new detection capabilities and create
new vulnerabilities that sophisticated actors could exploit.

Current cable protection systems face significant limitations in both
detection and response capabilities. [[Traditional]{.mark} monitoring
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} often [rely on signal degradation to
detect interference, potentially allowing sophisticated attacks to go
unnoticed. The vast geographic scope of cable networks]{.underline},
combined with limitations in underwater surveillance capabilities,
[[create]{.mark}s substantial [monitoring]{.mark}
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.

cable systems. Hacking into a presentation server can therefore provide
attackers with access to control of multiple cable management systems.
Hackers could then attain unprecedented toplevel \[sic\] views of
multiple cable networks and data flows, discover physical cable
vulnerabilities, and disrupt and divert data traffic. With that access,
hackers/[**attackers** can gain a potential]{.underline} "**[kill
click]{.underline}**" -- with a click of a mouse [they [can delete
**wavelengths** and]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially, [significantly
[disrupt]{.mark} or alter **[global Internet]{.mark}** traffic
routes]{.underline}.

[[This]{.mark} nightmare scenario [is **all too
realistic**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the companies which operate the
undersea cables use commonplace operating systems like Linux and
Windows.44 The network management systems which these companies use
enable them to remotely control entire cables from a remote location at
the company. These connectivity possibilities make maintaining the lines
and gathering information about the cables very convenient, yet the
connections are also vulnerable to virtual hijacking in a scenario as
described above by Mr. Sechrist. 45

XI\. International Law, the Law of War, and International Humanitarian
Law

Whether their motive is information mining or to attack infrastructures
it is evident that the preventative NATO measures being planned are
paramount to the ongoing threat to the cables. The threat by Russian
activities is also an unexplored area of law for the most part. The term
"cyber warfare" is relatively new and also very ambiguous as it relates
to attacks by one country on another. The International Humanitarian Law
("IHL") "applies to cyber operations occurring during \[...\] or
triggering\[...\] an armed conflict. However, determining the beginning
of an armed conflict remains tricky in situations\[...\] short of any
kinetic use of force." 46 So basically, given the present-day principles
of IHL, a country can launch a cyber-attack such as interrupting
infrastructure communications without maintaining a physical presence in
the victim nation thus not implicating the traditional "Laws of War".

The Laws of War are part of international law that include s provisions
to regulate the appropriate and justifiable reasons to engage in war
between states (jus ad bellum) and the acceptable conduct during war
(jus in bello). 47 The goals of these laws of war as part of the larger
picture of IHL, which aim to limit the suffering caused by armed
conflict between nation states. Yet cyber-attack falls outside of the
traditional definition of war and therefore needs to be addressed on the
international level. This uncertainty leaves many openings for very
damaging attacks to occur without invoking consequences on the
perpetrators.

The difficulty in defining cyber hacking and attacks as warfare is
because traditional warfare takes place in some physical space while
"cyberspace" is a virtual space. This difference causes a disconnect in
the evaluation of such cyber-attacks. The ICRC discusses the various
elements of newly emerging cyber aggression and posits that ["\[t\]he
[effects]{.mark} of such]{.underline} '**[bloodless]{.underline}**'
[attacks [could obviously be **severe**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- for
instance, [[if **power** or **water**]{.mark} supplies [were]{.mark} to
be [interrupted]{.mark}]{.underline} or if a banking system were to be
taken down."48 It is this leap, from the virtual actions of foreign
nations, to the physical world of a country across an ocean that has
lawmakers and governments not sure how to define this new type of
aggression. It is the position of this paper that such [attacks
o]{.underline}n infrastructure, whether it be **[internet]{.underline}**
or a power grid, [is a deliberate **act of war** by another
country]{.underline}. This does not mean that every time a foreign
country is found to have hacked the United States that war drums should
sound, yet it is strongly advisable that the US respond proportionally
to such threats to deter escalation.

[Another **major threat** of attacks on]{.underline} infrastructure like
the [undersea cables]{.underline}, both physically or virtually, [is the
risk of]{.underline} what are known as "**[indiscriminate
attacks]{.underline}**". The indiscriminate attacks in the traditional
sense are violations of IHL. The International Court of Justice in The
Hague, Netherlands issued an advisory opinion in 1996 regarding the
legality of threat or use of nuclear weapons in which the court
discussed indiscriminate attacks. The ICJ serves as the principal
judicial organ of the UN and its purpose is to "settle, in accordance
with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to
give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized
United Nations organs and specialized agencies."49

Although the opinion is about nuclear weapons the same principles to the
indiscriminate nature of cyber-attack, the ICJ says weapons are
prohibited "because of their indiscriminate effect on combatants and
civilians."50 Cyber weapons should be placed in this same category
because attacks on infrastructure will not be limited to military
installation and the accuracy of such attacks is similar to explosives
in that there is peripheral damage to civilians. This peripheral damage
example is strongly exemplified by the ICRC's Report: ICRC,
International Humanitarian Law and the challenges of contemporary armed
conflicts in 2015. It states:

> [Most **military [networks]{.mark}** [rely on]{.mark}]{.underline}
> civilian cyber infrastructure, such as [**[undersea]{.mark}**
> \[fiber\]- optic [cables]{.mark}]{.underline}, satellites, routers or

Conclusion

[The **[connectivity]{.mark}** of the entire globe [relies
on]{.mark}]{.underline} about [**400 garden-hose-size [cables]{.mark}**
[stretching thousands of miles]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
**cables**]{.underline}, which could at any time be severed and
disrupted by various bad actors, [as **very vulnerable**]{.underline}.
Most alarming is that strong evidence points toward a Russian initiative
to bolster their military power, seek alternative non-physical forms of
attacks and to mask responsibility for hacking type attacks. These
indicators also point toward a [vulnerability of the undersea [internet
cables being **attacked by Russia**]{.mark} in order [to limit]{.mark}
or cut out [communication]{.mark} within the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and also between the United States [and its
**allies**]{.underline}. The days of traditional kinetic projectile
warfare have not yet gone by the wayside, yet, they are slowly taking on
a secondary spot in the arsenals of advanced nations. During Hurricane
Sandy in 2012, the tri-state felt the effects of having power cut off.
In some places power was extinguished for over a week's time and we saw
[the [fabric of **society**]{.mark} begin to **[stretch]{.mark}
thin**]{.underline} with lines at gas stations, bare shelves at
supermarkets, and a general panic of the public. The effects of [an
**infrastructure [attack]{.mark}** through soft internet targets
[**under the ocean** could lead to this]{.mark} very same [**discord**
on a]{.mark} much **[larger scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Given the likely economic and military impacts of cable breaks, the
ability to threaten or protect submarine cables and their shore landings
will be increasingly important in future conflicts. In a crisis, an
aggressor could use multiple coordinated attacks on cables to compel an
opponent to back down or employ them as part of an opening offensive to
cut off the defender's military forces from national commanders,
intelligence data, and sensor information. [[**Cable attacks**

While users' experience of the Internet is always local,1 [[**Internet**
infrastructure is]{.mark} **truly [global]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
unfolds across diverse material forms: light pulses under the sea, radio
waves through the air, electricity through copper wires under the earth.
There is nowhere on our planet where this infrastructure isn't. [You can
get an Internet connection **anywhere** on the surface of the
earth]{.underline}.

For me, this image of the planet evokes both wonder and anxiety. It's
something incredible, but it's also something that can destroy us.

[Like our **planet**, the Internet is **in danger**. And, **like the
planet**, [our **species**]{.mark} could [go **down with the
ship**]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 [If the Internet were to **destabilize**,
**industrial collapse** could well follow]{.underline}---locally,
regionally, or [globally]{.underline}.

Without hyperbole, [how we **steward** [the Internet]{.mark} will
**[determine]{.mark} the [fate]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} our
**[species]{.mark}**. We cannot approach **climate change** without a
global internet, let alone manage a **global system** of
**trade**]{.underline}.3 [A **changing [climate]{.mark}**[, aging
**infrastructure**, and **a**]{.mark}]{.underline}n increasingly
[**[multi-polar]{.mark}** international [stage]{.mark} has [produced a
**recipe for**]{.mark}]{.underline} disaster---or rather, for
**[numerous [disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}**---which I expect would
fall differentially along the usual lines of power and privilege.4

Yet no one (at least, no one we know of) can tell us what exact risks
the Internet faces. What would happen if Russia hit Cloudflare with a
Stuxnet-level cyberattack? What would happen if large and increasingly
frequent storms brought down power in major cities worldwide? In these
scenarios, who would be affected, and how? Our inability to answer these
questions signals our difficulty in protecting against---or prioritizing
between---the risks they invoke. It testifies to a broader inability to
assess risks about the Internet.

Like scientists building models of the climate in the 1960s and 1970s,
we need models of the Internet

[When it comes to the Internet, **what we lack** is this: a **structural
model** that describes how the whole thing fits together]{.underline}.
Like scientists building models of the climate in the 1960s and 1970s,
we need models of the Internet both to stave off disaster and shepherd a
stable and global internet into the future.

How do we build such a model? That's the question I'll puzzle through
over the next few weeks.

First, we'll have to understand why the Internet is in such danger. See
the next post in the series: Why is the Internet in danger?

Thanks to Sean Beld---you know why.

[Why is the **Internet** in **danger**?]{.underline}

Part 2. Toward a structural model of the Internet

Nick Merrill

Last week, I told you that the Internet is in danger. A fight for
control threatens to destabilize and fragment the Internet, and the
stakes are existential.

This week, I'll tell you why the Internet is in danger.

It's best to start with an example:

[A **storm** hits the **mid-Atlantic**]{.underline}. A big storm, ten or
a hundred times bigger than Ida. [[There are **mass**]{.mark}ive power
[**outages**, more **widespread**]{.mark}]{.underline} and harder to
recover from than those during Hurricaine Sandy. [[Data centers]{.mark},
Internet [exchange]{.mark} points, [and]{.mark} service [providers are
**offline**]{.mark}]{.underline}. What will happen to the global
Internet?

The received wisdom is, "Internet traffic will route around the failure.
Eventually, when power restores, the Internet will heal, bringing people
in affected regions back online."

Prove it! [Prove]{.underline} to me that Internet routing will heal in a
reasonable amount of time. That [the failure won't **cascade** to other
regions of the U.S., or to **other countries**]{.underline}.

That's our problem. [No one can argue with any **empirical certainty**
about **which kinds** of events **will or will not** cause the Internet
to **collapse** (bringing global **industrial production** down with
it)]{.underline}. The rest of this post elaborates on this predicament.
I address it from two angles: first, that we can't assess risks to the
Internet; and second, that we can't prioritize between opportunities to
improve it.

1\. We can't assess risk

During Superstorm Sandy, BGP1 did not heal the way we expected. That was
2012. I shudder to think what would happen now, in an Internet that's
more complex, interdependent, and privately-held2 than that one. (Now,
add in more frequent and severe storms in a changing climate).

Meanwhile, [[a **small number** of]{.underline}]{.mark} content
distribution networks (**[[CDNs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[serve]{.underline}]{.mark} most of the content on [[the Internet. CDN
service is]{.mark} **highly [centralized]{.mark}** among a few players
and absolutely ubiquitous]{.underline}; you can't use the Internet (let
alone host a service) without them. [[Centralization produces]{.mark}
**central [points]{.mark}** [of **failure**]{.mark}, and the opacity
caused by privatization confounds **oversight** and **risk
management**]{.underline}. Imagine a Stuxnet-level attack on Cloudflare.
What would happen?

While catastrophic internet failure remains unlikely, it's both more
likely than it should be and hard to estimate the exact likelihood of,
in part because we cannot articulate what types of events could
precipitate it.

What would happen if a storm bigger than Ida hit New York? If there were
widespread power outages in the Los Angeles Metro area? If Cloudflare
went down? No one knows how long it would take for BGP to heal in those
situations, let alone any downstream effect. That alone should terrify
you. While catastrophic internet failure remains unlikely, it's both
more likely than it should be and hard to estimate the exact likelihood
of, in part because we cannot articulate what types of events could
precipitate it.3

2\. We can't prioritize upgrades

[[The Internet]{.mark}, generally speaking, [is **fragile**]{.mark}
**and [insecure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many of the risks I mentioned
above stem from issues with its basic design.4 [Unfortunately, [starting
from **scratch**]{.mark}]{.underline} on this whole "internet" thing
[just [**isn't in the cards**: due to **global reliance**]{.mark} on the
Internet for trade, pricing, finance, healthcare, and pretty much
**everything else**]{.underline}, radical or disruptive change to the
Internet is not a practical option. Incremental change is the only way
to preserve a singular, globally shared Internet like the one we have
today.

We may only get one chance in a generation to upgrade any given
protocol.

As a result, the global Internet governance community is awash in
proposals to upgrade the Internet's fundamental operation. Replacing the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) with Secure BGP, upgrading the Domain Name
System (DNS) with DNSSEC, and the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 are just
a few examples of ongoing and proposed upgrades for the global Internet.

But performing these upgrades isn't as straightforward as it seems.
Here's why.

Upgrades take time---lots of time

[[As the]{.mark} globally uneven and still-ongoing
**[transition]{.mark}** from IPv4 to **IPv6**
[demonstrates]{.mark}]{.underline}, we may only get one chance in a
generation to upgrade any given protocol. And maintaining backward
compatibility---a necessary evil as upgrades roll out unevenly---raises
its own security challenges.5 We must pick strategically among upgrades,
given the high costs of performing them.

If the IPv6 upgrade happens at its current pace, will Africa run out of
IP addresses? If we fail to secure inter-domain routing, [could
[**Russia**, **China**, or the **U.S.** disrupt]{.mark} the **world's
[Internet]{.mark}** during a **conflict**?]{.underline}

Upgrades are political

[[**Internet upgrades** are]{.mark} political, especially in an
internet]{.underline} that, while still hegemonically dominated by the
U.S., [is increasingly **splintering** into **national internets** in
places like China, Russia, and the E.U. In practice, any internet
upgrade acts either as a **power-grab**]{.underline} (Huawei's NewIP is
an infamous example) [or an **implicit endorsement** of continued **U.S.
hegemony** over the network]{.underline}.

[As the Internet **increasingly** becomes [a site of **geopolitical
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}, 6 [we must articulate the political
risks of new upgrades]{.underline}, and weigh them against the upgrades'
projected upside. Currently, we lack an empirical foothold to do so: we
lack models that help us advocate for one upgrade over another.

As the Internet increasingly becomes a site of geopolitical conflict,
how do we articulate the political risks of new upgrades, weigh them
against their projected upside?

The Internet is opaque

We cannot effectively advocate for upgrades partly because we cannot
account for their effect on the contemporary Internet's most critical
infrastructure: privatized cloud services.7 Despite these
infrastructures' vital importance, we don't know how they connect to the
global Internet or one another. In an opaque network, operator upgrades
could matter more or less than we might expect them to.8

Is it prudent or wreckless to break up CDN monopolies? What about using
content-addressed protocols to supplant them?

Alternatives to our Internet are quickly emerging

Alternatives to the Internet stack are bubbling up with or without input
from the global Internet governance community. Rising interest in
blockchain technologies is yielding alternatives to core
application-layer technologies like DNS and TLS.9 New physical
infrastructures, be they in Brooklyn or Havana, afford the opportunity
to create parallel Internets from the ground up. Alternative physical
and logical internets threaten to fragment the global Internet in
unpredictable ways and with unforeseen consequences.

We have existing global governance mechanisms on one hand, and we have
radical change through the grassroots on the other. How do we weigh the
risks of revolution against the dangers of upgrading an insecure and
hegemonic Internet through its existing bodies?

Pivotal moments

Melting freshwater from Greenland's ice sheet is slowing down the AMOC
earlier than climate models suggested.

Melting ice in Greenland is slowing down the Gulf Stream more quickly
than expected, threatening its collapse. Exactly when the Gulf Stream
might collapse, and what might happen if it does, is impossible to
forecast precisely. Yet our models are good enough to tell us that such
a collapse would cost millions of lives. Photograph: Ulrik
Pedersen/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock

At the beginning of this post, I used the term "existential risk."
Forget that.

Consider this:

Climate crisis: Scientists spot warning signs of Gulf Stream collapse \|
The Guardian

Climate scientists have detected warning signs of the collapse of the
Gulf Stream, one of the planet's main potential tipping points.

\[\...\]

Such an event would have catastrophic consequences around the world,
severely disrupting the rains that billions of people depend on for food
in India, South America and West Africa; increasing storms and lowering
temperatures in Europe; and pushing up the sea level off eastern North
America. It would also further endanger the Amazon rainforest and
Antarctic ice sheets.

\[\...\]

The complexity of the AMOC system and uncertainty over levels of future
global heating make it impossible to forecast the date of any collapse
for now. It could be within a decade or two, or several centuries away.
But the colossal impact it would have means it must never be allowed to
happen, the scientists said.

Events like the Gulf Stream collapsing are granular, interim events.
Pivotal moments between today and possible tomorrows. Colossal events
that must not be allowed to happen. The goal of climate science is to
identify these moments and guide us to avoid them.

This is what we need to do for the Internet.10

Next week, I\'ll talk about how we might do it. I hope you\'ll join.

Forecasting a storm

Part 3 of a series

I'm a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity
where I direct the Daylight Lab. This newsletter is my work as I do it:
more than half-baked, less than peer-reviewed. This post is part of a
series on building a structural model of the Internet. Find the
beginning of that series here.

No one can argue with any empirical certainty about which kinds of
events will or will not cause the Internet to collapse. Without
empirical arguments, we can't identify which risks might cause global
chaos, let alone which upgrades would help protect against them. So how
could we make such arguments?

Only one method has stood the test of time: creating a model of the
environment in question and comparing its outputs to empirical
observations. By determining the model's errors and residuals against
observed data, researchers improve the model. Rinse and repeat. This
process is, broadly speaking, how we learned how to predict the weather.

Business Blackout

Here\'s an example of this concept executed well. In 2015, Lloyd\'s bank
constructed a scenario called Business Blackout, which assessed the
economic impact of widespread Internet failures.

The authors imagined a coordinated cyberattack on a series of power
stations in the Northeastern United States. Using various assumptions
about dependencies across different industries, they projected both
direct and indirect losses, projecting long-term GDP hits to the tune of
trillions of dollars.\[1\]This scenario highlights, if anything, that
turning the Internet off even for a few days can produce unbelievably
large costs to society. So the costs of the global Internet collapsing
are unfathomable. But I take it you already believe me the stakes are
high here, or you wouldn't be reading the footnotes.\[/1\]

Comparing observations to expectations

Business Blackout is a careful and defensible economic analysis. But
there's a critical difference between this model and a weather model.
With a weather model, I can make a projection for the next day and go to
sleep. I'll wake up the next morning and see how I did. By repeatedly
"diffing" my projection against observation, I can iteratively improve
my model. Multiply this process across every inhabited location on
Earth, and you're getting a lot of corrective cycles in.

We can't compare Business Blackout to anything! What am I supposed to
do, wait for a cyberattack on the Northeastern power grid? How are we
supposed to improve our ability to make such models in any general sense
without some empirical grounding in observed outages?

In general, how can we compare model errors and residuals when we
simulate the impact of black-swan events?2 By intentionally causing
outages in order to refine our models. I'll be talking a lot more about
this concept in the coming weeks. But hold onto it for now, as there are
some other components to cover first.

Tweak, update, reproduce

Let's cover a few more downsides of the Business Blackout model.3 The
model is hard to reproduce or update. What if I need to try different
model parameters? There's no code to run! As the world and Internet
change (as they both have since 2015), [the [ability to]{.mark}
**flexibly [update]{.mark}** [models is]{.mark} increasingly
**[important]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[4\]As I\'ve already argued, [a
**stable [Internet]{.mark}** [is a **prerequisite** for]{.mark} **global
[stability]{.mark}**. We're pretty "locked-in" to this Internet, so
disruptions to it would be **mega-bad**]{.underline}, as I've argued.
But even beyond that historical circumstance, I believe a singular,
shared system of communication is a global, pre-competitive good,
conceptually similar to global trade.

\[/4\]

What can we do to make this kind of structural analysis accessible and
reproducible enough to guide and inform diverse decision-makers
(government, industry, civil society, and beyond)? We need an open,
structural model on top of which different simulations can be run and
their results shared for reproducibility. As we'll discussing in the
coming weeks, this 'spec' sometimes collides with legitimate needs for
privacy and secrecy, which range from individual privacy to national
security. Again, hold on to this idea. There's one more thing to cover.

Control points and systemic risk

One last critique of the Business Blackout model. While its approach to
calculating economic reverberations of an Internet outage is
fine-grained, its approach to the Internet itself is relatively coarse.
The authors imagine an Internet-based attack, which is itself realistic,
but the attack simply turns the power off. This sort of analysis might
be helpful for Internet shutdowns of the sort we\'ve seen in India and
beyond, but the most dangerous Internet disruptions are more complex
than the Internet being on or off.

Consider: On the morning of Thursday, June 8, 2021, Amazon.com was down.
CNN was down. HBO, Pinterest, Spotify, GitHub, Reddit, Twitch,
StackOverflow were all down. So was gov.uk, the UK\'s government
website. What happened? A coordinated cyberattack? No, just human error
at Fastly, the world\'s second-largest content delivery network (CDN).

[[CDN **downtime**]{.mark} can [cause **cascading**
failures]{.mark}]{.underline}---what Welburn & Strong (2019) call
systemic risk. For example, even if the Financial Times does not
directly use Fastly on their user-facing webpage, a build tool in their
engineering supply chain may require a library that\'s stored on a
Fastly server. As a result, a Fastly outage will bring down the
Financial Times via its supply chain. Think of it this way: billions of
web pages use thousands of different software supply chains, using some
combination of the same hundreds of common tools, which are in turn
delivered by some eleven CDNs. [[Disruptions]{.mark} at the base of this
inverted pyramid can [cause]{.mark} **massive**, and
difficult-to-predict **patterns of failure**]{.underline} at the levels
above.

[This class of errors---**[systemic risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}---are
our primary concern. And CDNs are a wonderful example of how they

be]{.mark}]{.underline} other [**[trials]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} **[threaten]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[our future
[survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the argument here is that they're
unlikely to be the same as the old ones.

In this chapter, we'll examine what the new threats look like.

First, let's clarify that [several]{.underline} **[existential
threats]{.underline}** may be unchanged by the advent of the internet.
For example, in 1948, Melvin Tumin and John Bennett proposed
prerequisites for a civilization's survival that [included]{.underline}
the basic [**[nutritional]{.underline}** [needs]{.underline}]{.mark} of
a society, [[construction of a]{.mark} good]{.underline}
[**[legal]{.underline}** [system]{.underline}]{.mark} concerning
property and trade, the [[maintenance of]{.underline}
**[order]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the form of executive and judicial
branches, [[and]{.mark} meaningful]{.underline}
**[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** abroad. Will the internet touch on
these other challenges? Perhaps, but there's no guarantee. The hope is
that **[crowdsourcing]{.underline}** [and democratized]{.underline}
**[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}** [will allow us to
improve]{.underline} **[food]{.underline}** [distribution
and]{.underline} long-distance [**[medical]{.underline}**
[care]{.underline}]{.mark}[, increase]{.underline}
**[transparency]{.underline}** in government, [[and]{.mark}
improve]{.underline} **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations. It is hopeful, but not inevitable.

More generally, we saw in the previous chapter the suggestion of Tainter
and Toynbee that societies fail because they do not change their fixed
designs for solving problems. In other words, civilizations discover
problems for which they can find no solution. I suggested that [the
democratization of education might give us]{.underline} some
**[fortification]{.underline}** against this outcome: [by capitalizing
on]{.underline} **[billions of brains]{.underline}** [we become
more]{.underline} **[innovative]{.underline}** [in the face of
danger]{.underline}. Of course, we have no real guarantee that this
approach will be sufficient against the infinitely versatile misbehavior
of future eons.

The hope that the internet will spur continuously innovative thinking in
our society is something to be devoutly wished for, but there is no way
to be certain.

CAN THE NET GO DOWN?

[[Because the internet has become]{.underline}]{.mark} such an
**[[integral]{.underline}]{.mark}** part of our world, [[we may be
in]{.underline} **[more danger than ever]{.underline}**]{.mark} should
it go down. [The internet has not yet stopped working in its first
10,000 days, which encourages many people to surmise that
it]{.underline} [**never will**. But]{.underline} like any system --
biological or manmade -- [it has the potential to become]{.underline}
**[pathological]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[stop
functioning]{.underline}**. I suggest there are four main maladies to
worry about.

1\. Cyberwarfare

Wars of the future will be fought less by rugged soldiers in the field,
and increasingly by smart kids in their workout clothes perched in front
of computers slamming energy drinks. As our dependence shifts onto the
internet, so do our vulnerabilities.

This future can already be detected in the tight relationship between
corporeal conflicts and cyber attacks. When one examines the physical
conflicts between India and Pakistan, the Israelis and Palestinians, or
the parties in the collapse of Yugoslavia, the escalation of meat-space
violence is immediately mirrored by cyberspace warfare.

The main targets in cyberwar are largely military targets, but
increasingly large multinational corporations are in the crosshairs as
well. Take one of them down, even temporarily, and you have done more
damage to the economy of your enemy than scores of soldier deaths.

Since the beginning of the computer era -- the 1960s -- there have been
[computer]{.underline} **[[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}**: programs
[that latch onto a host]{.underline} system [to reproduce]{.underline}
themselves [and send out]{.underline} **[new copies]{.underline}**. Just
as in biology, as computers have evolved in sophistication, so viruses
have co-evolved. And the cousins to the viruses -- worms -- do not even
need a host system, but can multiply themselves over networks.

Wondering if these are only a minor or theoretical concern? Consider the
Stuxnet worm that raised its head in June 2010. This worm zigzagged its
way into Iranian industrial systems, reprogrammed them and hid its
tracks. Seemingly coming from nowhere, it proved itself as a
destructive, unstoppable herald of what's to come.

It will surprise no one that cyberwarfare of the future [[will]{.mark}
involve]{.underline} the [**[target]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} not only
of military and industrial targets, but more
[**[general]{.mark}**ly]{.underline} of **[[internet
connectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If you want to take down your
enemy, start by taking down their net.

2\. Cutting cables

Although satellites are used for some internet traffic, over 99 percent
of traffic is dependent on deep-sea networks of fiber-optic cables that
blanket the ocean floor like a nervous system. These are a major
physical target in wars, especially at special choke-points in the
system. And this is not simply a theoretical prediction -- the
underwater battles are well underway.

As much as three quarters of the international communications between
the Middle East and Europe have been carried by two undersea cables:
SEA-ME-WE 4 and FLAG Telecom's FLAG Europe--Asia cable. On January 30,
2008, both of these cables were cut, severely disrupting internet and
telephone traffic from India to Egypt.

It is still not clear how the cables were cut -- or by whom. And for
that matter, it is not clear how many cables were cut: some news reports
suggest that there were up to at least eight. Initial speculations
proposed that the cuts came from a ship anchor, but a video analysis
soon revealed there were no ships in that region from twelve hours
before until twelve hours after the slice.

Those cables were only the beginning. A few days later, on February 1,
an undersea FLAG Falcon cable in the Persian Gulf was cut fifty-five
miles off the coast of Dubai. On February 3, a cable between the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar was cut. On February 4, the Khaleej Times
reported that not only these cables had been affected, but also two more
-- a Persian Gulf cable near Iran, and a SEA-ME-WE 4 cable off the coast
of Malaysia.

These cuts led to widespread outages of the internet, especially in
Iran. Suspicions that this reflected underwater sabotage derived in no
small part from the geographical pattern: almost all the cables were cut
in Middle Eastern waters near Muslim nations. Who might have done it? No
one knows. But it is known that the US Navy has deployed undersea
special operations for decades -- in Operation Ivy Bells, for example,
US Navy divers appear to have swum from submarines to tap an undersea
cable in the Kuril Islands.

Whatever the truth behind the incident, we see that if a government or
organization wants badly enough to sabotage the telecommunications
across a wide swath, it is possible. New deep-sea cables are urgently
needed to protect the global economy -- because businesses worldwide are
vulnerable to the targeting of 'choke points' in underwater
communications. Whether by terrorists, governments, or cyberpirates,
these weak points in the chain should be keeping us all up at night.

3\. Political mandate

In the face of the 2010 post-election riots in Iran, the government
there shut down the net for forty-five minutes, presumably to set up
filtering of YouTube, Twitter, and other sites. Egypt did the same in
the revolution of early 2011. China is actively pursuing the capability
to shut down its own internet this way.

But it's not just countries like Iran and China that think about this
kind of control over the net. In 2010, a homeland security committee in
the United States senate approved a bill to give the president authority
to do exactly this same thing: to have and to hold an internet
kill-switch. The bill, Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act
(PCNAA), proposed to give the president 'emergency authority to shut
down private sector or government networks in the event of a
cyber-attack capable of causing massive damage or loss of life'.

Almost unanimously, internet security analysts feel that shutting down
the net would inevitably do more harm than good, given our predicted
level of dependency on it in time of war for news, communication with
loved ones, and crisis information aggregation.

Security guru Bruce Schneier identifies at least three problems with the
idea. First, the hope of building an 'electronic Maginot Line' is
flawed: there will always be hundreds of ways for enemies to get around
it. No nation or legal decree can plug all the holes.

The second major problem is that we will be entirely unable to predict
the effects of such an attempted shutdown. As Schneier puts it: 'The
Internet is the most complex machine mankind has ever built, and
shutting down portions of it would have all sorts of unforeseen
ancillary effects.'

The third major problem is the security hole it exposes. Once a domestic
internet kill-switch has been built, why would a cyberattacker
concentrate his efforts on anything else?

Given that the number of people who could use the net for good in a
crisis situation will presumably outnumber the bad guys, it is probably
best to not cut off our heavy dependence on the internet just when
things are going bad. A survey by Unisys found 61 percent of Americans
in approval of the internet kill-switch concept, which means this issue
will require constant vigilance. Although the bill didn't pass the House
and Senate, its specter will surely resurface every several years. Be
sure to tell your congressmen: back away from the switch, slowly.

4\. Space weather

When you think about the internet, you probably don't worry about what's
happening on the surface of the sun 92 million miles away. But you
should. Solar flares are one of the most serious threats for our
communication systems.

Consider satellite failures. One fine day in 1998, the Galaxy IV -- a
\$250 million satellite floating 35,000 kilometers above the planet --
suddenly spun out of control. Although it is difficult to know for
certain, it is suspected this was because of a solar flare: the sun was
acting up at that time, and several other satellites (owned by Germany,
Japan, NASA, and Motorola) all failed at the same time. In any case, the
effects were instant and worldwide. Eighty percent of pagers instantly
went down. Physicians, managers, and drug dealers all across the United
States looked down and realized they were no longer receiving pages.
NPR, CBS, Direct PC internet, CNN's airport network and dozens of other
services went down. It is estimated that in recent years at least twelve
satellites have been lost due to the effects of space weather.

But it's not just satellites that we have to worry about. When a massive
solar flare erupts on the sun, it can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth.
The largest solar eruption recorded so far was in 1859. Known as the
Carrington flare, it sent telegraph wires across Europe and America into
a sparking, fritzing frenzy.

Since that time, the technology blanketing the planet has changed quite
a bit. If we were to get another solar flare of that size now, what
would happen? The answer is clear to space physicists and electrical
engineers: it would blow out transformers and melt down our computer
systems. In a small disruption in 1989, an electromagnetic storm
arrested power throughout most of Quebec and halted the Toronto stock
market for three hours.

A major solar event could theoretically melt down the whole net. What
earthquakes, bombs, and terrorism cannot do might be accomplished in
moments by a solar corona.

Given our dependence on the communication systems of our planet -- both
satellite- and ground-based, this is not simply a theoretical worry. The
next major geomagnetic storms are expected at the peak of the next solar
sunspot cycles, so hang on tight.

PROPOSAL: A SEED VAULT FOR THE NET

The Global Seed Vault in Svalbard is wedged into a small island in the
Arctic, halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. It's not a
popular vacation destination unless you're Santa or a seed biologist.
The vault is a secure bank for the future of the world. It holds
duplicate samples -- that is, spare copies -- of seeds held in gene
banks worldwide. The seed vault provides insurance in the event of
large-scale regional or global crises. If a nuclear winter, say, were to
wipe out all the crops on the planet, future generations could reboot
the agricultural system by hoofing it out to Svalbard.

I propose that we need to have a similar back-up security plan for the
human knowledge that underlies the internet. I'm not talking about
something like the Wayback Machine, which takes snapshots of websites
through time. I'm talking about simple instructions, burned onto
physical media, for how to generate electricity, how to build a
computer, how to build a router and how to reconstitute the internet
from basic principles. The internet may be the single most important
technology that's ever been invented. We have been the generation lucky
enough to witness its inception, and we are now the ones responsible for
its protection.

Remember life before the internet? Neither do I. But this book has been
about reaching back into that not-sodistant past to understand what the
threats were then and how they have changed now.

**[[Great societies]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as the Romans,
Athenians, Spartans, Egyptians, Mali, Songhai, Aztecs, Babylonians,
Mesopotamians, Toltec, Maya and Anasazi [[have]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**grown up**, sundered the bonds of]{.underline}
**[self-preservation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[[collapsed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I have argued that [the advent of
the]{.underline} [**[internet]{.underline}** [greatly]{.underline}
**[reduces]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the potency of]{.underline}** six
**[[major existential threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that
have]{.underline} **[brought them down]{.underline}**: **[[epidemics,
natural disasters, poor info]{.mark}rmation [flow]{.mark}, political
[corruption, resource depletion, and economic
meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

How will the internet shape our civilization's trajectory? It's
impossible to know. But it appears that [vast, [networked communication
serves as an **antidote**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} **several
[fatal societal diseases]{.mark}**. Almost as an epiphenomenon of our
other goals, we now command the capacity for **self-quarantining**,
retaining]{.underline} [**knowledge**, **speeding**]{.underline}
**[info]{.underline}**rmation flow, [reducing]{.underline}
[**censorship**, actualizing]{.underline} [**human capital**,
and]{.underline} **[saving energy]{.underline}** resources. So the next
time your co-worker laments about pervasive
**[[internet]{.underline}]{.mark}** addiction, fake news, the tyranny of
email, and the diminishment of former values, you may want to suggest
that this invention -- even with all its flashy wastefulness --
[[may]{.mark} just [be the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[thing that saves
us]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[[**Russia** and **China**]{.mark} have no qualms about **going low** to
gain an advantage over the United States --- and now they're [going even
lower, **targeting subsea cables** that carry]{.mark}]{.underline} the
vast majority of our and [our allies' **[internet
traffic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, phone calls [[and **trillions of
dollars'**]{.mark} worth [of]{.mark} financial [transactions
daily]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Over the past several months both [Moscow and Beijing]{.mark}, seeking
to **disrupt** and **intimidate**]{.underline} the West,
[have [**intensified their attacks** on]{.mark} undersea
[infrastructure, forcing the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}
its [allies]{.mark} and partners [to protect]{.mark} these critical
connections]{.underline}.

[[Perceiving themselves in]{.mark} a **[long-term conflict]{.mark}**
with the United States but fearful]{.underline} of American military and
economic might, [both [Russia and China]{.mark} have
embraced]{.underline} more [discreet means to [undermine
Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Rather than challenge us militarily, [they're [using **"grey zone"**
measures]{.mark}, such as **[damaging critical infrastructure]{.mark}**,
to [cause **societal chaos** and **damage
readiness**]{.mark}]{.underline} without prompting painful retaliation.

[[The **ripple effects**]{.underline}]{.mark} of these efforts
[[are]{.mark} readily [apparent]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Taiwan's Coast Guard [reported]{.underline} this week [that [an
**undersea**]{.mark} fiber-optic **[cable]{.mark}**]{.underline} running
between Taiwan and its outlying islands [had been cut ---
**[severed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, they alleged, by a ship crewed by
Chinese nationals and backed by Chinese capital.

[It was far from an isolated incident]{.underline}: In February 2024,
[[a Chinese]{.mark} fishing [boat **dropped anchors** on two]{.mark}
undersea [cables]{.mark}]{.underline} connecting Taiwan with its
outlying island of Matsu.

Meanwhile, [[US officials warned]{.mark} in May that Chinese repair
[ships or]{.mark} advanced **[u]{.mark}**ncrewed **[u]{.mark}**ndersea
**[v]{.mark}**ehicles may also be tampering with undersea
cables]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.mark} has [been a **prime suspect**]{.mark} in similar
**sabotage efforts**]{.underline} in its own neighborhood.
[[**Confronted** by]{.mark} NATO's conventional **[military
might]{.mark}**, Moscow has [embraced]{.mark} more **[subtle
tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} to disrupt European security without
triggering retaliation.

In December, [a vessel in the [Russian **"shadow fleet"**]{.mark} that
[evades]{.mark} Western **[sanctions]{.mark}** allegedly dragged its
anchor across one power cable and **four communications
cables**]{.underline} connecting Finland, Estonia and Germany beneath
the Baltic Sea, cutting them. 

[To counter this growing undersea threat, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and its partners [must **build resilience**]{.mark} into
the subsea cable infrastructure]{.underline} --- a project that's long
overdue.

[Washington can]{.underline} kickstart the process by
**[cut]{.underline}**ting [the **red tape** that delays undersea
projects]{.underline}.

[Russia's]{.underline} [threatening]{.underline} [activity]{.underline}
[has **not been disrupted**]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} ongoing [war against Ukraine]{.underline}. The Russian
leadership places great [value]{.underline} on GUGI, a US official told
CNN, continuing to fund the unit even while waging war in Ukraine.

A US official told CNN [the US would consider any]{.underline} such
[sabotage of undersea infrastructure]{.underline} as [a **significant
escalation** in Russian aggression]{.underline} outside of Ukraine.

"[Any activities]{.underline} [that damaged]{.underline} seabed

[during]{.underline} periods of [heightened tensions risks
**misunderstandings**]{.underline} and misperceptions [that]{.underline}

And, think about it, [[there is no]{.underline}]{.mark} absolute
[[guarantee that]{.mark} the world's]{.underline} critical [[subsea
infra]{.mark}structure [has not **already been compromised**]{.mark} by
**hostile actors**]{.underline}. In fact, [[given]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} strategic [importance of submarine cables]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [the]{.underline} increasing [[**sophistication**

[[been **identified**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [mapped]{.underline},
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} even [covertly

In short, [[the absence of evidence is **not evidence of

the]{.underline} [undersea environment]{.underline}
[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[strategic surprise
is]{.underline}]{.mark} still possible (maybe even
**[[likely]{.underline}]{.mark}**). It is also worth remembering that
most submarine cables operate in the dark in the historical and even
present-day context. We rely on their redundancy and robustness, [[but
we]{.underline}]{.mark} [largely [lack]{.mark}]{.underline} the

[Alarm over the security]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [the

### Cables\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Private Cables\-\--2AC

#### Monopolies over cables [heighten]{.underline} the risk of [global failure]{.underline}.

1-4-2025//ILake-AW

Where do the US tech giants fit in?

[Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon]{.underline} [have]{.underline} an
[**increasing influence** on the subsea cable industry]{.underline},
which hasn't yet been seriously considered, according to ASPI. They are
already [widely referred to as "**hyperscalers**]{.underline}" for their
growing scale and control over the cable systems.

"[These]{.underline} hyperscalers [account for the **majority** of total
submarine]{.underline} **[cable capacity usage]{.underline}**, with that
share continuing to grow," ASPI's Kang said. "This means that an
[increasing portion of the world's data]{.underline} is [under the
stewardship of only a **few entities**]{.underline},
[making]{.underline} the [availability of]{.underline} that [data highly
dependent on]{.underline} their [**seamless operation**.]{.underline}

"[Such a concentration]{.underline} [creates]{.underline} a [digital
supply-chain **dependency risk**]{.underline}, [where]{.underline}
potential [disruptions could lead to **widespread
consequences**]{.underline}. Additionally, [as]{.underline} their
[bandwidth needs to increase]{.underline}, [hyperscalers]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} [transitioning]{.underline} from being primary
customers of network capacity [to **owning and operating** subcable
systems."]{.underline}

Kang warned that if the tech giants continue to control the world's
subsea cables, it would [heighten the risk of a **single point of
failure**]{.underline}. She said the shift in power dynamics means
governments --including Australia's -- must engage more directly with
the tech giants to get the best balance between commercial interests and
safeguarding national interests.

### Cables\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Inevitable/Accidents\-\--2AC

#### Only coordinated [sabotage]{.underline} has cascading effects -- accidents have [minimal]{.underline} impact.

Henri Van **Soest 24**, Senior analyst at RAND Europe, \"Undersea
Infrastructure Needs Better Protection\", RAND,
https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/03/vital-yet-vulnerable-undersea-infrastructure-needs.html,
3-11-2024//ILake-AW

We should stress that [[disruptions to **undersea**]{.underline}
[infra]{.underline}]{.mark}[structure]{.underline}
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} already **[[common]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
These disruptions are [mostly [caused by **accidents** or **natural
events**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and hostile action remains comparatively
rare. Because of this, [most undersea infrastructure is
designed]{.underline} [with]{.underline} some [resilience]{.underline}
and the probability of damage [in mind]{.underline}.
[[Telecommunications]{.underline} [cables]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [[can be repaired]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively
[**[quickly]{.underline}** [and they have]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[high]{.underline}]{.mark} level of
**[[redundancy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, because there are many of them.
There are fewer undersea electricity cables, which means they have less
redundancy, but overall, [the power system]{.underline} as a whole [is
designed]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the likely [breakage of
**individual components**]{.underline} in mind, which could limit the
impact of disruptions. Oil and gas pipelines are more easily affected,
as the disruption of a pipeline connecting an oil or gas field to the
mainland could result in the entire field going offline. However, these
pipelines are typically made of thick steel and occasionally encased in
concrete, which increases their physical protection and resilience.

All this means that [an attack on any single connection]{.underline} in
the networks that brings fuel, power, and data to our shores
[would]{.underline} likely [have a]{.underline} relatively **[limited
impact]{.underline}**. [[However]{.mark}, a **[coordinated
disruption]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **critical nodes**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} **[hubs]{.underline}** could [[lead to **cascading
impacts**]{.underline} [which]{.underline}]{.mark} [could [affect
**entire systems**]{.mark} and lead to spiralling costs of
**disruption**]{.underline}, [[with **knock-on effects**]{.underline}
[across the **wider economy** as well as government]{.underline}]{.mark}
[function[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, hospitals, and services. This could be
[[a prelude to]{.underline}]{.mark} wider [**[military
action]{.mark}**,]{.underline} or a hostile attempt to coerce a target
state short of war.

[The [**inability** to carry out]{.mark} a large number of **financial
[transactions]{.mark}** and commercial communications [could **trigger
panic**]{.mark} **in the capital market**, [increase]{.mark} **market
[uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly
[[trigger a **financial crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Second, the threat capability held by the Houthis in Yemen is real, and
they have proven themselves capable of launching
[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[pose a direct threat to **global
communications**]{.mark} facilities]{.underline}.

This reinforces global concerns about the conflict in the Middle East.
In this context, the continued looming situation in Yemen will further
increase global tensions

There are more regions throughout the world where instability and
disputes are highlighted, especially in the Middle East, where frequent
conflicts and wars make the global situation full of variables.

[And this time]{.underline}, the [Houthis]{.underline} in Yemen have
[issued a threat [that]{.mark} undoubtedly [increases]{.mark} the
[pressure and risk]{.mark} of the global **political** and **economic
system**]{.underline}.

To summarize, [the]{.underline} Houthi [threat may]{.underline} not only
lead to a geopolitical crisis but [also pose a threat [to the **global
financial market**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Disruptions risk [financial panic]{.underline} and
[crisis]{.underline}.**

The Impact of Undersea Cable Disruptions on Business Continuity and
Global Supply Chains

Unlike Russia, whose internet cables mostly run overland, the
[[communication]{.mark} lines of Western]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
other [global partners are]{.underline} deep [undersea]{.underline}, and
[this]{.underline} asymmetrical [[**vulnerability**]{.mark}
could]{.underline} [be]{.underline} [**easily [exploited]{.mark}**
[by]{.mark} threat [actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, businesses
([**[financial services]{.mark}**, **[e-commerce]{.mark}**]{.underline}
platforms, and [technology firms]{.underline}) and global supply chains
[that are [**heavily reliant** on]{.mark} real-time
[communication]{.mark} transmitted by undersea cables]{.underline}
[could [experience]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[severe
consequences]{.underline}** [if sabotage]{.underline}
[becomes]{.underline} [a **recurring** tactic]{.underline}]{.mark}
adopted by adversarial nations. According to Forbes, the average cost of
downtime has inched as high as \$9,000 per minute for large
organizations, while for critical-infrastructure enterprises,
particularly in finance and healthcare, downtime represents a
multidimensional economic catastrophe: the [\$5 million hourly cost
encompasses]{.underline} far [more than]{.underline} [immediate
productivity losses]{.underline}---[[it's a]{.mark} **comprehensive
[destruction vector]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[targeting]{.mark}
regulatory [compliance]{.mark}, **[market valuation]{.mark}**, client
[trust, and]{.mark} long-term **[competitive
positioning]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Another recent study highlighted the
frightening consequences of [three undersea]{.underline} [cable cuts in
the Red Sea]{.underline} in 2023 [estimating]{.underline} the
[costs]{.underline} of disruptions for businesses [to be \$3.5
billion]{.underline}.

Recent cable severances in the Baltics did not result in an internet
blackout, but just in a lower bandwidth and disruption for individual
users and companies, as data traffic is typically rerouted very quickly
in areas served by multiple subsea cables. However, [cable
[damage]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially [[if severed **in a
row**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [has]{.underline} the [potential to [leave
an **entire nation** cut off]{.mark} from global data]{.underline},
leaving them solely reliant on satellites to communicate. Therefore,
[[businesses]{.mark} can [suffer]{.mark}]{.underline} [**significant
disruptions** in terms of loss of communication, **[financial
breakdowns]{.mark}** and reputational damage.]{.underline} The
[inability to carry out]{.underline} many [financial
transactions]{.underline} and commercial communications [could [trigger
**panic** in the]{.mark} capital [market]{.mark}]{.underline}, [increase
market uncertainty]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly
[[initiate]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[financial
crisis.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Lack of cables would crush the economy.

Perhaps the biggest difference between Britain and Tonga, however, is
just how bad things could get [[were our **cables**]{.mark} to be
[cut]{.mark}]{.underline}. For a start, [[the **financial**]{.mark}
system [would]{.mark} probably [**collapse**. The]{.mark} US
[Fed]{.mark}eral Reserve [estimates]{.mark} that more than **[\$10
trillion dollars]{.mark}** [are transmitted]{.mark} via undersea cables
**[every day]{.mark}**. The **[SWIFT]{.mark}** system]{.underline},
which moves money between 11,000 financial institutions in millions of
transactions each day, [[is dependent on cables]{.underline}.]{.mark} As
Sunak puts it: "[[In such a]{.mark} highly [interdependent
world,]{.mark} the **[shockwaves]{.mark}** resulting from a major cable
disruption]{.underline} at a leading financial centre such as London...
[[are]{.mark} potentially [**catastrophic**. If an adversary were
to]{.mark} succeed in [execut]{.mark}ing [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
successful [[attack]{.underline}]{.mark} against Britain's undersea
cable infrastructure [[the result would be **financial disaster** on an
**unprecedented**]{.mark} **[scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[The shockwaves would not merely be economic]{.underline}. Earlier this
month, the incoming head of the UK's armed forces, Admiral Tony Radakin,
said that [[Russian activity could]{.underline}]{.mark} "put at risk and
potentially **[[exploit]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the world's real
[information]{.mark} system]{.underline}, which is undersea cables that
go all around the world". [[Targeting them]{.underline}]{.mark}, he
suggested, [[might be]{.mark} considered an **["act of
war"]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

It is obvious why. [[The most advanced militaries rely on
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2008, [[three cables]{.mark} linking Italy
and Egypt [were]{.mark} accidentally [cut]{.mark}]{.underline} (100-150
are severed each year, according to Telegeography, the vast majority due
to fishing equipment, or dragging anchors). Suddenly, [**[data
connectivity]{.mark}** between Europe and the Middle East
[plummeted]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the time, [Britain and America had
[more than **200,000 soldiers**]{.mark} stationed in Iraq and [relied
on]{.mark} submarine [cable]{.mark} network[s]{.mark} for 95 per cent of
their strategic communications]{.underline}, including the use of
drones, [[critical for **surveillance** and]{.mark} [**counter-terror**
strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to Lieutenant Colonel Donald
Fielded of the 50th US Communications Squadron, while engineers
struggled to repair the cables, daily sorties fell from the hundreds to
"tens".

"[[These]{.mark} are]{.underline} definitely [[critical
infrastructure]{.mark}, both for finance and military
activity]{.underline}," says Bert Chapman, professor at Purdue
University and author of the report Undersea Cables: [[The **Ultimate
Geopolitical Chokepoint**. "Any attack]{.mark} on them [could have
a]{.mark} potentially **[decapitating effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

### Cables\-\--Impact\-\--AT: No Outages\-\--2AC

**Undersea cables are the [backbone]{.underline} of the global internet.
Cutting them [wrecks]{.underline} connectivity.**

Robin **Chataut 24**, Assistant Professor at Texas Christian
University\'s Department of Computer Science, \"Undersea cables are the
unseen backbone of the global internet\",
https://theconversation.com/undersea-cables-are-the-unseen-backbone-of-the-global-internet-226300,
4-1-2024//ILake-AW

[[Undersea cables]{.underline}]{.mark}, also known as submarine
communications cables, are fibre-optic cables laid on the ocean floor
and used to [transmit data **between continents**]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} cables [[are the **backbone**]{.underline} [of the
**global internet**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [carrying]{.underline} [the
bulk of international communications]{.underline}, including email,
webpages and video calls. [[More than **95 per cent** of all]{.mark} the
[data]{.mark} that moves]{.underline} [around the world]{.underline}
[[goes through these]{.underline}]{.mark} undersea cables.

These [[cables]{.underline}]{.mark} are capable of
[transmitting]{.underline} [multiple terabits]{.underline} of data [per
second]{.underline}, [[offering the **fastest**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
most reliable [[method of data transfer]{.underline}]{.mark} available
today. A terabit per second is fast enough to transmit about a dozen
two-hour, 4K HD movies in an instant. Just one of these cables can
handle millions of people watching videos or sending messages
simultaneously without slowing down.

About 485 undersea cables totaling over 900,000 miles sit on the ocean
floor. These cables span the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as
strategic passages such as the Suez Canal and isolated areas within
oceans.

Laying cable under the sea

Each undersea cable contains multiple optical fibres, thin strands of
glass or plastic that use light signals to carry vast amounts of data
over long distances with minimal loss. The fibres are bundled and
encased in protective layers designed to withstand the harsh undersea
environment, including pressure, wear and potential damage from fishing
activities or ship anchors. The cables are typically as wide as a garden
hose.

The process of laying undersea cables starts with thorough seabed
surveys to chart a map in order to avoid natural hazards and minimise
environmental impact. Following this step, cable-laying ships equipped
with giant spools of fibre-optic cable navigate the predetermined route.

As the ship moves, the cable is unspooled and carefully laid on the
ocean floor. The cable is sometimes buried in seabed sediments in
shallow waters for protection against fishing activities, anchors and
natural events. In deeper areas, the cables are laid directly on the
seabed.

Along the route, repeaters are installed at intervals to amplify the
optical signal and ensure data can travel long distances without
degradation. This entire process can take months or even years,
depending on the length and complexity of the cable route.

Threats to undersea cables

[[Each year]{.underline}]{.mark}, an estimated 100 to 150 [[undersea
cables are **cut**]{.underline}]{.mark}, primarily accidentally [[by
fishing]{.mark} equipment or **[anchors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However,
the [[potential for **sabotage**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly [by
nation-states, [is]{.mark} a **[growing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[concern]{.underline}. These [[cables]{.underline}]{.mark}, [crucial for
**global connectivity**]{.underline} and owned by consortia of internet
and telecom companies, often [[lie in]{.mark} isolated]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} publicly [[known locations]{.underline}, [making them
**easy targets**]{.underline}]{.mark} for hostile actions.

The [vulnerability]{.underline} was [highlighted by]{.underline}
unexplained [[**failures** in]{.underline}]{.mark} multiple [[cables
off]{.underline}]{.mark} the coast of [[West Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}
on March 14, 2024, [which [led to **significant internet
disruptions**]{.mark}]{.underline} affecting at least 10 nations.
Several cable failures in the Baltic Sea in 2023 raised suspicions of
sabotage.

[The]{.underline} strategic [[Red Sea]{.mark} corridor]{.underline} has
[[emerged as a **focal point** for]{.mark} undersea [cable
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [A]{.underline} notable
[[incident]{.underline} [involved]{.underline}]{.mark} the attack on the
cargo ship Rubymar by [[Houthi rebels]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
subsequent [damage to undersea cables]{.underline} [from
the]{.underline} [ship's anchor]{.underline} not only
[[disrupted]{.mark} a [**significant portion** of internet
traffic]{.mark}]{.underline} between Asia and Europe [but]{.underline}
also [highlighted the complex interplay]{.underline} [between
**geopolitical conflicts** and the **security** of **global internet
infrastructure**]{.underline}.

#### It risks catastrophic internet outages.

**CB \'24** \[Cassie B.; writer for NewsTarget; 14 November, 2024;
\"Undersea internet cable sabotage could unleash a worldwide disaster,\"
NewsTarget,

Is the world's internet -- and all of our daily activities that depend
on it -- in jeopardy? [Numerous [**world leaders** are accusing]{.mark}
[one another of planning to **cut**]{.mark} the [undersea
**cables**]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [responsible for delivering
global internet traffic [to **wreak**]{.mark} widespread
**[havoc]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[With some of these [cables]{.mark} spanning from one continent to
another, protecting them is challenging]{.underline}, and
[this]{.underline} is something that [[could be]{.underline}]{.mark}
easily [[taken advantage of]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is reasonable to
expect that [[if one]{.mark} world [**superpower** is]{.mark} the
**[victim]{.mark}** of this]{.underline} type of [attack, [they
could]{.mark} seek to [cut]{.mark} the undersea [cables their enemies
use]{.mark}]{.underline} to stay online, [[leading to a **broad internet
outage**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Most of the world's internet]{.underline} traffic [travels across
a]{.underline}n expansive [network of high-speed fiber optic cables
situated along the ocean floor, and [attacking]{.mark}]{.underline} it
[[could disrupt **government** and **military** communications]{.mark}
[as well as **private**]{.mark} ones, [causing problems fo]{.mark}r
everything from [**energy suppliers** to **financial
markets**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[This isn't]{.underline} just [hypothetical]{.underline}; CNN recently
reported that [American [officials have been **sounding the alarm**
over]{.mark} "[increased Russian military activity]{.mark}]{.underline}
around key underseas cables."

According to the news outlet, two [[American officials told them]{.mark}
that [Russia]{.mark} [has been working hard]{.mark} on a unit that would
disable this vital]{.underline} part of global communication
[infrastructure]{.underline}.

["[**Russia** is continuing to develop **naval capabilities**
for]{.mark} undersea **[sabotage]{.mark}**]{.underline} mainly thru
GUGI, a closely guarded unit that operates surface vessels, submarines
and naval drones," one official said, referring to the Russian acronym
for the country's "General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research"
unit.

The threat is so concerning that [the U.S. routinely tracks Russian
ships that patrol near critical undersea cables]{.underline} and
infrastructure. [The seas of Northern Europe seem to be a particular
focus]{.underline} for Russia, with a joint investigation by public
broadcasters from Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark reporting that
[[Russia was operating a fleet of]{.mark} suspected **[spy
ships]{.mark}**]{.underline} there [with a view to sabotaging undersea
cables]{.underline} as well as wind farms.

However, the Russians claim that they are not planning such an attack
and that the true culprits are the U.S. and the U.K.

According to the Telegram channel Crimean Wind, Putin aide Nikolai
Patrushev said that Western accusations of Russian sabotage "would be
funny, but such statements often sound like a cover for their own
intentions."

[**[China]{.mark}** also appears to be [exploring the
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}, with American and Taiwanese forces
observing the Chinese Navy in waters near Taiwan in activity that has
been characterized as a potential preparation for cutting Taiwan off
entirely.

[[Dependence]{.mark} on undersea cables has [left us
**vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline}

While many people think the internet is fully wireless given the
prevalence of wireless devices in modern times, [almost all internet
traffic depends on the fiber optics laid across the ocean
floor]{.underline}. These [[cables]{.underline}]{.mark} are vital for
everyday life around the world, [[facilitating **99% of internet
traffic**]{.mark}, along with data transfers]{.underline} and phone
calls.

[They are also **[vulnerable to
accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline} involving fishing and anchors. In 2017,
[a ship]{.underline} accidentally [severed a submarine]{.underline}
telecommunication [cable]{.underline} off the Somalian coast. The
incident ended up **[[costing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the country
[[**\$10 million a day** and]{.mark} resulted in [a **three-week
internet outage**. The effects on a bigger]{.mark}]{.underline} and more
modern [[country would be]{.underline}]{.mark} even [more
**[dramatic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[An [American official said]{.mark}]{.underline} that [if
[Russia]{.mark} were to [sabotage]{.mark} underseas infrastructure, it
[would b]{.mark}e considered [a **major
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} and handled accordingly.

"[Any [activities that damaged]{.mark}]{.underline} seabed
infrastructure including [undersea [cables]{.mark}]{.underline}
especially [[during]{.underline}]{.mark} [periods of heightened
[tensions risks **misunderstandings** and **misperceptions**]{.mark}
that could lead to]{.underline} unintended [escalation]{.underline}. The
US would be especially concerned about damage to our or our allies'
critical undersea infrastructure," the official said.

From downed payment systems to supply chain disruptions and essential
goods shortages, [[the **effects** would be **devastating**]{.mark}.
Transportation networks, [**power grids** and **water networks**]{.mark}
could all [be impacted]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sadly, [we've become so
dependent on connectivity that [we're]{.mark} just [a **few dozen
cut**]{.mark} [**cables** away]{.mark} from one of
[the **biggest**]{.mark} **[economic disaster]{.mark}s**[ in
history]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[**Continuing incidents**, backed by **Russia** and the
**PRC**]{.underline}, [that undermine **alliance

acceptable behavior also [demonstrate]{.underline} [that past responses
have been **insufficient**.]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} policy
[holds that an]{.underline} [attack against critical

**fall short**]{.underline} of this [may be deemed]{.underline} [as
**weak** by adversaries **testing the boundaries**]{.underline} of
tacitly accepted behavior, [thereby **undermining
deterrence**]{.underline}. With this in mind, NATO must enhance its
ability to attribute and condemn attacks. Alliance members should also
consider expanding NATO response options and enhance SACEUR's authority
to quickly respond to threats against CUI. This could include a stronger
and better resourced maritime readiness force following the model of the
VJTF. NATO should also help its members coordinate announcements on
actions allies may take in response to incidents in their EEZs. Such
actions include the right to board a vessel suspected of damaging
undersea cables.

### Cables\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Econ Collapse\-\--2AC

#### Cable disruptions [collapse]{.underline} financial institutions

Elisabeth **Braw 7/14**, \[The writer is a senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council and advises Gallos Technologies\], 7-14-2025, \"Financial
institutions should prepare for subsea cable sabotage\", Financial
Times, https://www.ft.com/content/cf16a5b4-6961-4b6c-80fb-6238b73338bd
// shaka

[A string of mysterious [undersea cable incidents]{.mark} is
**[spook]{.mark}**ing [governments and]{.mark} Nato. But they should
spook another group too: the [financial]{.mark} services [industry. If
several cables]{.mark} connecting Britain or the US east coast [were
severed]{.mark}, the City of London and [Wall Street would face
**colossal disruption**]{.mark} and losses. Both London and New York
should prepare for it.]{.underline}

[On Christmas Day last year, the Cook Islands-flagged tanker [Eagle S
hit five cables in]{.mark} the Gulf of [Finland. Had]{.mark} the
[Finnish]{.mark} Border Guard [not boarded the tanker]{.mark}, which
belongs to Russia's so-called shadow fleet, the [destruction could have
been]{.mark} even [worse]{.mark}.]{.underline} The cables' operators
closely followed the developments --- and so did Jaakko Weuro, the head
of Finland's Financial Stability Authority (RVV).

[RVV, established in 2015 to protect taxpayers from the **effects of
financial crises** and to **prevent financial crises**, is not in charge
of undersea infrastructure. But money travels through the world's more
than 500 data cables --- some \$10tn of it every single
day.]{.underline}

[Weuro knew that [if]{.mark} the [Eagle S]{.mark} had [hit more cables
before]{.mark} the Border [Guard intervened, Finland's financial
stability could have been **shaken**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since 2022,
Finland has been working to set up a rudimentary system ensuring
payments in case of a blackout.

[But most [other countries don't even have a Finnish-style backup. **"We
need the cables,"**]{.mark} Weuro told me. "**We can't replace them with
satellites."** Compared to undersea cables, satellites are costly and
cumbersome. No wonder the workhorses of the ocean carry 99 per cent of
all internet traffic, including virtually all financial
transactions.]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} the [cable]{.mark} system [fails]{.mark}, what do we do?
There is no clear answer.]{.underline} London and New York, too, are
profoundly dependent on the cables. The coasts off these two cities just
happen to be hubs for the cables connecting the UK with Europe and the
east coast of the US with Europe, which makes them even more attractive
for sabotage.

Undersea cables use a redundancy model: if one cable is damaged, its
"twin" automatically takes over its traffic. [But what would happen if a
whole string of cables were damaged at the same time? Even a disruption
of a few minutes [would cause **massive damage to financial
institutions.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Who would pay]{.mark} for the loss [if]{.mark}, say, [a £100mn
transaction were halted]{.mark} because a mysterious ship hit the cable
**executing the transaction** and the backup cable had been damaged too?
Under the best of circumstances, repairing a data cable takes several
days.]{.underline}

Banking bosses in London and New York should demonstrate preparedness
for a cable outage much as they prepare contingency plans for a major
cyber attack or another global financial crisis. We stress-test for the
latter two; the Bank of England conducts the industry-wide SIMEX
exercises involving infrastructure faults demanding a reset, and the US
Sheltered Harbor allows banks to maintain basic operations after a cyber
incident.

[But in the event of a subsea cable outage, we would --- so to speak ---
be at sea. "Money affected by a cable outage might not be ultimately
lost, but it could **distort the market**," Weuro
reflected]{.underline}. "There would be winners and losers. [[What if a
bank loses so much money]{.mark} that [it **imperils**]{.mark} the
viability of the [country's financial system?]{.mark} And because we
don't have experience with such an event, we [don't know how long it
would take to recover]{.mark} and how to plan for such an
event."]{.underline} In the meantime, he continues to build Finland's
Plan B.

[[Planning how to respond]{.mark} to such devastation in both hubs of
the global financial system [is **essential**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
would have to involve not just banks but governments, cable operators,
underwriters and cable-repair firms too. Those who prepare will be
better off than those who don't.

Outside the planetary boundaries: the weight of agrifood

[Agriculture]{.underline} [and food systems]{.underline} (hereinafter,
'agrifood') are both drivers and victims of these disruptions.
Agriculture is [responsible for]{.underline} a
**[significant]{.underline}** portion of [GHG emissions]{.underline},
including a majority of non-CO2 emissions. The [global]{.underline}
[agrifood]{.underline} chain, as whole, is [estimated]{.underline} [to
contribute]{.underline} between 21% and [**37%** of total net
anthropogenic GHGs]{.underline}3 Source: J. Lokrantz/Azote based on
Steffen et al. 2015. majority of water resources on Earth.4 The
[agrifood chain is thus one of the **key battlefields**]{.underline} [in
mankind's]{.underline} [struggle]{.underline} [for a **more sustainable
future**]{.underline}. Excessive and [unsustainable use of
land]{.underline} resources, in particular, [determines growing
imbalances]{.underline}: land degradation has reduced the productivity
of 23% of the global land surface, and in 2015 [33% of marine **fish
stocks**]{.underline} were [being harvested]{.underline} at
unsustainable levels. Up to [400 million tonnes of **heavy
metals**]{.underline} solvents, [**toxic sludge** and other
wastes]{.underline} [from industrial facilities are dumped
annually]{.underline} into the world's waters, and fertilisers entering
coastal ecosystems have [produced]{.underline} more than [400 ocean
'**dead zones'**]{.underline}, totalling more than 245,000 km2
(591-595), a combined area greater than that of the United Kingdom. As
observed by Rolnick et al. (2019), much of modern-day agriculture is
dominated by monoculture, the practice of producing a single crop on a
large swath of land. [Farmers]{.underline} to [manage]{.underline} their
[fields with]{.underline} tractors and other [basic automated
tools]{.underline}, [which **strips** the soil of
**nutrients**]{.underline} [and reduces productivity]{.underline}. As a
result, many [farmers rely]{.underline} heavily [on
nitrogen]{.underline}-based [fertilisers]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} can [convert into nitrous]{.underline}
[oxide]{.underline}, a [greenhouse gas **300 times more potent** than
carbon dioxide]{.underline}. It is estimated that [agriculture
contributes]{.underline} a staggering [**58%** of nitrous oxide to
global GHGs.]{.underline}

Rockström et al. (2009) introduced the concepts of 'planetary
boundaries' and a 'safe operating space for humanity', which have more
recently been revised by Steffen et al. (2015). The **[planetary
boundaries]{.underline}** are intended to [represent Earth system
processes]{.underline}, which, [if crossed]{.underline},
[could]{.underline} generate unacceptable environmental change
potentially **[endangering human existence]{.underline}**. The nine
planetary boundaries currently recognised are land system change;
freshwater use; biogeochemical cycles (nitrogen and phosphorous);
biosphere integrity; climate change; ocean acidification; stratospheric
ozone depletion; atmospheric aerosol loading; and introduction of novel
entities. Although the approach has been criticised in various ways, it
provides a useful way of looking at the limits of the Anthropocene, and
the thresholds that should not be breached if humans want to preserve
the sustainability of the planet.

Campbell et al. (2017) observe that [two planetary
boundaries]{.underline} [are at high risk]{.underline} ([**biosphere
integrity** and **biogeochemical flows**]{.underline}) and
[agriculture]{.underline} has [been the **major driver** of
this]{.underline} trend. Two are in a zone of uncertainty i.e. at
increasing risk, with agriculture a major driver of one of them (land
system change) and a major contributor to the other (climate change).
Agriculture is also a significant or major contributor to change for
many of those planetary boundaries still in the safe zone. [To reduce
the role of agriculture in transgressing planetary
boundaries]{.underline}, many [actions]{.underline} [will be
needed]{.underline}, including those [related to **agrifood
systems**]{.underline}.

Our understanding of planetary boundaries is however still very limited.
For example, Rockström et al. (2009) suggested that no more than 15% of
the Earth's ice-free surface should be converted to cropland. Since
then, several other studies have reached similar estimates (12.6-15.2%
of terrestrial area). Today, "more than a third of the world's land
surface and nearly 75% of freshwater resources are now devoted to crop
or livestock production". However, more recent research has shown that
the estimated sustainability thresholds should be revised to account for
the impact on biodiversity. Usubiaga-Liaño et al. (2019) find that a
maximum of 4.6-11.2% of the global ice-free land can be allocated to
cropland (and 7.9-15.7% to pasture) to meet biodiversity constraints.

[The quest for improving]{.underline} [agricultural
productivity]{.underline} [is a cause of **instability**]{.underline}
[and **land disruption**]{.underline}. Intensive agriculture and the
[massive use of **pesticides**]{.underline} are key [causes of
plummeting **biodiversity**]{.underline}, and [this]{.underline} in turn
[makes]{.underline} the [land]{.underline} more [vulnerable to
contamination]{.underline}, thereby [creating]{.underline} more
likelihood of [diseases]{.underline}. For example, a recent paper
published by the journal Biological Conservation reviews 73 existing
studies from around the world published over the past 13 years, finding
that declines in almost all regions may lead to the extinction of 40% of
insects over the next few decades. [This may heavily]{.underline}
[affect the food chain, and]{.underline} may [alter living
conditions]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [many species]{.underline} of
birds, reptile, fish. Pastor et al. (2019) recall that [by
**2050**]{.underline}, without major policy interventions, human water
use and irrigated areas are [expected to **increase
rapidly**]{.underline} [due to population growth]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} an increase in [food demands]{.underline}; but at the
same time, **[crop yields]{.underline}** [are projected to
**decrease**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} more than
[**80%**]{.underline} in some areas [under the]{.underline}
highest-emission [climate scenario]{.underline}, [which is hard to
reconcile]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the [imperative to **increase
land use**]{.underline} [to meet the needs of a population that may hit
**10 billion** by 2050.]{.underline}

The need for a Great Food Transformation

[Food is at the **core** of]{.underline} all [these
developments]{.underline}. And it is in food production, distribution
and consumption that the most evident and detrimental inconsistencies
are to be found. Food consumption, according to the United Nations, is
impacting the climate in many ways. [A third of the food]{.underline}
[produced]{.underline} in the world [each year]{.underline}
(approximately 1.3 billion tonnes at an economic cost of \$940 billion
to farmers, companies, and consumers) [is]{.underline} lost or
[wasted]{.underline}: wasted food is [responsible for roughly 8% of
global emissions]{.underline}. As recently reported by the EAT-Lancet
Commission (2019), "unhealthy and unsustainably produced food poses a
global risk to people and the planet". Importantly, [there are more than
**820 million people** that have insufficient food]{.underline}, but
many more consume a diet that is so unhealthy that it contributes to
severe health complications and premature death. [Global food production
is]{.underline} defined as "[the **largest pressure**
caused]{.underline} [by humans on Earth]{.underline},
[threatening]{.underline} local ecosystems and the **[stability of the
Earth]{.underline}** system". Systems of food production release massive
amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere: this includes methane
and nitrous oxide, which have 56 times and 280 times the global warming
potential (over 20 years) of carbon dioxide, respectively.5

Some of these processes are at least partly inevitable, which suggests
that eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions related to food production
is not feasible. However, the [weight imposed by
agriculture]{.underline} [and global food]{.underline} production on the
planet [is such that fixing food means]{.underline} also **[saving the
planet]{.underline}**. According to the EAT-Lancet Commission, dietary
shifts are needed, including a greater than 50% reduction in global
consumption of red meat and sugar, and a greater than 100% increase in
consumption of nuts, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Such dietary
changes are expected to substantially benefit human health, averting
about 10.8-11.6 million deaths per year.

What is increasingly clear is that solving the 'food challenge' will
also lead to successfully addressing the climate challenge,
strengthening the awareness of the importance of "Fixing food" for the
sustainability of the planet (BCFN 2018). At the same time, healthy
diets from sustainable food systems are intertwined with all SDGs, and
require for example the provision of high-quality primary health care
that integrates family planning and education; as well as substantial
shifts towards healthy dietary patterns, large reductions in food losses
and waste, and major improvements in food production practices. A recent
IPCC Report on Climate Change and Land observed that the per capita
supply of vegetable oils and meat has more than doubled and the supply
of food calories per capita has increased by about one third since 1961.
By 2050, dietary changes could free up several million square kilometres
of land, and reduce global CO2 emissions by up to eight billion tonnes
per year, relative to business as usual.

Can technology push planetary boundaries?

Against the background of adverse demographics, and the worrying trends
of intensive agriculture, food production and consumption, other [trends
promise to **turn back the clock**]{.underline}. On the one hand, the
promise of specific technologies such as geo-engineering or carbon
capture and storage (which fall outside the scope of this report,
dedicated to digital technology) comes with threatening side effects in
terms of overall sustainability, and if anything exacerbates the
Anthropocene's vocation towards altering the natural course of events.

Conversely[, in the agrifood]{.underline} [sector]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [evolution of **digital technology**]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} [the potential to play a **major role** in
sustainabilit]{.underline}y. Key trends such as the [acceleration of
**computing power**]{.underline}, the emergence of [the]{.underline}
[Internet of Things (**IoT**)]{.underline}, the rise of [**5G**
connectivity]{.underline}, [**Distributed Ledger technologies**
(DLTs)]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, above all, sophisticated forms of
**[Artificial Intelligence]{.underline}** (AI) [promise]{.underline} [to
**shift planetary boundaries**]{.underline}, possibly remedying
situations that would otherwise appear to have become hopeless. As will
be explained in more detail below, modern AI techniques (especially when
coupled with robotics and the [Internet of Things]{.underline}) [can
lead to optimising]{.underline} [soil management]{.underline} and
[increasing **crop yields**]{.underline}, leading to an [optimised
matching of food **supply and demand**]{.underline}, massively [reducing
the use of **pesticides**]{.underline} and, with the help of adequate
data, governance and skills throughout the value chain, [empowering
farmers]{.underline} and consumers [to realise]{.underline} the full
promise of [the **Great Food Transformation**]{.underline}. Likewise,
[DLTs, cloud and edge computing]{.underline} [can achieve
unprecedented]{.underline}, trusted [control of]{.underline} the
integrity of **[value chains]{.underline}**. Again [AI]{.underline}, in
the form of interactive user interfaces such as conversational bots, and
[in combination with **connected devices**]{.underline},
[can]{.underline} transform the user experience and [lead to more
sustainable patterns of consumption]{.underline}, for example guiding
consumers towards healthier diets. And the power of peer-to-peer (P2P)
networks and the collaborative economy can lead to [massively
reducing]{.underline} the problem of [**food waste**.]{.underline}

The rise of the internet has changed the world in profound ways, some

SMART cables In 2012, three United Nations agencies --- the
International Telecommunication Union, the World Meteorological
Organization, and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of
UNESCO --- established the Joint Task Force, Science Monitoring and
Reliable Telecommunications, or SMART, Subsea Cables. This joint task
force is charged with investigating the use of submarine
telecommunications cables for ocean and climate monitoring and disaster
warning. The task force is chaired by Bruce Howe, Ph.D., a research
professor in the Department of Ocean and Resources Engineering within
the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University
of Hawaii at Manoa. Howe was the lead author of "SMART Subsea Cables for
Observing the Earth and Ocean, Mitigating Environmental Hazards, and
Supporting the Blue Economy," an article published Feb. 7 in the journal
*Frontiers in Earth Science*. Although complicated in nature, the issues
to be addressed as part of the design of the SMART subsea cables present
"no insurmountable engineering challenges," Howe says. Rather, the
various factors pose a "complex optimization problem" that must account
for such additional concerns as cost and the possibility of adding other
sensors to the systems in the future, he says. Multiple benefits

## Quantum\-\--Uniqueness

### Quantum\-\--U\-\--2AC

**The [quantum race]{.underline} is heating up, but [stagnating
investment]{.underline} risks the US [falling behind]{.underline}.**

Leadership Urges U.S., Allies to Double Down on Quantum\", Quantum
Insider,

[The United States]{.underline} [risks **falling behind** in
the]{.underline} emerging [race for **quantum supremacy**]{.underline}
[unless]{.underline} [it renews]{.underline} its focus on scientific
**[investment]{.underline}**, workforce development, and supply chain
security, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith warned in a post
published today.

While artificial intelligence dominates the technology spotlight, Smith
said in the Microsoft blog post that [quantum]{.underline} computing [is
moving from **theory into practice**]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
[potentially]{.underline} **[transformative consequences]{.underline}**
for science, medicine, energy, and national security.

"Long the domain of theory, [quantum]{.underline} technologies are
[edging closer to reality]{.underline}, [with **profound implications**
for the world and]{.underline} [American **national
competitiveness**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}**," Smith writes. "As basic research and
private sector advancements accelerate, a new global race is picking up
steam. [Now is the time for the United States]{.underline} and its
allies [to **double down** and invest]{.underline} [in their strengths
to claim the quantum frontier."]{.underline}

Countries including [China]{.underline} [have made quantum research
a]{.underline} strategic **[priority]{.underline}**, [forcing the United
States to act **decisively** to **maintain its lead**]{.underline},
according to the post.

Quantum technologies manipulate the fundamental behavior of particles at
the atomic level, offering the promise of solving problems that
overwhelm today's computers. A fully operational quantum computer could
simulate molecular interactions for drug development, optimize complex
logistics, and accelerate scientific discovery. Smith emphasized in the
blog post that advances like Microsoft's Majorana-based quantum chip,
which aims to reduce instability in qubits, could shorten the timeline
for practical quantum applications.

[U.S. Federal]{.underline} [Funding Faces **New Pressures**]{.underline}

Smith's post outlined a series of steps for safeguarding American
leadership, citing the nation's historical advantage boosted by two
critical engines of research and development.

"[For 80 years]{.underline}, American innovation has been driven by two
critical ingredients," Smith writes. "The first is basic research. The
second is private sector investment in product development by companies
of all sizes."

He noted that [U.S. innovation]{.underline} [has]{.underline} long
[relied on the combination of **government-backed**]{.underline}
[science]{.underline} programs [and **commercial development**
pipelines]{.underline} --- [a structure]{.underline} now [under strain
as rival]{.underline} [nations]{.underline} **[ramp up]{.underline}**
their own [quantum initiatives]{.underline}.

The warning comes as global investment in quantum technologies
accelerates.

[China]{.underline}, in particular, [has dramatically]{.underline}
[expanded public spending]{.underline} [on **research and
development**]{.underline} over the past two decades. Although exact
numbers are difficult to confirm, according to the blog post,
[China's]{.underline} [government has committed]{.underline}
approximately [**\$15 billion** to quantum]{.underline}
[projects]{.underline}, double the European Union's planned spending and
[eigh**t times higher**]{.underline} [than]{.underline} previous [U.S.
government allocations]{.underline}. Earlier this year, China launched a
\$138 billion venture fund aimed at bolstering high-risk research,
including quantum technologies.

Meanwhile, [U.S. federal funding]{.underline} [for quantum]{.underline}
research [has **stagnated**]{.underline}. [Although]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration's first term [saw the passage of the
National Quantum Initiative Act]{.underline} in 2018, Smith pointed out
that [proposed budgets for]{.underline} fiscal year [2025]{.underline}
under the Biden administration [**slightly decreased** quantum
allocations]{.underline} compared to earlier levels. Smith argues that
[the United States]{.underline} [**cannot afford** to]{.underline} [lose
momentum or face a "**strategic surprise**" in quantum
capabilities.]{.underline}

#### Trump's funding cuts are destroying private sector innovation

"The global quantum race is more than academic -- it is a competition
for 21st century technological supremacy with major implications for
America's economic strength and our national security," said committee
Chairman Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, in his opening statements.

Witnesses and lawmakers also warned that [[competing in that quantum
race will require investment]{.mark} from outside of the
government]{.underline} -- especially [[after]{.mark} recent [science
and technology **funding cuts** from the Trump]{.mark}
[administration]{.mark}.]{.underline}

["[The administration claims to support quantum]{.mark} research funding
in its budget proposal, [but]{.mark} in practice, [the president

Lofgren, D-Calif.

["I think [we're fooling ourselves if we think we can support quantum
leadership while helping to **destroy the workforce** that feeds

#### Neg evidence is false optimism\-\--further analysis proves China is dominating the quantum sphere

**Earl 23** \[Duncan Earl; May 8, 2023; Chief technology officer at
Qubitekk; "Why the US needs a 'quantum Oppenheimer' to beat China in the
quantum race";
https://physicsworld.com/a/why-the-us-needs-a-quantum-oppenheimer-to-beat-china-in-the-quantum-race/\]

[[The nation leading the race]{.mark} so far to **harness the power [of
quantum]{.mark} technologies** [is China]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
country has constructed a 2000 km quantum-secured fibre-optic network
and in 2017 demonstrated quantum-secured satellite communications. In
2019 and 2020 [[China's demonstration of "**quantum
advantage**"]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a critical threshold on the path to
powerful quantum computers -- [further [revealed]{.mark} a
[sophistication and acceleration of its quantum]{.mark}-information
programme.]{.underline}

In both political and scientific circles, [[some are quick to
dismiss]{.mark} China's recent [progress]{.mark}]{.underline}, viewing
Chinese publications with scepticism and asserting that the country is a
"paper tiger". [[Yet a closer examination of]{.mark} published
[Chinese]{.mark} quantum [research reveals]{.mark} a **level of
[detail]{.mark}, [results and collaboration]{.mark}** with western
researchers [that suggest **the tiger has teeth**]{.mark}. [The Chinese
are]{.mark} indeed **[prioritizing and dominating the quantum]{.mark}
[space]{.mark}**, [with]{.mark} every [intention of **winning
this**]{.mark} **technology [race]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

China's rapid progress is even more worrisome for the US when one
considers that America was well ahead of China in quantum technology at
the turn of the century. [This reversal has been attributed to **reduced
US federal funding** for quantum research between 2005 and
2015.]{.underline}

However, this explanation oversimplifies the US's failures and also does
not give China credit for its own advances. Inevitably, [the situation
is lamented in the US, with [concerns ranging from China developing a
quantum computer]{.mark} [capable of **cracking our**]{.mark} **most
secure [codes]{.mark}**, [to advanced Chinese **military**]{.mark} **and
industrial [capabilities]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} vastly [outpace our
own]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Given China's steady commitment and progress, the conversation in the US
must now turn to asking serious questions about our level of commitment
and about the need to create a timeline for accelerating the US quantum
programme. Such discussions must focus on near-term defence, industry
participation and policy actions that directly address the question: how
can the US catch -- and overtake -- China in the quantum race?

J. Robert Oppenheimer successfully exploited the revolutionary discovery
of quantum physics to provide decisive technological superiority to the
United States. In an echo of the past, [[the U.S. is now in **a race
with China** to]{.mark} [unlock]{.mark} the full potential of [quantum
tech]{.mark}nology.]{.underline}

Viewers of "Oppenheimer" will recognize parallels in the [current
contest over a critical technology with serious military
ramifications.]{.underline}

Writing for The Diplomat, national security analyst Sam Howell asserted,
"[[The first country to operationalize quantum]{.mark} technologies
[will]{.mark} possess a toolkit of [capabilities that can
overwhelm]{.mark} unprepared [adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[China]{.underline} likewise [recognizes the potential of quantum
technology]{.underline}. "Since [[China is]{.mark} already [invested
heavily in quantum]{.mark}]{.underline} technologies with a long-term
outlook," Navy Commander Doug Quinn and two colleagues wrote for Joint
Force Quarterly, "\[the Defense Department\] should assume that
\[[[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} computing\] [[poses a]{.mark} long-term
[threat]{.mark} to homeland defense]{.underline}."

The field of quantum technology covers a range of systems that interact
with matter at the subatomic level. At such small scales, the behavior
of matter and energy is strangely paradoxical.

[A quantum computer exploits]{.underline} those [unique properties to
perform calculations more efficiently]{.underline} than classical
computers, [allowing it to solve problems that are otherwise
impossibl]{.underline}y difficult for ordinary machines.

The development of [[quantum tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[has
**significant military applications**]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to
quantum physicist Michal Krelina, "Quantum technology does not bring
fundamentally new weapons or stand-alone military systems, but rather
significantly [enhances measurement capability, sensing, precision and
computation power, and efficiency]{.underline} of the current and future
military technology."

The [most pressing threat]{.underline} posed by hostile quantum power
[is to U.S. cybersecurity]{.underline}.

A sufficiently large quantum computer will be able to crack the
encryption algorithms that practically all computers currently use.
[Quantum]{.underline} computers [could be weaponized to
gain]{.underline} access to [sensitive classified information, private
industry systems, and critical infrastructure]{.underline}. Analysts
speculate that [[our adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[have already
begun]{.mark} collecting and [storing sensitive]{.mark} encrypted
[data]{.mark} [to decrypt once the]{.mark}]{.underline} necessary
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[is developed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Quantum computers are also expected to accelerate the development of
machine learning]{.underline} and artificial intelligence [for military
purposes]{.underline}. [Military applications]{.underline} for quantum
computing [range from logistics optimization to powering autonomous
weapons systems]{.underline}. The unique capabilities of [quantum
computers could also catalyze research in materials science, medicine,
and other defense-related fields.]{.underline}

Beyond computing, [[quantum tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[promises]{.underline}]{.mark} to offer a host of **[[futuristic
capabilities to the armed forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Extremely
sensitive and precise quantum sensors would revolutionize
intelligence]{.underline}, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities.

In fact, [China claims to have already developed a sensor]{.underline}
array that can detect magnetic field signatures from a submarine 5
kilometers away. [China leads in]{.underline} the development
of [quantum communication technology]{.underline}, which leverages the
laws of quantum physics to transfer data via signals that are impossible
to eavesdrop on.

The race for quantum supremacy is a struggle between private free
enterprise and state-directed communism. America has about 180 private
firms pursuing quantum computing, mostly on their own dime. Federal
funding on quantum science amounted to just over \$700 million in 2021,
spread out over a host of programs.

On the other hand, [the Chinese quantum sector is concentrated in
large-scale government-funded laboratories, with subsidies adding up
to more than \$15 billion. Analysts estimate that this is at least four
times as much as the U.S. quantum industry spends domestically per
year.]{.underline}

[[It's a **national security imperative** that the U.S. reach supremacy
in quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} computing and other technologies
[[before China]{.underline}]{.mark}, just as Oppenheimer did in his day
with Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.

#### Quantum is the center of [competition]{.underline}.

[[Quantum]{.mark} computers are [beginning to move]{.mark} from the
fringe]{.underline} of what was only once theoretically possible [[to
the center of a new]{.mark} technological [frontier of geopolitical
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Silicon Valley has unveiled
groundbreaking progress in recent months]{.underline}, with Microsoft,
Amazon Web Services and Google all announcing new quantum computing
chips. Despite potentially accelerating years-long timelines of
realizing an effective and scalable quantum computer, the harsh reality
is that theorists and developers are still quite far from this hopeful
target. 

Meanwhile, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China
recognize the potential revolutionary reach]{.underline} these computers
will introduce. [[Both countries have found themselves in another
high-stakes]{.mark} technology [competition]{.mark}]{.underline} that is
[[rooted in]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[fear]{.underline}]{.mark} of being
left behind [and paranoia]{.underline} of each other's intentions.

The CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, sent publicly traded quantum companies
through a rollercoaster ride in January when he said he believes quantum
computers are likely still up to two decades away. 

Jensen's comments seemed counterintuitive in light of the still
hot-off-the-press headlines made by big-tech giants. Inside the quantum
"bubble," optimism is contagious and new announcements are accompanied
with renewed hype. 

Looking more closely, however, the quantum chip developments made by
these industry-leading enterprises have not yet demonstrated real-world
applicability. There is not yet convincing evidence that these chips can
actually be used in quantum computers. 

Since its release in February, Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip has been
criticized by experts in the quantum field, who say that there is not
sufficient proof, as of yet, that the chip can perform the quantum
functions it is advertised to be capable of. Amazon's Ocelot chip is,
admittedly, still only a prototype and likely behind competing quantum
chip efforts. And Google's Willow chip, despite having completed a
function that would take a classical computer 10 septillion years to
crack, solved a calculation which has no real-world applications. 

The only real consensus that exists right now is that [the needle is
moving closer to the target]{.underline}, but by exactly how much
remains unknown.

These press releases further fuel [the [scientific competition that
exists between the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China]{.underline}.]{.mark} Just as
the Chinese firm DeepSeek shook the artificial intelligence landscape
with their new AI model, [big quantum announcements spook Chinese
stakeholders in their efforts to keep pace with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. [China]{.underline}, which [is home
to]{.underline} Jian-Wei Pan, [the "father of quantum
computing]{.underline}," has also become the subject of U.S. targeted
export controls on identified hardware components required to construct
quantum computers. Like semiconductors, [[quantum computers are
increasingly becoming a focal point of contention]{.mark}.]{.underline}
From the United States' standpoint, [there are fears that]{.underline}
without stringent export controls, [[Chinese quantum advances may equate
to national security risks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[This technological race is creating an environment of
suspicion]{.underline} and secrecy, and as a result [there are
increasing restrictions on opportunities to engage]{.underline} more
[cooperatively]{.underline}. 

Returning from a recent trip to China, I experienced firsthand the
effects of this tension. A colleague of mine in Beijing arranged a
face-to-face meeting for me with a representative in the Chinese
government. The meeting was arranged on a late Sunday evening in an
unmarked residential building in northern Beijing. Instructed to travel
via public taxi and to arrive alone, I could not help but wonder why
this meeting was disguised with such an unusual amount of secrecy and
discretion. Sitting in a windowless room, the government officials I
spoke with used pseudonyms, insisted the meeting be off the record, and
prohibited any electronics or writing utensils to even be in the same
room. Why there was such an unusual amount of secrecy during our meeting
that night, I believe, can only be explained with the risk psychology of
the broader geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers. 

While technological competition and arms races are not a new concept in
global politics, [there are many aspects of the China-U.S. race that are
proving to be unique]{.underline}, not the least of which is the
economic dependence they have on each other. 

But [quantum computers are a class of technology]{.underline} that is
still only on the horizon; their role in today's world is predominately
theoretical. [[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} arguably [[a window]{.mark}
of opportunity [to create]{.mark}]{.underline} a framework of
cooperative [[norms before the field develops into a
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} akin to a "Chip War," referencing Chris
Miller's best-seller on semiconductors. These frameworks have been used
before, most prominently with efforts to curb fentanyl and agreements to
act on common threats, such as climate change.

[[Barriers]{.underline}]{.mark} to cooperation [[will exist in]{.mark}
areas of [quantum]{.mark} computing [that involve national security and
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, like cryptography. But given the large
range of beneficial applications that quantum computers are poised to
offer society, cooperative frameworks should be negotiated and settled
to advance research in areas of medicine, agriculture, climate, and
more. 

Failure to do so risks escalating the continuing trend of locking both
countries into adversarial stances despite the longevity of the quantum
computer timeline. This will likely stifle overall innovation potential
and reduce responsible regulation for both the United States and China.
By the same token intense competition can spur innovation, of course,
but it should not be solely justified through popular public narrative
that the United States and China are bound for larger scale conflict.

Over the last several years, as rapid advances in artificial
intelligence have gained enormous public attention and critical
scrutiny, another crucial technology has been evolving largely out of
public view. Once confined to the province of abstract theory, [quantum
computing seeks to use]{.underline} operations based on [quantum
mechanics to crack computational problems that were
previously]{.underline} considered [unsolvable]{.underline}. Although
the technology is still in its infancy, [it is already clear that
[quantum computing could have profound implications for national
security and the global economy]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in the
decades to come.

Since the late 2010s, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} many
[[other]{.underline}]{.mark} advanced [countrie[s]{.mark} [have
become]{.mark} increasingly [involved in the **race for leadership in
quantum**]{.mark}]{.underline} information science and [technology, a
field [that encompasses]{.mark} quantum computing, quantum
communications, and [quantum sensing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Over the last
decade, governments in [20 countries have announced investments in
quantum development]{.underline} totaling more than \$40 billion
worldwide; [[China]{.mark} alone [has committed]{.mark} to spend [\$15.3
billion]{.mark} over five years]{.underline}. In 2016, [[Beijing
designated]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of [[quantum]{.mark}
technologies]{.underline} as [a **[national priority]{.mark}**, and it
has created advanced hubs for production]{.underline}. For its part, the
United States, in 2018, enacted the National Quantum Initiative,
legislation aimed at maintaining the country's technological and
scientific lead in quantum information and its applications. The U.S.
government has announced \$3.7 billion in unclassified funding, plus
more funding for defense research and development. In addition to
government-led initiatives, multiple research and development efforts
are underway in the private sector and academia.

Although these investments are still dwarfed by U.S. and international
funding for AI, the rise of quantum technology has already begun to
shape international policy. In 2019, the United States announced a
bilateral "statement on quantum cooperation" with Japan, which the U.S.
government strengthened in 2023. And in 2024, Washington established a
multilateral initiative called the Quantum Development Group to
coordinate strategies for advancing and managing the new technology. The
United States has also discussed quantum issues within various economic
and security forums, including AUKUS, the trilateral defense pact among
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; the Quad, or
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, among Australia, India, Japan, and the
United States; and the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.
[Underscoring the growing concerns]{.underline} [about the
technology]{.underline} in Washington, one analyst for the Center for a
New American Security argued in November, following the U.S.
presidential election, that [the]{.underline} incoming [administration
must "act quickly]{.underline} during the first 100 days [to
reinvigorate America's quantum competitiveness]{.underline}."

Thus far, the advent of [quantum tech]{.underline}nology [has been
perceived]{.underline} largely [as a **national security
issue**]{.underline}. Since the 1990s, [researchers have
recognized]{.underline} that [one of [the]{.mark} [greatest
threat]{.mark}s posed by a powerful quantum computer [is its
potential]{.mark}]{.underline} as a code-breaking tool[, capable [of
penetrating the encryption]{.mark} used by the most advanced
communication systems]{.underline} and digital networks around the world
today. This concern has spurred the U.S. government to develop and
advocate for the adoption of quantum-resistant cryptography, strengthen
export controls on quantum technology and related products, and build
action-oriented partnerships with industry, academia, and local
governments.

But the focus on code breaking has led policymakers to ignore other
important applications of quantum technology. In fact, before quantum
machines are able to crack advanced encryption systems---a capability
that will require enormous computational power even after the technology
is developed---[they could have a transformational effect in many
sectors of the economy]{.underline}, including energy and
pharmaceuticals. Effectively harnessed, [[quantum]{.mark} technologies
[could spur innovation, scientific discovery, economic growth, and
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}. In sheer human impact, some of the
breakthroughs that could be unlocked by quantum machines rival those
that are now projected to come from AI. For this reason, it is
especially important that the technology is developed in open societies,
with clear guardrails in place to ensure that it is used for benevolent
purposes.

[[Winning the **quantum race will not be easy**]{.mark}. [China has
already taken the lead in some areas]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
quantum communications, and in the coming years, [focused [American
innovation and **leadership will be critical** to maintain]{.mark} U.S.
[competitiveness. The U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its international partners [will need
to commit]{.underline} far [more]{.underline} resources [to bring their
quantum projects to fruition]{.underline}, and [they [will have to
develop quantum industries]{.mark} and a strong quantum supply
chain]{.underline} to support these projects. [[If the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its allies
[[fail to make]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[efforts
a]{.underline}]{.mark} central strategic goal and [[**policymaking
priority**, they could lose diplomatic influence, military]{.mark}
[might, and]{.mark}]{.underline} the ability to provide [[oversight of
a]{.underline}]{.mark} powerful [[new tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology.
[[They could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[miss out
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the chance to forge [[a]{.mark} new [path for
economic and societal progress]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Quantum\-\--Leadership\-\--2AC

**The race determines the [global balance of power]{.underline}.**

Pakistan, is a researcher and socio-political analyst focusing on the
nexus between domestic and global politics, \"Why US-China quantum race
is the most critical contest of our time\",

[On top]{.underline} of [technological]{.underline}
[supremacy]{.underline}, [the quantum race could
**reshape**]{.underline} the very nature of [**international relations**
and **global power dynamics**]{.underline}

[Imagine a world]{.underline} [where]{.underline} encrypted [data is
**no longer secure**]{.underline}, [medical]{.underline} [advancements
are **accelerating** and governments compete for]{.underline} [power in
an **unseen realm**]{.underline}. [The race for quantum]{.underline}
supremacy [is]{.underline} not science fiction but rather [the **most
critical battleground** of our time]{.underline}.

At the heart of this contest are [China and the United
States]{.underline}, which [are investing **billions**]{.underline} [to
secure quantum supremac]{.underline}y[.]{.underline} The stakes extend
far beyond scientific innovation, [dictating]{.underline} [the future of
**national security**, economic power and **global
influence**.]{.underline}

The quantum technology race pits the market-driven innovation of the US
against China\'s state-directed strategy, with global dominance at
stake. While [China has invested **US\$15 billion**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [quantum research]{.underline} and development
[through]{.underline} direct [state funding]{.underline}, [the US relies
on]{.underline} a more dispersed but possibly more dynamic ecosystem
which combines [**public** and **private sector**
capabilities]{.underline}. These [differing approaches]{.underline}
[will shape]{.underline} the [race for]{.underline} quantum [dominance
and]{.underline} redefine the [**global balance of power**.]{.underline}

China\'s focus on quantum technology is consistent with its overall
strategic objectives, notably in information security. Beijing\'s US\$10
billion investment in the National Laboratory for Quantum Information
Sciences in Hefei, Anhui province, highlights its commitment to quantum
leadership. [Chinese researchers]{.underline} [achieved a
**record-breaking** 1,200km quantum communication]{.underline} [link via
the Micius satellite]{.underline}, [the world\'s first quantum
communication satellite]{.underline}. These innovations directly
[contribute to]{.underline} China\'s [strategic goals in military
communications and cybersecurity]{.underline}, [potentially
changing]{.underline} the balance of power in **[future
conflicts]{.underline}**.

However, the US innovation ecosystem has particular benefits that should
not be overlooked. [US technology]{.underline} [giants such as IBM,
Google and Microsoft]{.underline} have [accomplished quantum
breakthroughs]{.underline}, while a thriving start-up culture and
world-class research institutions encourage varied approaches to quantum
difficulties. This [distributed innovation]{.underline} paradigm has
historically [demonstrated]{.underline} greater **[resilience and
creativity]{.underline}** than centrally operated alternatives.

Meanwhile, China\'s strong reliance on state guidance has both
advantages and disadvantages. While government support has quickened
development and permitted long-term planning, it risks unintentionally
limiting organic innovation, which often results from market rivalry and
private sector initiatives. The US benefits from a more balanced
strategy, which combines significant government support with strong
private-sector investment and academic research.

In the global patent landscape, [China]{.underline} has
[established]{.underline} a [strong position in]{.underline}
[quantum]{.underline}-related [patents]{.underline},
[demonstrating]{.underline} its **[relentless pursuit]{.underline}** of
the protection of intellectual property. However, raw patent numbers do
not provide a complete picture. The quality and commercial feasibility
of patents, as well as their practical application potential, continue
to be critical elements in determining true technological leadership.

Traditional US strengths in scientific research and commercial
innovation provide significant advantages. The country\'s network of
top-tier institutions, national laboratories and technology companies
fosters innovative discoveries and practical applications. This
ecosystem has a long history of successfully turning scientific
advancements into commercial products and services, which is crucial in
the quantum domain.

Despite its strengths, however, [the US faces **significant
challenges**]{.underline} [in maintaining]{.underline} [its competitive
edge.]{.underline} [The shortage]{.underline} of [quantum]{.underline}
engineering **[talent]{.underline}**, the [demand for **long-term
financing**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [complexities of
**coordinating efforts**]{.underline} across various stakeholders all
[pose challenges to advancement]{.underline}. Moreover, [the openness of
US research]{.underline} institutes [raises]{.underline} [questions
about]{.underline} [intellectual property]{.underline} protection and
technology transfer.

[The stakes in]{.underline} the [quantum]{.underline} race extend far
beyond US-China rivalry, [holding **global implications** for
cybersecurity, economics and science]{.underline}. Quantum computing\'s
[potential to break]{.underline} modern [encryption]{.underline} could
**[revolutionise]{.underline}** data security and [intelligence
gathering]{.underline}, [giving an]{.underline} [**unmatched edge**
to]{.underline} the first [nation to achieve it.]{.underline}
Additionally, applications in financial modelling, medical research and
climate simulations promise transformative economic benefits.

[[China has]{.mark} already [taken]{.mark} the [lead in quantum

two-thousand-kilometer long quantum communication pathway from Beijing
to Shanghai.]{.underline} Given its heavy investment in future quantum
technology, including quantum computers, and its commitment to gaining
quantum supremacy as a national strategy priority, [it seems inevitable
that China [will]{.mark} move into the lead as this technology becomes
more widespread.]{.underline} This is true not only in the realm of
weaponization of quantum as discussed above, but also in establishing
global standards and practices for future quantum networks and
communications. [The [gains]{.mark} in terms [of economic and

It is time for our leaders, and the public, to understand the stakes of
quantum computing. What is unfolding every day at corporate, university,
and government laboratories around the world is more than a scientific
advance of enormous proportions and consequences. It will also determine
the geopolitics of the future.

[In the end, the [Manhattan Project]{.mark} didn't just win a world war;

[[Quantum tech]{.mark}nology (QT) [is]{.mark} an emergent and
[potentially **disruptive**]{.mark} ﬁeld that tends [to]{.mark} impact
many [human activities]{.mark}. Quantum technology covers many areas,
mainly quantum computing, quantum networks, quantum sensing and quantum
imaging.]{.underline} The common feature of all quantum technologies is
exploiting quantum properties of individual quantum-mechanical systems
(an electron, ion, atom, molecule etc.) such as quantum superposition, 1
quantum entanglement, 2 and quantum tunnelling. 3 Such technological use
of decades-old quantum physics is called the second quantum revolution.4

Quantum technologies' Technology Readiness Levels 5 (TRLs) cover the
full range from theory to commercially available technology.
Nevertheless, quantum technologies with the highest expectations are
rather at lower TRL around 5 (technology validated in the lab). Even a
low TRL does not hinder large industrial and governmental interests,
sometimes leading to hype and exaggerated expectations.

The expected use of quantum technologies covers, for instance, new
material and drug discoveries, better medical imaging systems, improved
machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence, underground oil and
minerals detection, unhackable cryptography, and optimised healthcare,
transportation and supply chains (see reviews in Bruß/Leuchs 2019;
Ezrat- ty 2021). [Of course, quantum technology will also bring
applications with military and security 6 impacts, such as quantum
cryptoanalysis, inertial navigation, radio-frequency antennas, and many
more (Krelina 2021) that can potentially impact all domains of modern
warfare.]{.underline}

[Disruption from QTs [could **concern military stability as well as
international security and peace**]{.mark}. A situation between
potential enemies is stable if neither side could gain from beginning a
war, in particular by a nuclear ﬁrst strike.]{.underline} A special
aspect is crisis stability -- it exists if a pre-emptive attack could
not markedly diminish second-strike forces so that both are deterred
from it. The second dimension of stability relates to arms racing. These
concepts are explained and have been studied with respect to military
applications of artiﬁcial intelligence and the risk of nuclear war (e.
g. Geist/Lohn 2018; Boulanin et al. 2020), and references therein. We
use the term international security in the traditional sense, namely
freedom of states from threats of external aggression (achieved maybe by
cooperation, maybe by deterrence); there are wider notions of security
and how to achieve it (e. g. Jackson 2020). Peace in a negative sense
means the absence of war; positive peace includes an absence of
structural violence within societies (e. g. Hancock/Solomon 2020). We
note that the UN has as its ﬁrst purpose "\[t\]o maintain international
peace and security," Article 1 Charter of the United Nations.7

In principle, similar to artiﬁcial intelligence and other emerging
technologies (Altmann 2020a, 2020b; Kubiak/Mishra/Stacey 2021), quantum
technologies could have drastic consequences on military stability and
thus international security and peace (e. g. Kubiak 2020). [[Breaking
comm]{.mark}unication codes [for military command and control could
allow surprise attacks]{.mark}. A [capability to detect and locate
nuclear]{.mark} ballistic-missile [submarines and]{.mark} mobile
[i]{.mark}nter[c]{.mark}ontinental [b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issiles
in real time [would open]{.mark} the [possibility of a **disarming ﬁrst
strike**, preventing a second strike]{.mark} so that this deterrent
could no longer be relied on. In a severe crisis, the temptation for
such attacks could rise. Even more urgently, the [lack of information
could drive worst-case assumptions, and the fear of such attacks could
create motives for pre-emption that would start a **devastating nuclear
war**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Over the last decade [**[Quantum]{.mark}** Technologies]{.underline}
(QT) have [[**evolved** from]{.mark} a relatively
[nascent]{.mark}]{.underline} area of experimental research [[to]{.mark}
a]{.underline}n international **[[strategic
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Global government funding in QT is
estimated as between \$34bn (McKinsey) and \$55bn (Quantum
Intelligence), with private investment gradually following suit in the
\$5-10bn range. This [[**investment** is]{.underline}]{.mark} truly
[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}, with public funding in excess of \$1bn in
China, the EU, US, Japan, UK, Canada, and India. However, [[the
strategies]{.mark} [underpinning]{.mark} these [investments vary]{.mark}
greatly]{.underline}. Whilst the US and China lead in total investment,
[[**China**'s focus is on]{.mark} large **[government-funded]{.mark}**
centres of [excellence]{.mark} with limited private equity]{.underline}.
In contrast, the US (and western powers more broadly) pursues greater
parity between private and public investment and has won a dominant
position in QT start-ups, with over a third of quantum companies based
in North America.

The rationale for [[investment has]{.underline}]{.mark} been both the
[[potential for]{.mark} substantial **[economic prizes]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} those who realise [**disruptive technologies**, [and
the]{.mark} clear [link between]{.mark} the promises of [**QT**
and]{.mark} the needs of [**defence** and]{.mark}
**[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The most often cited example is the
impact of Quantum Computing on cyber security, rendering certain forms
of classically secure cryptography vulnerable, necessitating a change of
cryptographic standards, and creating a credible opportunity for powers
to collect and store encrypted data today with the expectation of
decrypting in the future. This is a tangible threat in domains where
sensitive information may have a data lifespan of decades and elevates
quantum to a strategic priority.

However, quantum computing is not the only area of QT with strong
relevance to defence. [[**Quantum sensing** has]{.mark} the [potential
to provide **disruptive** capabilities in **land**, **sea**, **air** and
**space**]{.mark} -- offering both step-changes]{.underline} in current
sensing modalities [[and **new modes** of sensing
that]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[enhance **battlefield awareness**.
These]{.mark} [technologies]{.mark} [are]{.mark} not distant concepts;
**[real systems]{.mark}** are [reaching
demonstration]{.mark}]{.underline} in representative environments (TRL
6-7) and progressing towards platform integration for use. [Supporting
**[supply chains]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} also
**[maturing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however [[there **remain large
gaps** in]{.mark} areas such as **[standards]{.mark}**, [**assurance**,
and **certification**]{.mark}]{.underline}.  

[Understanding of Quantum Systems Engineering
([QSE]{.mark})]{.underline} [[is a]{.underline}]{.mark}n especially
[[**notable gap**. Systems engineering]{.mark} [and]{.mark} associated
[processes are]{.mark} deeply [embedded in **defence engineering**,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} it is quite clear that [Quantum
Systems]{.underline} Engineering [will [require **new
concepts**]{.mark}. These fall across the system life cycle
processes]{.underline} (as defined in ISO 15288), for example including
additions to reliability engineering due to quantum-unique failure modes
and effects, new notions of interfaces and system-of-interest boundaries
due to quantum entanglement, significant limitations in current
approaches to modelling and simulation (necessary for Model-Based
Systems Engineering), and, for some systems, changes in approach to
test, verification and validation (particularly towards statistical
black-box methods). The leap from demonstration to scalable, widely
deployable products will require progress across all of these gaps.

With these caveats of maturity in mind, let us consider a few specific
areas of quantum sensing in more detail.

[Quantum Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT)]{.underline}

[[**Resilience in PNT** is]{.mark} an]{.underline} established
[[**strategic imperative**. Over-reliance on]{.underline}]{.mark} Global
Navigation Satellite System [([GNSS]{.mark})]{.underline} [derived
signals for position and timing has become [an **acute problem**,
resulting in **significant**]{.mark} **[vulnerabilities]{.mark}**
to]{.underline} wide-area [[**denial** and]{.underline}]{.mark} to more
subtle [attacks like **[spoofing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the worst
cases [[this risks]{.mark} platforms operating with hazardously
**[misleading info]{.mark}rmation**]{.underline}, but even in less
severe cases can result in a loss of accurate knowledge of position,
[and]{.underline} more crucially [loss of accurate synchronised
time]{.underline}. A **[[loss of time]{.underline}]{.mark}** inevitably
[**[results in]{.mark}** a [**loss of communications**, and]{.mark} as
[reliance]{.mark} [on remote assets]{.mark} grows so does reliance on
guaranteed resilient connectivity. **[Quantum sensing]{.mark}**
solutions are seeking to [**address** all aspects of this
**problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Quantum Timing

Firstly, Quantum Clocks present one of the most mature areas of QT, and
many of the aforementioned gaps have been addressed for clocks
specifically. Quantum optical clocks that improve upon current widely
used rack-mounted clocks by 2-4 orders of magnitude in performance --
notably extending timing holdover in case of denial -- are now reaching
market. More interesting is that these architectures show promise for
significant miniaturisation without major degradation in performance.
Whilst unlikely to reach a chip-scale formfactor, board-scale products
could be realised within the next 5 years providing resilient timing
options to a much wider range of platforms such as small autonomous
systems and dismounted applications.

Quantum Navigation

Timing aside, positioning and navigation are also being advanced by
quantum technologies. In the absence of an external positioning signal
(whether GNSS or terrestrial, e.g. eLoran) navigation is performed by
dead reckoning from a known initial location. An Inertial Navigation
System (INS), consisting of accelerometers and a gyroscope, continuously
measures platform motion and uses this to determine changes to position
and heading over time -- enabling navigation from a known location
without additional external references. Dead reckoning is very
susceptible to errors in measurement, so sensor drift, accuracy and
measurement rate all limit the hold-over time inertial systems offer.  

Quantum accelerometers go some way to addressing these issues. They
provide highly accurate measurements that exceed classical systems, but
more importantly they very substantially reduce issues of drift since
measurements are made on physically identical atoms. Conversely, they
suffer major limitations in measurement rates (1-10Hz), which is
significantly less than the hundreds of Hertz required for dead
reckoning. Because of this, current quantum inertial sensors cannot be
used for navigation by themselves. However, they can provide powerful
drift-correction for classical systems, reducing their primary source of
error and extending hold-over. Quantum-Classical INS are currently
reaching demonstration and trial, TRL 6-7. Key integration and sensor
fusion work is required to bring them to maturity, but productisation is
expected within the next 5 years. First generation devices will have
high SWAP-C and likely be suited to large critical platforms such as
those in surface and sub-surface maritime domains, and there is a strong
impetus to then bring these to aircraft (a goal stated, for example, in
the UK quantum missions which explicitly seeks to achieve this by 2030).
 

Quantum Gravity Gradiometry

Quantum also introduces new mechanisms for position fixing across
platforms. The most notable approach here is quantum gravity sensing and
gravity gradiometry. Using a technology very similar to the
aforementioned quantum accelerometers, it is possible to make
ultra-accurate measurements of the earth's gravitational field strength
and field gradient. Furthermore, the unique properties of quantum
entanglement can be used to make these measurements highly resilient to
vibrations and noise, and hence accurate even if made from an
operational platform.

The earth's gravitational field is far from constant, and detailed maps
can be drawn of field strength or gradient (coarse global gravity maps
can be made from space, but fine-grained maps are often derived from
sensors flown over a region, or carried by hydrographic vessels). If
such a map is available, quantum gravity sensing can be used as a
completely passive means of localising one's position through map
matching. Quantum gravity gradiometers are high SWAP-C devices with
strong similarities to quantum accelerometers, but pose fewer
integration challenges since they do not need to be part of a
quantum-classical hybrid system. Currently solutions for land, sea and
air domains are being matured, with strong dual-use motivation driven by
use-cases in civil engineering (site surveying) and oil, gas and mineral
prospecting. This reveals a second key use-case for quantum gravity
sensors -- remote void and object detection. A measurement of the
gravity gradient is, essentially, a measurement of how mass underneath
the sensor is changing over a region. Therefore, measurements of gravity
features and anomalies may be used to detect and map underground
infrastructure, or to detect buried objects that are heavier than their
surroundings, providing new insights into the battlefield.

Quantum Magnetometry

Quantum sensors also enable very accurate magnetic field measurements.
The use of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) for
magnetic measurement is well established, and whilst being costly due to
the need for cryogenic operation, they are effective magnetic anomaly
detectors. In the same manner as gravity sensors this may be used for
magnetic map matching if there are magnetic landmarks to position
against. However, a more interesting use-case may be for anti-submarine
warfare, with SQUID systems on patrol aircrafts looking to detect
magnetic anomalies over open ocean.

Quantum RF Sensing

Moving away from the PNT context, QT is also making strides into
ultra-wideband RF sensing. Rydberg atom-based RF sensors provide a new
mechanism of receiving RF signals, with the promise of detecting very
low intensity modulated signals over a very large spectral range (from
Hz to THz), enabling wide swathe monitoring of the RF spectrum. There is
prominent defence-led investment in these systems, which are currently
at prototype stage. Notably comparative analysis of early prototype
systems against established RF sensors already shows competitive
sensitivity. Whilst less mature than some of the previously mentioned
technologies, Rydberg sensors have the potential to significantly
enhanced RF sensing capabilities both for monitoring purposes and
potentially for communications with lower signal strength requirements.

[[Chinese **Quantum Computing**]{.mark} Program [Is a **National
Security Threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[China [aims to be a **global leader** in technology innovation
and]{.mark}, as a nation, it [is the **closest** to the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates in competition]{.underline} for
the best software. Xi Jinping aspires to surpass the United States in
developing quantum sciences and all technological innovations, including
AI, cyberspace, and warfare. In 2016, [[China launched a **megaproject**
for **quantum communications**]{.mark} and computing, [which]{.mark}
aims to [achieve **significant breakthroughs** by
2030]{.mark}]{.underline}. This includes expanding China's national
quantum communications infrastructure, computing systems, and practical
quantum simulators. Since then, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has
pledged in its 14th five-year plan from 2021 to 2025 to fund an
estimated \$15.3 billion in quantum R&D.65 This amount accounts for
public disclosures and does not include classified programs.

Most recently, [**[physicists]{.mark}** in China [claim to]{.mark} have
[construct]{.mark}ed **[two quantum computers]{.mark}** with performance
speeds faster than Google's 54-qubit Sycamore processor]{.underline}:
the Jiuzhang 2.0 and the Zuchongzhi 2.0.66 The Jiuzhang 2.0 is a
113-qubit machine that can calculate in one millisecond a task that
would otherwise take the world's fastest conventional computer 30
trillion years to process. Zuchongzhi 2.0, a 66-qubit computer, can run
a calculation task one million times more complex than Google's Sycamore
quantum machine. While these developments do not surpass IBM's 433-
qubit Condor processor, China is working to outpace its competitors.

In late 2023, [a group of [Chinese researchers]{.mark} associated with
leading Chinese laboratories and institutions claimed to [have found a
**mechanism** to combine]{.mark} classical and [**quantum computing** to
break modern]{.mark} public-key Rivest--Shamir--Adleman **[(RSA)
encryption]{.mark}**]{.underline} using a 372-qubit computer.67 Their
paper,68 which has not been peer-reviewed, has caused a cascade of
concern from those who believed that a much larger qubit capability
would be needed to break modern-day encryption, and unleashed skepticism
among many other experts of its underlying merits. Still, the likelihood
of a quantum computation and technology breakthrough, either via
increased capabilities in qubits, modality stability, or along with
traditional advanced computation, is on the horizon. Additionally, a
[quantum actor like **[China]{.mark}**, which [seeks]{.mark} to achieve
and understand how [to **harness** these capabilities, will]{.mark}
likely [not **advertise** it]{.mark} for as long as possible [to seek to
**decrypt** as much data as **feasible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[China's]{.mark} work in quantum sciences [is a
**geopolitical**]{.mark} threat [and]{.mark} a [major **national
security** threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. China plans on fielding AI
systems backed by quantum technology that could "improve the
already-extensive analytics and surveillance capabilities deployed in
the name of national security."69 China is reportedly developing quantum
military applications, including stealth aircraft and communications
systems.70 Although China has claimed advancements in this area, experts
believe that it is "not likely to be an imminent threat to stealth
technology."71

Damage to Existing Arctic Undersea Cables

According to Finnish, Swedish, and Estonian government investigations,
[[a **Chinese** cargo ship]{.underline}]{.mark} that was registered in
Hong Kong (but possibly leased to a Russian-registered company) as the
Newnew Polar Bear [[appears to]{.mark} have [be]{.mark}en
[**responsible** for damaging two **subsea telecommunications
cables**]{.mark}]{.underline}---one connecting Finland and Estonia, and
the other connecting Estonia and Sweden---and damaging the 77-kilometer
Balticconnector natural gas pipeline in October 2023.167 Finnish
government investigations found that [[the ship's **anchor** was the
**primary** cause of]{.mark} the **[damage]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the
gas pipeline.168 The next step of the Finnish, Swedish, and Estonian
investigations was to determine whether the damage to the subsea cables
and gas pipeline was deliberate or accidental.169 According to Hanno
Pevkur, the Estonian defense minister at the time of the October 2023
incident, the fact that "[the anchor hung loose [for more than **100
nautical miles**]{.mark} (185 kilometers) between the damaged cables and
pipeline]{.underline}" makes it "difficult to accept that it was just an
accident."170

Although determining the intentionality behind the incident is difficult
to ascertain with precision, it is worth noting that international
legislation regarding who is responsible for repairing damaged undersea
cables, especially in time of war, is unclear.171 Currently, the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides a set of rules related
to the protection of undersea cables. The United States is not a
signatory to the convention.172 These rules were developed in 1982 and
specifically cover copper cables connecting two countries. Today, subsea
cables are primarily fiber optic, have multinational stakeholders, and
facilitate the simultaneous traffic of both civilian and military data
and information.173 This legal complexity might provide an incentive for
various actors to engage in sabotaging subsea cables. [[Chinese

the other it will still depend on a complex sociotechnical

scale quantum networks will undoubtedly complicate intelligence analysis
and require new kinds of technical expertise at signals intelligence
agencies, but [[it is **unlikely**]{.mark} that [they will **lock out**

if quantum computers marginally improve public trust in information
networks and thus the data on them, those networks will simply become
more attractive intelligence targets. New levels of trust will create
new opportunities for abusing trust. [The **golden age** of [cyber

1\. Introduction

The advancement of quantum sensing systems is likely to impact military
assets, delivering strategic and tactical advantages in position,
navigation, and timing (PNT). Moreover, [**[quantum sensing]{.mark}'s**
potential to revolutionize various domains **[aligns]{.mark}**
seamlessly [with]{.mark} U.S. [**national security** strategy with
respect to]{.mark} gathering **[crucial information]{.mark}**, assessing
threats, and delivering decision advantage]{.underline} \[1\]. Quantum
sensors, leveraging the delicate and precise nature of quantum states,
will likely [enable military and commercial enterprises to develop tools
that enhance sensing capabilities far [beyond the **limits** of
traditional]{.mark} **PNT [sensors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To meet emerging national security goals, the scope of this research was
guided by four factors: military application, quantum technology type,
quantum sensor viability, and quantum sensor design. While this research
focuses on the military application of quantum sensors, the results can
also be applied to other organizations, such as the Intelligence
Community, due to shared mission sets. Additionally, discussion of
advancements and needs in the private sector is necessary to provide
context for military applications because of the symbiotic relationship
between government and private-sector research \[2\]. The research
effort discussed in this article is founded on the assumption that
quantum sensors will outperform classical sensors with respect to
improvements in size, weight, and power---cost (SWaP-C) criteria.

The advent of quantum sensing necessitates that the U.S. military create
and adopt a coherent collection management strategy to maintain
awareness of related technologies being developed worldwide. Most
quantum sensors are being developed with two primary goals. The first is
to match the performance of traditional sensors but with lower SWaP or
greater reliability \[3\]. The second is to develop quantum sensors with
sensitivity and resolution that exceed what are possible with
conventional or current technology, potentially at the cost of SWaP-C
\[3\]. Various countries, including the United States, have made rapid
advancements in quantum clocks, gravimeters, gyroscopes, and
magnetometers that address at least one of these goals \[4\]. Despite
these advancements, [[there]{.mark} seem[s]{.mark} to be [a **lack**
of]{.mark} concerted [efforts for targeted **quantum sensor**
development]{.mark} across the U.S. government compared to other quantum
research areas, such as quantum computing]{.underline} \[4\]. [As a
result, [the]{.mark} U.S. [military]{.mark}]{.underline}, through the
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering,
[[has outlined **four** areas]{.mark} of quantum sensing
systems]{.underline} research currently being conducted by various
government entities: [**[electromagnetic]{.mark}** sensors, [**clocks**,
**accelerometers**]{.mark} and [**gyroscopes**, and
**gravimeters**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[5\]. These four areas will also
set parameters for the scope of this research

[Current quantum sensing [research efforts have **various**]{.mark}
military [applications]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quantum electromagnetic
sensors aim to impact radio frequency (RF) detection through Rydberg
atoms and their delocalized position from the nucleus, making them
sensitive to electric fields. [These sensors will likely [provide a
**better alternative** to]{.mark} the sensitive, wideband, **[portable
RF sensors]{.mark}** currently available through traditional sensing
methods]{.underline} \[5\]. Atomic clocks have tactical applications in
unmanned assets and classical PNT equipment \[5\]. Picosecond atomic
clocks can be integrated into strategic assets, such as large, stable
ground or naval platforms, for timing in global navigation satellite
system--denied environments, while sub-nanosecond, atomic vapor cell
optical clocks can be used for surface and subsurface timing in
operational scenarios \[5\]. Quantum accelerometers can provide
strategic level inertial navigation for space, naval, and air assets,
contributing to mission sets in Global Positioning System (GPS)--denied
territories \[5\]. [Paired with quantum accelerometers, quantum
gyroscopes are poised to [**replace** fiber-optic]{.mark} gyroscopes
[through **thermal atomic**]{.mark} beam sensors, [which provide
**deep-space** and **underwater**]{.mark} inertial [measurement]{.mark}
at a strategic level [in **GPS denied** locations]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[5\]. Lastly, quantum gravimeters are being developed for alternative
navigation, sensing, and guidance on subsurface and underground
platforms due to their ability to use gravity fields to map specific
regions \[5\]. With the Earth's gravitational map largely standardized,
with the exception of minor natural interferences, alternative means of
mapping and guidance can be achieved for missile assets and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capbabilities \[6\].

### Quantum\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Hazards\-\--2AC

#### New standards [minimize dangers]{.underline}.

Chad **Boutin 24**, science writer at National Institute of Standards
and Technology, \"NIST Releases First 3 Finalized Post-Quantum
Encryption Standards\",
https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards,
8-12-2024//ILake-AW

GAITHERSBURG, Md. --- [The U.S. Department of Commerce's National
Institute of Standards and Technology]{.underline}
(**[NIST]{.underline}**) has [finalized its]{.underline} principal [set
of **encryption algorithms**]{.underline} designed [to **withstand
cyberattacks**]{.underline} from a quantum computer.

Researchers around the world are racing to build quantum computers that
would operate in radically different ways from ordinary computers and
could break the current encryption that provides security and privacy
for just about everything we do online. The algorithms announced today
are specified in the first completed standards from NIST's post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) standardization project, and are ready for immediate
use.

The three new standards are built for the future. [Quantum computing
technology is developing]{.underline} rapidly, and some [experts
predict]{.underline} that [a device with]{.underline} the [capability to
**break current encryption**]{.underline} [methods]{.underline} could
appear within a decade, [threatening]{.underline} the
[security]{.underline} and privacy [of]{.underline} individuals,
organizations and entire **[nations]{.underline}**.

"The advancement of quantum computing plays an essential role in
reaffirming America's status as a global technological powerhouse and
driving the future of our economic security," said Deputy Secretary of
Commerce Don Graves. "Commerce bureaus are doing their part to ensure
U.S. competitiveness in quantum, including the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, which is at the forefront of this
whole-of-government effort. [NIST is]{.underline}
[providing]{.underline} invaluable [expertise to develop **innovative
solutions** to]{.underline} our [quantum challenges]{.underline},
[including security]{.underline} [measures like]{.underline}
**[post-quantum cryptography]{.underline}** [that
organizations]{.underline} can [start]{.underline} to [implement to
secure our post-quantum future]{.underline}. As this decade-long
endeavor continues, we look forward to continuing Commerce's legacy of
leadership in this vital space."

The standards --- containing the encryption algorithms' computer code,
instructions for how to implement them, and their intended uses --- are
the result of an eight-year effort managed by NIST, which has a long
history of developing encryption. [The agency]{.underline} has [rallied
the world's cryptography]{.underline} [experts to conceive, submit and
then evaluate cryptographic algorithms]{.underline} [that could
**resist**]{.underline} the [assault of quantum computers]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} [nascent technology]{.underline} [could
**revolutionize fields**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [weather
forecasting]{.underline} [to]{.underline} fundamental physics [to **drug
design**]{.underline}, but it carries threats as well.

"[Quantum computing]{.underline} technology [could become a force for
solving]{.underline} many of [society's **most intractable
problems**]{.underline}, and the [new standards]{.underline}
[represent]{.underline} NIST's [commitment to ensuring]{.underline} [it
will not]{.underline} simultaneously [**disrupt our
security**,"]{.underline} said Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards
and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E. Locascio. "These finalized
standards are the capstone of NIST's efforts to safeguard our
confidential electronic information."

Encryption carries a heavy load in modern digitized society. It protects
countless electronic secrets, such as the contents of email messages,
medical records and photo libraries, as well as information vital to
national security. Encrypted data can be sent across public computer
networks because it is unreadable to all but its sender and intended
recipient.

Encryption tools rely on complex math problems that conventional
computers find difficult or impossible to solve. A sufficiently capable
quantum computer, though, would be able to sift through a vast number of
potential solutions to these problems very quickly, thereby defeating
current encryption. The algorithms NIST has standardized are based on
different math problems that would stymie both conventional and quantum
computers.

"These [finalized standards include]{.underline} [instructions for
incorporating]{.underline} them [into products and encryption
systems]{.underline}," said NIST mathematician Dustin Moody, who heads
the PQC standardization project. "We encourage system administrators to
start integrating them into their systems immediately, because full
integration will take time."

Moody said that these standards are the primary tools for general
encryption and protecting digital signatures.

NIST also continues to evaluate two other sets of algorithms that could
one day serve as backup standards.

One of these sets consists of three algorithms designed for general
encryption but based on a different type of math problem than the
general-purpose algorithm in the finalized standards. NIST plans to
announce its selection of one or two of these algorithms by the end of
2024.

The second set includes a larger group of algorithms designed for
digital signatures. In order to accommodate any ideas that
cryptographers may have had since the initial 2016 call for submissions,
NIST asked the public for additional algorithms in 2022 and has begun a
process of evaluating them. In the near future, NIST expects to announce
about 15 algorithms from this group that will proceed to the next round
of testing, evaluation and analysis.

While analysis of these two additional sets of algorithms will continue,
Moody said that any subsequent PQC standards will function as backups to
the three that NIST announced today.

"[There is no need to **wait** for future standards]{.underline}," he
said. "[Go ahead and start]{.underline} [using **these
three**]{.underline}. [We need to be]{.underline} [**prepared** in case
of]{.underline} an [attack]{.underline} that defeats the algorithms in
these three standards, [and]{.underline} [we will continue working on
**backup plans**]{.underline} to keep our data safe. But for most
applications, [these **new standards** are the **main
event**]{.underline}."

#### Regulations are [already robust]{.underline} and will grow with the field.

Meredith **Fore 25**, Chicago-based science writer and physicist, \"The
legal frontier of quantum technology\", University of Chicago News,
https://news.uchicago.edu/story/legal-frontier-quantum-technology,
5-19-2025//ILake-AW

Quantum technologies are poised to transform society.

[In the coming]{.underline} [years]{.underline}, [quantum
developments]{.underline} [could]{.underline} produce sensors capable of
detecting disease at the very earliest stages; networks that offer
provably secure financial and medical record transfers; and eventually
computers that could, in just minutes, [perform analyses]{.underline}
[that would take today's]{.underline} [supercomputers **millions of
years.**]{.underline}

But the [**legal** and **regulatory systems**]{.underline} [surrounding
these innovations]{.underline} [are]{.underline} still [**taking
shape**,]{.underline} raising questions about whether existing laws can
address [concerns around intellectual]{.underline}
[property]{.underline}, antitrust, [liability, privacy and
more]{.underline}. At the same time, policymakers must weigh how to
protect U.S. interests without stifling the international collaboration
that's vital to the field's progress. Researchers who rely on foreign
equipment, international talent and cross-border collaborations already
face obstacles that some worry could impede progress.

These were among the issues [discussed]{.underline} [at]{.underline} a
panel organized by [the]{.underline} **[Chicago Quantum
Exchange]{.underline}** (CQE) last month at the University of Chicago
Law School.

The event, which focused most heavily on how the law should balance
global collaboration and the protection of U.S. interests, brought three
leading UChicago faculty together: David Awschalom, the Liew Family
Professor of Molecular Engineering and Physics at UChicago's Pritzker
School of Molecular Engineering, senior scientist at Argonne National
Laboratory, and director of the CQE; Aziz Huq, the Frank and Bernice J.
Greenberg Professor of Law; and Lior Strahilevitz, the Sidley Austin
Professor of Law.

The discussion was moderated by Robert W. Karr Jr., a partner at Barnes
& Thornburg LLP who co-chairs the firm's Quantum Technology Industry
Group.

[The panel marked the start]{.underline} [of a **broader effort**
to]{.underline} [explore]{.underline} [how]{.underline} legal and
[regulatory frameworks can **support** U.S. **quantum
research**]{.underline}, [commercialization and workforce
development]{.underline}. The work will include contributions by
industry experts, legal scholars, scientists and others.

"Quantum technology is in a critical place right now as applications
approach commercial viability," Awschalom said after the event. "The
field's enormous technological and economic potential is within view,
and the science is advancing more rapidly than expected. [Now is the
time]{.underline} [for conversations]{.underline} [about how
we]{.underline} can [**balance protection** and
**collaboration**]{.underline} in a way that encourages, not stifles,
innovation."

[Existing U.S. regulations aimed]{.underline} [at quantum
technologies]{.underline} often [focus on interactions]{.underline}
[with the **rest of world**]{.underline}---how we share and review
ideas, educate and hire talent, fund joint projects and exchange goods.
[The U.S. has entered into **bilateral agreements** with]{.underline}
nearly [**a dozen** countries]{.underline} [and]{.underline} has
[coordinated export controls]{.underline} with those and others.

But even [the 2018 **N**ational **Q**uantum **I**nitiative
**A**ct]{.underline}, which focused on accelerating quantum research and
development and is up for reauthorization, only [laid the groundwork for
a **comprehensive regulatory regime**]{.underline}.

Some [regulations have been implemented]{.underline}, [including
**export controls**]{.underline} on quantum technologies [and
**encryption standards**]{.underline} aimed at [protecting government
agencies]{.underline} and contractors from future quantum-enabled
attacks. But such restrictions can also slow progress, limiting how
researchers hire, collaborate and even equip their labs.

Quantum Sensing

[[**Quantum sensing** allows]{.underline}]{.mark} for extremely
[[precise measurements]{.mark}. The technology can [capture]{.mark}
high-resolution and highly **[sensitive
measurements]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the level [[of **individual
atoms**, providing]{.underline}]{.mark} greatly [[improved
**accuracy**]{.mark}. Quantum [sensing]{.mark}]{.underline} technologies
[[have a]{.mark} broad [**range of applications**, including
**healthcare** and **medical**]{.mark} [**research**, **environmental
monitoring**, **construction**, **energy**, **navigation**, and
**defense**. They are resistant]{.mark} [to]{.mark} electromagnetic
[**interference** and]{.mark} **jamming**]{.underline}. Their more
sensitive and precise [measurements [provide **greater
reliability**]{.mark} than conventional sensors]{.underline}.

[Quantum [sensing offers]{.mark}]{.underline} the possibility of [more
[**precise** and **secure** navigation. Critical]{.mark} civilian,
commercial, and [military systems]{.mark} rely on GPS]{.underline} and
the Precision Navigation and Timing (PNT) data it provides. [[**GPS** is
often the only]{.mark} [source of]{.mark}]{.underline} PNT [[data
for]{.underline}]{.mark} many [**[critical infrastructure]{.mark}**
systems (including finance and electrical power), [making]{.mark}
[them]{.mark} potential [targets]{.mark}]{.underline} for GPS
interference. [Using [**quantum sensing** could **eliminate**]{.mark}
these **[vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Quantum [sensing also
allows for high-precision navigation]{.underline} without the use of
GPS. Unlike GPS, [quantum navigation]{.underline} would not depend on an
external signal, making it [**resistant to jamming**. Quantum
sensors]{.underline} can [measure the Earth's gravitational and magnetic
fields]{.underline} to [detect]{.underline} minute [changes in motion
and electromagnetic impulses]{.underline}. Sensitive gravitometers
(instruments that measure the Earth's gravitational field) and
magnetometers can measure anomalies and compare them to existing data
and allow precise navigation without the need for satellite
communications.

There are several hurdles to achieving reliable quantum navigation,
given the complexity and delicate calibration of the necessary sensors.
These include needing lower cost, smaller size and weight, and improved
power components. Miniaturization also poses challenges, as
miniaturizing sensor platforms tends to reduce their sensitivity,
raising a barrier to effective applications.

[[Quantum sensing]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[has implications for
**intelligence**]{.mark}, [**surveillance**, and
**reconnaissance**]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities. [[The]{.mark} U.S.
[Army]{.mark}]{.underline} Research Lab [[developed]{.mark} a technique
known as "**[ghost imaging]{.mark}**" that uses the quantum
properties]{.underline} of light to detect distant objects through the
use of weak illumination beams. [These [beams]{.mark} are capable of
penetrating atmospheric conditions and are weak enough to [avoid
detection]{.mark}]{.underline} by the imaged target in many cases,
[making it]{.underline} a potentially [useful]{.underline} tool
[[for **covert operations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Another technique
known as **[[quantum illumination]{.underline}]{.mark}** could
[[improve]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[stealth
detection]{.underline}]{.mark}** capabilities [of quantum
radar]{.underline}. This technique is thought to be able to obtain a
higher signal-to-noise ratio than non-quantum sensors, which is [ideal
for detecting]{.underline} low-reflectivity targets amid high-noise
backgrounds, such as [stealth bombers during flight. [**Chinese
researchers** are working on]{.mark} a quantum [radar]{.mark}
system]{.underline} that can detect stealth aircraft, but some experts
question how successful China has been. [[Quantum sensors]{.mark}
could]{.underline} also [[make it easier to **detect**]{.mark}
**[submarines]{.mark}** and China claims to have made
progress]{.underline} in developing powerful quantum sensors for
submarine detection.

[[**Biomedical research** provides]{.underline}]{.mark} further
unique [[opportunities for]{.mark} quantum [sensing. The ability to
measure]{.mark} the electromagnetic fields of]{.underline} the brain,
heart, or other [[organs to study]{.underline}]{.mark} the impact of
**[[medical treatments]{.underline}]{.mark}** [could [lead to]{.mark}
more effective **[drug development]{.mark}** and]{.underline} to
potential [cures for]{.underline} some [disease]{.underline}s. Quantum
sensors will allow researchers to obtain data from the electromagnetic
field of a patient's brain that could be compared to a healthy brain,
enabling them to better understand the impact of certain drugs.

[Quantum [sensing]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[has applications for
medical **diagnostic imagery**]{.mark}. One example is]{.underline} that
[traditional sensing devices are not effective on children]{.underline}
because they are often too big and require the subject to remain still
during the scan. However, [[breakthroughs in quantum sensing]{.mark}
could change that, with]{.underline} the [ability to [detect and]{.mark}
[diagnose]{.mark}]{.underline} without requiring the patient to remain
still. Some [[quantum **devices** are **already being deployed**]{.mark}
in hospitals]{.underline}.

discussed earlier. [[The risk is a widening techno-economic

[investment in [quantum]{.mark}]{.underline} technology [[is]{.mark}
seen as [an investment in]{.mark} future [economic power]{.mark} [and

Military and Defense Applications Beyond code-breaking, quantum
technologies have direct military applications. Quantum computing can
greatly aid in defense-related computations (such as complex simulations
and optimizations), while quantum communications promise ultra-secure
links (important for command and control). Meanwhile, quantum sensing
can improve detection capabilities -- for instance, quantum sensors
might detect submarines or stealth aircraft by sensing minute
gravitational or magnetic anomalies, potentially undermining traditional
stealth and second-strike capabilities. These advances could upset
military balances. It's no surprise that quantum tech is now considered
an arena of rivalry similar to the Cold War race over nuclear
capabilities. In short, quantum is viewed as a critical future military
enabler, so much so that it appears alongside AI and hypersonics in
defense strategy documents of major powers.

[Leadership in quantum]{.underline} computing [is]{.underline} also [a
matter of national prestige and technological sovereignty.
[Mastering]{.mark} the cutting-edge of [quantum]{.mark}]{.underline}
science [[can elevate]{.mark} a **nation's [global status]{.mark}** as
a]{.underline}n innovation [leader]{.underline}. [Countries fear falling
behind]{.underline} and becoming dependent [on]{.underline} others for
[such a pivotal technology. Achieving major quantum
milestones]{.underline} (like demonstrating a powerful quantum computer
or a quantum satellite) [is]{.underline} often [celebrated domestically
as a]{.underline} "Sputnik moment"-like [triumph]{.underline}.
Conversely, [lagging in quantum capabilities raises
concerns]{.underline} of strategic dependency, where a nation might have
to rely on foreign quantum infrastructure or imports (whether for
computing power or skilled talent). [This motivates many governments to
cultivate a]{.underline}n indigenous [quantum
ecosystem]{.underline}---[encompassing research]{.underline}, talent
development, [and supply chains]{.underline}---for self-reliance [in
this critical field]{.underline}.

Given these stakes, it's clear why governments are treating quantum
computing as a strategic priority. [[The race to lead]{.mark} in
quantum]{.underline} technologies [is not just about scientific bragging
rights; it [carries]{.mark} real [implications for]{.mark} **[economic
leadership]{.mark}**, military [strength]{.mark}, cybersecurity, [and
the ability to set the rules in]{.mark}]{.underline} the emerging
[[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} era. As we examine how different
jurisdictions are approaching this field, we will see common themes of
heavy investment, public-private collaboration, and [national
[strategies explicitly link]{.mark}ing [quantum tech to]{.mark} national

Quantum Sensors in Fiber-Optic Communication:

[[**Fiber-optic** communication]{.mark} networks [form the **backbone**
of global data transmission]{.mark}]{.underline}, connecting continents,
cities, and industries with high-speed internet, telecommunication, and
data services. However, as data volumes grow and cyber threats become
more sophisticated, the need for both enhanced performance and security
in these networks is critical. This is where [[**quantum sensors** play
a **transformative** role]{.mark}, significantly [improving]{.mark} the
[**data integrity**, **noise reduction**, and]{.mark} overall
**[security]{.mark}** of fiber-optic communication systems]{.underline}.
Quantum sensors in fiberoptic networks enhance the performance by
reducing noise a key factor that degrades signal quality over long
distances. Traditional fiber-optic communication is susceptible to
thermal noise, scattering, and signal attenuation, especially as the
data travels over long distances through the fiber. As photons traverse
the fiber, their quantum states can be disturbed, leading to signal
degradation and reduced data integrity. By incorporating quantum sensors
into the system, particularly in quantum-enhanced optical amplifiers and
repeaters, the noise can be significantly reduced, allowing for more
precise signal transmission with minimal loss \[28\].

[**[Quantum sensors]{.mark}** work by [exploit]{.mark}ing [phenomena
such as **quantum entanglement** and]{.mark} **quantum
[coherence]{.mark}** [to **detect** and **correct** disturbances at the
**photon level**]{.mark}. This enables greater fidelity in the
transmission of data, [meaning]{.mark} the **[information]{.mark}** sent
across the network [arrives with]{.mark} far **[fewer
errors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For instance, quantum-enhanced repeaters
use entangled photons to boost the signal across large distances without
introducing additional noise. These repeaters preserve the quantum
states of the transmitted data, maintaining high data integrity and
ensuring that communication remains accurate and reliable, even over
long-haul networks \[29\]. [Beyond performance, [quantum sensors offer
**significant improvements** in security]{.mark} for fiber-optic
communication networks. [With]{.mark} the advent of quantum computers
and [increasingly **sophisticated** cyber-attacks]{.mark}, traditional
**[encryption]{.mark}** methods [may]{.mark} soon [become
**vulnerable**]{.mark}. [Quantum sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}, when used
in conjunction with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)[, [provide a
**future-proof** solution]{.mark} to this issue]{.underline}. By
leveraging quantum mechanics, QKD allows for the secure exchange of
encryption keys over fiber-optic cables. Any attempt to intercept or
eavesdrop on these keys would disturb the quantum states of the photons,
immediately alerting the system to the breach \[25\].

#### The Arctic provides a [shortcut]{.underline} avoiding [oversubscribed]{.underline}, [perilous]{.underline} routes.

**Gooding '25** \[Matthew; February 28; senior editor at Data Center
Dynamics, former managing editor of Tech Monitor, former business editor
of Cambridge News; "Poles apart: Building the Arctic\'s first subsea
cable,"
https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/poles-apart-building-the-arctics-first-subsea-cable/\]

But despite the presence of 5G in one of the Earth's most remote
locations, [**[fiber]{.mark} connections** in the **region** are much
rarer. Subsea Internet cables]{.underline}, which play a vital role in
connecting the world, [are few and far between in the oceans of the
**Arctic Circle**]{.underline}, with climatic and geopolitical factors
limiting their development.

[The **prize** for anyone who can **successfully operate** a cable [in
the Arctic]{.mark} is significant,]{.underline} though, [with the region
potentially able to **[provide]{.mark} a [shortcut]{.mark}** [to
connect]{.mark} the [**US**, **Europe**, and **Asia**, **relieving
pressure** on]{.mark} other, [**oversubscribed**,
routes]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A new consortium is taking up the challenge with an ambitious plan to
lay a cable, Polar Connect, right through the North Pole itself. This is
easier said than done, though, with significant technological and
environmental barriers to overcome if the project is to become a
reality.

A brief history of cables in the Arctic

The Arctic Circle is characterized as the geographical area where the
sun does not rise all day on the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice,
the shortest day of the year. It takes in areas of countries including
the US, Canada, Russia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and even a small part
of Iceland. Greenland, the world's largest island and a territory of
Denmark, sits almost entirely within its borders.

[Despite covering]{.underline} an area of some [20 million sq
km]{.underline} (7.7 million sq mi), most of which is occupied by ocean,
[[the Arctic]{.mark} Circle [is an **almost entirely**]{.mark} **subsea
[cable-free]{.mark} zone**]{.underline}. Per Submarine Cable Map, [the
[only]{.mark} cables traversing]{.underline} the seas of [the far north
currently are **[Russia's]{.mark}** domestic **[Polar Express]{.mark}**
cable]{.underline}, the first section of which was completed in 2022,
[[and]{.mark} the **[Svalbard]{.mark}** cable system]{.underline}, a
1,400km (\~840 mile) link that connects the island of Svalbard, the
world's northernmost civilian settlement, with the Norwegian mainland.

Enterprising engineers have been trying to lay a larger network of
cables around the Arctic, utilizing the Northern Sea Route, since the
1990s, says Howard Kidorf, managing partner at Pioneer Consulting, a
firm that advises its clients on the planning and implementation of
undersea cables. "I remember a project called Polarnet, which was
originally supposed to start construction in 2002," Kidorf says. "It was
a vision to connect Europe, Asia, and the US."

Polarnet was a Russian-owned company, and seemed to be making progress
towards its goal of linking East and West when, in 2012, it signed a
contract with US cable vendor Tyco (now Subcom) to construct the Russian
Optical Trans-Arctic Submarine Cable System, or ROTACS. But work on the
project was put on hold when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, and it was
eventually canceled.

[[Attempts]{.mark} were made [to]{.mark}]{.underline} revive the ROTACS
route in 2015 via Arctic Connect, a project led by Finland which would
have seen a 13,800km (8,575 mi) cable laid
**[[connect]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [the Nordic nation and
Japan]{.underline} via the Northern Sea Route[. This would have been the
shortest]{.underline} cable [linking Europe with Asia]{.underline}, and
Finnish telco Cinia joined forces with Russian telecoms firm MegaFon to
deliver the project, which was due to be up and running in 2021/22.
However, sanctions imposed on Russia after it waged war on Ukraine, plus
spiraling costs, saw Arctic Connect sink without a trace.

The Russians instead pursued Polar Express, which conjures images of a
cosy Christmas tale, but is in fact a state-funded cable connecting
different parts of Russia via the Arctic Ocean. The first section,
linking Teriberka and Amderma, was launched in October 2022, with a
second section due to come online in 2025. For obvious reasons, Polar
Express is not connected to any global telecoms networks.

[Elsewhere]{.underline}, Alaskan fiber company [Quintillion proposed
a]{.underline} northern [cable from [London to Tokyo]{.mark} via the
US]{.underline} state, and even built part of the link, with a subsea
cable in the Arctic Sea running [[from Alaska]{.mark}'s
Nome]{.underline} to Prudhoe Bay. [But plans]{.underline} for a more
ambitious network [[collapsed]{.underline}]{.mark} in spectacular
fashion [when Quintillion CEO]{.underline} Elizabeth Pierce [was
sentenced to]{.underline} 60 months in [jail for defrauding
investors]{.underline} out of more than \$270 million. Pierce was
convicted in 2019 after being found guilty of fabricating future revenue
contracts to convince investors to back the scheme.

"[Quintillion]{.underline} has not connected the big markets, so you
might look on that project as a failure, but in many ways it serves as a
useful proof of concept," Kidorf says. "[It shows that **you can lay and
service cables** in Arctic waters, so it's a step in the **right
direction**]{.underline}."

While it may seem like all attempts to drop cables in the Arctic Ocean
are cursed, [**enthusiasm** about the region's
**[potential]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a future fiber route [[remains
high]{.mark}. There are two practical reasons]{.underline} for this,
Kidorf says. One is that [[the region]{.mark} itself [is **increasingly
busy**]{.mark} with **shipping traffic** [and]{.mark} **industrial
activity**]{.underline} as global warming causes the polar ice cap to
recede. [The other is that it [could open]{.mark} up a **[faster
way]{.mark}** to connect Europe with Asia and the US, [avoiding]{.mark}
the **[crowded]{.mark}** and [**problematic routes** through the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"When the northern passages started opening, more ships started to
traverse those routes," Kidorf says. "Beyond that, there was already a
need for connectivity because there oil and gas facilities on the
northern coast of Alaska, First Nations on Canada's coast and many
extractive and military facilities on Russia's.

"[There are]{.underline} also [security concerns to
consider]{.underline} - the US, Canada, and Russia have always had radar
posts in the north, and Russia also has its submarine fleet anchored
there."

As the Arctic ice thaws, [things are]{.underline} also [hotting
up]{.underline} further south [[in the **Red Sea**]{.mark}, through
which [90 percent of]{.mark} all Internet [traffic between Europe and
Asia flows]{.mark}. "All]{.underline} the [cables available]{.underline}
right now [between Europe and Asia are expensive]{.underline}," Kidorf
explains. "They wiggle through the Mediterranean and the Middle East,
and [one of the motivations for]{.underline} setting up [**[new
routes]{.mark}** is to [avoid the]{.mark} Egypt
**[bottleneck]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[Not only is the route]{.underline} through the Middle East
[**crowded**, but it comes with]{.underline} considerable
**[peril]{.underline}**. DCD has previously reported on the threat posed
by [[Houthi rebels]{.underline}]{.mark} in Yemen, who have [declared
they [will **sabotage cables**]{.mark} as part of the **ongoing
conflict**]{.underline} in the African nation. [Attacks on ships in the
region could]{.underline} also [cause indirect issues]{.underline} for
the 15 cables that run adjacent to Yemeni waters, [with a **stray
anchor** capable of causing [an **outage**]{.mark} that [can
**last**]{.mark} **for [weeks]{.mark}**]{.underline} at a time.

the [significance of fiber optic solutions in quantum
technologies]{.underline}.

Overview of Quantum Technologies

Quantum technologies are the [[futuristic gadgets]{.mark} of
science]{.underline}. It is a branch of physics that deals with how
really tiny things, like atoms and particles, behave. Imagine it as a
mix of physics, computer science, and engineering. This field uses the
rules of [**quantum [mechanics]{.mark}** to [create new tools]{.mark}
and applications]{.underline}. Now, quantum mechanics is just the part
of physics that [explains how things work on a **super tiny
scale**]{.underline}.

Linking Fiber Optic Cables and Quantum Technologies

The link between [**fiber optic [cables]{.mark}** [and
**quantum**]{.mark} **technologies** [is]{.mark} a **[symbiotic]{.mark}
relationship** that promises to advance various fields]{.underline}.
Fiber optic cables serve as the [**physical [infrastructure]{.mark}**
[for transmitting]{.mark} quantum [information]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**connecting quantum devices**, [and enabling the **practical
implementation**]{.mark} of quantum technologies.]{.underline} Let's see
how fiber optic cables and quantum technologies are interconnected.

Quantum Communication

Role of Fiber Optics: [Fiber optic **[cables provide]{.mark}** the
channels through which **quantum [information]{.mark}**]{.underline},
often carried by photons, is transmitted over long distances.

[**S**ecure **Q**uantum **K**ey **D**istribution
(**[QKD]{.mark}**]{.underline}): Quantum key distribution relies on
transmitting quantum keys to [**[secure
communication]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Fiber optic [[cables
ensure]{.mark} the [efficient and secure delivery]{.mark} of these
**quantum keys**]{.underline} between users[.]{.underline}

Quantum Computing

Interconnecting Quantum Processors: Quantum computers are often composed
of [**[multiple]{.mark} quantum** [processors]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Fiber [[**optic cables** serve]{.mark} as [interconnects]{.mark},
allowing quantum bits (qubits) [to communicate]{.mark} and
collaborate]{.underline} across different [**quantum computer
[components]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Quantum Networks

Creating Quantum Highways: Quantum networks, where multiple quantum
devices are interconnected, [rely on **fiber optic [cables]{.mark}** to
establish [the **necessary links**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These quantum
highways enable the [**seamless exchange** of quantum information
**[between]{.mark} different [nodes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[network]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Quantum Sensing

Extending Reach of Quantum Sensors: [**Quantum [sensors]{.mark}**[,
known for]{.mark} their **[precision]{.mark}**]{.underline}, often need
to [transmit signals [over]{.mark} **[significant
distances]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Fiber optic cables offer a reliable
means to extend the reach of quantum sensors, facilitating applications
such as [**environmental monitoring**]{.underline} and healthcare.

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

Quantum-Secure Communication Channels: [**Fiber optic cables** are
crucial in establishing **secure** quantum **communication
channels**]{.underline}. QKD protocols use the unique properties of
quantum states to ensure that any [**[eavesdropping]{.mark}
[attempt]{.mark}** would [be **detected**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Quantum Information Processing: A Paradigm Shift

Quantum computers leverage the principle of [**quantum
[mechanics]{.mark}** that [have]{.mark} the [potential to
perform]{.mark} complex [calculations at]{.mark} **[extraordinary
speeds]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Unlike classical computers that use bits
to represent information as either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum
bits or qubits.

Fiber optic cable companies provide a means of transmitting quantum
information between various components of a quantum computer. The
fragile nature of quantum states requires a medium that can preserve the
coherence of qubits. The [fiber optic cables, with their low loss and
high bandwidth capabilities, emerge as an **ideal medium** for this
**quantum information**]{.underline}.

Quantum Communication: Securing the Unbreakable Code

In communications, quantum technologies promise unbreakable encryption
through quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD relies on the principles of
quantum mechanics to secure communication channels. Fiber optic cables
act as the backbone of this revolutionary system.

In a QKD setup, quantum particles, typically photons, transmit
cryptographic keys between users. The transmission of these quantum keys
over long distances requires a reliable and efficient medium. Fiber
optic installation provides the necessary infrastructure. Fiber optics'
low attenuation and low signal distortion ensure that quantum keys can
be transmitted over hundreds of kilometers without compromising their
quantum states.

Quantum Sensing

Apart from computing and communication[, [quantum]{.mark} technology
also [**advances** the **sensing field**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quantum
sensors are based on the phenomena of [**[entanglement]{.mark} and
[superposition]{.mark}** that [exhibit]{.mark} **[unprecedented
precision]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Fiber optic cables can transmit
signals over long distances without significant losses and enhance the
application of quantum sensing technologies.

For example, [quantum [**sensors** can be
integrated]{.mark}]{.underline} into fiber optic networks [[to
create]{.mark} **susceptible [detectors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They can
be further [used to [measure **environmental changes** and]{.mark}
**detect [gravitational]{.mark}** [waves]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Solvency\-\--Redundancy\-\--Ext

#### Cable development increases [redundancy]{.underline}, which [avoids cascading failure]{.underline}.

Strategy,

2-27-2025//ILake-AW

Finally, [the United States]{.underline} [should]{.underline} leverage
private capital and its allies to [add **redundancy**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} shared [undersea infrastructure]{.underline}. [Just as
critical infrastructure]{.underline} and computer systems ashore [are
designed to **avoid single point failures**]{.underline}, [having **more
cables**]{.underline} [in service]{.underline} [will]{.underline}
inherently [boost network resiliency]{.underline}. [Sabotage of
a]{.underline} singular [cable can cut off communication]{.underline},
but if that cable [is one of **many crisscrossing**]{.underline} the
ocean depths, [information can be **routed around** a breach to
**maintain service**]{.underline}. These cable projects are expensive,
but [leading U.S. companies have shown a **willingness to invest** in
these projects]{.underline} [and]{.underline} may [be **viable
partners** for the U.S. government]{.underline}. The United States
should also invest more in allied initiatives like the Partnership for
Cable Connectivity and Resilience and the South Pacific Connect projects
announced in 2023.

[The United States **cannot eliminate**]{.underline} its [reliance on
**digital connectivity**]{.underline} [nor obviate]{.underline} the
[danger from]{.underline} the [bad actors]{.underline} who threaten
digital infrastructure. [The best thing U.S. policymakers]{.underline}
[can do to safeguard]{.underline} its [national security is build
**resiliency**]{.underline} against undersea sabotage
[through]{.underline} our unique advantage---
**[innovation]{.underline}**.

#### Redundancy is limited\-\--empirics prove

[[Redundancy provides resilience, **but with
limits**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Submarine cable networks are built with redundancy in mind, particularly
for major hubs. [But that redundancy **[doesn't always translate to
immunity from disruption]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[While multiple cables typically serve major regions, creating **natural
redundancy**, the impacts of **[outages can be more complex than
expected]{.mark}**. Madory shared a telling example: \"Take
[Nigeria]{.mark}---[had a domestic payment system]{.mark} [that]{.mark}

Probably [because]{.mark} it had some sort of [DNS dependency]{.mark}

Northwestern University [[engineers]{.underline}]{.mark} are the first
to [**successfully** [demonstrate]{.mark} **[quantum
teleportation]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} a **[fiber]{.mark} optic
[cable]{.mark}** already carrying Internet traffic.]{.underline}

The [[discovery]{.underline}]{.mark}, published in the journal Optica,
[[introduces]{.mark} the **new possibility** of combining
**[quantum]{.mark} communication** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} existing
Internet [[cables]{.underline}]{.mark} --- greatly
[**[simplifying]{.mark}** the [infrastructure]{.mark}
required]{.underline} for for [**[advanced]{.mark} [sensing
technologies]{.mark}** or quantum]{.underline} computing
**[applications]{.underline}**.

"This is incredibly [exciting because [nobody **thought** it was
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Northwestern's Prem Kumar, who led
the study. "Our [work shows]{.underline} a [[path]{.underline} [towards
**next-gen**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[eration
[quantum]{.mark}]{.underline}** and classical [networks
sharing]{.underline} a unified **[fiber optic
infrastructure]{.underline}**. Basically, it [[opens]{.mark} the [door
to]{.mark}]{.underline} pushing **[quantum
[communications]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the next level."

An expert in quantum communication, Kumar is a professor of electrical
and computer engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of
Engineering, where he directs the Center for Photonic Communication and
Computing.

How it works

Only limited by the speed of light, [quantum]{.underline} teleportation
[[enables]{.underline}]{.mark} a new[,
**[ultra-fast]{.mark}**]{.underline}, secure [[way to **share
information**]{.mark} between]{.underline} [distant]{.underline} network
[users]{.underline}, wherein direct transmission is not necessary. The
process works by [harnessing **quantum entanglement**]{.underline}, a
[technique in which two particles are linked]{.underline}, regardless of
the distance between them. [Instead]{.underline} [of particles
physically traveling]{.underline} to deliver information, [[entangled
particles **exchange inf**]{.mark}**ormation**]{.underline} over great
distances --- without physically carrying it.

"[In optical]{.underline} communications, all [signals]{.underline} are
[converted to light]{.underline}," Kumar explained. "While [conventional
signals]{.underline} for classical communications typically [comprise
millions of particles of light]{.underline}, [**quantum information**
uses single photons]{.underline}."

"By performing a destructive measurement on two photons --- one carrying
a quantum state and one entangled with another photon --- the quantum
state is transferred onto the remaining photon, which can be very far
away," said Jordan Thomas, a Ph.D. candidate in Kumar's laboratory and
the paper's first author. "The [photon itself does not have to be sent
over **long distances**]{.underline}, but its state still ends up
encoded onto the distant photon. **[[Teleportation
allows]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[exchange of
information]{.underline}]{.mark} over great distances
**[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}** [requiring]{.underline} the
**[information]{.underline}** itself [to [travel]{.mark}]{.underline}
that distance."

The key: Finding the right route to avoid traffic

Before Kumar's new study, many researchers were uncertain if quantum
teleportation was possible in cables carrying classical communications.
The entangled photons would drown among the millions of other light
particles. It would be like a flimsy bicycle trying to navigate through
a crowded tunnel of speeding heavy-duty trucks.

Kumar and his team, however, found a way to help the delicate photons
steer clear of the busy traffic. After conducting in-depth studies of
how light scatters within fiber optic cables, the researchers found a
less crowded wavelength of light to place their photons. Then, they
added special filters to reduce noise from regular Internet traffic.

"We carefully studied how light is scattered and placed our photons at a
judicial point where that scattering mechanism is minimized," Kumar
said. "We found we could perform **[quantum
[communication]{.mark}]{.underline}** without interference from the
classical channels that [are **[simultaneously
present]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

To test the new method, Kumar and his team set up a 30 kilometer-long
fiber optic cable with a photon at either end. Then, they simultaneously
sent quantum information and high-speed Internet traffic through it.
Finally, they measured the quality of the quantum information at the
receiving end while executing the teleportation protocol by making
quantum measurements at the mid-point. The researchers found the
[quantum information was **successfully transmitted**]{.underline} ---
[even with busy Internet traffic]{.underline} whizzing by.

"Although [many [groups]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[investigated]{.underline} the in [[**coexistence** of quantum]{.mark}
and classical communications]{.underline} fiber, this work [is the first
to show **quantum teleportation**]{.underline} in this new scenario,"
Thomas said. "This ability to send information without direct
transmission [**[opens]{.mark} the [door]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} even
[more]{.mark} [advanced]{.mark} quantum
[applications]{.mark}]{.underline} being performed without dedicated
fiber."

Future possibilities

Next, Kumar plans to extend the experiments over longer distances. He
also plans to use two pairs of entangled photons --- rather than one
pair --- to demonstrate entanglement swapping, another important
milestone leading to distributed quantum applications. Finally, his team
is exploring the possibility of carrying out experiments over real-world
inground optical cables rather than on spools in the lab. But, even with
more work to do, Kumar is **[optimistic]{.underline}**.

"[Quantum [teleportation]{.mark}]{.underline} has the [**ability** to
[provide]{.mark} quantum [connectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[securely]{.underline}** between **[geographically distant
nodes]{.underline}**," Kumar said. "But many people have long assumed
that nobody would build specialized infrastructure to send particles of
light. If we choose the wavelengths properly, [we [**won't have to
build** new infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Classical
communications and [[quantum]{.mark} communications [can
**coexist**]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

#### Absolute zero is [unnecessary]{.underline}.

Game-Changer For Quantum Computing,"
https://www.iflscience.com/breakthrough-qubit-control-near-absolute-zero-is-scalability-game-changer-for-quantum-computing-79766\]

The power of **[[qubits]{.underline}]{.mark}** (quantum bits) is that
they are not just 1s or 0s like the regular bits in your computer or
phone. They behave in a quantum mechanical way, [unlock]{.underline}ing
[incredible **processing power**]{.underline}, as long as you have lots
of them. [Qubits are]{.underline} also very [fragile, and]{.underline}
they [[need]{.mark} to be kept at]{.underline} very [low
temperatures]{.underline} for stability, [usually close to [absolute
zero]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One way to make qubits is spin qubits, where the information is encoded
in the magnetic direction of an electron. These could be made directly
on the semiconductors we are already using in the computer industry, but
the integrated circuitry you need to measure and control the qubits
would affect the qubits due to the heat and electricity. [Well, **[until
now]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Researchers]{.underline} have [demonstrated]{.underline} that [it is
possible to craft [a]{.mark} common complementary
**[metal-oxide-semiconductor]{.mark}** that [doesn't have those
problems. You can make]{.mark} a **[common transistor]{.mark}** ready to
be [a **quantum device**, and]{.mark} so **[scale-up]{.mark}** quantum
processors [to have **millions** of qubits]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the
range [where they]{.underline} become useful.

["This will take us from]{.underline} the realm of quantum computers
being [fascinating laboratory machines to]{.underline} the stage where
we can start [discovering the **real-world problems** that these devices
can **solve for humanity**]{.underline}," lead researcher Professor
David Reilly from the University of Sydney said in a statement.

[[The experiment]{.underline}]{.mark} involving one and two qubits was
led by Dr Sam Bartee, and Dr Kushal Das was the lead designer of the
control chip. They [[found **negligible fidelity loss**]{.mark} in the
single-qubit operation, **[no reduction of coherence time]{.mark}**
in]{.underline} both single and two[-qubit operations, [and **negligible
interference**]{.mark} **of electrical noise**]{.underline} from the
system.

"This result has been more than a decade in the making, building-up the
know-how to be able to design electronic systems that dissipate tiny
amounts of power and operate near absolute zero. [[We have]{.mark} now
demonstrated [a **scalable control platform** that can be **integrated**
with qubits **without destroying**]{.mark} the fragile [quantum
states]{.mark}]{.underline},\" said Reilly.

["[This validates]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[hope]{.mark}
that]{.underline} indeed [[qubits can be controlled at scale]{.mark} by
[integrating **complex electronics** at **cryogenic
temp**]{.mark}**erature[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our paper shows that
with careful design of the control system, fragile qubits hardly notice
the switching of transistors in a chip less than a millimetre away."

A major [scientific thrust]{.underline} [from recent years]{.underline}
[has been to]{.underline} try to [harness **quantum**]{.underline}
phenomena [to increase the]{.underline} [**performance** of]{.underline}
a wide variety of [information processing devices]{.underline}. Quantum
Information Science (QIS) has emerged as a scientific undertaking that
promises to revolutionize our information infrastructure.1, 2 In
particular, QIS [offers]{.underline} the [possibility of quantum
sensors]{.underline}.3--9 That is, sensing devices that exploit quantum
phenomena in such a way [that]{.underline} they [perform]{.underline}
[**much better** than]{.underline} their [classical
counterparts.]{.underline} Some examples of quantum sensing devices with
a clear military application include radar,10, 11 magnetometers,12 and
gravimeters.13

In this talk we will briefly describe recent theoretical research that
suggests that by harnessing quantum phenomena we can improve quantum
sensing. Indeed, the [possibility of realizing quantum]{.underline}
[**sensor** systems]{.underline} has [dramatically
increased]{.underline} [because]{.underline} of [recent]{.underline}
**[promising]{.underline}** [theoretical and experimental]{.underline}
[results]{.underline} [regarding manipulation]{.underline},
[entanglement, propagation, detection]{.underline}, [and
interferometry]{.underline} of quantum states. At the same time, many
theoretical and experimental questions remain open (e.g., fast and
efficient entanglement generation, single photon detectors, quantum
signal processing, and quantum memories). Furthermore, it is important
to notice that [quantum sensors]{.underline} [are **not
intended**]{.underline} [to **replace** traditional]{.underline}
[sensing]{.underline} systems, [but]{.underline} to **[work
together]{.underline}** in order [to leverage]{.underline} the [benefits
of both]{.underline}. Clearly, quantum sensing appears to be a
"high-risk / high-payoff" endeavor that deserves further scientific and
engineering consideration, research, and discussion.

Spending a small fortune to make Nome a fully equipped naval rest stop
is emblematic of a larger trend reshaping the High North. [[An
**unprecedented infrastructure boom**]{.mark}, made possible in part by
global warming, [is transforming the region into **an increasingly
militarized and industrial landscape**]{.mark}---one where the
[**extraction** of natural resources and degradation]{.mark} of the
environment are [accelerating]{.mark} in tandem.]{.underline}

This isn't the first time [[the federal government]{.mark} [has sought
to build]{.mark} a deepwater port [in remote
Alaska]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the 1950s, the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission surveyed the nation in search of creative ways to use nuclear
bombs in infrastructure projects. Proposals included bombing the earth
to make way for roads, railways, mines, and canals, as well as
detonating buried nuclear explosives to extract oil and gas from shale
formations---nuclear fracking. One project proposed using a handful of
nuclear bombs, each one more than six times more powerful than the bomb
dropped on Hiroshima, to excavate a harbor at a site 250 miles north of
Nome. More than half a century after that plan was scrapped[, the [U.S.
is finally getting its deepwater port in the High
North]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Similar stories echo across the Arctic these days. [[Chinese and
Australian mining firms are prospecting Greenland in search of rare
earth minerals]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Russia, President Vladimir Putin
has directed a massive Arctic investment program, trying to reduce the
Russian economy's dependence on Europe by pivoting toward Asia. For
years, Russia has been building up its fleet of nuclear-powered
icebreakers, with hopes of keeping the Northern Sea Route open
year-round to ship liquefied natural gas to Asian markets via the Arctic
Ocean. In Alaska[, the [Department of Defense]{.mark} just
[awarded]{.mark} a [**\$38 million grant** to]{.mark} a [graphite mine
near Nome,]{.mark}]{.underline} accessible only by helicopter and
worryingly close to the Iñupiaq village of Teller.

To a certain extent, history is repeating itself[. [The Arctic has
**been** a]{.mark} resource [**frontier** for
**centuries**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Before fossil fuels came into
widespread use in the late nineteenth century, whales were slaughtered
for their blubber---the primary fuel used in oil lamps across Europe and
North America. When large whales were wiped out in temperate waters,
whalers pushed into the Arctic and Southern Oceans. A few decades later,
the Arctic became the site of a series of gold rushes. In the twentieth
century, the discovery of oil and gas across the High North led to waves
of investment. During the Cold War, military installations were built
and later abandoned, including the decommissioned radar station that
overlooks the Port of Nome.

Far from being a pristine landscape, the Arctic is riddled with evidence
of this history. Rusted mining equipment, spilled toxins, and abandoned
locomotives are everywhere, if you know where to look. The Yukon River,
which flows 2,000 miles from Canada to Western Alaska, dumps up to five
tons of mercury into the North Pacific each year---the remnants of a
gold rush that ended over a century ago. On St. Lawrence Island, not far
from Nome, 180,000 gallons of diesel were spilled at a Cold War--era
military base in 1969, destroying a Siberian Yupik hunting and fishing
camp.

But [[this most **recent** **rush**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the Arctic
[is]{.underline} decidedly different from previous ones[, **[pushing
further North and seeking out different
resources]{.mark}.**]{.underline} I spoke with Rick Thomen, a
climatologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who enjoys a certain
celebrity status in the state. "In some significant sense," he told me,
"we can say that the construction boom is entirely climate change
driven."

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [[federal government will build northern
military]{.mark} operational [support hubs]{.mark} in Iqaluit,
Yellowknife, and Inuvik]{.underline}, Defence Minister Bill Blair
announced Thursday, [while promising [there will be
more]{.mark}]{.underline} to come [[as]{.mark} [Ottawa **ramps up**
]{.mark}**its [military footprint in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [[hubs are]{.mark} the [cornerstone of]{.mark} the [federal
government's Arctic security strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
committed [\$2.67 billion]{.underline} over 20 years to building them.

[Blair was in Iqaluit Thursday to announce the first three locations and
said [the department]{.mark} is [planning]{.mark} to build [**more
than**]{.mark} the [**five** operational]{.mark} [hubs]{.mark} discussed
in Canada's new defence policy last April.]{.underline}

"The discussions that we've been having in the subsequent 10 months
clearly indicates that there may be additional locations," Blair told
The Canadian Press. He didn't offer a precise number.

"It's been an ongoing discussion with Canadians, but also with our
allies, that Canada needs to do more to secure its sovereignty and
defend our country," Blair added. "And the Arctic is probably the most
important place to do it."

Operational support hubs are not military bases. The Department of
National Defence says they support military operations through
communications and transport infrastructure and by providing secure
storage for supplies.

The hubs will also be tasked with assisting search and rescue efforts in
the region. Currently, military aircraft taking part in
search-and-rescue missions in the Arctic often have to fly in from
hundreds of kilometres away --- particularly for searches in Nunavut.

While the Iqaluit, Yellowknife and Inuvik hubs will build on the
infrastructure already in place for Norad Forward Operating Locations in
those locations, it's not clear what kind of military functions the hubs
will carry out

Asked whether he sees fighter jets being stationed at the hubs in the
future, Blair said those operational discussions will happen in due
course.

"Ultimately, I think the Air Force has got to tell me, for example, what
to do with the fighter jets," Blair said.

He said while the government has invested \$230 million in extending the
airport runway in Inuvik, the facility's six hangars can't accommodate
the new F-35 fighter jets Canada is buying.

"There's challenges in that region on fuel depots. I don't want the
military to compete with the community for power generation and
heating," he said.

"I think there's a real opportunity for us to talk about the things that
we need to do from the military side that would be mutually beneficial
to the community and the people that live there."

The announcement is being welcomed by the territorial government and the
City of Iqaluit, since the military is promising improved infrastructure
in the city to operate the hub --- including better communications,
water and power facilities.

Baltic Sentry: A NATO Response 

[[In **response** to]{.mark} the [Russian sabotage of **CUI**]{.mark},
[NATO has implemented **Operation Baltic

by deploying ships, drones, and aircrafts to monitor the Baltic Sea. It
also uses artificial intelligence to monitor suspicious movements and

[Operation Baltic Sentry [sanctions **rogue vessels** by targeting

5.2 Potential consequences for strategic ASW

[Even if we assume advances in signal processing sufficient to allow
emerging [quantum]{.mark} magnetometers to be sensitivity limited rather
than limited by environmental noise, the [maximum detection
range]{.mark}s [would]{.mark} still [be]{.mark} relatively [**small**
compared to the size of the ocean]{.mark}.]{.underline} Assuming the
upper limit of sensitivities from Chapter 3 and the simplified
(upper-limit) detection distance estimate from above, detection ranges
of quantum magnetometers in the near-term future would be around 10 km
at maximum. As discussed in Section 2.1.1, there is a very large area of
ocean to search and monitor. Furthermore, if sensitivities increased
further, Eq. 5.2 indicates that the detection range scales with the
inverse of the cube root of Bmin.

To achieve the feat of 'fully transparent oceans' policymakers have
expressed concerns over in analyses like \[4\] would require consistent
monitoring of millions of square kilometers of oceans. Even assuming a
detection range of 10 km, a network of approximately 1 million floating
MADs would be needed \[13\]. A state would have severe difficulties
maintaining this network, especially in a manner where they do not
indicate to adversaries they are creating such a network. Interference,
either natural (for instance from weather events or interactions with
marine life) or unnatural (attempts of sabotage) would necessitate large
upkeep and replacement requirements.

[Another possibility that has been the source of some discussion is a
detection strategy of '[tracking']{.mark} \[4, 13\].]{.underline} This
would consist of using alternatively-sourced information about a
submarine's location for targeted surveillance over smaller regions.
However, such an approach would present its own operational
difficulties. For instance, nuclear-armed submarines travel at speeds of
up to 20 knots \[17\]. [As such, continued tracking [would require a
network of]{.mark} high-speed [**drone swarms** or a]{.mark} large
enough [fleet of]{.mark} dedicated nuclear-powered general-purpose
[submarines to follow all foreign submarines of
interest.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, an adversary using this
strategy would have more difficulty assuring themselves of a disarming
first strike. They would have to account for each and every submarine.
Additionally, if a tracking network loses a submarine, it would require
a new piece of information to begin tracking again.

[Thus, [even if]{.mark} advanced [quantum sensors provided a
**ten-fold** increase]{.mark} in detection range over currently deployed
MAD sensors, there [would still be]{.mark} major operational
[challenges]{.mark} that would have to be met [to accomplish]{.mark}
persistent [monitoring or tracking]{.mark}. Any increase in detection
range does technically increase the feasibility of deploying such
systems, but there would be obvious signs of such a process that could
signal an adversary to start developing countermeasures]{.underline}

[As such, the potential [consequences]{.mark} for strategic ASW seem to
[not]{.mark} be [as monumental as]{.mark} some reports have
[feared]{.mark}. This is due to a variety of factors, including the d −
1 3 scaling of magnetic anomaly with distance, potential countermeasures
available to reduce induced moment, [and]{.mark} the difficulty of
isolating submarine magnetic anomalies from those caused by other
sources.]{.underline} However, perhaps the clearest reason why quantum
magnetometry will not be a 'revolutionary' emerging technology is simply
that it already exists. [As such, advances in submarine detection as a
result of [quantum magnetometry will **build off of existing
MADs**]{.mark}, rather than occur in a completely novel
manner.]{.underline}

#### Adversaries can circumvent sub detection

Natasha **Bajema 24**, \[Bajema has a PhD from Tufts in International
Relations and National Security Studies and is a national security
expert with the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the

Even the Most Advanced Subs Have Nowhere to Hide?\", IEEE Spectrum,
https://spectrum.ieee.org/submarine-stealth // shaka

Meanwhile, significant advances in detection technologies have reduced
the effectiveness of submarine stealth. Today, increasingly
sophisticated and distributed sensor networks collect information across
multiple domains, much like the SOSUS hydrophone arrays that the U.S.
Navy deployed in the Atlantic and Pacific during the Cold War. [The
[rise of quantum sensors]{.mark}, which can detect delicate
perturbations in the environment at the atomic level, [promises]{.mark}
even **[greater sensitivity and accuracy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And the
AI-enabled systems that analyze sensor data can easily spot subtle
anomalies in the ocean, such as changes caused by a passing submarine,
which a human analyst would probably miss.

P.W. Singer, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and coauthor
of the technothriller Ghost Fleet---in which Russia and China team up
against the United States with a new capability to detect and track U.S.
nuclear submarines from their radiation emissions---suggests that AI's
"ability to make sense of disparate wisps of data from a variety of
sensors...will enable the detection of targets that could have remained
stealthy in the past."

Other experts, including Roger Bradbury and Scott Bainbridge, claim this
technological revolution has already produced unprecedented ocean
transparency. If the most extreme predictions come true, the stealth of
Australia's new fleet of nuclear submarines could be dead in the water
less than a decade into their operational lifetimes.

Advanced tactics to preserve submarine stealth

Many experts say they're unconcerned about these incursions on submarine
stealth. [[Naval operators]{.mark}, they claim, [still have **plenty of
ways to protect the stealth** of]{.mark} their
[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}. These stealth-preserving techniques
include 1) [countering detection through **noise**]{.mark}, 2)
[deploying **more underwater drones**, and]{.mark} 3) [using strategic

#### Quantum sensors [can't]{.underline} increase SSBN [vulnerability]{.underline} to the level of [threatening]{.underline} nuclear deterrence.

The past two years have seen various developments that point to an
uncertain nuclear future. These include China's nuclear modernisation,
Russia's sabre-rattling, and even South Korea's nuclear ambitions. This
is amidst [[**technological developments** that make nuclear arsenals
**less** secure]{.underline}]{.mark}, and future technologies that
[could [threaten]{.mark} **nuclear [deterrence]{.mark}** even
more]{.underline}. Since [nuclear-armed [submarines **serve** as the
**cornerstone** of]{.mark} nuclear **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
because of their survivability, it is important to consider emerging
technologies that pose a threat to them. Easy [[detection of]{.mark}
ballistic missile submarines (**[SSBNs]{.mark}**) has [caused
**destabilising behaviour**]{.mark} in the past]{.underline} and would
be particularly dangerous in situations involving multiple actors.
Quantum sensors are one of the technologies that could improve submarine
detection over the next two or three decades, and it is hence important
to consider their policy implications. [[**Quantum sensors** are
**unlikely** to increase]{.mark} submarine [**vulnerability** to the
point of]{.mark} [threatening **nuclear
deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but only if there is continued
research into these technologies. Though all nuclear-weapon states have
armed or are attempting to arm submarines with nuclear weapons, this
analysis uses the US-China dyad as a representative example. This dyad
is also relevant because it will see significant geopolitical
competition in the coming years, including in nuclear technologies.

Why submarines?

The United States currently fields 14 SSBNs, which can be armed with
about 50 per cent of its nuclear stockpile. The forthcoming
Columbia-class SSBNs will be in service until the 2070s. China is also
allotting more nuclear responsibilities to its forthcoming Type 096
submarines. Considering their longevity, studying technologies that
could threaten these expensive and seemingly indispensable vessels is
vital. The other eight nuclear weapon states (NWS) similarly field, or
hope to field, a second-strike capability on submarines. Submarine
survivability is crucial for NWS, and technology that threatens this
would negatively impact nuclear stability.

Until now, [[the relative **ease** of hiding submarines]{.mark} has
**[hindered]{.mark}** submarine [detection]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other
parts of the nuclear triad (air-, sea-, and land-based nuclear delivery
systems) could also be vulnerable; quantum sciences can improve
detection of stealth bombers and silo- and mobile-launched missiles.
However, as [[submarines are]{.mark} seen as [the **ultimate**]{.mark}
guarantors of a nuclear **[second-strike]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is
important to first study how quantum sensors would affect SSBN
operations.

It is important not to exaggerate submarine vulnerability --- [there
have always been [**fears** about '**transparent
oceans**']{.mark}]{.underline} leading to second-strike instability.
[These fears have [not materialised because]{.mark} of **[technological
constraints]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the United States still leads
compared to its adversaries in submarine and anti-submarine warfare.
This advantage stems from US successes in submarine quietening, as well
as using extremely sensitive acoustic sensors to locate other
submarines. The United States may be reaching the physical limits of
improving these sensors, while China and Russia are trying to quieten
their submarines further.

Submarine detection

Several quantum technology applications could aid detection of
submarines. These include magnetometers, gravity gradiometers and
quantum clocks. Simultaneously, quantum navigation could aid the
submarine to hide better.

[[Submarines can **protect** themselves from **magnetic** or
**acoustic** detection]{.underline}]{.mark}, but there are currently no
methods to shield against gravity gradiometers. Simply because such
methods have not been necessary so far. If these technologies become
more advanced, submarine designers may need to focus on reducing a
vessel's detectable gravity signature by optimizing mass distribution
during the design phase. However, retrofitting existing submarines to
account for this would be highly complex and could interfere with other
design optimizations. One could design ways to decrease the detectable
gravity signature by improving mass distribution on a submarines' hull.
That would need to happen at the already overly complex design stage of
a submarine.

Ultimately, [[while **quantum gravity gradiometers** could
**enhance**]{.mark} submarine [detection]{.mark}, [they are **unlikely**
to make oceans]{.mark} **fully [transparent]{.mark}** [or
eliminate]{.mark} the [**near-invulnerability** that submarines]{.mark}
currently [enjoy]{.mark}. [These **sensors** may]{.mark} first [be
deployed on **moving platforms**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as planes,
ships, or drones, but [they [will not]{.mark} entirely [**transform**
underwater warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Moving masses in a significant way on a vessel is not easy in itself and
might upset other optimisation efforts. States building new SSBNs today
would need to consider this in advance. Like magnetometers,
[**[quantum]{.mark}** gravity gradiometers]{.underline} will most likely
first be mounted on moving platforms like planes, ships or drones.
[[While **potentially** enhancing]{.mark} submarine
**[detection]{.mark}**, they [will not]{.mark} make oceans fully

Submarine Navigation

Beyond detection, [[the **gravimeter** could revolutionize submarine
**navigation**]{.underline}]{.mark} by enabling vessels to sense
underwater terrain and obstacles through gravitational mapping. [By
[detecting **gravitational shifts**]{.mark}, submarines can [**map**
their surroundings]{.mark} more **[effectively]{.mark}**, increasing
their ability to [navigate through **complex**]{.mark} [**underwater
terrains** without **surfacing**]{.mark}. This [offers a **substantial
strategic advantage**]{.mark} in military contexts, where stealth and
precision are paramount]{.underline}.

[[This]{.mark} capability [would **significantly** mitigate]{.mark} the
[risk of **accidents**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the USS Connecticut
incident, where a submarine collided with an underwater mountain. [By
providing a passive form of terrain detection]{.underline}, the
gravimeter allows submarines to navigate stealthily, eliminating the
need for active sonar, which could compromise their location. This
passive navigation method [[enhances the **strategic
operations**]{.mark} of submarines, [enabling them to
**traverse**]{.mark} complex underwater [environments without
**detection**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Chinese researchers have made notable strides in gravity detection
technology, developing a portable and highly sensitive atomic gravimeter
with promising applications in both submarine detection and navigation.

4.1.1. Physical changes

Substratum alterations are mainly created by equipment used for cable
route preparation (grapnels such as in the aforementioned PreLay Grapnel
Run) and installation of the cable (ploughing, jetting and
cutting-wheels). The surface area of disturbance can be enlarged when
installation techniques require large ships with several anchoring
stabilizers \[18\].

These methods of [[**reworking** the seabed may lead to]{.mark} **direct
[destruction]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} benthic
[habitats]{.mark}]{.underline}, flora and fauna. [[However]{.mark}, such
[effects are usually **restricted**]{.mark} to a limited
area]{.underline}, the width and intensity of disturbance, depending on
the installation method. For example, the footprint of a trenching
plough may vary from 2 to 8 m depending on device size \[5\]. According
to Vize et al. \[20\], [**[ploughing]{.mark}** methods seem to [cause
less **seabed disturbance**]{.mark}]{.underline} than other methods.
These [disturbances are usually [limited in **time**, as
installation]{.mark} works [only require a **few hours**]{.mark} or days
per km of cable]{.underline} \[21\]. [Ploughing and jetting methods
[favour a **quicker recovery**]{.mark} of bottom
topography]{.underline}, as the trench is filled with displaced and
re-suspended material immediately after digging and cable laying. In
intertidal areas, physical impacts on the substrate usually occur over a
larger surface area, of the order of tens of metres, due to the
utilisation of vehicles such as mechanical excavators (Fig. 4).
Alternatively, underground horizontal directional drilling (10 m below
the sediment surface) may be used in intertidal areas up to distances of
700--1000 m, and occasionally up to 1800 m \[18\]. This
[[installation]{.mark} technique [only **disturbs**]{.mark} the
substrate and [biota **locally**]{.mark} over a few m2 at the land and
sea entrance points]{.underline}.

Unburied cables may also cause habitat loss, but to a lesser extent than
buried cables. Disturbance is limited to the cable width itself, or to
the dimensions of the materials used to stabilise and protect \[22\]. In
shallow areas, some sections of unstabilised, unburied cables may act as
dragging elements that disturb the sediments due to their strumming
movement induced by the swell during the operation phase \[23\]. Wave
action may shift the cable, and direct interaction with the hard
seafloor can result in surface scraping and incisions in rock outcrops
\[13\]. Maintenance (to a lesser extent) and/or decommissioning phases
may generate similar effects to those of installation, but their
magnitude will depend on the duration and scale (repairs vs.
inspections) of the works.

With respect to other human activities at sea, [**[physical
disturbance]{.mark}** to the seabed [caused by cables is **spatially
limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the footprint of submarine
cables in the UK coastal area is about 0.3 km2 , representing less than
0.01% of the coastal seabed \[24\], whilst in the Basque Country coastal
zone (Northern Spain), the footprint of cables and pipelines is about
2.3 km2 , or 0.02% of the area between the coastline and the exclusive
economic zone \[25\].

4.5. Reef effect

Like other immersed objects (e.g. shipwrecks, oil/gas platforms, and MRE
devices) [unburied **[submarine cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
associated protection/ stabilisation [[can create **artificial
reefs**]{.underline}]{.mark}, inducing the so-called 'reef' effect
\[65\]. Artificial reefs have been [commonly used for centuries [to
**enhance fisheries**, and]{.mark} more recently [for **habitat
rehabilitation** or **coastal protection**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[66\].
These structures are [[colonised by]{.underline}]{.mark} hard-substrate
[**[benthic species]{.mark}** including epifauna and mobile
macrofauna]{.underline}, and may also attract mobile megafauna, such as
decapods or fishes.

The extent of the reef effect depends on the size and nature of the
cable protection structure, but also the characteristics of the
surrounding area and native populations \[65\]. Such artificial
structures are expected to have limited reef effects when located within
a naturally hard substratum environment. For example, Sherwood et al.
\[14\], looking at the effects of laying and operating the BassLink HVDC
cable, found that, 3.5-years after the cable installation, the benthic
sessile community present on the half-shell cover was similar to the
surrounding basalt reef area (Fig. 5A). Similar investigations showed no
significant differences between communities on powered cables and hard
bottom control areas \[9,12,67\]. By contrast, on soft sediments,
unburied cables generate a stronger reef effect and host a new
community, as illustrated by the unburied sections of the ATOC/Pioneer
cable (Half Moon Bay, California) colonised by actinarians \[13\]. In
this case, [[**sea anemones** became]{.mark} more [abundant on the
**cable**]{.mark} than on the surrounding soft bottom 8 years after
cable installation]{.underline} (Fig. 5B) and [[**fish species** were
more **abundant**]{.mark} close to the cable, probably [in **response**
to increased **habitat complexity**]{.mark} compared with the
surrounding environment]{.underline}.

['**[Reef effect]{.mark}**' [is]{.mark} usually [**considered** to be a
**positive**]{.mark} anthropogenic [impact]{.mark}, as **[artificial
reefs]{.mark}** generally [have **higher densities** and
**biomass**]{.mark} of fish and decapod crustaceans than surrounding
soft bottoms]{.underline}. Also, when associated with a fisheries
exclusion area (as described in Section 4.6) artificial reefs may
function as refuges for these populations, with potential spill-over
benefits for adjacent stocks and fisheries \[68\]. This is particularly
true for commercial species, like the European lobster (Homarus
gammarus) or edible crab (Cancer pagurus) observed on offshore wind-farm
foundations \[69,70\]. In some cases, [the [**cable reef effect**
is]{.mark} considered [a **compensatory** measure for habitat
**destroyed** during]{.mark} cable
**[installation]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[65\]. Concerning dynamic cables
used to connect offshore floating MRE projects, in addition to the
processes of colonisation and concentration, biofouling can
significantly increase cable weight and wear at least on the first tens
of metres, creating technical problems \[71\].

#### Sensors on [fiber-optic]{.underline} cables are the [ideal]{.underline} platform for [environmental monitoring]{.underline} in the Arctic.

Scarcity of continuous monitoring in the Arctic

Fibre sensing technologies can serve many applications beyond protection
of the cable itself. Due to the harsh conditions and associated high
costs, [scientific [monitoring of the **Arctic**]{.mark} region [is
**scarce**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore,
**[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}** from a range of disciplines [[are

[equip]{.mark}ped with **[sensors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Subsea
[**cables** are **ideal** platforms]{.mark} for sensors that contribute
to Research and Artic Ocean explorations]{.underline}. Scientific fields
which can benefit strongly from Arctic region sensing data
[[include]{.mark} geology, seismology, oceanography, **[marine
biology]{.mark}**, and **[climate research]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

"A full scientific sensor solution will mean more than just marginally
increased costs. This is because sensors will need power supply, and
transmission of their data will take more powerful repeaters, and
finally a fiber pair must be dedicated to this purpose," Wessing
comments.

These costs should be seen as an investment in obtaining a wealth of
scientific data which would otherwise be out of reach, says Wessing:

"For instance, [oceanographers and [**climate researchers** want data
for]{.mark} **water [temperatures]{.mark}**[,
**salinity**]{.mark}]{.underline} etc. Today, such data are mainly
obtained by operating buoys. This is an expensive solution and will
typically only give data for limited periods. [Subsea [cables with
**dedicated** sensors]{.mark} will [provide **continuous data**]{.mark}
and thereby [take **Arctic research** to a]{.mark}n entirely [new

**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**nergy Quantum Leadership Act would authorize
more than **[[\$2.5 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** for **[[quantum
research]{.underline}]{.mark}** conducted at DOE

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S.
Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) [today introduced **bipartisan legislation**
to expand the United States' capacity to invest in **quantum
information** science]{.underline} and research and development (R&D)
through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). As quantum science,
engineering, and technology advances, the DOE Quantum Leadership Act of
2025 would reinvigorate R&D projects at DOE by authorizing more than
\$2.5 billion in funding over the next five years---well above the \$625
million for DOE-related programs laid out in the now-expiredNational
Quantum Initiative Act of 2018. The DOE Quantum Leadership Act would
also provide DOE the authority to expand its current quantum R&D
initiatives.

"Between Fermilab and Argonne National Lab, our top-tier universities,
and the new Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, our state is
poised to be a global hub as quantum computing takes center stage. I
want to keep the momentum going by supporting the Department of Energy,
and in turn, Illinois' quantum researchers, in pioneering quantum
technologies that advance computing, security, and connectivity," said
Durbin. "Senator Daines and I are introducing the bipartisan DOE Quantum
Leadership Act to supercharge research, development, and
commercialization of quantum technologies---technologies that will grow
the medical, financial, and materials industries and create jobs along
the way. With this legislation, we can ensure our DOE facilities are
well-equipped to lead the quantum revolution."

"[[**America** is a **leader** in]{.mark} cutting-edge science and
**[technology]{.mark}**, and [in order to **maintain** our]{.mark}
strong [**position**, we must invest in **r**]{.mark}esearch [**and**
**d**]{.mark}evelopment projects]{.underline}. Spurring innovation
through the National Quantum Initiative Program will help strengthen our
national security, create Montana jobs and accelerate quantum research
projects," said Daines.

"We strongly support the leadership of Senators Durbin and Daines for
their re-introduction of the Department of Energy Quantum Leadership Act
at this critical moment for scaling and commercializing quantum
computing. PsiQuantum is already building the infrastructure for
utility-scale quantum systems, moving this technology towards
deployment," said Professor Jeremy O'Brien, co-founder and CEO of
PsiQuantum. "The Department of Energy is a critical partner to
PsiQuantum through our work with the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory and other national labs in collaboration across government
agencies. [[**Quantum technologies** will be **essential** for]{.mark}
economic **[competitiveness]{.mark}** and national security---advancing
**[defense]{.mark}**, securing [**critical infrastructure**, and]{.mark}
maintaining **[technological leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [By
strengthening the supply chain]{.underline}, expanding the workforce,
and accelerating deployment, this [legislation ensures the U.S. remains
at the **forefront** of this critical technology]{.underline}."

Specifically, the DOE Quantum Leadership Act would:

Reauthorize and expand R&D activities across DOE through 2030;

Build upon the foundational work of DOE's five National Research
Centers;

Direct DOE to study and address quantum supply chain challenges and
reduce barriers to commercialization;

Increase interagency and industry coordination; and

Establish new programs to support the workforce demands of the growing
quantum R&D and commercial ecosystems.

technological advancements," said Senator Luján. "This legislation would
create a commission to analyze and offer policy recommendations on
emerging quantum sciences and technologies to Congress. New Mexico is a
leader in U.S. quantum research, and this legislation will help drive
innovation and economic growth in our state."

**[Digitalization]{.underline}** is best conceptualized as a set of
layers (Montero & Finger, 2021): the first layer pertains to quite
traditional telecommunications infrastructures, such as copper
**[cables]{.underline}**, broadband, and fiber optic lines, as well as
mobile telecom infrastructures. For the sparsely populated and
geographically challenging Arctic, [rolling out telecommunications
infrastructures to create what is called "**connectivity**", i.e.,

[for them to be able to benefit]{.mark} from the **global

[[Indigenous press helps]{.mark} to reduce information gaps and
[**prevent misinformation** about Indigenous society]{.mark} and culture
among non-Indigenous peoples.]{.underline}

More recently[, [Indigenous individuals]{.mark} [and organizations have
investigated]{.mark}]{.underline} the [ways]{.underline} in which
[[social media]{.mark} affects Indigenous communities [and]{.mark} also
[**employ** it]{.mark} [for various purposes]{.mark},]{.underline}
including [[raising public awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bronwyn
Carlson and colleagues, for example, explore how [[Indigenous
Australians used social media to **create solidarity** for a campaign to
**counteract stereotypes** of Indigenous peoples]{.mark} propagated by
Australian med]{.underline}ia.[6 Leaked video footage and photos of
Indigenous youth being held in the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre in
Darwin, Australia]{.underline}---where they were being tortured with
tear gas, stripped naked, handcuffed, hooded, and strapped to a
chair---were [quickly shared]{.underline} on Facebook, Instagram, and
Twitter. The situation got worse when The Australian newspaper reacted
to the youth detention incident by publishing a cartoon of an officer
returning an Indigenous boy to his alcoholic father. The cartoon was
widely shared on social media, along with many racist comments looking
down upon Indigenous parents. In response to the situation, [[an
Indigenous father decided to tweet]{.mark} [an image]{.mark} of himself
with his children [to show how proud he is to be an Indigenous
father]{.mark} with the hashtag, #IndigenousDads. [The hashtag]{.mark}
[promptly became a powerful movement for]{.mark} other Indigenous
Australians to raise [public awarenes]{.mark}s. [Many]{.mark}
[Indigenous men participated]{.mark} in the social media campaign and
some posted tributes to their fathers and grandfathers.7]{.underline}

[This [real-world example demonstrates]{.mark} that **[social media can
be used to combat negative stereotypes]{.mark}** of Indigenous peoples
in media representation [and can contribute to]{.mark} what the authors
called a "[shared recognition" of Indigenous peoples' collective
indignation]{.mark} at such stereotypic representation. [Social media
**creates a space** where Indigenous peoples can **reinforce
pride**]{.mark} in Indigenous identity, [ask]{.mark} the public [for
**positive social change**, and **build resilience and
communi**ty]{.mark} capacity [to **help and support their own
peoples.**]{.mark}**8**]{.underline}

Another example of social-media utilization by Indigenous organizations
recently took place at the 2018 National Congress of American Indians
(NCAI). The goals of the NCAI are to increase engagement and raise
awareness between tribal nations, the US government, and the American
public, to further opportunities for success and advancement of Native
peoples, and to advance their nation-to-nation relationship with the
United States.9 The organizers began a social media campaign using the
hashtag #SOIN2018 ("State of Indian Nations 2018"). Event speeches were
broadcast live on the Internet and archived on the website. During the
event, audiences in the meeting room and at home were asked to share
photos with a few short messages mentioning that they were watching the
live broadcast of the National Congress of American Indians.
Participants were also encouraged to share information about the event
from NCAI's official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts and to
share their thoughts on personal social media platforms using the
hashtag #SOIN2018. This social media campaign was an excellent
opportunity to share information and educate both Indigenous and
non-Indigenous peoples about NCAI's State of Indian Nations project.

Given such campaigns' potential, a better understanding of the
conditions that exacerbate the digital divide could have a significant
impact on the well-being of Intahchomphoo \| Indigenous Peoples, Social
Media, and the Digital Divide 87 Indigenous populations who use social
media to mobilize their causes into action. The goal of this paper is to
examine the scholarly literature regarding how [[Indigenous peoples
around the world are using social media]{.underline},]{.mark} including
the Indigenous peoples of the United States and Canada, and from it [to
determine what role various factors play in that usage]{.underline},
including barriers to accessing technology, attitudes, skills, and usage
types---all of which make up the "digital divide," according to one
definition.10 Some elements of the literature also address whether
computer access and connectivity issues faced by Indigenous peoples
affect their use of social media.

geo-graphing the

The Han are not the only elites in the Biomes of Power who are
geo-graphing -- the [[Indo-Aryans]{.underline} [in New

"resource capturing" from Mayans]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the
Jungle.]{.underline} All of these geo-graphings are eerily reminiscent
of Mackinder\'s early twentieth-century agenda, yet none are "Western."
41

Second, when elites from the Biomes of Power exploit the people and
resources of peripheral regions, conflict often ensues. Again, Dalby
argues, "In some cases, this process (resource capture) may be connected
to state failure and political violence, especially in those developing
states in which insurgencies feed on grievances related to injustice and
inequity." 42 Resource capture, ecological marginalisation, injustice
and inequity have been the development model in the Americas for the
last five hundred years. For example, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Mexico, and the US, are controlled by the descendants of
European colonialists who violently seized the Biomes of Power for
themselves. Colonial Europeans forced indigenous peoples into the biomes
of marginality and conflict -- the highlands of Bolivia, the jungles of
Brazil, or the deserts of Mexico. In the United States, indigenous
peoples were relocated to deserts, semi-arid grasslands, Rocky Mountain
enclaves, the tundra, or on the margins of the northern boreal forests.
North American temperate hardwoods were violently seized by European
colonialists who then created the most powerful state in history -- the
United States of America. The Chinese, from temperate Beijing, exploit
the resources of the Tibetan highlands, western deserts, and southern
tropics, as well as extracting resources and exploiting the people in
several African countries.

Rather than arguing that the cause of poverty is related to "Northern"
corporate exploitation of the "South," we argue that it doesn\'t matter
that Barnett is an apologist for neo-liberalism, or that he is
hetero-patriarchical, what matters is that **[[geography
matters]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We argue that both Barnett and his
critics miss the point. [Elites]{.underline} in "metropoles" control the
Biomes of Power and [[exploit]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[people and
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Biomes of Conflict, [[even in

**[[The]{.mark} Strategic [Importance of Arctic]{.mark} Subsea
Cables]{.underline}**

International deep-sea submarine [[**cable** networks **provide 99% of
all global telecomm**]{.mark}**unication[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Arctic subsea cables have been a testament to this success,
**[providing]{.mark} greater [reliability]{.mark}** and **[increased
real-time data]{.mark} integration** across vast distances,
**[connecting continents]{.mark}** **like never before**]{.underline}.
Neatly put, [[the Arctic is a **vital region for internet
connectivity**]{.mark}, gaining the attention of countries, providers,
and other organizations involved in the telecommunications
industry.]{.underline}

As such, currently laid and future-planned Arctic subsea cables are
driven by rapid changes in the environment, geopolitical tensions, and
technological advancements. [Facing]{.underline} these
[**[factors]{.mark}** simultaneously **[creates new opportunities and
challenges for countries]{.mark}** and corporations vying for control
over these undersea networks.]{.underline}

Climate Change: Both a Challenge and a Catalyst

**[[The Arctic is]{.mark} an [unpredictable]{.mark} and harsh
environment]{.underline}**, making it a difficult place for long-term
infrastructure projects. [[Seasonal ice flows, extreme weather]{.mark}
conditions, [and fragile ecosystems]{.mark} present operational hazards
that can damage the cables or disrupt their installation]{.underline}.
An unfortunate example of this was seen in Alaska when an undersea fiber
optic line was ruptured by sheets of ice, causing mass telecom outages.

As such, [**[the cost of]{.mark} laying [cables]{.mark} in the Arctic
[is higher]{.mark}** than in temperate regions due to the possibility of
ice scraping against cables, unpredictable weather, and the difficulty
of making repairs if a line is damaged.]{.underline} Nevertheless,
**[[companies and gov]{.mark}ernment[s]{.mark} [are pushing
forward]{.mark} with their Arctic cable plans [due to the region's
strategic value]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And with [[the **rise of global
warming**]{.mark}, it [seems **we've hit a bittersweet point in time for
future Arctic subsea cables to be laid.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Far North [Fiber project is looking to utilize a current silver
lining when it comes to global warming]{.underline}. Typically, thick,
multiyear layers of ice make it nearly impossible to construct cable
lines, but [the rapid shrinking of ice layers during the summer
months]{.underline} which used to not be commonplace, means **[there is
a window of time to install the cables safely]{.underline}**. [These
cables will then be protected for a significant part of the year once
the ice returns in the colder season. Considering the amount of data and
speeds Arctic subsea cables can maintain, companies and stakeholders
alike agree the benefits of targeting this area for fiber optic growth
outweigh the risks.]{.underline}

Geopolitical Tensions and Security Concerns

[**[Arctic subsea cables]{.mark} have [proven]{.mark} their strategic
[importance for]{.mark} global tele[communication]{.mark}s,
[drawing]{.mark} the [attention of major]{.mark} global
[powers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With [massive amounts of data being shot
across these fiber optic lines,]{.underline} countries are investing
upwards of millions of dollars into the development and maintenance of
subsea cables. One such country is Canada, working to install multiple
Arctic subsea cables over the course of the next 10 years.

Some areas of the Arctic experience high traffic of commercial fishing
and boating, adding potentially harmful equipment to the already
abundant mix of possible environmental mishaps. This possibility was
taken into consideration when damage to submarine cables occurred in the
Nordic region -- but it wasn't the only possible cause.

The other side of the security coin is possible interference from
countries with different geopolitical standings and allies.

[Possible attacks are a high priority for governments to deter and
mitigate, as cyber-attacks and physical disruptions of fiber-optic
cables can affect both civilian and military communications. With many
countries seeking to utilize the Arctic for their communications, it is
imperative they also plan on the defensive to safehold Arctic subsea
cables that are put in place.]{.underline}

Technological Advancements

All great technology comes with even greater advancements, which is why
Arctic subsea cables are seeing pivotal developments and innovations. To
start, as a first line of cable defense, a lot of research has gone into
the development of more durable and resilient fiber optic cables as
these cables must endure extreme temperatures, ice movement, and strong
currents.

[[The use of]{.underline}]{.mark} Science Monitoring and Reliable
Telecommunications (**[[SMART]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [**[cables to
collect]{.mark} Earth and oceanic [data]{.mark}** has also been
demonstrated by research team]{.underline}s in North America, Asia, and
Europe. These [advanced cables integrate sensors with high bandwidth,
**[show]{.mark}ing great [potential to be used in]{.mark} multi-hazard
[warning systems]{.mark}**. Such advancements are not only beneficial to
the telecommunications infrastructure but also to communities that fall
within danger-prone areas.]{.underline}

Outside of the cables themselves, other technologies are being developed
to build and improve these deep-sea networks. Autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) improve precision and reduce human risk in challenging
environments, making them perfect for use in the laying and maintaining
of cables in the Arctic. Advancements in sensor technology are also on
the horizon, enabling real-time monitoring of cable conditions to spot
potential threats.

These innovations, combined with improvements in data transmission
capacity, are set to make Arctic subsea cables not only more resilient
but also more efficient in delivering faster, higher bandwidth
connections across continents.

Arctic Subsea Cables Are Not Solidified in Ice but in Our Telecom
Infrastructure

**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** subsea cables are [an [integral part
of]{.mark} global communication infrastructure, [strengthening]{.mark}
internet [connectivity and boosting]{.mark} the speed and
[capacity]{.mark} of global communications. They [require strategic
planning and creative, sustainable solutions to combat environmental and
geopolitical threats. Yet, the benefits of these cables far outweigh the
current obstacles]{.mark}, especially alongside technological
advancements. With companies and countries investing in what was once
considered an icy wasteland, the Arctic undoubtedly plays a crucial role
in the shaping and further development of global
communications.]{.underline}

Although pressures arising from economic protectionism and national
security concerns make the regulatory framework challenging, the
submarine fiber-optic cable industry is currently booming. At the same
time, the sector is going through a major transformation due to the
changes in the structure of cable ownership. However, it seems that
neither technological development nor the laying of tens or even
hundreds of thousands of kilometers of new submarine cables will
necessarily resolve the fundamental problems of the global cable
network. [New technology allows]{.underline} significant [increases in
carrying capacity, but]{.underline} it [does not change]{.underline} the
fact [that the **speed of transmission** depends on the **physical
length** of the cable. Similarly, the improvements in the **diversity**
and **robustness** of the **overall network** achieved through the **new
cable systems** remain minor, if they simply **follow the same routes**
utilized by other cables]{.underline} in the past.

The [Arctic]{.underline} fiber-optic [cable projects]{.underline} seem
to [offer solutions for **faster connections** and **greater
diversity**. However, they have not]{.underline}, at least [so far, been
able to solve]{.underline} the [general problems related to]{.underline}
the [establishment]{.underline} of new cable routes. The coming
years---perhaps even the coming months---will show whether the actors
behind the Arctic submarine fiber-optic cable initiatives manage to find
partners from each country involved and convince investors of the
technological and economic feasibility of their projects. Only after
solving the fundamental questions concerning project partners and
funding will we learn more about the flexibility and decision-making
ability of the Arctic countries and regions in such practical issues as
permits and zoning.

The [Arctic]{.underline} submarine [cable projects' **primary value** is
in their promise to **speed up connections** by generating **new links**
between nodes in the network(s)]{.underline} (that is, the value arises
from the links' relation to the overall global network of interactions).
They may generate new nodes as well, depending on for instance the
selection of landing sites. Moreover, they may generate additional links
when cables following the Arctic routes are connected to new nodes along
the shoreline. [This, again, will extend]{.underline} the technical, but
also metaphorical, [extent of the **global network**. Increased pace of
**transmission**]{.underline}, and the movement it enables, [will
further thicken global, overlapping networks]{.underline} of political,
economic, religious, judicial, and cultural interaction. Simultaneously,
improved communication coverage will connect the Arctic firmer to the
global network of exchanges, which may or may not serve the interests of
local communities as well. For certain, it will disseminate and
integrate network thinking in to the minds of people.

China has made a significant foray into the Arctic with the creation of
a data "silk road". Strongly supported by a newfound closeness with
Russia, preliminary planning of a Chinese and Finnish--led trans-Arctic
cable along the Arctic's Northeast Passage in partnership with Japan and
Norway is underway. But the project, essentially a relaunch of a
stagnated Russian initiative, presents stark risks in affording Moscow
and Beijing potential influence over global telecommunications.

Sea cables 101

Contrary to popular belief, satellites carry very little global data.
**[[Sea cables have been an important method of global
communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the mid-19th century. The
advent of fibre optics in the 1990s made modern sea cabling even more
critical. This vast network, comprising some one million kilometres in
total, carries almost all data transfers and, according to a recent
report, facilitates finance transfers of more than \$10 trillion dollars
every day.

Beyond the significance to the global financial market, sea cables
[[**transfer** nearly **all**]{.mark} our global [telecommunications
data]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These cables are a matter of **crucial
national security**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

[[Historically]{.underline}]{.mark}, sea [[cables]{.underline}]{.mark}
[have only been [vulnerable to damage from]{.mark} threats related to
fisheries, [anchors, earthquakes, and tsunamis]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Being relatively void of these challenges, at least for now, the Arctic
offers a unique environment for sea cables. But the increasingly
assertive foreign policy agendas of some states means that these cables
are at risk of purposeful interference, as per the emerging "hybrid"
security threat.

[[Russia]{.mark} has [already demonstrated]{.mark} interest and [ability
in exploiting]{.mark} sea [cable vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In 2013, little green men cut the sea cable between Crimea and Ukraine
-- a crucial step in controlling the internet within the annexed
territory.

Advantages of an Arctic route

[The **[thawing Arctic presents]{.mark} an [attractive sea cable
route]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** [A trans-Arctic sea cable [cuts the
distance between Asia and Europe **by roughly 40%.**]{.mark} The
[shorter]{.mark} the physical cable [distance, the lower the
latency]{.mark}]{.underline} ([total round-trip data transmission
time]{.underline}). [[Melting ice]{.underline}]{.mark} and developments
in technology have [[prompted]{.mark} a [range of feasibility
studies]{.mark} into the viability of a trans-Arctic sea cable
route]{.underline}. Arctic Council permanent members Canada, Russia, the
US, Norway, and Denmark have all, to varying degrees, undertaken
assessments of potential Arctic data highways

The [[Arctic]{.mark}'s **previously unthinkable** thaws]{.underline}
will [[present a]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[sweet spot]{.mark}** where
it's [now accessible]{.mark} and [allows]{.mark}]{.underline} us a
[[time window]{.mark}]{.underline} when [we [can get]{.mark} the
**[cable]{.mark} safely [installed]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Ik Icard,
chief strategy officer at Far North Digital, told Politico.

[**[Far North Fiber]{.underline}**'s]{.mark} backers claim that, [once
constructed]{.underline}, their [cable [would]{.mark} also be **[better
protect]{.mark}ed** [compared to]{.mark} similar [lines
**elsewhere**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}. An estimated 100 to 150
lines are damaged every year globally, be it from accidental encounters
with boat anchors and fishing equipment, or due to intentional sabotage.

The [**[threat of sabotage]{.mark}** is]{.underline} an [[increasing
concern]{.underline}]{.mark} to the telecom companies overseeing deep
sea cable systems. More than [**90 percent** of all Europe-Asia data
traffic **travels along cables** within the Red Sea trading
corridor]{.underline}. Thanks to a [recent increase]{.underline} in the
region's [[geopolitical]{.mark} **[unrest and
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [cable [lines face greater
**risk**]{.mark} **of damage**]{.underline}. Just last month, three such
lines were cut during ongoing Houthi rebel attacks on nearby shipping
vessels.

Company representatives believe [**[establishing]{.mark}** a [new
route]{.mark}]{.underline} through the Northwest Passage could
[**[avoid]{.mark} similar [issues]{.mark}** in the
future]{.underline}---at an estimated cost of €1 billion (\$1.08
billion). That's about four times the cost of laying a cable across the
Atlantic Ocean, and around three times as much to do so in the Pacific.
But despite the exponential price tag, the European Union has signaled
its interest with a €23 million [[**investment** in]{.mark} Far North
[Fiber]{.mark}]{.underline}. The project's developers also hope to
convince the US and Canada to get involved.

"[[Nobody wants to **cut**]{.mark} **a [cable]{.mark}** [under]{.mark}
the [ice]{.mark}, it's [**really hard** to do]{.mark}]{.underline}," Far
North Digital co-founder Ethan Berkowitz said.

[As]{.underline} the receding [[ice conditions allow]{.mark}
for]{.underline} (relatively) [[**safer navigation** along]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}'s waterways**]{.underline} for longer periods of time
[[and]{.mark} **[technological progression]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
development of smart submarines [continues]{.underline} unabatedly, a
[cable race seems to have begun]{.underline} to take hold in the region;
a [development]{.underline} that could [turn]{.underline} the
[**[region]{.mark}'s maritime domain** into]{.underline} a
[[critical]{.mark} global **[data chokepoint]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
its part, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [is
[currently]{.mark}]{.underline} in the midst of [[fine-tuning]{.mark}
its **[High North strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, needs to [**recognize
the [importance]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [**region**
as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**emerging [global data]{.mark}** nerve
**[centre]{.mark}**]{.underline} and devise a well-defined plan for the
protection of these cables. [[Failure]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so
[would **[jeopardise]{.mark}**]{.underline} the Alliance's air, land and
naval [[operations]{.underline}]{.mark} and/or presence [in the
region]{.underline}.

[**[Arctic cables matter]{.mark}** for a number of reasons]{.underline}.
They are [**[considerably shorter]{.mark}** than]{.underline} those that
traverse through [the **established routes** like the Suez Canal and the
Strait of Malacca]{.underline}. Hence, they [tend to [substantially
increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**speed of data**
transfer]{.underline}]{.mark} between Europe, Asia and North America.
They are [also [**less vulnerable** to malfunctioning]{.mark} and/or
interruption]{.underline}. Only a handful of states have the required
capabilities for carrying out sabotage operations in the Arctic Ocean
while the lower volume of vessel' traffic as well as the
[[Arctic's]{.mark} own **[geological specificities]{.mark}**
[reduce]{.mark} the likelihood of [damage]{.mark} by either anchors or
undersea earthquakes.]{.underline}

Thanks to their [ability to **[accelerate intercontinental]{.mark} data
[transfers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, moreover,
[operationalisation]{.underline} of these cables [would **directly
[benefit industries]{.mark}** such as telecommunication, space, and
defence]{.underline}. In a sense, subsea cables are [[nothing short of
strategic]{.mark} and **intelligence assets**]{.underline} that enable
countries which control them, or through whose territories they pass, to
[[**intercept**]{.mark} data, better **[defend]{.mark}** [and
monitor]{.mark} the **global [cyberspace]{.mark}**, and
**[develop]{.mark}** their space [industries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Tronsrue explained why [[Alaska's position]{.mark} on the globe
[is]{.mark} so **[critical]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "When you look at the

**centrality**]{.mark} is what [will drive future phases
of]{.mark}]{.underline} Quintillion's [[network]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Quintillion plans to start building a Trans-Pacific Cable System, with a
subsea cable extending from Japan to Washington State (JAWS), which will
land on Native American land located on the shores of the Olympic
Peninsula. The system will connect by Quintillion operated fiber to its
Alaska network at existing points of presence (POP's) in both Seattle,
Washington and Hillsboro, Oregon. Importantly, this establishes a new
transpacific network serving Japan and pan Asian markets and offers a
diverse, redundant route to the market. As most of today's trans-pacific
subsea routes land in California or Oregon -- there hasn't been a route
connecting to Washington State in over 20 years. This work has been
underway for several years and Quintillion plans to start the project in
early 2023 and complete in 2025 or later, depending on various factors.
The next stage is also in planning and contemplated to start sometime in
2023, based upon government support from US, Canada and Denmark. The
intent is to build [[an Arctic subsea system **originating in
Alaska**]{.mark}]{.underline} with potential landings in Canada, and
then extending to Greenland and Iceland, [[using]{.mark} a low-latency,
[**unique route** that]{.mark} further [connects]{.mark} the [North
America]{.mark}n Arctic [to the rest of the world]{.mark}.
**[Interconnecting systems]{.mark}** from the North American Arctic to

#### Installing cables in the Arctic is strategic\-\--they will be protected under a layer of ice during the winter, which minimizes disruptions

and 3 Factors Impacting Them";
https://www.geo-tel.com/3-factors-impacting-arctic-subsea-cables/\]

As such, [the cost of laying cables in the Arctic is higher than in
temperate regions]{.underline} due to the possibility of ice scraping
against cables, unpredictable weather, and the difficulty of making
repairs if a line is damaged. [Nevertheless, co[mpanies and governments
are **pushing forward** with their Arctic cable plans due to the]{.mark}
region's **[strategic value]{.mark}**. And [with the rise of global
warming]{.mark}, it seems we've hit a]{.underline} bittersweet [point in
time for future Arctic subsea cables to be laid.]{.underline} The Far
North Fiber project is looking to utilize a current silver lining when
it comes to global warming. Typically, thick, multiyear layers of ice
make it nearly impossible to construct cable lines, but [[the]{.mark}
rapid [shrinking of ice]{.mark} layers [during the summer]{.mark}
months]{.underline} which used to not be commonplace, [[means there is a
**window of time** to install]{.mark} the [cables]{.mark} safely. These
[cables **will**]{.mark} **then [be protected]{.mark}** for a
significant part of the year [once the ice returns]{.mark} in the colder
season. [Considering the amount of]{.mark} [data and speeds

Today, no submarine optical fiber cables lie on [[the Arctic]{.mark}
Ocean floor, despite th[is]{.mark} being [the **shortest way** to link
Asia, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [and Europe]{.mark} by
water]{.underline}, a distance of some 16,000 km. To date, ice and
icebergs have sufficiently hampered navigation to make cable laying a
dangerous prospect. However, the [**accelerated [melting]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the polar [ice]{.mark} cap [opens]{.mark} [new
prospects]{.mark},]{.underline} not for raw materials or new maritime
routes for commercial shipping, but [for telecommunications companies
[to open]{.mark} the Northwest ([NWP]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} Northern Sea
Route ([NSR]{.mark}). The latter route [is]{.mark} as much as **[7000 km
shorter]{.mark}** than the NWP, [which]{.mark} [means]{.mark} not only
less cables to lay, but also a **[shorter latency]{.mark}** for
communications.]{.underline} This latency gain is of high interest to
financial institutions (Clayton, 2012), particularly those involved in
high frequency trading (Morand, 2012). [Russian and Canadian projects
are promising [latency reductions]{.mark} [of 30%,]{.mark} which
[represents a gain of 62 milliseconds]{.mark}, going from the current
230 milliseconds to 168 milliseconds.2 Given that milliseconds [can mean
the]{.mark} loss or **[gain of millions of dollars]{.mark}** (Anthony,
2012), there is little wonder that the new plans for Arctic cable have
**attracted the interest of traders**.]{.underline} The Arctic route has
other advantages as well. Since [[the region has yet to be
developed]{.mark}, there is for the moment little commercial shipping or
fishing, [which **reduces the risk of damage to cables from
anchors**]{.mark} or fishing lines,]{.underline} as was the case off the
coast of Egypt (Saffo, 2013). [[The Arctic]{.mark} route also [**avoids
high-risk security areas** such as the Suez]{.mark} [Canal]{.mark} or
the Strait of Malacca. [The Arctic is]{.mark} seen as [a stable]{.mark}
[area for development]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, despite a few
(managed) border disagreements between Canada and the US, and Canada and
Denmark, and despite the RussianCanadian diplomatic tensions in the
context of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, nothing today points to an
armed conflict or a military crisis in the Arctic.

importance of data sharing capacity. As the demand for data intensive
research grows, the influence of the Research and Education Networks
(REN) is expanding. [**Submarine [cables]{.mark}** [provide]{.mark} the
**necessary [high-capacity]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **long-distance
[connections ]{.mark}**that enable global collaboration and data
sharing.]{.underline} The active role played by NORDUnet, managing and
operating a regional network and connecting the Nordic countries to
other international research networks, is a prime example of REN's
capabilities. The government-backed RENs also offer a possibility for
public authorities to be involved in and support submarine cable
projects they consider strategically important. Initiatives such as the
HANAMI (HPC AlliaNce for Applications and supercoMputing Innovation)
project, bringing together research teams representing excellence in
High-Performance Computing from both Europe and Japan, can also be
showcased when arguing on behalf of the new Arctic routes among European
and Japanese RENs.

In general, the envisioned [users of the **[trans-Arctic
cables]{.mark}** have [remained]{.mark} the same [although]{.mark} the
projects and [route options have changed]{.mark}]{.underline}. However,
the [[increasing]{.mark} [attention]{.mark} paid [to **SMART
cable**]{.mark} **initiatives** [and]{.mark} security [aspects]{.mark}
seem [reflect]{.mark} the recent [tendency]{.mark}]{.underline} to
emphasize the need for collaboration between private and public authors.
Yet, this kind approach is also echoing older projects like Arctic Fibre
that assumed a significant public funding especially from the Government
of Canada (Starosielski 2015, Bennett 2016). When lobbying the Arctic
SMART cables, attention should be paid to different stakeholder that
need to be convinced. While the **[[Arctic]{.mark} research
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline}** should be [[approached]{.mark} with
a message underlining the [benefits of]{.mark} the **SMART
[technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} when compared to other observation
and data collection methods, potential funding agencies and regulatory
authorities are surely expecting proofs concerning cost-efficiency and
technological feasibility, for example. If the **[[Arctic]{.mark}
connectivity [projects]{.mark}]{.underline}** are to be
[[promoted]{.mark} among **military [authorities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and other national security concerns, one should [underline the
[**geopolitical significance** of]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the [modern warfare [and]{.mark}
intelligence gatherings' dependency on well-functioning and
**[robust]{.mark} digital [infrastructure]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Today, no submarine optical fiber cables lie on [[the Arctic]{.mark}
Ocean floor, despite th[is]{.mark} being [the **shortest way** to link
Asia, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [and Europe]{.mark} by
water]{.underline}, a distance of some 16,000 km. To date, ice and
icebergs have sufficiently hampered navigation to make cable laying a
dangerous prospect. However, the [**accelerated [melting]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the polar [ice]{.mark} cap [opens]{.mark} [new
prospects]{.mark},]{.underline} not for raw materials or new maritime
routes for commercial shipping, but [for telecommunications companies
[to open]{.mark} the Northwest ([NWP]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} Northern Sea
Route ([NSR]{.mark}). The latter route [is]{.mark} as much as **[7000 km
shorter]{.mark}** than the NWP, [which]{.mark} [means]{.mark} not only
less cables to lay, but also a **[shorter latency]{.mark}** for
communications.]{.underline} This latency gain is of high interest to
financial institutions (Clayton, 2012), particularly those involved in
high frequency trading (Morand, 2012). [Russian and Canadian projects
are promising [latency reductions]{.mark} [of 30%,]{.mark} which
[represents a gain of 62 milliseconds]{.mark}, going from the current
230 milliseconds to 168 milliseconds.2 Given that milliseconds [can mean
the]{.mark} loss or **[gain of millions of dollars]{.mark}** (Anthony,
2012), there is little wonder that the new plans for Arctic cable have
**attracted the interest of traders**.]{.underline} The Arctic route has
other advantages as well. Since [[the region has yet to be
developed]{.mark}, there is for the moment little commercial shipping or
fishing, [which **reduces the risk of damage to cables from
anchors**]{.mark} or fishing lines,]{.underline} as was the case off the
coast of Egypt (Saffo, 2013). [[The Arctic]{.mark} route also [**avoids
high-risk security areas** such as the Suez]{.mark} [Canal]{.mark} or
the Strait of Malacca. [The Arctic is]{.mark} seen as [a stable]{.mark}
[area for development]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, despite a few
(managed) border disagreements between Canada and the US, and Canada and
Denmark, and despite the RussianCanadian diplomatic tensions in the
context of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, nothing today points to an
armed conflict or a military crisis in the Arctic.

[[Avoiding]{.underline}]{.mark} areas of
**[[congestion]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Looking at the [globe from the **North Pole**]{.underline}, it is
[[**obvious** that]{.mark} a route through **the [Arctic
region]{.mark}** is the **[shortest]{.mark}**]{.underline} between
Northern Europe and Asia. Further, since the [two [connections]{.mark}
will [**pass** through]{.mark} **[virgin
territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, they will be [**fully
[independent]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} **currently [congested
regions]{.mark}.**]{.underline} . For instance, the [[existing
route]{.mark}]{.underline} through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea area
is used by multiple connections which [[is]{.mark} a **[high-risk
factor]{.mark}**, [even if]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in that region [had [not
existed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Two connections are being detailed in the report. [**[Far North
Fiber]{.mark}** is [intended to]{.mark}]{.underline} link Europe and
Japan through the North-West Passage between Greenland and Northern
Canada, while Polar Connect is to [[follow]{.mark} a **[more direct
route]{.mark}**, passing [under]{.mark} the [ice cap]{.mark} of the
**North Pole**, [towards]{.mark} **[N]{.mark}**orth **[A]{.mark}**merica

[As]{.underline} the receding [[ice conditions allow]{.mark}
for]{.underline} (relatively) [[**safer navigation** along]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}'s waterways**]{.underline} for longer periods of time
[[and]{.mark} **[technological progression]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
development of smart submarines [continues]{.underline} unabatedly, a
[cable race seems to have begun]{.underline} to take hold in the region;
a [development]{.underline} that could [turn]{.underline} the
[**[region]{.mark}'s maritime domain** into]{.underline} a
[[critical]{.mark} global **[data chokepoint]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
its part, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [is
[currently]{.mark}]{.underline} in the midst of [[fine-tuning]{.mark}
its **[High North strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, needs to [**recognize
the [importance]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [**region**
as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**emerging [global data]{.mark}** nerve
**[centre]{.mark}**]{.underline} and devise a well-defined plan for the
protection of these cables. [[Failure]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so
[would **[jeopardise]{.mark}**]{.underline} the Alliance's air, land and
naval [[operations]{.underline}]{.mark} and/or presence [in the
region]{.underline}.

[**[Arctic cables matter]{.mark}** for a number of reasons]{.underline}.
They are [**[considerably shorter]{.mark}** than]{.underline} those that
traverse through [the **established routes** like the Suez Canal and the
Strait of Malacca]{.underline}. Hence, they [tend to [substantially
increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**speed of data**
transfer]{.underline}]{.mark} between Europe, Asia and North America.
They are [also [**less vulnerable** to malfunctioning]{.mark} and/or
interruption]{.underline}. Only a handful of states have the required
capabilities for carrying out sabotage operations in the Arctic Ocean
while the lower volume of vessel' traffic as well as the
[[Arctic's]{.mark} own **[geological specificities]{.mark}**
[reduce]{.mark} the likelihood of [damage]{.mark} by either anchors or
undersea earthquakes.]{.underline}

Thanks to their [ability to **[accelerate intercontinental]{.mark} data
[transfers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, moreover,
[operationalisation]{.underline} of these cables [would **directly
[benefit industries]{.mark}** such as telecommunication, space, and
defence]{.underline}. In a sense, subsea cables are [[nothing short of
strategic]{.mark} and **intelligence assets**]{.underline} that enable
countries which control them, or through whose territories they pass, to
[[**intercept**]{.mark} data, better **[defend]{.mark}** [and
monitor]{.mark} the **global [cyberspace]{.mark}**, and
**[develop]{.mark}** their space [industries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Litany of reasons.

The [[Arctic]{.mark}'s **previously unthinkable** thaws]{.underline}

[**[Far North Fiber]{.underline}**'s]{.mark} backers claim that, [once

**elsewhere**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}. An estimated 100 to 150
lines are damaged every year globally, be it from accidental encounters

The [**[threat of sabotage]{.mark}** is]{.underline} an [[increasing
concern]{.underline}]{.mark} to the telecom companies overseeing deep
sea cable systems. More than [**90 percent** of all Europe-Asia data
traffic **travels along cables** within the Red Sea trading
corridor]{.underline}. Thanks to a [recent increase]{.underline} in the
region's [[geopolitical]{.mark} **[unrest and
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [cable [lines face greater
**risk**]{.mark} **of damage**]{.underline}. Just last month, three such
lines were cut during ongoing Houthi rebel attacks on nearby shipping
vessels.

Company representatives believe [**[establishing]{.mark}** a [new
route]{.mark}]{.underline} through the Northwest Passage could
[**[avoid]{.mark} similar [issues]{.mark}** in the
future]{.underline}---at an estimated cost of €1 billion (\$1.08
billion). That's about four times the cost of laying a cable across the
Atlantic Ocean, and around three times as much to do so in the Pacific.
But despite the exponential price tag, the European Union has signaled
its interest with a €23 million [[**investment** in]{.mark} Far North
[Fiber]{.mark}]{.underline}. The project's developers also hope to
convince the US and Canada to get involved.

Quantum technology [leadership [enhances]{.mark} **overall [national

mean falling behind in vital sectors, from energy to pharmaceuticals to
material design and agriculture. Given its prospective impact[,
[quantum]{.mark} has become a [**key battleground** in]{.mark} the
technology [competition between]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [**[first-mover
benefits]{.mark}** associated with quantum technologies [are
substantial]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The first country [to
**[scale, commercialize, and integrate]{.mark} quantum will unlock a
toolkit of capabilities**---such as the ability to crack public key
encryption or conduct complex surveillance operations---that non-quantum
equipped adversaries will struggle to counter. The country leading in
quantum also will possess science and engineering expertise that is
extremely difficult to cultivate and could take competitors years to

**shape**]{.mark} **governance [frameworks]{.mark}** that influence
whether quantum technologies are **[used to]{.mark} promote or

action]{.underline} to boost America's quantum competitiveness, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[risks repeating mistakes]{.mark}**
made in the race to develop and deploy 5G technology]{.underline}. The
United States' [failure to outpace China]{.underline} in 5G [means that
Chinese firms now connect 80 percent of global 5G devices]{.underline},
maintain 70 percent of 5G base stations, and hold one third of
5G-related "standard-essential" patents. At a minimum, this
China-dominated ecosystem challenges U.S. companies' ability to compete
abroad, complicates the United States' ability to partner with countries
dependent on potentially compromised Chinese infrastructure, and reduces
U.S. influence over the ways in which 5G technologies are employed. The
United States can leverage several advantages to avoid a similar outcome
in quantum. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is [widely considered
the global leader]{.mark} in two of the three quantum technology
subsets]{.underline}---quantum [computing]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
quantum [sensing]{.underline}---thanks to its [cohesive national quantum
strategy, top-notch research facilities, diverse quantum industry, high
private investment, and consistent output of quality quantum-relevant
publications]{.underline}. But China is closing the gap. The Chinese
Communist Party pours dramatically more public funding into general
quantum technology research and development (R&D) than the United
States, Chinese researchers publish more frequently than their U.S.
counterparts, and Chinese scientists have achieved several notable
technical breakthroughs. [[China is already using its dominance in the
third]{.mark} quantum technology [subset]{.mark}]{.underline}---quantum
[communications]{.underline}---[to support broader geopolitical
objectives]{.underline}. In January 2024, Chinese scientists announced
the establishment of a 3,800-kilometer quantum network connecting Urumqi
to Moscow, Russia. China and Russia reportedly plan to expand the
network to Brazil, India, and South Africa, which would render
communications and data sharing between the BRICS partners unbreakable.

[ENHANCED DETECTION AND DOMAIN AWARENESS]{.underline} The distinct but
interrelated [**[disciplines of quantum radar]{.mark}**, sensing,
imaging, metrology, and navigation]{.underline} have **[[direct]{.mark}
and significant [military applications]{.mark}]{.underline}** that could
[make possible **[enhance]{.mark}d situational [awareness]{.mark}** [in
**all domains**]{.mark} **of warfare**]{.underline}. The "spooky"
[[properties]{.mark} of quantum]{.underline} physics can be [employed to
[**achieve a degree of precision** that goes **far beyond**]{.mark} the
**capabilities of classical technologies**]{.underline}. As the future
operating environment becomes ever more chaotic and complex, these
[**[new tools]{.mark} could [provide]{.mark} a key [edge for
China]{.mark}** [as it]{.mark} seeks to expand its sensing and
surveillance capabilities in the near seas and beyond]{.underline}. In
particular, [as the electromagnetic spectrum becomes increasingly
crowded in times of peace and contested in times of war, the ability to
ensure trust in sensors and operate independently of the spectrum's
limitations will be critical for timing, sensing, and
navigation]{.underline}. For instance, [**quantum** clocks could
**[generate greater precision]{.mark} in timing**, **[critical to modern
military operations]{.mark}**, while quantum imaging and sensing could
enhance future sensors]{.underline}. If operationalized, quantum radar
[could have the potential to overcome superior U.S. stealth capabilities
through its extreme sensitivity]{.underline}, perhaps
**[[enabling]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to **[[undermine this critical pillar of U.S. military
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. PLA media has highlighted [quantum radar
as the "nemesis" of today's stealth fighter planes that will have
"remarkable potential" on the future battlefield]{.underline},279 while
the development of "ghost imaging" satellites has been characterized as
potentially capable of seeing through stealth to overcome the 'fog' of
the battlefield.280 In addition, certain descriptions of [quantum radar
**even suggest that it would be able to defeat radar jamming
techniques** such as digital **radio frequency** memory **jammers**,
which spoof a radar's broadcasted **signal to conceal an aircraft's true
location**]{.underline}.281 At present, it remains difficult to evaluate
the timeframe within which quantum sensing and imaging will become a
reality beyond the laboratory in a military context (or whether that
would be publicly disclosed), including the challenges of
miniaturization.282 Certainly, China's claims to have developed
prototypes for quantum radar and quantum remote sensing should be met
with some skepticism. Nevertheless, beyond the hype and enthusiasm,
there appears to be broad consensus in the research community that these
capabilities could become feasible eventually.283 Nonetheless, **[[even
the distant possibility of China developing]{.mark} sensing and imaging
[technologies capable of overcoming stealth]{.mark} merits consideration
[as a major disruption to]{.mark} the current [military
balance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Chinese strategists recognize that
[developing and deploying these systems early could enable China to
achieve an initiative on future battlefields]{.underline}.284 In any
conflict with China, [the use of stealth would be a strategic imperative
for the United States, critical to aircraft penetrating Chinese airspace
to hold Chinese operational assets at risk]{.underline}. Therefore,
[quantum radar and imaging could be massive disruptive
force]{.underline} -- an "[offset technology]{.underline}" -- within the
PLA's suite of so-called anti-access/area denial or
"counter-intervention" capabilities. If operationalized successfully,
these new types of sensing could not only undermine the U.S. advantage
in stealth but also increase the likely costs of war, forcing the United
States to accept higher levels of operational risk -- and perhaps, at
worst, someday nullifying billions of dollars spent on stealth for
platforms operating in the Indo-Pacific. Given this risk, **[[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark}]{.underline}** closely
**[[monitor]{.underline}]{.mark}** Chinese developments in these
technologies and should recognize that stealth might not be an assured
advantage in a future conflict scenario.285 **[[At the same time,
quantum]{.mark}]{.underline}** navigation and positioning**[,
[already]{.mark} relatively [mature as technologies]{.mark}, could
[provide]{.mark} a new and [valuable option for navigation]{.mark}. This
"new generation of inertial navigation" will [enable
high-precision]{.mark} navigation without GPS, including for the
[guidance]{.mark} of precision weapon systems]{.underline}**.286 This
so-called "quantum compass" would be particularly useful for submarines
and other maritime platforms, allowing them to determine their position
with high levels of accuracy, without reliance upon satellites that
might be taken out in a conflict scenario.287 The PLA intends to ensure
that next-generation submarines will be equipped with quantum
navigation, giving them independence from space-based positioning
systems, which can be easily jammed.288 Indeed, Fan Guoping (范国平) of
the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation has highlighted: A missile
can be positioned with the help of satellite navigation; what if it is
subject to interference? A nuclear submarine is hidden under water, but
after a period of time it needs to ascend into a calibration position;
what do \[we\] do about it being detected?

### Advantage CP\-\--Quantum Key\-\--2AC

#### Quantum is key -- [quick repair]{.underline} and [info gathering]{.underline} deter aggressors.

Bruce **Jones 25**, a senior fellow at the Strobe Talbott Center on
Security, Strategy and Technology at the Brookings Institution, \"A New
Era of Undersea Conflict Is Here\", Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/21/undersea-cables-sabotage-hybrid-conflict-deterrence/,
3-21-25//ILake-AW

[The first deterrence strategy is **denial through improved
resilience**]{.underline}. [Whatever]{.underline} [the effects
an]{.underline} offending state or nonstate [entity is hoping to attain
by interfering with a submarine cable]{.underline}, [the ability to
**swiftly repair**]{.underline} a break, [and]{.underline} to
[maintain]{.underline} [service through **rerouting**, will **mitigate**
the impact]{.underline} of the break [and]{.underline} thus
**[limit]{.underline}** the [reward for aggression]{.underline}. Even if
the adversary is interfering with cable as part of a larger and longer
campaign, efforts to restore service may be useful as well.

[Second is "**deterrence by detection**]{.underline}": [greater
visibility]{.underline} can [help]{.underline} [to]{.underline} "**[deny
deniability]{.underline}**." As James Bergeron, political advisor to
NATO Allied Maritime Command, has noted: "If a malefactor is going to
try to harass, undermine or clandestinely attack offshore infrastructure
... [the]{.underline} main [thing we seek]{.underline} to achieve [is
that they cannot get away with it]{.underline}. [Instead, they will be
spotted]{.underline}, the cameras will be snapping, the [underwater
sensors will be **monitoring**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [there
will]{.underline} be [a signals **trail of liability**]{.underline}."

[Better detection will require]{.underline} fast-tracking [the adoption
of advanced technologies]{.underline}, [**quantum sensors**
collecting]{.underline} [data]{.underline} [for processing]{.underline},
underwater robotic systems, and the application of artificial
intelligence to sensing data. Each can be used to enhance what we might
call deterrence by detection. But more reason for the United States and
its Western partners to move quicky: Whichever country manages to master
emerging undersea technologies will have first mover advantages over its
competitors. It will be able to harvest more data and interfere,
undetected and undeterred, with undersea critical infrastructure by
means unavailable to other states.

[[The integration of **quantum sensors** into]{.mark} global
[**military** and **intelligence**]{.mark} communication systems [is set
to **revolutionize** how **sensitive information** is
transmitted]{.mark} and protected]{.underline}. Quantum technologies,
especially Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), offer unparalleled security
and performance benefits that directly address the vulnerabilities of
current communication networks used by defense and intelligence
agencies. [[As **global adversaries** adopt]{.mark} more [**advanced**
cyber capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, including quantum computing,
[the need for **[quantum-secured]{.mark}** communication [systems
becomes critical]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of the most immediate and
significant impacts of quantum sensors on military and intelligence
communications is the enhanced security offered by quantum encryption.
QKD ensures that communication channels are virtually impervious to
eavesdropping or interception. With traditional encryption methods
expected to become obsolete once quantum computers are fully
operational, military and intelligence agencies face a serious threat to
the confidentiality of their communications. Quantum sensors, through
their ability to detect any attempt at interception, ensure that any
eavesdropping effort is immediately discovered, allowing the system to
prevent the transmission of sensitive information before a breach occurs
\[25\]. This is especially important for global military operations
where secure communication between allied nations and remote command
centers is vital for strategic success.

[[For **military operations**]{.mark}, [quantum]{.mark}-secured
fiber-optic networks [provide **secure channels** for]{.mark}
transmitting **critical data**, such as **[troop movements]{.mark}**,
[**battlefield intelligence**, and **drone coordination**]{.mark}.
[Traditional]{.mark} communication [networks are **vulnerable**]{.mark}

**active conflict** zones]{.mark} where adversaries deploy sophisticated
electronic warfare tactics. **[Quantum sensors]{.mark}** embedded in
these networks [**mitigate** these risks by **monitoring** the **quantum
states** of]{.mark} transmitted **[photons]{.mark}**, [ensuring that any
**interception**]{.mark} attempt [is **immediately flagged**,
enabling]{.mark} military leaders to take **[corrective
action]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[23\]. Furthermore, intelligence agencies
tasked with safeguarding national security and conducting covert
operations rely heavily on the secure transmission of highly sensitive
data. Quantum sensors significantly bolster the security of these
communications, ensuring that encrypted data passed between intelligence
offices, field operatives, and global counterparts remains safe from
interception. In the event that hostile actors attempt to infiltrate
communication channels, quantum sensors enable real-time detection,
ensuring that compromised encryption keys are discarded before any data
is transmitted. This guarantees that classified information remains
protected, even in the face of evolving cyber threats \[28\]. [[The
impact]{.mark} of quantum sensors [extends]{.mark} **[beyond]{.mark}**
just [security; they also improve]{.mark} the [**performance** of
global]{.mark} military and intelligence communication
[networks]{.mark}]{.underline}. By enabling lower noise levels and
greater data integrity in fiber-optic communication, [[**quantum
sensors** ensure that data]{.mark} transmitted over long distances often
between continents [arrives with **minimal errors**]{.mark} and
degradation]{.underline}. This is crucial for global intelligence
networks, where high-fidelity, real-time communication is essential for
coordinating international counterterrorism efforts, managing
intelligence-sharing alliances, and conducting high-level diplomatic
communications. The integration of quantum sensors ensures that this
data arrives securely and intact, even when transmitted across vast
geographic distances. Moreover, [[**quantum sensors** facilitate
**secure satellite communication**]{.mark}, a key component [of]{.mark}
global **[military]{.mark}** operations [and **intelligence**
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quantum communication satellites
equipped with quantum sensors can transmit encrypted data to ground
stations and other satellites, ensuring secure global communication in
real time. This capability is especially relevant for military forces
conducting operations in remote or hostile regions where ground-based
communication infrastructure is limited or compromised. By leveraging
quantum satellites, military and intelligence agencies can establish
secure communication links that are resistant to jamming, interception,
and cyberattacks \[26\].

Introduction

[[**China** is]{.mark} actively **[pursuing]{.mark}** advancements
in **[quantum]{.mark}**]{.underline} information science (QIS), [which
**[harnesses]{.mark}** the principles of quantum [**mechanics**

fundamentally [new ways]{.underline}, and some of [these advancements
[**outstrip** the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates in **scale**
and **scope**, [making]{.mark} U.S. [leadership]{.mark} in quantum [far
from **assured**]{.mark}. Quantum [technologies]{.mark} not only [are
important for **national security**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but they also
have the potential to exert a transformative influence on the economy
and society. [[Being at the forefront]{.mark} of this **technological
frontier** is [strategically **crucial**]{.mark} for the United States
in terms of both its **economic** and societal
**well-being**]{.underline}.

Overall, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** dominates in quantum
communications, lags behind in quantum computing, and [roughly
[**matches** the United]{.mark} States [in **quantum
sensing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. State-funded labs, elite universities
such as University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and a
select group of private companies are advancing technologies that align
closely with national priorities. In quantum communications, China has
secured global leadership, notably demonstrated through the development
of the world's longest quantum key distribution (QKD) network---the
1,200-mile Beijing-Shanghai backbone. Coupled with the groundbreaking
Micius satellite, which extends quantum communication over even greater
distances, this network has put China at the forefront of secure,
long-distance quantum communication. However, in quantum computing,
China lags behind significantly, particularly in hardware and the
practical implementation of quantum systems. [In quantum sensing, China
[**leads** in certain aspects]{.mark} and the **U**nited **S**tates in
others. This contrast---[China's]{.mark} [**leadership** in]{.mark} the
more market-ready **[quantum sensing]{.mark}** versus its lag in the
less-mature quantum computing---[illustrates its strength in **swiftly
refining**]{.mark} and applying existing
**[research]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as its limitations in
foundational innovation.

[[China is]{.mark} fully [**aware of** its **strengths**]{.mark} and
plays to them]{.underline}. At the core of its quantum innovation
strategy is a relentless focus on translating cutting-edge research into
practical, commercial applications. Government initiatives have created
specialized hubs such as Hefei's Quantum Avenue, where academic research
is seamlessly converted into market-ready technologies. China's approach
is notably insular, with limited international collaboration in research
publications. While this strategy has yielded rapid gains, especially in
quantum communications, it also presents long-term risks. [[The
**immense cost** and **complexity**]{.mark} of quantum technology
development, as well as its globally **dispersed supply chain**,
[requires]{.mark} **international
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}---something that China's
inward-looking approach may struggle to sustain[. [China benefits
significantly]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the **[open]{.mark} [innovation
environments]{.mark}** of other nations, yet it is notably
protective]{.underline} of its own advances. While it leverages global
research, China restricts the sharing of its developments, reflecting a
strategic approach to maintaining a competitive edge.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should take **immediate** and
**decisive action** to **ensure** its **leadership**]{.mark} in quantum
technology]{.underline}. This includes significantly increasing funding
for R&D, particularly through the reauthorization of the National
Quantum Initiative (NQI). Congress should support industry-led
innovations that address critical public sector challenges, accelerating
the commercialization of quantum technologies. Additionally, the United
States should avoid imposing rigid quantum standards prematurely,
allowing the industry to innovate and evolve naturally. Careful,
targeted export controls are necessary to protect U.S. advancements
while maintaining the flow of ideas and talent essential for progress.
[[By **balancing strategic investment**]{.mark}, [**innovation**,
and]{.mark} **[security]{.mark}**, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[can ensure it remains at the **forefront** of **global
quantum**]{.mark} **technology**]{.underline}.

[China]{.underline} has [revealed]{.underline} a [breakthrough

**underwater communications** lines across the world]{.underline}.

The tool is said to be able to operate as deep as four kilometres below

[The device]{.underline} [has been designed]{.underline} specifically
[to integrate with China\'s high-tech]{.underline} crewed and uncrewed
**[submersible vehicles]{.underline}**, according to the South China
Morning post - but its unveiling marks an uneasy breakthrough in the
eyes of the West.

The news marks the first time that any country has officially confirmed
its ability to snip underwater cables - 870,000 miles of which exist
around the world - and follows a series of China-linked sabotages in
European waters.

[In November 2024]{.underline}, a [Chinese ship]{.underline} allegedly
\"[under]{.underline} [orders from **Russia**]{.underline}\" was said to
have [sabotaged]{.underline} a pair of [critical internet cables in the
**Baltic** Sea.]{.underline}

That ship, identified by Denmark as the Yi Peng 3, severed the cables
when it dragged its anchor along the seabed for over 100 miles.

Then in January this year, another Chinese vessel was accused of
damaging an undersea telecommunications cable off the coast of Taiwan.

Taiwanese defence expert Ho Cheng-hui noted after that incident that
China has an extensive history of using various maritime tactics to
sabotage Taiwanese infrastructure.

Ho also warned the [cable damage]{.underline} [may have been a Chinese

#### Canada can't create sustainable fiber optic cables

[While [fibre optic]{.mark} technologies have tremendous operational
capacity, the main [limitation]{.mark} in its deployment [is]{.mark} the
[**cost** and **logistics**]{.mark} of deploying fibre optic
cable.]{.underline} Over the past five years, the cost of deploying
fibre optic cable has come down, in addition to the purchasing price of
the fibre optic cable itself. [The [cost of]{.mark} deploying fibre
optic [cable in the US]{.mark}A [was up to **70K USD** per 2
kilometer]{.mark} in 2018, depending on the location; five years before
(2013), this was closer to **100K USD** (Saunders, 2018). One of the
major hurdles to fibre optic connectivity in Canada is infrastructure
provisioning. There is **not enough fibre** deployed across Canada to
bridge the digital divide and enable smart utilities.]{.underline} The
availability of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) internet services in Canada
increased from 35.1% to 44.0% year over year from 2018 to 2019, mainly
in large urban areas (CRTC, 2019). It is critical to bring awareness and
identify different solutions to improve network reliability, wireless
connectivity, and corporate management. This research attempts to
highlight the pain points in the adoption of advanced trenchless
techniques available for expansion of fibre optic networks --- each of
which has its own benefits and drawbacks. The most common installation
techniques include trenched installations (i.e., open cut) and
installation using trenchless methods such as horizontal directional
drilling (HDD). It is important to gain an understanding of the
condition of fibre optic industry in the context of multiple stakeholder
expectations, right-of-way (ROW) regulations and available installation
codes or guidelines.

Previous studies have been conducted to address the digital divide that
many remote and rural indigenous communities across Canada experience
against the backdrop of policy, regulatory, and competitive challenges
that both small and large internet service providers (ISPs) face in
providing services ( McNally et al, 2018), however the challenges
related to the deployment of fibre optic cable have generally not been
discussed. [Fibre optic network, [**transmission** and
**deployment**]{.mark} in Canada [involves]{.mark} multiple challenges
--- such as [**installation difficulties**, finding]{.mark} the [initial
**capital for installation**]{.mark}, and (most importantly) a
regulatory policy that governs the deployment of optical cable using
micro trenching as a deployment method. The mandate of 50 Mbps upload/10
Mbps download internet is available to 87% of Canadians.]{.underline}
However, only 37.2% of rural communities and 27.7% of First Nations
reserve areas have access to the faster speeds of 50/10 Mbps,
demonstrating a divide between the various communities for faster
broadband services. Fibre deployment continued in 2019 across urban
Canada, with the availability of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) increasing
from 44.0% to 44.7% (2018 to 2019) of households. These deployments were
mainly in large urban areas. [While fibre optic technologies have
tremendous operational capacity, the main limitation in its deployment
is the cost and logistics.]{.underline}

[The **[majority of sea cables are]{.mark} not state-owned or
operated**]{.underline}, but [instead **[controlled by private]{.mark}
telecommunications [firms]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [There
is]{.underline},]{.mark} therefore, [[a **grey area**]{.mark} when it
comes [to **enforcing security**]{.mark} **of the system**]{.underline}.

[[If a cable is **not registered to a nation**]{.mark} in its
entirety]{.underline}, **[[how can it be sufficiently defended
from]{.mark} threats such as [hacking]{.mark}, tapping, [or]{.mark} even
[sabotage]{.mark}]{.underline}**? In 1982 [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}ations

[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f the [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea
[[attempted]{.mark} to allocate [legal protection]{.mark} to sea cables.
Of course, [nations yet to ratify]{.mark} the agreement]{.underline},
including the US, are not bound by such provisions. The best practice
for deterring interference, and ultimately protecting the nexus of
global sea cables, has proved to be somewhat elusive. Australia is
leading the way with the development of Cable Protection Zones (CPZs),
but establishing and monitoring wider CPZs in the global high seas would
be a far harder task.

[[Russia's]{.mark} new]{.underline} Yantar-[class [submarine has]{.mark}
specific [capabilities to disrupt]{.mark} cable
[signals]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2017 a tabletop exercise was conducted
by the Center for a New American Security on sea cable security. This
wargame of sorts simulated a Russian attack on NATO sea lines of
communication, specifically sea cables off the coast of Iceland.
Participants struggled to determine whose responsibility is was to
restore the cables -- the grey zone between state and private ownership
of sea cables was a significant hurdle for policy-makers.

[[At present]{.underline}]{.mark}, the trans-Arctic **[[cable
involves]{.mark} a consortium of [state-owned
firms]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [This **points to a further potential
challenge**]{.underline}]{.mark}[: the security of data
transmission]{.underline}. Finland's state-owned Cinia Group Oy and
China's state-owned China Telecom are central backers of a trans-Arctic
sea cable. Investigating Russian stakeholders in a trans-Arctic cable is
where things get a little murky, primarily because this cable route is
not new at all. Links to the Kremlin are evident.

[blue waterways capable of supporting deep-draft commercial and military

on]{.underline} the [Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, Atlantic,

failure to prepare for]{.mark} and adapt to the significant
diplomatic**, economic, cultural, and military [**transformations**
**already in the making.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

As the Arctic's melting ice opens new shipping routes, thaws previously
ice-protected shores, and unlocks access to untapped resources, the far
north takes on new strategic importance. Indeed, the Bering
Strait---expected to become the Arctic's Gibraltar---is already a
chokepoint for global shipping and military operations. Furthermore,
[**[Russia's militarization of]{.mark} Arctic [territories and China's
growing]{.mark} Arctic [ambitions]{.mark}** [**demand**]{.mark} our
urgent **[attention]{.mark}**. In order to safeguard our national
interests and promote global stability, **[the U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates **[must]{.mark}** ignore the red herring of climate
debates and instead **[accept the reality of ice melt]{.mark}** by
honing a comprehensive and aggressive Arctic strategy. We have not a
moment to waste: already lagging years behind our competitors in this
arena, such a combined effort among US military, federal, and private
entities will require decades of planning.]{.underline}

Climate Change and Warfare: An Environmental History

While Earth's climate is changing at a faster pace than ever before,
climatic episodes over the past two thousand years---like the Roman
Climate Optimum (200 BCE--150 CE), the Little Antique Ice Age (300
CE--700 CE), the Medieval warming period (950 CE--1250), and the Little
Ice Age (1350--1850)---offer important perspective. In this era of
human-influenced climate change, these periods tell us that climate
change does not always spell disaster. Indeed, studies of these periods
tell us that climate influences the conduct or outcome of war rather
than determining it. Our modern era of climate change can certainly
exacerbate vulnerabilities for those militaries who ignore it; but for
those who most capture the winds of history into the sails of their
respective war machines, it can provide strategic opportunities.

Climate can influence who you fight, what you fight over, when you fight
and where, and perhaps most importantly, why you fight. Changing Arctic
conditions demand strategists consider those five W's in a
twenty-first-century context. Before 2050, the United States, Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland must assess how the diminishing
North Pole ice wall will transform into blue borders accessible not only
to trade, but also to other strategic competitors, like Russia and
China. The importance of such considerations could hardly be overstated:
Arctic flashpoints include vast mineral resources, largely untapped oil
and gas reserves, and disputes over sovereignty within exclusive
economic zones and resultant trade wars. In the past, such
considerations have only been necessary in the summer months (except for
submarine and long-range air assets), when climate conditions were most
hospitable to both land and sea forces. Yet melting ice is projected to
allow for year-round naval and commercial shipping competition as early
as 2050---with sea trade via the region expected to double by 2035.
Compared to the Panama and Suez Canals, the Northern Sea Route offers
significantly reduced transit times---and with it, fuel costs---thus
rendering it perhaps the most lucrative alternative to traditional
shipping lanes.

But why reallocate resources from our present strategic footprint?
Simply put, the Arctic is quickly evolving into the new dance floor for
geopolitical competition (including, in its most extreme manifestation,
warfare), replete with all the classic Thucydidean trappings of fear,
honor, and interest. This is not an exaggeration: Russia and China have
already signaled their desire for Arctic dominance. With the world's
largest icebreaker fleet, Russia poses the most dominant and formidable
force in the region. Russia has seized the strategic and operational
advantage, maintaining near-continuous operations in the Arctic,
sharpening firsthand experience in the seascape, and challenging any
foreign militaries who dare transit these frigid waters. Not far behind
Russia, China---the self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state"---has similarly
declared itself a regional force. China has invested heavily in its
Polar Silk Road, thus expanding its maritime and global spheres of
influence and all but guaranteeing strategic and economic returns in the
region.

US Arctic Strategy

In recent years, DoD's Arctic Strategy has undergone considerable review
and revision. Indeed, current policy is drastically different from the
policies of a decade ago. These new strategic visions no doubt have
heightened our awareness of the Arctic's growing geopolitical
importance, and these policies are not without their strengths. But our
most recent strides leave one wondering: Are we doing enough? The United
States is an Arctic nation, but does our strategic policy fully reflect
this? Current US strategy acknowledges, for example, the Arctic is not
just warming---it's becoming a new arena for strategic competition. In
this light, the strategy's "monitor-and-respond" approach reads as both
too passive and too reactive for the competitive contest likely to
develop in the far north. While we recognize the innate importance of
robust monitoring and other intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities in the region, we also acknowledge that
China and Russia are already conducting combined exercises off the coast
of Alaska. Considered in this light, our monitor-and-respond strategy
resembles the military equivalent of relying on a giant Ring camera:
it's great for observation, but insufficient for deterring adversaries
and projecting power.

More alarming still, the United States lags woefully behind her fellow
great powers in Arctic preparations. By the time the United States
published its first radical transformation of Arctic strategic policy,
it was decades, even centuries, behind Russia's interest in the
region---an interest that transformed into action by the 2000s.
Likewise, China has been honing its Arctic intentions since 2013, when
it gained "observer" status in the Arctic Council. The following year,
Russia created its Arctic Joint Strategic Command, and just three years
after that, declared its plans to "phase NATO out of the Arctic." By
2018, China published its first Arctic policy white paper, and shortly
after launched its first domestically built icebreaker. In 2023, Russia
declared the Arctic its second priority---a priority Moscow is well
positioned to promote with its already robust Arctic presence and
operating bases. Two of the world's most powerful militaries have
signaled their intent to establish strategic, diplomatic, and economic
dominance of the world's smallest ocean. Can the United States really
afford to simply monitor and respond?

[**We recognize this call to action is not without significant
obstacles**.]{.underline} As our most current Arctic Strategy rightly
points out, we must "balance against other DoD global commitments"---and
[we have to determine how to do this in an environment replete with
fiscal, structural, environmental, and manpower challenges]{.underline}.
We are not suggesting that DoD abandon our global commitments in favor
of Arctic operations. [We are arguing]{.underline}, however, [that [the
**department cannot abandon Arctic power projection**]{.mark} in favor
of keeping global commitments]{.underline}. [It will be hard. **It will
stretch our forces and our capabilities**. But [it is worth
remembering]{.mark} that [Russia]{.mark} is doing both. [China is doing
both]{.mark}. And increasingly, they are doing both
together]{.underline}---including in back-to-back naval exercises in
2022 and 2023 off the coast of Alaska. [[Accordingly]{.mark}, we must do
both, and **[we must start now]{.mark}**]{.underline}[**.**
[US]{.underline}]{.mark} [Arctic strategy and [policy must
shift]{.mark}]{.underline} from a future-oriented mindset of what we
will do when time and resources allow to an ethos of what we are doing
now, lest we look back in 2030 or 2050 at what we should've, could've,
or would've done differently to prepare **[[for a blue
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.** In this light, aiming principally to
"manage risk in the region" is not an acceptable substitute for
establishing presence. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [**must take
action** now to **ensure we are prepared to**]{.mark} **successfully
[maintain peace]{.mark} and prosperity [in the]{.mark} blue
[Arctic]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[On the side of challenges, one is scale and funding continuity:
[Canadian projects]{.mark} sometimes [struggle to scale up due to
funding gaps]{.mark}]{.underline} or a limited domestic market.
[[Large-scale quantum]{.mark} computing efforts [require sustained
investment]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [Canadian
[startups]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[seek foreign
capital]{.underline}]{.mark} or customers [to grow]{.underline} (indeed,
D-Wave listed on the NYSE to raise funds, and some startups might be
acquisition targets for U.S. tech giants). [[**Brain drain** is
a]{.underline}]{.mark} related [[concern]{.underline}]{.mark} -- with
tech behemoths like Google, IBM, and Microsoft investing heavily in
quantum, [Canadian experts can be lured abroad by bigger budgets.
Retaining talent will require Canada to present attractive
opportunities]{.underline} at home, whether through government grants,
industry jobs, or entrepreneurship support. Another challenge is that
[[Canada's]{.mark} big industry has been **[slow to engage in
quantum]{.mark}**]{.underline} relative to peers. In the U.S. and
Europe, large enterprises in sectors from finance to automotive are
already running quantum pilot projects or forming consortia (for
example, JPMorgan and Volkswagen each have notable quantum teams). In
Canada, until recently, adoption was limited to niche collaborations.
Only in 2025 did a major Canadian bank -- BMO -- become the first in the
country to join the IBM Quantum Network to explore practical quantum use
cases like portfolio optimization. This indicates that Canadian industry
is beginning to take notice, but [widespread "[quantum readiness" is
not]{.mark} yet [common]{.mark} among large Canadian firms]{.underline}.
An expert panel convened by the Council of Canadian Academies in 2023
indeed found that, [while [Canada]{.mark} leads in research, it "[faces
challenges in the adoption]{.mark}]{.underline} *of these technologies
as they approach market readiness*." The panel emphasized that
[[government support]{.underline}]{.mark} to date has focused on R&D,
[[with "significantly less attention to]{.underline}]{.mark}
*stimulating* **[[technology diffusion and
adoption]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in the broader economy. This implies
[Canada will need to encourage more]{.underline} end-users (in energy,
telecom, finance, etc.) [to experiment with quantum
solutions]{.underline}, perhaps via incentives or procurement, [to avoid
lagging]{.underline} in commercialization. Finally, [[Canada]{.mark}'s
mid-sized economy]{.underline} means it [[must **choose its battles
wisely**]{.mark} in the quantum domain. [It]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
[**[cannot compete head-on]{.mark}** in every subfield]{.underline}, so
it may concentrate on areas where it has a lead (for instance, quantum

[[Canadians have a grudging commitment to]{.mark} their [national
defense.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The country spends]{.mark} well [under 2
percent]{.mark} of its [GDP]{.mark} on the military. [Its fleets are
aging, and]{.mark} much of its **[infrastructure]{.mark} is
[crumbling]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Canadian Armed Forces are
budgeted for 101,500 personnel---a modest figure compared with
allies---and they're 16,500 short. [After years of neglect, the
government]{.underline} has slowly started to refurbish the CAF, but it
[has a long way to go.]{.underline}

[[If there's one reason Canada's military is]{.mark} this [weak, it's
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. [[Sharing
a border]{.underline}]{.mark} with a benign superpower [has [given
Canada]{.mark} a source of security and [deterrence]{.mark} that [it
didn't need to]{.mark} buy or [build itself]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[That's why]{.underline} the country has designed [[its military]{.mark}
not as a self-sufficient]{.underline} force [but]{.underline} largely
[as a supplement to America's.]{.underline} [The CAF [can't
mount]{.mark}]{.underline} sustained overseas [[operations]{.mark} on
its own, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} Canada [[can]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[meaningfully [contribute to U.S.-led missions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
on a limited budget. [Domestic manufacturers can't supply]{.underline}
much of the CAF's [most important equipment, but **America's
can.**]{.underline}

[Virtually **[every aspect of Canada's military]{.mark}**---its size,
structure, budget, and strategy---[is predicated on]{.mark}]{.underline}
a series of [[assumptions about]{.mark} the]{.underline} benevolence and
[support of [America]{.mark}n leaders. These]{.underline} assumptions
[have been in place for decades]{.underline}; President Donald Trump has
overturned them in a matter of weeks. Because of his threats of economic
coercion and annexation, Canada's leaders have suddenly realized they
may not be able to rely on American might anymore. Divesting from U.S.
suppliers was once unthinkable, but Canada has already begun searching
elsewhere. To take just one example, Ottawa is reviewing its \$13
billion commitment to buy 88 F-35 fighter aircraft from Lockheed Martin
as it hunts for alternative suppliers in Europe. [[Trump]{.mark}'s
threats [might]{.mark} [compel]{.mark} the CAF to begin
[decoupling]{.mark} from America---a process [that could leave the
military]{.mark} even [weaker]{.mark}]{.underline} than it is now.

[This]{.underline} sudden conflict with the United States [fundamentally
threatens Canada's]{.underline} long-standing [approach to national
defense]{.underline}. But Canadians have responded to crises in the past
by dramatically bolstering their military on short notice. Trump may
have just prompted them to do it again.

[The race for the Arctic is heating up and [Canada is **feeling the
burn**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since 2008, when the Russian government
declared its intention to become the dominant Arctic power in the world,
[Moscow]{.underline} has moved with great alacrity toward achieving its
goal---[gaining]{.underline} significant [advantages simply
by]{.underline} dint of [having been the first to invest in
expanding]{.underline} a presence in the High North [before any other
great power]{.underline} took the threat seriously.

Only recently has Washington started waking up to the fact that the real
Russian threat to the United States lies not in Europe but in the
Arctic. Even more than the Americans, though, [the Canadians, with their
expansive border along the Arctic]{.underline} region, [realize [they're
**being boxed out of their own backyard**]{.mark}]{.underline} by the
resurgent Russian bear.

To address the glaring capabilities gap between Russia and Canada,
Ottawa has announced that they will be purchasing a dozen
air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines over the next decade to
better deter the rising Russian threat in the High North.

Under the imprimatur of "Our North, Strong and Free," the Trudeau
government is putting forward a comprehensive strategy of deterrence as
well as taking action to ensure continual access to Canada's north.

[A Bleak Situation for the Royal Canadian Navy]{.underline}

This is a necessary move by Ottawa, which has allowed for [the Royal
Canadian Navy's]{.underline} ([RCN) [submarine force to
atrophy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Currently, [the
RCN [possesses only]{.mark} [four
aging]{.mark} ]{.underline}*Victoria*-class
[[sub]{.underline}]{.mark}mersible[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Three]{.underline} of these are permanently [assigned to
the]{.underline} distant [Pacific Ocean and the fourth]{.underline} is
nominally assigned [to the Atlantic]{.underline}.

[[None]{.mark} of these]{.underline} systems [are
[comparable]{.mark}]{.underline} in size or capability [[to]{.mark} the
[growing Russian presence in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Here's the issue, though. Several [experts]{.underline} who've spoken to
me for this story on condition of anonymity [are **highly skeptical**
that the Canadians will be able to move]{.underline} this ambitious
program from paper [to reality. The procurement process for Canada's
military]{.underline}---notably for extremely complex platforms, like
submarines---[is sclerotic and the **bureaucratic hurdles are
onerous.** ]{.underline}

What's more, [the projected timeline]{.underline} for the development
and deployment of these submarines [is so far into the future that it
begs the question as to whether they'll even be useful or
not.]{.underline}

The Russians are Serious About Dominating the High North

After all, the Russians have dedicated an extreme amount of resources to
securing their position in the Arctic and expanding it. Indeed, the
Russians have deployed some of their most sophisticated warships and
submarines to their Arctic holdings, while modernizing their bases
throughout the region.

They have done this even as the Ukraine war demands increasing levels of
resources and commitment from the Russian Armed Forces. And [because
of]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline} war, [the Russian defense
industrial base is humming at a feverish pace while]{.underline} most
Western defense industrial
bases---notably[ Canada's]{.underline}---[remain]{.underline} operating
[at a turgid pace.]{.underline}

Without a reliable, modern submarine force, [[the Canadian position in
the High North will erode]{.underline}]{.mark} along with the melting
ice sheet. Ottawa will become increasingly reliant on the United States
Navy and Coast Guard to shore up its position.

cables]{.underline} would [have **spillover**]{.underline}
[effects]{.underline}, [since they form the **global information
backbone**]{.underline}. Consequently, strengthening their security is
vital from a 'whole of society' perspective. Investing in more undersea
cable routes and increasing the number of cable-laying vessels are both
necessary for the United States to improve the resilience of its
telecommunications infrastructure. [Emerging]{.underline} **[satellite
communications]{.underline}** [constellations]{.underline} **[cannot
alone solve]{.underline}** the [cable security]{.underline} problem,
[but they are]{.underline} an **[important]{.underline}** part of the

[cables and communications]{.underline} satellites [are two

"[[The primary challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} that you have [[with

Satellite Connections:

- [Environmental Sensitivity: [Satellites can be affected by **space
  weather**]{.mark}]{.underline} (solar flares), [cosmic radiation,
  [and]{.mark}]{.underline} even orbital [[debris, which can interfere
  with]{.mark} signal [transmission]{.mark}]{.underline}.

  can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be blocked]{.underline}]{.mark} or
  degraded [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} terrestrial [[weather
  conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, buildings, or trees, [[affecting the
  reliability]{.underline}]{.mark} of the connection.

- [Limited Lifespan]{.underline}: Satellites have a limited operational
  lifespan (typically 10-15 years). [[When]{.underline}]{.mark} a
  [[satellite reaches its end of life]{.underline}]{.mark} or if it
  malfunctions, [[it could lead to a **loss of
  service**]{.underline}]{.mark} until a replacement satellite is
  launched.

- [Signal Latency: [Satellite]{.mark}]{.underline}
  communication[[s]{.underline} [have **higher latency**]{.underline}
  (]{.mark}[the time it takes for]{.underline} a [data]{.underline}
  packet [to travel]{.underline} from source to destination) [[than
  submarine cables because the data has to travel to space and
  back.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[This]{.mark} latency [can impact the
  performance]{.mark}]{.underline} of certain applications, like video
  conferencing or online gaming.

- [Limited Bandwidth]{.underline}: [[Satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}
  also [[have limited bandwidth compared to]{.mark} submarine
  [cables]{.mark}.]{.underline} This means [[they can handle less
  data]{.mark} at once, [which can slow down]{.mark} speeds during peak

El Segundo, CA \--  When the United States first began launching
satellites more than half a century ago, the main threats to those
valuable systems and hardware were the natural phenomena of the space
environment. [[In today's]{.underline}]{.mark} congested and contested
[[space domain]{.underline}]{.mark}, [U.S. [interests in space are
also]{.mark}]{.underline} now [[subject to man-made threats]{.mark}.
Chief [among these are
**cyber**]{.mark}**-[attacks]{.mark}. \**]{.underline}
 \
[A cyber-attack occurs when an adversary gains access]{.underline} to a
computer system [and inserts malicious code. In the space]{.underline}
domain, [[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} like these [[can include]{.mark}
**[hacking]{.mark} on-orbit [satellites]{.mark}**[; infiltrating]{.mark}
the ground]{.underline}-system [[computers that
control]{.underline}]{.mark} and receive [[data]{.mark} from the
satellites]{.underline}; compromising drones; or affecting other
computer systems, [which]{.underline} in turn [can compromise
everything]{.underline} from satellites to power grids and other
infrastructure. \
 \
"One of [the primary goal]{.underline}s [of a cyber-attack
is]{.underline} for [reconnaissance]{.underline}, whether that's for
cyber reconnaissance, [to]{.underline} further map the system and
networks with the goal of [maximiz]{.underline}ing [attack
effects]{.underline} on the system [or]{.underline} just to
[exfiltrate]{.underline} mission data [for intelligence
purposes]{.underline}," said Brian Sessler, chief of Space Systems
Command's (SSC) S6 cyber security division. \
 \
In terms of destruction, most cyberattacks are not causing the computer
system to explode or erupt into flames, Sessler said. It's more of a
functional kill - [impacting]{.underline} the [availability of the
system]{.underline} [or]{.underline} the [servers and]{.underline}
denying warfighters [access to the crucial services]{.underline} it
provides [such as]{.underline}
[comm]{.underline}unication[s]{.underline} [or]{.underline} indications
and warning [data from a satellite]{.underline}. \
 \
"Our [[space systems are **force multipliers**]{.underline}]{.mark}:
there are second- and third-order effects [if you take out]{.underline}
one of our GPS [satellites]{.underline}, for example," Sessler said.
"[How many]{.underline} other [[weapons]{.underline} [systems rely on
precision navigation]{.underline}]{.mark} and timing data and services
[[from that satellite]{.mark}]{.underline} constellation? The same can
be said for our communications and sensor satellites that are providing
critical indications and warning data. Our [adversaries are
going]{.underline} to want [to affect their availability]{.underline},
which is going to affect the kill chain and our ability to execute the
mission." \
 \
But it's not just protecting systems once they're operational, Sessler
explained. Cyberattack threats apply across all phases of the
acquisition process and need to be addressed early. A lot of it comes
down to making sure all personnel are trained and able to recognize
phishing attempts, social engineering, and insider threats that could
compromise a system early in the design and development process. \
 \
While the areas of vulnerability for a satellite might be different than
for a terrestrial system, much of the protective measures are similar: a
layered defense, monitoring for unusual traffic, encryption, and making
sure only certain users are allowed to issue commands under various
conditions. \
 \
"[[Cybersecurity]{.mark} [is]{.mark} very [tough]{.mark} because [the
adversary **only needs a pin hole**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the attack
surface," Sessler said. "We'[re defending against the entire surface,
all potential attack vectors,]{.underline} and the adversary only needs
to find that one pin hole. Cybersecurity starts early in the life cycle,
but at every step of the acquisition process, we need to stay
vigilant." 

### Optical Comms CP\-\--Cyberattacks\-\--2AC

#### Optical sensors are [highly vulnerable]{.underline} to cyberattacks. The bar for [significant disruption]{.underline} is low.

\"Lasers -- A Dual Use System Left Vulnerable To Cyber-Attack --

22 June 2024//ILake-AW

Unfortunately, [lasers aren't only]{.underline} [used for harmless
purposes]{.underline}. As acknowledged by the article's author,
[lasers]{.underline}, as a dual-use technology, [can]{.underline} be
utilized to [**dazzle** optical sensors]{.underline}, effectively
[blocking]{.underline} the [capture of images]{.underline} in targeted
areas. By increasing the laser's power, permanent damage to the optical
sensor's focal plane can be achieved, ending the sensor's ability to
perform its role. These types of ground-based technologies could play a
significant role in strategic conflicts by affecting countries'
abilities to perform reconnaissance.

Though not the focus of the article, the topic of cybersecurity is
briefly mentioned in the context of securing satellite communications
from attacks and degradation. However, [missing from the conversation is
the role of **cybersecurity** in the laser systems
themselves]{.underline}. Just like any other computer, [the
systems]{.underline} controlling lasers [are **vulnerable** to
**cyber-attacks** that]{.underline} can [degrade]{.underline} [the
lasers' ability to perform their role or **take over their
operations**.]{.underline}

Continuous laser ranging on satellites and debris creates a safer
operating environment and provides a strategic advantage in conflicts.
However, [if a cyber-attack leaves]{.underline} [you **unable to
access**]{.underline} that [data while giving **millimeter-accuracy
orbit** determination]{.underline} to your adversary, [**billions** of
dollars' worth of **difficult to replace satellite** systems can be held
at risk]{.underline} [to]{.underline} their [weapons
systems]{.underline}. Similarly, [high-powered lasers used to **alter
space debris** courses can be]{.underline} quickly [turned into a
**dispersed** attack]{.underline} [network]{.underline} by nation-states
or other nefarious actors. High-powered [laser systems]{.underline} with
access to ultra-precise ephemeris data [can be directed at **optical
sensors**]{.underline}, permanently disabling them or [**wreaking
havoc** on]{.underline} [imagery]{.underline} analysts' work. With a
sophisticated enough cyber-attack, [this could be done
**without**]{.underline} the attacker needing [the infrastructure and
technology required to build a high-powered laser]{.underline}, [simply
create a **dispersed laser attack**]{.underline} system [by borrowing
someone else's **unsecured network**]{.underline} to gain an upper hand
in reconnaissance.

[Satellites are **vulnerable**]{.underline} in their own right however.
Recent [news about Russia]{.underline} [possibly]{.underline} [placing
**nuclear weapons** in orbit illustrates]{.underline} that [satellites
could be **destroyed**]{.underline} or disabled [in orbit]{.underline}.
With this situation quite opposite, [**terrestrial networks**
would]{.underline} indeed [be needed to take up the slack]{.underline}.
[**ViaSat** at]{.underline} the [beginning of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} [suffered a cyber-attack]{.underline}, likely by
Russian hackers, which disabled wind turbines in Germany. Although this
attack disabled modems rather than satellites themselves,
[**vulnerability** of Space assets was highlighted.]{.underline}

This is not the first time satellites have been called into action
because of compromised terrestrial networks. As SpaceNews illustrates,
the 2022 volcanic eruption in Tonga damaged subsea cables. Intelsat and
SES were called in and restored service. Ukraine has been using SpaceX's
Starlink for communications since the beginning of the war.

Moving forward [it appears]{.underline} that [both
Space-based]{.underline} [and terrestrial communication systems will
become **targets**]{.underline} for various actors. Although severing a
cable might be easier than disabling a satellite for certain aggressors,
it might be wise for those on the receiving end to be aware of their
weaknesses regarding communications; both civil and military. The
international community must hold nefarious actors accountable for
deliberate disruptions because, if we do not, the world will suffer due
to its reliance on global telecommunications.

\"Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that [we assess is

spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder on Tuesday evening.

[It was on the \"**same orbit**]{.underline}\" [as a US government

Russia has not publicly commented on the issue.

[Moscow and Washington]{.underline} - two global rivals - have

issue at the UN in recent weeks, with both sides accusing each other of
seeking to militarise space.

Zakharova claimed the US was seeking to turn space into an \"arena for
military confrontation\".

A number of military experts have long warned that space is likely to be
the next frontier of warfare in an increasingly technology-dependent

because it was tapped [for]{.underline} [**military use** in
Ukraine]{.underline} [following Russia\'s invasion]{.underline} of the
nation in 2022, according to a new report evaluating the counterspace
capabilities of a dozen countries over the past year.

The report, published on April 3 by the nonpartisan policy think tank
Secure World Foundation (SWF), highlights how [humanity\'s growing
**reliance** on space]{.underline} --- especially for national security
--- has [led an increasing number of countries to]{.underline}
[develop]{.underline} their own [**counterspace**
capabilities]{.underline}. The 316-page document assesses the
counterspace capabilities of 12 countries including the U.S., Russia,
China, India, Australia as well as North Korea and South Korea, based on
publicly available information spanning February 2024 through February
of this year.

\"We feel strongly that a more open and public debate on these issues is
urgently needed,\" the report\'s foreword states. \"Our global society
and economy are increasingly dependent on space capabilities, and a
future [conflict in space]{.underline} [could have massive]{.underline},
long-term negative **[repercussions]{.underline}** that are felt here on
Earth, as **[everyone]{.underline}** on this planet [is a user of
**space data** in some form]{.underline}.\"

SpaceX\'s Starlink uses a massive network of satellites in low Earth
orbit to provide high-speed broadband internet. [Ukrainian
residents]{.underline} [began using Starlink]{.underline} [in 2022 to
maintain internet connectivity after Ukraine\'s own internet services
were disrupted]{.underline} following Russia\'s invasion. [The service
also enabled **secure communications** for the Ukrainian
military]{.underline} and government. Starting [in]{.underline} May
[2024]{.underline}, however, [the Ukrainian military began
**experiencing outages**]{.underline} in Starlink connections, with
military officials attributing the disruptions to Russia \"testing
different mechanisms\" for its electronic warfare systems seemingly
employing new and more advanced technology.

The SWF report cites [leaked U.S. military documents]{.underline} that
[suggest a Russian system called **Tobol**]{.underline} --- that was
originally designed to protect Russian satellites from jamming --- [was
used to disrupt Starlink]{.underline} commercial satellite signals over
Ukrainian territory. Those leaked documents \"suggest that Russia has
used at least three Tobol installations to try and disrupt Starlink
commercial satellite signals over Eastern Ukraine,\" the report notes.

[aimed at **obliterating** Ukraine's]{.underline} [internet]{.underline}
infrastructure, [Elon Musk began rushing]{.underline} tens of thousands
of SpaceX [Starlink transceivers]{.underline} into the country - to
hospitals, campuses and bomb shelters - while activating his
mega-constellation of broadband-beaming satellites overhead.

Foiling Moscow's attempts to barricade Ukraine inside a bullet-backed
Iron Curtain infuriated the Kremlin leadership, and President Vladimir
V. [Putin]{.underline} [began dispatching]{.underline} his [lieutenants
to warn of **potential counterstrikes** against]{.underline} these
Western [space auxiliaries]{.underline}.

Konstantin Vorontsov, a deputy director at the Russian foreign ministry,
warned that [even these civilian spacecraft could be targeted by Russian
defense forces]{.underline} in a series of fiery speeches at UN
gatherings in Geneva and New York.

Around the same time, Elon Musk told his handpicked biographer that
Russia's ambassador to the U.S. had personally told him the use of
Starlink technology by Ukraine's resistance fighters could impel Moscow
to respond with tactical nuclear weapons. While SpaceX's founder engaged
in frenetic behind-the-scenes diplomacy to prevent any nuclear clash,
[his satellites were still marked with **Russian
bullseyes**]{.underline}, and the head of the Russian space agency
Roscosmos even threatened Musk himself for aiding Ukraine's "fascist
forces".

#### Infrastructure PPPs [fail]{.underline}

It is astonishing to read Sadek Wahba ("America needs an infrastructure
revolution", Opinion, December 20) repeat the bankrupt notion that
public-private partnerships can revitalise US infrastructure. [[PPPs are
a **failed experiment**]{.mark} in both developed and developing
countries.]{.underline}

In the US, from 1985-2016, they delivered just 498 projects, worth
\$116.5bn combined. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates
that the US needs \$2.9tn in spending over 10 years merely to improve US
infrastructure from its current grade of "C-minus" to "B".

[Globally, PPPs [account for]{.mark} just [**5 per cent** of
infrastructure provision]{.mark}. The reason is clear: private firms
[will only invest]{.mark} in infrastructure [when]{.mark} host [states
shoulder]{.mark} the lion's share of [**risk**, and
**guarantee**]{.mark} **their [revenues]{.mark}** regardless of market
conditions. [This]{.mark} in effect [**limits** PPPs to **energy**,
**telecommunications** and **toll roads**]{.mark} in a small number of
states able and willing to subsidise private profit.]{.underline} The US
does indeed need an infrastructure revolution. **[[The private sector
will absolutely not deliver it.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Cultural Differences and Misalignment of Goals

[One of the greatest challenges in implementing multinational subsea
cable projects is navigating [**cultural differences** and **misaligned
priorities** among]{.mark} stakeholders from different countries. These
projects often involve a mix of [public and private entities]{.mark},
each [with]{.mark} distinct [**business strategies**, **regulatory
frameworks**, and **geopolitical
interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The United States and China have increasingly engaged in a struggle over
subsea infrastructure, with cybersecurity and espionage concerns driving
restrictions on Chinese involvement in cable projects. This tension has
forced European policymakers to reassess their own strategies, leading
to growing caution about working with certain vendors. However, Europe
also faces internal conflicts, particularly in the wake of the dominance
of the U.S. cloud. The rise of these hyperscalers has sparked debates
over market control and European telecom firms' ability to compete.

[Historical and geopolitical tensions further complicate cooperation.
[Trans-Arctic cable projects]{.mark}, which could have provided
alternative routes to ease congestion in the global network, [have
repeatedly **failed due to geopolitical instability**, **regulatory
challenges**, and a **lack of aligned interests**]{.mark}. Projects such
as the [Russian]{.mark} Optical Trans-Arctic Submarine [Cable
System]{.mark} (ROTACS) [and Arctic Connect collapsed as partners
withdrew]{.mark}, often [for political reasons]{.mark}. Russia's own
[Polar Express]{.mark} project was [also sidelined by **geopolitical
isolation**]{.mark} following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}
