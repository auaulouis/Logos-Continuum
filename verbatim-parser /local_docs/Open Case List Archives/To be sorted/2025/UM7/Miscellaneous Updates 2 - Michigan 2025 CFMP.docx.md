#### Neoliberalism cannot be separated from capitalism -- regulated capitalism is doomed to fail.

**Foster 19** \[John Bellamy; 2-1-2019; American professor of sociology
at the University of Oregon and editor of the Monthly Review; Monthly
Review, "Capitalism Has Failed: What Next?",

Hobsbawm's position was roundly criticized at the time, even by many on
the left, as overly ―pessimistic‖ with regard to the course of
capitalist development.87 Today, however, a quarter-century later, it is
clear that he hit the mark, as the concerns that he voiced then are even
more evident today. Nevertheless, such realism in approaching the
failure of capitalism in our time is still rare on the part of left
intellectuals in the wealthy countries, even in the face of decades of
neoliberal assault combined with economic stagnation, financialization,
growing inequality, and environmental decline. One common response is to
refer to Polanyi's notion of a double movement, in which the recurring
myth of a self-regulating market society inevitably gives rise to
defensive movements to protect society and the environment.88 This has
fed the **[[hope]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the **[[pendulum will
swing]{.underline}]{.mark}** back **[again]{.underline}**,
**[[leading]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a more]{.underline}**
**[affirmative-style liberalism or social democracy]{.underline}**. This
sustains the **[belief]{.underline}** that the **[failures of
unregulated capitalism]{.underline}** can be **[countered by [a return
to regulated capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a new Keynesian age---as
if history had stood still.

Pinning hopes on a double movement of this kind, however,
**[[denies]{.underline}]{.mark}** four **[material
[realitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. **[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[social democracy [came]{.mark}]{.underline} about and persisted [[only
as long as]{.mark} the [threat of]{.mark}]{.underline} actually
[[existing socialist societies was present]{.mark} [and union
strength]{.mark} [endured]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[[faded]{.underline}]{.mark} immediately [[with]{.mark} the [demise of
both]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[neoliberalism]{.mark} today is [ingrained in capitalism]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**, in the phase of monopoly-financial capital. [[The
earlier age]{.underline}]{.mark} of industrial-capital dominance, on
which Keynesian economics was based, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[gone]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark}**, social
democracy **[was]{.underline}** in practice **[[reliant on]{.mark} an
[imperialist system]{.mark}]{.underline}** that was opposed to the
interests of the vast majority of humankind. **[Fourth]{.underline}**,
the liberal democratic state and [[the dominance of]{.mark} a
purportedly [enlightened]{.mark} industrial capitalist [class]{.mark}
[willing to engage]{.mark} in a social accord with labor [is]{.mark}
largely [a relic]{.mark} of the past]{.underline}, with its structural
bases having all but disappeared.

[Even when]{.underline} social democratic parties come to power in these
circumstances, promising to work within the system and [create a kinder
and gentler capitalism]{.underline}, **[they]{.underline}** invariably
**[fall prey to the laws of motion of capitalism in this
phase]{.underline}**. As Michael Yates writes, in the context of a
failed capitalism: ―Today, it is impossible to believe that there will
be a recovery of even the modest political and economic project that
labor unions and political parties once embraced and helped bring to
fruition.‖89

### 2NC/1NR---Collapsology

#### Liberal Internationalism reentrenches capitalism

Stephen **Pampinella** 1-23-20**19**, Assistant Professor of Political
Science and International Relations at the State University of New York

Strategy\", Disorder Of Things,

Why Liberal Internationalism Will Fail (Again)

But in recent weeks, mainstream US foreign policy experts have provided
their own spin in progressive internationalism. Advocates and
practitioners of a traditional hegemonic foreign policy have sought to
co-opt progressive internationalism in a series of essays which argue
for the necessity of American power and global influence. These writers
embody the post-Cold War centrist foreign policy coalition of liberal
internationalists and neoconservatives. For them, that the greatest
threat to the democratic "free" world created by the United States
remains the autocratic governance model of Russia and China. While
Washington should pursue cooperation on transnational governance issues
where possible, they argue it cannot do so at the expense of making
security concessions which would reward revisionist behavior by great
power rivals. As in the past, American exceptionalism remains the
identity narrative justifying a return to US hegemony, with
Anglo-American norms serving as the basis for hegemonic socialization
and cooperation.

The internationalist disposition is a reminder of why a mere social
democratic twist on US hegemony will fail to provide actual security for
the United States and its allies. Establishment voices continue to rely
on state-centric assumptions about IR and ignore how state identities
and interests are a function of their relationship with each other. Or,
as Jennifer Mitzen and Michelle Murray might argue, the revisionist
intentions of Russia and China are a product of their ontological
insecurity. A hegemonic United States defending an Anglo-American order
denies them recognition of their own great power identities and their
right to participate in all deliberations about global order. From this
perspective, we should challenge the implicit assumption made by Anthony
Blinken and Robert Kagan that Russia is revisionist by nature. An
[internationalist perspective suggests that Russia has adopted those
intentions in relation to a Wilsonian United States which seeks
domination over Moscow and the transformation of its political system.
The same is true for China, which rejects being cast as a "responsible
stakeholder" by Washington which would eventually accept democracy
following its internal transformation by global capitalism. In other
words, the very terms of US relations with these states over the past 25
years is the source of their revisionist intentions, and not some
essentialized feature of their domestic politics.]{.underline}

[Further, a liberal exceptionalist narrative that contrasts "Eastern
autocracy" with "Western freedom" masks how the United States has
perpetuated its own systems of illiberal dominance throughout its
history.]{.underline} Those same structures of oppression are the
greatest threat to contemporary US democracy and also serve as glaring
evidence of US hypocrisy. In his defense of American exceptionalism,
Jake Sullivan represents institutional racism as a bug rather than a
feature of the American political system by emphasizing the liberal
ideals of the Founders and casting Donald Trump's white ethnonationalism
as an aberration. But this telling of the American story whitewashes the
long history of an exclusive, white ethnic US identity dating back to
the early 19th Century and its role in generating the modern United
States. Scholars of American political development and US history have
long demonstrated that institutions of slavery and land conquest
constituted US society and made possible its economic prosperity rather
than some kind of intrinsic tendency toward freedom.

[Fast-forward to the present: liberal exceptionalism further denies how
economic globalization made possible the rise of authoritarianism. Nils
Gilman and David Klion rightly argue that the kleptocratic alliance
between autocrats and oligarchs is the true threat to democracy and rule
of law. Their ability to concentrate political and economic power has
been enabled by the emergence of an integrated global market that
privileges the freedom of capital over the needs of ordinary people, one
created by the United States when liberal internationalism went global
after the fall of the Soviet Union.]{.underline}

Finally, attempts to revive US hegemony will doom transnational efforts
to deal with existential non-state threats. Hegemonists like Thomas
Wright argue that Russia and China are the greatest threat to the United
States, and that Washington should never make concessions to either
power as a means of ensuring cooperation on issues of global governance.
However, "ring-fencing" global capitalism and climate change as separate
issues will fail to achieve the necessary level of cooperation to cope
with these threats. National security policymakers cannot recognize that
the greatest dangers faced by US citizens are non-state economic and
ecological global processes that shape domestic politics from the
inside-out, and not rival sovereigns. Economic destitution to the point
of embracing fascist dictators coupled with environmental collapse are
near-certain non-state threats which transcend our boundaries -- in
fact, as a global power, the United States has been complicit in
creating them.

[The internationalist disposition would suggest that the priorities of
US foreign policy must change. Regulating global processes should be the
primary objective, and it requires that the United States pursue intense
macro-levels of cooperation with all other states,
including]{.underline} its rivals, to achieve them. Yet it will be
unlikely to do so if it remains wedded to liberal hegemony and consumed
by great power competition. Short-term incentives to accumulate
resources and power will override the long-term need for global
governance. The result will be a world whose people live in precarity,
ravaged by climate change, and constantly on the verge of great power
war.

#### Governance Standards Reinforce racialized hiearchy

**[Good governance]{.underline}**. **[The program of good
governance]{.underline}** **[and its]{.underline}** strategic
**[promotion in the non-European world illustrates this
point]{.underline}**. A term that gained considerable prominence in the
field during the 1990s, **[good governance became a way of
organizing]{.underline}**, interpreting, **[and deploying legal
doctrines in international politics]{.underline}**. While norms
entrepreneurs in various international and nongovernmental organizations
herald the concept as an advance in international law, critics note that
**[it bears an old lineage of racialized dispossession]{.underline}**.
**[Influential development institutions]{.underline}** such as the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, **[as well as human rights
groups]{.underline}**, **[promote standards of governance]{.underline}**
that are **[seen as already perfected in the European
world]{.underline}**. On the other hand, **[non-White-majority societies
are imagined in perpetual lack of the good governance needed for
stability and progress]{.underline}**. Countries that lack good
governance, thus, are **[understood as lacking some quality implicitly
assigned to White countries]{.underline}**. According to Anghie (2006),
good governance was invoked **[to create non-European governments that
would facilitate European commercial expansion]{.underline}**. Grovogui
(1996) similarly **[explicates international law as]{.underline}**
"**[outside administration]{.underline}**" **[by a West that seeks to
maintain its imperial holdings long after its withdrawal.]{.underline}**

Status of Forces Agreements. Extraterritoriality in US Status of Forces
Agreements (SOFAs) betrays similar assumptions about state capacity and
governance. SOFAs establish when and how the domestic laws of host
governments are applied to US military personnel stationed in those
countries (Yeo 2014, Efrat 2022). While these agreements stop short of
immunizing US troops against criminal sanctions, SOFAs effectively
constrain the legal authority host countries exercise over US forces. At
their core, SOFAs attempt to reconcile US interest in safeguarding
soldiers' rights with deeply held beliefs about the inferiority of
non-European institutions and courts (Freeman 2021). Foreign basing
contracts like SOFAs---a bargained concept of hierarchy---are not beyond
prevailing symbols of subordination that reinforce pathologies of
colonial legal regimes (Cooley 2017, Allen et al. 2020). **[The notion
that non-Europeans lack]{.underline}** "**[government suited to the
white man]{.underline}**" **[has long been embraced as]{.underline}**
"**[just cause]{.underline}**" **[for extraterritorial jurisdiction, and
in some cases, capitulation]{.underline}** (Grovogui 1996, p. 51). A
hallmark of Western foreign policy, extraterritoriality declares a kind
of state of emergency **[where normal rules do not apply]{.underline}**
(Ruskola 2008). Variation in US SOFA jurisdiction conveys a similar
story. The United States imposes concurrent jurisdiction to govern its
interactions with predominantly European host states, allowing these
peer countries to try US personnel while withholding this same right
from most non-European host partners, ceteris paribus (Freeman 2021).
Since immunity relies on the premise of inherent difference between
peoples and societies (Cassel 2011), it affirms prevailing beliefs about
racial difference. Thus, hierarchical conceptions of race are reified
through extraterritorial jurisdiction and its codification into the
SOFA.

### Strip mining

#### Even if China is the main REM exporter, they get them from [Congo]{.underline}.

**Tom '25** is the Founding Director of Action Kivu and the co-founder
and Executive Director of ABFEC (Action for the Welfare of Women and
Children in Congo), a Congolese grassroots organization for which Action
Kivu, a U.S. based nonprofit organization, raises awareness and funds to
provide the resources for ABFEC's community-based initiatives that
foster equality for conflict-affected women and children in the Eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo. (Amani Matabaro, "China\'s Illegal Mining
Operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo", *Harvard Kennedy School
Carr-Ryan Center for Human Rights,* 1-28-2025,
[[https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/carr-ryan/our-work/carr-ryan-commentary/chinas-illegal-mining-operations-democratic]{.underline}](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/carr-ryan/our-work/carr-ryan-commentary/chinas-illegal-mining-operations-democratic)
)//LFS---LMH

For the last three decades---since 1996, during the First Congo
War---[the DRC has been caught in ongoing wars mainly fueled by the
illegal mining operations of foreign and local armed groups, which
result in local communities experiencing numerous overlapping
vulnerabilities.]{.underline} Regardless of how the 21st century's
global tech industry revolution depends on sourcing raw materials from
the DRC, it is a global humiliation and shame that the world remains
silent in the face of the unparalleled lack of transparency within the
supply chain of the DRC's critical minerals, which are needed to make a
successful green energy transition possible. [The ongoing armed conflict
in the DRC has resulted in the deaths of more than 10 million people,
making it the deadliest war since World War II. ]{.underline}

[\"There are more than 450 mining companies in the South Kivu Province,
mostly run by Chinese nationals, but unfortunately, they are operating
illegally due to a lack of compliance with current Congolese mining
codes.\"]{.underline}

[Looking at what is happening on the ground in Africa right now,
especially in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, we
see China's imperialism, we see human rights and the environment both at
high risk, and we see rampant corruption and a lack of good governance.
In December 2024 and January 2025, while the M23 rebel group backed by
Rwanda has continued fighting and seizing key towns in the Eastern
Congo's North and South Kivu provinces, several Chinese nationals have
been found actively involved in illegal mining operations in the South
Kivu Province. On  December 20, 2024, a group of 17 Chinese nationals
were arrested for their direct and active involvement in illegal gold
mining operations in the Walungu and Mwenga territories of the South
Kivu Province, but surprisingly, after instructions were given from
Congolese government officials in Kinshasa, they were released with no
legal penalties or fines. ]{.underline}

Sources from the Office of the Governor of the South Kivu Province
revealed that on January 4, 2025, three Chinese nationals were arrested
holding 10 gold bars and \$400,000 in cash in eastern Democratic
Republic of Congo. These revelations were only made public and available
to local and international media by the governor himself later on. These
events show a systematic money laundering scheme that involves different
local, regional, and foreign actors within a context where basic social
services are almost non-existent for the local community, and yet there
are contracts between the Chinese and Congolese governments about
mineral exploitation in exchange for public infrastructures.

There are more than 450 mining companies in the South Kivu Province,
mostly run by Chinese nationals, but unfortunately, they are operating
illegally due to a lack of compliance with current Congolese mining
codes. It is worth noting that there is escalation of violence as a
result of the ongoing war fueled by critical minerals. Most of the
locations seized by the M23 rebel group---including Numbi, Lumbishi,
Shanje, and Minova---in the south Kivu Province are home to abundant
reserves of tourmaline, perilium, cassiterite, and gold, as well as
Rubaya in the North Kivu province, which is also home to most of the
DRC's coltan reserve.

[\"In territories with mining operations, the rate of severe
malnutrition among children under five years old is high, many children
are out of school, there is an unbearable degradation of water
ecosystems, and the rainforest is being washed out.\"]{.underline}

[According to the recent[ 2024 ranking report
by Forbes](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/top-10-powerful-countries-in-the-world/87201/1), China
was just named the second global economic power after the United States.
China has been invading the African continent across different sectors,
including real estate, road infrastructure, telecommunication, textiles,
medium and small enterprises, timber, oil, fishing, and natural
resources (focusing on minerals), despite the deployment of UN
Peacekeepers in the DRC.]{.underline}

### AT: AGI Risks

#### No evil superintelligence. 

**Shermer 17**, Dr. Michael Shermer is the Founding Publisher of Skeptic

[This brings to mind the \"hard problem\" of consciousness---if we
don\'t understand how this happens in humans, how could we **program it
into computers?**]{.underline} As Steven Pinker elucidated in his answer
to the 2015 Edge Question on what to think about machines that think,
\"[[AI dystopias]{.mark} project a **parochial alpha-male psychology**
onto the **concept of intelligence**]{.underline}. [They [assume]{.mark}
that [**superhumanly intelligent robots** would]{.mark} develop goals
like **deposing their masters** or **[tak]{.mark}ing [over the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" [[It is **equally**
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}, Pinker suggests, [that]{.underline}
\"[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence
[[will]{.mark} naturally [develop]{.mark} along female lines: **fully
capable** of solving problems, but [with **no desire** to **annihilate
innocents**]{.mark} or **dominate the civilization**]{.underline}.\"
(14) So [[the fear that computers will become]{.mark} emotionally
[**evil** are **unfounded**, because without]{.mark} the suite of these
evolved [**emotions** it will **never occur to AIs** to **take such
actions**]{.mark} **against us.**]{.underline}

#### Safeguards check. 

**Shermer 17**, Dr. Michael Shermer is the Founding Publisher of Skeptic

Pinker agrees that [[there is]{.mark} **plenty of [time]{.mark}** [to
**plan for all conceivable contingencies** and **build safeguards**
into]{.mark} our **[AI]{.mark} systems**.]{.underline} \"[They would not
need any ponderous \'rules of robotics\']{.underline} or some newfangled
moral philosophy to do this, [just the **same common sense** that went
into the design of food processors, table saws, space heaters, and
automobiles]{.underline}.\" Sure, an ASI would be many orders of
magnitude smarter than these machines, but Pinker reminds us of the AI
hyperbole we\'ve been fed for decades: \"[The worry that an **AI
system** would be so clever at attaining one of the goals programmed
into it (like commandeering energy) that it would **run roughshod** over
the others (like **human safety**) **assumes** that AI will **descend
upon us** faster than we can design **fail-safe**]{.underline}
precaution**[s]{.underline}**. The reality is that [[progress in AI
is]{.mark} **hype-defyingly [slow]{.mark}**, and [there will be **plenty
of time for feedback**]{.mark} from **incremental implementations**,
[with humans **wielding the screwdriver** at **every
stage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" (22) Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt
agrees, responding to the fears expressed by Hawking and Musk this way:
\"[Don\'t you think the [humans would **notice**]{.mark} this,
[and]{.mark} start **[turn]{.mark}ing [off the
computers]{.mark}?**]{.underline}\" He also noted the irony in the fact
that Musk has invested \$1 billion into a company called OpenAI that is
\"promoting precisely AI of the kind we are describing.\" (23)
[[Google\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} own **[[DeepMind]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} developed the concept of
[[an]{.underline}]{.mark} AI **[[off-switch]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
playfully described as a \"big red button\" to be pushed in the event of
an attempted AI takeover. \"[We have proposed a framework to allow a
human operator to **repeatedly safely interrupt** a reinforcement
learning agent while making sure the agent will not learn to **prevent**
or **induce** these interruptions]{.underline},\" write the authors
Laurent Orseau from DeepMind and Stuart Armstrong from the Future of
Humanity Institute, in a paper titled \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\"
They even suggest a precautionary scheduled shutdown every night at 2 AM
for an hour so that both humans and AI are accustomed to the idea.
\"[Safe [interruptibility can]{.mark}]{.underline} be useful to [[**take
control** of a robot that is **misbehaving**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
may lead to irreversible consequences, or to take it out of a delicate
situation, or even to temporarily use it to achieve a task it did not
learn to perform or would not normally receive rewards for this.\" (24)
As well, it is good to keep in mind that artificial intelligence is not
the same as artificial consciousness. Thinking machines may not be
sentient machines. Finally, Andrew Ng of Baidu responded to [Elon
Musk\'s [ASI]{.mark} [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} by noting (in a jab
at the entrepreneur\'s ambitions for colonizing the red planet) it
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} [[be]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[[like]{.mark}
[worrying about **overpop**]{.mark}**ulation [on]{.mark} [Mars]{.mark}**
when we have not even **set foot on the planet yet**]{.underline}.\"

Accessed 3/7/25 TR**

What we know about extinction events tells us that they are [[generally
caused by changes to the
environment]{.underline}](https://academic.oup.com/book/40662?login=false),
and when they are a result of one species' impact on another, extinction
is induced in one of three ways: competition for resources, hunting and
over-consumption or altering the climate or their ecological niche such
that resulting environmental conditions lead to their demise. None of
these three cases apply to AI as it stands. **[AI is not competing for
resources with human beings.]{.underline}** Rather, **[[we provide AI
systems with their resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, from energy and raw
materials to computer chips and network infrastructure. **[[Without
human inputs, AI systems are incapable of maintaining
themselves.]{.underline}]{.mark}** If mining, global shipping, and trade
of precious metals, building and maintenance of power plants,
chip-building factories, data center construction, and internet
cable-laying were all fully automated --- including all of the logistics
and supply chains involved --- then perhaps a superintelligent AI could
decide that humans are superfluous or a drain on resources, and decide
to kill us. For now, AI depends on us, and a **[[superintelligence
would]{.underline}]{.mark}** presumably **[[recognize that fact and seek
to *preserve* humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}** since we are as
fundamental to AI's existence as oxygen-producing plants are to ours.
This makes the evolution of **[[mutualism between AI and humans
a]{.mark} far more [likely outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}** than
competition. Moreover, the path to a fully automated economy --- if that
is the goal --- will be long, with each major step serving as a natural
checkpoint for human intervention. Such automation would require major
advances in hardware as well as software. But robotics is [[not
developing]{.underline}](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/measuring-robot-quality-slowing-improvement-is-a-possibility)
at a pace that's anywhere close to AI's --- and it is unlikely to, since
AI's accelerated progress is tied to the digital world, where
computational power grows exponentially, copying is nearly
instantaneous, and optimization is automated. A **[[scenario where a
superintelligent AI decides]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[[humans]{.underline}]{.mark}** are a drain on resources and
**[[should be eliminated]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather than a key
source of its support, depends on technologies and economic structures
(e.g. completely automated production cycles, from raw material
extraction to advanced manufacturing) that **[[don't

The current systematic review was conducted to investigate the extant
peer reviewed literature focused on the risks associated with AGI. Data
extracted from the eligible articles included, the type of analysis
methods used, risks associated with AGI, and recommended risk
controls/risk management strategies. From the small number of eligible
articles, a broad range of risks were identified including, AGI removing
itself from the control of human owners/managers, AGIs being given or
developing unsafe goals, development of unsafe AGI, AGIs with poor
ethics, morals and values, inadequate management of AGI, and existential
risks. However, **[[issues]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
current state of peer reviewed **[[AGI risk literature emerged.
First]{.mark}, there was a [scarcity of modelling techniques applied to

**[[Fourth, there was a limited amount of peer reviewed

there is a lack of consensus on the terminology used within AGI
research.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is concluded that there is a
critical need to address the multiple issues identified in the current
review. Given that the fate of humanity may be at stake with the
development of unsafe AGI, it is essential that we have reliable, valid,
and rigorous research to guide safe AGI design, implementation and
management.

Given the potential for AGI to shift power dynamics and introduce
unpredictable risks, the EU's commitment to ensuring human-centric
development is crucial. By investing in responsible AGI research, the EU
not only mitigates existential threats but also strengthens its
strategic influence in shaping the future of AI on the global stage.
Conclusion The race toward AGI is not just a technological competition
but a defining moment in global geopolitics. Whether China's DeepSeek
overtakes U.S. dominance or a multipolar AI landscape emerges, the EU
holds the potential to mediate this rivalry by promoting ethical AI
governance. Through regulatory leadership, diplomatic engagement, and
international cooperation, the EU can steer AGI development toward
responsible, inclusive, and human-centric outcomes, preventing the risks
of an uncontrolled AI arms race.

a "genius" and has built a cult-like following in the San Francisco Bay

that if we do this "under anything remotely like the current
circumstances," the "most likely result" will be "that literally
everyone on Earth will die." Since an all-out thermonuclear war probably
won't kill everyone on Earth---the science [[backs this

### AT: Space col turn

#### We should prioritize solving catastrophic risks before focusing on space colonization. It maximizes benefit and prevents further issues post space col.

space colonization", Science Direct, February 2021,

)//LFS---LMH

Humankind is today not only faced with existential, but also
with catastrophic risks. [The [potential damage of catastrophic risks is
smaller than]{.mark} that of [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [still [not morally
negligible]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Issues]{.underline}]{.mark} such as
(extreme) poverty, the global burden of disease, global animal welfare
in farming, and so forth are pressing issues, and they are, in a sense,
[[more acute]{.mark} than existential risks [because they are causing
enormous moral disvalue]{.mark} right
[now]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The shadow that acute catastrophic
risks are casting into the future is not as long as that of existential
risks in terms of overall expected disvalue, but in principle, [[a
similar]{.mark} neglect [argument]{.mark} as with existential [applies
in the context of space col]{.mark}onization.]{.underline} Delaying
[[space colonization in favor of mitigating catastrophic risks]{.mark}
could]{.underline} in some scenarios [[yield greater]{.mark} overall
[moral benefits than]{.mark} achieving [space col]{.mark}onization
[sooner]{.mark} without having mitigated those catastrophic
risks]{.underline}.

[Imagine,]{.underline} for example, [a timeline A in which humankind
delays space colonization in favor of pursuing a cure against all forms
of cancer, and a timeline B in which humankind stresses colonizing
space]{.underline} and does not focus on cancer cures. In [timeline A, a
universal cure is found, and billions of people immediately
benefit]{.underline} (they are spared terrible suffering). In addition,
all future generations benefit as well. In [timeline B, there is no
cure, and humankind has started expanding beyond Earth]{.underline}.
During the colonization delay in [timeline A, billions of people lead
much better lives and once humans in timeline A start colonizing
space]{.underline}, there is no cancer and the disvalue it creates. In
timeline B, however, there would potentially be a colonization-induced
population explosion before a cancer cure is eventually developed, which
would mean that in timeline B, there is enormous disvalue (the
colonizing human population was suffering cancer for a while) that is
not offset by the relatively small gain in moral value of achieving
space colonization sooner.

The case in favor of prioritizing catastrophic risk mitigation and thus
accepting delays space colonization is not as strong as in the context
of existential risks. The case for catastrophic risk prioritization is
contingent on the size of the catastrophic risk in question. It is
possible that not all catastrophic risks are grave enough that they
warrant delaying space colonization. In general, the argument against
neglecting catastrophic risks should not be misunderstood as the cliché
argument of "there are more important problems today than space". The
point is explicitly not that mitigating all existing risks should be
prioritized over colonizing space, but that [[some catastrophic risks
could]{.mark} [create enough future disvalue that delaying space
col]{.mark}onization and mitigating them [yields the better]{.mark}
overall moral [outcome.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### It is ethically unjust to bring humans to colonize space: it prioritizes total happiness over average happiness which means non earth living humans live horrible lives

**Kovic '21** is the co-founder president of the nonprofit think tank
ZIPAR (Zurich Institute of Public Affairs Research (Marko, "Risks of
space colonization", Science Direct, February 2021,
[[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2020.102638]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2020.102638)
)//LFS---LMH

The moral impetus of colonizing space is to increase the probability
that all the potential future humans that could live do come into
existence. But [we do not only want future generations to exist but to
live lives that are actually worth living]{.underline}. However, the
moral landscape of the far future might turn out to be much blurrier.

Imagine, for example, [a scenario in which 10 billion people live on
Earth, and another 2 billion people live on a terraformed
Venus]{.underline}. The [people on Earth are living roughly as good
lives as we are today, but the Venusians are all categorically
suffering:]{.underline} Because [the terraforming was not entirely
successful, some of the original toxic Venusian atmosphere
remained]{.underline}, leading to mild respiratory issues in most of the
population. [Is this state of affairs preferable to there not being any
Venusians at all?]{.underline} On the face of it, yes. After all, the
total [[wellbeing]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/wellbeing) of
humankind is much greater with the 2 billion Venusians than without
them. Mild respiratory issues in 2 billion people are a nontrivial
amount of disvalue, but their existence still seems preferable to their
non-existence.

[Let us imagine a second scenario. There are 10 billion people on Earth
living lives that are roughly as good as the lives we are currently
living, there are 2 billion people on Venus with chronic respiratory
issues, and there are 500 million people on Mars]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, [given Mars' inexistent atmosphere]{.underline} and
magnetosphere, cosmic radiation is battering the surface, including
human habitats. [This has led to permanent damage in the Martians' DNA,
resulting in chronic muscular and skeletal disease. As a result, the
whole Martian population is collectively suffering from a hereditary and
incurable congenital disease.]{.underline} Is this scenario preferable
to there being no Mars colony or to there being no colonization at all?
On the face of it, the answer is again yes: Even though the lives of the
Martians are much less pleasant than the lives of the Earthlings and the
Venusians, the Martians are still living lives that are worth living to
them. [The total amount of wellbeing and happiness of humankind is
greater than if there were no Martians at all.]{.underline}

In these hypothetical scenarios, we are confronted with two classic
problems from population ethics: The so-called repugnant conclusion
([[Parfit,
2004]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#bib0185))
and the non-identity problem ([[Parfit,
2017]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#bib0190)).
[The repugnant conclusion is the observation that our intuitive
judgement of moral desirability, the increase of total happiness or
welfare, is flawed.]{.underline} In our second scenario, the [Martians
are living fairly terrible lives that might barely be worth living
because they are full of suffering. Just because the total amount of
happiness or welfare is greater with the Martians than without
them]{.underline} does not mean that a world with the chronically
suffering Martians is morally desirable. The repugnant conclusion is
relevant in the context of space colonization both because of its
existential scope as well as its empirical plausibility[. Creating
habitats that are able to permanently sustain human life is an immense
technological challenge, and it is not unrealistic to expect that life
beyond Earth will be miserable for quite some time.]{.underline}

The non-identity problem is the observation that something is wrong with
another common moral intuition. Our Martians live miserable lives, but
from their own subjective point of view, that reality is preferable to
the alternative of not existing at all. In a sense, no matter how
terrible life for the Martians is, no moral harm seems to be done
because no person was actively harmed by there being Martians --- the
Martians are not suffering because someone actively and malevolently
hurt them or made them sick; they simply come into existence in their
frail, sickly state. This means that [if a Martian could choose between
existing the way she does and not existing at all, she would almost
certainly pick the former.]{.underline} But something is wrong with this
conclusion. [The Martians are living lives full of suffering, and
clearly, this state of affairs is morally undesirable.]{.underline}

The concrete problems within scenarios in which the repugnant conclusion
and the non-identity problem apply can be described in several ways. For
example, [if we put moral emphasis on average wellbeing rather than just
total wellbeing, we see that the growth of total wellbeing can go hand
in hand with a decrease of average wellbeing.]{.underline} This would
indicate that something has gone wrong. However, average wellbeing alone
might not be a good enough indicator. For example, in an Omelas-like
configuration ([[Le Guin,
1991]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#bib0130)),
[it is conceivable that average wellbeing would increase while a small
subset of people endures hellish suffering.]{.underline} That is why
another approach to understand these problems of population ethics is to
not only focus on happiness and wellbeing, but also on the negative side
of the utilitarian coin, suffering: If some situation or decision
produces a disproportionate amount of suffering compared to wellbeing,
that situation is
undesirable.[[7]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#fn0030)

The repugnant conclusion and the non-identity problem are examples of
how many billions of future humans could live considerably worse lives
than we do today. [That would constitute a moral failure on an
existential or near-existential level --- humankind would still exist,
but the primary result of our expansion beyond Earth would be a gradual
erosion of happiness and a gradual accumulation of
suffering.]{.underline}

#### Space Col only leads to more conflicts between humans.

5.3. Inter-colonial conflict

[Let us]{.underline}, again for the sake of the argument[, assume
tha]{.underline}t the previous problem of reactionary colonies has
somehow been solved or avoided[. Humankind has continued its path of
technological development, and it has established several large clusters
of colonies beyond the Solar system.]{.underline} Assuming that the
fundamental problem of faster-than-light communication has not been
solved yet[, communication between the clusters lags months or even
years, and physical contact between the clusters is rare since travel
takes even longer than communication.]{.underline}

T[he inevitable consequence of such a splintering of human civilization
is that the different clusters of colonies would over time develop
distinct cultures,]{.underline} and with only scarce and delayed contact
with other clusters, a form of intergroup bias ([[Hewstone, Rubin, &
Willis,
2002]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#bib0120)),
[the moral preference of one\'s own in-group over the out-group, would
likely start to manifest. Over time, that us-versus-them
heuristic]{.underline} could help [create distinct and solidified social
identities]{.underline} within the colony clusters ([[Hewstone &
Greenland,
2000](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#bib0115)),
and the beliefs]{.underline} and preferences [about the
outgroup]{.underline} colonies could become more overtly negative. Given
enough time and great enough idiosyncratic development within each
colony cluster, the cultural and moral [connections between the colony
clusters could further erode, and in their place, a sense of dread and
looming danger about the others' goals and preferences could take
hold]{.underline}. Over a long enough period of time and great enough
separation, [the perception that other colonies are a threat could grow;
so much so that taking preventative action and attacking and suppressing
them might seem like the most rational course of action]{.underline}
([[Torres,
2018]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#bib0270)).
Given the scale and the likely technological sophistication of future
weapons systems, a violent conflict between advanced colonies and colony
clusters would create suffering on an astronomical scale.

Of course, [the prospect of inter-colonial conflict is somewhat
speculative]{.underline} ([[Cirkovic,
2019]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0016328720301270#bib0060)).
[But given humankind\'s past experiences, violent conflict clearly seems
within the realm of the possible]{.underline}. That does not mean that
such an almost immeasurably terrible conflict is unavoidable. Even the
slightest probability of such conflict, however, means immense potential
expected disvalue.

AE

[Defense and Security Concerns]{.underline}

One of the [concerns raised]{.underline} by critics [of the [L]{.mark}aw
of the [S]{.mark}ea [T]{.mark}reaty]{.underline} is [that it
could]{.underline} be used to [sharply [limit U.S.]{.mark} military
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among the examples they cite
is [Article 20]{.underline}, which [stipulates]{.underline}: "In the
territorial sea, [submarines and]{.underline} other [[u]{.mark}nderwater
[v]{.mark}ehicle[s]{.mark} are [required to navigate]{.mark} on the
[surface]{.mark} and]{.underline} to [[show]{.mark} their
[flag]{.mark}]{.underline}."8

Proponents of the treaty counter that this provision merely establishes
the conditions for invoking a "right of innocent passage" in the
territorial waters of another nation.9 The "right of innocent passage"
is the right of any nation's ships to traverse continuously and
expeditiously through the territorial waters of a coastal nation,
subject to certain conditions.10

[Because Article 20 doesn't mention "innocent passage," this provision
may [provide opponents]{.mark} of U.S. military operations a
[pretext]{.mark}]{.underline} -- albeit a fairly weak one -- [for
[claim]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [the surfacing requirement applies
[to all U.S. submarines]{.mark}]{.underline} operating [in territorial
waters]{.underline}. Such claims would be unlikely to prevail, as it is
fairly clear, based on the context, that this provision deals with
innocent passage.

Advocates of the treaty also argue that Law of the Sea Treaty merely
maintains the status quo for submarines passing through territorial
waters because the United States is already a party to the 1958
Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone which, they
contend, contains similar language.11 U.S. submarines have traversed
territorial waters while submerged over the past 48 years, they say,
largely unaffected by the Territorial Sea Convention's surfacing
requirement.

Where submarines are concerned, they appear to be correct.

But [Article 20]{.underline} also [adds something completely
new]{.underline}: The [requirement that "other underwater vehicles"
navigate on the surface]{.underline}.12 The [[surfacing]{.mark}
requirement would]{.underline} thus [presumably apply
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
([[AUVs]{.underline}]{.mark}) [and]{.underline} Remotely Operated
Underwater Vehicles ([[ROVs]{.underline}]{.mark}), [among
[others]{.mark}]{.underline} (including, presumably, the next generation
of such vessels) for the first time.

[AUVs]{.underline}, unmanned underwater drones, [and ROVs]{.underline},
underwater vehicles controlled by operators at the surface, [have
numerous [military applications]{.mark}]{.underline}, including [[mine
detection]{.mark} and [neutralization]{.mark}]{.underline},
sur[veillance and [inspection]{.mark} of underwater installations and
topography]{.underline}, [among others]{.underline}.13

[Some of these activities are otherwise consistent with]{.underline} the
Law of the Sea Treaty's definition of "[innocent passage]{.underline}."
An AUV or ROV used to detect mines to protect a ship exercising its
right of innocent passage, for example, appears to meet the requirement
that it engage only in activities with "direct bearing on passage."
[But]{.underline} because these vehicles [[must]{.mark} [be
submerged]{.mark} to be used effectively]{.underline} they [would be
considered "prejudicial to]{.underline} the [peace, good order and
security]{.underline} of the state" by doing so, even though advancing
the peace, [good order and security is precisely the purpose for which
they would be used.]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} the U.S[. ratifies]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[L]{.underline}aw [o]{.underline}f the [S]{.underline}ea
[T]{.underline}reaty, the [[use]{.mark} of AUVs and ROVs]{.underline}
for these and other purposes [could be [reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[Opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}** of [the treaty]{.underline} also
contend that it [could [inhibit]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[U.S]{.underline}.'s [ability]{.underline}]{.mark} [to [pursue]{.mark}
international [terrorists]{.mark} and [prevent]{.mark} the
[transport]{.mark}ation [of w]{.mark}]{.underline}eapons of
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ass [[d]{.underline}]{.mark}estruction on the
sea.14 They appear to be correct.

Article 110 of the Law of the Sea Treaty specifies military ships are
"not justified in boarding \[a foreign ship\] unless there is reasonable
grounds for suspecting that: (a) the ship is engaged in piracy; (b) the
ship is engaged in the slave trade; (c) the ship is engaged in
unauthorized broadcasting...; (d) the ship is without nationality or (e)
...the ship is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship."
[Boarding of ships involved in the [illicit drug trade]{.mark} [is also
permitted]{.mark}]{.underline}.15

Note that [boarding of ships engaged in "unauthorized broadcasts"
is]{.underline} considered to be [justified, but boarding ships carrying
terrorists or w]{.underline}eapons of [m]{.underline}ass
[d]{.underline}estruction [is not]{.underline}.

Unauthorized broadcasting, by the way, is not only a justification to
board, but for certain countries, a requirement under the treaty.16
Policymakers would be wise to remember that the U.S. has itself engaged
in "unauthorized broadcasts," using such vessels as the Coastal
Messenger, a mobile transmitting station for Voice of America broadcasts
behind the Iron Curtain during the 1950s and 1960s.17

[The treaty does permit states to pursue, apprehend and board ships for
violation of other laws]{.underline} and regulations, too, but [only if
the state is in "hot pursuit"]{.underline} of the ship. To qualify as
"hot pursuit," such pursuit [must begin in the]{.underline} "[internal
waters]{.underline}, the [archipelagic waters]{.underline}, the
[territorial sea or]{.underline} the [contiguous zone of the pursing
State]{.underline}, and may only be continued outside the territorial
sea or the contiguous zone" if the pursuit has been uninterrupted.18

[States that detain ships for reasons]{.underline} [or]{.underline} by
[means]{.underline} [other]{.underline} [than]{.underline} those
[prescribed]{.underline} in the Law of the Sea Treaty [could
find]{.underline} their [actions subject to review and judgment
by]{.underline} the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea
([ITLOS]{.underline}) in Hamburg, Germany.

The Law of the Sea Treaty normally gives states the option, by mutual
consent, of choosing between ITLOS, the International Court of Justice
or "arbitral tribunals" to settle their disputes. When agreement between
the states involved in the dispute can not be reached, an arbitral
tribunal would be given jurisdiction in the case.

When provisional measures are sought, however -- as they likely would be
when ships are detained -- the rules are different. Provisional measures
are akin to temporary injunctions -- orders requiring one to do
something or cease doing something -- in the interest of preventing
irreparable harm. Article 290, paragraph 5 of the Law of the Sea Treaty
specifies that ITLOS would automatically adjudicate such disputes when
states can not reach agreement on the method of adjudication or
arbitration "within two weeks from the date of the request for
provisional measures."19

As Jeremy Rabkin, professor of government at Cornell University, has
noted: "The only important category of dispute where one party can force
another to answer before ITLOS is when a ship has been detained on the
high seas and the complaining party seeks immediate release."20

The [prospects that disputes such as these taken to ITLOS would be ruled
in the U.S.'s favor are poor.]{.underline} [Many [ITLOS]{.mark}
[judges]{.mark}]{.underline}, certainly a clear majority, [are [from
countries]{.mark} that have]{.underline} either [been [openly hostile to
the]{.mark} U]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates or are at
best unreliable allies. [Among the countries represented]{.underline} on
ITLOS [are South Africa, China, Russia, Tanzania, Lebanon, Brazil,
Argentina and France]{.underline}.21

[ITLOS]{.underline} certainly [could [complicate]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [U.S.]{.underline}'s [[efforts]{.mark} to [interdict
terrorists]{.mark} and w]{.underline}eapons of [m]{.underline}ass
[d]{.underline}estruction.

For example, [if the U.S. chose to act on]{.underline} intelligence
[information that a foreign-flagged ship]{.underline} (perhaps flying
the flag of Syria, Iran or North Korea) [was carrying terrorists and
boarded]{.underline} the ship, [the U.S. could expect to]{.underline}
have to [answer to ITLOS]{.underline}.

Finally, opponents of the Law of the Sea Treaty contend that Article 88
of the treaty, which stipulates that "the high seas shall be reserved
for peaceful purposes" together with Article 301's requirement to
refrain from "any threat or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any state" have the potential of
unduly constraining U.S. defense operations on the high seas.22

Proponents counter that warships of all major powers freely travel
through the high seas even though the treaty is already in force for
nations that have ratified it,23 which, as of this writing, stood at 149
nations.24 But the U.S.'s circumstances are very different than those of
the 149 parties to the treaty. [As the world's only remaining
superpower, the U.S. is the only nation capable of extended, extensive
long-range maritime operations.]{.underline}25 What's more, [the U.S.
has military obligations that other nations]{.underline} simply
[do]{.underline} [n]{.underline}o[t]{.underline}. Many of the parties to
the treaty26 don't have organized navies. Others don't have significant
ones.27 Consequently, most parties to the treaty have less interest in
the military implications of Article 88 than does the United States. The
ratification of the treaty by these nations therefore should not be the
yardstick by which the risks to U.S. military interests are measured.

[Supporters]{.underline} of the treaty also [argue that Article
301]{.underline} would have little impact on U.S. military operations as
the provision [is the same as Article 2(4) of the U.N.
Charter]{.underline}.28 Although these two provisions are similar,
[there are]{.underline} some [key differences]{.underline}.

For one thing, the bodies responsible for enforcement of the Law of the
Sea Treaty's Article 301 and the U.N. Charter's Article 2(4) are
different.

[Under the U.N. Charter]{.underline}, the Security Council is the
principal enforcement body. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates has a permanent seat on the security council and,
as such, [has veto powers]{.underline}. Under the Law of the Sea Treaty,
enforcement responsibilities fall to such bodies as [ITLOS]{.underline},
which, as noted earlier, [is unlikely to be favorable to U.S.
positions]{.underline}, and the International Seabed Authority
([ISA]{.underline}), with a [similarly unfavorable]{.underline}
composition. The ISA's executive body, the Council, is [composed of
representatives]{.underline} of 36 countries, the [majority]{.underline}
of which [can not be counted on to support U.S. positions]{.underline}.
Its membership includes representatives from the Sudan, Malaysia, China,
Indonesia, South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, Kenya, Guyana, Argentina,
Russia and Myanmar (name given to Burma by its military junta), among
others.29

[Article 301]{.underline} of the Law of the Sea Treaty also has wording
slightly different that the U.N. Charter's Article 2(4), replacing the
more objective phrase "shall refrain from the threat" with a more
[subjective "shall refrain from any threat."]{.underline} This
[opens]{.underline} the [possibility that U.S. military
operations]{.underline} on the high seas [could be inhibited when states
**merely "feel"** threatened by them]{.underline}.

It is in this context that provisions such as Article 88 take on greater
significance.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee determined that the risks to U.S.
military activity were sufficient enough to address them in its
Committee Report. Among other things, it specified that the Senate's
advice and consent for U.S. accession to the Law of the Sea Treaty be
subject to the understanding "that nothing in the Convention referring
to 'peaceful purposes' impairs the inherent right of individual or
collective self-defense or rights during armed conflict."30

Unfortunately, the Committee did not also specify that the Senate's
advice and consent to be subject to the understanding that the United
States has the inherent right to defend itself during peacetime through
pre-emptive action. Pre-emptive action may be required, for example, if
the U.S. learns through reliable intelligence that a specific ship is
carrying terrorists, weapons of mass destruction or both.

Even with such conditions, the U.S. would likely gain little advantage.

That's because [[Article 309]{.underline}]{.mark} of the treaty
[specifies]{.underline} that [[no]{.underline}]{.mark} "reservations or
[[exceptions may be made]{.underline}]{.mark} to this Convention [unless
expressly permitted by other articles]{.underline} of this Convention."
While states are permitted to declare exceptions pertaining to military
activities when ratifying the treaty under Article 298, such
declarations would only free States from the dispute resolution process
outlined in Articles 286-296. They would still be obligated to the
dispute resolution requirements contained in Articles 279-285.31

## Case

### Impact\-\--Disease Wars

#### AND it spirals into nuclear war.

Chairman at the Japan Atomic Energy Commission; Journal for Peace and
Nuclear Disarmament, "Pandemic Futures and Nuclear Weapon Risks: The
Nagasaki 75th Anniversary pandemic-nuclear nexus scenarios final
report," vol. 1\]

The Challenge: Multiple Existential Threats

The relationship between pandemics and war is as long as human history.
Past [[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} have [**set** the **scene** for
wars by **[weaken]{.mark}**ing **[societies]{.mark}**, undermining
resilience, [and **exacerbating**]{.mark} civil and inter-state
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Other disease outbreaks have erupted
during wars, in part due to the appalling public health and battlefield
conditions resulting from war, in turn sowing the seeds for new
conflicts. In the post-Cold War era, [pandemics]{.underline} have
[spread [with **unprecedented speed** due to]{.mark} increased
**[mobility]{.mark}** created [by **globalization**]{.mark}, especially
between **urbanized** areas]{.underline}. Although there are positive
signs that scientific advances and rapid innovation can help us manage
pandemics, it is likely that deadly infectious viruses will be a
challenge for years to come.

The COVID-19 is the most demonic pandemic threat in modern history. It
has erupted at a juncture of other existential global threats, most
importantly, accelerating climate change and resurgent nuclear
threat-making. The most important issue, therefore, is how the
coronavirus (and future pandemics) will increase or decrease the risks
associated with these twin threats, climate change effects, and the next
use of nuclear weapons in war.5

Today, the nine nuclear weapons arsenals not only can annihilate
hundreds of cities, but also cause nuclear winter and mass starvation of
a billion or more people, if not the entire human species. Concurrently,
climate change is enveloping the planet with more frequent and intense
storms, accelerating sea level rise, and advancing rapid ecological
change, expressed in unprecedented forest fires across the world.
Already stretched to a breaking point in many countries, the current
pandemic may overcome resilience to the point of near or actual collapse
of social, economic, and political order.

In this extraordinary moment, it is timely to reflect on the existence
and possible uses of weapons of mass destruction under pandemic
conditions -- most importantly, nuclear weapons, but also chemical and
biological weapons. [Moments of **extreme [crisis]{.mark}** and
vulnerability]{.underline} can [[prompt **aggressive**]{.mark} and
counterintuitive [**actions** that]{.mark}]{.underline} in turn may
[**[destabilize]{.mark}** already **[precarious]{.mark}**ly **balanced**
threat [systems]{.mark}, underpinned by]{.underline} conventional and
[**nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}, as well as the threat of
weaponized chemical and biological technologies. Consequently, [the
[**risk** of]{.mark} the **use** of]{.underline} weapons of mass
destruction (**[WMD]{.underline}**), [especially **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}**, **[increase]{.mark}**s at such times, possibly
**[sharply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The COVID-19 pandemic is clearly driving massive, rapid, and
unpredictable changes that will redefine every aspect of the human
condition, including WMD -- just as the world wars of the first half of
the 20th century led to a revolution in international affairs and
entirely new ways of organizing societies, economies, and international
relations, in part based on nuclear weapons and their threatened use. In
a world reshaped by pandemics, nuclear weapons -- as well as correlated
non-nuclear WMD, nuclear alliances, "deterrence" doctrines, operational
and declaratory policies, nuclear extended deterrence, organizational
practices, and the existential risks posed by retaining these
capabilities -- are all up for redefinition.

A pandemic has potential to destabilize a nuclear-prone conflict by
incapacitating the supreme nuclear commander or commanders who have to
issue nuclear strike orders, creating uncertainty as to who is in
charge, how to handle nuclear mistakes (such as errors, accidents,
technological failures, and entanglement with conventional operations
gone awry), and opening a brief opportunity for a first strike at a time
when the COVID-infected state may not be able to retaliate efficiently
-- or at all -- due to leadership confusion. In some nuclear-laden
conflicts, a state might use a pandemic as a cover for political or
military provocations in the belief that the adversary is distracted and
partly disabled by the pandemic, increasing the risk of war in a
nuclear-prone conflict. At the same time, a pandemic may lead nuclear
armed states to increase the isolation and sanctions against a nuclear
adversary, making it even harder to stop the spread of the disease, in
turn creating a pandemic reservoir and transmission risk back to the
nuclear armed state or its allies.

In principle, the common threat of the pandemic might induce
nuclear-armed states to reduce the tension in a nuclear-prone conflict
and thereby the risk of nuclear war. It may cause nuclear adversaries or
their umbrella states to seek to resolve conflicts in a cooperative and
collaborative manner by creating habits of communication, engagement,
and mutual learning that come into play in the nuclear-military sphere.
For example, militaries may cooperate to control pandemic transmission,
including by working together against criminal-terrorist non-state
actors that are trafficking people or by joining forces to ensure that a
new pathogen is not developed as a bioweapon.

To date, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the isolation of
some nuclear-armed states and provided a textbook case of the failure of
states to cooperate to overcome the pandemic. [**[Borders]{.mark}** have
**slam**med shut, **[trade]{.mark}** shut down, [and **budgets**
blown]{.mark} out]{.underline}, creating enormous pressure to focus on
immediate domestic priorities. [**[Fo]{.mark}**reign
**[po]{.mark}**licies]{.underline} have [[become]{.mark} markedly more
**[nationalistic]{.mark}**. Dependence on **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline} may [increase as states seek to **buttress** a
global **re-spatialization**]{.underline}6 [of all dimensions of human
interaction at all levels to **manage pandemics**]{.underline}. The
effect of nuclear threats on leaders may make it less likely -- or even
impossible -- to achieve the kind of concert at a global level needed to
respond to and administer an effective vaccine, making it harder and
even impossible to revert to pre-pandemic international relations. [The
[result is]{.mark} that]{.underline} some [[states]{.mark} may
**[proliferate]{.mark}** their own **nuc**lear weapon**s**, further
**[reinforcing]{.mark}** the **[spiral]{.mark}** of
**conflicts**]{.underline} contained by nuclear threat, [[with
**cascading effects** on]{.mark} the risk of **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
**[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [[weight]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international [sanctions]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the demands of [war]{.mark} have exposed and
[intensified]{.mark} [existing shortcomings]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[Russia's]{.mark} [military]{.mark}-[industrial]{.mark}
[base]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia is [currently [struggling]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [build]{.mark} genuinely [new]{.mark} and
[tech]{.mark}nologically advanced systems.]{.underline} Instead, it is
[[relying]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [Soviet-era legacy
system]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} and research. It is also [[heavily
dependent]{.mark} [on]{.mark} third-party]{.underline} [suppliers to
replace essential [Western]{.mark}-made [components]{.mark} -- with
[import]{.mark} [substitutions]{.mark} and domestic production
[fail]{.mark}ing to meet requirements.]{.underline}

[[Despite]{.mark} Russia's [record]{.mark} levels of military
[spending]{.mark}]{.underline}, our [research shows]{.underline} that
the current state of its military [industry]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} one of [regression]{.underline}, contrary to what the
Kremlin would have the world believe. [Production will likely have to be
simplified and slowed over the coming years,]{.underline} while Russia
will be forced to accept reduced quality of outputs and will suffer
[from '[innovation]{.mark} [stagnation']{.mark}]{.underline} in its
technological research and development.

These problems are not insurmountable. [Russia will continue to
muddle]{.underline} through and keep [producing systems that are
'[good]{.mark} [enough']{.mark} to pose a sustained threat [to]{.mark}
[Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} [But being 'good enough' to prolong a war

with]{.mark} [Western]{.mark} (and Chinese) advances in military
[tech]{.mark}nology over the [long]{.mark}er [term]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The West's ultimate goal must be to encourage the degradation of
Russia's military industry, reducing the overall threat from Russia by
creating the conditions for further decline.

Russia has spent record amounts on defence over recent years, with its
spending set to exceed 6 per cent of GDP in 2025. Despite this, the
country's military-industrial complex (OPK) has been [degraded by a
decade of international targeted sanctions and by the Ukraine war
effort]{.underline}. Russia's ability to produce military hardware has
been severely impacted, and its ability to innovate and adopt modern
military technology constrained as a result of these challenges, as well
as pre-existing weaknesses. The OPK is currently struggling to build
genuinely new and technologically advanced systems. Instead, it is
relying on Soviet-era legacy systems and research.

### Extraction DA

#### Arctic extraction causes ocean pollution.

//Pen-MK

[A]{.underline} potential [**problematic** issue]{.underline} in
particular, as identified by Willaert, [is]{.underline} for example,
'[**whether** the **d**eep **s**ea **m**ining regime applicable to the
**Area** is **well-aligned** with the one governing]{.underline} the
same activities on [the **continental shelf'**]{.underline}.31 He
explains that activities similar to deep-sea mining are developing
within areas under national jurisdiction (seabed mining), and argues
that '[prominent **mismatches** between the **two regimes** might cause
**problems**]{.underline} and concerns'.32 [One]{.underline} such
[problem is]{.underline}, as Willaert notes, the fact that
[**exploration** and **exploitation**]{.underline} operations [on the
**continental shelf** are governed by]{.underline} the **[national
laws]{.underline}** of coastal states which leads to various regulatory
frameworks. He points out that it would be 'important that these
domestic laws complement the efforts of the international community to
protect deep sea ecosystems by including adequate environmental
standards and conditions'.33 He underlines, '\[a\]fter all, the various
species living in and near the seabed or in the water column above do
not take these legal boundaries into account and will not confine
themselves to one or the other zone'.34 Moreover, Willaert rightly
points out that [activities on the continental shelf]{.underline} of a
coastal state '[may have a **transboundary** **environmental
impact'**]{.underline}.35 As a consequence he stresses that [it would be
very important]{.underline} that '[**d**eep **s**ea
**m**ining]{.underline} activities [within national jurisdiction are
**adequately regulated**]{.underline} and supervised, [**avoiding** any
**legal gaps**]{.underline}'.36

To the extent that the meaning of 'effective control' (as noted earlier)
in this context may not yet be sufficiently clear, it would appear that
there is also a need for clarification of what the rules concerning
transboundary harm would be. Further, the extended continental shelf
regime, as aptly noted by Willaert, would raise additional questions
regarding the way in which harmonization of the different regimes for
seabed mining in the different areas should be achieved.37

To Verlaan it is '\[**[UNCLOS]{.underline}**'\] own [fragmented approach
to the **Area**]{.underline} (defined as "the seabed and ocean floor,
and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction")' which
[would 'not facilitate the task of **ISA**, because **UNCLOS** does
**not limit**]{.underline} its marine [environmental
**protection**]{.underline} requirements [to the
**Area'**]{.underline}.38 She argues that [in the context of
**d**eep-**s**ea **m**ining, the scope of the **ISA's** marine
environmental **responsibilities**]{.underline} in that sense, [extends
to 'the **coastline'**]{.underline}, i.e. [well **beyond** the **Area**
and far into water within **national jurisdiction**]{.underline}, and
must include 'prevention, reduction and control of interference with the
ecological balance of the marine environment'.39

[The above is further **problematized**]{.underline} if one is to
consider [**non-State** **Parties** to **UNCLOS**, raising the need for
an assessment of 'the **precise impact** of **non-ratification**' on the
**d**eep-**s**ea mining plans of said states]{.underline}.40 As put by
Willaert, [this would involve determining]{.underline} the question,
under international law, '[whether]{.underline} or not -- and at what
cost -- [**non-states** parties can exploit]{.underline} the abundant
[**mineral resources** on the **ocean floor'**]{.underline}.41 He
questions: 'Does non-ratification lead to free and unbridled access to
the deep seabed, without any regard to the rules and conditions of the
international regime, or does this preclude states from pursuing their
deep sea mining ambitions?'42

ITLOS can potentially play a role in ensuring that the different legal
frameworks relevant to deep-sea mining are harmonized.

Substantive areas potentially giving rise to disputes

In addition, the challenges regulating deep-sea mining include the
interface with areas upon which very little was known in the past. Some
of the [areas that need to be considered]{.underline} in assessing
deep-sea mining include (1) [the **regulation** of **gas
hydrates**]{.underline}; (2) [the sub-sea **permafrost** in the
**Artic**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} (3) [the potential global
**impact** of **d**eep-**s**ea **m**ining on **biodiversity loss** and
**climate change**]{.underline}. These all can potentially give rise to
new types of disputes before ITLOS.

The regulation of gas hydrates exploration and exploitation

[**Gas hydrates** are 'a **crystalline solid** formed of
water]{.underline} [and gas']{.underline}.43 Looking and acting much
like ice, [they contain **huge amounts** of **methane**]{.underline}.44
[They exist in **huge quantities** in **marine sediments**]{.underline}
in a layer several hundred meters thick [directly below the **sea
floor** and in]{.underline} association with [**permafrost** in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. [**Methane hydrate** is]{.underline} believed
to be '[the world's **largest** **natural gas** resource]{.underline}'
[and can be found in]{.underline} the shallow sediments of many [**deep
ocean** areas]{.underline}.45 Scientific scholars note that [**enormous
amounts** of **methane hydrate** have been found **beneath** **Arctic
permafrost**]{.underline}, beneath Antarctic ice and in sedimentary
deposits along continental margins worldwide.46 [To the extent that
**d**eep-**s**ea **m**ining may]{.underline} tap into resources which
would potentially [release **vast quantities** of
**methane**]{.underline} into the atmosphere, the question is [what
would the **legal consequences** be under **UNCLOS**]{.underline}? What
would be the implications of this for the regulation of deep-sea mining?
So far, [the impacts of **methane hydrate** mining have **not** been
**examined** under]{.underline} the prism of the
**[UNCLOS]{.underline}** by ITLOS. Admittedly, however, this new
potential activity, the exploitation of gas hydrates, may give rise --
as noted by former President of ITLOS Vladimir Golitsyn -- to 'new types
of disputes before the Tribunal in the years to come'.47

Scientists warn that '[**hydrate mining** could generate **sub-marine**
**landslides'**]{.underline}, and that '[dissociating the **methane
hydrates** would **destabilize** the **sea floor'**]{.underline}, and
[in the worst-case scenario]{.underline} that 'huge packages of
[sediments could slide downhill, **triggering** powerful **tsunamis**
along coastal areas]{.underline}'.48 Yan et al. suggest that [the
current **legal framework** is **not adequately** **prepared** to
**address** **transboundary harm** triggered by]{.underline} the
[exploitation of offshore **methane hydrates**]{.underline}, in
particular because 'the technology of such extraction is still at an
experimental state, and [potential **risks** remain
**uncertain**]{.underline} -- and even untraceable -- [for
**cross-jurisdictional** **claims'**]{.underline}.49 While Yan et al.'s
focus is the Deep Seabed Mining Law of China, which the authors identify
as a predominant nation exploring offshore methane hydrate extraction,
their observations also consider UNCLOS.50 What would 'the
responsibility to ensure' by States, under article 139 paragraph 2 of
UNCLOS entail in methane hydrate exploration? As noted by Vöneky and
Höfelmeier, the scope of such a 'responsibility to ensure' is of an
obligation of conduct or due diligence, not of result.51 The obligation
does not impose strict liability.52 In international law -- as they
observe -- the formulation has especially been used in connection with
the general obligations of States to prevent transboundary harm stemming
from activities conducted in their territory.53 Yan et al. observe, in
addition, that there is a need for outlining the scope of liability in
the context of methane hydrate exploration, and the particular
obligations coming from both sponsorship and application with a plan of
exploration and exploitation.54 The Seabed Disputes Chamber has already
held that the precautionary approach is part of the due diligence
obligation itself.55 But what would that entail in the context of
methane hydrate exploration or even exploitation?

A question is also raised on whether the 'Draft Articles on the
Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities' ('Draft
Articles on the Prevention of Transboundary Harm')56 and 'Principles on
the Allocation of Loss in the Case of Transboundary Harm Arising Out of
Hazardous Activities'57 ('Principles on the Allocation of Loss' or 'The
Principles') provide approaches and principles that could be useful to
regulate methane hydrate exploration and exploitation.58 For example,
how is one to ensure the victim of transboundary damage in a case of
methane hydrate exploration/exploitation access to prompt and adequate
compensation? The commentary of Principle 1 of The Principles on the
Allocation of Loss observes that hazardous activities coming within the
scope of the draft principles are those not prohibited by international
law and involving the 'risk of causing significant transboundary harm
through their physical consequences'.59 The Principles recognize that
'harm could occur despite implementation of the duties of prevention':
Transboundary harm could occur for several other reasons not involving
State responsibility. For instance, there could be a situation where the
preventive measures were followed but actually proved inadequate, or
where the particular risk that cause transboundary harm could not be
identified at the time of initial authorization and hence appropriate
preventive measures are not envisaged. In other words, transboundary
harm could occur accidentally or it may take place in circumstances not
originally anticipated. Further, harm could occur because of gradually
accumulated adverse effects over a period of time.60

Indeed, for the purposes of the Principles it is assumed that duties of
due diligence under the obligations of prevention have been fulfilled.61
Yan et al. observe therefore that the Principles adopt a
strict-liability-'polluter pays' principle to ensure the victim of
transboundary damage has access to prompt and adequate compensation.62
Would this be important to consider in cases of harm arising from the
extraction of methane hydrate, which fits the element of raising a 'risk
of causing significant transboundary harm through their physical
consequences'? Yan et al. see the benefits of following that approach.
Applying strict liability, regardless of fault, could undoubtedly,
suggest the same authors, pressure operators into being more careful
when it comes to applying untested prospecting methods, therefore being
beneficial for the environment, as well as in compliance with the
general precautionary principles.63 Note in that sense that the
Principles would go further than article 22 of Annex III of UNCLOS where
it is stated:

The contractor shall have responsibility or liability for any damage
arising out of wrongful acts in the conduct of its operations, account
being taken of contributory acts or omissions by the Authority.
Similarly, the Authority shall have responsibility or liability for any
damage arising out of wrongful acts in the exercise of its powers and
functions, including violations under article 168, paragraph 2, account
being taken of contributory acts or omissions by the contractor.
Liability in every case shall be for the actual amount of damage.

Is there room for using such an approach reflected in the Principles
within the interpretation of UNCLOS article 304?64 More generally, there
is also the question of what measures in the event of both national and
international regulatory breaches by involved parties (the sponsoring
States, the enterprises) should be put in place?65 As posited by Yan et
al.: Should monetary penalties be instituted? Should the ISA wield the
authority to deliver such penalties?66 The above questions can well be
the subject of a further Advisory Opinion by the Seabed Disputes
Chambers if prompted to do so.

Lastly, there are also warnings in scientific studies that '[an
increased **release** of **methane** from the **oceans** could
**accelerate** **climate change**]{.underline}'.67 To date climate
change has not yet come to the consideration of ITLOS. As Boyle noted,
UNCLOS 'was negotiated at a time when climate change was not yet part of
the international agenda'.68 At the same time, he argues, UNCLOS was
never meant to be a 'static or immutable legal regime'.69 It would
appear therefore, that [the potential impacts of **hydrate mining** and
correlative issues of climate change]{.underline} are matters likely to
[**necessitate** **legal clarification** under **UNCLOS**]{.underline}.
Former President of ITLOS Vladimir Golitsyn would agree. In his opening
Address to the Symposium ITLOS at 20: Looking into the Future, he
observed: '[The **exploitation** of **gas hydrates** has the potential
to **inflict** **significant harm** on the **marine environment** and
**negatively affect** the earth's **climate**]{.underline}' as [there is
'the risk of **methane escape** into the atmosphere, which could further
**intensify** the **greenhouse effect**]{.underline}'. 70

DOA: 7/23/2025, //shubh

Whether it was from elementary school teachers, elderly white neighbors
or history textbooks, the label has always defined me. As I headed into
my first year at Yale University, I felt confident that I would be in a
place where the campus community would challenge this racial
terminology. In the past few years, however, I have encountered
non-Native people --- both professors and students --- using the word to
describe Native Americans, seemingly without a second thought. In these
moments, [I felt **[demeaned]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[reduced]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} "**[just an Indian]{.mark}**."]{.underline} I am an
indigenous woman from an Ojibwe tribal nation in Sault Ste. Marie,
Michigan. I am descended from a long line of passionate Ojibwe mothers
and grandmothers. I am a junior at an elite academic institution
pursuing a degree in. These pieces of my identity coexist and intersect
with one another. Related: People at Yale reflexively designate me and
other Native people as "Indians" in classroom settings as well as in
casual conversations: during the first week of my freshman year, I
talked to a senior who wanted to know which "Indian tribe" I belonged
to. [The **continued [use]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [word]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} non-Native **[students]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[professors]{.mark}** [to describe **indigenous people**]{.mark}
[ignores]{.mark} the fact that it is an **[archaic label]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} **[fails]{.mark}** [to represent]{.mark} the
**[strength]{.mark}** [and **diversity**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [indigenous
peoples]{.mark} across North America.]{.underline} In an interview with
Ronald Wright for, indigenous author Lenore Keeshig-Tobias exclaims:
"[How I **loathe** the term 'Indian.' ['Indian']{.mark} is [used to
**sell things**]{.mark} --- souvenirs, cigars, **cigarettes**, gasoline,
**cars** ... 'Indian' is a [**figment** of the **white man's
imagination**]{.mark}."]{.underline} I recently sat down with Gabriella
Blatt, a past president of the Association of Native Americans at Yale,
to discuss the use of "Indian" at U.S. institutions of higher learning.
As president of the organization, she focused her work at Yale on
increasing Native representation and raising awareness of contemporary
issues. ["I think it's **completely [unacceptable]{.mark}** [to use the
word 'Indian]{.mark},' " she told me, "[especially **within
classes**]{.mark} that focus on **ethnicity**, **race** [and]{.mark}
migration or **[indigenous studies]{.mark}**. When people use the term
in my classes, it makes me feel like an **artifact of the past**. If you
look at it, a lot of the [**racial slurs** against Native
Americans]{.mark} are **[derived]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the word
['Indian.']{.mark} " The usage also [promotes]{.mark} the **problematic
[assumption]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [Native Americans]{.mark}
[comprise]{.mark} a **single**, **[monolithic
community]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Today, there are over five million
indigenous people and 573 federally recognized Native nations within the
boundaries of the United States, and each of these tribal nations has a
distinct history, language, culture and way of governance. For example,
while the Blackfoot and other Great Plains tribal communities
historically lived in teepees for maximum mobility, the Iroquois
constructed more permanent longhouses of wood and tree bark. Ojibwe
peoples of the Great Lakes region incorporate the into their cultural
beliefs and ceremonies, while many Pueblo traditional beliefs are
grounded in a relationship with ancestral spirits called. In light of
this diversity, "[Indian" is an [**insufficient way** to]{.mark}
[reflect]{.mark} the **[sovereign status]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
individual [tribes]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the **[cultural
differences]{.mark}** among them]{.underline}. It is as non-specific of
a description as "European" would be to describe both French and German
people. The issue becomes more complex, however, when generational
differences and government terminology are taken into account. Because
these challenges are fairly contemporary, older Native American
individuals often identify more with the name they have been called
their entire lives. In a 2015 with Native Times, an elder from Standing
Rock said, "If some Indians want to be called Native Americans or
Natives, let them be called that, but I was born an Indian and I shall
die an Indian." Related: The U.S. government continues to use the term
when naming policies and executive agencies. For example, the continues
to be the name of the agency under the Department of the Interior that
manages land held in trust for Native American tribes. Politicians from
both sides of the aisle use "Indian Country" to describe the collective
of Native communities and lands within the boundaries of the United
States. The use of "Indian" in this way is codified into government
structure --- making it legally accurate, though still problematic,
reflecting the centuries-long history of the federal government's
attempt to control Native resources and forcefully assimilate Natives
into white society. Sitting in the conference room of the at Yale, Blatt
and I took some time to admire its wall of tribal flags. An array of
colors, patterns and cultural symbols, each flag represents the nation
of an indigenous student at Yale --- we are not Indians but Ojibwes,
Navajos, Cherokees and more. Not Indian, but indigenous. Describing
someone by their specific tribal nation is preferred, but 'Native
American' and 'indigenous' are acceptable as well. Above all, it's
always best to ask what someone would prefer to be called so that they
may make their own choice of identification. Non-Native supporters of
the label "Indian" argue that the name is too deeply entrenched in the
social and political history of the United States --- used by
governments, textbooks, movies and sports teams --- to be changed. In
response, I urge them to consider indigenous presence in the context of
a society where educational and political institutions attempt to
confront the harmful legacies of the past. As highly educated people who
exist in spaces of extreme social and political power, we have a
responsibility to seek more accurate and respectful ways of defining our
communities. When I see pro-slavery rhetoric rightfully ripped from
campus, and when I share my preferred pronouns in class to foster a
gender-inclusive environment, I'm inspired to think of my own community.
I ask: Why not us, too?

Political scientists who study [the policy process]{.underline} attempt
to [provide a framework that]{.underline} will [guide students
from]{.underline} the **[emergence of a problem to the final enactment

policy development [shows the process]{.underline} to be one [of
**sequential stages of activity**]{.underline}. A survey of the
literature [shows]{.underline} that there is [**little disagreement**
about what the stages are]{.underline}, though some political scientists
are attempting to move beyond the traditional framework of stages. l
Where most scholars disagree is on the impact each stage has upon the
next, and on what should and should not occur at each stage. [The
**commonly agreed**]{.underline}-on [stages are]{.underline}

[**1**. Problem Recognition]{.underline} and Issue Identification: This
stage draws the attention of policy makers to a problem that might
require governmental action; problems, if legitimate, then become
issues.

[**2**. Agenda Setting]{.underline}: The issue is given the status of a

[**3**. Policy Formulation: **Proposals are developed**]{.underline} for

[**4**. Policy Adoption: Efforts]{.underline} are made [to **obtain

[**5**. Policy Implementation]{.underline}: The policy [**mandate** is
aimed at through **public programs**]{.underline} and the federal
bureaucracy, often with citizen, state, and local government
cooperation.

THE PROCESS OF POLICY MAKING: ISSUE IDENTIFICATION AND AGENDA FORMATION

Where do issues come from? Why are some issues ignored? How does an
issue gain access to the political system? These are crucial questions
to answer when looking at the first stages of the policy process cycle.
Before we see how the issue agenda is set, we must determine exactly
what is meant by the term "agenda." Generally the issue agenda is the
list of subjects or problems to which governmental and nongovernmental
actors are paying serious attention at any given point in äme.2 Agenda
setting is the narrowing of the set of issues that the actors will focus
on and address.

There are different types of agendas. They can be highly general, such
as a list of items that occupy the attention of the president, or they
can be highly specialized, such as the agendas of congressional
subcommittees. According to Cobb and Elder, agendas can be classified
into two main types.3 The first such agenda is the systemic agenda. This
covers all issues that are generally recognized to deserve public
attention and are matters within the government\'s legitimate
jurisdiction. An example of such a matter would be education. The second
type of agenda is the institutional agenda. Cobb and Elder state that
this involves all issues explicitly up for active and serious
consideration by the authoritative decision makers, for example, actual
congressional bills.4 The institutional agenda is less abstract and
narrower in scope than the systemic agenda, and the priorities of both
do not necessarily correspond. Often there is considerable discrepancy
between the two agendas,

[The "**normal" agenda sequence** is for issues to arrive on the
systemic agenda before]{.underline} they are put onto [the institutional
agenda]{.underline}. This creates a problem for policy makers and other
involved actors in that, if the lag time between moving from the
systemic to the institutional agenda is too great, the issue could fall
apart and prove critical to the political system. The viability of the
political system is a function of its ability to cope with the lag
between these two agendas. It is also important to note that both
agendas have their own sets of biases and therefore subject to conflict.

Why do some issues move onto the agenda while other issues are ignored?
The chances of an issue proceeding to the agenda depends on how it is
generally perceived within the political system. If an issue is thought
to be a conflict or a crisis, if an issue is advocated by a visible
interest group, or if an issue is backed by the bureaucracy, there is a
good chance that the issue will move on to the agenda. Such perceptions
act as triggers.5 Thus agenda setting begins when decision makers first
recognize a problem, feel the need for government to address it, and
start to search for a solution.

The [agenda-setting]{.underline} process [is **complex and
multifaceted**]{.underline}. In order to comprehend it, [one must look
not only at]{.underline} the [dynamics of the process but]{.underline}
also at the [interactions and **roles of the various governmental and
nongovernmental participants**]{.underline}. John Kingdon is an author
who provides such a framework,6 using four organizing concepts to form a
model of agenda building. First, agenda setting should be viewed as a
garbage can that consists of the coupling of streams of problems,
politics, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities.7 Next,
policy ideas are recombined and incubated over the years in \"policy
communities\" of specialists and experts. Third, "policy entrepreneurs"
provide the linkage between ideas and decision makers. Such individuals
are advocates who are willing to spend their resources in the promotion
of an idea; they might be elected officials, civil lobbyists, academics,
or journalists. Finally, there are structures of opportunity for ideas
to become part of the agenda. Kingdon refers to such structures as
"policy windows," which "policy entrepreneurs" must take advantage of.
In Kingdon\'s model, policy windows open and close as a result of
changes in the problem and political streams.

POLICY FORMULATION AND ADOPTION

[**Policy formulation** is the creation of]{.underline} relevant and
supportable [**courses of action** for dealing with problems and **does
not always result in the adoption of policy**]{.underline}.8 Because a
problem or issue arrives on the agenda, it does not necessarily mean
that the government will act effectively to resolve it.9 [**Various
actors are involved** in policy formulation, including
**legislators**]{.underline}, the **[president]{.underline}** and his
advisors, the various departments and **[agencies]{.underline}** of the
executive branch, and interest groups.10 Similarly, at the state and
local level of policy making, legislators, executives, agency staff, and
interest groups are involved.

[**Formulation is a two-step process**, **First**]{.underline}, a
[general decision has to be made about what]{.underline}, if anything,
[is to be done]{.underline} about a problem. **[Second]{.underline}**,
[**if** something is to be done]{.underline}, a [policy has to be
drafted that, **if adopted**, will carry out identified
objectives]{.underline}. For policy formulation to be successful, it is
essential that policy proposals be adoptable. In other words, policy
proposals have to be formulated that will be [acceptable]{.underline}
not only [to]{.underline} the **[people who make policy
decisions]{.underline}** but also to most other actors. Thus, it is
often the case that decision makers are influenced by what they need to
win policy adoption. Certain provisions will be included and others
dropped, depending upon what builds support for the proposed policy. The
more actors involved in the adoption process, the more difficult it is
to get an "acceptable" proposal. The process of building support for
adoption can be understood as policy legitimation.11 [Policy adoption is
the act of **choosing which policy alternative** will be finally
chosen]{.underline} as the preferred course of action to meet the
problem.

POLICY IMPLEMENTATION

[Implementation starts after]{.underline} the [decision to adopt a
particular course of action is made and ends]{.underline} successfully
[when]{.underline} the [goals]{.underline} sought by the policy [are
achieved]{.underline} and the costs are within reasonable expectations.
Thus [**implementation** can be defined as the **directed change that
follows a policy adoption**. Often a decision by government to \"**do
something**\" is seen]{.underline} by the general public [as the end of
the matter]{.underline}. However, [**in practice**, the policy decision
that emerges from the formulation and adoption stages **sets off a long
and complex chain**]{.underline}---[the implementation
process]{.underline}--- where any multitude of things can go wrong,
including, for example, judicial constraints, abandonment by the public,
and resistance by those who must alter their patterns of behavior so as
to comply with the policy.12 Moreover, there is a tendency for
implementation to become largely bureaucratic and rule laden.13 Thus it
is not uncommon for the original policy to be distorted, for the
original goals to be forgotten, and for bureaucrats to substitute their
own objectives as they implement policies. Thus public policies often
fail to have their intended effects due to the dynamics of the
implementation process.

The Northern Region includes the North Slope and northwest portions of
the state, with the largest cities being Barrow, Kotzebue, and Nome.
With the exception of the highway connecting Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay,
the region is disconnected from the road system and relies mostly on
waterways and small airports for transportation. The predominant Alaska
Native cultures are the Inupiaq and Yup'ik; large mammals such as
whales, walrus, seals, caribou, moose, and others have anchored the
inhabitants' subsistence way of life for millennia. Home to some of the
continent's largest oilfields, the major industries by employment are
oil and gas development followed by mining and professional services.7

The Interior includes a vast section of Alaska's heartland, crisscrossed
by huge rivers and bounded to the south by the Alaska Range. Its largest
city is Fairbanks and the road system connects Fairbanks to Canada,
Prudhoe Bay, and Southcentral Alaska. Fairbanks is also home to an
international airport and the terminus of the Alaska Railroad System.
The predominant Alaska Native cultural group is Tanana Athabascan.
Military bases, the University of Alaska, mining, oil and gas, and the
visitor industry all have a major presence in the region. The largest
employment sectors are education and health, retail trade, and
accommodation and food services.8

Anchorage/Matanuska-Susitna (Mat-Su) is home to more than half of the
state's population, with Anchorage being the largest city and the Mat-Su
Valley to its north being the fastest growing part of the state. The
region is Alaska's best connected region, with the Port of Anchorage,
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, and the Alaska Railroad
servicing the area. As such, it is the commercial center of the state.
Traditionally the area was home to the Dena'ina Athabascan, and now
hosts significant numbers from all of the state's indigenous groups.
Economically diverse compared to the rest of the state, the Anchorage
and Mat-Su economy is closely tied to government, oil and gas,
international air cargo, and the visitor industry. Major employment
sectors in the region are heath care and social assistance, retail
trade, and accommodation and food service.9

The Gulf Coast Region, which consists of Kodiak Island, the Kenai
Peninsula, and Prince William Sound, is an economically diverse region
with abundant natural beauty and deep ties to fisheries and the visitor
industry. The predominant Alaska Native cultures are Alutiiq and
Dena'ina Athabascan. The major communities are Kenai, Kodiak, and
Valdez. The Kenai Peninsula is on the road system and connected by the
Alaska Railroad and The Alaska Marine Highway System. Communities in
Prince William Sound are serviced by ports or roads that may be closed
during the winter months, and airports that are used year-round. The
largest employment sectors are health and social assistance, retail
trade, and food manufacturing.10 Southwest Alaska spans some of the
greatest distances in Alaska, ranging from Attu Island in the far west
through the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and onto the Alaska Range in the east.
The Aleutian Islands are serviced by the Alaska Marine Highway System
and the region depends heavily on aviation and maritime transportation.

Southwest Alaska is the traditional home of the Yup'ik people of the
Yukon-Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay regions, as well as the Aleut people of
the Aleutians. Many of the far-flung communities depend on fishing for
subsistence as well as commerce, as the region includes the rich
fisheries of the Bering Sea and Bristol Bay. Outside of the fishing
industry, the region depends heavily on public sector spending to drive
the economy. The largest employment sectors are food manufacturing (fish
processing), retail trade, and transportation and warehousing.11

[[Southeast Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} has the mildest climate in the
state, and is known for its lush temperate rainforest and dependence on
the ocean for transportation and commerce. [The major
[population]{.mark} [centers]{.mark} are [Juneau]{.mark} (also the state
capital), Ketchikan, and Sitka. The region relies heavily on the
[Alaska]{.mark} [Marine Highway System]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as
aviation for transportation, because most of the region is not connected
to the road system. [The predominant Alaska Native cultures are Tlingit,
Haida, and Tsimshian. Fisheries, the visitor industry, and state
government are the major economic drivers]{.underline}. By employment,
the largest sectors are retail trade, heath care and social assistance,
and accommodation and food services.12
