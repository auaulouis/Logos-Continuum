### 1NC---Western Man

#### Western Man defines the telos of modernity's political orientation and its subsequent onto-epistemic registers. This overrepresentation results in a mythological capture of biocentric logics, producing the instrumentality of racialized bodies and the Earth.

**Mbembe 2023** (Achille Mbembe is a Cameroonian historian and political
theorist who is a research professor in history and politics at the Wits

Witwatersrand \"Death Itself\| The Politics of Human Extinction.\" Every

I haven't the space to detail the many critiques of Arendt's central
theses in The Human Condition, particularly since her writing on
plurality is not the location of this chapter but its place of
departure. But one critique is directly related to my argument: the gaps
and frictions in her work concerning identity and difference.38 Earlier,
I suggested that plurality is not extensively theorized in The Human
Condition because it is presented as a matter of fact. Yet the "Man" at
the heart of Arendt's plurality emerges not from a womb but from a
story. As Sylvia Wynter argues in her essay "Unsettling the Coloniality
of Being/Power/ Truth/Freedom," extending a line of anticolonial
thinking with roots in Frantz Fanon and Aimé Césaire, [**"Man" is the
outcome of an effort to present a dominating subset of humanity** as
human being, the unmarked, universal center of Homo sapiens, **the
referent that depends on the exclusion of human Others for its
legibility** and existence]{.underline}.39

[**Man**, in other words, has been the **rhetorical, epistemological,
and ontological accomplishment of white, Western, Enlightenment
elites.**]{.underline} In Wynter's tracing of [Man's historical
emergence under the conditions of theology, colonialism, modernity, and
racism, she offers a powerful reminder that **appeals to species
commonality in Man's name are difficult to unravel from the discourses
of hierarchy and violent forms of domination** and exclusion that gave
him birth]{.underline}. It is a mistake to say, however, that Wynter is
opposed to speaking of humanity as such, or what she calls an
"ecumenical" humanity.40 Rather, [she is opposed to the
overrepresentation of the "West's biocentric Man" in our stories of
human origins and human futures, "the incorporation of all forms of
human being into a single homogenized descriptive statement that is
based on the figure of the **West's liberal monohumanist
Man.**"]{.underline} [The problem with this figure]{.underline},
"[ostensibly natural-scientific]{.underline}," she explains, [is that it
**presumes that the human is** "like all **purely biological species**,
a natural organism,]{.underline} . . . and therefore exists, as such, in
a relationship of pure continuity with all other living beings (rather
than in one of both continuity and discontinuity)."41

**[For those of us not taught to see the other-than-human world as
kin,]{.underline}** it may be difficult to understand the complex moral
bonds and mutual responsibility that are reflected in the Gwitchin
statement. [But **if meaningful political action is to be taken** at
this critical moment, **a different way of thinking is essential.**
Species thinking is a useful tool to imagine how **human and
other-than-human lives, deaths, and futures are intertwined**, and it
serves an important rhetorical role with regard to scholarship,
advocacy, and policy.]{.underline} But species works like any
terministic screen. [By focusing tightly on similarity, species thinking
occludes the differences by which we may identify the working of power:
the fulcrum of both resistance and justice.]{.underline} In contrast,
this chapter has offered [the idea of **bioplurality**, a way of
**thinking** with, within, and **beyond species**, toggling back and
forth between individual and kind, similarity and difference,
connections and distinctions, noting resonances while also listening
carefully for moments of dissonance]{.underline}. By highlighting
similarity, bioplurality avoids the twin traps of humanist and
antihumanist exceptionalism that assume that humans are outside the
living world or that we are somehow exempt from threats to it. **[By
attending to difference, bioplurality marks humanity's unique
culpability for the current crises but also its unequal responsibility
for those crises and their unequal effects.]{.underline}**

### 1NC---Set Col

#### Settler colonialism is an ongoing structure of dispossession and genocide. Settler states sustain their sovereignty through necropolitical governance that exposes racialized populations to "death worlds" while assimilating resistance through symbolic appeals to progress to obscure the intentional architecture of violence. 

**Peacock 25** (Ethan Peacock, Honors Student Majoring in Philosophy

I argue that [**settler-colonialism is not a closed historical event but
a living structure**: a foundational system that continues to shape the
political, legal, and socio-economic conditions of the
contemporary.]{.underline} In the United States, settler-colonialism is
often misrepresented as a "bad chapter" of the nation's history, an
embarrassing but resolved episode overcome by liberal reform. In Canada,
reconciliation efforts have become performative gestures, symbolic
acknowledgments of past harm that leave intact the systems responsible
for ongoing dispossession and oppression. These [narratives]{.underline}
function to [obscure the reality that **settler-colonial power remains
fully operational, embedded in** **the** very **institutions**,
infrastructures, and ideologies **that organize modern
life.**]{.underline} Glen Sean Coulthard's foundational structural
critique that ["**invasion is a structure and not an event**" compels us
to recognize that settler-colonialism is not merely a historical
phenomenon that has concluded; it is an enduring structural condition
that continues to influence the political, legal, and socio-economic
realities of contemporary nation-states.]{.underline}1 I assert that
[**settler-colonialism** persists]{.underline} not only through overt or
visible forms of state violence but also through [a pervasive network of
ideological, economic, and carceral systems that marginalize, exploit,
**dehumanize**, and dispossess **racialized peoples under the guise of
democratic progress, inclusion, and security**. This paradox is
especially striking because **these practices unfold within
self-identified liberal democracies**, where ideals of equality,
justice, and pluralism are professed **even as racialized dispossession
and colonial domination are embedded into their** legal and
**institutional** **architectures.**]{.underline}

**[Settler states]{.underline}** do not **[govern]{.underline}** by
fostering life but [**by managing death and disappearance.** Their power
is enacted not only through spectacular violence but through **routine
legal, economic**, and carceral **systems** that **regulate populations
and secure settler sovereignty.** Prisons, pipelines, borders, and
militarized policing work together to structure dispossession and
marginalization as ordinary. The **rhetoric of** democracy, inclusion,
and **security masks the continued reproduction of racialized** and
colonial **hierarchies.** Settler-colonialism adapts, modernizing its
forms while preserving its core logics.]{.underline} Coulthard's concept
of [the "**politics of recognition**"]{.underline} in Canada [reveals
how **settler states** reproduce the structures of settler-colonial
power by **absorbing resistance through symbolic inclusion while
preserving territorial sovereignty.**]{.underline}2 In Discourse on
Colonialism, Aimé Césaire's analysis of [colonialism as a foundational
infrastructure of capitalism illustrates how dispossession and
racialization remain necessary for maintaining settler
hegemony.]{.underline}3 Angela Davis and Michelle Alexander illustrate
how the prison-industrial complex (PIC) and mass incarceration function
as mechanisms for a carceral arm of racial capitalism designed to
dehumanize, alienate, commodify, and render disposable racialized and
marginalized peoples.4 Achille Mbembe provides the necropolitical
framework to elucidate how [contemporary **sovereignty** is increasingly
**exercised through the strategic exposure of specific populations to
premature death, structural abandonment, and systemic
neglect.**]{.underline} By situating symbolic bureaucratic appeasement,
anti-DEI rhetoric, and the prison-industrial complex (PIC) within the
broader context of settler-colonial capitalism, this research will
demonstrate how [contemporary **governance** is not just about simply
controlling people and power but about **structuring dispossession and
systematizing manufactured precarity.**]{.underline}

This project synthesizes these frameworks with a series of interrelated
case studies: the repression of land defenders at Standing Rock, the
development of militarized police infrastructure like Cop City, the
institutional decay of Mississippi's carceral system, and the Israeli
occupation of Palestine. Each represents a different node in the global
system of settler-colonial violence, technologically sophisticated,
transnationally coordinated, and rhetorically legitimized as progress or
security. While this project draws connections across contexts such as
the United States, Canada, and Israel, it acknowledges that these states
would not self-identify as [settler-colonial regimes]{.underline};
instead, they [justify their actions through the language of national
security, democratic governance, and legal sovereignty.]{.underline}
This interpretive framework is therefore intentionally critical,
foregrounding the structural logics that persist beneath official
narratives. Across these case studies, [settler-colonial states do not
govern by securing life; they govern by manufacturing its
disappearance.]{.underline} Through prisons, pipelines, surveillance
towers, and carceral practices, I contend that [**settler states like**
**the United States**]{.underline}, Canada, and Israel [**sustain
themselves through overlapping mechanisms of symbolic recognition,
capitalist accumulation, and necropolitical governance.** These systems
do not merely fail marginalized populations; they are structured to
oppress and erase them.]{.underline} The prison-industrial complex, the
occupation of Palestine, and the institutional collapse of Parchman
Prison all demonstrate how **[states produce]{.underline}** what Mbembe
calls ["**death worlds**," **zones in which the capacity to live is
degraded by design.**]{.underline}5 [These zones are not accidental;
they are the product of intentional policies, spatial control, and
infrastructural neglect.]{.underline} They are sophisticated expressions
of settler-colonial sovereignty.

[This thesis frames the subterranean as a space that is still in the
making and whose constitution is not yet settled. It views the
activities and products of **geological mapping as generative processes
that enable us to imagine the subterranean**, expand down into it and
draw it up into our surface worlds.]{.underline} As I will show in this
thesis, [**geological maps of the Arctic** today, as nearly 500 years
ago, contain reflections of societal meanings and aspirations of what
could or should become of a place, and resultingly, become a mechanism
to invent and **produce**]{.underline} (**[economic]{.underline}**)
**[spaces.]{.underline}**

[The production and realisation of imagined spaces is crucial to the
curation of socio-political and socio-environmental relations with
place.]{.underline} As political ecologists have noted, [**mapping** has
worked to **rationalise colonial interventions into colonised lands**
and supported the **transformation of lands'** existing ecosystems or
communities **into supporting** more **European, 'rationalised' forms of
spatial production**]{.underline} (c.f. Peluso, 1995; Tsing, 2005).
[**These actions enabled** forestry, mining, military or agricultural
use to become established and allowed **capitalist modes of accumulation
by dispossession to occur**]{.underline} (Harvey, 2003). While volumes
and the subterranean emerge in contemporary geographic literature as
relevant to territorial expansion, the extension of nation-states into
new geological frontiers using geological mapping techniques is
sometimes discussed as if it were a practice of the past, restricted to
early-stage (colonial) politics and histories of territorialisation
(Braun, 2000; Scott, 2008; Himley, 2019; Marston, 2019). However,
[**geological** **mapping**]{.underline}, and indeed mapping of
frontiers, [is **not** something that's **finished.** Geographers have
certainly not exhausted the critical leverage that new perspectives in
territorial politics and materiality offer to understand the meanings
and implications of different cartographies.]{.underline}

Geological mapping is not finished because many places that were
inaccessible 30 or 50 years ago have been brought closer to global
networks of geological knowledge and practice via a combination of
technological advances, changes in land tenure regimes, and climate
change opening up previously ice-covered spaces. Examples of this
include deep sea geologies (Childs, 2020), Antarctic landmasses (Yusoff,
2005) and parts of the Canadian Arctic, as discussed in this thesis.
[Expansion of human knowledge into new geological frontiers is therefore
an ongoing process: geological territorialisation and enrolment into
expansionist imaginations is not over, nor are the practices that enable
this to happen.]{.underline}

[Since geological mapping in 'remote' areas of the Earth]{.underline}
(such as parts of the Canadian Arctic or the sea floor) [draws the
natural environment into closer contact with human interference, **areas
that previously avoided intense industrial activity now stand to be
impacted by it.** As such, there is **increased pressure to** evaluate
not only what 'work' geological knowledge is doing to **rationalise
expansion into new**]{.underline} (subterranean) [**territories**, but
also a need to understand what trade-offs are made during the great
pinching together of surface and subsurface space.]{.underline} After
all, [geological knowledge production and the desire-driven philosophy
of resource extraction occurs against a backdrop of other land use
values and philosophies]{.underline} (Simpson, 2019). Political ecology
is well equipped to untangle what happens when these things meet: where
communities, environment and resources come into contact. However, the
story does not end, nor necessarily begin, there. There is, for example,
a need to understand who is making the knowledge we have about geology
and resources, how this happens and to what effect. How is the practice
of geological knowledge production supporting contemporary regimes and
dreamscapes of state-making, and who benefits and gets left behind in
the process?

#### The alternative is a refusal of the 1AC. We refuse to recognize that which denies indigenous sovereignty as an act of ontological recalibration to expose the contingency and weakness of sovereign power.

Within both critical Black and Indigenous studies, sovereignty has been
a vexed topic. Having defined itself as universal reason and absolute
perspectivity, [sovereignty is the interior humanity against which all
Others are compared and measured]{.underline} (and found wanting).
[Because **violence is the constitutive force of conquest, colonialism,
and slavery**]{.underline}---[and because within classic formulations of
political philosophy, **control over violence defines and legitimizes
the sovereign**]{.underline}---[**sovereignty is grounded within
historical-ideological** and onto-epistemological **phenomena that
benefit its architects and their progeny, producing whiteness**,
maleness, and Europeanness **as the apex of humanity**, the epitome of
transparency, universality, determination, and causality]{.underline}
(Ferreira da Silva 2007, Kauanui 2008, Sturm 2002, Wynter 2003).
[**Sovereignty operates by solidifying boundaries, controlling movement,
demanding a singularity of life** out of a vast multiplicity, and
creating and then **naturalizing hierarchies that function through
dehumanization, dispossession, and exclusion.** These **processes
advance through** the ongoing and simultaneous **recognition and
elimination of Indigenous populations**]{.underline} (Morgensen 2011,
Wolfe 2006), [through the **constitution of Black people as dispossessed
and** therefore **depoliticized subjects**]{.underline} (Spillers 1987),
[and through the standardization of dominant settler reckonings of
time]{.underline} (Bruyneel 2007, Rifkin 2017) [and relationship to
place]{.underline} (Harris 1993). How then can one enact
self-determination when new forms of dispossession are continuously
rewritten over earlier removals and displacements, what Shanya Cordis
(2019) would call the "settler ascription of sovereign in/capacity" (p.
20)?

It is important to remember that **[sovereignty is]{.underline}**, as
Joanne Barker (2005) has argued, "**[historically
contingent]{.underline}**. . .[**embedded within** the specific
**social** **relations** in which it is invoked and given
meaning]{.underline}" (p. 21). [Thus, it is **not unitary** but
instead]{.underline} "**[messy and incomplete]{.underline}**," as Circe
Sturm (2017, p. 343) has argued; relatedly, sovereignty has been
described as interdependent (Cattelino 2008, 2023), nested (Simpson
2014), and entangled (Dennison 2012). It is also important to remember
that [**sovereignty is obsessed with security because its conquest** and
disavowal of interiority **are never seamless** nor complete; it can be,
and often is]{.underline}, "[unhinged]{.underline}" (Thomas & Masco
2023), [**always potentially undone by that which fails to recognize
it**, by **that which refuses it** in intentional and unconscious ways.
Critical scholars within Black studies and Indigenous studies have
encouraged us to look at the question of sovereignty beyond the state
and beyond the parameters of its institutions, positioning it instead as
practices, performances, and processes that refuse law and dominion and
that draw attention to alternative ontological modes of governance,
community, and ceremony.]{.underline} In this way,
[they]{.underline}---like those in the previous section---[challenge
Western parameters of Being and becoming]{.underline} (see also Biehl &
Locke 2017).

Building from her classic articulation of refusal in Mohawk Interruptus,
[Audra Simpson]{.underline} (2014), for example, [has attempted to
distinguish sovereignty as a Western form of exceptionalism and
dominance from "**sovereignty as Indigenous belonging, dignity, and
justice**"]{.underline} (Simpson 2020, p. 686). In the latter context,
[the language of sovereignty has been central to Indigenous claims for
self-governance whether these claims are being presented to other
Indigenous nations, to other governments]{.underline} (such as the
United States or Canada), or to international tribunals. [Sovereignty
matters]{.underline}, therefore, [because it is a way to talk about an
ontology that makes land and water central to personhood, safety, and
integrity. In this **ontological recalibration**]{.underline}, Simpson
argues, [where easy spatial and temporal binaries and **Western
hierarchies** of being are **refused, sovereignty becomes a form of
relationality rather than an instrument of exclusion and violence**, a
logic for reproducing colonial rule through the perpetuation of the
tropes of cultural and temporal difference.]{.underline}

Similarly, Nishnaabeg scholar and writer Leanne Simpson (2017) discusses
[Indigenous governing structures as processual and emergent, a system of
leadership that reflected the local landscape. The idea of nationhood
that emerges from this relationality of context, land, and people
reflects what she calls an "ecology of intimacy"]{.underline} (p. 8),
[one grounded in connection, relationship, reciprocity, respect, and
self-determination]{.underline} (see also Maynard & Simpson 2022). For
Leanne Simpson, and for others, [**sovereignty cannot be rooted in
recognition** by the political formation **of the nation-state** because
it is inherent and unceded]{.underline} (Moreton-Robinson 2007).
Instead, [**sovereignty emerges from** the kind of]{.underline}
"**[grounded normativity]{.underline}**" [that]{.underline} Glen
Coulthard (2014) has argued [**grows through resurgent political** and
cultural **practices.** These are]{.underline} what Laura Harjo (2019)
identifies as "[practices of futurity]{.underline}" (p. 13)---[everyday
**community-based practices through which people recognize their own
power** to act and to self-determine]{.underline}---[practices that
**bring** a]{.underline} "**[radical sovereignty]{.underline}**" **[into
being.]{.underline}** Conscious efforts toward language revitalization
are among the ways to elaborate this kind of sovereignty, one that can
also redound to new forms of economic autonomy (Davis 2018; see also
Cattelino 2008). But so, too, are the kinds of rejections Larry Nesper
(2002) addresses in his account of Ojibwe spearfishers in Wisconsin who
"violated" fishing regulations in their observation of off-reservation
rights that had been guaranteed by nineteenth-century treaties with the
federal government. Other Native North American struggles for dignity,
land, water, and self-preservation---**[refusals of the state's refusal
of Native sovereignty]{.underline}**---[have similarly been
criminalized]{.underline} (Barker 2021), [yet tribes continue to
**challenge** juridical **norms that perpetuate human/nonhuman divides**
through the language of ownership]{.underline} (e.g., Carroll 2015,
Estes 2019, Powell 2018, Todd 2018).

I haven't the space to detail the many critiques of Arendt's central
theses in The Human Condition, particularly since her writing on
plurality is not the location of this chapter but its place of
departure. But one critique is directly related to my argument: the gaps
and frictions in her work concerning identity and difference.38 Earlier,
I suggested that plurality is not extensively theorized in The Human
Condition because it is presented as a matter of fact. Yet the "Man" at
the heart of Arendt's plurality emerges not from a womb but from a
story. As Sylvia Wynter argues in her essay "Unsettling the Coloniality
of Being/Power/ Truth/Freedom," extending a line of anticolonial
thinking with roots in Frantz Fanon and Aimé Césaire, "[Man" is the
outcome of an effort to present a dominating subset of humanity as human
being, the unmarked, universal center of Homo sapiens, the referent that
depends on the exclusion of human Others for its legibility and
existence]{.underline}.39

[Man, in other words, has been the rhetorical, epistemological, and
ontological accomplishment of white, Western, Enlightenment
elites]{.underline}. In Wynter's tracing of [Man's historical emergence
under the conditions of theology, colonialism, modernity, and racism,
she offers a powerful reminder that appeals to species commonality in
Man's name are difficult to unravel from the discourses of hierarchy and
violent forms of domination and exclusion that gave him
birth]{.underline}. It is a mistake to say, however, that Wynter is
opposed to speaking of humanity as such, or what she calls an
"ecumenical" humanity.40 Rather, [she is opposed to the
overrepresentation of the "West's biocentric Man" in our stories of
human origins and human futures, "the incorporation of all forms of
human being into a single homogenized descriptive statement that is
based on the figure of the West's liberal monohumanist
Man."]{.underline} [The problem with this figure]{.underline},
"[ostensibly natural-scientific]{.underline}," she explains, [is that it
presumes that the human is "like all purely biological species, a
natural organism,]{.underline} . . . and therefore exists, as such, in a
relationship of pure continuity with all other living beings (rather
than in one of both continuity and discontinuity)."41

and the island was then used for subsistence. In 1942, during World War
II, the Adak Army Airfield was established for defensive action against
Japanese forces occupying Attu and Kiska. In 1945 the facilities were
transferred to Alaskan Air Command and then transferred again to the
U.S. Navy in 1950 until the facility was closed on March 31, 1997,
through the Base Realignment and Closure Program of 1995.

On March 17, 2004, [**Aleut received** 47,150 acres]{.underline} (about
twice the area of Manhattan) [of land and many repurposed **facilities
on Adak Island as the result of a Land Transfer Agreement with the
United States Government** facilitated by the Department of the Interior
under public Law Order 7609.]{.underline}

### L---Carbon Removal

How [environmental racism intersects with carbon removal]{.underline} is
crucial to understand and address. [However, the issue
isn't]{.underline} just [about disproportionately shared impacts or
benefits]{.underline} --- [which policy discussions]{.underline} in the
US are starting to [deal with]{.underline} more explicitly --- [but the
way that production of difference is central to the accumulation of
capital.]{.underline} These differences are perpetuated when carbon
removal technologies serve to extend prevailing fossil-based
accumulation regimes, a concern commonly known as mitigation deterrence.
In carbon removal policy discussions, it has become standard to mention
the danger of mitigation deterrence, which leads to suggestions of
policy remedies like separate targets. There are also discussions of
environmental justice, which lead to conversations on topics like
community engagement or cumulative burden assessment. Yet by the time
these concepts are addressed by companies and governments, environmental
racism is rarely directly mentioned. Scholarship can help make the link
here, and yet most articles on mitigation deterrence do not explicitly
address race either.

Here, some definition of terms will be useful for readers from multiple
disciplinary backgrounds:

• Mitigation deterrence is "the prospect of reduced or delayed
mitigation resulting from the introduction or consideration of another
climate intervention" (Markusson et al., 2018).

• Capitalism is a system in which private actors own the means of
producing goods, and extract profit from workers who are paid wages for
their labor. Following Nancy Fraser, we view capitalism not as a mere
economic system but as an institutionalized societal order, like
feudalism, which relies on structural divisions and institutional
separations (Fraser, 2022).

• Racism is not a collection of individual or intentional acts, but a
structural phenomenon, in which differentiation of people is core.
Racism is "the state-sanctioned or extra-legal production and
exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death,"
as defined by Ruth Wilson Gilmore (Gilmore, 2007).

Racial capitalism, then, is a concept that examines how capitalism
relies on this production of difference. In this paper, we focus on
race, but the line of critique could be broadened to other differences
like gender or class. "Racial capitalism captures the sense that
actually existing capitalism exploits \[people\] through culturally and
socially constructed differences such as race, gender, region and
nationality and is lived through those uneven formations", writes Lisa
Lowe, quoted by Laura Pulido (Lowe, 2015; Pulido, 2016). Racial
capitalism is a concept whose origins lie with the intellectuals writing
about apartheid in the 1970s; it was popularized more recently in Cedric
Robinson's writing about the emergence of the black radical tradition,
and is now used in multiple fields --- with a core meaning that racism
and racial inequality and capitalism are deeply connected (Go, 2021).
Robinson saw capitalism emerging from the feudal order; it was racial
because racialism was already a part of European feudal society (Kelley,
2017, Taíw´ o\` and Bright, 2020). "Capitalism arose under a racist
European feudal system. It used "race" as a form of rule -- to
subordinate, to kill, and to enslave others -- and used that difference
for profit-making" (Estes, 2019, p. 28). Of course, this is not only a
historical system, but a present reality ---one that new technologies
and approaches like carbon removal evolve within. As one example of how
racial capitalism functions, Indigenous scholar and writer Nick Estes
points to how billionaire media tycoon Ted Turner owns more than 2
million acres of ranch land across the globe and more than 200,000 acres
of Oceti Sakowin treaty land in western South Dakota; i.e., a single
white man owns more wealth and land than entire Indigenous nations.

Racial capitalism is an important concept to understand for people
thinking about carbon removal. When we live in a society with not just
capitalism, but racial capitalism, [the default implementations of new
technologies and practices will be racialized]{.underline}. Here, we
follow the example of Laura Pulido's analysis of Flint, Michigan, in
which she illustrates that the catastrophe of the lead in Flint's water
supply cannot be explained by a nonracial material analysis, nor by
racism alone (Pulido, 2016). Racism made it possible to consider the
people in Flint disposable; the globalization of capital, the
deindustrialization of Flint, and austerity politics by the neoliberal
fiscal manager, appointed by the governor to replace elected officials
and return the city to fiscal solvency, also contributed to the
poisoning, as Pulido illustrates. Similarly, [damages from the
implementation of carbon removal under the status quo]{.underline} ---
[disenfranchised Black communities in the US suffering for UK climate
goals]{.underline}, in the case of Drax --- aren't explainable simply by
racism or capitalism alone. We have to understand the way in which
capitalism exploits difference in order to see what is going on and
address it.

It is becoming more common (at least in advocacy if not in scholarship)
to describe how [CDR infrastructures, impacts, and financial flows that
arise within a condition of structural racism]{.underline} are going to
[tend towards harmful projects --- this is important]{.underline}
analysis, [but]{.underline} it [only describes part of the problem. If
we see the problem that way, as the US state currently does, the
remedies]{.underline} might [look like]{.underline} something like
Justice40 ([a Biden]{.underline} Administration [Executive Order that
proscribes]{.underline} that 40 % of [the benefits from clean energy
investments flow to disadvantaged communities]{.underline}).
[Or]{.underline} it might look like New York State's recent legislation
[stipulating that projects]{.underline} with environmental impact [need
to do cumulative impacts analysis to receive environmental
permits]{.underline} --- an analysis of not just the impacts from the
proposed project, but an analysis that takes into account the existing
harms from other established activities. These are good steps, in that
they deal explicitly with recognizing disproportionate benefits, and
past and existing burdens. [But they don't fully get to the
ways]{.underline} in which [racial capitalism is producing these
differences, not just exploiting them. Nor do these steps
meet]{.underline} some of the [deeper concerns]{.underline} that
environmental and climate justice advocates have [around the overall
speed and trajectories of the energy transition, particularly around a
transition that allows fossil fuel companies and other polluters to
continue to profit.]{.underline} In other words, [analyses of
"responsible" or "harmful" CDR]{.underline} that focus only on
structural racism will [only take us partway towards understanding the
problems with carbon removal under business-as-usual sociopolitical
conditions.]{.underline}

In this short communication, we wish to make the specific point that
racial capitalism has direct implications for mitigation deterrence.
[Mitigation deterrence]{.underline} can [arise from CDR precisely
because the carbon sequestered by removal methods is being made to seem
equivalent to other carbon emitted]{.underline} (McLaren, 2016), [in
spite of many important differences in terms of origin]{.underline}
(fossil fuels, land use change etc.), [timing and geography]{.underline}
(Carton et al., 2021). Also, [the promise of carbon removal]{.underline}
can [lead to over-optimistic reliance on it]{.underline} (in good faith,
or not), and [carbon removal may fail to materialize or cause indirect
increase in emissions]{.underline}, all of [which would undermine
effective equivalence]{.underline}, and so substitution of CDR for
emissions reductions (McLaren, 2020).

Such equivalence is central to carbon budget science, and essential for
the notion of 'net zero' that is the lynchpin for how climate policy is
presented today. Equivalence is also [required for any offsetting of
hard to-abate emissions with CDR, whether through
commercial]{.underline} offsetting schemes [or]{.underline} the
[market-based policy instruments]{.underline} that are so strongly
favored in the current capitalist society.

However, it's not just that mitigation deterrence emerges because fossil
fuel capitalism has a financial interest in delaying mitigation --- it's
not only a product of capitalism, nor of conceptual accounting
practices, as described above. Race, gender, and class are a
constitutive part of how mitigation deterrence emerges.

In what follows, we clarify some of the ways in which not just racism or
capitalism but racial capitalism intersects with mitigation deterrence.
We distinguish between two main dynamics. In the first part of this
commentary, we look at how racial capitalism helps create the conditions
for mitigation deterrence. In the second, we look at how mitigation
deterrence in turn goes on to reproduce structural racism. This short
perspective piece is not intended to as "fill" the gap that we identify,
as deeper co-produced research would be needed to really understand how
race interacts with mitigation deterrence. Neither is this piece
"opening a conversation", given that environmental justice advocates
have been identifying concerns about CDR, environmental racism, and the
prospect of delayed mitigation for some years now. Nor is this the first
paper to discuss race in conjunction with CDR (for example, Batres et
al., 2021). However, the specific literature on mitigation deterrence
has not engaged much with race, and the way it has conceptualized
capitalism has not been explicit about how it produces and thrives on
difference between groups (see for example Markusson et al., 2018;
Markusson et al., 2022). For example, a Web of Science query found 34
papers on "mitigation deterrence", but none for "mitigation
deterrence" + race or racism; similarly, there are 36 papers found with
"moral hazard" + carbon removal, but none of those discuss race or
racism either. We argue that this is a problematic omission that
warrants more attention from scholars in this field.

We have been reflecting on this gap in the literature as guest editors
of this special issue on mitigation deterrence and carbon removal. We
wish to highlight our positionality: we are white scholars in the global
North, and do not have specific expertise on race. However, we wanted to
write this commentary because we saw this lack in the collection that we
were in charge of curating, and we also think it our responsibility to
reflect on why this gap exists and what it means for research on this
topic.

What we want to do here is both acknowledge the gap in the scholarly
literature, and to write down clearly and accessibly how race connects
to mitigation deterrence from carbon removal in a way that makes sense
--- not just to scholars, but also to policymakers and companies working
in this space. We have interacted with companies who hear statements
from civil society organizations like "CDR is environmental racism," and
they feel bewildered about how their engineered pilot project or
demonstration facility could be racist (as racism is still often
understood by many non-academics as a matter of individual intentional
acts, rather than as a structural force). We hope that social science
can play something of a translational role to help developers and
researchers consider the broader social context of their work. We want
to do this in a manner that is self-reflective about the act of research
and scholarship, and its contributions and limitations.

The paper draws on cases of racial environmental injustice from mainly
the US, where they are most extensively documented, whilst the
literature on mitigation deterrence stems from Northern Europe. This
geographical disparity may go some way towards explaining the disconnect
between the two literatures that we seek to address here.

2\. How mitigation deterrence is enabled by racial capitalism

There are at least two ways in which [mitigation deterrence is enabled
by racial capitalism]{.underline}. The first involves [global erasures
in modelling and discourse]{.underline} that [contribute to mitigation
deterrence. IPCC models]{.underline} that [substitute carbon removal for
emission reductions]{.underline} do so [because they prioritize the most
cost-effective mitigation options]{.underline} (Emmerling et al., 2019).
[Yet differences in the costs of mitigation]{.underline} around the
world are not accidental -- they at least partly [reflect structural
inequalities and unequal power relations between North and South, and
derive from the injustices of]{.underline} [historical and present
exploitation]{.underline}. By conflating such issues with the seemingly
neutral category of costs, the [models normalize and
ultimately]{.underline} help [reproduce these conditions]{.underline}
(Kanitkar et al., 2024). In an analysis of integrated assessment
modelling scenarios, Kantikar and colleagues for example found that
"across all scenarios, the current global inequalities in incomes,
energy use, and emissions, are projected to continue even in 2050.
Scenarios also project higher per capita fossil fuel use and lower
carbon dioxide removal in developed countries in 2050 compared to
developing countries" (Kanitkar et al., 2024). CDR is assumed to be
available in marginalized and Black communities because global
historical injustices that these groups were exposed to are projected to
continue.

[Erasures happen with both technological and "nature-based" carbon
removal, in]{.underline} different ways. With engineered removals,
[choosing]{.underline} sites in [locations like the US Gulf South for
first-of-a-kind projects]{.underline} risks failing to recognize the
communities who have [and]{.underline} are disproportionately
experiencing harms from fossil fuel and petrochemical production. This
lack of recognition may also happen when it comes to [engineered carbon
removals that would utilize Indigenous lands]{.underline}; for example,
in Canada, one analysis indicated that there is little evidence of
Indigenous engagement in direct air capture and storage, even though
storage activities occur in areas that are subject to Aboriginal and
Treaty rights (Cortinovis et al., 2024).

When it comes to nature-based removals, [studies that identify
"available" locations for]{.underline} land-based [carbon
sequestration]{.underline} (Griscom et al., 2017; Bastin et al., 2019;
Pozo et al., 2020) [find large potentials in]{.underline} poor nations
of [the global South and, in the process, erase the practices and
existence of pastoralists and Indigenous peoples]{.underline} who are
using that land (Bluwstein and Cavanagh, 2023). In other words, the way
of seeing that turns land and ecosystems into carbon is racialised.
Baldwin explains how deterritorialising the boreal forest as a space of
carbon operates as a "disciplinary schema" that consolidates an idea of
"white" national subjectivity (Baldwin, 2009). [This enacts a geography
of racial difference that constitutes epistemic violence, that is, the
erasure or marginalization of other ways of seeing and knowing the
world. The "invisibility" of racialized groups]{.underline} that live on
the land is part of what [enables]{.underline} the [land to be
considered]{.underline} as [a carbon removal resource, and]{.underline}
that imagined availability --- [calculations of]{.underline} the
potential of carbon removal --- can [result in projections of an
unrealistically large carbon removal potential]{.underline} (Dooley et
al., 2022). Over-reliance on [potential future carbon
removal]{.underline} is in turn likely to [deter current efforts to
reduce emissions]{.underline}.

There are ways to guard against these erasures. There are some examples
of researchers grappling with how to do technical assessment of carbon
removal that considers race and addresses erasures--- for example, the
recent analysis of carbon removal potential in the US by several
national laboratories, Roads to Removal, is spatially explicit to the
county level and includes mapping of Black-owned farms. As the report
states, "Historically the US agricultural industry was built on
injustice and inequity, including relying on enslaved farmworkers; white
theft of land owned by indigenous, Black, and other people of color; and
bank and crop-insurance discrimination against Black, indigenous, and
farmers of color... These historic and ongoing injustices have resulted
in an agricultural industry composed of more than 95 % white (and
majority male) land owners and 86 % white land renters" (Pett-Ridge et
al., 2023). The report uses county-level data to map the acres of
agricultural land operated with non-white farmers as a recommendation to
target equity-based outreach to farmers, and the report also maps
non-white and Tribal woodland areas, grounding the problem of forest
carbon loss in context, explaining that historic forest loss happened
due to settler colonial expansion that "violently separated Indigenous
communities from the forests they stewarded." Along with discussions of
Indigenous cultural fire practices and current Indigenous forest
stewardship, this sets up the report to identify both potential
synergies and conflicts between Indigenous forest management and
forest-based carbon removal. This not to say the report is perfect, but
it was not always the case that technical government-funded reports
could talk about theft of land --- there is an opportunity here for
social scientists to collaborate with modelers and continue the
conversation about how to do this work. Of course, there is a difference
between emerging best practices in the public sector, and what global
companies will likely default to as the industry grows. Until better
modelling practices are fully institutionalized around the world and
also used by private actors, the (racialized) mitigation deterrence risk
remains.

A second way that [racial capitalism enables mitigation
deterrence]{.underline} is [through racialized labor formations. Common
assumptions]{.underline} of the cost of [carbon removal also contain
assumptions about labour]{.underline} costs, [and these]{.underline}
assumptions [have racial implications.]{.underline} For example,
[inexpensive carbon removal]{.underline} may [hinge on]{.underline}
being able to do it in [places where wages are cheaper]{.underline}.
Take [for example]{.underline} the seaweed industry: it is difficult to
scale up a seaweed industry in the global North due to labor costs
compared with the established seaweed industry in [Indonesia and
China]{.underline}. Seaweed sinking as a carbon removal approach, should
it be effective, may face similar economic dynamics. Likewise, tree
planting might appear economical in places such as [sub-Saharan
Africa]{.underline} because of low-paid labour.

There is a whole line of scholarship on the "Plantationocene",
describing alienation of land and labor and the long-distance
simplification of landscapes, with the plantation as a race-based social
system embodying both racial violence and resistance. This scholarship
argues [the Plantationocene]{.underline} is a more accurate term than
the Anthropocene to describe an era that was [characterized by
Indigenous dispossession of lands, settler colonialism, slavery, and
racialized distribution of environmental change]{.underline} (Wolford,
2021). Although not without its own issues,1 this lens [helps us
see]{.underline} which [racialized labor formations will likely emerge
in a CDR industry that relies on]{.underline} large-scale, standardized
land management to remove carbon. Even though soil carbon, enhanced
weathering, afforestation, or biomass companies may be possible through
visions of small or community-scale carbon removal, the [market
imperatives to deliver carbon removal cheaply]{.underline} [and with
standardized measurement]{.underline} complicate alternative
formulations of it.

If fair wages were priced into labour-intensive forms of removal, then
maybe mitigation would be cheaper than CDR at least in certain sectors.
This is understudied but should be a subject of research. To enable such
studies, it is crucial that models become more transparent about the
kinds of assumptions, e.g. costs of labour and land, that go into the
modelling of CDR.

Finally, [mitigation deterrence might arise through the lack of
representation in defining, articulating, and projecting
CDR]{.underline}. Certainly, one might go to a CDR event and see women
and people of color, and all-male panels are becoming rare. There are
some women and people of color founders, and many people working on
policy, research, and finance. Yet in respect to where funding comes
from (and returns to) --- it appears that [climate tech]{.underline} so
far [remains disproportionately white, male, and global North
dominated.]{.underline} This leads to a situation where women take
enabling roles while male executives and investors are set up to profit
from the industry's development. The question of representation also
arises when [CDR policy favors incumbent industries, players, or methods
tied to legacy interests]{.underline}, rather than some of these nascent
startups. [Social difference ends up being reproduced in]{.underline}
many of [these scenarios]{.underline}. Again, we are not aware of
research exploring these issues at the moment, yet it is clear that they
raise important questions for mitigation deterrence scholarship. Could
[a lack of representation lead to overconfidence in the possibilities of
carbon removal, and a blindness to negative impacts]{.underline}? Does
[the dominance of (white, male, global North dominated) science,
technology and engineering]{.underline} and the underfunding of social
dimensions or sustainability systems research [lead to framings like
"the need for 10 Gt", and the blindness to]{.underline} some of the
[on-the-ground challenges]{.underline} of implementing new
land-intensive practices, in ways that deter emissions reductions?

3\. How mitigation deterrence in turn also perpetuates racial capitalism

Racial capitalism enables mitigation deterrence, but it is also the case
that mitigation deterrence feeds back and helps perpetuate racial
capitalism. The idea of [compensating]{.underline} for [ongoing
emissions with removals on the open market furthers environmental
racism, by enabling unspecified ongoing emissions to be compensated by
whomever is able to pay]{.underline} --- especially in the absence of a
framework specifying how to allocate residual emissions.

Environmental justice scholars and activists have for decades
demonstrated the racialized politics behind the siting of industrial
plants (Taylor, 2014; Greenpeace, 2022; Roy, 2020). It is well
documented that the burdens of pollution fall disproportionately on
communities of color within countries like the US, and also globally
(see e.g. (Liu et al., 2021). But scholars of race and environmental
justice such as John D. Marquez ´ have also pointed out the ways in
which this society constructs people of color as expendable (Marquez, ´
2014) --- not just in localized "sacrifice zones", but in entire
populations (Pellow, 2017).

[It is because of]{.underline} the [systemic devaluation]{.underline} of
BIPOC lives --- and the correspondent siting of industrial facilities
--- [that society is able to entertain]{.underline} the idea of
[compensating for industrial fossil fuel emissions]{.underline}, or
luxury emissions like those of business class-air travel that
disproportionately are created by and benefit rich, upper class White
men --- [with carbon removals. Such practices make it possible for
polluting refineries]{.underline} that produce jet fuel, likely to be
[sited in a community of color, to keep on running]{.underline}. It is
one of the reasons why communities of color already overburdened by
pollution from the petrochemical industry in places such as Southwestern
Louisiana and Texas are concerned that siting [direct air capture hubs
there will worsen environmental risks and burdens]{.underline}. Among
their concerns are the [risks that derive from new CO2 transport
infrastructure, as well as the possibility of extending the life
of]{.underline} polluting [fossil fuelled industrial
facilities]{.underline} (Scott-Buechler et al., 2023). While in theory
the risks from new infrastructure are manageable with proper regulation,
these communities have a history of experiencing improper regulation and
lax enforcement at state and federal levels. If direct air capture
projects either add to the cumulative burden or keep polluting
facilities operational, then [BIPOC communities would again be
sacrificed]{.underline} --- [this time to]{.underline} national,
foreign, or corporate [decarbonization goals.]{.underline}

Of course, most carbon removal project proponents and companies would
say that is not the idea behind their work. They would also say that
they intend to build good projects with the best available control
technologies for any non-CO2 emissions. Yet [if carbon removal policy
allows for the continued operation of industrial facilities]{.underline}
that are disproportionately sited [in communities of color]{.underline}
--- [and]{.underline} if [companies are allowed]{.underline} [to
counterbalance]{.underline} their [emissions with removals]{.underline},
rather than decarbonizing their processes while upgrading to the latest
pollution control technologies --- [then it is complicit in
racism]{.underline}. The lack of policy to avoid such situations is
tantamount to silently endorsing them. (Notably, mitigation policy that
leads to the closure of industrial facilities in rich countries while
offshoring that pollution to other countries can also be an expression
of racism.)

[Black, Indigenous, people]{.underline} of colour, women, and low-income
people are underrepresented in the institutions making decisions about
carbon removal and profiting from those decisions, and they are doubly
and [disproportionately impacted by mitigation deterrence]{.underline}
dynamics. Doubly because these groups bear the brunt of the negative
impacts of both CDR initiatives [and]{.underline} the activities that
remain unabated owing to mitigation deterrence dynamics. If we also add
[climate change impacts]{.underline}, then they [might be triply
impacted, especially if carbon removal]{.underline} is first relied on
but then [fails to live up to its climate-altering promise.]{.underline}

### L---Care

#### The 1AC utilizes care to govern indigenous life through false promises of hope while simultaneously rendering them disposable and thus open to death.

Rovaniemi, Finland; 10/2/22 "Biopolitics" published in "Critical Studies

Biopolitics of the Arctic

The study of biopolitics in the Arctic is relatively under-developed
when we compare it with the study of geopolitics. We know much by now
about the Arctic as a space of geopolitical contestation between
powerful territorially aggrandizing states (Tamnes & Offerdal, 2014). We
know much less about [the **Arctic** as a space of]{.underline}
specifically **[biopolitical governance]{.underline}**, a space, that
is, [in which **power** is **exercised** over human populations
**through** strategies of **care** for life.]{.underline} The need for
such understanding and analysis is all the greater in this present era
of pandemics and the threat of disease, which is to say, of biological
death, of suffering and of loss and illness, in the Arctic as much as
elsewhere.

However, there are examples of research in which the concept of
biopolitics has been deployed to make sense of how power is organized
and exercised in the Arctic. The anthropologist Lisa Stevenson has
written especially important works in which she has developed the
concept as a framework for understanding power relations between the
Canadian state and the Inuit who live in Arctic Canada (Stevenson,
2012). Rather than try to provide a broad survey of different texts in
which the concept of biopolitics has been deployed to approach power in
the Arctic, this chapter will focus specifically on Stevenson's work, as
an important and thorough example of scholarship on Arctic biopolitics.
It is a text which does not simply add or transfer biopolitics to Arctic
Studies from other areas of research, but which, in examining the
Arctic, contributes significantly to the fundamental theory and
understanding of the importance of biopolitics for knowledge. Yet it
also has limits, owing to its relative age and to its disciplinary
origins in anthropology; these require us to think beyond it, using
recent insights into the changing nature of biopolitics, drawn from
International Relations and elsewhere.

As Stevenson argues, one of the major utilities of the concept of
biopolitics for the study of power in the Arctic is the way in which it
enables us to reveal and see the violence of discourses and practices of
care in the Arctic. [The **biopolitics of care**]{.underline} is by now
a very wide subject area transcending disciplines and geographic areas
of study (De Boever, 2013). It is for obvious reasons a major feature of
critical humanitarian studies, as theorists and practitioners have
learnt to be more circumspect about the relations between humanitarian
care and power (Mavelli, 2017). We know well by now that the concept and
practice of care is deeply loaded, politically. Stevenson's study of the
Inuit experience of care in the Canadian Arctic is yet another
contribution to the wider understanding of how [**care**
functions]{.underline}, [in the Arctic]{.underline}, as well as many
other spaces of liberal intervention, [to **legitimate
intervention**]{.underline} itself (Reid, 2005).

One of the main ways in which [**Inuit** have **suffered from** the
**care** of the Canadian state]{.underline} has been [through the
intervention in the suicide crisis said to exist in Inuit communities.
The suicide crisis]{.underline} among the Inuit, [as well as the wider
**health problems** identified with Inuit communities, has been useful
to the Canadian state when it comes to **legitimating interventions** in
Inuit communities]{.underline}. It is not that the biopolitical state
does not care; it does. The point is, as Stevenson well argues, that [it
is useful for the state to care where **care legitimates** its
capacities to intervene and ensure its own **colonial control** of
spaces and peoples]{.underline}, including the Inuit.

Suicide crises in the Arctic are not limited to Inuit communities, and
the analysis of the biopolitical functions of these crises in
legitimating colonial interventions in populations and territories could
easily be extended to encompass other peoples and places. The 'increased
risk' of suicide among Saami populations has, for example, been
extensively researched, with particular attention drawn to the high
rates of suicide among young Saami men (Silviken et al., 2006). These
elevated rates are reported as being especially high among
reindeer-herding men, and higher still among young men (Sjolander,
2011). Attempts are ongoing to increase awareness and refine the means
by which the suicide crisis in Saami communities is addressed. A recent
study identified 17 different suicide prevention initiatives targeting
Saami in Norway, Sweden and Finland, as well as 40 different
problematizations regarding the question of how to prevent suicide among
Saami (Stoor et al., 2021). Typically, such **[studies]{.underline}**
are statistical and **[make]{.underline}** their own **[biopolitical
assumption]{.underline}** that suicide is a 'problem' and an [expression
of]{.underline} '[unfavourable]{.underline} psychosocial
[outcomes]{.underline}' [which require preventing]{.underline}
(Kiaerbech et al., 2021). In other areas of the Arctic, as diverse as
Alaska and the northern regions of Russia, and in the analysis of other
indigenous groups, the same [positivist approaches prevail, under the
guise of]{.underline} '[prevention science]{.underline}' (Allen et al.,
2022) [and]{.underline} '[targeted prevention]{.underline}' (Sumarokov
et al., 2014). **[Increasing]{.underline}** the efficacy of
**[interventions]{.underline}** is seen to [go hand in hand
**with**]{.underline} the need for [**increasingly refined**
quantitative **studies** of the whys and wherefores of
indigenous]{.underline} '[mental health]{.underline}' (Middleton et al.,
2021). Of all the different suicide crises researched in the Arctic it
is that of the Inuit that has drawn most attention for the high rates of
suicide, ones regularly detailed as being among the highest in the world
(Kral, 2016). Mean agestandardized analyses of different suicide rates
in the eight different Arctic states indicate that the three Arctic
regions with the very highest rates are Chukotka, Nunavut and Greenland,
all of which contain large indigenous populations (Kue-Young et al.,
2015). Statistical analyses, however, remain limited in their different
conclusions, partly because not all Arctic states record ethnic identity
in their health databases (Kue-Young et al., 2015). Nevertheless, [the
rising interest in documenting and detailing the rates and risks of
suicide in Arctic regions can be seen to have developed in parallel with
the scaling up of mental health care as a]{.underline} '[core
service]{.underline}' [of state **health agencies** as well as
non-governmental agencies **governing indigeneity in the Arctic** as a
whole]{.underline} (Trout & Wexler, 2020).

Thinking about the biopolitics of care is also fundamental to the work
of two other scholars of the Arctic---Marjo Lindroth and Heidi
SinevaaraNiskanen---whose work addresses it as a central theme (Lindroth
& Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2018, 2022). The focus of their research has been
on the continuities of colonialism at work in the policies of Arctic
states such as Canada, as well as the Arctic Council. This is important
because the Arctic Council is often identified as a more progressive and
postcolonial regime of governance when compared with the Arctic states.
As Lindroth and Sinevaara-Niskanen describe, the significance of the
Arctic Council is that it functions to represent a structural
transformation in the relations of states to indigenous peoples, on
account of its being more inclusive and consultative of indigenous
peoples than the states of the Arctic region (Lindroth &
Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022: 16). Whether we are considering the care of
the Arctic Council or of Arctic states for indigenous peoples, [it is
essential]{.underline}, they argue, [that we see how such **care
functions strategically**]{.underline}, as a way of signalling to
indigenous peoples and the wider world that things are getting better.
[Care]{.underline}, they suggest, '[**signals hope** for the
better]{.underline}' [yet, on closer inspection, is **revealed to
be**]{.underline} '**[dangerous]{.underline}**' [and]{.underline} indeed
'**[colonial]{.underline}**' (Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022: 101).
**[Hope]{.underline}** itself has to be understood [as another element
of]{.underline} such **[colonialism]{.underline}**, they argue, for
[acts of care are designed to]{.underline} '[reproduce
hope]{.underline}' (Lindroth & SinevaaraNiskanen, 2022: 101).
[Expressions of a will to **care** **enable** Arctic regimes to
implement a]{.underline} '**[politics of hope]{.underline}**'
[which]{.underline}, in turn, [**extends** their **colonial rule** over
indigenous peoples]{.underline} (Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022:
101). As Claes Tängh Wrangel has well argued, [**hope**, like care, is a
**biopolitical technology**]{.underline} (Tängh Wrangel, 2019: 669);
[its function is to **enable regimes** of power **to govern** the
**life** of the populations which they target, and
**produce**]{.underline} '**[hopeful subjects]{.underline}**' [whose
**orientation** to the future is **secure** and **not** **dangerous to
political power**. **Subjects without hope**, it is **feared** in the
United States]{.underline}, for example, [are more likely to turn into
suicide bombers]{.underline} (Tängh Wrangel, 2019: 672). [In the Arctic,
there is a comparable set of linkages between care, hope and suicide
that are equally biopolitical]{.underline}. The Arctic Council has been
particularly proactive in tackling the suicide crisis in the Arctic, not
just among the Inuit but among wider indigenous communities as well. It
is essential therefore that the Council's policies towards suicide be
subjected to the same kind of biopolitical scrutiny that Stevenson has
given to those of the Canadian state.

Refusing Care

Understanding the biopolitical rationalities which shape the discourses
and practices of care in the Arctic also enables us to better understand
the rationalities of those who resist that care in the Arctic. It is a
fact that [while care continues to be exercised towards **indigenous
peoples** of the Arctic]{.underline}, [by Arctic states]{.underline} as
much as by the Arctic Council, [and while some representatives of those
peoples cooperate with these colonial bodies, others among these peoples
resist and **refuse** that **care**. The reason for that resistance and
**refusal** owes **to** the ways in which **care** is sometimes
experienced **as** **murderous**]{.underline} (Stevenson, 2014: 4).
Stevenson's [focus on the **disjuncture between** the **intention**
of]{.underline} the [care]{.underline} of Canada **[and]{.underline}**
the [Inuit **experience** of that care as murderous]{.underline} leads
her to ask what it is that goes on in this disjuncture between the
intention to care for life and the experience of that care as murderous.
Is there something in Inuit subjectivity that produces the anger of the
rejection of that care, a rejection which has, as she also well details,
produced a suicide epidemic in Nunavut in which the suicide rate for the
region is more than five times the Canadian national average (Stevenson,
2014: 7). What is it in the Inuit, as a subjectformation, as well as a
culture and people, and as a political subject, that produces this
apparent desire for death? Is there something in biopolitics and the
experience of the caring embrace of biopower that leads the Inuit to
reject it and choose death? These are questions which are not specific
to the study of the Arctic, or of indigenous peoples elsewhere. However,
they are key to the ways in which the concept of biopolitics has been
mobilized within Arctic research to date.

Answering these questions requires us to navigate the colonial origins
and development of biopower. Among the Inuit, [the experience of
biopolitics has been translated through the practices by which Canada
responded to the tuberculosis crisis]{.underline} of the 1950s and
1960s: [many **Inuit** were **forcibly** **removed** from their homes
and communities in the Arctic and shipped to sanitoria in the south of
the country, where they were **treated**, often **only to die without**
ever **seeing** their **homes** and families **again**.]{.underline} The
[inhumanity of]{.underline} those **[biopolitical
practices]{.underline}**, not just the force with which Inuit were
removed, but the ways in which their **[lives]{.underline}** were
**[reduced to statistical series]{.underline}**---[numbers and not
names]{.underline}---and to [diseased bodies to be treated and not
psyches with dreams and desires of their own]{.underline}, may help us
to understand their resistance and refusal. These biopolitical
techniques were effectively drawn, as Stevenson argues, from the realms
of animal husbandry (Stevenson 2014: 29). [The death of a tubercular
Inuit was often anonymous, leaving no trace in]{.underline} Canadian
state [records other than a simple index card, marked with the statement
'dead' and with the year of death enumerated]{.underline}---'1956' in
the case of one Inuit, Kaujak, whose journey to death Stevenson's
research attempts to unearth more details about (Stevenson, 2014:
21--46).

Superficial critics of Foucault's theory of biopolitics have often
pointed out that it is marked by an absence of an analysis of
colonialism. The argument goes that Foucault was a Eurocentric thinker
with little regard for the non-European world, and that his theory is,
in fact, as Howell and Richter-Montpetit argue, racist (Howell &
Richter-Montpetit, 2019: 2). Research on biopolitics, which uses the
concept to help us understand how care functions in the strategies of
colonial powers, is, therefore, truly important in overcoming this
analytical deficit of Foucault's. In the Arctic, at least, the
biopolitical emphasis of state power on caring for and preserving life
can be seen to be a fundamentally 'colonial norm' (Stevenson, 2014: 96).

Looking at practices of care through a biopolitical lens in these ways
is really to pose a challenge to the ever-larger literatures in the
health sciences that continue to treat care as if it were sheer
benevolence. [Identifying suicide simply as a problem to be solved and
enacting]{.underline} '[suicide prevention interventions]{.underline}'
[as the solution]{.underline}, as has been done by the Arctic Council
through its Rising Sun initiative since 2015 (Collins et al., 2019:
152), [may only reproduce the kinds of problems which earlier
interventions in indigenous communities are known for, namely the
experience of colonialism. Scientific studies]{.underline} which [argue
for **state-led** **interventions** **into communities** **where** the
act of **suicide is itself an indigenous solution to** the problem of
**colonial intervention** **do not**]{.underline} seem to [**see** the
**irony** and paradoxicality of their reasoning]{.underline} (Pollock et
al., 2020). [A **biopolitical analytic**]{.underline} can help in at
least **[making]{.underline}** such **[paradoxes]{.underline}** and
ironies [more **apparent**.]{.underline}

### L---Cartography

#### The 1AC's mapping of Arctic land is part and parcel with the ongoing colonial project of extractivism, whereby the production of geological knowledge serves to rationalize intervention and the dispossession of indigenous peoples from their land.

[This thesis frames the subterranean as a space that is still in the
making and whose constitution is not yet settled. It views the
activities and products of **geological mapping as generative processes
that enable us to imagine the subterranean**, expand down into it and
draw it up into our surface worlds.]{.underline} As I will show in this
thesis, [**geological maps of the Arctic** today, as nearly 500 years
ago, contain reflections of societal meanings and aspirations of what
could or should become of a place, and resultingly, become a mechanism
to invent and **produce**]{.underline} (**[economic]{.underline}**)
**[spaces.]{.underline}**

[The production and realisation of imagined spaces is crucial to the
curation of socio-political and socio-environmental relations with
place.]{.underline} As political ecologists have noted, [**mapping** has
worked to **rationalise colonial interventions into colonised lands**
and supported the **transformation of lands'** existing ecosystems or
communities **into supporting** more **European, 'rationalised' forms of
spatial production**]{.underline} (c.f. Peluso, 1995; Tsing, 2005).
[**These actions enabled** forestry, mining, military or agricultural
use to become established and allowed **capitalist modes of accumulation
by dispossession to occur**]{.underline} (Harvey, 2003). While volumes
and the subterranean emerge in contemporary geographic literature as
relevant to territorial expansion, the extension of nation-states into
new geological frontiers using geological mapping techniques is
sometimes discussed as if it were a practice of the past, restricted to
early-stage (colonial) politics and histories of territorialisation
(Braun, 2000; Scott, 2008; Himley, 2019; Marston, 2019). However,
[**geological** **mapping**]{.underline}, and indeed mapping of
frontiers, [is **not** something that's **finished.** Geographers have
certainly not exhausted the critical leverage that new perspectives in
territorial politics and materiality offer to understand the meanings
and implications of different cartographies.]{.underline}

Geological mapping is not finished because many places that were
inaccessible 30 or 50 years ago have been brought closer to global
networks of geological knowledge and practice via a combination of
technological advances, changes in land tenure regimes, and climate
change opening up previously ice-covered spaces. Examples of this
include deep sea geologies (Childs, 2020), Antarctic landmasses (Yusoff,
2005) and parts of the Canadian Arctic, as discussed in this thesis.
[Expansion of human knowledge into new geological frontiers is therefore
an ongoing process: geological territorialisation and enrolment into
expansionist imaginations is not over, nor are the practices that enable
this to happen.]{.underline}

[Since geological mapping in 'remote' areas of the Earth]{.underline}
(such as parts of the Canadian Arctic or the sea floor) [draws the
natural environment into closer contact with human interference, **areas
that previously avoided intense industrial activity now stand to be
impacted by it.** As such, there is **increased pressure to** evaluate
not only what 'work' geological knowledge is doing to **rationalise
expansion into new**]{.underline} (subterranean) [**territories**, but
also a need to understand what trade-offs are made during the great
pinching together of surface and subsurface space.]{.underline} After
all, [geological knowledge production and the desire-driven philosophy
of resource extraction occurs against a backdrop of other land use
values and philosophies]{.underline} (Simpson, 2019). Political ecology
is well equipped to untangle what happens when these things meet: where
communities, environment and resources come into contact. However, the
story does not end, nor necessarily begin, there. There is, for example,
a need to understand who is making the knowledge we have about geology
and resources, how this happens and to what effect. How is the practice
of geological knowledge production supporting contemporary regimes and
dreamscapes of state-making, and who benefits and gets left behind in
the process?

### L---Disease

#### Pandemics don't just spread illness, they support the state's power to determine who is killable. Colonized and racialized bodies are cast as biologically risky and socially disposable, enabling their abandonment, quarantine, or use as experimental subjects. Disease control enforces biopolitical order by managing who lives, who suffers, and who can be sacrificed in the name of public health. The logic of infection becomes a logic of elimination.

Colonialism and COVID-19

In a roundtable discussion called "Epidemics in the Past and Now: A
Roundtable on Colonial and Postcolonial History," David Arnold remarks,
"The colonial past seems profoundly present in the current pandemic: it
even has the same resonances of class and coercive govern- ment, of
scapegoating and victimization. The colonial has both relevance and
resonance" (C. Anderson et al. 2021). The COVID- 19 pandemic is the
latest in a long line of biological infections to impact societies on a
global scale. Yet, despite its biological basis, COVID-19 is also
aligned with and sutured to social hierarchies that identify some bodies
as riskier than others--- risky bodies as contagious bodies that need to
be contained, neutralized, or expelled from the social and political
body of society. Indeed, as Alexandre White contends, "[the history of
international **infectious** **disease** **control** has largely been
shaped by a **distinctly** **European** **perspective**, prioritising
epidemic threats that arose from **colonial** (or now post- colonial)
**sites** **that** **threatened** **to** **spread** **disease** **and**
**affect** **trade**]{.underline}" (2020, 1251). Alongside other
scholars (e.g., Davis et al. 2019; Yusoff 2021), I would argue that
[**massive** and **dramatic** **planetary** **changes** have been
**accelerated** **by** **colonialism** and have resulted in the
**emergence** **and** **spread** **of** **different** **pandemics**.
Indeed, it was through the **colonial** **project** that
**enlightenment** **notions** **of** **the** **human** were used as the
standard to define the "**inhumanity** **of** **the** **colonial**
**subject**"]{.underline} (Yusoff 2021, 664). [**Those** considered
**nonhuman** **or** **subhuman** became, and continue to be, regarded as
**contagious** **bodies**--- risky bodies that are a source of contagion
but also fodder for **experimentation** **in** **the** **interests**
**of** **advancing** **Western** **medicine**]{.underline}.2

Indeed, as Charles Briggs argues, "[**narratives** about **epidemics**
make **racial** **and** **sexual** **inequalities** seem **natural**
**as** **if** **bacteria** **and** **viruses** gravitate toward
**populations** and respect **social** **boundaries**]{.underline}"
(2005, 272). [In the colonial context, **colonized** **subject**
**races** were essentialized in a similar fashion--- as having an
**essential** **proclivity** **to** **certain** **diseases** **and**
**an** **exceptional** **resistance** **to** **others**]{.underline} (W.
Anderson 1996). A well known case of the intersection of class, race,
gender, and immigration in the narrative construction of diseased
Others, who threaten the social body, is Mary Mallon, a poor Irish
immigrant woman in New York in the early 1900s who was patient zero in
the outbreak of typhoid. Mallon, who became known as Typhoid Mary, was
portrayed as a "mass-spreader" in the media and held in quarantine on
"Northern Brother Island for 26 years till her death" (Banerjee,
Kallivayalil, and Rao 2020, S103). A working class woman and Irish
immigrant (who were racialized at the time), Mallon was thus situated at
various axes of power that worked in concert to orchestrate her
victimization and ability to infect others in the different households
in which she worked. The link between colonialism and disease is
sustained from the attribution of the Bubonic plague to Jews by the
Catholic church in the thirteenth century to today's "epidemic
orientalism" (White 2023), symbolized by the naming of diseases such as
the Hong Kong flu; the Ebola virus, named after a river in the Congo;
the Zika virus, named after a forest in Uganda; and Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome (see also Mallapragada 2021). More recently,
monkeypox has been used to target LGBTQ+ individuals, suggesting that
they are the primary carriers in spite of the reality that the disease
is common across genders and sexualities in Europe and Africa.3
Underpinning this **naming** **of** **diseases** is a **pattern** **of**
**structured** **dominance**, namely, [a whole architecture of how
**colonized** **bodies** have been **viewed**---not only as originators
and carriers of contgion but as **bestial**, **subhuman**, and
**nonhuman**. In fact, the **racialized** and **colonized** **humans**
**were** **seen** **as** **closer** **to** **animals**--- that is,
**nonhumans**--- and therefore more likely to **harbor** **zoonotic**
**diseases**.]{.underline}

The twinning discourses of immigration with germs and diseases, which
has been so prevalent in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) and, more recently, COVID-19, is indicative of how geography,
race, and sexuality are entangled in discourses about diseases (Dionne
and Turkmen 2020). The planetary reach of these definitional categories
and originary frameworks linking disease to colonized bodies and
territories is apparent in the responses of global health organizations
such as the World Health Organization (WHO) to what Nicholas King
defines as the "emerging diseases worldview" (King 2002). To some
extent, he argues, these organizations were created as part of the
civilizing mission with the mandate of surveilling and tracking disease
transmission from colonized territories and implementing controls that
would impede movement from the affected regions of the world to
metropolitan centers of power such as the United States.4 In this
regard, "the colonial project was not only an attempt to establish a
political network, but also to export a vision of bounded geographic
space worldwide" (King 2002, 772). In fact, as Luka Blair points out,
"disease animated much of the colonial discourse on placehood, formed a
central basis for colonial infrastructure, and enabled a moral-
political justification for colonial interventions" (C. Anderson et al.
2021). [Thus, the **securitization** **and** **governance** **of**
**disease** **was** **instrumental** not only to the **perpetuation**
**of** **colonial** **relationships** **of** **power** but also to the
**militarization** **of** **the** **Global** **North** in the wake of
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Indeed, an inherent part of the **emerging**
**disease** **worldview** was designed to **flatten** **borders** and
**boundaries** to **dismantle** **barriers** posed by regional laws and
national patent restrictions for pharmaceutical goods, as well as the
export of Western medical knowledge and expertise.5 Hence, the focus
shifted from one of civilizing underdeveloped nations to inte- grating
them within a global commercial exchange]{.underline}.

[However, when **nonhumans** or **subhumans**, as Yusoff (2018) argues,
traversed into the fold of a **universalized** **sense** **of**
**humanity**, enshrined in the idea of the global, the degree of their
humanness was again predicated on **hierarchies** **of** **worth**,
**power**, and **health**.]{.underline}6 Jingqiu Ren and Joe Feagin
(2021) suggest that [a **hierarchy** **of** **health** **persists**
**wherein** **those** **bodies** **considered** **healthy** **are**
**acceptable** **and** **those** **that** **are** **considered**
**weak** **and** **fallible** **are** **rejected** **by** **the**
**social** **order**. What is **considered** **weak** and **fallible**
**falls** **at** **the** **crossroads** **of** **numerous** **axes**
**of** **oppression** **such as age, sexuality, race, class, religion,
and (dis)ability**. Early twentieth-century eugenicists **explicitly
tied bodily weakness** and **frailty to poor genes** and **advocated for
the extinction of those they deemed not fit to survive.**]{.underline}
Later, in the period of nuclear testing and other kinds of medical
testing between 1945 and 1992 (Arms Control Association 2022), those not
fit to sur- vive became the guinea pigs, metaphorically and actually, of
scientific experiments tracking the impact of these tests.

#### The 1AC glorification of state management as a viable response to pandemics creates states of exceptions that justify surveillance, dictatorship, and increased racial management of populations.

d 'The Invention of An Epidemic': Agamben (2020) endorses in the way
COVID-19 has enabled the tendency to use a state of exception as a
normal paradigm for government. He argues:

[Faced with the frenetic, irrational and entirely unfounded emergency
measures adopted against an alleged epidemic of coronavirus . . . why do
the media and the authorities do their utmost to spread a state of
panic, thus provoking an authentic state of exception with serious
limitations on movement and a suspension of daily life in entire
regions]{.underline}?

Agamben is concerned about 'the growing tendency to use the state of
exception as a normal paradigm of government' where the law has imposed
serious limitations on freedom, and he lists the following:

[(a) prohibition on the removal from the municipality or area concerned
by all individuals present in the municipality or area;\
(b) prohibition of access to the municipality or area concerned;\
(c) suspension of events or initiatives of any kind, of events and of
any form of meeting in a public or private place, including cultural,
recreational, sporting and religious, even if held in closed places open
to the public;\
(d) suspension of educational services for children and schools of all
levels, as well as the frequency of school and higher education
activities, except for distance learning activities;\
(e) suspension of the opening services to the public of museums and
other cultural institutes and places . . .;\
(f) suspension of all educational trips, both on national and foreign
territory;\
(g) suspension of bankruptcy proceedings and of the activities of public
offices, without prejudice to the provision of essential and public
utility services;\
(h) application of the quarantine measure with active surveillance among
individuals who have had close contacts with confirmed cases of diffuse
infectious disease. . . .]{.underline}

It would seem that once terrorism is exhausted as a cause for
exceptional measures, the invention of an epidemic could offer the ideal
pretext to extend them beyond all limits. . . . In a perverse vicious
circle, the limitation of freedom imposed by governments is accepted in
the name of a desire for security that has been prompted by the
governments themselves who now intervene to satisfy it.

e 'A biopolitical dream': Philipp Sarasin (2020), commenting on
Foucault's biopolitics in order to understand the pandemic, sums up the
apogee of the modern conception of politics constituted in terms of the
biological:

[It looks like a biopolitical dream: governments, advised by physicians,
impose pandemic dictatorship on entire populations. Getting rid of all
democratic obstacles under the pretext of 'health,' even 'survival,'
they are finally able to govern the population as they have, more or
less openly, always done in modernity: as pure 'biomass,' as 'bare life'
to be exploited.]{.underline}

He indicates three models by which modern societies have regulated
populations during pandemic events: first, 'The complete lockdown of
Wuhan rigorously follows the plague model, and every curfew ultimately
does so, too'; second, the liberal smallpox model of power---'The
strategy to #flattenthecurve means to reckon with the pathogen and to
know that it cannot be eradicated, but to "extend" its distribution over
time in such a way that the health system can handle it'; third, the old
leprosy model 'is lurking in the background . . . let old people die "to
save the economy"'---or abandon retirement and nursing homes.

In terms of COVID-19 we can significantly add to the analysis of
Foucault-Agamben line by acknowledging a political rationality for the
quarantine and social distancing of the pandemic that seems to suggest a
common theme: the 'quarantined subject' and 'staying at home'. This is
simultaneously a kind of social isolation at the physical level but
[reunification at the level of the command state and nation through the
spectacle of the media, including daily briefings, that asks individuals
and households to willingly curtail their freedoms in the interests of
the popular imaginary of a resilient and caring society.]{.underline}
[The crucial difference is that there is no camp but rather ordinary
life is turned inward on itself with enforced police and neighbourhood
surveillance]{.underline}. One problem with both Agamben and Foucault
(to a lesser extent) is that the analysis is unrelentingly the dark side
that connects the logic of the biopolitical to a state where the
elimination of an ethnic minority in the name of national unity bypasses
constitutional questions and sovereignty to lead us to a one-way
historical street. By contrast to Foucault and Agamben, Roberto Esposito
offers an affirmative bio-politics.

f Roberto Esposito: 'Bios, Immunity, Life'

Roberto Esposito is an Italian philosopher, a professor of theoretical
philosophy at the Scuola Normale Superiore, and one of the founders of
the European Political Lexicon Research Centre and the International
Centre for a European Legal and Political Lexicon. He is an important
philosopher, alongside Giorgio Agamben and Antonio Negri, in theorizing
biopolitics over the last 20 years, especially the origin and destiny of
community in relation to what he calls the 'The Immunization Paradigm',
exploring immunization as a discourse and developing an affirmative
biopolitics based on the three concepts included in the titles of his
trilogy: *Communitas* (2004, orig. 1998), *Immunitas* (2011, orig. 2002)
and *Bios* (2008).

In the essay 'Epidemic Paradoxia: Treated to the Bitter End' for
*Antinomies*, Roberto Esposito (2020) writes:

The fact is that today anyone with eyes to see cannot deny the full
deployment of biopolitics. From biotechnology interventions on areas
once considered exclusively natural such as birth and death, to
biological terrorism, to the management of immigration and more or less
serious epidemics, all current political conflicts have at the center
the relationship between politics and biological life.

Esposito argues that politics and medicine have become mutually linked
and transforming, including both 'a politicization of medicine' and 'a
medicalization of politics', creating a politics very different from its
classic role and profile. Commenting on Italy under the virus,
nevertheless, Esposito suggests that limitations of freedom 'has more
the character of a decomposition of public powers than of a dramatic
totalitarian grip'.

Esposito's work over the last 20 years has explored immunization as
discourse of the self and state and how both are constructed in relation
to foreign bodies with the potential for conflict. The sources for
Esposito's 'Affirmative Biopolitics' are to be found in Mauss
(gift-exchange), Hobbes' social contract, Locke, and Bataille's concept
of sacrifice (Tierney, 2016). His major work, *Immunitas: The Protection
and Negation of Life*, examines the relations between bodies and
societies and argues that 'just as the human body's immune system
protects the organism from deadly incursions by viruses and other
threats, law also ensures the survival of the community in a
life-threatening situation', protecting and prolonging life. The major
paradox, is that 'like the individual body, the collective body can be
immunized from the perceived danger only by allowing a little of what
threatens it to enter its protective boundaries'. The nature of
immunization, Esposito argues, is at the heart of contemporary
biopolitics, characterizing both the nature of the self and society. The
paradox is that immunity functions to incorporate within the body
exactly that foreign elements and external entity that threaten its
existence.

g The Immune Self: A significant range of ontological and
epistemological studies have been focused on theme of 'the immune self'
as 'the central motif of biological identity in the context of
immunity', invoking immunological conceptions of selfhood, including
personal identity, self-image, constructivist and poststructuralist
notions of identity, as well as questions in ecology and evolutionary
biology. As Swiatczak and Tauber (2020) explain:

Immunology, from its earliest inception, has been concerned with
biological identity---its establishment and maintenance. In its original
iteration, immunity was conceived as that function that preserved the
integrity of the organism in terms of protecting and restoring its
individuality. Thus, immune functions testified to the persistence of a
stable, core identity defined in terms of its insularity and autonomy.
Indeed, [individuality undergirded the science from its inception, for
the defense against pathogens was framed by an attacked patient
(individual) pitted against alien others, the invaders.]{.underline}

A major shift of thinking has occurred as dominance of 'the immune self'
and individuality-based biology has given way to communal ecological
perspectives reflecting some larger changes in biology to recognize
environmental studies, eco-immunology and symbiotic ecosystems, leading
to fundamental insights challenging notions of individuality and
pathogenization. Early notions of autonomy as a theoretical foundation
for biology 'complemented Malthusian economics, liberal political
philosophy, and Comtian sociology to instantiate the autonomous body as
a political, social, economic and medical entity' and failed to
comprehend 'the dialectical relationship between the organism and its
environment' (Swiatczak & Tauber, 2020). By contrast, a number of
critical philosophers (Foucault, Agamben, Haraway, Esposito) have
dismantled the old view suggesting 'the "[immune self" appears as a
metaphor to model Western culture, by invoking "immunization" as an
explanatory model for understanding the core dynamics of post-industrial
societies']{.underline} (Swiatczak & Tauber, 2020). These [criticisms
also apply also to notions of the state---'the immuno-state'---that is
theorized on the basis of a dialectics of border and exchange, intrusion
and defence, within an ecological and dynamic systems conception of the
state within an increasingly interconnected and globalized planet,
helping to reconceptualize contemporary immunology through collectivist
models of molecular interaction.]{.underline}

\[The\] ecological orientation has inflected immunology from its earlier
insular conceptions of the organism to a dynamic interactive view that
highlights how life experience alters the immune response to external
challenges and opportunities. With this broadened perspective, the idea
of immunity extends beyond defense of an atomistic individual, to
include the mediation of the organism's ecological economy, both
defensive and assimilative. (Swiatczak & Tauber, 2020)

China as immune-state demonstrated the role of a strong socialist state
that could act quickly to provide social and geopolitical isolation of
neighbourhoods, towns and cities, as well as an enforcement regime.
(Generally Chinese people welcomed and understood the need for such
measures in the collective good.) By contrast the 'immuno-state' in the
US under the Trump regime has proved controversial, often setting itself
against experts and its own scientific advisors, creating an ongoing
fight with governors on safety measures and on 'opening up'. Trump
himself has added to the contradictory nature of advice to the American
people through his own example (e.g., not wearing a mask, championing
false anti- products) and through his briefings. He puts great emphasis
on a busno- technological fix of a vaccine. These two styles of
government---American capitalist vs. Chinese socialist (in all their
differences)---may also determine how successfully these countries 'open
up' and also capitalization of global market opportunities, including
buying distressed strategic companies.

2 Global governance, viral politics and government by conspiracy

a Pandemic I: The First Modern Pandemic: Bill Gates writes: 'The
coronavirus pandemic pits all of humanity against the virus. The damage
to health, wealth, and well-being has already been enormous. This is
like a world war, except in this case, we're all on the same side'. He
emphasizes global innovation and the production of a vaccine.
Immediately after Trump announced the freezing of funds to the WHO, Bill
Gates criticized the action and the Gates Foundation announced it was
increasing its emergency funding over and above the \$100 million global
response funding made in February by an additional \$150 million of
grant funding for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.

b The global governance of health: Chong (2020) suggests that at the
international level, global governance is tied to the control of borders
and the security of the state that can threaten civil rights and the
erosion of civil liberties necessary for democracy:

Much of the public alarm triggered by the outbreak of the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) is greatly bound up with the management of
cross-border security threats. COVID-19 resembles a 21st-century
medieval plague in terms of how little we understand its character and
how vulnerable we are to its effects. . . . The coronavirus crisis is
emblematic of the difficulty of constructively extending good governance
across borders. An effective response requires governments, medical
authorities and civil society to consider a new spatialisation of
threats to human security when making decisions.

Chong (2020) argues that the global biosecurity threat depends upon
information and intelligence sharing in real time, for the COVID-19
virus afflicts everyone irrespective of political allegiance or
nationality, and he suggests, 'The global north and global south must
find a common depoliticised platform to exchange relevant information
about the latest viral threats in much the same way cyber security firms
and national cyber agencies monitor digital viruses in real time'. So
far the very opposite has occurred, with the White House stepping up its
conspiracy campaign against China over the origin and distribution of
the virus, and against the WHO for its alleged mishandling of the
pandemic when its own mismanagement of the pandemic crisis has been
injurious to the American people and the viral crisis has been
politicized as a crucial factor in the coming US election.

c 'Government by conspiracy': The political rationality, based on a
state of exception where the US 'national emergency' permits new powers
to dispense billions, gave three trillion dollars---the historically
largest bail-out---to businesses and unemployment benefits to keep the
economy afloat when borders are closed and will remained closed for the
foreseeable future. Trump's border security territoriality seems to be
achieved in one set of health/economy measures that ruptures daily
economic life. Yet there are clear governmentality differences between
socialist China and neoliberal America in the philosophy of public
health management. After early suppression of information and cover-up
attempts, China acted swiftly and effectively to embrace a total
shutdown of Wuhan and Hubei that quarantined the outbreak. In the US by
contrast, management was interrupted by a denial of COVID-19, the
consequent lack of testing and a disregard for public safety with
attempts to prematurely open up the economy again. As a consequence, the
US's grim COVID-19 statistics have ballooned out to 1.5 million
confirmed cases of infection and nearly 100,000 deaths (May 18).

d The Constitutional Challenge to Lockdown: Increasingly, echoing the
president, people in strong Republican states are contesting lockdown by
citing their inalienable rights enshrined in the US Constitution. As
Geranios (2020), for instance, reports:

In deeply conservative eastern Washington state, a prominent state
lawmaker kicked out of his Republican Party caucus labels the
coronavirus as a foreign bio-weapon, accuses Marxists of using the
pandemic to advance totalitarianism and rails against lockdown
restrictions imposed by the Democratic governor. . . . Across the U.S.,
elected officials from Pennsylvania to Oklahoma suspicious of big
government and outraged with orders to close churches, gun stores and
other businesses deemed non-essential insist that the public health
response is being used as an excuse to trample constitutional rights.

The Far Right suggests that a national emergency has been used to limit
civil freedoms of citizens of the United States. Some are worried about
the State-enhanced surveillance powers and the control over information;
others express concern about the suspension of rights, especially
freedom of association. The 'Stay Home. Saves Lives' campaign's focus on
social distancing, quarantine and breaking the chain of transmission is
now an argument about the constitutionality of government actions.
Paradoxically, the challenge comes from both the Far Right and those
wishing to prevent a totalitarian state. Critics are concerned that the
COVID-19 government responses have been and are being used for ends that
are not related to the preservation of public health.

The confusion around lockdown limitations on freedoms in the US are
partly a result of the contradictions between the federal and state
levels of power, often determined by whether governors are Democrat or
Republican, and the extent to which they are tuned to the centre. This
structure of formal authority and power is made more complex by the fact
that President Trump contradicts his own official announcements and
policies (by tweeting opposing content). There is also often a clear
conflict between what Trump says at briefings and the advice of his
scientific-medical team. These Science---State conflicts relate to the
significance of epidemiological sciences of prediction and mathematical
modelling to estimate exponential rates of infection and
infection-deaths ratios, and the role they play in national emergency
policies.

There are also calls for 'opening up the economy' in the US that Trump
privately supports in his tweets to his followers while at the same time
stressing the importance of social distancing in public. President Trump
has unveiled Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, including
'downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a
14-day period', core State responsibilities in 'preparedness' in terms
of testing and contact-tracing, plans to protect workers and guidelines.
The moral choice of further deaths, especially of frontline workers, and
other trade-offs of economy and risks to health---a choice now left to
governors---has become a calculus that operates at the State level,
generating a significant level risk for all cross-border activities.

3 The immuno-state: biosafety, biosecurity, bioterrorism, biowarfare

a The concept of Biosafety Level as a set of precautions and containment
procedures to isolate dangerous pathogens in the laboratory originated
after World War II and took shape during the 1980s through a set of
conferences to develop a formal organization, The American Biological
Safety Association (ABSA), in 1984 and, later, four levels of biosafety
expressed as BSL1--4. *Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical
Laboratories*, first published in 1984 and now in its 5th edition
(Wilson & Chosewood, 2009), is an advisory document outlining best
practices. It provides guidance on biological risk assessment,
principles of biosafety including biosafety levels, laboratory safety
level criteria (specifying standard microbiological practices, special
practices, safety equipment and laboratory facilities), animal biosafety
level criteria and principles of laboratory biosecurity, as well as a
summary statement of microbiological agents. The Introduction makes
clear the risks associated with expansion of research and bioterrorism:

We are living in an era of uncertainty and change. New infectious agents
and diseases have emerged. Work with infectious agents in public and
private research, public health, clinical and diagnostic laboratories,
and in animal care facilities has expanded. Recent world events have
demonstrated new threats of bioterrorism. For these reasons,
organizations and laboratory directors are compelled to evaluate and
ensure the effectiveness of their biosafety programs, the proficiency of
their workers, as well as the capability of equipment, facilities, and
management practices to provide containment and security of
microbiological agents.

The occurrence of laboratory-associated infections seems limited, with
some 168 deaths recorded between 1930 and 1978, and 22 deaths in the
following 20 years. Risk levels evolved with BSL-4, defined in the
following terms: "Exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of
life-threatening disease by infectious aerosols and for which no
treatment is available are restricted to high containment laboratories
that meet biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) standards."

b The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have more than 1,700
scientists working in some 200 laboratories across the US with the
appointment of one official responsible for overall laboratory safety.
BSL-4 laboratories, as the highest level, require work to be completed
within level II biosafety cabinets, with decontamination procedures,
restricted entry, the wearing of protective suits and chemical showers
on exit. Research takes place on easily transmitted pathogens that can
cause death, including Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, viral hemorrhagic fevers
(VHFs) and Variola virus (which causes smallpox) in two research
centres, one in the US and one in Russia.

c There are some 70 BSL-4 reported laboratories globally with 15 in the
US alone, although the number is not verified. It includes the Center
for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases that has specified BSL
levels. The WHO Consultative Meeting on High/Maximum Containment
(Biosafety Level 4) Laboratories Networking (2018) reports:

BSL-4 laboratories represent the highest level of biological
containment, offering unparalleled protection for the user, sample and
environment. At present, more than 50 maximum- and high-containment
facilities around the globe handle some of the world's most hazardous
pathogens to human and animal health for research and diagnostic
purposes. BSL4 laboratories are located in all WHO regions. While most
are in North America or western Europe, a number have been built in
Asia, and construction projects are underway in China, Japan and
sub-Saharan Africa, raising questions related to sustainability in
low-income countries.

There has been a shift from prescriptive to performance-based biosafety,
emphasizing "the use of practical measures to mitigate risks, including
thorough risk assessments and evidence-based approaches to biosafety,
rather than reliance on rigid classification systems." The meeting
document provided updates on BSL-4 facilities, including planned
high-containment laboratories (Japan, China, UK), high-containment
laboratories under construction (Côte d'Ivoire, US, UK, China), recently
constructed BSL-4 laboratories that are operational (China, Korea,
Australia, Germany), as well as high-containment laboratory networks.

d There have been fears about biosafety and human error rates with these
labs, as well as criticisms of the lack of government regulation in the
US. Alexandra Peters (2019) writes of "the global proliferation of
high-containment biological laboratories":

Disease-causing pathogens have been with humanity for as long as the
species has existed, but the world has changed. The human population is
increasing and becoming more globalised. Meanwhile, the international
system remains unstable and biotechnology is advancing at a breakneck
speed. Humans are coming into contact with new and re-emerging pathogens
as they spread into previously uninhabited environments. Pathogens play
an increasingly global role, and infectious disease is becoming less
confined by geographical or climatic boundaries. In order to meet these
new challenges, both states and the private sector have been building an
increasing number of high-containment biological laboratories (HCBLs)
that work with biosafety level (BSL) 3 and 4 pathogens. This rate has
increased sharply since 11 September 2011, and most states that have the
means to build such laboratories do so. Pathogens do not stop at
borders, and the more prepared a state is to deal with them, the better
for its national security.

In a case study of the US, Peters indicates that there has been a rapid
proliferation of HCBLs and issues to do with the lack of oversight and
reporting with discrepancies in reporting and threats posed by accidents
at government facilities, including the mishandling of anthrax. In terms
of future challenges there are threats of both biological weapons and
bioterrorism. While there has been some progress in terms of better
oversight of HCBLs and an increase in international cooperation, "the
measures that have been taken so far are not yet adequate, and the
degree of oversight and control that states exert over their HCBLs
varies considerably."

e The COVID-19 virus became politicized early on, as Trump by turn first
praised China's handling of the crisis, then as the situation got worse,
pointed the finger and blamed, in order, the media, the governors, the
WHO (freezing funding) and the "Chinese virus", drawing attention to the
Wuhan Lab and deflecting responsibility for the crisis---what we call
"government by conspiracy." The Wuhan Lab conspiracy was supported by
Trump, Pence and Pompeo, but contradicted by their own intelligence and
health advisors like Anthony Fauci, who echoed the scientific consensus
that the COVID-19 virus was "natural" and showed no signs of being
genetically engineered.

f Biosecurity: The concept and preventive measures of biosecurity
developed quickly in the 1990s in relation to the increasing
interconnectivity of globalization to prevent the transmission of
infectious crop and animal diseases that could damage people, the
environment and agrobusinesses. Later it was extended to include
modified organisms (GMOs) and invasive alien species. The first GMO
plants and animals date from the 1970s but it was not until the 1990s
that the first commercial genetically modified food began production.
Bacteria are the easiest to modify and they have been used in research
and food production. Viruses also are modified through transduction
(inserting genetic material), especially in gene therapy. In the 1980s
biosecurity was extended to preventing forms of bioterrorism. Most
recently, biosecurity has been extended again to cope with the growing
exigencies of synthetic biology. The movement toward securitization at
the international level came to include a number of other risks
including generalized public health risks to entire populations, such as
epidemics and pandemics. Increasingly, states within the international
system looked to control malevolent uses of infectious biological
diseases by state and non-state actors. As Koblentz (2010) argues:

Advances in science and technology, the rise of globalization, the
emergence of new diseases, and the changing nature of conflict have
increased the risks posed by naturally occurring and man-made biological
threats. A growing acceptance of a broader definition of security since
the end of the Cold War has facilitated the rise of biosecurity issues
on the international security agenda.

Biosecurity has come to encompass a wide range of biological threats
that include natural, accidental and deliberate disease outbreaks, and
states now need a comprehensive framework to enforce border security
increasingly at the viral level.

g The risks of bioterrorism: Bioterrorism using micro-organisms or
infected samples to cause terror and panic in populations is an ancient
form. Hittites sent infected rams to their enemies and the British in
1763 reportedly gave indigenous people blankets infected with smallpox.
In the modern context these threats have been highlighted following the
World Trade Center attack of September 2001 with the "anthrax" scare
(FBI code Amerithax) where spores were mailed to Democratic senators,
killing five people and infecting 17. Already in the COVID-19 pandemic,
White supremacists who have tested positive have been encouraged to
infect Jews and cops.

h Biowarfare and bioweapons: The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC,
1972) was the first international treaty to effectively prohibit an
entire category of weapons of mass destruction. It has been confirmed by
183 states, including the US and UK. The BWC bans the development,
stockpiling, acquisition, retention and production of (i) biological
agents and toxins "of types and in quantities that have no justification
for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes" and (ii)
weapons, equipment and delivery vehicles "designed to use such agents or
toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict." Despite the
international treaty, it has failed to stop countries from conducting
offensive weapons research and large-scale production of biological
weapons. The BWC has no inspection or verification procedures and while
only a few countries are known to have bioweapons programs, the
development of bioweapons compared to nuclear weapons are inexpensive
and both easy to acquire and to hide behind benign research
institutions. To add to these difficulties, much of the information
concerning the production of harmful pathogens are available on the
Internet.

i\
The immuno-state faces increasing levels of risk from globalization and
the transmission of harmful viruses, bacteria and infectious diseases
across international borders that are difficult to detect and police,
especially air-borne and ocean-borne agents. The threat of biological
weapons seems weak. The argument has been that rational state agents are
unlikely to use this means of warfare given the risks of blow-back and
control issues. Natural and accidental pathogens are more likely risks,
and threats to the environment and to agriculture also represent a
greater cause for concern. Modern immunology since its inception has
used a philosophical language consisting of "self" and "nonself" or
"self/foreign." Such language has given way to community and ecological
models that recognize mutualism and symbiotic relationships between the
organism and the environment. [The state as an organism is part of an
underlying political environment that seeks to manage the macro immune
system. In classical politics the metaphor of the natural body to the
body politic operated on a metaphor that compared diseases to political
afflictions (civil conflict, dissent, resistance). The body politic has
passed from a sovereignty of death to a body politic to preserve life
and health of the population. The interpretation of the social in
biological terms has led to Social Darwinism and the racial state
governed by a notion of population hygiene that has been adopted and
refined recently by the Far Right to fuel contemporary notions of
nationalism and populism.]{.underline}

### L---Extinction

#### Utilitarianism's prioritization of potential human life over present suffering is [indebted]{.underline} to the logic of extinctiopolitics---a necropolitical decision-making calculus built on the hierarchical ordering of speculative risk. 

Joe P.L. **Davidson 22**, Leverhulme Early Career Fellow in the
Department of Sociology at the University of Warwick, PhD in the
Department of Sociology at the University of Cambridge, September 2022,
"Extinctiopolitics: Existential Risk Studies, the Extinctiopolitical
Unconscious, and the Billionaires' Exodus From Earth," *New Formations:

*MUSE*, https://muse.jhu.edu/article/881492) DJDubb

[The futural perspective of **extinctiopolitics**]{.underline} has
several important effects. Biopolitics [**is** defined by **a
utilitarian logic**]{.underline}; it is [**concerned with**]{.underline}
maximising utility across the population. Indeed, on the biopolitical
perspective, the vigour of one part of the population may be dependent
on the demise of another part of the population. As Mbembe emphasises,
biopolitics involves [the zero-sum game of **deciding**
']{.underline}who is able to live and **[who must die']{.underline}**;
certain people die [(especially those in the 'death-worlds' of the
colonial zone) **so that others survive**]{.underline} (Necropolitics,
p66, p92, emphasis in original). This logic is mirrored by
extinctiopolitics, which is also concerned with maximising utility.
However, on the 'total [utilitarianism]{.underline}' advanced by the
field, utility [refers **not only** to **people** alive **in the present
but all** the **potential humans** that could be alive at any point in
time]{.underline}.24 As Ord puts it: 'Our lives matter just as much as
those lived thousands of years ago, or those a thousand years hence'
(The Precipice, p28). The biopolitical task of 'distributing the living
in the domain of value and utility' is thus understood in terms of the
life of the species as a whole. 25 The expansive utilitarianism of
existential risk studies means that the future has a strong hold on the
present. Given that a minuscule portion of the total number of humans
that could exist are alive in the present moment, there is a strong
compulsion to act in favour of the many billions of potential people
that may exist in the future. Reducing existential risk is an especially
pressing priority; if humanity is extinguished, these potential lives
will be lost forever. [**The infinite mass of hypothetical people** in
the future **is granted a privileged position over** the handful of
**people** alive **in the present**.]{.underline} Extinctiopolitics
involves the 'power to foster life or disallow it to the point of
death'; [people in **the present** may be **sacrificed to increase
utility in the future**]{.underline} (History of Sexuality, p138).

If the negative side of biopolitics involves the utilitarian logic of
distributing life and death, then the positive side of biopolitics
involves the improvement and strengthening of the population.
Existential risk studies shares this biopolitical utopianism, but it
understands it as something that can only be achieved in the very
distant future. Andrew Leigh, largely drawing on Bostrom and Ord,
suggests that humanity is capable of building a 'heavenly paradise' ...
'this future is probable if humans can survive for another thousand
years. And it is almost certain if humans can survive for ten thousand
years'.26 More specifically, in common with biopolitics, **[there is a
quasi-eugenicist current to this image of the future]{.underline}**,
with Bostrom declaring in his transhumanist 'Letter from Utopia' (2008)
[that humanity will be substantially different at an ontological level
in the future]{.underline}.27 For instance, Bostrom predicts that, in
his utopia, life expectancy will be greater than 500 years and the
majority of the population will have 'cognitive capacities more than two
standard deviations above the current human maximum'.28

The future of humanity, as imagined by Bostrom and Ord, is dependent on
one very important factor: avoiding existential risk. If the normative
dimension of existential risk studies involves a utilitarian claim about
future possibility, then the empirical dimension of the field focuses on
identifying the most salient dangers to humanity. Like biopolitics more
generally, [**there is a keen concern with the calculation of risk** in
extinctiopolitics;]{.underline} both are concerned with [aggregating
information to predict, prevent, and regulate threats.]{.underline}29
Indeed, [there is an actuarial logic to]{.underline} existential risk
studies; thinkers associated with the movement are concerned with
[assigning probabilities to catastrophic dangers]{.underline}. Yet,
certain risks are much more significant than others for
extinctiopolitics. The risks that ultimately matter are those that have
the capacity to cause human extinction or, at very least, 'permanently
and drastically curtail \[humanity's\] potential' in the long-term
future (Existential Risk, p5). In Bostrom's words, other forms of risk,
even ones that cause widespread death such as genocides and world wars,
are 'mere ripples on the surface of the great sea of life' (Existential
Risk, p5). The task of existential risk studies is to calculate a
probability for an unprecedented event: human extinction. There is a
general agreement in the field that it is unlikely that human extinction
will occur from natural causes (see The Precipice, p92). Instead, the
real threats stem from the actions of humanity itself. With some
consistency, scholars associated with existential risk studies pinpoint
artificial intelligence as the key threat to humanity
(Superintelligence; The Precipice). Misaligned artificial intelligence,
or superintelligent machines that are indifferent to human life, is
granted huge destructive potential. On Ord's quantification of the
existential risk landscape, there is a one in ten risk that artificial
intelligence will cause the extinction of humanity or severely undermine
its long-term potential in the next century (The Precipice, p81).

With **[this attempt to calculate]{.underline}** the probabilities of
[different **risks and arrange them in a hierarchy of
seriousness,**]{.underline} existential risk studies
**[reinforces]{.underline}** what Frédéric Neyrat calls [the
'**biopolitics** of catastrophe']{.underline}, the distinctive mark of
[which is a 'continuous exacerbated sensitivity to
risks']{.underline}.30 Extinctiopolitics posits that existential risk is
the key question of our time; we are living in an especially critical
moment of human history. Humanity, over the last century, has acquired
the technological power to annihilate itself but lacks the moral and
political resources required to control this new destructive capacity.
As Bostrom stresses: '...our species is introducing entirely new kinds
of existential risk -- threats we have no track record of surviving'.31
Ord suggests that the current era of history, which he terms 'the
Precipice', is defined by 'the highest levels of risk' (The Precipice,
p23). Either humanity will succeed in mastering the instruments of
annihilation and build a transhuman future or it will succumb to them
and lose this potential for paradise forever.

Echoing Rosa Luxemburg's famous declaration of socialism or barbarism,
existential risk studies claims that the options are utopia or
extinction. The starkness of this choice shapes the concrete political
changes advocated by the field. Many of the [**reforms**]{.underline}
advanced by scholars [associated with]{.underline} existential risk are
relatively constrained. In contrast to Luxemburg, **[preventing
extinction]{.underline}** and realising utopia [**will not require** the
fundamental **transformation of social relations**]{.underline}.
Instead, [they propose greater funding for bodies concerned with
preventing global catastrophe]{.underline}. For instance, Ord notes that
the 'international body responsible for the continued prohibition of
bioweapons (the Biological Weapons Convention) has an annual budget of
just \$1.4 million -- less than the average McDonald's restaurant' (The
Precipice, p33). Furthermore, there is a close association between
existential risk studies and the effective altruism movement, which
instructs its followers to choose careers that do good in the world or
donate a percentage of their earnings to charitable causes (Ripples,
pp16-22). In a similar fashion, Ord encourages those concerned about
extinction to become artificial intelligence safety researchers or
donate some of their wages to support research into existential risk
(The Precipice, pp102-103). These strategies are symptomatic of the
emergent status of extinctiopolitics as a form of biopolitics. If
biopolitics has resulted in the establishment of academic disciplines
and government departments, the epistemological and institutional
resources of extinctiopolitics are much more limited.

However, existential risk studies has larger ambitions than guiding
career choices and boosting the funding of research institutions. If,
for Foucault, biopolitics' 'technology of security' aims at 'achieving
an overall equilibrium that protects the security of the whole from
internal dangers', then the technology of security advocated by
extinctiopolitics is more dynamic; it is concerned with achieving
security via perfection rather than equilibrium (Society Must be
Defended, p249). As Schuster and Woods note, for Bostrom, 'it would be
an existential risk to not pursue utopia' (Calamity Theory, p34,
emphasis in original). The threats faced by humanity can be defused
through a 'sustainable trajectory' of technological development
(Existential Risk Prevention, p26). New technologies are double-sided:
they increase existential risk but can also be used to safeguard the
future of humanity. For example, spreading out into the cosmos, to use
the actuarial logic of extinctiopolitics, offers an insurance option
against the extinction of humanity. Bostrom stresses that the 'failure
to colonise \[space\]' will mean that humanity is more likely to 'fall
victim to an existential risk'.32 As such, a pressing priority of the
contemporary moment is to advance aerospace technologies: 'For every
year that development of such technologies and colonisation of the
universe is delayed, there is therefore a corresponding opportunity
cost: a potential good, lives worth living, is not being realised'
(Astronomical Waste, p308). With comments like these, the appeal of
existential risk studies to space entrepreneurs like Musk becomes clear:
without the billionaire exodus from the Earth, doom is more likely.

WHAT DOES EXTINCTIOPOLITICS DO?

In the previous section, I refrained from critically analysing
extinctiopolitics. However, even from a cursory overview of the field of
existential risk studies, serious limitations are apparent. Building on
the critical accounts of the field published in recent years, several
key points should be highlighted. Normatively speaking, the total
**[utilitarianism]{.underline}** advanced by Bostrom and Ord [appears to
**prioritise** the **survival** of the human species **over** the
**wellbeing** of actually existing people]{.underline} (The Dangerous
Ideas; Democratising Risk). Karin Kuhlemann, adapting Parfit's example
above, instructively contrasts two possible scenarios: one in which 'a
global catastrophe causes ninety-nine per cent of the human population
to slowly starve to death' and the second in which 'the human lineage
gently dwindles into extinction without any suffering (e.g. because
individuals lose interest in procreation)'.33 On the logic of
existential risk studies, the former scenario is preferable because,
despite causing a huge amount of suffering to living people, it
safeguards the future of the species. [The **utilitarian** logic of
**extinctiopolitics sidelines** the **suffering** of actual people
**and**, worse, **could be used to justify inflicting suffering** in the
name of protecting the future of humanity]{.underline} (Calamity Theory,
p24, p52).34 If it is the case that space colonisation is one of the
best strategies for protecting the future of the species, [any
**exploitation and oppression**]{.underline} associated with initiatives
like Musk's SpaceX [**are legitimate**; they are **a small price to be
paid for reducing existential risk.**]{.underline}

The empirical account of the threats facing humanity can also be
questioned. In particular, as discussed further below, since there is
only a small possibility that climate change will totally eliminate
humanity, it is deprioritised by philosophers associated with
existential risk (see The Dangerous Ideas). Furthermore, [while there is
a particular focus on the risks]{.underline} posed by technology, such
as nuclear weapons, synthetic biology and artificial intelligence,
[there is **very little attention to**]{.underline} the [**social and
political structures**]{.underline} that shape these technologies and
how they are used.35 [Systematic d**iscussions of capitalism,
colonialism, racism, patriarchy**]{.underline} and so on **[are entirely
absent]{.underline}** in the writings of Bostrom and Ord. Moreover, [the
field obscures the differential effects of catastrophes; **the**
combined and **uneven consequences of extinction** across space and time
**are flattened**.]{.underline} For instance, [there is **no
acknowledgement that**, **for many** Indigenous peoples, **the end of
the world** is not something for the future but, instead, an event that
**has already happened**]{.underline} (I return to this point in the
final section).

Finally, it is unclear whether the solutions posited by existential risk
studies are adequate. Bostrom and Ord, against Günther Anders'
pessimistic claim in the face of nuclear disaster that 'the possibility
of our self-extinction cannot end -- except through the end itself ',
assert that humanity will eventually escape the age of existential
risk.36 In the utopian world imagined, preventing extinction is no
longer a priority; existential risk will have been conquered. However,
as others stress, the utopian ambitions of the field may increase rather
than reduce existential risk.37 For example, the advanced technologies
required for space colonisation could be easily refunctioned for
destructive ends and trigger what Daniel Deudney calls an 'astrocide',
or 'the extinction of humanity caused directly or indirectly by
largescale human space expansion' (Dark Skies, p362). Moreover, just as
the social causes of catastrophe are obscured, the social relations of
the future utopia are vaguely described; it appears that the future
world of liberation will leave the structures of the present untouched.
Indeed, the positive content of the transhumanist utopia imagined by
Bostrom reflects and reinforces social inequalities. As Claire Colebrook
notes, the lionisation of cognitive activity as the sine qua non of the
future world is 'bound up with the "man" of Western reason', a figure
that is strongly associated with many forms of oppression and violence
(especially in relation to race, disability, gender and sexuality)
(Lives Worth Living, p167).

In the light of the dubious normative consequences, skewed empirical
account of the threats to humanity and flawed vision of the liberated
future, it is difficult to affirm extinctiopolitics. However, these
criticisms do not examine why extinctiopolitics has emerged in the
current conjuncture. What is the relationship between, on the one hand,
thinking the future in terms of threats to human extinction and, on the
other, the social struggles, political crises and cultural anxieties of
the last two decades? What is it about existential risk studies that
resonates with philosophers at prestigious universities and billionaires
in the tech industry? As David Sepkoski argues more generally, there is
a close association between, on the one hand, discourses of extinction
and, on the other, the social and political context in which they are
elaborated.38 For instance, the theory that the dinosaurs were
annihilated by an asteroid that triggered huge climatic changes, which
was first proposed in the 1980s, can be understood in terms of broader
Cold War anxieties about the threat of a nuclear winter. The past end of
the dinosaurs and the future end of humanity were bound together by
widespread fascination with 'sudden, cataclysmic events capable of
obliterating life in the flash of an atomic blast or an asteroid impact'
(Catastrophic Thinking, p298). Given this, are there similar resonances
at play in the popularity of existential risk studies in the
contemporary moment?

It should first be stressed that this is a subversive question to pose
to extinctiopolitics. For existential risk studies, we need to abstract
ourselves from the immediate concerns of the contemporary moment. [The
object of extinctiopolitics is the long-term trajectory of
humanity]{.underline}; it traces the entire history of the species from
its origins to its multiplanetary and transhumanist future. From this
perspective, [the **political and social concerns** of the present
moment,]{.underline} especially those [that **are deemed**
non-existential]{.underline} in their stakes, [are
**insignificant.**]{.underline} For instance, Leigh encourages us to
place ourselves in the grand arc of human history: 'Suppose humanity's
potential time on the planet was shrunk down to a single eighty-year
life span. In that event, we would now be a newborn baby -- just nine
days old' (What's the Worst, p10). Indeed, scholars associated with
existential risk studies voice frustration with politicians for their
short-term perspective; they respond to today's headlines rather than
the long-term interests of the species. Ord recounts that: 'When I have
raised the topic of existential risk with senior politicians and civil
servants, I have encountered a common reaction: genuine deep concern
paired with a feeling that addressing the greatest risks facing humanity
was "above my pay grade"' (The Precipice, p35). Similarly, William
MacAskill, another proponent of existential risk studies, recalls the
response when he talked about future pandemics at a meeting with Nicola
Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, in 2017: 'Everyone laughed,
and the host of the dinner, Sir Tom Hunter, joked that I was "freaking
everyone oot"'.39

However, [**the disavowals of presentism** amongst the proponents of
existential risk studies **should not be taken at face value**. There
are resonances between extinctiopolitics and the conjuncture in which it
emerged;]{.underline} it is entangled with a set of concerns that are
specific to the moment of the 2000s and 2010s. [**Extinctiopolitics
chimes with the broader feeling of crisis and catastrophe** that has
emerged since the turn of the millennium.]{.underline} It is perhaps no
accident that 2002 witnessed the publication of Bostrom's foundational
paper on existential risk and the establishment of Musk's aerospace
company SpaceX. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, as Phillip
E. Wegner notes, marked the decisive end of the long 1990s in the
American context.40 Like the extinction risks highlighted by Bostrom,
the event of 9/11 inaugurated a new understanding of the future in which
it is defined not by endless peace and prosperity but instead decisive
caesuras and disastrous failures. Furthermore, [the **catastrophic
consciousness** fostered by existential risk studies **has found succour
in a range of events** in the decades that have followed **9/11,**
including **the global financial crisis of 2007/08,** **the rise of
authoritarian populist governments** across Europe and North America in
the 2010s, the **COVID-19** pandemic that began in 2020 **and the
Russian invasion of Ukraine** in 2022.]{.underline} However,
[**extinctiopolitics has a particular affinity with the apocalyptic mood
that surrounds the current climate crisis**,]{.underline} something
captured by Greta Thunberg's declaration that the world is on fire and
Extinction Rebellion's claim that we are living in a climate
emergency.41 The 'Anthropocene is the Apocalypse', its arrival marking
the end of the relative stability of the Holocene era and a beginning of
a new world of radical ruptures and unprecedented events.42 In this
context, images of human extinction become convincing. In the face of
the revenge of Gaia, what hope is there for humanity?

### L---Extractivism

#### Extractivism operates through the logic of necrocapitalism: it racializes, dispossesses, and expels Indigenous communities while masking violence behind liberal development narratives. Extractive infrastructures mark Indigenous land and life as expendable to capitalist accumulation, producing "death-worlds" under the guise of progress, law, and democracy. Even when Indigenous voices are "included," their consent is instrumentalized to legitimate dispossession. The state no longer needs to kill directly\--it simply lets Indigenous life decay under state-sanctioned petro-development.

As the twenty-frst century unfolds, extractivism is once again a
determining force in Canada's political economy. The new millennium came
with a boom in the energy resources demand stimulated by changes in the
global economy, at a time when reserves classifed as conventional
decreased and prices increased. It is at the new frontiers of extraction
where advances in extractive technologies (such as fracking) became
increasingly present for the development of what Klare (2010)
denominates extreme energies. This new boom in the hydrocarbon sector
has marginalized the traditional extractive industries that marked
national development during the twentieth century (e.g., mining, fshing,
and forestry), on the one hand, and has reformed the economy, politics,
and society, on the other, by positioning the hydrocarbon sector at the
center of the national development strategy, in order to
re-internationalize the domestic economy and consolidate the country as
an "energy power" (Veltmeyer and Bowles 2014, 59) or as a "petrostate"
(Homer-Dixon 2013).

Nonetheless, extractivism is a highly contested issue in Canadian
politics, exposing the economic, colonial, and ecological contradictions
of its society. Therefore, the same enthusiasm that has renewed
extractivism as a development path in Canada has also rekindled
resistance forces to it. [The **main** **conficts** **between**
**First** **Nations1** (potentially identifed as marginalized by the
destruction of extractivist projects) **and** the **Canadian** **state**
rely on the **relentless** **attempts** to **dispossess** **indigenous**
**peoples** **of** **their** **land** **and** **culture**]{.underline}
(Fast 2014).[country **as** **an** "**energy** **power**"]{.underline}
(Veltmeyer and Bowles 2014, 59) [or as a "**petrostate**"]{.underline}
(Homer-Dixon 2013).

[Historically, indigenous peoples have followed resistance practices to
refuse several forms of capital accumulation that lead to the
dispossession and annihilation of their livelihoods and identity.
Resistance has allowed communities to have control over their
territories and lead the negotiations with corporations to get benefts
out of the resource development. In this sense, they have worked on
strategies to resist and contest a powerful, complex, and dynamic
industry that is supported by local, provincial, and federal
governments, which have assumed the role of facilitator of extractivism
(Garvie and Shaw 2016, 1009--10). However, as we shall see by the end of
this chapter, the benefits from resource development also represent a
form of dispossession for the local communities under a costume of
development, human rights, indigeneity, and democracy]{.underline}

Having said that, and to contribute to the necropower debate in North
America, specifcally the "rule of law necropower" (see Estévez's
defnition in Chap. 2), this study underlines how necropower has become
critical for neoliberal governmentalities. Perspectives on Marxism,
necropolitics, and extractivism are taken first to explain the Canadian
necrocapitalist context. These studies help explain how the narratives
and technologies of development and democracy have marked the pattern of
white-settler colonial relations for the extraction of natural resources
and dispossession of the ethnic minorities in Canada. Subsequently, we
use the Northern Gateway Project (NGP) to illustrate: first, how
contemporary necrocapitalist relations materialize under a legal
framework; second, how the apparatuses and subjects of necrocapitalism
work to dispossess and marginalize indigenous peoples in Canada despite
their inclusion in the decision-making processes; and third, how the
resistance forces have been confgured in this context. Finally, a
discussion is set on whether the indigenous resistance movements are
actually contesting necrocapitalism through resistance and cooptation of
white-settler tools; or whether necrocapitalism is still
reproducing---now adapted in discourses of indigeneity and
democracy---to lead the marginalized to new forms of dispossession.

[Huber (2009) and Fast (2014) have analyzed the fossil fuel extraction
in the capitalist model to explain the capitalist social relations based
on capital and labor.]{.underline} Considering that hydrocarbons provide
the necessary energy for the model, it [promotes their **extraction** on
greater scales and depths due to an extractive hyperdrive that is
**embedded** in the **logic** **of** **exploitation** of the **labor**
**force**, based on the capacity of a **class** **of** **citizens**
**to** **extract** **a** **surplus** **from** **another** **class**
**of** **citizens** **who** **do** **not** **own** **or** **manage**
**capital**.]{.underline} In most of the cases, these capitalist social
relations have been part of what Marx (2010) called primitive
accumulation: the historical process by which peasants and small
producers were separated from their land and its means of production.2
With this in mind, and through decades and uncountable examples, the
capitalist model---more than promoting the development of populations as
Adam Smith would postulate---has generated death worlds, a contemporary
form of subjugating life to the power of death known as necropolitics
(or politics of death) (Mbembe 2003).

Scholars such as Montag (2005), Banerjee (2008), and Estévez (2018) have
used the necropolitics perspective to analyze the economic situation of
the least favored. For instance, Montag argues that it is possible to
speak of necro-economics (a space to let die or expose to death) when
necropolitics in an economic context are interested in the production of
death or in subjugating life to the power of death (Montag 2005, 11).
Banerjee develops the concept of necrocapitalism to portray a series of
contemporary practices of organizational accumulation involving the
subjugation of life to the power of death (e.g., dispossession,
violence, torture, suicide, slavery, and destruction of livelihoods,
among others) by specifc economic actors in postcolonial contexts. Also,
related specifcally to the relation between necropolitics, capitalism,
and extractivism, Banerjee argues that fossil extractivism has been one
of the main longstanding phenomena that has produced more blood through
dispossession, colonial conquest, military coups, wars, corruption,
global politics, and power. Finally, Estévez approaches the role of
necropolitics in government processes as a power device to manage death,
highlighting that in the heart of the interpretative frameworks for the
regulation of life (biopolitics) and death (necropolitics) are found the
relations of production, where at present, life is led toward its
expansion, precariousness, or extinction with the aim to infuence in the
capitalist economic relations.

[Dispossession is the feature that best portrays the Canadian
extractivist context from a necrocapitalist perspective. There are two
types of dispossession practices: material and immaterial. The former
are related to]{.underline} what Harvey calls accumulation by
dispossession: [privatization of land]{.underline} (and the subsequent
forced expulsion of peasants), [the conversion of public property into
private property, the restrictions on the public use of common property
resources, the neocolonial asset appropriation practices, the control
over natural resources in the former colonies, and the suppression of
alternative indigenous forms of consumption and production]{.underline}
(Harvey 2005, 145). [The latter]{.underline} are found in the works of
Bebbington et al. (2008) and Merino Acuña (2015) [and referred to as
dispossession of health, way of life, means of obtaining resources,
sociocultural practices, and identities; forms of dispossession that are
conferred by Gržinić and Tatlić (2014) as symbolic death, and clustered
in Mbembe's living dead conception.]{.underline}

Based on this defnition, for the purposes of this chapter,
[**extractivism** in both developing and developed countries, such as
Canada, is a **feature** **of** **necrocapitalism** that considers
**nature** **as** a **resource** **for** **appropriation**; economic
growth as an **endless** **process** for **development**;
**accumulation** as a **natural** **activity**; and **dispossession** as
a practice that **subjugates** **life** **to** **the** **power** **of**
**death**.]{.underline} But whose life is in danger in those
extractivist spaces? Specifcally, who are the proletarians, dispossessed
and marginalized in the Canadian context?

Two features are relevant to Canadian necrocapitalism: European
colonialism and the racial classifcation that came along with it. The
result was a proletarianization, dispossession, and use of indigeneity
as an object of government to facilitate, control, or challenge resource
development to the present day (Procter 2016, 288). [As fossil
hydrocarbons played an essential role in managing and maintaining
political and social control during the white-settler colonialism,3 the
settlers sought permanent access to the territory and
resources.]{.underline} They employed the elimination of indigenous
peoples as a strategy (Huseman and Short 2012, 222) using means such as
genocide, assimilation, and restrictive recognition policies (Strakosch
and Macoun 2012). [From a **necrocapitalist** **perspective**, this
attempt to **erase** **indigeneity** **from** **the** **land** was more
than **an** **act** **of** **exploitation**; it was a need for
**replacement** (Wolfe 1999), that turned into "**national**
**sacrifce**" in the **name** **of** **national** **development** and
**industrial** **expansion**]{.underline} (Hooks and Smith 2004).
Likewise, colonial encounters of racial order contributed to the
imagined formation of the ideal Canadian citizen. Mainly, because the
British empire supported the creation of the Canadian state based on
British ideals (Moreton-Robinson 2015).4

Despite Canada assumed sovereignty over its vast northern territories,
white-settler practices continued. The hydrocarbon industry was one of
the main postcolonial attempts to promote a modernization agenda in the
North through the subsidized provision of infrastructure and capital to
support private sector development and strategic military mega-projects
(Keeling and Sandlos 2009, 122). However, the overall well-being of the
population decreased in part due to causes attributed to accumulation by
dispossession policies that tried to marginalize indigenous peoples and
communities with the goal of eliminating them, if not physically,
ideologically and culturally.5

[In the Canadian national imagination, the North is still a vast, empty,
cold, and uninhabited territory. Racism, inherent in the discourses of
colonialism and development, is still manifested most visibly not
through relocation decisions per se, but through the elimination of
indigenous territorial interests and their concerns about the
socio-ecological resource developments impacts]{.underline} (Keeling and
Sandlos 2009, 122). Coulthard points out that primitive accumulation has
not precisely generated proletarianization in Canada (Coulthard 2014, 7
and 13). [Instead, the economic, gender, racial, and state powers have
been structured in a relatively safe or sedimented set of hierarchical
social relations to facilitate dispossession of indigenous peoples from
their lands and self-determined authority.]{.underline}

The Canadian government's imperialist design remains evident in its
relations with First Nations and in the way it has proceeded to
implement its national development plan on the one hand, and to set the
foundations for giving green light to new projects on the other. It is
worth mentioning that these relations and the federal government's
policies---for example, assuming decision-making rights, reserving
certain delimited areas for aboriginal communities, and extending the
authority of the Canadian state over indigenous peoples---have not been
carried out on the basis of equality between sovereign nations but
rather as an imperial and colonial power relation (Veltmeyer and Bowles
2014, 64).

### L---Geoengineering

#### Geoengineering is an extension of white technoscientific rationality that imagines planetary crisis as technical problem solvable by expert-led innovation---reinforcing violent sociotechnical imaginaries that erase non-Western knowledge and enables elite scientific authority to govern planetary survival through high-stakes experimentation.

To develop the argument above the article first considers the
proposition that issues of climatic and ecological crisis are not easily
captured within conceptions of 'global (in)security' and should instead
be considered as distinct issues of planetary crisis, emergency, and
insecurity. Debates on planetary crisis are wide-ranging,
transdisciplinary and give rise to potentially radically diﬀerent
normative positions and institutional recommendations as to how to
respond. They are arguably minimally bound, though, by the sense that
existing concepts and understandings of the world and the ways in which
we live in it must be altered in response (see Chakrabarty, 2018). Of
course, who ' we ' are in this respect and what 'it' is, in terms of
'the world' we live in and how it works, are all issues that are
subjects of potential contestation and degrees of uncertainty. With that
in mind, the discussion below focuses on how [proposals for **planetary
crisis management** are]{.underline} frequently [predicated on the
**'perpetual gamble'** that 'there will]{.underline} in fact [always
be]{.underline} at some point [a technological solution to the problems
created, and so there would be no need to opt for immediate and radical
social change that prevents such problems manifesting']{.underline}
(Gills and Morgan, 2019: 7; see also Asayama, 2015, p. 92). It is in
this sense, the article seeks to argue, that [the **sociotechnical
imaginaries**]{.underline} (Jasanoﬀ, 2015) [associated with]{.underline}
proposals for **[geo-and climate-engineering]{.underline}** should be
critically interrogated. Constituting as they often do forms of
technological utopianism that [seek to preserve the conditions for the
**continuation of 'market civilization'**]{.underline} (Gill, 2019; see
also Moore, 2016), such proposals are most often [predicated
on]{.underline} an understanding of technopolitics that already presumes
[**a prior assumption of who 'we ' are** and a corresponding mode of
life to be preserved]{.underline}. In addition, [proposals
for]{.underline} climatic and [geoengineering]{.underline} also
[necessarily]{.underline} define not only the world as a planetary space
but also the ways in which 'it' is threatened. In particular, these
proposals tend to **[circumscribe the meaning of crisis]{.underline}**
primarily if not solely as 'climate crisis' which, as is discussed later
in the paper, is a conception of crisis that is potentially open to
critique.

Critical scholarship on the planetary tends to stress the ways in which
'old' paradigms (cf. Fagan, 2017; Pedersen, 2020) of security-- even
those thought to be operative at a global scale-- are being called into
question by conditions of planetary emergency and crisis. Climatic and
**[geoengineering proposals]{.underline}**, conversely, [imagine
scenarios and technologies for **preserving the conditions of modern
life** as far as possible]{.underline} (Altvater, 2016). [Although such
proposals]{.underline} for planetary crisis management might ostensibly
seem to [share much **in common with imagery and tropes of science
fiction**]{.underline}, as is illustrated below they have and continue
to be given serious consideration and investment by select political and
scientific elites. [If implemented]{.underline}, they [may actually
**exacerbate conditions of planetary inequality, insecurity and
crisis**]{.underline}, but it is nevertheless also likely that as
conditions of planetary emergency intensify, so too will interest in and
exploration of applications of climatic and geo-engineering. Thus, as
well as taking seriously considerations of how forms of planetary crisis
disrupt 'the global' , critical scholarship, as is argued and
illustrated below, should also pay sustained attention to the ways in
which in which proposals to manage planetary crisis are predicated upon,
and may serve to further, the imagination and perpetuation of capitalist
industrial modernity.

Global uncertainties, insecure globalities

At least as notable as the rise and recurrence of'the global' within
discourses of security is the ten- dency to relate that term to
associated degrees of ambiguity and uncertainty. The'Global Uncer-
tainties' programme of research funding in the UK, for example, as one
of the foremost initiatives in this vein (see, e.g. EPSRC, 2019; STEPS,
2019) has been predicated precisely on a need to fund research to
reduce' core ' global uncertainties associated with'cyber-security' ,
'ideol- ogies and beliefs' , 'proliferation of chemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear and explosive weapons and technologies' ,
'terrorism' , 'threats to infrastructure' and'transnational organised
crime' (EPSRC, 2019). If, such endeavours propose, epistemological
uncertainty can be reduced in relation to these kinds of core issues,
they may remain critical but can come to be more manageable and possibly
even reframed as policy'challenges' to be addressed and ameliorated.
How, when and why specific issues come to be designated both as global
uncertainties and ' core ' is, though, less immediately clear. Although
the longer list of issues cited above persists in some quarters (e.g.
EPSRC, 2019), the more recent evolution of the overarching initiative to
fund research into global uncertainties has been revised to focus
specifically on a shortened list of the'complex challenges' of'
conflict, cybersecurity \[and\] transnational organised crime' (PaCCS,
2019). The fact that the lists above vary in their itemisation suggests,
we might plausibly infer, a degree of doubt about which specific issues
should be identified and addressed as forms of'global uncertainty'. The
protean nature of both'global' and'uncertainties' has seemingly allowed
for varying collections of threats and issues to be highlighted as
critical issues. Looking to wider academic analysis, when the
term'global' is invoked in relation to security, a similar degree of
ambiguity and uncertainty tends to persist. Peter Hough's (2013)
Understanding Global Security, for example, for all its merits as a
text, never really presents readers with detailed expla- nation of what
global security is. The chapters of the book, by virtue of their
inclusion, suggests that military threats to states, non-state military
threats, economics, social identity, environ- mental threats, health,
natural disasters, accidents (hazards), and crime should all be grouped
under the heading of'global security'. But, by simply assuming the
term'global security' in its title rather than delving in detail into
what that term might mean, Hough implies by conse- quence that global
security is simply a label that can be used to capture and accumulation
of military and non-military issues. While Hough leaves this
understanding as an unspoken assumption, Charli Carpenter, writing in
the issue that launched the Journal of Global Security Studies, is more
overt in making the case that the study of'global security' is and
should be similarly porous in its terms of reference, declaring that I
would take the perhaps radical position that if it happens on the globe,
and pertains to securing indi- viduals or institutions from threat, it
belongs under the big tent of'global security studies,' even where
the'global' is not the key referent point. (Carpenter, 2016, p. 93) In
one sense it might be argued that there is nothing particularly or
especially problematic about the understandings of global security
proﬀered by Hough and Carpenter. Implicitly, for Hough, and then
explicitly, for Carpenter, the term'global' is being invoked here in the
sense of encompassing the'whole' range of potential security issues and
threats, and with the other common sense of'glo- bal' as a synonym for
worldwide or encompassing the Earth itself as a whole being less
essential or even necessary to this understanding (hence Carpenter's
qualification ' ... even where the"global" is not the key referent
point'). A few issues might arise from such understandings though. The
first is that if used simply to denote a pluralistic and potentially
all-inclusive approach to the study of security, selectivity and
prioritisation necessarily apply to the determination of which threats
and issues are included or excluded under the'big tent' of global
security (studies), just as much as there is a politics to decid- ing
which issues constitute and should be listed as'core global
uncertainties'. The same can be argued even of Joseph Camilleri's (2017)
more refined and extensive account of'the globalization of insecurity'.
While usefully turning attention more explicitly to consideration of the
ways in which a multiplicity of threats-- nuclear weapons, climate
change, pandemics, non-state terrorism -- might be'globalized' in ways
that challenge existing institutional and state-centric frameworks of
governance, Camilleri's account nevertheless still has to grapple with
defining the'global dimen- sions' (2017, p. 24) of those threats as
being at one and the same time'globalised physically and
psychologically' in a manner that, arguably, ultimately ends up
replicating vexed questions of what globalisation in the singular'is'
(cf. Bartelson, 2000; James & Steger, 2014).

Planetary insecurities and the displacement of the global

Wider philosophical and sociological reflections and scholarship on what
can broadly be termed in line with Van Munster and Sylvest (2016) as'the
politics of globality' suggest that even though invoca- tions of the
global may be common and widespread, we should for that reason be
particularly attuned to the scope for divergence rather than convergence
between them. As Paul N. Edwards observes, From this perspective,
globality comes across as an idea, a concept and/or a classic boundary
object: a singular term with multiple meanings which somehow remains
useful and usable for diﬀerent people and groups with varying, even
opposing stakes. You and Donald Trump can discuss the'global econ- omy'
even though your'global' and his are only remotely related \[...\]
Globalities, then, turn out to be a tangled set of messy, contradictory,
often failed or incomplete projects that look very diﬀerent depend- ing
on who you are and where you stand. (2016, pp. 189--190) Understood in
these terms,'the global' and conceptions of it can and should be
historicised within wider socio-political contexts, and'globality'
approached not as a timeless or self-evident condition of things being
or becoming global, but as a ' ... social fact whose basic structure,
genesis, dissemi- nation and subsequent functions can be opened to
historical and sociological inquiry' (Bartelson 2010, p. 231). Building
from the critical approaches outlined above, invocations of
global'uncertainties' , 'chal- lenges' , 'security' and
the'globalization of insecurities' might be scrutinised more closely
with a view to disentangling what kinds of projects they entail and
sustain. In principle, one might argue, there is no reason why this
cannot be a self-reflexive process for those seeking to research 'global
uncertainties' and/or'global security'. Read in its entirety, for
example, Carpenter's outline of how the'future' of global security
studies might evolve does have a necessarily reflective tone in this
respect and suggests a constant need to consider and determine the
nature and terrain of global security (studies). Arising precisely out
of that, though, is a further qualification that ' ... we need to expand
our repertoire of substantive issues beyond the existing"global" (i.e.
international) agenda and think truly globally about planetary security'
(Carpenter, 2016, p. 93, emphases added). Although as noted previously
Carpenter advocates a'big tent' approach to the study of security, here
she makes a more specific distinction between'existing' understandings
of the global as, in essence, a synonym for the international, on the
one hand, distinguishable from a'truly global' cat- egory of planetary
security on the other hand. For the latter she further specifies that
Climate change, ecological security, developments in geo-engineering,
outer space policy, institution- building around asteroid protection,
and governance of the oceans should be at least as relevant to the
security agenda as subjects that \[...\] have dominated security studies
to date: war, diplomacy, great power jockeying, and violence.
(Carpenter, 2016, p. 93) While Carpenter seems to exude a confidence
that global security studies can encompass both 'international'
and'planetary' research agendas, wider debates on and considerations
of'the plane- tary' (cf. Pedersen, 2020) might leave us less certain
that such eﬀorts to collapse and address these within one and the same
category is either possible or desirable (Latour, 2017; Walker, 2010).
Although conceptions of the planetary ostensibly connote a sense of
scope and scale that might be understood as synonymous with'global' in
the sense of being potentially worldwide, a case can be argued for finer
distinctions between understandings and implications of global
uncertainties/challenges/security/insecurities on the one hand and what
might be termed'planetary insecurities' on the other. Indeed, it is in
this sense that notions of'planetary' threat and insecurity might be
conceived not as congruent with'the global' but as actively and
radically'other' to it. Dipesh Chakrabarty, for example, contends that
there is a ' ... growing divergence between the pla- netary and the
global' in distinction to'an established tradition of using the two
words to mean the same thing' (Chakrabarty, 2014, p. 23). Though not
exclusively associated with recent develop- ments-- with, for example,
Herz (1959); Falk (1972) and Deudney (1983) all seeking to articulate
analogous concepts in relation to the study of security-- conceptions of
planetary crisis, insecurity and emergency have become significantly
more prominent in the current academic and wider pol- itical context
(Pedersen, 2020). Revitalising, at a policy level, a concern with what
the Commission on Global Governance (1995) termed as'planetary
(in)security' understood broadly as'threats to the planet's basic life
support systems' (Peoples & Stevens, 2020), concerns surrounding climate
change and its impacts in particular have been the subject of high-level
elite political debates within fora such as the United Nations, and key
subsidiary bodies and expert groups such as the IPCC (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change). Warming of the climate, species depletion and
threats to the habitability of the Earth more generally have also
spurred significant popular protest and mobilisation as most notably
manifest in the Extinction Rebellion and in climate strikes. Such
developments have been informed by and have driven research across
multiple disciplines that suggest a planetary existential and ecological
crisis arising from the detrimental impacts of human life within
the'Anthropocene' (Hamilton et al., 2015; Wallace-Wells, 2019; cf.
Moore, 2016).'Uncertainty' does of course retain a place within such
debates on planetary (in)security (cf. Edwards, 2010) with the precise
nature, causes and conditions of planetary insecurities still debated,
sometimes even in a more hopeful register: the Extinction Rebellion
makes some allow- ance, as does the IPCC, that impending extinction of
life on Earth is not yet (entirely) certain, and that changes in course
can at least mitigate if not entirely avert crisis (see also Klein,
2015). But conceptions of planetary crisis and insecurities are
frequently not as protean as their'global' counterpart outlined above.
Characteristic of notions of'global uncertainty' and'global security' is
a degree of interpretative flexibility and selectivity as to what kinds
of threats are associated with such terminology: witness, again, the
sorts of'checklists' of global uncertainties and insecuri- ties noted
above, and with scope for determining priority areas and locales
dispersed within'the global'. By contrast, conceptions of planetary
(in)security now increasingly identify threats to the existence not only
of human life but all life, in ways that may be related to activities of
the human species, or specific subsets of it, but with eﬀects and
impacts beyond the entirety of human control. Research increasingly
points to and identifies 'planetary' boundaries,'tipping points' and
thresholds beyond which threats exist not only to human life but the
habitability of the Earth itself. The notion of'global uncertainties'
makes some allowance for the perpetuation of security politics and
policy enacted and bounded by nation-states in isolation or in concert,
but in the current con- text and by way of contrast our concern, some
argue, needs now to be primarily focused on the ways in which planetary
boundaries (Steﬀen et al., 2015) -- 'Stratospheric ozone depletion' ,
'Loss of biosphere integrity (biodiversity loss and extinctions)' ,
'Chemical pollution and the release of novel entities' , 'Climate
change' , 'Ocean acidification' , 'Freshwater consumption and the global
hydrological cycle' , 'Land system change' , 'Nitrogen and phosphorous
flows to the biospheres and oceans', and'Atmospheric aerosol loading' --
have been or are likely to be irreversibly crossed (see also Rockstöm &
Klum, 2015; Steﬀen et al., 2018). Such forms of planetary insecurity by
consequence, some argue, constitute a more epochal and endemic form of
crisis that has arguably been countenanced within the study of'the
global' as it has been conventionally understood (Gills, 2020; Hosseini
& Gills, 2020), and are thus fundamentally challenging to existing
disciplinary and conceptual frameworks (cf. Chakrabarty, 2009, 2014,
2018; Pedersen, 2020). A key implication of such forms of planetary
insecurity, Burke et al contend with this exact point in mind, is
that'if the biosphere is collapsing' then ' ... this means that our
funda- mental image of the world must be revolutionised', since'Our
existence is neither international nor global, but planetary' (2016, p.
3; 6). Elsewhere Simon Dalby (2017, p. 235) argues that in the
Anthropocene,'Insecurity is now a geological matter, not a matter of
just biology or ecology in a given set of natural circumstances, but
rather in the new contemporary geophysical processes that are human
actions.' Forms of planetary insecurity, on these readings, oﬀer much
less scope for selectivity as mani- festations of climatic and
ecological crisis unfold, even if some parts of the world and classes of
people seem better placed to try and insulate themselves from or to
ignore such threats. Rather than being something to be accommodated in
tandem, on this view'global security' mappings come to be seen as an
obstacle to be overcome: a'script' that too frequently, in Dalby's view,
comes to be written on to forms of planetary insecurity focusing on, for
example, the ways in which climatic change may or may not increase
incidences of violent conflict. This may in turn obscure the planetary
as it encourages a tendency to try and bound and address issues such as
cli- mate change by securitising them within traditional inter/national
policy frameworks, whereas cli- mate change is itself'chaotic' (Mayer,
2012, p. 166; cf. Fagan, 2017). Chaotic not just in the sense that
climate change is not easily bounded within the conceptual and practical
frameworks of the international or even the global, but also that it
is'nonlinear' in its onset and eﬀects, operative at timescales that are
simultaneously immediate and geological, at one and the same time
subject to modelling and projection but with significant degrees of
uncertainty and unpredictability in terms of how it might unfold in the
future. In this context and for these very reasons, some suggest, the
planetary crisis of the Anthropocene should supersede in priority other
issues that have tended to be identified and associated with
the'globalization of insecurity' (Burke et al., 2016; Harrington, 2016;
Latour, 2017, 2018).

The technopolitics of planetary crisis management

The extent to which forms of planetary insecurity and 'planetarism'
(Pedersen, 2020, p. 7) more broadly might disrupt, challenge and provide
an alternative to ontologies of the national, the international and the
global has as noted above already attracted a significant and growing
degree of scholarly attention. Relatively less well studied, though, are
proposals for and forms of crisis management envisaged in response. The
latter matter and deserve attention as they help fix, in the sense of
stabilising and hypostatising, the meaning and significance of what
'the' current planetary crisis 'is' via a series of proposed
technological fixes to aspects of, or the entirety, of that crisis (see
also Asayama, 2015). As Erik Swyngedouw contends, [our current
'ecological predicament' is 'sutured by]{.underline} millennial fears'
and 'sustained by [**apocalyptic rhetoric** and representational
tactics']{.underline}; but [that]{.underline} same future-oriented'gaze
on tomorrow [permits recasting social, political]{.underline} and other
pressing [issues today as future conditions that can be retroactively
rescripted as a **technomanagerial issue'**]{.underline} (2010, p. 218,
224). As much as [debates on climate change]{.underline} (in particular)
as 'crisis' [are **saturated with visions of existential
threat(s)**]{.underline} partially [manifest in the]{.underline} here
and now but looming with even greater menace in the future (Asayama,
2015, p. 90; Hulme, 2008, pp. 10--11), this has not precluded [eﬀorts
and proposals to contain and manage those threats via technological
means]{.underline}. In fact, as is discussed below, [the more
established]{.underline} that a sense of [planetary crisis has become,
the more]{.underline} that [**experimental technologies** and modes of
**planetary crisis management**]{.underline} that might otherwise be
[**considered 'fantastical'** have come to be **seriously
countenanced.**]{.underline}

With the latter in mind, critical scholarship should, it is argued here,
expand to include evaluation of [the **mode(s) of 'technopolitics'**
that underpin understandings of planetary crisis and proposals for their
mitigation and resolution]{.underline}. The concept of technopolitics,
broadly, denotes 'hybrids of technical systems and political practices
that [produc\[e\] new forms of **power and agency'**]{.underline}
(Edwards & Hecht, 2010, p. 619; see also Hecht, 2011, 2012; Peoples,
2019). Its incorporation allows for analysis of the complex combinations
of technological and political-institutional instruments that have been
proposed as possible ways by which to understand and manage planetary
crises. More than this, studying the technopolitics of planetary crisis
management potentially allows for critical analysis of the
'[**topographies of power'** as embedded within]{.underline} such
proposals when considered and understood as [particular forms of
'**sociotechnical imaginaries'**]{.underline}. As Sheila Jasanoﬀ (2015)
has articulated it, the latter denotes a concern with studying not just
the ways in which the 'social' and the 'technological' are woven
together and related within specific political projects, but also with
how questions and issues of power and justice are consequently
'imagined'. [This is particularly relevant given that the
**technological nature of modern life** has been]{.underline} and is,
many argue, [a **central driving factor** in and identifier of
**anthropogenic change** and its associated forms of **planetary
insecurity**]{.underline}-- the impact of industrialised societies in
terms of carbon dioxide emissions being but one of the most obvious
examples. Technologies also play a crucial role in informing our
understandings of the Earth and human impacts upon it (Masco, 2010), and
as is discussed below some still hold out the possibility that planetary
insecurities can if not be resolved then at least moderated in their
worst eﬀects by technological innovation.

As is crucial to the kind of approach suggested by Edwards, Hecht and
Jasanoﬀ to the study of technopolitics, while some forms of
sociotechnical imaginaries might be more established and durable than
others they all encompass, necessarily, elements of imagination that
relate the past, present and potential futures of sociotechnical
arrangements. [Material **technological and infrastructural
form**s]{.underline} on the one hand-- [and the knowledge and practices
they **produce and sustain**-- are melded with **particular conceptions
of social and political order**]{.underline} on the other; such that,
Jasanoﬀ suggests in reference to wider literatures and approaches within
science and technology studies, [the two are in eﬀect
'coproduced']{.underline} (2015, p. 12; cf. Callon, 2009). How such
coproduction occurs, though, [and]{.underline} how [**relations of
power** are **manifested and distributed** within such
**coproduction**]{.underline}, warrants further investigation for that
precise reason, not least as 'Discrepancies persist in responses to new
and emerging technologies and technological disasters, suggesting that
even earth-shattering events are absorbed and integrated into
preexisting imaginaries in ways that forestall globally homogenous
meaning making and policy formulation' (Jasanoﬀ, 2015, p. 21).

[Exemplifying the above in respect to technologies of planetary crisis
management are]{.underline} space-based satellite infrastructures
(Peoples & Stevens, 2020): crucial to monitoring and determining the
Earth's condition by the provision of Earth Observation (EO) imagery and
remotely sensed data on the one hand (Peoples, 2016); and, on the other
hand, also invoked in controversial proposals to place 'planetary
sunshades' in orbit as a suggested means to oﬀset the worst eﬀects of
global warming and climate change via 'solar geoengineering' (Hamilton,
2014, p. 18; Keith, 2013). Alternative experimental techniques and
proposals (MacMartin et al., 2018, p. 3) include the use of aircraft or
balloons to spray sunlight-reflecting sulphates or other aerosols into
the stratosphere (Crutzen, 2006) in order to supplement the Earth's
existing albedo eﬀect.1 Such proposals for 'Solar Radiation Management'
(SRM) are based around technologies and techniques for 'deliberately
manipulating the earth's temperature without altering the atmospheric
concentration of greenhouse gases' (Barrett, 2014, p. 249). [Novel forms
of carbon capture and storage (**'Carbon Dioxide Removal', or CDR
technologies),** including but not limited to seeding oceans with iron
pellets to create plankton blooms and genetic modification of plants and
trees to absorb more CO2]{.underline}, have also been proﬀered as a
means of 'climatic engineering' (Low, 2017, p. 68; MacMartin et al.,
2018).

[SRM and **CDR technologies**]{.underline} seem to hold, for their
proponents at least, the prospect for mitigating and managing climate
crisis. Others worry, though, that such proposals may [have '**limited
realistic potential'**]{.underline} (EASAC, 2018, p. 1) [for addressing
climate change within the timeframes required, and]{.underline} that
they could unintentionally [**exacerbate crisis** by creating new
environmental problems **if rushed into implementation**]{.underline}
(see, e.g. Crutzen, 2006, p. 212; and compare Robock, 2016; Sillmann et
al., 2015). Proposed forms of solar geoengineering as mentioned above,
for example, are likely to have most impact-- and carry the greatest
potential risks should they fail or have unintended consequences, such
as creating or exacerbating droughts-- for some of the world's poorest
countries located close to the equator such as Ethiopia (Hamilton, 2014,
p. 21). This has led to attendant questions of the extent to which these
countries are being suﬃciently included within the provisional
consideration and formulation of such proposals (see, for example,
Cairns & Stirling, 2014; Winickoﬀ et al., 2015).

[While proposed technologies and techniques of SRM and **CDR** for
managing the climate **remain at the conceptual or early experimental
level**]{.underline}, as Olaf Corry notes insofar as [they already
constitute sociotechnical imaginaries]{.underline} that are [being
explored by]{.underline} particular **[scientific elites]{.underline}**
'climate engineering already exists' (2017, p. 299) as an established
field of research. They are in turn indicative of the wider and more
complex technopolitics of planetary crisis management and-- in relation
to control of the climate in particular-- represent the most recent
iteration of visions for the combination of geo, political and social
engineering (see Hulme, 2008, p. 12). [Within]{.underline} such climatic
and [**geoengineering imaginaries** we]{.underline} ' ... [encounter
**modern forms of expertise'**]{.underline} in a form characteristic of
twentieth century politics and programmes of development and economic
growth [in which an expert-led '**politics of
techno-science**]{.underline} \[...\] [claimed to]{.underline} bring the
expertise of modern engineering, technology, and social science to
[**improve the defects of nature**, to transform peasant agriculture, to
**repair the ills of society, and to fix the economy'**.]{.underline} In
the process, Mitchell (2002:, p. 15) argues, so too did the meaning and
assumed form of the modern economy come to be fixed. Climatic and
geoengineering imaginaries bear interesting comparison in this light and
might even be understood as exemplifying a residual faith in and
iteration of a 'high modernist ideology' (Scott, 1998, p. 4) or, as in
Asayama's direct consideration of geoengineering, as ' ... an excess of
modernity' (2015, p. 92; see also Altvater 140; 151).

Yet there are-- as the political element of the term technopolitics
suggests-- layers of complexity to planetary crisis management, as
exemplified in expert-led debates on climatic and geoengineering science
and technology (cf. Bryant, 2016). While some [**geoengineering
enthusiasts** 'seem to be at home in the world of **technocratic
control'** and embrace the prospect of]{.underline} a controlled climate
[producing a ' ... new Earth by human means']{.underline} (Hamilton,
2014, p. 20; see Keith, 2013), others are much more cautious about the
desirability of [geoengineering and the **models of calculation and
logics** of]{.underline} experimentation [that it could
entail]{.underline}. 'Because it essentially [places the
earth]{.underline} itself [on an experimental stage']{.underline},
Asayama et al argue, ['geoengineering can be seen as a **discourse of
experimentation'**]{.underline} (2017, p. 83, emphasis in original). In
many cases, they note, **[scientists consider geoengineering an
uncertain and 'non-ideal' option]{.underline}**, with general caution
often exhibited towards proposals for 'real world', in vivo (Callon,
2009) geoengineering testing and experimentation but without 'rul\[ing\]
out the possibility of geoengineering [because of their **anxiety**
about catastrophic climate change']{.underline} (Asayama et al., 2017,
p. 83). Similarly, in policy terms Victor et al. (2009, p. 76), though
characterising multiple proposed geoengineering techniques and
technologies as a 'last resort', countenance a scenario in which, within
' ... a few decades, the option of geoengineering could look less ugly
for some countries than unchecked climate change'. The possibility of
'climatic disaster', they contend, leads ultimately to the
recommendation that

> It is time to take geoengineering out of the closet-- to better
> control the risk of unilateral action and also to know the costs and
> consequences of its use so that the nations of the world can
> collectively decide to raise the shield if they think the planet needs
> it. (Victor et al., 2009, p. 76)

The Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric scientist Paul J. Crutzen has
similarly argued that, precisely because existing structures of
international governance have not been suﬃcient to keep the warming of
the planet under control, research into the feasibility and
environmental consequences of stratospheric sulphur injections or other
comparable forms of albedo enhancement ' ... should not be tabooed'
(Crutzen, 2006, p. 214).

In such proposals and visions, a pattern consequently recurs: 'ugly' and
'taboo' though it might otherwise be considered, [the **intensification
of climatic crisis** is argued to require **reconsideration** of
geoengineering]{.underline} in order to 'shield' an overheating planet.
In this sense, [bound up in the **technopolitics** of contemporary
understandings of **planetary crisis and insecurity**, are not only
fears but also hopes for human technological civilisation and with
**consequent implications** for understandings for the **scope of human
power and agency** as well as issues of **social justice**.
**Technologies** are often presented as having the capacity to threaten
but also the power **to' save ' and' secure** ']{.underline} (Peoples,
2019), at one and the same time [portending and commingling '**utopic'
and 'dystopic' visions of the future**]{.underline} (Jasanoﬀ, 2015). The
European Academies Science Advisory Council's assessment is particularly
worth noting in respect of this aspect, rejecting as it does the
possibility that technologies capable of removing CO2 from the
atmosphere are a 'silver bullet' solution to climate crisis (EASAC,
2018, p. iv). Although it makes some allowance that such technologies
could have a contribution to make, the report is also situated within an
overarching concern that:

> [One factor]{.underline} possibly [contributing to a **lack of
> urgency**]{.underline} \[in meeting the targets of the 2015 Paris/COP
> 21 Agreement\] [may be the belief that]{.underline} somehow
> "[technology" will come to the rescue]{.underline} \[...\] If such
> technologies are seen [as a **potential fail-safe or backup

> expectation on such technologies could thus have irreversibly damaging
> consequences on future generations in the event of them failing to
> deliver. This would be a moral hazard which would be the antithesis of
> sustainable development. (EASAC, 2018, p. iv)

This 'moral hazard' argument-- broadly, the concern that [proposals
for]{.underline} and development of **[geoengineering
technologies]{.underline}** and techniques might [**undermine** a
fundamental **need to curb** greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}-- is
widely noted within debates of geoengineering and climate change (see,
for example: Barrett, 2014, pp. 254--255; Horton & Reynolds, 2016, pp.
442--443; Victor et al., 2009, p. 68; Zürn & Schäfer, 2013, p. 272).
[Even those]{.underline} assessments that are more [positively disposed
towards geoengineering]{.underline} tend to acknowledge and [invoke the
**moral hazard argument**, with]{.underline} a common and
[concurrent]{.underline} tendency to articulate [arguments
for]{.underline} geoengineering research and development as
['**Reluctant Geoengineering':**]{.underline}

> ... [a Plan B]{.underline}-- that is, a fallback [or **second-best
> option**]{.underline} rather than as a preferred option or replacement
> for mitigation \[...\] 'reluctant' in that [climate engineering is
> advanced in a '**worth a try'** style of argumentation
> that]{.underline} tends not to [**hide uncertainties and
> (environmental) risks**.]{.underline} (Corry, 2017, p. 299)

The EASAC assessment cited above stands out in this respect not least
because of the way it places 'technology' in inverted commas, which
immediately indicates wariness towards [the risks of]{.underline} even
residual [**technological optimism** and of assuming a **literal Deus ex
Machina** in the]{.underline} context of [climatic crisis]{.underline}.
Yet, it [should be noted]{.underline}, with an increasing trend towards
framing the current context not only [as]{.underline} 'crisis' but as'
emergency' (Markusson et al., 2014), [**the sociotechnical imagination
of geoengineered futures**-- and]{.underline} their accompanying
[**technopolitical** architectures and infrastructures of
**governance**-- are being given greater consideration]{.underline},
including within the contours of already established debates in global
governance and global studies (cf. Horton, 2015). There, particular
attention is paid to questions of how to govern and regulate
geoengineering in such a way as to control for the risk of states (or
private actors) 'unilaterally' deploying forms of geoengineering (see,
for example, Barrett, 2014; Horton & Reynolds, 2016; Lloyd &
Oppenheimer, 2014; Zürn & Schäfer, 2013).

### L---Green Extractivism

#### The 1AC's project of green extractivism extends necropolitical control over the Arctic through dispossession and destruction of indigenous lands that produces green sacrifice zones, whereby exposure to death becomes a necessary tactic of neocolonial conquest. 

**Kröger et al. 24** (Ksenija Hanaček, Post-doctoral Fellow at
Autonomous University of Barcelona; Markus Kröger, Professor of Global
Development Studies at the University of Helsinki; Joan Martinez-Alier,
Emeritus Professor of the Institute of Environmental Science and
Technology at Autonomous University of Barcelona; 2021; "Green and
climate colonialities: Evidence from Arctic Extractivisms", Journal of
Political Ecology 31(1), 538--566. doi:
https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.5512) -- Langham EY

[Policymakers, mainly in the Global North, have been implementing new
green growth strategies or Green New Deals. The narrative of
sustainability and development behind these policies relies on
ecological modernization ideology, whose proponents do not question
growth]{.underline} (Wilson, 2013). According to them, these [tactics
promise more sustainable industrialization and downscaling of critical
emissions]{.underline} (Chuffart et al., 2021; Dunlap & Riquito, 2023;
Zografos, 2022; Zografos & Robbins, 2020). [Such strategies create
opportunities for national and transnational companies to develop
so-called sustainable mining for transition minerals, battery-
grid-electrification complexes with major low carbon infrastructural
expansion, large scale hydroelectricity projects, industrial wind power
or large-scale solar power projects]{.underline} in the global South and
North (Avila, 2018; Dunlap & Laratte, 2022; Zografos, 2022). However,
these approaches focus on the addition of new sources of energy and
materials, rather than their full substitution. Coal production
continues to increase (Roy & Schaffartzik, 2021; York & Bell, 2019), not
least in the Arctic (Savin et al., 2021). Even nuclear energy and
natural gas are seen as two of the solutions to meet net zero targets on
the decarbonization journey (IEA, 2022; Kemfert et al., 2022; Namaganda
et al., 2023). Nonetheless, nuclear or natural gas-powered projects also
face opposition (Temper et al., 2020).

[The term \"green extractivism\" is related]{.underline} conceptually
not only to studies (particularly after about 2015) that analyze
conflicts around so-called transition minerals for electrification
(Dunlap, 2017), but also [to the critique of the so-called bioeconomy
and conflicts and policies to replace fossil fuels]{.underline}, dating
back to the 2000s (Gudynas & Acosta, 2011). Flex crops (such as sugar
cane or palm oil) and \'flex trees\' led to increased cultivation and
extraction for agrofuels, feed, and fiber, facilitated by land grabbing.
These \"green\" plantation expansions perpetuated social inequality and
environmental destruction (Borras et al., 2016; Dorn et al., 2022;
Kröger, 2011, 2016b). We consider green extractivism as a subset of
extractivism, with those activities under the green economy including
more than the bioeconomy (Levidow, 2014). Hence, green extractivism does
not simply relate to forests and agriculture. The current conversation
about green extractivism and the climate crisis focuses on windfarms,
solar, battery complexes, and mining the metals needed for all of these.
Thus, extractivism manifests itself in many forms and degrees, with
diverse effects and consequences (Kröger, 2022a: 47). [**Green
extractivism fuels capitalist expansion through so-called sustainable
development policies**, with implications for international and national
legal and political frameworks. These **policies** jeopardize social,
ecological, and political realities, and **create \"green sacrifice
zones\" in which certain lives exposed to contamination are regarded as
having less value than others**]{.underline} (Mejia-Muñoz & Babidge,
2023; Zografos, 2022).

[Green extractivism arises in the name of climate change mitigation or
green economic \'\'development\'\']{.underline} (Dunlap & Riquito,
2023). Green extractivism is therefore a process, and in addition to
flex crops, may include bioplastics, carbon offsets (e.g. REDD+)
(Kröger, 2016b), transition mineral mining and related infrastructure
and transportation services (Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Bruna, 2022). The
term \"green\" added to extractivism has, however, typically little to
do with sustainability and solutions to the climate crisis (Zografos,
2022). [**Green extractivism** often **causes** interrelated
socio-environmental pressures through **overexploitation of socio-
ecological territories**, including their culture, spirituality,
lifeways, food and customs, and social relations in general]{.underline}
(Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Jerez et al., 2021).
Thus, extractive \"green\" processes have typically neocolonialist
characteristics in the Global South (Acosta, 2011; Hughes et al., 2023;
Jerez et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019). They also appear within the immediate
semi-peripheries of the Global North, such as the Arctic (Hanaček et
al., 2022).

In biophysical terms, [**extractivist economies** depend on the
extraction of energy and materials, and **generate waste**]{.underline}
(Georgescu-Roegen, 1971; Martinez-Alier, 2022). [In social terms,
control, access, and use of natural resources, disproportionate **toxic
pollution**, and climate impacts are typically part of this process.
There are also intersectional proc**esses of \"Othering\", violence, and
death brought about by the creation and abuse of social divisions**,
along the lines of gender, class, race, sexual orientation, caste, and
cultures]{.underline} (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Batalla, 2020; Pulido
& De Lara, 2018; Tran & Hanaček, 2023). [We identify such processes in
varieties of extractivism aiming to achieve a carbon-free future, and to
slow the climate emergency \"ticking clock\"]{.underline} (Bruna, 2022;
Clark, 2021).

Activists and academics have highlighted how [\"green\" opportunities
are not a solution to this crisis, but rather a continuation of
extractivism**. Green extractivism**, despite its name, still relies on
intense material extraction]{.underline} (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022;
Dunlap, 2018, 2021; Jerez et al., 2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022).
In theory it promotes sustainable development and prosperity for all,
but [in practice **turns into** **intolerable** levels of hardship **for
Indigenous Peoples**, fisher, and peasant communities]{.underline}
(Akbulut et al., 2019). In what follows, we argue that [**the extension
of green sacrifice zones**, as well as the new consensus surrounding the
decarbonization path, **can be seen as an expansion of commodity and
waste frontiers**]{.underline} (Martinez-Alier, 2023), [building on
historical patterns of colonialism and extractivism.]{.underline}

Del Bene and colleagues (2018) argued that \"renewable\" energy
hydropower projects are associated with the oppression of those who
oppose them though protest, undermining diverse epistemologies and world
views. Meanwhile, [industrial wind and solar power **development**
projects shape uneven land conflicts]{.underline} (Avila et al., 2022),
occasionally [**involving** **occupation and militarization of local
territories and displacement of populations**. In some documented
instances there have been **assassinations of activists**]{.underline}
(Dunlap, 2018; Dunlap & Fairhead, 2014; Fanari, 2021; Tran & Hanaček,
2023).

[The **mining** of green transition minerals have also **brought**
environmental, social, and economic **harms**]{.underline} (Jerez et
al., 2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). Minerals and metals
identified as critical to the development of four key green energy
technologies---solar, wind, electric vehicles and energy storage---are
listed by Church and Crawford (2020).2 They include aluminum, cadmium,
chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, lithium, manganese, molybdenum,
nickel, rare earths, selenium, palladium, silicon, silver, zinc, etc.
Some are newer transition metals (Dunlap & Laratte, 2022). [The **rush
for rare earths** includes various attempts to extract the minerals from
the ocean floor or submarine hydrothermal deposits]{.underline} (Glasby,
2002; Levin et al., 2020). [Smelters and tailings continue to **expose
local communities to toxicity**]{.underline} (Dunlap & Jakobsen, 2020).
We find empirical evidence across Latin America, South-East Asia,
Eastern Europe, and the African continent (Núñez et al., 2022; Siti et
al., 2022; Sovacool et al., 2020; Zografos, 2022).

**[As the ice across the Arctic recedes, infrastructure-related projects
are on the rise]{.underline}** (Hildyard & Sol, 2017). For example, the
Polar Silk Road, part of China\'s Belt and Road Initiative, involves
expanding local economic partnerships through investments in major
infrastructure, nuclear powered icebreakers, and other extractive
projects along the Northern Sea Route (Tillman et al., 2018).3 The start
of the war in Ukraine saw an increase in trade along the route (Silk
Road Briefing, 2023). This Northeast Passage across Russian Arctic
waters is currently usable only for a few months, and requires suitable
vessels due to floating ice (Kröger, 2023). In the next decade however,
even a \"low-carbon\" global climate model predicts warming and melting
of the ice (Kim et al., 2023). The route could reduce by 40% the
distance between Northwest-European ports and the Far East, compared to
the Suez Canal route (Kovalenko et al., 2018). There is also a railroad
in the planning stage to link southern Finland to the Arctic Ocean,
passing through reindeer herding territories (Junka-Aikio, 2023). [**But
what of the \'\'gradual elimination\'\' of local cultures and
livelihoods in these** **necropolitical \'\'death-dealing
assemblages\'\'**]{.underline} (Truscello 2020: 6; Dunlap & Laratte,
2022)?

[**Climate colonialism is** also **based on this logic of
necropolitics**]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Mahony & Endfield, 2018;
Sultana, 2022). Imperial and colonial processes shape climate questions,
and have been widely recognized in the literature (Dunlap, 2020;
Kallianos, Dunlap & Dalakoglou, 2022). Meanwhile, [**erasure of
Indigenous knowledge, imperial climate infrastructure visions, and
extraction** are the most common features shaping the
socio-environmental and political characteristics of a
place]{.underline} (Locher & Fressoz, 2012; Mercer & Simpson, 2023).
[The current climate crisis highlights the importance of understanding
colonialism]{.underline} (coloniality) [and reacting to the undesirable
situation that perpetuates it through \"green\"
extractivism]{.underline} (Bhambra & Newell, 2023; Dorn et al., 2022). A
recent publication by Vela Almeida et al. (2023) indicates that the
European Green New Deal not only provides opportunities for greater
profit, but also buttresses the imperial power structure, leaving little
space for anti-colonial ecologies. Altogether, [ongoing developments in
the Arctic region, such as gas, nuclear, wind, hydropower and the new
transition mineral rush in the wake of climate change]{.underline}
(Boersma & Losz, 2018; Össbo, 2023), [as well as resistance to such
projects]{.underline} (Hanaček et al., 2022) illustrate climate
colonialities and \"green\" extractivisms, from old to new (Gritsenko,
2018; Sultana, 2022).

Academics including geographers, journalists, activists, [Indigenous and
non-Indigenous people, as well as **Knowledge Keepers in the Arctic**,
have increasingly **agreed that** climate change and the **low-carbon
transition projects reproduce colonial attitudes.**]{.underline} Such
attitudes also impose non-stop structural blindness about ontological,
epistemological, and axiological struggles on the ground (Cameron, 2012;
Lassila, 2020; Normann, 2021).

In this context, [significant **colonial dimensions of climate change in
the Arctic are massive expansion of the extractive, industrial, and
shipping sectors**]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012), [**including those
emerging from \"green\"** sustainable **development**
promotions]{.underline} (Gritsenko, 2018; Len, 2021). Acknowledging not
only colonial history and ongoing colonial effects of such extractive
projects but also resistances against multiple imperial and colonial
\'\'shades of green\'\' (Carminero-Santangelo, 2014), are important for
critical examination of these interrelated dynamics. Huggan (2016)
explains that [**colonial aspects in the Arctic context continue through
economic, geopolitical, epistemic dominance by the nation states and
transnational companies.** These aspects are incorporated into
ideologies of modernization, green development and progress that rely on
Arctic resources. **Colonialism**, thus, continues to **shape** debates

informing contested visions for its future]{.underline} (Sörlin et al.,
2022).

### L---Ice

#### The 1AC's investment into scientific knowledge of production of Arctic ice is an attempt to the save the white world from its own calamity through the extrapolation of indigenous knowledge as a geologic resource for Western domination. 

**Smith 20** (Jen Rose Smith, assistant professor of geography at the
University of Washington; 2020; ""Exceeding Beringia": Upending
universal human events and wayward transits in Arctic spaces";
https://doi.org/10.1177/0263775820950745) -- Langham EY

While interest in ice has erupted in a current moment of rapid climate
change, ice---and **[Arctic ice]{.underline}** in particular---[has long
been a **focal point of study for scientific knowledge production** and
has held a **key** foothold in **imperial Western cultural
imagination**]{.underline} (Blum, 2019; Dodds, 2018; Wilson, 2003).
[**Scholars have critiqued representation** and reportage **of ice**
**as** blank, **barren**, and empty, or ice as essentially
**ahistorical** and disconnected from ongoing socialities]{.underline}
(Bravo, 2018; Davidson, 2005; Grace, 2001). [A range of work has
intervened to rewrite the **Arctic** as an important ecological
ecosystem]{.underline} (Bravo and Rees, 2006), [as a **space where white
masculinity and nationalism is tested**]{.underline} (Bloom, 1993;
Robinson, 2006), [either verified or foiled]{.underline} (Craciun,
2016), [and as a geopolitical zone that defies bureaucratic clarity as
neither land nor water]{.underline} (Steinberg et al., 2015).

The Arctic has also been writ as a space of historical human activity,
in particular in regard to archaeological research that aims to evidence
large-scale theories of human migrations through the Arctic to other
climes, largely in exit from Africa or East Asia (Graf and Buvit, 2017;
Turnbull, 2010). [**Material scientific data** have long been
**extracted from the Arctic**]{.underline} (Bravo and Sorlin, 2002),
[and continues in contemporary forms such as through **ice-core
technologies**]{.underline} (Antonello and Carey, 2017; Elzinga, 2017),
[as well as **drone imagery** and **satellite data** that track ice
melt.]{.underline} While much Arctic scholarship attends to Western
presences, more recent work offers a fuller inclusion of longstanding
Indigenous histories and ongoing politics (Banerjee, 2012; Cameron,
2015; Cruikshank, 2006; Huntington et al., 2019; Routledge, 2018; Stuhl,
2016). Often these contributions arrive in the form of assessing
traditional ecological knowledge, Indigenous mapping, or examining
literary narrations (Aporta et al., 2014; Bennett et al., 2016; Kollin,
2001; Krupnik et al., 2010).

These transdisciplinary contributions of ice-analytics offer a
characterization of ice as a materiality that is uneasily categorized by
perceptions of the colonial or theoretical: ice does not produce
agriculture, it does not give root, it does not generate arborescence,
it is not rhizomatic. Ice is a conundrum across academic disciplines; it
confounds an aesthetic determinacy through lens or by brush. Immensity
of glacier and icefield remains an artistic puzzle and representational
bane (Balog, 2012; Bloom and Glasberg, 2011). Ice is slow and plodding
as it shifts, breaks, melts, and hardens, though scholars and artists
often dramatize its precarity. Within dominant conversations of the
Anthropocene, ice is made a focal point as its melting is a danger to a
temperate world.

The crisis of climate change animating Anthropocene discourse is
explicit and straight-forward: human-made environmental destruction is
immediately identifiable. Yet, [many analytical offerings of the
Anthropocene are inadequate as they authorize a universal truth of how
the Arctic must be known, depicted, and managed. **Dominant Anthropocene
discussions are constituted by three overlapping formations.**
**First**, as a **Science** that **works to "save humanity" from a
self-induced catastrophic crisis**]{.underline} (Chakrabarty, 2009).
[**Second**, as a **bureaucracy** that works to **attend** fully **to
claims of sovereignty by** primarily **colonial nation-states** and
secondarily, if at all, to Indigenous polities]{.underline} (Shadian,
2014; Zellen, 2008, 2009). [And **third**, through a **liberal
multiculturalism** that allows for multi-dimensional aesthetic
portrayals of the Arctic to exist simultaneously and equally. Within the
latter is a niche **narration of Indigenous peoples as apolitical** and
often ahistorical, **repeating tropes that herald alternative qualities
of uninterrupted Indigenous lifeways within Arctic spaces.** This
**inclusion of "the alternative" articulates Arctic Indigenous peoples
not as** so many **autonomous** sovereign polities, **but as a potential
resource of land-based knowledges that can recover a global "we" from
self-inflicted destruction.** Within this capitulation, **the death of a
white**, temperate **planet might be salvaged by** an orchestrated
**return of a set of once subjugated knowledges.**]{.underline}

The Anthropocene as the (unofficial) latest geologic epoch (Crutzen,
2002) has been roundly problematized (Baldwin and Erickson, 2020; Fagan,
2019; Ojeda et al., 2020; Simpson, 2020; Tsing et al., 2017; Tuana,
2019; Verges, 2017; Yusoff, 2019). [Scholars critique the colonial,
racist foundations of the Anthropocene discourse and call for careful
interrogations of which sets of humanity must be held accountable for
capitalist activities that contribute most to a changing
climate.]{.underline} Franc¸iose Verges (2017) puts it most succinctly
writing that [the Anthropocene is an easy story to tell, "because it
does not challenge the naturalized inequalities, alienation, and
violence inscribed in modernity's strategic relations of power and
production."]{.underline} Bringing attention to the white supremacist
and anti-black underpinnings of the Anthropocene, Verges invokes a more
apt term "racial capitalocene" to assess the current state of the world.

#### The 1AC transforms Arctic ice into militarized data and universal climate narratives that erase Indigenous epistemologies to justify extraction. These scientific and strategic justifications enable colonial governance that sacrifices Indigenous life for geopolitical and environmental control.

Pg 389-391

This form of mapping the Arctic is from on high, using vegetation
indicators to carve the surface of the Arctic into segments, while other
more [modern mappings foreground a colonial desire to track, measure and
develop detailed volumetric knowledge about Arctic ice, land and sea
(Cameron 2015). Surface, aerial, space-based and volumetric mapping work
together as well, further attempting to render legible the horizontal
and vertical space of the Arctic and its ice (on subterranean aesthetics
and mapping, Hawkins, 2020). Measuring ice by volume adds deeper
colonial scientific dimensions to knowing, occupying and extracting from
the Arctic. Academic disciplines such as glaciology and permafrost
science were integral to this shift away from and building on surface
level measurements of ice]{.underline} (and associated methods such as
repeat photography) [to a focus on ice cores and the volume and depth of
the cryosphere]{.underline}. As Sorlin and Isberg (2021) remind us, [ice
coring not only transformed the social and material landscapes of
Greenland into a site of considerable scientific and strategic interest
but also transformed the epistemological and material significance of
ice (Alley, 2014; Cosgrove, 2008).]{.underline} As ice cores from
Greenland and Antarctica are transported and archived in overseas
locations, the temporal relationship to scientific research of ice and
the data it contains allows for a new form of reconstruction of past
environments and climates. Interpreting the chemical makeup of two mile
long ice cores extracted from ice sheets creates particular apertures of
mediated past climates to emerge. In one sense, then, [ice core science
created the conditions of possibility for universal narratives about the
history of the Earth to take shape and inform a climate-catastrophe
modernity.]{.underline} While local fieldwork was consequential in terms
of access to ice, often through the pres- ence of militarised access and
partnership, the portability of material ice enabled scientific networks
to extend and transform (O\'Reilly, 2016 and see the essays in Dodds &
Sörlin, 2002). We offer a reading of Arctic ice and its dynamic
relationship to narratives about Arctic geopolitics and futures. We take
up and engage with a growing body of literature falling within what
might be called ice humanities (for example, Bloom & Glasberg, 2011;
Bravo, 2019; Bravo, 2017; Bravo & Rees, 2006; Carey, 2007; Carey, 2010;
Dodds, 2019; Dodds & Sörlin, 2002 Ruiz et al., 2019; Smith, 2021;
Sorlin, 2015). The most recent and rising scholarly turn to ice has
parallels with ocean geogra- phies and critical ocean studies (Steinberg
& Peters 2015; Deloughrey, 2019; Jue, 2020) in the sense that both
strands of writings have drawn impetus from feminist, Indigenous and
post-colonial epistemologies, more-than-human ontologies, Anthropogenic
change such as acidification and elemental state-change, and finally a
turn towards more explicitly immersive and volumetric conceptions of
space that emphasise depth, height, forces and composition (see the
essays in Billé, 2020). The shared impetus for so much of this work has
been a collective misgiving about the over-emphasis given to either
legal-strategic-military gram- mars and zonation (for example, exclusive
economic zones, outer continental shelf delimitation, sea lanes of
communication, shipping lanes) and/or a relentless focus on fundamental
state-change such as melting, thawing and acidification, which contin-
ues to posit the Arctic as a natural region, being relentlessly depleted
of ice, snow and coldness. [In the case of the Arctic Ocean, sea ice
decline coupled with ocean warming has enabled new scientific framing
devices such as 'Atlantification' to gain traction as a way of
accounting for the open-ended, bio-geochemical and non-linear shifts
occurring in the substance and circulation of polar waters. In other
ways, the 'Arctic' becomes less Arctic because it cannot prevent the
loss of its ice and as a consequence is now being absorbed by a dominant
agency---Atlantification.]{.underline}

2 \| FROM 'NATURAL REGION' TO ICE CORE AND NOW 'ATLANTIFICATION' As
scholars of the Arctic have noted, a dominant discursive formation which
continues to frame the Arctic as a circumpolar region is one
characterised by reference to cold climate and frozen environment (for
example, Bloom,

1993; Grace, 2000). For the last 15 years, there has been a steady
production of articles, books, documentaries and films purporting to
track and trace transformations of the changing Arctic. [There has been
a relentless quest to identify a 'New Arctic', which is characterised by
excessive change to ice, ocean and air (for instance, Evengård et al.,
2015). Physical change is held responsible for stimulat- ing more
extraction, more mobility and more governance.]{.underline} What gets
lost in these sweeping overviews are two fundamental things. First, as
Ruiz et al. (2019) note, is '[Making sense of ice \[and we would add
land, ocean, air\] is not just a material, but involves ideas rooted
across past, present, and future socio-cultural contexts and
environmental experiences' (Ruiz et al., 2019, p. 8). The role of ice in
the human history of the Arctic varies in meaning and significance; so
making sense of loss will itself reveal different ontologies and
epistemologies]{.underline} (Gearheard et al., 2013). Second, the power
of story-telling remains profoundly asymmetric. [Recent calls for
research into the 'Arctic Anthropocene' reveal yet again a fondness for
thinking of the polar regions as 'laboratories' for non-polar audiences
to extract, observe and process from afar]{.underline} (for example,
Finger, 2016). Indigenous and northern communities have been telling
their own stories for millennia but still have to fight to be heard in a
region that so often has been framed by outsiders as a blank,
people-less void. [As volumetric ice became 'quantifiable data' it
encouraged conversation across disciplines such as climatology and
ocean- ography (Elzinga, 2017). Ice core research became less about the
localised extraction of ice from ice sheets and instead was rendered
data to be interpreted as global climate information and planetary
story-telling]{.underline}. Thus, climate modelling in the 1960s and
1970s made the Arctic 'global' and trans-national far before the term
was being used as a shorthand to describe the grow- ing interest from
Asian countries in Arctic geopolitics and governance (Sorlin & Lajus,
2014; Woon & Dodds, 2020). The cryosphere became in short 'portable', in
ways that earlier maps and forms of aesthetic media had previously
provided, such as through early photographs, paintings and drawings of
glaciers and icefields by early colonial explorers, travellers and
tourists to northern spaces. While ice had been considered portable,
even pocket size through a photograph or drawing, the technology of ice
coring and the infrastructure built to keep ice cores frozen created a
new terrain of the volumetric space of ice and the data it contains
(Antonello & Carey, 2017). [Ice data became part and parcel of
computerised climate modelling, intra-proxy envi- ronmental research
(for example, pollen, tree rings), and geo-chronological analyses of
human and non-human climate forcing]{.underline} (Cosgrove, 2008;
Achermann, 2020). In addition to the ice core, there has been no
shortage of endeavors to document the Arctic\'s frozen earth and sea
ice, ranging from nineteenth century Russian surveying of permafrost in
eastern Siberia to elaborate monitoring of drifting sea ice during the
International Geophysical Year (1957--8). While these exercises were
informed by scientific labouring, both permafrost and sea ice attracted
an array of other stakeholders, including engineers and industrialists
(Brunn, 2020). These scientific stakeholders were charged with planning
Russian and then Soviet agricultural and industrial development on the
one hand. On the other hand, Soviet and American military planners were
desperate to better understand the sea ice dynamics of the Arctic Ocean.
Submarine operations during the Cold War depended in large part on
having an up-to-date compendium of data on sea ice distribution and
thickness (Roberts, 2015). [One main intent of such mapping projects was
to create knowledge sets about ice as a dynamic, transitional
materiality that could either help or hinder movements of military and
capital, buoying or tanking colonial nation-state financial
interests]{.underline}. What links nineteenth century Russian
exploration of eastern Siberia and mid-twentieth century sea ice mapping
is a sense that the Arctic\'s cold qualities were sufficiently enduring
to necessitate academic, financial and infrastructural investigation and
investment (Herzberg et al., 2018). Such was the scale and extent of
frozen ground in Russia and sea ice in the Arctic Ocean that the Arctic
could be routinely framed as a place of frustration due to the
unruliness of ice in complicating Euro-Western exploration,
exploitation, industrial development and trade, as well as acting as a
buffer and at times barrier to the shrinking of space--time as movements
of capital are enacted (Chu, 2020). As research connects the global
cryosphere to debates about the Anthropocene, the affordances provided
by Arctic and Antarctic ice became increasingly recognised and
celebrated as integral to seasonal regularity, shaping the wider benefit
to the earth\'s (human) inhabitants that have come to depend upon it
since the Little Ice Age. As scholars of ice have noted, the last 150
years have been extraordinarily dependent on relationships and
entanglements with artificial and natural frozen water (Dodds, 2018;
Heidbrink, 2020). In the nineteenth century a global ice trade
flourished involving the extraction and transporta- tion of Arctic
glacial, river and lake ice that connected, for example, Alaska to
California and Norway to the United Kingdom. These global movements also
demonstrate [the role of ice in fulfilling the need of certain
racialised bodies to 'keep cool' in tropical geographies, which signals
and shapes oppressive interfaces between colonial actors and Indigenous
peoples, between the metropole and the colony (Hobart, 2022). In this
way, ice can act as both a deterrent to movements of empire and coloni-
alism in the Arctic and Antarctic while also demonstrating aesthetics of
colonial comfort of ice as a comestible transported from the
hinterlands.]{.underline} [If tropical heat is disorienting, and ice a
mediating factor in providing stability and comfort for temperate bodies
and agents of colonialism, here]{.underline}

[ice can be understood as a buffer]{.underline}, something that George
Orwell reflected upon in his ruminations about life in colonial Burma,
entitled Burmese Days (Orwell, 1934). In the twentieth century,
scientific interest in the Arctic, especially the island of Greenland,
grew markedly as climate research began to shift its attention away from
natural variability towards the perturbative role of human agency. The
Arctic proved itself to be strategically significant to
colonial-capitalist militaristic endeavours and initiatives during World
War II and the appropriately named Cold War. What connects the three
developments is [the role and value of ice: as commodity, as locat- able
and portable scientific object, as substance that challenged
conventional military tactics and domain awareness.]{.underline}
Simulta- neously, civil-military resourcing could also enable the
material presence of scientific stations dedicated to ice coring and ice
surveying in the Arctic and Antarctic[. Domain awareness was not
restricted to land, sea and air. Going 'underground' had its advantages;
scientists were eager to discover more about what lay underneath ice
sheets and glaciers while militaries experi- mented with plans to hide
infrastructure including missile installations under those same ice
bodies. The toxic remains of such military projects and plans are easily
found across Arctic spaces.]{.underline} As the ice harvester, the
scientist and the soldier/naval officer quickly discovered what
Indigenous people have already long known and experienced, ice is highly
dynamic, shape-shifting and capable of frustrating, blocking and
resisting human designs. As Michael Bravo has alerted us, there is a
cryo-politics to all of this (Bravo, 2017). In this moment of late
modernity, however[, the Arctic now comes to matter differently on the
main stage and through the main stream. Now, scholars, scientists,
activists and journalists report that there is too little ice, too much
glacial retreat, and insufficient frozen terrain (Balog, 2012). Ice is
no longer performing as a reliable buffer---containing subsurface carbon
stores, reflecting heat, and preserving the frigidity of polar waters.
Nor is ice performing as a constant or consistent barrier.]{.underline}
Whereas earlier dominant refrains regarding the Arctic discussed it as
an obstacle, if anything useful to comment upon at all, now Arctic ice
as it drastically transforms shape and viscosity receives more press
than ever. If the Arctic was largely ignored and over- looked in
previous eras of the Western master narrative, in dominant discourse
now, the Arctic in part constitutes what it means to be a human being in
a moment of late-stage capitalism. As Morehouse and Cigliano (2020)
report, glacial funerals are now being held in Iceland as a way of
marking disappearance and persistent sea ice loss is credited as
ushering into existence a 'new Arctic' (on the 'new Arctic', see
Serreze, 2018). Morehouse and Cigliano (2020) suggest that the public
mourning of glacial disappearance operates as an opportunity to think of
ice as animate rather than inanimate, an idea similar to Cruickshank\'s
detailing of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Eyak philosophies pertaining to
glacial sentience, and the long held belief that glaciers are social
actors that change physical, social and spiritual landscapes. [This is a
loss that cannot be adequately captured by metrics such as ice melt and
surface area exposure but something that speaks to the connections
between ice and the life-worlds of others.]{.underline} In her account
of life on either side of the Bering Strait, Bathsheba Demuth reminds us
of how sea ice is lively, animate and life-affirming. As she notes: In
forming, thawing and shifting under the wind, ice steadies the
circulation of the world\'s oceans, making them hospitable for living
things ... The sea ice shapes being, human and otherwise, on this
planet. From its groaning surface, the world as we know it is made
(Demuth, 2019, pp. 21--36) Here Demuth\'s attunement to [the necessity
of ice is understood as relational, symbiotic and mutualistic in its
crucial func- tioning. It works, in sympathy, with the other accounts
that consider Indigenous life-worlds and the meaning of ice in shaping
the lives of the peoples of the Arctic]{.underline} (Gearheard et al.,
2013).

#### The innovation from the aff plan continues forms of the geo-logic from colonial capitalism, reinscribing forms of violence from the belief that the human knows best

[Contemporary infrastructures of environmental technologies and Earth
observation systems are deeply imbued with the exigencies of colonial
capitalism and its military-scientific institutions.
T]{.underline}ogether they provided the technological knowledge,
expertise, and the high-risk capital necessary for investing in
scientific and technical innovations on which colonial knowledge and
domination were built.13 Starting with Napoleon's Expeditions to Egypt
(1798--1801), new measuring instruments,

communication networks, and scientific methods (chronometer, telegraph,
observatories) gradually transformed the Mediterranean into a site of
ongoing scientific observation, "a living laboratory,"14 where critical
information about extreme weather patterns, disease, crop productivity,
and desertification could be generated and mobilized for grand
agricultural and climate engineering designs.15 These experiments were
decisive for the emerging geographies of European imperialism.

It enabled those with the greatest technological advantage and military
might to reallocate vital Earth resources and to construct a global
world space in which previously separate biotas and raw materials could
be flexibly mixed, circulated, and reassembled into new geological
formations and natural habitats.16 [As Yusoff observes, "the afterlives
of these geomorphic acts constitute the materiality of the]{.underline}

[Anthropocene and its natal moment"---from the transformation of the
mineralogy of the earth through the extraction of gold, silver, salt,
and copper to the massive transformation of ecologies as a result of
transplanting people, animals, and plants]{.underline}.17

The construction of the Suez Canal (1859--1869) marks a pivotal moment
in this succession of techno-natural incursions. It transformed the
Mediterranean from a closed lake into a central corridor between Asia,
Africa, and Europe, paving the way for ever larger parts of non-European
lands to come under European control.18 At the same time, it opened the
sea to traveling species from Asia and the Indo-Pacific region, ushering
in the biggest migration of marine life to date.19 Connecting the
Mediterranean with the Red Sea had long been a utopian dream, but also a
tremendous challenge, because there was a 10-meter difference in sea
levels between the two.20 It took several failed attempts before the
project could be brought to fruition, further fueling its symbolic
resonance as a token of Western ingenuity and technological mastery. As
Valeska Huber recalls, the canal was envisioned as a crucial segment in
the expansion of European civilization by way of modern transport and
communication.21 Three hundred years later, this universalizing promise
manifests itself in rising sea levels, temperature increases, toxic
algae concentrations, and oil spills that are threatening the survival
of entire coastlines, cities, and the marine ecosystem from the
Mediterranean to the South China Sea.

More than half of the one thousand known "non-indigenous species" (NIS)
currently inhabiting the aquatic space connecting Libya, Italy, Greece,
Turkey, and the Levant have entered via Suez, putting severe pressures
on the genetic function and structure of local habitats.22 They often
multiply with extraordinary speed and overconsume or outcompete
indigenous forms for space, food, and other

vital resources.23 Rising sea temperatures and global warming further
accelerate these pressures, because tropical forms tend to thrive in
warm waters, whereas local specimens and plants, which are already
exhausted by industrial pollution and rising temperatures, are further
weakened. Added to that comes the rapid increase in shipping traffic
following the extension of the canal in 2014. Around

17,000 ships pass through Suez each year, moving tons of ballast water
full of biological materials---including plants, animals, viruses, and
bacteria---from place to place. Globally it is estimated that some ten
thousand species circulate across the world this way at any moment,24
changing oxygen levels, food chains, and other life-sustaining processes
in local marine habitats.25 In some instances,

it was science itself that contributed to the spread of notorious biota.
The "killer algae" Caulerpa taxifolia, for example, was initially
imported to the Institute of Oceanography in Monaco for study purposes,
but it quickly escaped into the Ligurian Sea through discharge pipes
from the circulating seawater system, brushing aside relationships
formed among Mediterranean plants and animals

over tens of thousands of years.26

[The precarious condition of the Mediterranean gives vivid testimony of
the destructive impact of techno-scientific experiments and innovations
on the "geo-logic" of the Earth system]{.underline}.27 It created a
political ecology of trans-species relations in which the toxic agential
powers of waste, climate effects, and pollutants fold into evolutionary
principles to become an integral feature of geological strata, climates,
the Earth atmosphere, and biomass[. Following Yusoff, I am using
"geologic" here to denote how humans not only affect geology but are an
intemperate force within it]{.underline}.28 [As Yusoff notes, "As
geological agents, humans are explicitly located alongside other Earth
and extraterrestrial forces that possess the power of extinction and
planetary effect as a direct result of their ability to capitalize on
and incorporate geological forces, making previous fossilizations such
as oil, minerals or coal their own."]{.underline}29 This immersion of
human activity into geological strata and metabolic cycles fundamentally
challenges some of the core ontological assumptions on which modern
biopolitics traditionally relied.30 It extends the governance of life
and death into an environmental condition with the result that received
boundaries and distinctions between nature and society, life and
nonlife, bios and geos, which have been characteristic for
modern-colonial government, lose their ontological grounds. As Lehman
remarks, the question of securing certain forms of life can no longer be
confined to the figure of the human, but rather "needs to respond to
planetary-scale environmental conditions, not as a predictable baseline
but as a source of potentiality that cannot be easily mapped or
known."31 To put it another way, [as the folded temporalities of
industrial pollution, aerosol, and CO2 dispersion intermingle with
biological and geological holds, long-standing assumption of what
constitutes life, and the forces and conditions that sustain it become
ever more difficult to ascertain, just as the time frames and the
conditions of its ending are becoming ever more contested and
unclear.]{.underline}

Against this horizon of uncertainty about risks and their "knowability,"
new logics of governance emerge that draw together diverse sets of
knowledge and technologies that have never been in the purview of the
biopolitical calculation, i.e., oceanography, atmospheric chemistry,
Earth system science, or hydrography.32 [Combined with the speculative
calculus of machine learning and big data analytics they conjure
post-human ontologies of governing life and death within and across
geo/biological strata, where previously fixed indicators for measuring
health, security, or mortality are opened to recombinant correlations of
variables stretched across vastly different time frames and
scales.]{.underline}33 Health today is as much a function of aerosol
dispersion, rising sea temperatures, CO2 emissions as it is a measure of
access to vaccination and physical health care. These environmental
qualities, Anderson suggests, demand a calculus of life and death quite
different from the classical biopolitical imagination. Such a calculus
can no longer rely on fixed variables known in advance, but rather it
needs to account for unpredictable and emergent phenomena that are
"potentially catastrophic and capable of altering the conditions of
possibility for life across scales."34

[Such a reading of governance as heterogenous assemblage of human and
nonhuman actors and agencies calls for a more expansive notion of
"multipolar innovation"]{.underline}---one that includes the
multiplicity of substances, energies, objects, and materials implicated
in the disruptive impact of technological inventions and scientific
novelties. [Satellite imaging and sensor technologies have introduced a
whole new range of methods and means for observing metabolic life cycles
through the medium of electromagnetic waves that fundamentally change
how the fluid boundaries and transitions between life, death, and
nonlife are interrogated, measured, and understood]{.underline}. Thanks
to machine sensing and vision, scientists are now able to observe layers
of biological and geological activity on the level of the microbial and
the subatomic that have never been in the purview of human perception
and imagination, opening up new ways of responding to the invisible
effects of human-induced violence on a planetary scale. Yet this
extended field of sensibilities also raises new ethical challenges. It
begs the question: Where do we need to look and how do we need to see to
account for deaths and risks of extinction? If the primary basis of our
knowledge and relation with the world and with others is no longer
confined to the primacy of direct vison and contact, but always already
mediated through machine sensors and data proxies, where then do we
situate the agency of decision making that is needed to ensure that
technical affordances operate in the service of collective betterment
and the well-being of all

### L---Law

#### Legal institutions produce zones of nonbeing, whereupon racialized populations drafted onto a lower scale of humanity are rendered proximate to death.

On Law, Racialised Bodies, Coloniality, and this Enduring Necropolitical
Space

[One of the ways this system is produced and maintained is through the
existence/creation of racial-gender categories]{.underline}, for
example, but also particularly. [These categories produce the life-death
dichotomy that marks the necropolitics of a world perpetually suffused
in colonial thinking and ways of doing.]{.underline} Notably Gilmore
defines [**racism** as "the state-sanctioned or extralegal production
and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability to premature
death". ]{.underline} This definition recognises the structural effects
of racialisation as well as the entrenchment of state-power (and thus
law) in race's emergence as category and reproduction as harm/privilege.
In other words, **[being artificially drafted into a contrived but
materially effective lower scale of humanity systemically places those
so drafted closer to death.]{.underline}** The counterpoint is also
true---[th**ose drafted into the higher scale of humanity are placed
further away from vulnerability to premature death.** In the
**constitution of the human-subject in law**]{.underline}---and the
subject's relationship to bordered space---**[legal knowledge reproduces
differential proximities to death.]{.underline}** So, it is suggested
that the colonial difference in conceptualisation of, for example,
Wynter's 'Man', may attempt to be diluted by inclusive representation,
but [unless entirely dismantled, this **colonial difference is
structurally self-reproductive.** **The legal concept of the human is
already contingent on artificed categorisation, thus representation
still operates on the norms of the system**]{.underline}---[new norms
are needed for new systems that will not produce proximity to death for
more and more people.]{.underline}

One would think that this conundrum should be unpacked as a matter of
course within legal education. Closer attention should be paid within it
to the actual social-historical construction of this human subject
beyond its presumption as a biological organism. However, this is not
usually the case. In contrast with the legal person, the human, the
human body and their (mis)uses are under-theorised as legal
agents/topics within the main corpus of legal knowledge. It is often
difficult for our students to see why justice remains a forlorn hope and
despair a standard. One way we can unpack this dilemma in class and in
our work, is an examination of necropolitics, especially when understood
as a derivative of Foucauldian biopolitics.

Foucault, in his reflections on the concept of biopolitics, was
concerned with the functional and legitimated power of the sovereign to
regulate the life of the legitimate population.  So, he describes the
population as to the sovereign a political, scientific, and biological
problem.  Thus, questions of law and governance manifest themselves in
multifaceted modes of control. The law is necessary to control all
spheres of life---housing, education, health, work, order, etc. Foucault
recognises this as an extension of logics from the battlefield into the
domestic sphere---an effective reduction of human interaction to
appearing only in the starkness of either death or life. On the
battlefield, the living soldier is fighting for the sovereign; the
dead/wounded soldier has no impact on the war. By extending this
death/life frame to civil "peacetime", the concern of the sovereign in
the domestic sphere is reduced to only the same concerns that pervade
the warscape---some will live, and some will die. Bodies become merely
functional -- our fears, feelings, emotions, needs, wants and desires
have no relevance to the goals of the state. The civil warscape is the
economy---the accumulation of capital. The goals of the state are its
maintenance. Citizens either contribute to the economy or they are
dead/dying. There is no in-between space. Some will die.

Expanding on Foucault's biopolitical thesis, Mbembé introduces
"necropolitics"---sovereign death-power. He asserts, that "[**the
ultimate expression of sovereignty** largely **resides in the power and
capacity to dictate who is able to live and who must
die**]{.underline}".  Mbembé's treatise recognises the limits of a
biopolitical analysis that fails to account for extreme situations that
arise therein where "[life was not so much being governed, as much as
**death** itself was being **sanctioned**]{.underline}". [**The survival
of necropolitical spheres as such is contingent on death being**, not
just a possible outcome, but the definite outcome for certain members of
its population.]{.underline} Some must die. It should be noted then,
that the logics of Foucauldian biopolitics are not divorced from
necropolitical orders but exacerbated within them. [In the biopolis, for
survival of the sovereign-economy, the death of some is possible, while
**in the necropolis, the death of some is inevitable.** **Some. MUST.
Die.**]{.underline}

Mbembé describes **[the necropolis as emerging through]{.underline}**
"**[the generalized instrumentalization of human existence and the
material destruction of human bodies and populations]{.underline}**".
Thus, [**this unfolding destruction began with identifying populations
who are marked "must die"**, and can be found in the **colonial matrix
of power'**s appropriation-led **creation of "zones of non-being"**
**predicated on gendered racialisation.**  In regulation in response to
the global pandemic, in enduring racial injustice, in disproportionate
vulnerability to the violence of climate change, in the maintenance of
apartheid zones]{.underline}---**[some have been labelled "must die" for
the survival of colonialism's power.]{.underline}** And so, [this
process continues with the overexploitation of appropriated and
commodified land as well as the enclosure of unfree labour, the
untrammelled extraction of resources, and their entrapment behind and
within colonially devised borders.]{.underline} In essence, both
Foucault and Mbembé recognise structural or state-sanctioned racism as
not just one example of sovereign death-power, but THE example. Legal
education's narrow boundaries have been unable to describe this
continuum and so the hopes of students seeking liberation within them
are often dashed.

### L---Maritime

#### Ice melt is recast as economic potential through geopolitical discourse and cryopolitics, constructing the Arctic as a "New North" defined by profitable northern sea routes and expanding maritime economies. Language/discourse sustains this narrative, framing shipping routes as pathways for oil and gas transport feeding southern markets---turning Arctic transformation into a sacrificial zone for global trade and resource access.

#### Huggan and Jensen 16 (Dr. Graham Huggan, Chair of Commonwealth and Postcolonial Literatures at University of Leeds; Dr. Lars Jensen, Associate Professor at Roskilde University, both Ph.D. holders, 2016, Introduction, "Unscrambling the Arctic," Postcolonial Perspectives on the European High North: Unscrambling the Arctic, Palgrave Macmillan, DOI 10.1057/978-1-137-58817-3_1, https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-58817-3_1, TA)

Pg 5-10

For some time now, geopolitics has been the predominant lens through
which an ongoing history of colonial relations has been looked at in the
Arctic, an area which, seen in broad geopolitical terms, remains one of
the most consistently exploited on Earth. At one level, it makes perfect
sense to see the Arctic this way insofar as it constitutes a "region of
peripheries \[that\] comprises more or less remote portions of seven
countries: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the
United States." 22 "The Arctic" is generally defined from without;
indeed, much like "Asia" the term may make little sense to those who
actually live there other than as a strategic means of asserting
regional solidarity or leveraging central government support (Huggan
2015 [). The language of geopolitics con- structs the Arctic as an
object of national and international concern, often centering on global
security issues. It therefore seems worth asking to what extent
geopolitics contributes to the colonial scenarios---both past and
present---it dissects, even if more recent, critically reflexive
geopolitical perspectives on the Arctic have shifted to
considering]{.underline} the security, environmental and otherwise, of
Arctic peoples themselves.

The work of the Cambridge-based polar researchers Michael Bravo and
Gareth Rees is exemplary for this particular kind of critical
geopolitics, which focuses on a changing Arctic but interrogates the
deterministic discourses that are regularly mapped onto it by political
scientists and other designated Arctic experts, several of whom have
recently taken to describing the Arctic---whose future is now almost
axiomatically seen as being crucial for the health of the planet---as
having become subject to ecological "state change" (Borgerson 2008 ;
Bravo 2014 ; Dodds 2010 ; Young 2009 ; Zellen 2009 ). [Such discourses,
Bravo and Rees imply, risk reinscribing the Arctic as an object of
western knowledge: knowledge that is derived from science and
technology, refracted though the modernising rhetoric of international
relations, and seconded to ideologies of progress that openly assert
global imperatives but tacitly assume western norms and principles of
politico-economic development and social change.]{.underline} Such
knowledge arguably infl icts what the postcolonial theorist Gayatri
Chakravorty Spivak ( 1988 ) might call a kind of "epistemic violence" on
the Arctic that overrides local understandings in the broader geopoliti-
cal interest of repositioning the region within a hyper-competitive glo-
balised world. Certainly, it tends to undervalue the experience of the
Inuit and other Arctic indigenous peoples, whose role in coming to terms
with a changing Arctic is crucial, and whose situated knowledge and
knowl- edge systems are not necessarily compatible with western
paradigms---if not necessarily incompatible either, as romanticised
models of indigenous resistance suggest (Banerjee 2012 ).

Bravo and Rees' more particular emphasis is on what they call "cryo-
politics": the reassessment of ice as a central feature within
geopolitical discourse about the Arctic. [Cryo-politics goes far beyond
scientific calculations of retreating ice coverage and its implications
for new navigable sea routes through the Arctic; rather, its main aim is
to interrogate the "unwarranted environmental determinism" that is
currently being used to gauge Arctic politics at a time of accelerated
climate change. 23 An underly- ing objective is to reaffirm the
inherently flexible nature of maritime space in accordance with
Christian Brünner and Alexander Soucek's revisionist defi nition of the
Arctic as "a maritime space surrounded by land which has been inhabited
by people for thousands of years and which belongs to sovereign
countries."]{.underline} 24

Interpreting the Arctic as maritime space arguably requires a different
kind of vocabulary and approach, a different geopolitical apparatus, to
that applied to solid landforms---and a different one again insofar as
Arctic maritime environments frequently offer a shifting combination of
land and water encapsulated in that most materially volatile and
conceptually pre- INTRODUCTION: UNSCRAMBLING THE ARCTIC 7 carious of
physical elements, sea ice. As Satya Savitzky among others has pointed
out, the liminal status of sea ice, which is neither fully water nor
wholly land, presents considerable diffi culties for international
maritime law, not least in terms of adjudicating sovereignty claims.
This has resulted in the coexistence of two competing theories of ice
law in which ice is either seen as land, and therefore claimable as
sovereign territory, or as water, and therefore subject to the freedom
of the seas (Savitzky 2013 ; see also Oude et al. 2001 ). 25

All of this has ramifications for any attempt to understand histories of
colonialism, and current processes of decolonisation, in the Arctic.
[More specifically, Bravo and Rees' emphasis on the complex navigability
of Arctic space suggests an urgent need to unscramble the Arctic. This
entails wresting it away from its persistent status as a fi xed object
of western con- trol and knowledge, and reasserting the value of those
micro-histories of Arctic space and territory (e.g., those surrounding
Wrangel and Hans Islands) that complicate western universalising
narratives of technological progress, politico-economic development, and
ecological "state change]{.underline}."

Unscrambling the Arctic potentially involves at least three overlapping
ele- ments, each implicitly bound up in a decolonising politics. [First,
unscram- bling the Arctic works towards depolarising it as a licence for
"end-is-nigh" alarmism and "get-rich-quick" opportunism: the twin
frontier logics that underlie contemporary confi gurations of the "New
North"]{.underline} (see section 2 below). 26 Second, unscrambling the
Arctic implicitly desecuritises it as a largely defunct military zone, a
parody of its former Cold War self, even as it recognises that a variety
of Arctic stakeholders---both indigenous and not, and often operating
with different motives---will continue to debate the region "around
issues of environmental security, food security, and human rights." 27 ,
28 Third, unscrambling the Arctic effectively deterritori- alises it,
not so much in the literal as in the fi gural sense of reimagining it as
an ontologically plural and fundamentally unstable, although by no means
uninterpretable or unnavigable, space. It would be naïve to imagine that
unscrambling the Arctic in this way would reverse the processes that
inform [the current "scramble for the Arctic": a popular if by no means
entirely inappropriate catchphrase which tends gleefully to batten onto
contemporary media-driven percep- tions of the heightened importance of
the region as a strategic resource base]{.underline} (Craciun 2009 ;
Dodds and Nuttall 2016 ; Howard 2009 ; Sale and Potapov 2010 ). Rather,
it suggests that the "scramble for the Arctic" might itself be in need
of unscrambling, not just to reveal the confl icting 8 G. HUGGAN
messages embedded within it, but also to challenge the utopian languages
of Arctic commonality and consent that are increasingly ranged against
it. This confl ictual space includes the heady view that the Arctic has
moved into a post-Cold-War era of non-governmentally determined
transnational cooperation (Young 2005 , 2009 ), or defensive rejoinders
of the kind that cite "the \[surprising\] absence of jurisdictional
confl ict" in the region or assert, contrary to populist understandings,
that "there is no 'scramble' on the part of \[the major Arctic\] coastal
states." 29 Unscrambling the Arctic does not entail denying the
existence of a "cooperative" alongside a "competitive" Arctic; rather,
it seeks to decon- struct the binary opposition between them, and to
challenge the polarised geopolitical rhetoric that gave rise to the
opposition in the fi rst place---a rhetoric that also underlies more
recent articulations of ecological "state change" (Bravo 2014 ).
Unscrambling the Arctic stresses the need to exercise acute vigilance
towards those dominant languages, both scholarly and popular, that have
done much to frame colonialist representations of the Arctic. It also
entails a critique of expert opinion on what should be done with the
region, and a revisiting of the question of how to determine the major
interpretative patterns through which Arctic peoples and prac- tices are
currently understood (Ryall et al. 2010 ). [The humanities have a key
role to play here, both in showing how language produces the realities
it purports to describe and in positing imaginative counter-narratives
of the Arctic that either implicitly complicate or explicitly challenge
the unexamined presentism, as well as speculative fervour, of current
social- scientifi c accounts (Ryall et al. 2010 ; see also Bravo 2014
).]{.underline} Some of these latter provocatively assert that the
Arctic, and the High North it some- times metonymically represents, has
entered a radically new phase, both environmentally defi ned (climate
change) and economically reoriented (Nordic affl uence); a few go
further, suggesting that this new phase might sketch a model for the
world to come. Such accounts are less scientifi c analyses, perhaps,
than an excitable kind of punditry on the Arctic, and it is to this
punditry, defi ned in part by its obsession with newness as well as its
weakness for neologism, that I now turn.

NEOPHYTES AND NEOLOGISTS: INTERROGATING THE "NEW NORTH"

Let me begin, as I did in the last section, by dealing in turn with two
very different examples, Laurence C. Smith's The New North ( 2012 ) and
Alun Anderson's After the Ice ( 2009 ): both well-written books aimed at
a gen- INTRODUCTION: UNSCRAMBLING THE ARCTIC 9 eral readership, and both
designed at least in part to capture the volatile atmosphere, as well as
the changing strategic importance, of the High North. The premise of
Smith's vivid thought experiment, which projects the world forward to
2050, is to ask whether mounting global pressures might cause new
societies to emerge in places that might otherwise seem to be
unappealing, even unamenable, to human settlement. The provi- sional
answer it gives is that it is the northern geographic regions that will
assume an exponentially higher strategic value, and correspondingly
greater economic importance, than they have today. 30 The scene is set
for Smith's "New North," which he envisions in terms of "all land and
oceans lying 45 \[degrees north\] or higher currently held by the United
States, Canada, Iceland, Greenland (Denmark), Norway, Sweden, Finland,
and Russia," 31 an economically rather than geographically defi ned
region he also dubs, with a sly nod to its profi t-indexed Pacifi c
counterpart, the "Northern Rim." The ascent of the North, Smith
suggests, owes to the pressures brought about by chronic overpopulation
and the increased demand for natural resources it entails.

The Arctic---less clearly defi ned---belongs to this "New North," but as
a periphery of it, and Smith conforms to populist understandings of the
Arctic as a globally connected space, but also one that is paradoxi-
cally "cut off from the rest of the world." [32 Smith is less enamoured
of the populist rhetoric of "scramble," which he briefl y
invokes---intensifying resource wars, the dismal prospect of
remilitarisation, and so on---only to turn his back on it, siding
instead with Young and others in seeing the Arctic as having entered a
new era of fruitful cooperation---a coopera- tive spirit which has
persisted, he says, "despite \[all\] the hype about mad scrambles and
looming Arctic wars." 33 Instead, he suggests, the stage is set for
another kind of carve-up from which the Northern Rim countries (he uses
the unfortunate acronym NORCs) stand massively to gain---not least from
the much-anticipated new northern seaways that will spring up to feed an
already hungry Arctic maritime economy, allowing ships to gorge in situ
on northern oil and gas, then turn around and carry it to eagerly
waiting markets in the south. 34]{.underline}

This vision of plenty, hyperbolic in its turn, is backed up by the
cheerful view of Northern Rim cities, despite their cold winters,
ranking "among the world's happiest places to live." 35 This is only
likely to continue, Smith suggests, as "against a global backdrop of
rising material wealth, envi- ronmental stress, and total human
population \[...\] smaller, fl ourishing cultures \[are set to grow\]
amid the milder winters and abundant natural resources packed into the
northern quarters of the planet." 36 The Arctic 10 G. HUGGAN belongs to
this clement vision, though Smith implicitly critiques stereo- typical
views of "a place \[once\] perceived as a maritime graveyard and killer
of men \[and\] now perceived as dissolving into a frontier ocean, laden
with natural-resource riches for the taking." He furthermore pointedly
adds that such contrapuntal images have been "fi rmly cemented into pub-
lic consciousness" precisely because there "are so few actual Arctic
resi- dents around to protest these frames." 37

[Smith notably fails, however, to enquire what might become of these
peripheral residents of the "New North," or to ponder the implications
of those new geographies of poverty---within as well as between
regions--- that have recently arisen under the conditions of
globalisation. The geog- raphy of poverty invokes a different kind of
scramble, not so much the scramble for profit as the scramble to survive
(Bravo 2014 ; see also Klare 2013 ).]{.underline} Anderson's account,
while it has problems of its own, certainly cannot be accused of
overlooking this. More interested than Smith in see- ing the Arctic as a
region in its own right, Anderson nonetheless admits that this region
has been discursively fashioned by outsiders---"the scien- tists who
study it, the politicians who want to control it, \[and\] the oilmen who
\[seek\] to exploit it"---rather than by "those \[diverse\] indigenous
peo- ple who call it home." [38 He tries to counteract this objectifying
tendency by spending time with the local (Canadian) Inuit. But he only
fi nds that, despite surface confi dence in the future, histories of
"colonial paternal- ism" 39 are being replayed in the poor living
conditions, and overall lack of economic opportunities, to which many
Arctic indigenous communities are currently being subjected. They are
also replayed in the government- sponsored dependency that keeps Inuit
and other northern indigenous peoples locked in "a state of financial
and emotional despair."]{.underline}

#### The Maritime navigation of the aff propagates the forms of biopolitics on the seas where powerful sovereigns are given a state of exception to choose who is accepted and who is rejected on the high seas

I develop three arguments regarding these maritime (and, more
specifically, ship) spaces and their relations to terrestrial space.
First, in each we see that [maritime spaces not only have their own
dramas and material histories, but those dramas and histories take
highly biopolitical forms:]{.underline} the history of the ocean is a
history of biopolitical exceptions. I draw upon Michel Foucault and
Giorgio Agamben's conceptions of biopower (a power that brings
biological life into the political and juridical realm)

alongside Agamben and Carl Schmitt's ideas of exceptional spaces (spaces
at the limit point between the juridical and the extra or non-juridical,
included within the purview of power only through its exclusion).
[Maritime travel, an originating and limiting condition for
globalization, occurs in a boundary space wherein the norms of
state-sovereignty can be suspended and the management of populations and
bodies becomes unmistakably, and intensely, biopolitical]{.underline}.
Foucault exposes this exceptional marine logic in a discussion of the
Renaissance Narrenschiff, the Ship of Fools through which the mad were
cast out from the space of cities: aboard ship the mad had no prison
other than the threshold itself....\[They were\] placed on the inside of
the outside, or vice versa....\[The mad were\] prisoner\[s\] in the
midst of ultimate freedom, on the most open road of all, chained solidly
to the infinite crossroads\...passenger\[s\] par excellence, the
prisoner\[s\] of the passage. (Madness 11) Standing at the threshold
between freedom and capture, [maritime passengers and crews enter a
space that has a liminal relationship with landed society, a space in
which they can alternately be captured and abandoned by more normal
political and social order]{.underline}s. Ocean spaces exist outside of
any single state's control, implying that in ocean geographies the
biopolitical relationship between sovereign power and individual subject
becomes malleable and even atrophied.

Carl Schmitt demonstrates that, unlike the "firm land," the "free seas"
were viewed historically as existing "outside any specific state spatial
order\...free of any type of state spatial sovereignty" from the period
of the sixteenth century onwards (Nomos of the Earth 172). Within
maritime space "the sharp distinction between state and individual,
public and private, even between war and peace, and war and piracy,
disappeared" (Nomos of the Earth 174). This belief at first stemmed from
a classical appeal to the elemental nature of an ocean that, as one
sixteenth-century legal theorist held, "can be neither seized nor
inclosed; nay, rather possesses the earth than is by it possessed"
(Grotius 37); with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, this elemental freedom
became systematic and juridical (Nomos of the Earth 181). The freedom of
the seas was most recently upheld---with a few modifications regarding
territorial waters---by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (LOCS): Part VII reads that "the high seas are open to all
States" ("Article 87") and that "no state may validly purport to subject
any part of the high seas to its sovereignty" ("Article 89").
[Concurrent with this freedom, ships have historically]{.underline} (as
in naval, slave and immigrant vessels) [operated as camp-like spaces
with a captain-sovereign wielding nearly absolute power over ship, crew
and cargo.]{.underline} Further, as they traverse the globe ships come
up against multiple sovereign territories that may seize hold in
multiple ways. [Understood as exceptional spaces outside of national
boundaries, the global seas act as the obverse of landed society, as
spaces ripe for the emergence of biopolitical technologies and networks
of biopower,]{.underline}

[rather than as the empty spaces they have been considered]{.underline}.

I want to note here that my focus on biopower and the logic of
exception----rather than economics, race, gender, international
relations or any of the other processes and modes of power at work
within ocean spaces----stands in danger of reducing multiple maritime
histories to a single, monolithic logic of biopolitical operations, and
rendering complex and historically contingent stories into a single
narrative. By bringing together three radically disparate ship spaces
under a logic of biopower, I run the risk of occluding the multiple
practices of power that are at work in each. While I understand that
other

ways of viewing these spaces exist, that other narratives could be
constructed, I have made biopower the centre of my study because, in
these three cases, those other formations of power seem to find
expression in biopolitical ways; the control and management of bodies,
if not the sole or essential type of power at work in each space,
functions as a kind of stain that bleeds into other forms of power: in
each of these spaces, but most noticeably in the slave and migrant
ships, the control of bodies and

populations----whether through economic, imperial, medical or other
forms of power----can be understood as a primary goal. I hope that the
more nuanced critiques of each space in the following chapters will
compensate for any veering into an overly black and white
conceptualization in this Introduction.

S[econd, not only are these spaces biopolitical,4 but they are
excessively so]{.underline}; in the exceptional space of ships, th[e
operations of biopower diffuse out of sovereign control, out of the
governmental regimes of a single nation, into multinational and
non-sovereign domains]{.underline}. Within the exceptional space of the
sea, these ships become less subject to the sovereign power of
nation-states, while still subtended by the controlling tendrils of
national, international and extra-national forces, implicated in larger
networks composed of multiple sovereign powers, transnational movements
of labour and capital, and global

systems of communication and representation. N[ew forms of sovereign
power emerge in this space that serve non-state economic systems more
than state-based politics]{.underline} (Schmitt, Nomos of the Earth
294). More than anything, the seas act as a contact zone for cultures,
histories, nations, economic processes, technologies, private industry
and corporate exploration and exploitation. [Maritime space is best
understood as a plural space, a "geography of multiple seas\...that do
not naturalize a single epic logic]{.underline}" (Easterling 70) but
rather create multiple, contentious, logics that bump against each
other: t[he]{.underline}

[biopolitical space of the seas is a space where frictio]{.underline}n5,
rather than smooth efficiency, rules. [Even a single ship can be home to
multiple, contested spaces]{.underline}, as Foucault points out in his
1976 essay on heterotopias: these "other spaces" juxtapose any number of
real places, which in maritime space can include prisons, churches,
markets, factories, hospitals, houses, schools, and so on. The ship,
Foucault maintains, is "the heterotopia ar excellence" ("Other Spaces"
27). In the case of the Komagata Maru, for example, we have a
Japanese-owned ship transporting Indian immigrants to the Dominion of
Canada from a number of East-Asian ports; the stakeholders in this
incident included at the very

least different levels of imperial and national government in Canada,
England, the United States of America and India; Indian migrants already
in Canada; factory and logging- concession owners hungry for workers;
the racist "White Canada" movement; immigration officers and lawyers;
and the migrants themselves, as well as thousands of other British
subjects eager to migrate. Through the [ships that float on these
multiple seas we can see a proliferation of biopolitical mechanisms and
exceptional states created by a number of invested parties.]{.underline}

Finally, [I want to suggest that the sea occupies a necessary and
integral position vis-a-vis the landed spaces of
nation-states.]{.underline} That is, my study reveals a complicity
between land-based, territorializing sovereign powers and the
deterritorializing biopolitical practices borne by the oceans: [maritime
exceptions function as a hidden supplement of (Western) law and order;
the suspension of law at sea is integral to the rule of law on
land.]{.underline} This is most evident in earlier historical moments,
when the

distinction between terra firma and mare liberum was more dramatic;
after the discovery of the Americas, the whole of the New World was
considered part of the maritime space of exception, existing beyond the
amity lines delineating where European "treaties, peace and friendship
applied" (Schmitt, "The Land" 32-33). The law and order of European
nations, and the health of national populations, were supplemented by
the abeyance of law in the Americas. As the land appropriation of the
colonial process took place, the order of law was gradually imposed upon
these spaces and the free seas again became the major space of
exception. Contemporary spaces such as Guantánamo Bay and the islands of
Australia's "Pacific Solution" fulfill a similar function as exceptional
spaces brought

within the juridical system of national and international law only
through their legal exclusion, spaces whose existence is supposed to
somehow decrease risks to the communal bodies on land.

[The liminality of oceans is maximized in various ways to maintain the
health of populations and nations on land, providing means to interdict
those populations and bodies deemed inferior or harmful, to grant entry
to those seen as beneficial, to destroy those viewed as threatening, and
to transport the various goods required by national
populations.]{.underline} In a very real way, [landed society requires
the world's seascapes, as sites in which determinations regarding which
bodies can and cannot qualify for political rights or social meaning are
made]{.underline}

### L---Military Infrastructure

#### The 1AC's development of military infrastructure in the Arctic is imbricated with legacies of waste colonialism that render Inuit lands as zones of toxicity and environmental degradation. This is constitutive of settler geologies that render indigenous land and futures as mere sites of extraction.

There is a historical link between resource extraction, ongoing settler
colonialism, and waste in Canada's Arctic that continues into the
present day and underpins the political landscape and ongoing waste
issues in Nunavut today. This thesis, Relationship to the Land (Use
Planning Provisions): Mapping the Limitations of the Settler Imagination
in an Arctic Anthropocene, argues that [**settler** conceptions of land
and **geology** are **foundational to colonization** in Nunavut and that
**Inuit**, their rights, **communities**, and futures, have been
**conflated with resource extraction by settler-colonial governments**
and institutions.]{.underline} Importantly, waste from resource
extraction is a major component of the complex waste issues in Nunavut
as a territory and cannot be understood without this broader analysis.

This thesis project is situated within Canada\'s Northern Waste Future:
Colonial Legacies, Contemporary Development, and Future Opportunities, a
SSHRC Insight Development funded research project exploring how settler
colonialism has shaped waste in Canada's Arctic, with Dr. Myra Hird as
the primary investigator. [The **Arctic landscape** is **littered with**
caches of **waste**, predominantly **from abandoned military and
industrial sites**]{.underline} (Hird & Zahara, 2017). **[Military
waste]{.underline}** (much of it highly toxic) [has **accumulated in the
Arctic since the 1940s**]{.underline} (Hird, 2016) and waste from
approximately "twenty-seven thousand abandoned or "orphaned" mines in
Canada, most of which are in Canada's northern regions" (Hird & Zahara,
2017: 128). Extraction and colonialism are connected to unique waste
management challenges Canadian Arctic communities face that are
exasperated by the geology, climate, small population, and lack of
infrastructure (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017: 3).
[Resulting **waste management practices**, such as open burning at
dumpsites, **put** human and **environmental wellbeing at
risk**]{.underline} (ibid: 3). [As environmental pressures in a warming
Arctic accelerate, understanding these extractive and toxic legacies and
their effects is critical.]{.underline}

While municipal solid waste (MSW) is frequently discussed as a pressing
problem, [**waste from military** and industrial **origin**
is]{.underline} much more **[prolific]{.underline}** -- [particularly
**in the Arctic** where successive governments have attempted to scale
resource development, leaving behind waste material]{.underline} (Hird,
2021). [The prospect of a warming Arctic, with less sea ice to inhibit
ship traffic, has only intensified the move toward resource
development]{.underline} (ibid: 101). [Adequate remediation of mining
sites poses huge challenges in remote Arctic areas, where waste
materials cannot easily be removed. For example:]{.underline}

> [**Canada's Giant Mine**, located in the Northwest Territories,
> **produced** some **237,000 tons of** arsenic trioxide
> dust]{.underline} -- [a **highly toxic** form of
> **arsenic**]{.underline} -- [as a by-product of gold
> mining.]{.underline} The plan, so far, is to re-stratify the waste in
> the mine itself, using the frozen-block method to freeze this highly
> toxic waste in perpetuity for a future generation of engineers,
> scientists, politicians, and publics to resolve. [The plan for the
> Giant Mine, then, is effectively a permutation of our current
> dependence on landfills in which the intention is that these
> infathomable tons of waste be kept in place: not leaking, not
> exploding, not combusting, not flowing beyond the boundaries we have
> imposed.]{.underline} (Hird, 2021: 168)

The plan for the Giant Mine only extends 50 years into the future and is
underpinned by a belief that the waste material will stay stagnantly
encased. Dr. Joan Kuyek (2011) argues that sites like the Giant Mine
require perpetual care for thousands of years, and the maintenance must
be planned from the start. However, [in the current push for **expanded
Arctic extraction, environmental** **concerns** are regularly **pushed
aside** and comprehensive plans for perpetual care are
absent.]{.underline} While the Baffinland Mary River mine on Baffin
Island has been the site of ongoing concerns around waste rock
management (Dusen, 2016), invasive species introduction (Patar, 2021),
and disruption to the caribou population (Venn, 2021a) the Baffinland
Corporation is simultaneously waging a campaign to encourage public
support for a major expansion (Venn, 2021b). [Without extensive
planning, **Inuit communities** may be **tasked with living with and
caring for toxic legacies** at emerging mine sites]{.underline} the same
way Yellowknives Dene First Nation must live with the waste entombed at
the Giant Mine. This thesis follows Myra Hird's theorizing of [**waste**
as a set of materials interacting with human and inhuman actors and
environments with a set of **relationalities** that reflect and
**reinforce** inequalities and structural forces of **oppression**
including ongoing (settler) colonialism, rather than materials that can
be adequately managed with more and better technological
solutions]{.underline} (Hird, 2021). [**Waste** rock]{.underline} from
the Baffinland Mary River mine [is not merely inert material to be
stockpiled in landfills but an **indeterminate material that will flow
through the biosphere in unpredictable ways**]{.underline} -- **[out of
sight of southern settler populations but intra-acting with Inuit
communities and lands in perpetuity.]{.underline}**

### L---Nuclear Technology

#### The 1AC stationing of nuclear technology reinforce a logics of "geography of sacrifice", where marginalized communities become testing sites, inhabiting a toxic territory that remains corralled and delineated from society.

[The development of nuclear technologies for power generation, weapons
manufacturing, food conservation, and medical procedures have multiplied
the places intertwined by this industry. In geographical research, this
spatial deployment is described as a planetary unifying force having
"irrevocably merged radiation with land and bodies" due to its "capacity
to connect dispar- ate geographies through its vibrant and invisible
materiality]{.underline}" (Alexis-Martin and Davies 2017). Yet, the
atomic complex produced an archipelago of places which are unevenly
nuclear. [Mobilizing the concepts of "geography of sacrifice" (Lerner
2012; Cram 2016a) and "nuclear colonialism" (Endres 2009; Nelta 2011;
Jacobs 2013), research documented how unequally the burden of its en-
vironmental and social consequences was spatially shared.]{.underline}
From an ontological perspective, Gabrielle Hecht's already mentioned
[work (2012) on ura- nium mining in Africa showed that the very act of
categorizing and consider- ing places as nuclear was a technopolitical
process fluctuating through time and space, changing among actors, and
decoupled from the actual nature of the activity. While names like
Hiroshima, Chernobyl, or Fukushima became "geosymbols" (Bonnemaison
1981) of the atomic complex, other spaces should gain this nuclear
association as well because "nuclear technology also inhabits more
mundane spaces"]{.underline} (Alexis-Martin and Davies 2017), such as
hospitals using nuclear medicine daily and food-packing facilities
ionizing fruit and vegetables. The various components of this atomic
archipelago are not evenly considered as nuclear, and neither do places
which once hosted atomic activities lose their nuclearity after
decommissioning.

While scholars took interest in the spatial dynamics of the atomic
complex early in the 1950s, nuclear geography experienced a renewal in
the 2010s following the multiplication of radioactive waste disposal
projects and the 2011 Fukushima accident (Alexis-Martin and Davies
2017). Once lacking integra- tion and coherence, this constellation of
research led to growing theorization efforts (Alexis-Martin et al.
2021). Yet, a by-product of this renewal is the inflation [of
geographical concepts applied to signify places of the atomic com- plex:
"atomic lands" (Osseo-Asare 2016), "nuclear oasis" (Kari 2010), "nuclear
community" (Hänninen and Yli-Kauhaluoma 2014), "nuclear territory"
(Storm 2020), "nuclear landscapes" (Pitkanen and Farish 2018), "nuclear
spaces" (Stanley 2013), and "nuclear zones" (Alexis-Martin and Davies
2017). These concepts do not constitute a coherent corpus. Articles do
not always formulate definitions for the terms they employ and often
switch from one to another without indicating any clear differences
between them]{.underline}. Further- more, while these notions have their
own epistemology in geography litera- ture, papers rarely reflect their
ontologies.\
Nuclear spaces are distinguished by the presence of things related to
the atomic complex. Some articles describe them as places enduring demo-
graphic and socioeconomic transformation caused by industry (Karafantis
2014). Others tend to focus on the presence of radiation and
radionuclides. Being invisible and intangible, the active process of
designating radiation is what allows "nuclear places to come into being"
(Alexis-Martin and Davies 2017). [Nuclear spaces -- eventually coined as
"irradiated spaces" (Alexis-Mar- tin and Davies 2017) -- are
distinguished here both by the existence of radia- tion and by the human
actions of measuring, controlling, and delineating, sometimes by means
of maps or warning signs (Luedee 2021).]{.underline} Finally, [nuclear
spaces are places of exception "where different rules, modes of behav-
iour and exclusions apply" (Davies 2015), delimited by negotiated
boundaries.]{.underline}

Consistent with a Sackian epistemology (Murphy 2012), nuclear
territories are defined by the borders that delimit them. For Storm
(2020), nuclear territories are "social and industrial enclaves" whose
borders are required by "the level of secrecy and levels of calculated
risk." Their very existence is linked to the presence of nuclear
activity. [Osseo-Asare (2016) is the only scholar mobilizing the concept
of atomic land, which he occasionally switches for "nuclear territory"
and "toxic territory."]{.underline} [Borders define atomic lands,
assembled through administrative categorization and judicial work to
enclose spaces dedicated to nuclear operations.]{.underline} Recurrently
employed in papers on Chernobyl or Fukushima, [nuclear zones refer to
well-delimited areas purposely produced to protect society from risks,
be it from radiation (Alexis-Martin and Davies 2017; Lerner 2012b; Overy
2020) or atomic weapons in the case of nuclear-free zones (Clements
2015). Again, zones are defined by what they enclose and by the peculiar
norms, rules, and laws which are applied.]{.underline}\
Nuclear landscapes gained the greatest momentum in the literature,
emboldened both by the renewal of landscape research (Benediktsson 2007)
and by its association with other concepts such as "[landscapes of
justice" (Pitkanen and Farish 2018), "landscapes of threat" (Davies and
Polese 2015), "anti-ther- apeutic landscapes"]{.underline} (Davies
2015), "[post-industrial landscapes" (Dawney 2019), "subterranean
landscapes" (Saraç-Lesavre 2019), and "irradiated landscapes" (Masco
2004).]{.underline} The nuclear landscape approach differs from the
previous border-centred one.4 The term "landscape" is used to signify
the fluidity of radiation, indicating "that these spaces are ultimately
impossible to enclose" (Pitkanen and Farish 2018), blurring the
"boundary between con- taminated and safe" (Davies and Polese 2015).
Intangible and uncontainable (Masco 2004), "[radiation could be
anywhere, yet appears nowhere: it resides in everyday spaces and on
ordinary objects" (Pitkanen 2017), thus turning nu- clear landscapes
into places of uncertainty (Pitkanen 2020]{.underline}). This concept is
nurtured by the [dualism between visibility and invisibility at the core
of re- search on landscapes (Figueroa 2018). This invisibility goes
beyond the im- perceptibility of radiation. Nuclear landscapes are
outlined both by the "phys- ical scars" (Wills 2001) and by the everyday
actions (Pitkanen 2017), political acts (Pitkanen 2020; Wills 2001), and
ideologies (Dawney 2019; Edwards 2011; Runyan 2018; Saraç-Lesavre 2019;
Stanley 2008) sustaining them.]{.underline}\
Nuclear communities have been mobilized in research investigating the
acceptance of radioactive waste projects. While mainly an actor-centred
and relational concept, it bears two competing significations. On the
one side, [nuclear communities are municipalities hosting nuclear
facilities (Haraldsen 2014; Litmanen, Kojo, and Kari 2010) coalesced by
a "nuclear identity" (Kojo, Kari, and Litmanen 2012). Sometimes coined
as "nuclear neighbourhood" or "host communities" (Kojo, Kari, and
Litmanen 2012; Litmanen, Kojo, and Kari 2010), they are characterized by
their dependency shared with the indus- try, which sustains unbalanced
power relations]{.underline}. Congruent with this approach, (Blowers,
Lowry, and Solomon 1991; Blowers 1999) introduced the notion of [nuclear
oasis to distinguish remote, economically marginal, and powerless
communities, which are more prone to accept nuclear activities. On the
other hand, nuclear community refers to the results of strategic tools
used by the nuclear sector to build acceptant collectives around its
facilities]{.underline}. Nuclear communities are seen "not only as
residents but also as a socially constructed imagery of togetherness
associated with nuclear works, local cul- ture, and the past" (Hänninen
and Yli-Kauhaluoma 2014).

### L---Oil

#### Oil extraction enacts necropolitics in the Arctic---Khanty people and lands are sacrificed as oil infrastructure transforms the living into zones of destruction. Settler colonial expansion treats both Indigenous bodies and Arctic ecosystems as disposable, using pipelines and alcohol to extend the "flow of death" across human and non-human life. Extraction renders the Khanty people as disposable- oil driven necropolitics turns their living culture into a symbol of extinction.

Pg. 175-179

The contrast between [the oil seeker's map and the liquid map of the
river creates a juxtaposition between the oil and the river, the two
liquids flowing on and under the ground. These concrete and material
fluids are entangled in manifold webs of discourses, desires and
imaginaries]{.underline}. The inseparability of what is imagined and
what is material in Aipin's descriptions of flowing water and oil bring
forth Gaston Bachelard's (1983) argument on using the interconnectedness
of imaginary176 E. Kuikka concepts and material entities to express
abstract ideas. In the novel, the river appears as an element that is
ultimately connected with life as its physical flow is parallelised with
the flows of life, time and memories and, at the same time, it sus-
tains the organic life of the Khanty people by providing them with the
necessary living conditions. Mika Perkiömäki (2021) has noticed a
similar tendency to imag- ine and present the major Siberian rivers in
Russian village prose texts as "rivers of life". The metaphor
"underline\[s\] the common history, interdependency and fate of the
river and the people' and 'connects to the active, agentic river, whose
actions have implications for both human culture and the more-than-human
world" (Perkiömäki, 2021, p. 110). He has also noticed a prevailing
metaphor of the "river of death" that presents the river as "dangerous
and lethal" or as related to environmental damage and contamination (p.
107). In contrast to Perkiömäki's observations, the river and the water
in Aipin's novel do not bear any lethal connotations as the deadly
characteristics are attached to the oil. [The oil, depicted as "the
black, hot grease" (Aipin, 2014, p. 24) that flows in the black pipes,
becomes a literal stream of death as oil pumping destroys the
environment for both human and non-human entities. The notion of death
is drawn on the geologists' maps as well as the lines marking out
possible oil deposits signify destruction for everything that gets in
the way of those lines. If the river serves as a live, flowing and
constantly transforming map of the watery milieu that connects the lives
of the Khanty people with the non-human entities with which they share
and co-constitute the space they inhabit, the streams of the oil draw a
map that enforces settler-colonial power and an instrumentalised view of
the non-human world. Whereas the river adapts to the relief of the
environment and sustains the ecosystems and living entities to which it
is connected, the oil reserves lead to constructions of straight
railway- and pipelines whose build- ers "cut down pine woods, covered
swamps, built bridges over big and small rivers" (Aipin, 2014, p.
24).]{.underline}

The fear that the oil seekers provoke in Dem'ian is based on what he has
heard from the regions where oil is already pumped. The novel's
temporally non-linear narrative structure reveals to the reader that his
concern is not in vain by revealing the destructive development of the
region to the reader through the narrative line that follows Dem'ian's
son Mikul'. Even if Aipin's novel entails depictions of brute acts of
violence, especially in the flashbacks depicting the purges of the
1930s, the main narrative strategy of presenting colonial violence in
the novel is to underline the long-term impacts of the settlers and the
environmental colonialism experienced by the Khanty people. In the next
section of this chapter, I argue that the depiction of the
settler-colonial violence in the novel can be read through Rob Nixon's
(2011) concept of slow violence. In my view, Aipin's novel offers a
demonstrative example of how slow violence can constitute different
interrelated and cumulative processes that have a destructive effect on
both subaltern groups of people and the non-human world.10

As presented earlier in this chapter, [Nixon's slow violence is a
concept that is used to describe gradual violence, the effects of which
are only visible in the long term or/and in the distance, effects that
may not be even recognised as violence.]{.underline} This graduality and
temporal dispersal is visible in Aipin's novel, and whereas Nixon (2011,
p. 3) pointed out what challenges presenting slow violence might face,
Aipin's work resolves this problem through its narrative structure. When
the narra- tion of the novel leaps back and forth between the past,
present and the future, vio- lent causal connections whose consequences
are not revealed during one's lifetime or during a generation are made
visible. In particular, the narrator's tendency to move into the future
and narrate Mikul's experiences in adulthood sheds light on the
disastrous results of the Soviet policies and resource extraction.

Despite the novel's anachronism, the reader can distinguish the
development of the region since the establishment of the Soviet power
and the arrival of oil seekers. In the beginning of Dem'ian's journey,
he recalls a time "when he did not think of anything other than hunting
and fishing" and "a peace lived in his soul[". That peace is ended when
"new people appeared on the Vat'ëgan river to build a metal road"
(Aipin, 2014, p. 23), and at the time of Dem'ian's journey, "\[t\]he
bottomlands in the East were split in two by a pipe; there was oil in
the South and a railway line in the West" (p. 42).]{.underline} The
consequences of Soviet policies for the Khanty's home region are already
present by the time Dem'ian makes his journey: the hunters' hunting
areas of the "lowest river" have been destroyed, alcohol consumption is
slowly increasing, and Khanty families suffer from a lack of reindeer,
the most important companion of Indigenous hunters moving across the
taiga. However, only the narrator's leaps to the1980s with Dem'ian's
grown-up son Mikul' reveals the tragic development of the situation.

[Mikul's experiences and observations in his home region underline the
interconnectedness of the resource extraction, environmental degradation
and wilting of the Indigenous community:]{.underline}

[Under the pressure of geologists and oil men the village slowly fell in
onto economic depression. First, the cooperative lost its reindeer herd
of 300 reindeer, then its cows and horses. Growing vegetables ended due
to a lack of fertilizers. Game and fish disappeared due to contamination
of lakes and rivers]{.underline} and unreasonable logging. That forced
people to close down the fox farm. (Aipin, 2014, p. 265)

[The environmental degradation and animal loss that bring an end to the
traditional livelihoods is followed by alienation of Native children
from their parents' culture as boarding schools move further away from
the taiga and into urban centres. All these factors are depicted as
interrelated and leading to the gradual decline of the Native people.
Therefore, Aipin's description of the consequences of settler
colonialism is in line with Wakeham's (2021) notes on slow, attritional
violence leading to the annihilation of Indigenous societies, social
practices and cultures with a geno- cidal effect (cf. Wolfe,
2006).]{.underline}

The correlation between [environmental damage and social decline is
illustrated through the interconnectedness of the settler-colonial flows
of death, oil and spirits.]{.underline} In the same way that the people
who map the region and extract its oil come to the taiga from outside,
spirits are also brought there from elsewhere. Yet, it is the river
along which alcohol is transported: "The river did its job: it fed and
watered. But it did not only give clear water to drink. A regular
transportation of boxes with alcohol bottles to [the]{.underline}
village began ten years later" (Aipin, 2014, p. 125). The same river
that connects the Khanty families with each other and connects the
Khanty people with the region also connects the area with other parts of
the country, and [the river flow carries the alcohol that then flows
down the Khanty people's throats. However, the "era of the bottle"
(Aipin, 2014, pp. 125--126) only starts after the arrival of the oil
seekers and the village they establish]{.underline}, where "the shops
are open without a break and during the weekends" (p. 125). The
intersections of these different flows bring out the embodied character
of the relationship between the Khanty people and their home region. As
these liquids flow between different regions, as well as between human
bodies and the non-human environment, they point to the porosity of
their interfaces in a trans-corporeal way and show how inseparable human
bodies are from their material surrounding. [When the oil extraction and
consequent environmental damage are approached through the oil's
interconnectedness with spirits and how it spills over the region with
the geologists, environmental problems and the alcoholism among the
Khanty people cannot be seen as separate phenomena. Instead, they appear
as a continuation of the same "flow of death". Whereas the geologists
following the flowing oil "dig up the forests and the endless swamps"
(Aipin, 2014, p. 42), the spirits flowing with the geologists "takes"
one Khanty person after another. The rampant alcoholism in the region is
not only a social con- sequence of the natural resource extraction but
also a continuum of the settler-colonial slow violence in different
human and non-human bodies.]{.underline}

After all, in the novel the alcohol-related deaths of the Khanty people
seem almost less tragic than the break of the communicative and cultural
memories, which not only destroys individuals but also the Indigenous
people as a nation. The Russian literary scholar Ol'ga Lagunova (2007,
p. 123) pointed out the importance of memory for the survival of the
people by comparing Dem'ian's recount of the bear feast to an event
taking place in the future, after Dem'ian's journey. In this event,
Dem'ian's son, Mikul', contacts his old relative Galaktion Kurpelak in
order to hear old songs and stories, but the old man, who has lost all
his relatives to alco- hol, states: "My mind is empty, my words have run
off. What stories there were ... In this century of sufferings" (Aipin,
2014, p. 260). In the contrast between these scenes, Lagunova (2007, p.
123) sees the end of an era in the history of the Khanty people, a
change from the time when stories, myths and rituals are carried in peo-
ple's mind to one when they have disappeared from memory:

The space of the feast, in which everyone knew when and what they were
supposed to do and say, and the space of the seemingly boundless fairy
tale that joins together everything alive, entails all times and unites
generations, have fallen apart: the elderly people have left and the
young ones do not remember. \[...\] And so comes the end, the end for
all: for songs, fairy tales, feasts, family, home, Land \[sic\], life.
(Lagunova, 2007, p. 123)10

As Lagunova points out, when Galaktion Kurpelak lets go of the tales and
stories he used to tell, the cultural memory of the Khanty people is not
transmitted from one generation to another. Whereas Mikul's father has
participated in the bear feast him- self and is therefore able to recall
its course and related songs, for Mikul' the oral tradition of the
Khanty remains a vague recollection from childhood. The following
generation will have no personal experience of the national feasts or
folklore. The break in the communicative chain of memory between
different Khanty generations stifles the live and natural flow of the
cultural memory and solidifies it into Nora's lieux de mémoire, forming
lifeless symbols that merely represent the Indigenous community rather
than reconnect to it. This is already the case with one distant rela-
tive of Mikul' who "collects exhibits of Khanty's applied arts for an
exhibition of the Achievements of National Economy" in Moscow (Aipin,
2014, p. 262). [Gradually, the vivid Indigenous culture turns into a
curiosity and a symbolic demonstration of the multi-ethnicity of the
Soviet Union until it becomes a remnant of an extinct
community.]{.underline} As a result of alcohol abuse, the break of the
communicative and cultural memories cannot be separated from oil
drilling and its environmental consequences, and hence, the thoroughness
of the following devastation of the Khanty people is comparable to the
destruction of the taiga caused by the natural resource extraction.

### L---Permafrost

#### The 1AC's investment into the formation of permafrost science functions as a technology of control by settler colonial states to further extraction within the Arctic at the expense of indigenous communities. 

**Murray 23** (Stephanie Murray, candidate for a post-professional
Master of Architecture Studies at the Carleton University; 2023;
"Engaging Frozen Grounds: practices of spatial imagination and colonial
violence at the Canadian Arctic coast") -- Langham EY

[Permafrost is co-produced with humans.]{.underline} Drawing from her
research of works that involve placemaking and climate, Cho references
anthropologist Phillip Vannini, stating that ["'it can be argued that
**permafrost 'is produced as much as it is experienced**, and **the
process of how \[it\] is produced is inseparable from how it is
experienced.**'"]{.underline}86

[**From a settler perspective, the intentionalities of activity within
the Arctic have been expressly for infrastructural and urban
developments that support projects of extraction and sovereignty, both
highly militarized** and engineered. **The positioning of permafrost
within these creates a series of expectations and interventions to
preserve this solidity.** Counterintuitively these projects contribute
to the increasing fluctuations of permafrost, whether through thermal
bridges within construction designs, disruption of protective topsoil
layers or contributions to climate change.]{.underline}

> [The materiality of **arctic ground** has been understood to resist a
> wide spectrum of territorial interventions, **requiring
> technoscientific 'correction' that** further **sharpened distinctions
> between western and indigenous forms of environmental
> knowledge.**]{.underline}87

Cho clearly states that [the "engineering treatment of permafrost" and
the "**formation of permafrost science**" **has been a vehicle of
territorialization.**]{.underline} Further, she states that "with an
increasing interest to merge arctic sciences with interdisciplinary
research and action-oriented outcomes that can directly benefit local
communities, it is of a timely importance to position permafrost as a
relational subject of many meanings"88 because the positioning of
permafrost will inevitably influence spatial methods. Underlying this
logic is the notion that Ice is the problem and the exception, as
opposed to an expectation.

### L---Pollution

#### Pollution is the Arctic is caused by a multitude of Western development projects, rooted in the figuration of the Arctic as an empty site open to colonial expansion -- The 1AC continues this history of waste colonialism, exposing indigenous peoples to slow death from exacerbated exposure to toxins.

**Vladimirova 23** (Vladislava Vladimirova, Associate Professor of the
Department of Cultural Anthropology and Ethnology at Uppsala University;
4-23; "Indigenous People Living with Waste and Pollution in the Arctic",
Ecological Concerns in Transition: A Comparative Study on Responses to
Waste and Environmental Destruction in the Region, pg. 45-48) -- Langham
EY

Different [conceptualizations of the **Arctic**]{.underline} (Arcticism,
following Said's Orientalism) have coexisted historically and perpetuate
themselves today, and [predetermine popular perceptions]{.underline} and
expectations. [Some of the most stable **representations** are those of
icy hell and wilderness, a **frontier devoid of human
civilization**]{.underline}; or on the contrary, of a paradise rich in
species and Indigenous cultures.1 Such [ideas have]{.underline} also
[**influenced** the **exploitation**]{.underline} or protection [of
Arctic areas.]{.underline} Based on the former perception, [modernity
triggered a parallel idea of the Arctic as a territory of rich
resources, to be tamed and mastered through scientific exploration,
human technological genius, toil, and heroism.]{.underline}2 Throughout
the 20th century, [**Arctic areas** have been actively explored by
scientists and governmental agents and "mastered"]{.underline} --
[**used for extraction of renewable resources and minerals,
transportation, competition and claims of sovereignty and geopolitical
domination.** Exploitation of the Arctic frontiers has a long history
that is associated with the establishment and administration of states
and their colonization of land and people in consolidating power both
nationally and internationally.]{.underline} The earliest forms of
exploitation were centered on valuable animal species,3 while later,
with the advance of scientific knowledge, technology, and
transportation, exploitation left more a visible footprint.4
**[Geological exploration, mining and drilling, processing ores and
chemical substances, military industry and weapon testing, nuclear
power, and urbanization, have transformed Arctic landscapes beyond
repair.]{.underline}**

In contrast to the expectations of scientists, ecologists, and
ideologues of scientific and economic progress of early 20th century,
[humanity has not managed to advance nature exploitation to a level
where pollution and waste are insignifcant.]{.underline}5 When traveling
in the Arctic, one is stunned by the contrast between breathtaking
natural vistas, landscapes, wild fora and fauna, and picturesque
villages and farms, and severely disturbed forest and tundra land, pits
and landfills, polluted water, litter, and areas fenced of for
unauthorized visitors. Arctic pollution is a major concern both for
scientists and environmental activists who advocate nature preservation,
and for critical social theorists who analyze it in relation to
colonialism and contemporary neoliberal governance. [**Accumulated
waste** and pollution **in the Arctic** are not only a legacy or
heritage of colonialism, but **continue to produce exclusion,
inequality, and inferior Indigenous subjects.**]{.underline} On the one
hand, [**governments** and companies **create** and deposit waste and
**pollution from the reproduction of capitalism into areas they consider
peripheral, subjecting their population** to cohabitation with waste and
its negative impacts.]{.underline} On the other hand, [the majority
population blames peripheral and Indigenous communities for being
"backward" for not conforming to or welcoming **green technology**, like
for example wind energy, even when the price is **sacrificing** their
**traditional economy and culture**, like reindeer herding.]{.underline}

Just as there are contrasting conceptual representations of the Arctic,
scientists are inconsistent when assessing the level of pollution in the
Arctic zone. While UNEP (United Nations Environmental Program), states
that the Arctic is a relatively clean environment in comparison with
other parts of the world,6 many scientists and activists are raising the
alarm, claiming that [the Arctic presents some of the most polluted
areas in the world.]{.underline}7 [**Climate change**, instead of
serving as a warning to delimit industrialization, **is seen by many as
a chance to access**, extract, and export **more resources in the
Arctic** due to melting permafrost and sea ice.]{.underline} Climatic,
natural, geological, social, political, and historical factors lead to
specific forms, length of life and unpredictable impacts of pollution
and waste in the Arctic. The Arctic contains 5% of the world's oil, and
most oil production takes place in Northern Russia and Alaska.
[**Petroleum** products are not only extracted, but also used, stored,
and transported in Arctic areas, and **fuel spills**]{.underline} that
occur in the Russian part of the Arctic and in cold regions [are
recognized as the most **extensive and damaging** **pollution** to
ecosystems and human health.]{.underline}8 [Due to the cold climate,
natural attenuation is slow and petroleum concentration remains high for
long time.]{.underline} Seasonal thaws then cause continuous dispersion
every summer, and bulk extraction is not possible due to the high cost.9
On the other hand, [the climate also contributes to infrastructure
wearing out more quickly, and thus frequent oil spills]{.underline},
especially in Russia. Shoreline spills from tankers or resupply vessels
are the second largest source of oil pollution.10

[The Arctic is also a stage for intensive military activity, production,
storage and weapons testing]{.underline} thanks to its strategic
location to Europe, America, and Asia, and its conceptualization as a
frontier and a wilderness. [Huge **military infrastructures** are hidden
in the Arctic from "enemies' eyes"; training over large territories and
challenging terrains, testing of technologies of mass destruction and
extermination are also taking place.]{.underline}11 Due to its severe
climate, the high cost of infrastructure and transport maintenance, and
the perception of Indigenous people as under-developed, [governments
imagine that it is easier to conceal in the Arctic the **huge
destruction** that the natural environment and **local communities** are
**subjected to due to** armament and **militarization** of the world.
The location of a high number of **nuclear sources** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, including the nuclear ice-breaker feet of Russia,
together with [global fallout from atmospheric **nuclear tests, liquid
discharges from nuclear plants, and accidents, cause radioactive
contamination.**]{.underline} 12 [The **waste** and pollution **caused
by militarization** often **intersect with** industrial pollution,
**displacement** of Indigenous communities, inequality, and]{.underline}
nowadays [climate change.]{.underline}

In addition to locally produced pollution, [highly **concentrated
chemicals**, heavy metals, and other hazardous substances travel to and
are deposited in the Arctic as a **result of** extensive long-range
**transport through air and ocean currents.**]{.underline}13 Arctic haze
in the winter is one phenomenon that has been discussed by scientists
since at least the 1970s. [It consists of a mixture of gases and
particles]{.underline} ([aerosols]{.underline}), some of which are of
chemical composition, such as sulfate, graphic carbon, lead, cadmium,
sulfur and other compounds [from pesticides and
fungicides.]{.underline}14 [**Sulfur threatens low level ozone**,
disrupts atmospheric energy flows, and **contributes to acid rain.**
Copper, lead, zinc and arsenic accumulate in lichens and
mosses.]{.underline}15 [Their accumulation in Arctic ecosystems, trophic
chains, and from there in human and animal bodies are among the highest
measured anywhere in the world. Those **pollutants cause health risks
that** particularly **affect Indigenous populations**]{.underline}, who
are most dependent on locally grown food supplies, both wild and
domestic.16

In the 1980s scholars started observing that PCBs (Polychlorinated
biphenyls, toxic compounds produced and used since the 1930s),
travelling through long range atmospheric transport, are being
accumulated in Arctic regions. PCBs dissolve in fats and oils and adsorb
to sediment particles and have thus bioaccumulated in food webs and are
consumed by humans, who are in addition exposed to them through drinking
water and inhalation of contaminated air. Scientists relate PCBs to a
number of skin, blood, immune and reproductive diseases, even though
when exposure is low causal relations are hard to prove.17

The Arctic climate and physical characteristics also predetermine the
seasonality of pollutants' dispersal and interaction with ecosystems: in
the summer months compounds defrost and disperse, causing serious risks
to ecosystems, animals and human population. The shortage of available
water and limited soil development also influence the way contaminants
behave. Many polar species are slow growing and long living, which
permits the accumulation of larger amounts of contaminants than in other
parts of the world.18

Plastic pollution is also pervasive in the Arctic, even in areas with no
human activities. Only a small share of it is from local sources, like
fisheries, landfills, wastewater, and offshore industrial activity. The
dominant part of plastic pollution such as plastic debris and
microplastics are carried from lower latitudes by ocean currents, the
atmosphere and rivers. As climate change intensifies, plastic emissions
produce an increased microplastic burden on Arctic ecosystems and
humans.19

International Cooperation

National states address Arctic pollution in domestic legislation, while
international mechanisms vary in their goals and impact. The AEPS
(Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy), established in 1991, strives
to protect Arctic ecosystems and humans (specifically mentioning
Indigenous people and cultures) through sustainable utilization of
natural resources, regular monitoring of the environment and identifying
and reducing pollution. Under this initiative, AMAP (Arctic Monitoring
and Assessment Program) was launched to implement pollution control and
assessment of its impact on ecosystem and human health. Since 1998, the
Arctic Council (AC) has been actively involved with ACAP (Arctic Council
Action Plan to eliminate pollution of the Arctic). IASC, the
International Arctic Science Committee, aims at helping coordinate
research related to the Arctic, and nowadays often strives to include
Indigenous peoples' representatives at its work and events.

At the nongovernmental level, environmental activists in the past have
often acted in disregard of the interests of Indigenous people living in
the Arctic.20 Therefore, alliances between environmental organizations
and Indigenous organizations and communities are a recent phenomenon, as
is Indigenous organizations' environmental agenda. Indigenous groups
started lobbying against hazardous substances within their states in the
1980s and pushing towards more scientific research on their impact on
human health. Indigenous groups have been involved in AMAP and have
actively looked for their recognition through influencing the work of
the AC and IASC.21

The Materiality of Waste in the Arctic -- the Home of Indigenous People

Only in the last decade has scholarship on waste and pollution paid
serious attention to materiality: "as much as societies have sought to
\[...\] hide their wastes for fear of contamination, so academia has
been shy of the stuff of waste," engaging instead with topics such as
waste management, disposal, technology, and politics.22 Gregson and
Crang critically explore [the politics of this avoidance]{.underline} to
remind us that 1) the category of [waste]{.underline} has situational
and relational character and [is]{.underline} not only [expressive of
social values]{.underline}, but also sustains them; throughout history,
[**waste** and dirt have been **used to create** and maintain **social
borders**]{.underline}; categories and social orders use materials but
are not determined by them; 2) observing that studies on the USA in the
20th century show [a predominant **location of waste sites** and
industrial discharge i**n proximity to** areas with high numbers of
**people of color**]{.underline}, they locate debates about waste within
the framework of environmental justice, where they point to its
hazardous nature and persistence of its material properties; 3)
[pointing to waste's materiality shows that it is part of a
sociotechnical complex]{.underline}, not an asocial matter or a social
convention. [Waste is a process]{.underline} that is both material and
social, politically influenced and part [of the governance and creation
of society and maintenance of particular power relations and
inequality.]{.underline}23 The literature on post-war environments has
taken a lead in theorizing the materiality of war-related pollution,
such as organic materials, chemical pollution and landmines.24 Eleana
Kim, for example, writing about unexploded mines in battlefield
landscapes, shows how [military waste persists and alters ecosystems,
including human individuals and communities.]{.underline}25

#### The 1AC's willful exposure of pollution to indigenous communities is a form Necropolitics that exposes racialized populations to slow death through a temporalized accumulation of environmental injury.

**Davies 18** (Thom Davies, Associate Professor of School of Geography
at the University of Nottingham; 2018; "Toxic Space and Time: Slow
Violence, Necropolitics, and Petrochemical Pollution", Annals of the
American Association of Geographers, 108:6, 1537-1553; DOI:
10.1080/24694452.2018.1470924) -- Langham EY

Yet unlike biopolitics or other commonly cited theorizations of
administered brutality, [**slow violence** does not originate from a
single exclusionary sovereign power but **emerges from "a labyrinth of
forces at work"**]{.underline} (Mbembe 2001, 174). [In an era of "high
globalization"]{.underline} (Hulme 2016), [the sources of
**environmental harm** are often dispersed and **entangled in a complex
assemblage of corporate power, state authority, local regulations, and
capitalist structures of accumulation**]{.underline} (Harvey 2006; Appel
et al. 2015; O'Lear 2016). [In such conditions of neoliberalism, "there
is no corporate or individual sovereign acting deliberately to implant
qualities in a collection of bodies"]{.underline} (Berlant 2007, 765).
The frequent absence of a cohesive sovereign authority in cases of
dispersed environmental risk makes applying such theorizations to
pollution more difficult. Although the "deferred causalities" (Nixon
2011, 61) of slow violence could, for example, be framed as
postpollution homo sacer (Agamben 1998; see Davies 2013, 2015; Davies
and Polese 2015), without a sovereign authority administering the
violence, this biopolitical rendering falls flat.

Indeed, Berlant (2007) argued that the health of entire populations can
be gradually eroded through the machinations of neoliberalism itself
(see Butler 2009; Springer 2015; Tyner 2016). Like slow violence, her
concept of "slow death" is not isolated in time-framed acts of obvious
brutality but instead is hidden in long-term forms of harm, "whose
contours in time and space are often identified with the presentness of
ordinariness itself" (Berlant 2007, 759). [In terms of environmental
injustice, such as **slow exposures to toxic substances**, this prosaic
**"wearing out"**]{.underline} (754) [of **populations over time** is
not biopolitically deliberate, yet it nevertheless **produces unequal**
and often **racialized experiences of slow pollution**]{.underline}
(Cantor 2017).

In essence, with cases of environmental injustice or slow violence, life
is not being "made to die" in a Foucauldian (1978, italics added) sense,
nor are individuals completely stripped of all political worth, in terms
of becoming "bare life" (Agamben 1998). In fact, environmental justice
campaigns rely heavily on appeals to the law and political rights to
achieve justice (see Allen 2003). Instead, an alternative reading of
slow violence is needed to help theorize the embodied experience of
gradual environmental harm.

I suggest that Mbembe's (2003) work on "necropolitics" provides useful
inroads into understanding contemporary experiences of pollution
described in the empirical section of this article. Mbembe introduced
necropower to encompass the "subjugation of life to the power of death"
(39). This is more than the Foucauldian idea of the right to kill but
rather the right to expose people to the possibility of death; in other
words, not to make someone die but to let them (Li 2010; Tyner 2016).
This subtle distinction between "make die" and "let die" violence goes
some way to explain the experience of slow violence at the hands of an
unlocatable, dispersed, and contested polluter. No one is being actively
killed through pollution as a means of biopolitical control. Rather,
[**communities** who have been **"designated expendable"**]{.underline}
(Nixon 2011, 151) [**are allowed to suffer the attritional violence of
environmental pollution**, often **through** the "**violent inaction**"
of regulating authorities]{.underline} (Davies et al. 2017, 1281).

Using the example of the slave plantation, Mbembe theorized forms of
violence that do not involve the outright killing of individuals but
their slow biological degradation or wounding. He described how
[colonized bodies were "kept alive but in a state of
injury"]{.underline} (Mbembe 2003, 21), [which dovetails with the **slow
experience of pollution**, often **experienced** in socially uneven ways
and meted out following the **shifting contours of race, class, and
gender**]{.underline} (Bullard et al. 2008; Zimring 2016). [This
permanent wounding of populations, without immediate or deliberate
death, echoes the way in which slow violence interacts with marginalized
and polluted bodies: the "casualties of accumulative environmental
injury"]{.underline} (Nixon 2011, 144). Just as Mbembe's colonialized
bodies were kept in a state of gradual injury through processes of
imperial domination, Nixon's interpretation of slow violence shows how
[the **uneven spread of** globalization and **pollution** similarly
**keeps marginalized groups in** situations and **spaces** **of wounded
subjugation.**]{.underline}

Mbembe (2003) described the slow tenacity of necropolitical injury; how
it can "persist for a long time, in the form of human shapes that are
alive, to be sure, but whose bodily integrity has been replaced by
pieces, fragments, folds, even immense wounds that are difficult to
close" (35). **[The violence of environmental pollution]{.underline}**,
too, as Nixon and other scholars note (see Adams 1998), [**has** this
**drawn-out temporal reach**, which can penetrate the biological fabric
of the blood, tissue, and bones. **Environmental wounding such as
chemical or nuclear exposure can be**]{.underline} "[**driven inward**,
somatized into cellular dramas of mutation that---particularly **in the
bodies** of the poor---remain largely unobserved, undiagnosed, and
untreated]{.underline}" (Nixon 2011, 6).

[Slow violence]{.underline}, then, can be read [as a form of late-modern
necropolitics, where communities are exposed to the power of
death-in-life. It is a nondeliberate consequence of **polluting
industries that they expose subaltern populations**]{.underline}
(especially) **[to the experience of "death-worlds"]{.underline}**
(Mbembe 2003, 40). [This is not the highly visible or spectacular
killing of genocide or execution but rather a slower, stealthier, and
less obvious form of brutality.]{.underline} Those most affected by the
invisible and gradual harm of environmental pollution are "subjected to
conditions of life conferring upon them the status of living dead"
(Mbembe 2003, 40). [Although slow violence entails a postponement of
harm, it is often also predicated by an entrenchment of **long-standing
social inequalities, rendering some groups more vulnerable to pollution
than others.**]{.underline} As geographers and environmental justice
scholars have repeatedly demonstrated (Pulido 2000; Bullard et al. 2008;
Walker 2012; Brahinsky et al. 2014), **[the distribution of pollution
has a highly racialized dimension]{.underline}**, which fits with
Mbembe's postcolonial framing.1 Putting race at the center of these
geographies, polluting industries are often found in places that are
"demographically legible as neighborhoods of color" (Brahinsky et al.
2014, 8).

Mbembe described how [racialized bodies are exposed to miserable living
conditions through a "state of siege"]{.underline} (Mbembe 2003, 22),
which can be read in this article in the polluted postcolonial landscape
of Cancer Alley. For some of the predominantly black communities located
alongside petrochemical infrastructure, the everyday conditions produced
through exposure to slow violence promote spatialized feelings of
constriction and claustrophobia but also a temporal dimension of
helplessness and slow observation. As McKittrick (2013) wrote on the
persistent geographies of the plantation, [contemporary racism "must be
understood alongside complex negotiations of time, space, and
terror"]{.underline} (3). Both Nixon (2011) and Mbembe (2003)
incorporated slower temporalities in their framings of power and
violence, which is of critical use when we explore how local residents
experience, articulate, and understand environmental pollution in their
everyday lives.

### L---Sea Ice

#### Science, mapping, and climate discourses are NOT neutral, they are all colonial tools that enforce settler control- they frame the Arctic as both a technical problem to be solved through governance and a site of inevitable Indigenous disappearance. Damage narratives turn Arctic life into a symbol of global loss.

3 \| THE STORIFICATION OF ICE IN ARCTIC GEOPOLITICS

In our reading of the Arctic, we argue that [contemporary Arctic
geopolitical discourse too often pivots around simple causalities such
as less sea ice equates to growth in maritime traffic and possible
geopolitical tension (]{.underline}for a critical review, Depledge,
2019). This in turn invites a phalanx of technical-scientific experts to
qualify claims about the preponderance of open water or dampen down
expectations that the Arctic will inevitably be a global maritime
highway. [These are particular and familiar colonial moves towards
possessing the Arctic. The relationship between colonialism and northern
territories, including water, is not straightforward given that many of
those lands incorporated into colonial-nation states such as Canada, the
United States and Russia that utilised varying projects, tactics and
techniques to dispossess Indigenous peoples of their lands, lifeways and
liveli- hoods (Kollin, 2001; Ruiz et al., 2019)]{.underline}. [What is
often understood as a settler impulse to eliminate to replace by way of
genocidal warfare is not neatly projected onto landscapes of the Arctic,
especially in thinking of the particularly situated (ongoing) colo- nial
histories in Alaska and Canada.]{.underline} The enactment of allotment,
and terra-forming forest and plain into agriculture including ranching,
though attempted, was not successfully replicated further north. The
early needs for resource extraction as animating the core principle of
settler-racial-capitalism was not easily met by virtue of the presence
of ice and glacier fields of Arctic landscapes. Colonial movements and
travels in search of the Northwest/east Passage of the white nationalist
race to the illusive North Pole were temporary and fleeting---apart from
later public policy directed towards the encouragement and support of
homesteaders and gold miners to populate northern spaces, colonial
actors in the North often did not come to stay. Elemental substances
such as frozen earth, sea ice and glaciers were surveyed, mapped and
manipulated, with colonial agents seeking to thaw out permafrost and
restructure parts of the Arctic landscape in terms of agriculture. The
needs of colonial desires to cultivate particular foods in particular
ways that aligned with property making through labour and land were
thwarted by ice and its liminal shapes of constituting land not water
(Smith, 2021).

[The coupling of scientific expertise and racist legal policies of
dispossession ultimately created similar outcomes of long- standing
oppressive colonial regimes that continue to constitute the present. For
one example, plans such as the so-called Inuit High Arctic relocations
in the early 1950s were hatched in Canada to resettle Indigenous
communities in what is for now understood as northern Quebec, as part of
a strategic calculation designed to populate a 'sparse and spartan'
northern territory. The relocation strategy proved to be a costly and
devastating failure, as it was built upon the notions that all cold
climates are ostensibly the same and therefore Indigenous peoples should
be able to live successfully within them---racist thinking that either
misunderstands or overlooks centuries of relationships built across
Indigenous peoples and more-than-human kin.]{.underline} At the base of
this thinking is a temperate-normative assumption that an adapted cold
weather community in one part of northern Canada could simply be
trans-located for the purpose of filling a less populated area. [The
Inuit High Arctic relocations serve as a poignant reminder of how the
initiatives of relocation are currently iterative---at one moment in the
1950s, Indigenous peoples of the Arctic are made to undergo enforced
relocation by decision of a colonial-nation-state meant to 'uplift' or
to meet the end of an act of colonial sovereignty,]{.underline} but in
the contemporary moment in which Native peoples find their homes
underwater due to carbon consequences, those same nation-states will not
assist in relocation efforts (Audlaluk, 2020).

[The storification of the extent and thickness of sea ice is integral to
Arctic geopolitics---often framed as loss followed by revelation and
enhanced activity and engagement by Arctic and non-Arctic states and
stakeholders (Dodds,]{.underline} 2010[, Dittmer et al.,]{.underline}
2011[).]{.underline} There have been three aspects to all of this that
we believe deserve more explicit and considered attention.
Fundamentally, further attention needs to be given to how these
analogies of sea ice work to produce different framings and
relationships within and beyond the Arctic. First, we might ask what is
the role of sea ice as 'buffer' rather than 'barrier' and/or 'hazard',
and how does such an analogy complicate iterative accounts of sea ice\'s
annual rates of extent or shrinkage (with the inference being that less
sea ice extent and thickness means more likelihood of activity and
possible conflict over the use of polar waters). If sea ice is
considered to be a barrier then that implies that there is either an
obstacle to movement (which someone or thing wishes to cross) and/or
that there is a distinction to be made between one area or another. For
example, the term barrier reef is used to signify an ecological space
betwixt shallow water and shoreline. Whereas sea ice as a material
barrier is often used to help identify the Arctic Ocean as distinct from
the warmer Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. [Sea ice as buffer foregrounds
something quite different; in this rendering, ice is said to perform a
series of ecological services including regulating ocean temperature,
reflecting heat away from ocean and absorbing the energy released by
wave action; whereas sea ice as hazard is framed as such because
commercial and military shipping wishes to traverse ice-covered waters.
Tropes such as 'polar Mediterranean' have long been used to re-configure
the Arctic Ocean and maritime passages as capable, at some point, of
being usable(Steinberg,]{.underline} 2014[).]{.underline}

This shift in the framing of sea ice has developed in two distinct
areas. In stories about climate change and coastal communities in
Alaska, it has become increasingly common to recognise the 'buffering'
effect sea ice plays in mitigating the erosive damage done by winter
storms to coastlines. The intersection between shoreland, water and ice
is thus recognised as interstitial space; with a capacity to absorb and
deflect wave energy away from the rock, soil and sand of the coastline.
A reduction in multi-year sea ice with thinner annual or young sea ice
in turn reveals buffering limits; thicker sea ice being far more likely
to be able to absorb the energy associated with wave action. We see this
enacted in real time with the recent typhoon Merbok that moved through
the Bering Strait and left many coastal communities with damaged homes
and destroyed subsistence infrastructure. Another way sea ice scientists
have framed sea ice is to posit it as a 'lid' to acidification, which is
caused by the ocean becoming saturated with carbon dioxide emissions.
Younger sea ice in particular being less able to act as a 'lid' to both
warming and amplification trends. With less sea ice, open water is
better able to absorb heat and disrupt in turn the relationship between
water, ice and air. Acidifying waters have direct implications for
future biodiversity, as some creatures including shell-building
organisms cannot tolerate acidification beyond a certain degree of
concentration. As Cheryl Katz (2019) noted in her investigation of the
acidification:

But as marine carbon levels climb, more and more carbonate ions are
being used up, lowering the ocean\'s ability to buffer, and causing
acidity---measured as a drop in pH---to rise. Those same carbonate ions
are needed by creatures like starfish and clams, whose shells or
skeletons are made of the calcium carbonate minerals aragonite or
calcite ... Melting away the ocean\'s icy lid exposes yet more water to
take up yet more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The acidification of Arctic waters has direct implications for local and
Indigenous fishing and shellfish harvesting in coastal Alaska, with the
fastest rate of acidification occurring in the Beaufort Sea and Bering
Sea. Acidification affects growing seasons for molluscs and crustaceans,
reproduction rates and species distribution (for example, clams and
crabs). What the analogy of the 'buffer' does is to highlight energy
transfer rather than simply assume 'disappearance' of sea ice per se.
The relationship between land, sea and air in the Arctic reveals well
the 'vertical reciprocity' between the three, as more open water means
more heat absorption, rising air and water temperatures, greater
acidification and diminishment of multi-year ice (Adey, 2010).

Second, sea ice and its relationship to scientific-military imaginaries
and practices reveals polar waters to be hazard rather than buffer---an
obstacle to unfettered mobility. Contemporary iterations of Arctic
geopolitics owe their poignancy to earlier antecedents. During the Cold
War, sea ice was conceptualised as a barrier to movement (Roberts,
2015). A slippery subject that would prove a difficult adversary for
submarine captains as rival naval forces. Countries such as Canada
established national ice services in the 1950s to provide further
coverage and assessment for shipping users. [Sea ice research, and for
that matter permafrost science, was in part funded by national
governments to enable and improve awareness and understanding of
ice-covered waters and cold environments (and Indigenous knowledges and
expertise enrolled if often under-acknowledged). In the military arena,
institutions such as the Office of Naval Research and the US Arctic
Submarine Laboratory in Barrow Alaska were charged with funding research
that sought to make ice more knowable, predictable and
governable.]{.underline} And yet the memoirs of US nuclear submarine
captains and published research on sea ice revealed the opposite---sea
ice was and is notoriously dynamic, confusing and unsettling to those
seeking to go under it, transit it at the surface and/or break through
from below (for example, McLaren, 2008). [Depending on seasonality, wind
direction, ocean temperatures and currents, militaries and scientists
were involved in a host of national and international initiatives
designed to improve seasonal charting, environmental management plans,
strategic patrols, and resource extractions plans.]{.underline} Richard
Powell\'s work on Canadian scientific authority in the 1950s illustrates
well the manner in which sea ice was caught up with sovereign and
security agendas (Powell, 2017).

Coastal states such as Russia and Canada were also eager to ensure that
their ice-covered waters were properly protected---environmentally and
legally---from transit traffic (Steinberg et al., 2015). In the 1960s
and 1970s, Canadian governments in particular were alarmed by the
prospect of US oil tanker traffic going backwards and forwards from
Alaska via the Northwest Passage. The presence of sea ice acted as a
politically helpful shipping hazard and thus possible deterrent to
foreign-registered ships wishing to cross through waters the Canadian
authorities considered to be 'historic' rather than subject to transit
rights. While Canada put in place additional environmental regulatory
safe-guarding measures (for example, the 1970 Arctic Waters Pollution
Prevention Act), the Northwest Passage remains a source of official
legal disagreement between Canada and the United States. Diminishing sea
ice, thus, acts as a catalyst for speculation about whether this
waterway might become a source of future friction either because the
waters are thought to be in principle less hazardous (a point that is
often contested by shipping and sea ice experts alike) or because
relevant details of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS
and Article 234) for 'ice-covered areas' are thought to be less relevant
in operational terms. As the Article in question

Coastal States have the right to adopt and enforce non-discriminatory
laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction and control of marine
pollution from vessels in ice-covered areas within the limits of the
exclusive economic zone, where particularly severe climatic conditions
and the presence of ice covering such areas for most of the year \[i.e.
6 months and one day\] create obstructions or exceptional hazards to
navigation, and pollution of the marine environment could cause major
harm to or irreversible disturbance of the ecological balance.

Article 234 was the only example of where UNCLOS recognised the presence
of ice-covered areas. Later the UN body the International Maritime
Organisation\'s Polar Code (entered into force in 2017) sets out
requirements for shipping entering and leaving polar waters. While
acknowledging that coastal communities 'in the Arctic could be, and that
polar ecosystems are, vulnerable to human activities, such as ship
operation' (emphasis added, Polar Code 2017). While the Polar Code noted
a 'could be' for possible impacts on Arctic coastal communities of
climate change, it addresses the operational challenges posed by sea ice
with considerable assertiveness. [Sea ice is framed throughout as a
technical problem that can be mitigated by collective action. Solutions
to sea ice will emerge through legal, technological and training
interventions.]{.underline}

[Third, sea ice as register of global rather than local or Indigenous
futures. When coastal communities in Alaska are posited as on the
frontline of climate change, sea ice and permafrost are spectacularised
in the sense of being made to stand for a harbinger of an unwanted
global future (Bronen,]{.underline} 2010[). There is often a slippage
between the everyday and local and the global and planetary. What gets
lost in this slippage is the notion that ice/frost/snow become caught up
in an extractive economy which prioritises the ramifications for
extra-territorial parties, global elemental spaces and the 'buffering'
affordances of ice and frozen ground.]{.underline} The Arctic is in
crisis primarily because it will not keep its frozen ground frozen and
its sea ice intact. The very thing that Cold War frontier engineers
dreamed of annihilating is now being cursed for not being resilient
enough (Fleming, 2010). We further assert for a ground to articulate an
Arctic that does not lose the verifiable danger and precarity of ice
melt and the livelihoods that continue to be changed, transformed and
dispossessed, which is largely consequential from the enactments of
racial capitalism but that also holds a refusal to fall victim to an
alarmist, polemical, devastation and declensionist narrative. [The
declensionist narrative is one that has been historical and often
wielded to discuss Indigenous peoples and their inevitable disappearance
conveniently from resource rich areas.]{.underline} [Care must be taken
when reporting the disappearance of ice]{.underline}. As Inupiaq poet
Joan Naviyuk Kane writes:

[Much of the discourse around the Arctic and Indigenous people
preoccupies itself with destruction ... It is couched in either the
concrete documentation of disappearance---erosion or submersion of land
due to climate change or climate-caused displacement, for instance---or
in the figurative language of loss (cited in Nunatsiaq
News,]{.underline} 2018[)]{.underline}

Taking up Kane\'s project, is there a way to identify the enactments of
colonialism without a spectacularised event of damage, loss and the
horror of that loss, as the vessel of discussion? And is it possible to
have that conversation without lioning Indigenous resilience as a
life-lesson for non-indigenous peoples elsewhere? As Eve Tuck and C. Ree
put it:

[Damage narratives are the only stories that get told about me, unless
I\'m the one that\'s telling them. People have made their careers on
telling stories of damage about me, about communities like mine. Damage
is the only way that monsters and future ghosts are conjured (Tuck and
Ree,]{.underline} 2013[)]{.underline}

### L---Security

#### The production and management of death is the constitutive fabric of a model of security that is never secure. Thus, the 1AC's hype-based security discourse merely creates an extraordinary narrative of American heroism that obscures the ordinary violence of necropolitical death-making that sustains the regime of American power. 

**Debrix 23** (François Debrix, Professor of Political Science at
Virgina Tech; 9-12-23; "Necropolitics and American Hype-Power", DOI:
10.21061/spectra.v10i1.236) -- Langham EY

Similarly, of late, [**regimes of US-based hyped-up security and
insecurity** have been **concerned with the production and management of
a mode of necro-power characterized by a proliferation** and deepening
**of endemic death** and death making.]{.underline} From immigrant
bodies at the US border, along the treacherous paths and journeys
leading them to the border, or even after they have entered the United
States' territory to the tens of thousands of collateral civilian
victims of the US War on Terror (and later, of the crusade against
Islamic fundamentalism) [during the occupations of Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.underline}, as a result of the Bush-initiated and later
Obama-supported US drone warfare campaigns, [and through the ongoing
fight against terrorism]{.underline} (ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc.) in the
Middle East and Africa, [endemic **necro-power and US hype in security
and foreign policy matters** seem to **have gone hand in
hand.**]{.underline} Either purposefully (by directly targeting bodies
and populations that must be surrendered to endemic death) or, perhaps
more frequently, through ignorance, negligence, indifference, or
incompetence, early-21^st^ century US hype-power has been a way of
relinquishing to death whose main effect has been to target some bodies
and populations that nonetheless must be invisible, unnoticed, or made
to disappear, often because their invisibility, neglect, or
disappearance gives credence or is convenient to regimes of hype-power.

is less and less a guarantee (since hype requires that power, even when
exaggerated or overshot, be seen and publicized), [hype-power's
production of endemic death is always risky.]{.underline} Indeed, as
much as it is (and must be) spectacularly and brashly announced,
depicted, recounted, and displayed, [US hype-power's strategies and
their turn to endemic necro-power are constantly at risk or threatened.
They are always potentially undermined at the same time as they are
triumphantly exposed, since hype-power cannot always manage to keep the
bodies and populations it hopes to make invisible and
superfluous]{.underline} (and that it sacrifices to endemic death)
simultaneously invisible and superfluous. In fact, [**as a result of its
exaggeration, excess, or overshooting, US hype-power produces** more and
more **conditions of endemic decay, dispossession, and death,** more and
more **insecurities**]{.underline}, sometimes amongst its own
population, that increasingly cannot be ignored. In a way, this is the
key paradox of today's US hype-power regimes and strategies.

At the same time, in a time of hype, when invisibilityInternational
relations scholarship is often insufficient, inadequate, or indeed
incompetent (sometimes conveniently so) when it comes to articulating
the paradox of contemporary American insecurity, or, in other words,
when trying to make sense of why the more the United States hypes up its
power, prowess, and strength, the more vulnerable, precarious, and
exposed to necro-power and endemic deaths populations---including the US
population---can be and often are. Outside of international relations,
the work of some critical anthropologists, critical geographers, and
critical humanities scholars in fields such as literary studies,
cultural studies, race and gender studies, and American studies has been
useful in teasing out the implications of the connections between
American power and death making.^27^ In particular, insights offered by
cultural anthropologist and critical ethnographer Zoe Wool have been
productive in helping to make sense of what I have called the paradox of
US hype-power. In her 2015 book, *After War*,^28^ Wool provides a
detailed account of the "lives," including the affective interactions,
of US soldiers who have returned wounded or traumatized from the US wars
in the Middle East and are being treated---and often left to linger
until healing or recovery takes place, if it ever does, or until death
arrives---at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
There, at Walter Reed (but also at several other Veterans Affairs
hospitals and in private homes throughout the United States where
wounded and traumatized soldier bodies have to find a way to live on), a
limbo zone, a zone located somewhere between life and death, a space of
endemic suffering, destitution, poverty, despair, or illness, comes into
view, at least if one cares to look at it. As Wool notes, in this zone
or space of necro-power (since life is no longer about fullness, and
death is often a possible outcome, sometimes an always anticipated
reality), "the fragmentary character of life here and now is a way of
being that is saturated by devastation and ruin." She adds: "Soldiers
have moved on from the place of war, but they still live with it, often
literally carrying pieces of it with them."^29^

Through her ethnographic accounts, interspersed with critical
theoretical reflections on the meaning of life/living in necro-political
contexts derived from the writings of Foucault and Mbembe, but also of
feminist decolonial scholars like Elizabeth Povinelli,^30^ Veenas
Das,^31^ and Jasbir Puar,^32^ [Wool juxtaposes American
hype-power]{.underline}---here, [the United States' War on Terror
rhetorics from the past two decades, the inflated claims about US global
geopolitical dominance, the mantra about America's unmatched military
feats and its soldier heroes returning home to great
acclaim]{.underline}---[to necro-power and to the reality of endemic
insecurity and death vulnerability that has been the fate of many,
whether they are soldiers or not, Americans or not, over the last 20 to
25 years of US hyped-up security politics.]{.underline} Wool deploys a
term or concept that tries to capture this mundane conflation of US
hype-power with US necro-power: the "extra/ordinary."^33^ [The
"extra/ordinary" describes the limbo zone where wounded and traumatized
bodies reside.]{.underline}

But I believe that [the "extra/ordinary" is also the name that one can
give to the condition of endemic precarity and often death making today,
when forgotten or **invisibilized bodies** and lives are **always
already on the threshold of destruction, when the heroes or champions of
America's hype-power become the incarnation of its necro-power**, and
when the hyped-up renditions of US power, force, and security produce
superfluous and sacrificed bodies that are abandoned to]{.underline} a
life that is no longer quite a life but is also not yet death (perhaps a
[slow death]{.underline}, in a way). Or, to quote Wool, the
"extra/ordinary" can help us to "explore what it is like to be blown up
as an American soldier and to then be pulled toward an ideal American
ordinary of non-soldiering life, while stuck in a place that, for all
its proliferating claims about the injured soldier as a hero... seems to
protest so much that all possibilities of life are called frighteningly
into question."^34^

[The "extra/ordinary,"]{.underline} I suggest, [is what binds hype-power
and necro-power together.]{.underline} Here, [the "extra" in
hype-power's excess, exaggeration, extravagance, or over-extended public
displays and claims of]{.underline}, and about, [**heroic exploits
meets** and reveals **the "ordinary" of necro-power's endemics** and
slow death. Bodies and **populations**]{.underline}---even those that
have been designated to be some of the main agents of the USA's
hype-power---[are **primed to become vulnerable**, superfluous, and
killed]{.underline} (or, at least, ignored and forgotten, and thus
condemned to social abandonment and disappearance). Over the past few
years, [**in the wake of** **America's wars on terror**]{.underline}
(although these wars have never really ended, of course), [other sites
and other conditions of "extra/ordinariness" have
materialized.]{.underline}

For example, since February-March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has
allowed us to uncover quite a few dimensions of US hype-power, and
crucially of US hype-power's connections to necro-power. As medical
humanities scholar Erik Larsen has argued, Covid-19, in the United
States and in many other places too, has been characterized by the
combination of the pandemic logic (that is to say, the exceptional, the
unexpected, the spectacularly viral, but also the hype of media and
public discourses about it) with an endemic logic (the common, the
ordinary, the banal, the pernicious, the long-lasting or ever present),
at least in the domains of epidemiology and public health.^35^ But this
combination of the pandemic with the endemic is true to the social and
political spheres as well. In the United States, during the first two
years of the pandemic, the hype about the security threats presented by
the coronavirus (often cast by pundits and politicians as a national and
geopolitical security threat as much as a human or health security
matter) often gave way to more heightened forms of hype-power, whether
it was about fighting and defeating an enemy sent to the United States
by China (the "China virus") or, as Trump claimed over and over, about
having controlled and pretty much vanquished the pandemic on US soil
(Trump's repeated claims that the United States had finally "turned the
corner," that the United States under his watch was testing more
individuals for Covid-19 on a per capita basis than any other country in
the world, that his efforts had led directly to the creation and launch
of new vaccines that would save Americans, or that he had managed to
rescue the US economy by "keeping it open" throughout the crisis).
Moreover, soon after Biden took over the presidency, the hyped-up
discourses about the pandemic continued, particularly around the
effectiveness and superiority of the US-made vaccines, which would
become the pathways to returning the United States and the world to a
sense of normality (and, crucially, to business as usual).

The flip side, however, of the hyped-up and sometimes extravagant
statements and beliefs about the virus, its security threats, or the
vaccines has been the realization that many Americans---the poor, racial
minorities, the elderly---have been exposed to endemic abandon, to poor
health, and to death for decades, if not for generations, abandoned to
conditions of vulnerability and insecurity that Covid-19 did not create,
but certainly exacerbated and brought to public light. Referring to
Foucault's work on biopower and endemics, Larsen writes that "American
'endemic' biopolitics remain\[s\] consistent with its 'pandemic'
variety: those already 'allowed to die' in American life perish rapidly
and en masse because the state has long exposed them to conditions
leading to poor health."36 Indeed, the low quality of the US healthcare
system for many Americans, the lack of decent (or any) health insurance
for many, the absence of readiness, planning, or preparation of many
health districts and hospital systems throughout the United States
(including a lack of vital medical equipment and protective gear for
doctors and nurses), bureaucratic gridlock in federal agencies (starting
with the CDC and the FDA), and the disastrous conditions of quite a few
nursing homes and long term-care facilities are some of the forms that
the pandemic's necro-power have taken in the United States. Hype-power's
assurances, in both the health security and the geopolitical security
domains, have been that the United States possesses the most advanced
medical system in the world, with the best doctors, the most prestigious
medical institutions and research facilities, and the most cutting-edge
and successful biotech and pharmaceutical companies and products. But
all these have been typically accessible to or have primarily benefitted
the wealthier Americans, the biologically fit, and the already healthy.
In a way, the triumph and proclaimed superiority of the American
biomedical, perhaps even healthcare, model---and crucially the hype
about it---has been based both on the good health, the good biological
condition of the healthy and wealthy, but also on the poor health of and
absence of proper healthcare for the less wealthy and the less able. The
economic, educational, and infrastructural investment away from
universal healthcare, away from certain groups, away from certain areas
of the country (some inner-city neighborhoods, some rural zones), away
from certain health conditions (even if pernicious or endemic) is, in
large part, what has allowed the US medical and health science research
and economic sectors to do well and, in some cases, to thrive so as to
achieve what some have claimed is global medical prowess and prestige.
This is what the hype has been about, but also what it has sought to
occlude. And this is also not a very new story. Recent hyped-up
rhetorics about defeating the virus or making America's economy and
national security "great again" are not the only culprits here. In fact,
at some level, US hype-power, under Trump in particular, has been a
symptom of a long established system of hype, exaggeration, and
extravagance in public health matters that provides security (and
healthy life and living conditions) to some, while it condemns other
groups and individuals to continuous poor health and poor living
conditions (including malnutrition and hunger, for example), to
vulnerability to viruses, to lack of access to basic medical treatment
and care, to social insecurities, and to endemic death making. Here
again, we can see that, through the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, American
hype-power is closely tied to American necro-power. If nothing else,
beyond the absurdity of many US hyped-up renditions of the coronavirus,
Covid-19 has revealed some of the holes in the US model of over-inflated
foreign policy, national security politics, and (geo)politics more
generally as it may now become a bit more difficult for the US
government (as well as local governments) to ignore the fact that
America's seeming good health is actually dependent upon the endemic bad
health and, sometimes, the exposure to death of quite a few individuals,
and not just outside US borders, but within the United States too.

As the Covid-19 pandemic years have shown us, [endemic death and
necro-power are not antithetical to US hype-power. Rather, **US
hype-power and US necro-power**]{.underline} are "extra/ordinary." They
[**go hand-in-hand.**]{.underline} And [**hyping is also about
occluding**, ignoring, or denying the various commonplace **regimes of
death-making**, the multiple death-worlds and their daily
vulnerabilities, **that have been caused by US power, at home and
abroad**, and that US power]{.underline} (whether we choose to call it
super, hyper, or hype) [relies on to produce and maintain the
extravagance, the exaggeration, or the rhetorical excess.]{.underline}
But perhaps, [as hype-power's pairing with endemic death-making becomes
less and less easy to hide, as more and more bodies are made insecure
and exposed to necro-politics, **the specter of US political decline,
blowback, or imperial decay will not remain a specter for long and will
be seen for the real security and foreign policy tragedy
that**]{.underline}, in many ways, **[it already is.]{.underline}**

The role of surveillance in society: social sorting

Whilst some literature suggests that surveillance is simply the capture
of personal information, [Lyon contends that surveillance is a strategy
of social control, and that its purpose is to "influence or manage those
whose data have been garnered"]{.underline} (Lyon, 2001). [In this way,
surveillance functions as a process of "social sorting"]{.underline}
(Lyon, 2003), where surveillance capacities are used to collect data,
categorise, classify, evaluate and ultimately assign individuals and
groups an identity in relation to the normative white (or other dominant
race or ethnicity), middle-aged, middle-class, able-bodied,
cis-gendered, heterosexual male (Lyon, 2005; Marx, 2005).

[Historical accounts of colonisation reveal that surveillance was
essential for the classification of people and the control of newly
acquired territories]{.underline} (Zuriek, 2013). From the 14th to the
19th century, European colonists amassed vast quantities of data on the
populations they colonised. [The foundations of modern-day biometrics,
such as fingerprinting, census taking, map-making and profiling, were
refined and implemented in colonial setting]{.underline}s (Zureik,
2013). I[nformation gathered via surveillance was used by European
governments to classify populations according to innate biological
traits, and construct racial hierarchies based on flawed notions of
"scientific racism", both in the colonies and at home]{.underline}
(Brown & Barganier, 2018). In Australia, white colonisers used these
theories of white supremacy to justify violence such as massacres of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, land theft, removal of
children from families, and erasure of language and culture (Anderson &
Perrin, 2008).

[Systems of surveillance have been instrumental in creating and
reinforcing the social identities, divisions, and hierarchies that shape
contemporary society]{.underline} (Gandy 1993; Lyon 2003). This is most
apparent in the logics that construct the 'criminal'. Colonial racial
taxonomies formed the basis for the modern study of 'deviance', a core
concept of the scholarly field of Criminology (Brown & Barganier, 2018).
[Deviance is based on a "constant division between the normal and the
abnormal"]{.underline} (Foucault, 1977) [so that groups can be "sorted
by levels of dangerousness"]{.underline} (Feely and Simon 1994). Harsha
Walia, in her book Undoing Border Imperialism observes that "criminals
are never imagined as

politicians, bankers, corporate criminals, or war criminals, but as a
racialised class of people living in poverty. The word criminal becomes
synonymous with dehumanising stereotypes of ghettos, welfare recipients,
drug users, sex workers, and young gang members" (2013). The
criminalisation of migration intensified in the aftermath of the attacks
of 9/11 in New York and Washington DC (Akkerman, 2016; Lyon, 2003). The
construction and reinforcement of race-based categories (Finn, 2005) as
a potential threat (for example, Arab and Muslim men) justified a suite
of new global counter-terrorism policies, legislation and the
strengthened power of police and intelligence forces (Pellerin, 2005).
[Surveillance serves as a technique to create and sustain borders
through defining the grounds for exclusion and inclusion]{.underline}
(Marx, 2005), such as citizenship criteria that determines who does or
does not belong as a full member of a nation-state (Lyon, 2005). [In
addition to the ability to admit or exclude, today surveillants --
whether at an airport, a welfare office, or a credit card company --
have the responsibility of defining people as normal or deviant,
desirable or undesirable, safe or risky, citizen or threat, healthy or
diseased]{.underline}. These definitions have profound effects on the
freedom of those individuals (Finn, 2005; Lyon, 2005; Marx, 2005). In
this way, surveillance plays a central role in reproducing inequality,
creating a hierarchy of access to various social, political, or economic
benefits (Lyon, 2005).

[Achille Mbembe describes the brutality of borders as an embodiment of
"necropolitics", which he defines as the "ultimate expression of
sovereignty... the power and capacity to dictate who is able to live and
who must die]{.underline}" (2019). Social sorting, and its power to
"kill, to let live, or to expose to death" will remain a central feature
of contemporary society and only be strengthened through the development
of surveillance technologies (Mbembe, 2019; Lyon, 2005).

Neoliberalisation, growing corporate power and border security

[Colonial racial hierarchies were the primary structuring principle of
the capitalist world economy]{.underline} which laid the foundation for
the lasting rift between parts of the world categorised broadly as
Global North and Global South1 (Hoogvelt, 1997).

### L---Terrorism

#### 1AC terror scenarios are an outgrowth of the over securitized war on terror, which the dominant white sovereignty uses as justification to entrench nonwhite and Muslim populations in violent necropolitical systems.

Islamophobia, surveillance, refugee, and institutional racism, 8/4/2021,

[Farooque described in Chapter 2 that racism is crucial to the
performance of the 'war on terror' and its legitimation. Similarly,
Leila locates the 'war on terror' within a white supremacist system
whereby the normative white subject occupies the position of fully human
with the power to rule over 'the rest,' reducing natives to "second
class citi- zens" and taking away their resources in keeping with
colonialism.]{.underline} Leila's account depicts how necropolitics and
[necropower are deployed to produce 'death-worlds,' which Mbembe (2003:
40, original italics) defines as 'new and unique forms of social
existence in which vast popu- lations are subjected to conditions of
life conferring upon them the status of *living dead.'* Racism
designates the biological caesura.]{.underline} As Arendt (1996: 157)
observes, 'race is, politically speaking, not the beginning of humanity
but its end,' heralding a 'politics of death' (Mbembe 2003: 17; also
Foucault 2004: 254--255) that functions to legitimise, even
inivisibilise Muslims' eradication, meaning the "loss of lives of
Muslims doesn't even count," as Leila testifies (see Butler 2004).
Racism is thus a fundamental technology for deciding upon death and
legitimising the state's murderous functions (Foucault 2004: 228[).
Leila perceives that racist behaviours have been sanctioned by the
actions of the state, informing a necropolitics (Mbembe 2003) that
presupposes Muslims' ultimate insecuritisation---death:]{.underline}

*Madeline*: So you think it's starting to get worse again?\
*Leila*: Yeah it's getting worse again. Basically the government's
already [doing what they're advocating. They're already killing Muslims,
that's what they're saying -- which is right.]{.underline}

Mbembe's (2003: 12) account of necropolitics invites us to imagine
'[poli- tics as a form of war' (see Foucault 2004: 239--263), posing the
question: 'What place is given to life, death, and the human body (in
particular the wounded or slain body)?]{.underline} How are they
inscribed in the order of power?' Similarly, Leila articulates
[sovereignty as a means of 'exercising the right to kill' (Mbembe 2003:
12) where, in this instance, Muslims' lives are deemed 'unlivable'
and/or 'ungrievable']{.underline} (Butler 2004): "\[the government is\]
already killing Muslims," which illustrates how a logic of war perme-
ates modern politics through security principles (Spieker 2011: 187).
Importantly, for Leila, state terror undergirds the precarity (Butler
2004) that Muslim populations experience, both domestically and
globally:

*Leila*: \[Muslims are\] just the target now with police shootings. It
just shows that society's not safe. And it's not a safe world. And even
when Palestine was attacked back in 2009 -- no one's been prosecuted
after that -- there's just been vicious genocide and they've been
massacred, it was on television and no one's been prosecuted. It just
shows that there's no justice.

*Madeline*: This idea of safety -- you actually feel unsafe?\
*Leila*: Yeah. It shows that it's an unsafe world. [And people can be
killed, attacked viciously and there's no prosecution. No one to bring
them to justice because it's been supported by the people who are in the
most powerful position whose responsibility is to protect]{.underline}.

As I discussed in Chapter 2, abjection works to separate 'unlivable' and
'uninhabitable' zones of social life (Butler 1993: 3). The fatal
shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes on the 22 July 2005 after he boarded
a train at Stockwell station in London that Leila refers to here
exemplifies how [necropolitics shape counter-terrorism measures through
both domestic and foreign policies within the 'war on terror'
context]{.underline} (also Chapter 3). Such measures reflect Garner's
(2007: 14) articulation of [whiteness as terror and supremacy in which
'the arbitrary imposition of life and death is one end of the spectrum
of power relations that whiteness enacts.']{.underline}

As with stop and search measures discussed earlier, such [necropolitical
policies are operative of a]{.underline} '[spatialisation of race'
(Pugliese 2006: 23) that affect which spaces can be safely traversed in
the course of the day. Police shootings underscore a racialised
distinction observed by Pugliese (2006: 15) between the 'normative white
corpus of the nation' to be protected and the 'racialised target of
hyper-surveillance' who is positioned in 'an *other* space' even whilst
they live and work within the 'civic spaces of the nation.']{.underline}
Those targeted as terror suspects experience everyday spaces of the
nation in a radically different way therefore to the self-evident
'native' so that civic spaces become 'spaces of uncivil danger'
(Pugliese 2006: 24).

The killing involved producing Menezes as a terror suspect through a
'police fantasy' comparable to what I am advancing as a premediated
ignorance, where, as Pugliese (2006: 4) contends, information was
'disseminated and reproduced as "fact"'; a transmutation which exempli-
fies a 'violent exercise of power' that works in conjunction with
practices of spatial control and dominance. As Nick Vaughan-Williams
(2007: 177, my italics) admonishes, lack of accountability is
'symptomatic of systemic features of Western politics' that importantly
are the means through which sovereign power 'secure\[s\] the *spatial
and temporal borders* of the sovereign political community.'

The extension of the logic of war within non-war zones through
integrating local knowledge practices and transnational security
initiatives reconfigures everyday lifeworlds (de Goede and Simon 2013:
317). Louise Amoore (2009: 55--56, original italics) argues that
data-led [security practices, which she terms 'algorithmic war,'
'\[reinscribe\] the imaginative geography of the deviant, atypical,
abnormal "other" *inside* the spaces of everyday life.']{.underline}
Central to Leila's account is the production of Gothic spaces of law
within spaces of exception where horrendous violences (Valier 2002)
occur without accountability because they are sanctioned by the state.
Arianna Vedashi (2018: 877, 924--925) similarly discusses the 'dark side
of counter-terrorism,' noting that the shift towards secrecy in
counter-terrorism practices enables concealment of government
wrongdoings which is inconsistent with the rule of law, meaning as Leila
notes, that the "responsibility to protect" is overturned. Violations of
human rights performed by public officials or intelligence agents are
not called to account. [Instead, security concerns are prioritised over
personal freedoms or human rights with particular dangers for Muslim
populations as the principle target of these measures.]{.underline}

Expansion and revision of law in a declared state of exception erodes
due process that safeguards suspects' rights within conventional
criminal justice proceedings. The extension of legal and administrative
measures for dealing with terror suspects shield prosecutions. As Kelly
Welch (2007: 136) observes, the '[notion of impunity' is significant
because it 'insulates state and executive power from accountability and
the rule of law, enhancing the likelihood that such abuses will persist
in an endless "war on terror."' For Leila, feelings of unsafety are not
confined to Britain, but comprise the geopolitical arena of state
terrors enacted against Muslim populations globally: "it's *not a safe
world* ."]{.underline}

### L---Warming

#### The 1AC's promise of "planetary salvation" from existential climate change serves as a justification for the borderless exercise of necropower against those deemed worthy of sacrifice in service of civilization. 

**DeBoom 21** (Meredith J. DeBoom, Assistant Professor of Geography at
the University of North Carolina; "Climate Necropolitics: Ecological
Civilization and the Distributive Geographies of Extractive Violence in
the Anthropocene"; Annals of the American Association of Geographers,
111:3, 900-912; DOI: 10.1080/24694452.2020.1843995) -- Langham EY

The suitability of necropolitics for analyzing the distribution and
legitimation of violence is enhanced by Mbembe's attention to where
necropolitical violence is enacted as well as against whom. His work
here builds on that of Fanon (1963), who in Wretched of the Earth
described the colonizer's per- spective on colonized neighborhoods as
follows: "\[t\]hey are born there, it matters little where or how; they
die there, it matters not where, nor how" (38, italics added).
Similarly, for Mbembe (2003), [colonized territories are "the zone where
the violence of the state of exception is deemed to operate in the
service of 'civilization'"]{.underline} (24). Contemporary [iterations
of these spaces---"death-worlds"]{.underline} in Mbembe's (2019, 92)
terminology---[are a spatial strategy through which sovereigns render
violence legitimate without outright colonization, because such
necropower is exercised not against subjects "here", but rather against
"savage" populations]{.underline} (the "living dead")
["there".]{.underline} In addition to immobilization ("the camp"),
sovereigns can exercise necropower through the spatial strategy of
"scattering" (Mbembe 2019, 86), as exemplified by the violence endured
by refugees and displaced persons (Davies, Isakjee, and Dhesi 2017). In
contrast to classical sovereign violence, which entails immediate death
for the individual, the disposability experienced by those relegated to
the status of the living dead rarely entails a quick demise. Rather than
immediate death for individuals at the hands of the sovereign,
death-worlds subject entire populations to extended conditions of
death-in-life.

Climate violence might be diffuse, but it is not randomly distributed.
[Whether through adaptation]{.underline} (K. J. Grove 2010; Thomas and
Warner 2019), [conflict]{.underline} (Raleigh, Linke, and O'Loughlin
2014), [or mitigation]{.underline} (Curley 2018; Mulvaney 2019;
Riofrancos 2019), [climate change often manifests as violence against
populations that have already been violently marginalized]{.underline}
(Sultana 2014). [Geographers have illustrated the value of necropolitics
for analyzing the uneven geographies of violence associated with
**colonial dispossession** **by** **conservation**]{.underline}
(Cavanagh and Himmelfarb 2015), **[chemical exposure]{.underline}**
(Davies 2018), **[nuclear imperialism]{.underline}** (Alexis-Martin
2019), [and **human--wildlife relations**]{.underline} (Margulies 2019),
among other environmental topics. In these cases, [state actors
exercised or allowed the exercise of necropower within the state's
territorial boundaries in the name of protecting the state's chosen
subject population.]{.underline} The planetary declaration of the
Anthropocene, however, challenges conceptualizations of environmental
sovereignty limited to territorial states (O'Lear and Dalby 2015). How
might this scalar shift affect the legitimation of necropolitical
violence and the geographies of its distribution?

Mann and Wainwright (2018) propose that **[climate change could provoke
the emergence of planetary sovereignty: a state of exception "proclaimed
in the name of preserving life on Earth"]{.underline}** (15). [**The
promise of planetary salvation is a powerful justification, one that a
sovereign could** seemingly use to **legitimate**]{.underline} an
extensive range of action, including **[violence.]{.underline}** Indeed,
although Mann and Wainwright (2018) do not engage explicitly with
Mbembe's necropolitics, they anticipate that **[planetary sovereignty
would entail the determination of "what measures are necessary and what
and who must be sacrificed in the interests of life on
Earth"]{.underline}** (15). By explaining how climate change could be
used to justify the rescaling of sovereignty, Mann and Wainwright have
identified a pathway through which [**climate change** could be **used
to legitimate the borderless exercise of climate necropower, rendering
some populations sacrificial so that others**--- and the
planet---**might live.**]{.underline} My argument builds on this pathway
by developing a framework, **[climate necropolitics]{.underline}**, for
identifying and analyzing the [processes, practices, discourses, and
**logics** through which Anthropocenic imaginaries can be **used to
render extractive violence legitimate within and beyond the borders of
the territorialized state in the name of planetary
salvation.**]{.underline} In the next section, I apply climate
necropolitics to the case study of Ecological Civilization to reveal how
Chinese and Namibian officials have leveraged this imaginary to justify
intensified necropolitical violence and, in so doing, have magnified the
unevenly distributed violence of climate change itself.

#### The racial capitalist-enslaving-colonial global order [weaponizes]{.underline} representations of [time]{.underline} in their narrative descriptions of the climate change crisis as an [urgent]{.underline}, impending threat requiring [human intervention]{.underline}, making timescales a [technology of governance]{.underline}.

Physicists, spiritual leaders, and theorists argue '**[time is not
real']{.underline}** (Martin, Citation2020; Rovelli, Citation2018).
[**It is a** 'human **construct**]{.underline} ... [to help us
differentiate between now and our perception of the past']{.underline}
(Martin, Citation2020). As a meaning that human groups have given to
change (Tabboni, Citation2001), it organizes our systems of thought and
our everyday lives. [Time has special meaning **in politics**, where
'the very distinction between **truth and fiction** has been made
**redundant**' so that **'the criterion is no longer accuracy -- it's
conformity to the needs of the moment'**]{.underline} (Klein,
Citation2014; emphasis added). Our present analytical and political
challenge is to grapple with the ways [**time is entangled with** the
'needs of the moment' in areas of **energy and climate
change**]{.underline}. Yet the politics of the ecological require
understanding time. [Notions like succession, simultaneity, **duration,
urgency, waiting, speed**, geological revolutions, **money, and death
are expressions of time** and are **entangled with the ecological** and
its models of development.]{.underline}

The increasing risks to the environment as a result of [the extraction
of conventional oil and natural gas resources and the increased
greenhouse emissions have led to]{.underline} what the experts have
called [the climate crisis. Yet]{.underline} as Klein says,
'[despite]{.underline} being convinced of [the necessity of
**addressing** our behavior as regards **energy consumption**,
collective consciousness **appears** at once **~~paralyzed~~
\[unchanged\] and indecisive**]{.underline} ... [frozen in the face of
the obstacle']{.underline} (Klein, Citation2014). Instead of **[frozen
time]{.underline}**, Bourriaud points to the acceleration of time and
what this has wrought: 'the great acceleration also lies within the
process of the naturalization of capitalism: now it has become both
organic and universal, it is the natural law of the Anthropocene' (cited
in Chiambaretta, Citation2017). Mbembe (Citation2021) expands this
argument of the relations of time with the planetary by arguing [**the
politics** and aesthetics **of the ecological require** understanding
the coloniality of power and its contemporary **temporal
mutations**.]{.underline} Imperial expansion, Mbembe argues, was (is) a
planetary project driven by nationalist states and companies to
reallocate the earth's resources through military might and
privatization. [**Colonial epistemes** and practices **of time block**
the potentiality and affirmation of **a planetary beyond capture and
conquest**]{.underline} (Marriott, Citation2011) but national
decolonization cannot be 'what gives deep breathing for the world'
(Mbembe, Citation2021). Some physicists speak of 'eternity in relation
to time', wherein 'atoms and the emptiness of the universe are infinite,
uncreated, and imperishable' (Oestreicher, Citation2012, p. 435). Others
speak of chronological and cyclical time, attributing the first to the
West and the latter to the East. Newton (1643--1727) defined time as a
mathematical variable with one dimension. The only two 'topological
objects with this characteristic' are a 'line and a circle ... . It thus
follows that time is either infinite or cyclic' (Oestreicher,
Citation2012, p. 436). Grappling with the question of social death,
Frank Wilderson argues that assembling black life into a series of
historical events, into a narrative with a plot 'is a catastrophe for
narrative at a meta-level rather than a crisis or aporia within a
particular narrative' (Wilderson, Citation2015b). For him,

> narrative time ... marks stasis and change within a \[human\]
> paradigm, \[but\] it does not mark the time of the \[human\] paradigm,
> the time of time itself, the time by which the slave's dramatic clock
> is set. For the slave, historical 'time' is not possible. (Wilderson,
> Citation2010, p. 339)

In this article I engage with two [dominant logics]{.underline}1 [and
grammars of time]{.underline},2 modernity, capitalism, and ecology:
[**time as linear,** flowing in a particular direction]{.underline}
(determined sequencing separable in measurable units), [**and time as
retrojection**, defined as 'a kind of projection that retrospectively
testifies to 'what comes before'']{.underline} (Walker, Citation2012, p.
268) [or after]{.underline}.3 Examining how [these two ideas of time
become **central to the co-production of the planetary as a colonial and
imperial project**]{.underline} will allow a structural engagement with
the emergence and generation of the conditions for decolonial planetary
relations as acts of invention (Fanon, Citation1967; Marriott,
Citation2014).

A Caribbean slave proverb, 'time is longer dan rope', challenges the
dominant notion of linear time and progress. The state and corporations
continue to expropriate black lives and indigenous lands, thus
'extract\[ing\] surplus from various processes of social and ecological
reproduction' (McGee & Greiner, Citation2020), including the
obliteration of lives. These structures of death are taken for granted,
including the colonial linear structures of progress and growth, their
contingent epistemic edifices and the privileges that shape and enable
social and ecological reproduction.

Generally speaking, [**temporal boundaries** are drawn to **render
climate change** or ecological crisis **theorizable**
within]{.underline} certain fields, such as [environmental, governance,
and conservation studies. However, that which is 'inside' or embodies a
temporal trajectory connotes what is present in the economy, while the
'outside' connotes a void (without time).]{.underline} Rather than
seeing contemporary readers as always irrevocably distanced from such
events, if those who write on climate change focus the language of time,
they may open up new possibilities for [**bringing to the fore**
substantial structures **whose temporality** or lived experience is
occluded or **does not** even **register as time**]{.underline}. In
fact, the pervasive tapestries of violence and their temporal structures
are challenged by theorists of black thought, indigenous studies,
postcolonialism, and Fanonian studies (Rifkin Citation2017; Wilderson
Citation2015a, Citation2015b, Citation2016; Fanon, Citation1967). They
challenge historical and linear time, orienting the reader toward a
reality that is neither graspable nor conquerable but a flickering
reality of sensed and unsensed 'actualities, the moment under the
moment' (Hoban, Citation1992). They problematize easy readings of
structures and dominant systems of thought and their entanglement with
notions of time, **[and]{.underline}** they query [**the collective
amnesia of** temporal productions and **racial
capitalist-enslaving-colonial global order** where]{.underline}, on the
one hand, things are written on water and evaporate (Shafak,
Citation2014, p. 2) and, on the other, [certain ecologies and lives are
dead on arrival.]{.underline}

[Modernist nationalist and capitalist iterations of time focus on
**linear teleologies**/eschatologies. This orientation of the temporal
**operates through causality**, stories of **progress** and **growth,**
the plausible and possible, **and ideas about** movement from **past to
present to future** and evolution]{.underline} (Wilk, Citation2007).
However, another orientation, retrojection, I argue, is vital to racial
ecological capitalism\'s dominant power. Without engaging with both of
these structures and operation of time simultaneously, we cannot
understand power and its entanglements with the planetary. The
temporality of capital's projection retrospectively testifies to what
comes before its current organizing. Retrojection requires us to
'relocate ourselves into the past', while 'assigning purposes and ends
to \[such\] actions' (Motzkin, Citation1992) as well as a mythical
agency to capital. [These]{.underline} two [expressions of
**temporality**]{.underline} co-exist, at times in tension. They [are
**inflected in** our **institutions and** our **social
life.**]{.underline}

In this piece, I look at the structure of time and ecology to trace how
social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences draw on such
structures to colonize, enslave, and imperialize the planetary. I trace
how and when [time and **temporality bound the
Anthropocene**]{.underline}. The search is not for a start date but for
the ways [**the 'date' or the 'when'** is a political, economic,
scientific, and ethical question]{.underline} (Davis & Todd,
Citation2017, p. 761; Rifkin Citation2017; Whyte, Citation2017;
Saldanha, Citation2020) [**entangled with** the structure of time
and]{.underline} what Fanon calls the invention or new beginning beyond
global capital's projects. I draw on a 2018 report from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and work by Naomi
Oreskes and Erik M. Conway to register [**the co-production** of the
temporal with 'the domains **of nature, facts, objectivity,
reason** ... **policy \[and\] culture, values, subjectivity, emotions
and politics'**]{.underline} (Jasanoff, Citation2004, p. 12).4 I use
these works as a springboard for thinking how this temporal
co-production expresses the tension between the reproduction of capital
and the generation of life. To conclude the piece, in conversation with
Octavia E. Butler, I suggest instead of dreading an impending crisis, we
should read radically for the ruptures in the dominant structures of
time (i.e. in narratives, dialectics, etc.) (Marriott, Citation2011;
Wilderson, Citation2010) and their entanglement with questions of the
planetary and climate change. Such fractal readings may yield insights
into possible disinvestment from the fossil economy and open up the
possibility for an indeterminate world, the passionate and living
experimenting with and harnessing of the flux of energy into a vision of
a decolonial whose basic premise is not conquest and enslavement.

Liberalism: always too late, or capitalism's colonial and enslaving
proactivity?

[**In the IPCC reports, time as a linear** human orientation **is placed
in** the context of **timescales of forces** **requiring human
intervention** but out of human control: climate change]{.underline}.
The recent SRl.5 (IPCC, Citation2018), ['**Global Warming of**
**1.5°C'**, representing the 'newer instalment of the scientisation of
climate change', **situates** 'the issue]{.underline} beyond democratic
debate by declaring it a matter for the scientific expertise of the
IPCC', and inscribes it [as an **emergency**]{.underline} (Garrard,
Citation2020, p. 1). [The report suggests 'climate change is moving
faster than we are']{.underline} (Masson-Delmotte et al., Citation2018,
p. v), [and its urgency demands our intervention]{.underline}. However,
[the moral and ethical articulation of the climate as a **linear
temporal 'urgency' does not** allow us to **understand** ecological
shifts or even **climate change in a larger trajectory**, including
human conquest, property relations, and competition. Rather, the
report's 'foreshortened timeframe' speaks to the urgent need of global
concerted efforts to mitigate climate change **and signals how temporary
responses** and procrastination **are not going to do the
trick**]{.underline} (Garrard, Citation2020, p. 2).

John Mecklin, Editor of Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, similarly reminds
us that time is running out:

> Faced with this daunting threat landscape and a new willingness of
> political leaders to reject the negotiations and institutions that can
> protect civilization over the long term, the Bulletin of the Atomic
> Scientists Science and Security Board today moves the Doomsday Clock
> 20 s closer to midnight - closer to apocalypse than ever. (Mecklin,
> Citation2020)

[The **moving** of **the clock makes the 'climate emergency' public**,
especially for those proponents of liberalism whose 'macroscopic
exclusion clauses']{.underline} have been written to
['displace]{.underline} ... [unfreedom' onto all marginalized,
enslaved,]{.underline} and [colonized peoples **and**]{.underline} those
['primitive' and 'undeveloped' sites ']{.underline}from a white male
bourgeois European who was the historical agent in the narrative' (Mann,
Citation2019). Yet [this moving of the clock]{.underline} does not
address the root of the problem. It [**allows** the positing of **a
secular/humanist eschatological story**]{.underline} (Rothe,
Citation2020, p. 162) [whose temporal structure is one **of immanent
destruction**, informed by an analysis of existence as
being-towards-death (i.e. of the human and the planet) or
catastrophe.]{.underline}

Of course, [this schematic presumes death and ecological catastrophe
(collapsed into one). It represents a never-reached horizon of
experience, **where** authentic and moral **decisions must be** made
**through a** theory or **'concept of crisis** or
emergency]{.underline}' (Mann, Citation2019). Liberal leaders of the
international political system 'inch toward' an implementation of a
regulatory system, what Mann and Wainwright call climate Leviathan,
[**instead of addressing the root causes** of global
warming]{.underline}. These [leaders]{.underline} are not creative but
'[fumble ... for solutions', continuing to argue that 'climate change'
is a 'market failure, without considering the limiting structures of the
'market' itself]{.underline} (Osaka, Citation2019, p. 2; citing Mann &
Wainwright, Citation2018). [When the moment for organized challenge
emerges, **white hegemony** rushes to squander the creative energy and
**reorients social relations toward** its **consolidation.** It does so
**by rushing to innovate through** the co-production of **narratives**
and an emerging ecological order.]{.underline}

The present as a fracture of notions of history and 'historical natures'

[**Apocalypse is 'the** single **most powerful** master **metaphor
that** the contemporary environmental imagination has at its
disposal']{.underline} (Buell, Citation1995, p. 285). As such, [it
**deranges capital and its entanglements with ecological problems**,
ranging from the climate change, to the extinction of species, the loss
of pollinating insects, and other ecological disasters.]{.underline}
These challenges or this ecology of environmental concerns cannot be
considered in a partitioned manner.

The focus on temporality has been picked up by historians and others
grappling with what the authors of [the Anthropocene]{.underline} name a
crisis and emergency. One text that [speaks to the global **climate
change as apocalyptic temporality**]{.underline} is Oreskes and Conway's
The Collapse of Western Civilization. In theorizing the present and the
temporal possibilities for the future otherwise, these authors open the
door for us to experiment with what Sheila Jasanoff and Sang-Hyun call
socio­technical imaginaries (Citation2013). The book's narrator is a
Chinese historian in the year 2393. The historian says Western
civilization possessed robust information about climate change and the
'damaging events to unfold' but was 'unable to stop' them (Oreskes &
Conway, Citation2014, p. x, pp. 1-2), thus 'condemning their successors
to the inundation and desertification of the late twenty-first and
twenty-second centuries' (Oreskes & Conway, Citation2014, pp. 59--60). A
second Dark Age descended, and the Period of Penumbra began. The present
ignorance, the historian says, is a result of an 'ideological fixation
on 'free' markets; another compartmentalization and the practice among
the scientific community of demanding an excessively stringent standard
for accepting claims of any kind, even those involving imminent threats'
(Oreskes & Conway, Citation2014, pp. ix-x). In a sense, [this future
scenario **tells nothing** **about the future and more about the
'present'** -- our moment.]{.underline}

However, the narrator's historical account is problematic and, as
Garrard argues 'unequivocably dangerous', as the scenario focuses on
'catastrophic outcomes' (Garrard, Citation2020, p. 3). Gallard's
critique is important to our discussion of temporality. Narrating the
present as a given history evades uncertainty and possibilities for the
world as a project beyond global capital. In a sense, [**this dystopian
temporality** **posits itself as** the '**truth'** of our reality as if
**punctuating a certain** kind of **imaginary temporal orientation** --
the only one about the future.]{.underline} This depicted history
anticipates the failure of the future by drawing on assembled empirics
and technologies of problem-solving as if failure and the future are not
up for debate (Jasanoff, Citation2019), as if the historical codes and
genre choices that assemble these dystopia future scenarios are not
'originary' to the familiar narratives of history which they ground.

In highlighting that [the Anthropocene is]{.underline} actually [a
'liberal managerial term']{.underline}, Mann (Citation2019) suggests the
ideology of [**liberalism distorts** the multiple social reproductions
of **violence and** strategies of **failure** by sublimating them
**through temporal means**, deploying concepts **such as crises,
emergencies**, and exceptions, **and** substituting **adaptation** for
progress]{.underline}. We see this in scientific reports, for example,
the SRl.5 and others; while they address the metabolic rifts and shifts,
they still use the Anthropocene as the social contract (Mann,
Citation2019). In Climate Leviathan, Joel Wainwright and Geoff Mann
argue [crisis, risk, and uncertainty are asymmetrical, the result of the
actions of a minority of humanity, i.e. the white male bourgeois
European who claims the agency and writing of the historical narrative
of liberalism and imperial capitalism. The Anthropocene is a technology
co-productive of temporal regimes of modernity and the planetary
order:]{.underline}

> [\[**The Anthropocene is\] an explicitly future facing instrument of
> temporal power**. Like all contracts, **it restarts time** on its
> terms. The distribution of responsibilities it represents is always
> also the closure of supersession of past arrangements]{.underline}.
> So, **[a contract that has no expiration]{.underline}**, like a
> constitution or the Anthropocene, is supposed to mark the end of the
> past and the beginning of a new time. (Mann & Wainwright,
> Citation2018, p. 8)

[The Anthropocene is itself a technology of temporal power which orders
and organizes social life]{.underline}. In questioning this contract,
Mann and Wainwright problematize how [**time is used to organize global
power**.]{.underline} They question whether the idea that the
Anthropocene marks the end of the past as many claim and the beginning
of a new time is accurate. For them, [**this fetishization** of the
Anthropocene **evades** the **intensifying challenges** to the world.
The structure of '**transition**' of the contemporary global order **and
the** production of **history of liberalism as progress**]{.underline}
(Mann & Wainwright, Citation2018, p. 9) [are problematic and **do not
acknowledge how** such kinds of **politics are co-produced with** a
structure of **transcendental time as their** major procedural
**technology of governance**]{.underline}. The transformation of the
world's political economy and the fundamental political arrangements
most people take for granted thus need to be engaged on the register of
the language of temporal power and the global order.

### !---Extinction

#### Necro-ontology outweighs and overturns the case: under hegemonic enclosure, necro-desire economies culminate in extinction.

**Batalla, 23** (Invisible Extinction: Fragility and the Extinction of
the Self in Neoliberal Societies, Oriol Batalla a PhD candidate in
Social and Cultural Theory at the Center for the Study of Culture,
Politics, and Society University of Barcelona, Spain, Annali di Ca'

Hence, [if]{.underline} one [consider]{.underline}s
[economy]{.underline} and [politics]{.underline} to be a cultural
construction **[and ontology as "the most fundamental assumption that
one makes about the world"]{.underline}** (Uzondu 2013, 327),
**[ontology is to be regarded as a core part of culture]{.underline}**.
In other words, **["culture is constitutive of ontology]{.underline}**"
(327). Thus, there needs to be an intertwining and [a correlation
between necropolitics/necroeconomics as a necro-ontology by saying that
politics, economy, society, and culture are mutually constitutive under
the canopy capitalism.]{.underline} And by necroontology is meant

a systematic rendering of particular populations as bodies that must
necessarily be killed \[...\] [necro-ontology can be understood as a
philosophical orientation that rationally organizes populations for
their necessary death.]{.underline} (327)

That is, [necro-ontology frames the current times as an age in which
death and, precisely, extinction are present and caused by the internal
logic of capitalism.]{.underline} Due to its systematic and hegemonic
nature, [necro-ontology generates under its canopy the categories of
necropolitics and necroeconomics]{.underline} which are, at the same
time, mutually constitutive. [These three necro-realities shape the
necroculture in which humankind is immersed, where the non-living is
valued over the living and where life only has value as long as it can
be exploited to meet capitalism's ends]{.underline} (Thorpe 2016).
Although it could be said that this death is part of the natural
selection, in other words Social Darwinism,3 that capitalism has
promoted, these ideas in the shape of a narrative help us go beyond this
realisation. [In a system bound to the war of all against all and the
survival of the fittest that neoliberalism has fostered for decades,
together with the depletion of non-human ecosystems through extractive
practices, the disappearance of human cultures in a globalised world and
the disorientation that the inner human self attains, capitalism is
putting itself at stake through its own logic.]{.underline} Hence,
**[the]{.underline}** capitalist **[logic transmutes these deaths into
processes of becoming extinct,]{.underline}** making the agents in which
capitalism is grounded and dependent insofar as extraction, accumulation
and surplus-value are concerned face their inevitable disappearance.

Therefore, **[these necro-realities are pivotal to come to terms with
the current times and how this narrative helps us move beyond the
geological/ecological/cultural debate]{.underline}** by analysing how
the **[current hegemonic structure has subjugated entities to a
psychological extinction of the human self]{.underline}**. **[These
necro-realities embrace and go beyond external negative biopolitics in
different internal dimensions.]{.underline}** That is, contrary to a
conventional understanding of biopolitics as external force implemented
on a subject, **[neoliberalism exploits and gains its force both from
the external/physical and precisely from the internal human
psyche]{.underline}**.

#### The violence of capital is intensified under necropolitical modes of governance that culminate in extinction

**Batalla, 23** (Invisible Extinction: Fragility and the Extinction of
the Self in Neoliberal Societies, Oriol Batalla a PhD candidate in
Social and Cultural Theory at the Center for the Study of Culture,
Politics, and Society University of Barcelona, Spain, Annali di Ca'
Foscari. Serie orientale Vol. 59 -- Supplement -- December 2023//Jean
Devon Rousseau)

The current neoliberal society embeds the idea of
[necropolitics]{.underline} (Mbembe 2003) at its core, [understood from
a rather]{.underline} [historical materialist lens]{.underline} that
[does not cancel the post-colonial turn in Mbembe]{.underline} but
complements it. [Necropolitics here rejects the idea of necro- as the
politics of having the right to kill]{.underline}. [Instead, it refers
to the right to expose people to death]{.underline} (Mbembe 2003, 12).
For Achilles Mbembe, [necropolitics is "the generalized
instrumentalization of human existence and the material destruction of
human bodies and populations"]{.underline} (14). In other words, in this
process, [humankind becomes subject to the negativity of this dialectic:
death]{.underline}. The human being "becomes a subject -- that is,
separated from the animal -- in the struggle and the work through which
he or she confronts death (understood [as the violence of
negativity]{.underline})" (14), which means upholding death.

Nonetheless, here it is interesting to go beyond Mbembe's ideas[. If one
includes human and non-human beings alike, it regroups the subjects in
the process of becoming extinct.]{.underline} [The exploited human and
non-human agents are to be subjugated under the anvil of
capitalism]{.underline}. Consequently, [human beings who believe they
are entitled to a degree of subjectivity, become a set of objects. They
are objectified, just as non-human ecosystems are.]{.underline}
[Objectified agents lose subjectivity in front of capital and become
victims of necropolitics.]{.underline} **[This death is intrinsically
linked with extinction]{.underline}**, [since death is part of the
process of extinction. Yet this death is unnatural as it is bound to the
external forces of capitalism and it will lead to the disappearance of
whole cultures and ecosystems as it unmakes the task of being and
existing]{.underline}, as opposed to individual deaths that do not
jeopardise the evolutionary process. **[Thus, this death triggers
processes of extinction.]{.underline}**

As a consequence, these politics of exposing entities to death and,
thus, extinction in this paradigm, imply the right to enslave, oppress
and subjugate said entities. Furthermore, as Mbembe pointed out, in our
contemporary world "vast populations are subjected to conditions of life
conferring upon them the status of living-dead" (Mbembe 2003, 40).
Agents living in this system are too dead to be alive yet alive enough
to be exploited.

### !---Climate Change

#### Necro-political violence accelerates climate disasters culminating in extinction 

**Mbembe 2023** (Achille Mbembe is a Cameroonian historian and political
theorist who is a research professor in history and politics at the Wits
Institute for Social and Economy Research at the University of the
Witwatersrand \"Death Itself\| The Politics of Human Extinction.\" Every
Living Thing: The Politics of Life in Common 2023)

As critics of [the term "anthropocene]{.underline}" have argued, [the
rhetorical act of flattening humanity into anthropos---]{.underline}an
invocation of Wynter's Man by another name---[occludes the radically
different relationship that humans have to the climate crisis and
extinction crisis, with regard to both responsibility for those crises
and their impacts in the past, present, and future]{.underline}.85
Nowhere is this difference more keenly felt than in the "cruel irony" of
climate change: [those who live in areas that have contributed the least
to the problem are those who are being impacted first and will suffer
the most]{.underline}, [with Indigenous peoples most acutely at
risk]{.underline}.86 However, [this vulnerability is not just the result
of present-day threats from sea-level rise]{.underline}, Kyle Whyte
argues, [but also an effect of the past: namely, the relocation of many
tribes from expansive lands to small parcels with "limited adaptive
options]{.underline}."87 The [prospect of human extinction allows---I
would hope, demands---humans to identify with each other and with other
forms of life against the threat of death itself and helps us to imagine
how our futures are bound together,]{.underline} a point I will return
to in this book's conclusion. However, as the Wretched of the Earth make
clear, [species thinking also blocks from view other "biological
annihilations" in the past and present and the violence]{.underline},
both agonizingly slow and horrifyingly quick, that has marked, and
continues to mark, some human lives as more "life" than others.

## Alts

### Alt---Refusal

#### The alternative is a refusal of the 1AC. We refuse to recognize that which denies indigenous sovereignty as an act of ontological recalibration to expose the contingency and weakness of sovereign power.

**Thomas 24** (Deborah A. Thomas, R. Jean Brownlee Professor of
Anthropology in the Department of Anthropology at the University of
Pennsylvania; 7-15-24; "Refusal (and Repair)", Annual Review of
Anthropology Volume 53, 2024;
https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-anthro-041422-020201) -- Langham EY

Within both critical Black and Indigenous studies, sovereignty has been
a vexed topic. Having defined itself as universal reason and absolute
perspectivity, [sovereignty is the interior humanity against which all
Others are compared and measured]{.underline} (and found wanting).
[Because **violence is the constitutive force of conquest, colonialism,
and slavery**]{.underline}---[and because within classic formulations of
political philosophy, **control over violence defines and legitimizes
the sovereign**]{.underline}---[**sovereignty is grounded within
historical-ideological** and onto-epistemological **phenomena that
benefit its architects and their progeny, producing whiteness**,
maleness, and Europeanness **as the apex of humanity**, the epitome of
transparency, universality, determination, and causality]{.underline}
(Ferreira da Silva 2007, Kauanui 2008, Sturm 2002, Wynter 2003).
[**Sovereignty operates by solidifying boundaries, controlling movement,
demanding a singularity of life** out of a vast multiplicity, and
creating and then **naturalizing hierarchies that function through
dehumanization, dispossession, and exclusion.** These **processes
advance through** the ongoing and simultaneous **recognition and
elimination of Indigenous populations**]{.underline} (Morgensen 2011,
Wolfe 2006), [through the **constitution of Black people as dispossessed
and** therefore **depoliticized subjects**]{.underline} (Spillers 1987),
[and through the standardization of dominant settler reckonings of
time]{.underline} (Bruyneel 2007, Rifkin 2017) [and relationship to
place]{.underline} (Harris 1993). How then can one enact
self-determination when new forms of dispossession are continuously
rewritten over earlier removals and displacements, what Shanya Cordis
(2019) would call the "settler ascription of sovereign in/capacity" (p.
20)?

It is important to remember that **[sovereignty is]{.underline}**, as
Joanne Barker (2005) has argued, "**[historically
contingent]{.underline}**. . .[**embedded within** the specific
**social** **relations** in which it is invoked and given
meaning]{.underline}" (p. 21). [Thus, it is **not unitary** but
instead]{.underline} "**[messy and incomplete]{.underline}**," as Circe
Sturm (2017, p. 343) has argued; relatedly, sovereignty has been
described as interdependent (Cattelino 2008, 2023), nested (Simpson
2014), and entangled (Dennison 2012). It is also important to remember
that [**sovereignty is obsessed with security because its conquest** and
disavowal of interiority **are never seamless** nor complete; it can be,
and often is]{.underline}, "[unhinged]{.underline}" (Thomas & Masco
2023), [**always potentially undone by that which fails to recognize
it**, by **that which refuses it** in intentional and unconscious ways.
Critical scholars within Black studies and Indigenous studies have
encouraged us to look at the question of sovereignty beyond the state
and beyond the parameters of its institutions, positioning it instead as
practices, performances, and processes that refuse law and dominion and
that draw attention to alternative ontological modes of governance,
community, and ceremony.]{.underline} In this way,
[they]{.underline}---like those in the previous section---[challenge
Western parameters of Being and becoming]{.underline} (see also Biehl &
Locke 2017).

Building from her classic articulation of refusal in Mohawk Interruptus,
[Audra Simpson]{.underline} (2014), for example, [has attempted to
distinguish sovereignty as a Western form of exceptionalism and
dominance from "**sovereignty as Indigenous belonging, dignity, and
justice**"]{.underline} (Simpson 2020, p. 686). In the latter context,
[the language of sovereignty has been central to Indigenous claims for
self-governance whether these claims are being presented to other
Indigenous nations, to other governments]{.underline} (such as the
United States or Canada), or to international tribunals. [Sovereignty
matters]{.underline}, therefore, [because it is a way to talk about an
ontology that makes land and water central to personhood, safety, and
integrity. In this **ontological recalibration**]{.underline}, Simpson
argues, [where easy spatial and temporal binaries and **Western
hierarchies** of being are **refused, sovereignty becomes a form of
relationality rather than an instrument of exclusion and violence**, a
logic for reproducing colonial rule through the perpetuation of the
tropes of cultural and temporal difference.]{.underline}

Similarly, Nishnaabeg scholar and writer Leanne Simpson (2017) discusses
[Indigenous governing structures as processual and emergent, a system of
leadership that reflected the local landscape. The idea of nationhood
that emerges from this relationality of context, land, and people
reflects what she calls an "ecology of intimacy"]{.underline} (p. 8),
[one grounded in connection, relationship, reciprocity, respect, and
self-determination]{.underline} (see also Maynard & Simpson 2022). For
Leanne Simpson, and for others, [**sovereignty cannot be rooted in
recognition** by the political formation **of the nation-state** because
it is inherent and unceded]{.underline} (Moreton-Robinson 2007).
Instead, [**sovereignty emerges from** the kind of]{.underline}
"**[grounded normativity]{.underline}**" [that]{.underline} Glen
Coulthard (2014) has argued [**grows through resurgent political** and
cultural **practices.** These are]{.underline} what Laura Harjo (2019)
identifies as "[practices of futurity]{.underline}" (p. 13)---[everyday
**community-based practices through which people recognize their own
power** to act and to self-determine]{.underline}---[practices that
**bring** a]{.underline} "**[radical sovereignty]{.underline}**" **[into
being.]{.underline}** Conscious efforts toward language revitalization
are among the ways to elaborate this kind of sovereignty, one that can
also redound to new forms of economic autonomy (Davis 2018; see also
Cattelino 2008). But so, too, are the kinds of rejections Larry Nesper
(2002) addresses in his account of Ojibwe spearfishers in Wisconsin who
"violated" fishing regulations in their observation of off-reservation
rights that had been guaranteed by nineteenth-century treaties with the
federal government. Other Native North American struggles for dignity,
land, water, and self-preservation---**[refusals of the state's refusal
of Native sovereignty]{.underline}**---[have similarly been
criminalized]{.underline} (Barker 2021), [yet tribes continue to
**challenge** juridical **norms that perpetuate human/nonhuman divides**
through the language of ownership]{.underline} (e.g., Carroll 2015,
Estes 2019, Powell 2018, Todd 2018).

### Alt---Bio-Plurality

#### We endorse bio-plurality as a response to western man colonial/racial modes of violence

**Mbembe 2023** (Achille Mbembe is a Cameroonian historian and political
theorist who is a research professor in history and politics at the Wits
Institute for Social and Economy Research at the University of the
Witwatersrand \"Death Itself\| The Politics of Human Extinction.\" Every
Living Thing: The Politics of Life in Common 2023//Jean Devon Rousseau)

**[For those of us not taught to see the other-than-human world as
kin,]{.underline}** it may be difficult to understand the complex moral
bonds and mutual responsibility that are reflected in the Gwitchin
statement. [But if meaningful political action is to be taken at this
critical moment, a different way of thinking is essential.]{.underline}
[Species thinking is a useful tool to imagine how human and
other-than-human lives, deaths, and futures are intertwined, and it
serves an important rhetorical role]{.underline} with regard to
scholarship, advocacy, and policy. But species works like any
terministic screen. [By focusing tightly on similarity, species thinking
occludes the differences by which we may identify the working of power:
the fulcrum of both resistance and justice]{.underline}. In contrast,
this chapter has offered [the idea of bioplurality, a way of thinking
with, within, and beyond species, toggling back and forth between
individual and kind, similarity and difference, connections and
distinctions, noting resonances while also listening carefully for
moments of dissonance]{.underline}. By highlighting similarity,
bioplurality avoids the twin traps of humanist and antihumanist
exceptionalism that assume that humans are outside the living world or
that we are somehow exempt from threats to it. [By attending to
difference, bioplurality marks humanity's unique culpability for the
current crises but also its unequal responsibility for those crises and
their unequal effects]{.underline}.

### Alt---Ontological Disobedience

#### The alternative is an act of ontological disobedience against the 1AC to disrupt the (neo)colonial episteme -- We give voice to the haunting presence of the subaltern that undergirds the onto-epistemological assumptions of the 1AC. 

**Andruecci & Zogfratos 22** (Diego Andreucci, PhD candidate of the
Institute for Environmental Science and Technology at the Autonomous
University of Barceloma; Christos Zogfrafos, Associate Professor at the
Department of Political and Social Sciences of Universitat Pompeu Fabra;
11-22; "Between improvement and sacrifice: Othering and the
(bio)political ecology of climate change";
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102512) -- Langham EY

[Central to the goal of **challenging** the **neocolonial** and
neoliberal **government** of climate change is to both **deconstruct
hierarchizing discourses of the other that underwrite its domination,
and to reassert the ability of the subaltern to "speak".** This entails
recognising and **respecting epistemic** and material **difference**
beyond and against the dominant operations of othering.]{.underline} A
Foucauldian perspective helps us to see that [**dominant discourses**
become dominant precisely by **silencing, disqualifying or subjugating
other knowledges** and ways of understanding and enacting
socio-ecological relations]{.underline} (Sullivan, 2019, p. 18). [While
these "truth-effects" can become relatively stable, such stability is
always contingent and provisional. The **discursive "closure"** they
seek to achieve **is never complete: subjugated knowledges continue to
"haunt" and destabilise dominant discourses.**]{.underline}

In our article, we have focused on literatures that critically unpack
dominant constructions of the "other" in relation to climate-related
areas of intervention. But there is also growing emphasis, in political
ecology and geography, on reasserting and rendering visible alternative
"ontologies" and practices, as ways of resisting othering and of
"worlding" differently (Burman, 2017; DePuy et al., 2021; Radcliffe &
Radhuber, 2020; Sullivan, 2017). According to Burman (2017, pp. 932;
934), for instance, [**critiquing the epistemic violence of
(neo)colonial knowledge** systems entails attending to the practices of
"**ontological disobedience**" of the subaltern: recuperating the
"censored lifeworlds that have for centuries coexisted, and sometimes
merged in creative constellations, with hegemonic notions of the nature
of reality"---and which may contain "a systematic critique of
fossil-fuelled capitalism and the coloniality of reality".]{.underline}
Similarly, for Sullivan (2017), [critically unpacking dominant ways of
framing solutions to the ongoing ecological and climate crisis---the
instrumental, calculative and techno-managerial rationalities and
monetised accounting practices of the neoliberal "green
economy"]{.underline} (see also Dunlap & Sullivan, 2020)---both
necessitates and opens up space for attending to different ways of
knowing and being in the world.

While fully engaging with these conversations is beyond the scope of
this article, [we support the argument that overcoming the "coloniality"
of development, by **reasserting the "pluriversality" of "non-Western"
socio-environmental knowledges** and praxes]{.underline} (Demaria &
Kothari, 2017), **[is necessary to build climate
justice]{.underline}**---something that proponents of a Green New Deal
and similar frameworks must take seriously. We must be mindful, however,
that there is more to decolonization than discursive emancipation
(Anthias & Hoffmann, 2021; Rivera Cusicanqui, 2012). As Burman (2017, p.
935) argues, by itself, "an apolitical rumination of ontological
multiplicity offers quite meagre prospects for critically addressing
social and climate injustice". Rather, he adds, [the concerns of
political ontology must go hand in hand with those of political ecology;
that is, with the critique of material power asymmetries and global
unequal (ecological) relations. Decolonizing entails]{.underline} also,
and perhaps primarily, [giving back the land to indigenous
communities]{.underline} (Tuck & Yang, 2012) [and reasserting the
sovereignty of formerly colonized peoples, including access to and
control over natural resources and other means of production and
reproduction---as part of broader struggles attacking the material as
well as ideological bases of capitalist class hegemony and
imperialism.]{.underline}

### Alt---The Party of the Dead

#### The alternative is to affirm the [party of the dead]{.underline} -- The very impossibility of an organizational praxis of the dead emphasizes death as both the insensible and inevitable limit of experience to challenge the social order's desire to transgress death through immortality. The party produces a reciprocal Necropolitics against the sovereign through the performative desecration of its miraculous power.

**Ogula 25** (Vladimir Ogula, PhD candidate at the Doctoral School of
Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations at Central
European University, Vienna; 4-21-25; "Necropolitics and Necropolice:
Death, Immortality, and Art-Activism in Russia", *International
Political Sociology*, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2025, olaf006; DOI:
https://doi.org/10.1093/ips/olaf006) -- Langham EY

So far, I have shown that in its protests and performances ["**the party
of the dead**" **foregrounds death as the finitude of being and the dead
as a political subject that is impossible** precisely **because there is
no "after" death in which their existence could be grounded. Pursuing**
that **impossibility** regardless, "**the party**" **produces the
experience of the limit**, the experience of insensibility.
This]{.underline} kind of failure [speaks to multiple studies of
failure's productive and **disruptive power in relation to social
norms**]{.underline}, often invoked in performance studies and queer
studies. However, it is irreducible to playful disobedience to the norms
establishing both the value and the meaning of "success," which
constitutes a significant part of the work of theorists such as Jack
Halberstam (2011) and Jose Muñoz (2009). "Queer failure" is the failure
to conform to social norms; it "rejects normative ideas of value" (Muñoz
2009, 173). Its subject is "unintelligible" and "does not fit neatly
into the normative framework through which it is intended to be
understood" (Charrett 2020, 139).

While "the party of the dead" similarly articulates the subject that is
unrecognizable by the regime of necropolice, the kind of failure they
pursue is more profound. [The "party's" failure to speak as the dead in
the attempt to do this is]{.underline} what Brian Massumi (2014, 7)
calls [an "**effective paradox**"---the coming together of two different
logics in a single act. **The play of the dead brings together the world
where there are no limits**, anything can happen, and so nothing is
surprising, even the speaking corpse, **and the world where death
constitutes the limit, and therefore a** **possibility of the
impossible.**]{.underline} Bringing these two logics together---one at
the level of content and another at the level of style---["**the
party**" exp**resses both the speech of the dead and its negation. It is
a double failure to bring into being the unrecognizable subject, and
hence the performance of the dead as an unintelligible and impossible
subject, a troubling nonbeing.** This double failure succeeds in showing
death as the limit of being, knowledge, and sensibility. It is the
expression of this limit and the experience of it, **the performance of
impossibility** rather than a possibility of another, yet unrecognized
kind of speech, that **constitutes the core of necropolitics** under and
against the necropolice.]{.underline}

Georges Bataille, whose thought informs Mbembe's (2003)
conceptualization of necropower, offers a nuanced concept of sovereignty
intertwined with death but detached from statehood that helps further
understand the politics of "the party's" failure. While no doubt
connected with [the capacity to kill]{.underline} ([an act that,
sovereignty being a transgression of limits, a violation of a taboo,
cannot be reduced and is even opposed to a right to kill]{.underline};
Bataille 1991, 220--2) and with the life beyond needs (Bataille 1991,
198), Bataille's "sovereignty" is first and foremost grounded in the
concept of "miraculous." He summarizes the meaning of the concept in a
concise phrase, which simultaneously clarifies it and confers conceptual
weight upon the word ["miracle": "impossible and yet there it
is"]{.underline} (Bataille 1991, 206). [It is through a peculiar
temporality that **a miracle is the moment of sovereignty.** As "the
moment when anticipation dissolves into NOTHING"]{.underline} (Bataille
1991, 207), [when time collapses, the miraculous occurrence brings
about, however temporarily, the world of no needs. If an object becomes
useful only in having a relation to a future end, it is the cut of that
relation, the cut that suspends the vision of what is to come, that
brings about sovereignty.]{.underline}

[Impossible yet real, a miracle need not be a positive one: the miracle
of a person's survival despite certain death is as unexpected and
impossible yet real as the unanticipated, sudden death is.]{.underline}
Hence, Bataille writes of **[death as "the negative analogue of
miracle"]{.underline}** (Bataille 1991, 207). [**Sovereignty** is
strangely dubious]{.underline}---[it **is found both in the
contemplation of a rising sun** and in the sorrow over the deceased,
both in the time of blissful forgetfulness and in the traumatic
shrinking of duration to a single moment]{.underline} (Bataille 1991,
199--200). [The precise emotional circumstances of the event matter
little]{.underline}---[instead]{.underline}, "[what matters most from
this point of view is that an unanticipated, unhoped-for aspect,
considered impossible, reveals itself]{.underline}" (Bataille 1991,
210). The question of limits that sovereignty transgresses opens up in a
different light when we consider these lines. Whereas Mbembe (as well as
Agamben (1998, 112--3) in his reading of Bataille) reduces a limit to a
taboo, for Bataille prohibition is only a specific case of social limits
dividing the world into that of utility (or practice) and its outside.
More broadly, **[sovereignty consists in the transgression of limits
separating our understanding of possible and
impossible]{.underline}**---the limits that Rancière's police draws and
politics suspends.

Toward the end of *The Schema of Sovereignty*, Bataille (1991, 222--3)
offers the final reflections on the connection between sovereignty and
death by examining the event of **[the sovereign's death]{.underline}**.
Here sovereignty [is no longer connected with an exercise of power and
rather **becomes the deathly dissolution of authority**]{.underline},
including that of the sovereign. [An immortal being that transgresses
death even in dying]{.underline}---through its connection with the
divine or the people---[the **sovereign falls prey to death in the
moment of himself being subjected to the practices that he
instrumentalized and appropriated for himself.** **What a revolution
does is bring death back into the social order by revealing the
mortality of the king**]{.underline}---**[through both the physical act
of destroying the king's body and the destruction of the divine source
of authority.]{.underline}** However, [that act is at the same
time]{.underline} "[the greatest affirmation of
sovereignty]{.underline}" (Bataille 1991, 223) [because in a world where
death is no longer a limit, it is the limit of immortality,]{.underline}
"[the limit of the Limitless]{.underline}" (Foucault 1998a, 71) [that
sovereignty transgresses. **The death of the king becomes a miraculous
event.** It is in the disappearance of a sovereign where sovereignty is
found.]{.underline}

Reading Bataille together with Rancière, the question of the
relationship between politics and death opens up anew. Truly, as Mbembe
writes, for Bataille, [sovereignty consists in the transgression of
limits. However, the world without limits, where none exist, is not a
positive order. It can only appear as a non-world, that is, as nothing,
absence, the void, or the outside. Hence, sovereignty, as the
transgression of limits, is the moment when nothing is enacted. Yet
simultaneously here power is suspended, and the new order]{.underline},
"[the police]{.underline}" [with its rules distributing political
participation, is yet to be formed. Sovereignty appears at the end of
the sovereign.]{.underline} It is in this sense that Bataille's concept
of sovereignty resonates with Rancière's notion of politics---both point
toward a situated, momentary clash between the two worlds: one where
everyone is assigned a part and there is no outside and another where
the outside makes itself visible as the outside. **[If necropolice is
based on the negation of death, of nothingness, on the illusion of
immortality, then necropolitics, in an affirmative sense, as the
politics of death and the dead rather than killing, is "an affirmation
that affirms nothing"]{.underline}** (Foucault 1998a, emphasis mine).
[**It brings death back into the sensible as death**---**as an event
that**, no matter how painful, sorrowful, or impossible it may be, **is
still real.**]{.underline}

[Translators between the realm outside the limit of experience and the
realm where there's nothing left to experience, not even dying, "the
party of the dead" utter the simplest and yet the most impossible truth
with the words "THE DEAD DON'T NEED WAR." Their speech dissipates the
moment it emerges, situated in the coincidence between death as the
realm of no needs and of the need to make that needlessness sensible,
between the dead as absent beings and the necessity of their silence to
be audible for life to have value. By speaking as the dead and failing
to speak as the truly dead, "the party" affirms the possibility of
finitude, after which there is no speech, there is nothing, there is no
"after." **In a world where death has been erased and so is
omnipresent**, where no end is in sight and hence apocalypse is imminent
and that's ok, where history is over and so things will get worse and
worse, **true death is akin to a miracle, however painful unendurable it
is. Its articulation, an operation of affirmative necropolitics, turns
out to be a powerful political statement valuing life and making space
for hope**]{.underline}---[as **a possibility of the future as such
rather than a belief in a concrete project. The dead might not need
this. But perhaps the living do.**]{.underline}

Conclusion

In this article, I have shown how **[death and the dead can be mobilized
as critical aesthetic resources to challenge the social order built on
the desire to transgress mortality.]{.underline}** This order, which I
call necropolice, is as much macro-political as it is micro-political.
On the micro-political level, it excludes death from the distribution of
the sensible as the limit of sensibility. Necropolice is the regime of
hopelessness and despair. On the macro-political level, the result of
this exclusion is the everyday production of objectified, invisible
corpses---necropolitics in Mbembe's (2003) original conceptualization.

**[The ideal politics challenging such a regime would be articulating
the impossible by the impossible subject---the return of death by the
dead. "The party of the dead" takes up the task of making such an
impossible politics palpable.]{.underline}** Their rituals and protests,
besides exposing the reliance of Putin's Russia on the production of
dead bodies, are examples of struggling with performing the dead while
realizing the incompleteness of such a performance---and further turning
that incompleteness into a critical aesthetic technique of expressing
death as the limit of experience. Through the non-identarian and macabre
visual style, the use of parodic, satiric, and self-reflexively
disavowing language, and rituals reenacting a burial, the "party"
weakens the boundary between the living and the dead, instead
articulating their continuity and belonging to the same community of
mortals, juxtaposed to the necropolice's immortal subject. [**Trying to
speak as the dead and failing to speak as truly dead, "the party"
produces the experience of death as the limit of experience, the moment
that one cannot truly experience and yet is still real.** It does not
make the insensible sensible, that is, incorporate it into the everyday
regime of visibility as another positive category, but produces "the
insensible" as the outside of that regime within it, as a non-world, the
end of the world, that is only experienced in the failure to experience
it]{.underline}. It is the production of such an experience that, in the
order of necropolice constitutes the essence of necropolitics as a
politics of death and the dead.

While situated in the context of late Putin's Russia and indebted to the
local art movements such as late Soviet necrorealism, "the party of the
dead" positions itself as having no borders and welcomes anyone to join
it if they agree with the basic principles of freedom, equality, and
mortality. By doing so, they remind us that the logic of necropolice is
not exclusive to any particular state. Negation of death is a more
general principle upon which state sovereignty is built---and it is in
the suspense of that principle where another kind of sovereignty is
found.

[Michelle laments that critiques of international law focus too much on
'unmasking' the problem, rather than 'raising the possibility of any
alternative legal order or alternative form of international
law']{.underline} (Kelsall, at 755). As she puts it: '\[i\]n keeping
with a tradition of critical legal studies, the primary goal of critique
remains to expose what is wrong or lacking in the current legal order
rather than to suggest viable alternatives' (Kelsall, at 735). But can
viable alternatives be suggested if our categories of thought and
practice -- our languages and schemes of representations -- are products
of the legal order that one is aiming to disorder, transform or abolish?
[Are 'unmasking']{.underline} (or debunking) [and
'exposing']{.underline} (or revealing) [not the best tools available to
confront the enclosure of thought and contest the order of values that
are taken as given in the world of modernity and its legal
order?]{.underline} These questions relate to broader debates on
different modes of critique (or post-critique) broadly understood as
affirmative (which 'move from critique to an affirmative account of
ethical ways of being and becoming in the world beyond modernity', to
'find alternative ways to live after the world, to creatively and
improvisationally engage with this world from these outside
perspectives', as Chipato and Chandler put it (at 8)) and negative
critique (the task of which is that of negation, rather than
affirmation: to deconstruct and refuse the world of modernity 'before we
can start thinking about something better', ibid (at 14)).

**[Affirmative critiques overcome dialectics of contradiction by
imagining what comes after opposition,]{.underline}** while negative
critiques stop short at determining what the problem is, without
necessarily offering a way beyond it. While **[affirmative
critiques]{.underline}** -- or post-critiques more generally -- and
their turns to aesthetics, affects, corporeal embodiment, and care have
been criticized for being depoliticizing (even apolitical and
ahistorical), negative critiques have been contested for their focus on
deconstruction, their cynicism and alienation, their inhibition of
constructive alliances. For Rosi Braidotti indeed, who elaborated the
'affirmative turn', the latter 'is clinical in the sense that it is
"detoxifying us from the effects of the negative," and creative rather
than descriptive, as it [**must not stop at the actual**, which would be
a critique of what we are ceasing to be, **but move onto**]{.underline}
"[**creative actualization of the virtua**l]{.underline} ([i.e. **of
what we are in the process of becoming**]{.underline})"' (as Gandorfer
puts it (at 372), in reference to Braidotti (at 7)). In this spirit,
[affirmative critiques come close to **pre-figurative politics** and
legalities]{.underline} (Cooper, 2023; Cohen & Morgan, 2023).

Today, however, in seeking radical alternatives to the modernist
world-ordering project and its colonial, racial, and ecological
oppressive foundations, we witness a renewed backlash against such
approaches, with a growing number of perspectives grounded in Black
studies, Black feminist theory and decolonial works that argue for
'world-destructive theories' (which are 'world-subtractive rather than
world-additive') (Colebrook, 2021; Colebrook, 2023; Ramírez- D'Oleo,
2023), the 'negativation' of refusal (Ferreira da Silva, 2022), the
'paraontological' (Chandler, 2013; Karera, 2022; Chandler, Pugh &
Dekeyser, 2023), the 'abyss' (Pugh & Chandler, 2023), the 'Black
horizon' (Chipato & Chandler, 2022; Chipato & Chandler, 2025),
'worldlessness' (Dekeyser, 2022), 'nothingness' (Moten, 2013), the 'non-
relational' (Chipato & Chandler, 2022; Terada, 2023), 'Afropessimism'
(Wilderson III, 2020), 'non-philosophy' or 'antiphilosophy' (Ferguson,
2020); or the 'antipolitical' (Danewid, 2023). These contemporary
strands of critique can broadly be conceived as enactments of refusal.
As articulated by the Practicing Refusal Collective founded by Tina
Campt and Saidiya Hartman, [**refusal is a 'generative and capacious
rubric for theorizing everyday practices of struggle** often obscured by
an emphasis on collective acts of resistance'. Practicing
refusal]{.underline}, then, [names 'the urgency of rethinking the time,
space, and fundamental vocabulary of what constitutes politics,
activism, and theory, as well as what it means to refuse the terms given
to us to name these struggles']{.underline} (ibid.). As Tina Campt
understands it, [**refusal is nothing less than 'a rejection of the
status quo as livable and the creation of possibility in the face of
negation, i.e. a refusal to recognize a system that renders you
fundamentally illegible** and unintelligible; **the decision to reject
the terms of diminished subjecthood with which one is presented, using
negation as a generative and creative source of disorderly power to
embrace the possibility of living otherwise**']{.underline} (ibid.).

[If practices of refusal use 'negation as a generative and creative
source of disorderly power to embrace the possibility of living
otherwise', then **refusal** **seems to overcome the binary between
either negative or affirmative critique**]{.underline} -- thereby
echoing another invitation that Michelle formulates in her article,
namely [to 'reject\[-\] the idea of an either/or binary' in favour of 'a
logic of non-dualism']{.underline} (Kelsall, at 731). Indeed, as a mode
and practice of critique, [refusal seems to combine both elements of
negative and affirmative approaches, yet distinctively so: **the
generative nature of negation is here speculative.** Gestures of
refusal]{.underline} -- **[a refusal of recognition and inclusion into
the world of modernity and its template of liberal
subjectivity]{.underline}** -- **[cling to the necessity of imagining
'otherwise worlds']{.underline}** (Lethabo King et al, 2020). To take
the example of Saidiya Hartman, for whom the refusal of the anti-Black
order, dominant narratives and structures of power is imperative, [this
refusal is not merely a negative act, but a generative one
too.]{.underline} In Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments, Hartman
reckons indeed how the young black women she critically fabulates into
existence, waywardly, 'were radical thinkers who tirelessly imagined
other ways to live and never failed to consider how the world must be
otherwise' (Hartman, 2019, at xv). In a similar vein, in Unpayable Debt,
Denise Ferreira da Silva argues that the task of 'negativation' --
whereby [the negative is activated to perform an enactment of refusal:
'**refusal to die, refusal to comply, refusal to give up and give
in**']{.underline} (Ferreira da Silva, at 273) -- [**is to** 'expose,
describe, and **unsettle** \[the\] arrangement \[of post-Enlightenment
thinking and political architecture and of **modern
existence**\]']{.underline} (Ferreira da Silva, at 36). Ferreira da
Silva here clearly embeds her work into a form of negative critique and
dis-ordering process. Yet [the task of negativation]{.underline},
Ferreira da Silva continues, [is also to 'articulate an invitation to an
image of existence that is not supported by force of necessity or the
mechanisms of symbolic and total violence it sustains']{.underline}
(Ferreira da Silva, at 37). Such enactments of refusal of the order of
things, which are driven by an imagining of how things could be
otherwise, is perhaps best articulated in Ferreira da Silva's call for
'\[c\]reative poethical tools that welcome other images of existence
while the work of bringing about the end of the world we know is under
way' (Ferreira da Silva, at 286). [Refusal transpires here as a mode of
critique or a method of 're/de/compos\[ing\] the continuing and lively
inheritances of Enlightenment thought, moving us toward the potential
dissolution of its forms']{.underline} (Ekbo & Ferreira da Silva, 2023;
Ferreira da Silva, at 28). ['This is the domain of
speculation']{.underline}, Ferreira da Silva insists, which is 'about
thinking guided by an "as if," as if the image captures existence'.
[This speculation, however, is neither about 'proving that something is
true', nor about finding 'a principle from which to only determine,
delimit, consider something']{.underline} (ibid). It is here that I see
an important difference with more traditional modes of affirmative
critique. [By **joining** concrete and actual practices of **refusal**
of the world as given, **with speculative imaginings** of a world
otherwise, **a distinctive mode of critique emerges**, which hints to a
different way of existing in this world in relation to
others.]{.underline} Because, as Fred Moten claims, ['I believe in the
world and want to be in it. I want to be in it all the way to the end of
it because I believe in another world in the world and I want to be in
that']{.underline} (Harney and Moten, 2013, at 118).

Coming back to Michelle's article, a sense of refusal echoes in the
principle of 'non-consent' she invokes to illustrate practices of
disordering, exemplified in her piece through concrete actions of
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament (Kelsall, at 756). An imagined
otherwise world without nuclear proliferation -- which does not
'threaten\[-\] human existence as a whole' -- is imagined here without,
however, being pre-determined or given in advance. For Michelle, such
examples of ['non-consent' may enable critics of international law 'to
start to think through how this might affect our understanding of the
norms, principles and conventions that should be given priority in
international law']{.underline} (Kelsall, at 756). Yet, as I elaborate
in the concluding remarks, there might be more to gain from engaging
with practices of refusal in 'disordering' international law.

Concluding Thoughts

The generative and creative connection between refusing and imagining
brings me back to my initial observation about 'dis' and 're'-ordering
international law. Michelle's argument calls for both negative and
affirmative modes of critiquing international law -- for both 'dis' and
're'-ordering the international legal order. Indeed, ['**international
legal disordering**']{.underline}, Michelle argues, 'moves the goal of
critique beyond challenging convention, towards changing it' and does so
by 're- imagining' and 're-constituting' the international order anew
(Kelsall, at 729). Michelle conceives this re-imagining exercise as 'the
painstaking and messy work of recognizing the knowledge systems and
understandings of law that today comprise our world and the
inter-sovereign' (Kelsall, at 756). Yet, are we hereby not re-entering
the liberal realm of recognition, inclusion, and expansion? Put
differently, [urging 'to reconstitute norms, conventions and principles
determined with reference to a multiplicity of spatial orders existing
over time, including the orders of communities whose knowledge has thus
far remained largely outside international law']{.underline} (Kelsall,
at 755), [assumes a desire or demand to be included into a 'unified'
inter-national and inter-sovereign order]{.underline} (Kelsall, at 756).
[This assumption discards potential politics of refusal against an
inclusive recognition]{.underline} (Simpson, 2014) [that acts as
pre-condition to be made transparent to]{.underline} (Glissant, 1997)
[and admitted into existence in the international legal
order.]{.underline} In a similar vein, when holding that '\[t\]he task
here would not stop at critique, in that the norms, conventions,
principles and practices would need to be documented and brought into
some form of as yet disordered order, a morass of worlds colliding'
(Kelsall, at 756), Michelle articulates a reformist promise of
re-ordering that should mobilize critics to have faith and get involved
in dis-ordering international law. 'While initially being a disordered
worldview', Michelle argues, 'it is one that international lawyers
should confront', since a 'disordered worldview' may 'open up the
possibilities for international law to govern a unified world, or
worlds' (ibid.).

And yet, [as practices of refusal suggest, perhaps it is precisely
**this tendency towards re-ordering**, re-inscription and re-
unification that **might need to be suspended.** The nuance lies in
where the action is oriented and power distributed, namely towards dis-
rather than re-ordering the world of modernity and its conditions of
existence]{.underline}. It might be hidden in this interstice between
the 'dis-' and the 're-' that Michelle re-commits herself to a liberal
vocabulary and worldview, where the disordering ultimately serves to
guide and inform processes of reordering -- of recognition, of
inclusion, of documentation, of unification (Kelsall, at 755-756). [**To
link disordering with refusal**, rather than reordering, **might open up
an image of existence** '**after the end of the world**']{.underline}
(Ferreira da Silva, 2022; Colebrook, 2023; Jackson, 2020; Yusoff, 2018),
[where the end of the world and of its liberal international legal order
is figurative or speculative: it 'neither presumes nor demands data,
meaning, evidence, or ground' -- as long as the work of disordering is
under way]{.underline} (Ferreira da Silva, 2022, at 286). In this
spirit, Michelle's remarkable article might well be an invitation [to
're/de/compose' international law.]{.underline}

Sovereignty in the Arctic, and the Arctic Council

The formation of the Arctic Council 3 was necessitated by the
international laws governing territoriality of the Arctic Circle,
particularly the Arctic Ocean as international waters, and by the
increasing necessity of protecting the precarious environment of the
Arctic and to sustainably develop the region on the brink of the 21st
century. (Bloom 1999) Its objectives were then clarified with the Ottawa
Declaration, recognising the role indigenous peoples of the Arctic play
within the region and its sustainable development and granting a
Permanent Participant status to the Sámi, the Inuit, and the Russian
circumpolar indigenous peoples, [opening new avenues of **dialogue
between** the **nation-states** and the **indigenous peoples**.
Historically, these dialogues have **proven**
**difficult**.]{.underline} (ibid.)

[What **started** as a]{.underline} largely [**collaborative** effort
attempting]{.underline} to sustain a precarious region's environment
amid increasing changes in the climate [soon **became** a **vehicle of
conflict** due to the]{.underline} "\...[**changing conceptualizations**
**of** their **northern frontiers** and consider\[ations of\]
**expanding economic activities** there]{.underline}..." (Gerhardt et
al. 2010) Historically, an idealised binary version of sovereignty
defined the difference between land and water as a difference of
controllable and unboundable, and therefore resistant to
territorialisation. (Steinberg 2009) - however, [the material realities
of the new resource-extraction frontiers within the Arctic waters
necessitate variations of sovereignty that account for permafrost and
semi-permafrost areas, animal behaviours, seasonal land-falls and
land-fast ice and other aspects of the **ever-changing** environment of
the **Arctic**.]{.underline} (Gerhardt et al. 2010) [Dynamically, the
**Arctic does not conform** **to** an **idealised** form of
**fixed-in-space sovereignty** **nation-states** **can exercise**
clearly.]{.underline} (Shadian 2010) [Instead, a form of **sovereignty**
somewhere on the edge **between** **performance** and **capital interest
materialises** - all **nation-states within the Arctic** have a set of
attitudes and **investments** **towards** the **terra** **communis** of
the Arctic they attempt to **weaponize** **in pursuit** of **resource
extraction** and **influence expansion**.]{.underline} "[As the
**Arctic** is always **framed** **as** a **frontier of resource
opportunity**, the **establishment of sovereignty** has never been about
extending the social contract to Arctic peoples, rather it has always
been **about** achieving **access to** the **economic incentives**
inherent within the region.]{.underline}" (Wood-Donnelly 2018)

[The Arctic Council has **no binding treaties** **on resource
extraction** within the region, and is rather by legal nature an
"intergovernmental forum"]{.underline} (Loukacheva 2020) As for its
contributions to international law governing the region, the Arctic
Council has played a significant role in coordinating three legally
binding agreements amongst its member States - the the Agreement on
Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic
(2011); the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution
Preparedness and Response in the Arctic (2013); and the Agreement on
Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017). (ibid.) As
per its mandate, the Arctic Council's nature is protecting the Arctic
environment, streamlining cooperation between States party and
addressing common points of concern - [**resource extraction
regulation** is completely **off** **the cards** as every member State
has its own particular interest within the region and common ground is
difficult to find within the matter.]{.underline} (Hanaček 2022) [This
make-up of the organisation leaves the **States** almost completely
**responsible for** the **regulation of** their **indigenous**
**population** and expansion of their resource extraction, **without**
much outside **oversight**.]{.underline} The international governance
essential to the conflicts between the nation-state and the indigenous
over resource frontiers stems from universal human rights and further
international treaties on the rights of the indigenous peoples.

The single most significant of these treaties is the International
Labour Organisation's Convention 169 on the Indigenous and Tribal
Peoples, ratified and thus binding by 22 states worldwide, including
Arctic regional players of Denmark and Norway. Largely considered the
most in-depth legally binding instrument of protecting indigenous
minorities, (Larsen & Gilbert, 2020) some of the most important
takeaways from ILOC169 are the "\...right to decide their own priorities
for the process of development as it affects their lives, beliefs,
institutions and spiritual well-being and the lands they occupy or
otherwise use, and to exercise control, to the extent possible, over
their own economic, social and cultural development. 4", due regard to
indigenous customs and customary laws 5 , the right of nomadic and
cultivating peoples to use their traditionally used lands 6 and
prohibition of non-consensual relocation. 7

Even with the impressive body of work within the ILOC169, its
[application]{.underline} over the last thirty years [is a tale of
**failures** and **broken agreements**]{.underline}, especially
concerning the Sámi. Both [assimilation and **resource-extraction**
policies of national governments that concern the indigenous culture and
the indigenous lands are prone to **violating**]{.underline} the
**[provisions]{.underline}** of ILOC169, and their implementations not
only shapes the Sámi suffering of today, but implicitly
[echoes]{.underline} the [colonial policies]{.underline} spotlighted
within the first chapter.

of the Arctic"; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-11120-4_12) --
Langham EY

Thinking about the biopolitics of care is also fundamental to the work
of two other scholars of the Arctic---Marjo Lindroth and Heidi
SinevaaraNiskanen---whose work addresses it as a central theme (Lindroth
& Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2018, 2022). The focus of their research has been
on the continuities of colonialism at work in the policies of Arctic
states such as Canada, as well as the Arctic Council. This is important
because the Arctic Council is often identified as a more progressive and
postcolonial regime of governance when compared with the Arctic states.
As Lindroth and Sinevaara-Niskanen describe, the significance of the
Arctic Council is that it functions to represent a structural
transformation in the relations of states to indigenous peoples, on
account of its being more inclusive and consultative of indigenous
peoples than the states of the Arctic region (Lindroth &
Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022: 16). Whether we are considering the care of
the Arctic Council or of Arctic states for indigenous peoples, [it is
essential]{.underline}, they argue, [that we see how such **care
functions strategically**]{.underline}, as a way of signalling to
indigenous peoples and the wider world that things are getting better.
[Care]{.underline}, they suggest, '[**signals hope** for the
better]{.underline}' [yet, on closer inspection, is **revealed to
be**]{.underline} '**[dangerous]{.underline}**' [and]{.underline} indeed
'**[colonial]{.underline}**' (Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022: 101).
**[Hope]{.underline}** itself has to be understood [as another element
of]{.underline} such **[colonialism]{.underline}**, they argue, for
[acts of care are designed to]{.underline} '[reproduce
hope]{.underline}' (Lindroth & SinevaaraNiskanen, 2022: 101).
[Expressions of a will to **care** **enable** Arctic regimes to
implement a]{.underline} '**[politics of hope]{.underline}**'
[which]{.underline}, in turn, [**extends** their **colonial rule** over
indigenous peoples]{.underline} (Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022:
101). As Claes Tängh Wrangel has well argued, [**hope**, like care, is a
**biopolitical technology**]{.underline} (Tängh Wrangel, 2019: 669);
[its function is to **enable regimes** of power **to govern** the
**life** of the populations which they target, and
**produce**]{.underline} '**[hopeful subjects]{.underline}**' [whose
**orientation** to the future is **secure** and **not** **dangerous to
political power**. **Subjects without hope**, it is **feared** in the
United States]{.underline}, for example, [are more likely to turn into
suicide bombers]{.underline} (Tängh Wrangel, 2019: 672). [In the Arctic,
there is a comparable set of linkages between care, hope and suicide
that are equally biopolitical]{.underline}. The Arctic Council has been
particularly proactive in tackling the suicide crisis in the Arctic, not
just among the Inuit but among wider indigenous communities as well. It
is essential therefore that the Council's policies towards suicide be
subjected to the same kind of biopolitical scrutiny that Stevenson has
given to those of the Canadian state.

Foscari. Serie orientale Vol. 59 -- Supplement -- December 2023//Jean
Devon Rousseau)

**[The "character of the self"]{.underline}** is something well
discussed in philosophy and social theory. From the Greek classics to
the twentieth-century French hermeneutics, **[the ideas of virtue,
morality, subjectivity, and agency]{.underline}** have **[been put at
the forefront of most of the important debates]{.underline}** in these
disciplines. With these in mind, [the character of the self]{.underline}
has been [defined as "the ethical values we place on our own desires and
our relations to others]{.underline}" (Sennett 1998, i). By this, [it is
possible to argue that character depends on the connections a subject
has with the world and its unique reality]{.underline}. In addition, s
Richard Sennet puts it, individuals become and concern ["the personal
traits which we value in ourselves and for which we seek to be valued by
others"]{.underline} (1998, i), [having]{.underline} sustainable,
lomg-term [goals and sentiments as the items that serve the character of
a subject]{.underline}.. According to Michel Foucault (1993), **[the
self is complex in the sense that techniques of domination can permeate
subjectivity]{.underline}**. In other words, the self can be modified by
either internal or external constraints that will, in one way or
another, interfere in its nature and the way in which exists and is
perceived.

That is, because of **[this permeability of selfhood]{.underline}**, the
**[individuals]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** current **[neoliberal
societies]{.underline}** seem to **[constitute themselves as
subjects]{.underline}** only **[through]{.underline}** becoming
subjected to **[domination and disciplinary tools and
discourses]{.underline}**. That is, [individuals constitute their agency
by means of the projection of the individualism, privatisation and
selfishness that neoliberalism has internally inflicted]{.underline} in
them. **[These aspects, in turn, originate and build upon the thoughts
and choices of the subjects]{.underline}** themselves, **[modifying the
way they act according to a specific logic]{.underline}**. Here, as [a
subject that is bound together to agency, the self falls
into]{.underline} the danger of having **[a morality colonised by such
domination tools]{.underline}**. If one takes these statements into
account and transmutes them into current capitalism, connections can be
drawn between the notion and character of self and current capitalism.
In addition, a link can be made to see how current capitalism has a note
worthy impact on the framing and nature of selfhood in this specific
system. Using a quote by the novelist Salman Rushdie, i**[t seems that
the modern self in neoliberal societies is "a shaky edifice we build out
of scraps, dogmas]{.underline}**, childhood injuries, newspaper
articles, chance remarks, old films, **[small victories, people hated,
people loved]{.underline}**" (1992, 12). Thus, these dynamics help us
highlight the impact of societal and cultural dynamics into the
formation of the nature of the self.

In a Foucauldian frame, [**discourse** is among the **key vectors of

field]{.underline} (Weiss and Wodak 2003; Reisigl and Wodak 2009; Wodak
1989; Chouliaraki and Fairclough 2002). [Such a social field cannot be
conceived pre- or non-symbolically, since it is constituted in part by
symbolic entities and relationships such as texts, utterances, social
actions, roles, and role expectations]{.underline}; however, neither can
it be conceived in a non-political way. [**Every signification of a
social field is** therefore **politically consequential**, in the sense
that **it shifts** the **perceptions, concerns, and** ultimately the
**actions** of the polis.]{.underline}

**[Power]{.underline}**, therefore, [**flows through discourse**, and
thanatos **political discourse is the signification of the governance
and management of death**]{.underline} -- not as an expression of naked
sovereignty but as a topic of negotiation, subject to both fear and
desire. That discourse is *embodied* is implied by the above definition,
but the implications are not necessarily spelled out. [The **embodiment
of discourse** means quite simply that meaning can be and is articulated
in bodies.]{.underline} The description of a body, the naming of its
parts, the placement of that body within a diagnostic taxonomy (which is
also a political act, see Jutel (2011, 2015)), [the telling of a story
about that body]{.underline} (Frank 2010), **[is rarely \"purely
linguistic\" but has a productive, generative function.]{.underline}**

Discourse is of course not the only vector of power, but it is available
for analysis in a way that other vectors are not. In other words,
thanatopolitics can be observed in many ways -- discourse is one avenue
of access. Disability studies has known this since its inception; the
discourse-analytical strain is restricted to works that explicitly use
the term (Snyder and Mitchell 2000; Corker and French 1999) or even in
the rich Foucauldian subfield inaugurated by Tremain (2005), but can be
found in as diverse a range of examples as Oliver\'s critique of the
wording of surveys (1990), Norden\'s study of narrative representation
of disability in film (1994), and Titchkosky\'s investigation of the
relationship between disability iconography and the built environment
(2011). In each case, the analytical object is, in part, the process by
which multiform, protean experience is rendered into symbolically stable
-- and prescriptive -- structures. **[Thanatopolitical
discourse]{.underline}**, then, [consists of symbolic structures where
**death** is **imbued with** a particular kind of
**meaning**]{.underline}; of particular interest for this essay is how
it renders *a meaningful death* for *a disabled life*.

I am assuming here that [**thanatos political discourse**, like any
discourse, **is structured by recurrence** and by the conventionality
**of the mechanisms that produce meaning.**]{.underline} Together,
[**these provide the grounds for and the legitimation of social
action**, scripts that may be adhered to, trajectories that may be
followed. **Justifications may be explicit or implicit**; they may be
**articulated or not**, but they are **always present in the
relationship between an action and its context**, between figure and
ground.]{.underline} Toulmin referred to **[the links of justification
as warrants]{.underline}** (Toulmin 1958); they are present in the
commonplaces, the *loci communes*, the *topoi* (Green-Pedersen 1984)
that **[are the landscape-defining features of a
discourse-field.]{.underline}** Learning to recognize them is learning
to recognize the discourse itself. The concept of the \"right to die\"
is a commonplace and a topos (Reinhardt 2003; Slomkowski 1997; Aristotle
1960), since it is a place of argument and a place where argument
happens. What, then, is the argument being made by the narrative of the
disabled person choosing to die?

#### Discourse affects our brain chemistry through inscribing power relations -- that requires active rhetorical resistance to disrupt.

**Wilson** **24** (Eli Wilson, graduate student studying rhetorical
field methods at the University of Washington; 9-9-24; "Critical
Neurorhetorics and False Justifications"; DOI;

[Neurorhetorics provides a useful starting point to critically unpack
the ways in which we are conditioned to see emotion and feeling as in
direct opposition to logic, reason, and normative
belonging.]{.underline} Thus, we open up pathways for understanding how
[th**e brain is bound up in discursive power struggles**]{.underline}: "
. . . the goal of neurorhetorics---if such a term can be used--- would
be to investigate the rhetorical appeal, effects, and implications of
this prefix, neuro-" (Jack 406). [**The brain** itself **becomes a nodal
point in** a much larger conversation of **how bodies are hierarchized**
in order to establish which bodies are ab/normal and
valuable/not]{.underline} (Dolmage). For my purposes, I would like to
focus on conversations around brains that feel and minds that are
developing. I seek potential pathways in contemporary discourse that are
worth examining by using an approach that combines critical theory and
methods with neurorhetorics, specifically focusing on how affects about
the developing brain impact the negotiation of identity politics in the
current cultural milieu.

While neurological discourse may not seem like a natural entry point for
a critical conversation about cultural and political issues, I argue
that the felt unnaturalness is exactly why we ought to do so. Rhetorical
scholars such as Raymie McKerrow push rhetoricians to critically
question the boundaries of our practice. Scholars like James Jasinski
remind us that the role of the rhetorical critic is to chart "political
judgment and the relationship between judgment and discursive practice,"
(259). Thus, [it is part and parcel of the practice of rhetorical
criticism to search for new avenues of inquiry; new conversations that
can shed light on how the circulation of particular discourses
create]{.underline} "[contexts that make critical meaning, judgment, and
action expansive, provocative, generative]{.underline}; in a word,
powerful" (Morris 32).

In a deeply fragmented world, [focusing critical rhetorical attention on
the prefix "neuro-" and related sociocultural discourses]{.underline}
provides benefits. First, it [allows scholars to examine how normative
notions of the mind and its development are deployed within
rhetoric.]{.underline} For example, when looking at the discourses
surrounding legislation that would ban critical race theory from the
school curriculum, it is clear that how minds are educated is of utmost
concern. Some White parents cite worries that their children will feel
disturbed by the content or feel too guilty to properly learn in the
classroom (see "Introducing"). Others claim that minds that are
blissfully and willfully ignorant of racial matters are preferable,
because it allows for a happier life (see Cabrera, Franklin, and
Watson). Implicit references to the neurological abound: knowledge is
needed to shape young minds, but one presumably must be careful of the
kind of knowledge with which we saddle them. Rhetorical appeals of
safety and protection become bolstered by an affective discourse that
claims that talking about race is simply too bound up in feelings of
guilt and shame for White children to endure in their educational
environment. [An examination of how race and the neurological work
together in this rhetoric is made possible from a critical
neurorhetorical standpoint that unpacks the empirical manifestations and
circulations of ideology in argumentation.]{.underline}

Additionally, [a critical neurorhetoric is able to provide insight into
how **discourses of civility** and appropriateness **reinforce
hierarchical notions of what minds matter.**]{.underline} To give an
example, legislation aimed at banning drag shows contains and reflects
an affectively anxious discourse of exposing children to the
"inappropriate" too early in their lives; drag shows supposedly harm
development, and the legislation seeks to "protect" cis/straight
children but at the expense of queer children and adults (see
Hernández). Claiming drag shows are too sexually expressive for
children, or that drag queens are sexually deviant/perverse individuals
sets up an argument that young minds must suppress sex and expressions
of sexuality and gender that stray too far from the normative. Such
arguments prioritize the development of heteronormative children, while
young queer minds receive the message early that they have somehow been
contaminated.

These examples represent only some of many competing cultural discourses
that draw on neurorhetorics. Crucially, [**discursive frameworks** help
to **uphold** current **regimes of power.**]{.underline} Thus, [I take a
moment to draw our collective attention to the ways that we might use
rhetorics of mind]{.underline} and childhood development [to critically
engage with complex and often highly contested cultural and political
issues as rhetorical scholars.]{.underline} As McKerrow states in his
landmark piece on critical rhetoric, "[The aim is to understand the
integration of power/knowledge in society]{.underline}---[what
possibilities for change the integration invites or inhibits and what
intervention strategies might be considered appropriate to effect social
change]{.underline}" (91). [**Neuroscience** and the brain **invite**
modes of **rhetorical resistance**, especially when initially staged as
a shabby support structure for unfounded claims.]{.underline}

### ---AT: Fairness

#### Their outcry of fairness is the invocation of a racialized, anti-queer peril against critical argumentation that congeals violence in debate.

**Larsen 23** (Beau Larsen; 2023; "INDEBTED: THE COMPOUNDING POLITICS OF
BLACK AND TRANS ARGUMENTATION IN INTERCOLLEGIATE POLICY DEBATE";
https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=cad#page=44)
-- Langham EY

The over-arching and racialized impasse over "traditional" and
"critical" modes of argumentation contextualizes trans argumentation's
varied reception. [There are those in the community who take the
student-scholars engaged in **trans argumentation** seriously and
meaningfully engage trans criticism(s) by preparing responses and
counters.]{.underline} At the same time, [there are those that disparage
it as another instantiation of inherently individualistic,
identityfocused argumentation that **threatens the future of the
activity.**]{.underline} Efforts to foreclose Black radical
argumentation and the larger constellation of arguments indebted to
Black radical invention contour the recognition and growth of trans
argumentation. Moreover, [**disparagements against queer** and trans
**argumentation** are]{.underline} often [**deployed to repudiate Black
argumentation** and thus, critiques of queer and trans argumentation can
provide further evidence of how **anti-Blackness subtends** the **divide
between traditional and critical argumentation** in debate.]{.underline}
For example, it has been common for coaches and debaters to evoke gender
and sexuality arguments as an emblematic reason for why debate should
not tolerate critical argumentation to counterbalance claims that the
community divide over form is inherently racialized. Responding to a
2012 forum discussion about the importance of considering a resolution
that does not adhere to the policymaking framework is coach Scott
Elliott who calls for the community to "imagine a world," where debate
tolerates the inclusion of "personal politics": he gives the example of
a defense of reproductive rights that includes a narrative of sexual
violence, followed by, "Or, how about, 'I personally am resolved that
homosexuals deserve equal rights. I am gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender
\[pick one\], and my dad called me bad names when I came out of the
closet\...\....your turn to go negative'" (Elliott, 2012). How should we
read the ways in which arguments about gender are targeted by the same
naysayers to black argumentation? I pose that we should not understand
rhetoric such as Elliott's as a demonstration that queer and trans
argumentation is targeted with the same intensity, or in the same way,
as Black argumentation. Rather, [the **racialized coding of critical
debate** in the 21st century has to inform how we read disparagements of
queer and trans argumentation. These **criticisms** unjustly
**oversimplify critical arguments** and cohere around the myth that only
minoritarian populations possess experience with]{.underline} (and in
other words, are the only ones shaped by) [the systemic forces of race,
class, gender and sexuality.]{.underline} Here, [**queer** and trans
**argumentation** is **pointed** towards **as undebatable**, and
debate's end point, because of gender's alleged attachment to the
personal]{.underline}---[clarifying the white and cisgender **imperative
that race** and **gender are private concerns not fit for public
deliberation**, instead of disavowed but always already publicly debated
phenomenon that have long shaped the modern public sphere.]{.underline}
While Elliott's comment does not mention Black argumentation by name, it
is clear from an insider vantage point that the multiyear long
disagreement over Louisville's argumentative inventions subtends
Elliott's 2012 forum post. Elliott's disparagement evokes Joseph
Zompetti's (2004) [**fear that argumentation** **emerging from raced**
and **gendered** **vantage points operate as trump cards** that leave
those outside]{.underline} (in this case, white, cisheterosexual people)
[with nothing to say.]{.underline} Once again, [these coaches and
scholars publicly assert that they agree that racism, classism,
homophobia and transphobia are problems in and out of the community but
they disagree with the ways in which students break the stylistic
protocols of the fait accompli model and tabula rasa framework. These
coaches and **debaters call** incessantly for **judges to "hold the
wall"** **against critical** modes of **argumentation** and the ways in
**which** they **create a "slippery slope" to debate's
demise.**]{.underline}

[Coaches]{.underline} and scholars [continue to refigure their
criticism]{.underline}(s) [against]{.underline} the emergence and rise
of [critical scholarship]{.underline} in the wake of the University of
Louisville's Malcolm X Debate Society. [But at the **core of** these
**criticism**]{.underline}([s]{.underline}) [is an **unwillingness for
those that benefit from**]{.underline}, instead of endure, [the
prolonged and complex **violence**]{.underline}(s) [**of racist** and
**gendered violence to be implicated as agents in the production of such
violence**, **in** and out of **debate rounds.**]{.underline} And [on
top of this is an unfluctuating **dismissal of
criticism**]{.underline}([s]{.underline}) [attempting to map out
institutional violence.]{.underline} For example, coach [Michael
Greenstein argued]{.underline} in 2014 [that the bedrock of policy
debate is at risk because the activity is being overtaken by debaters
who "accuse other students, coaches, and even entire institutions of
being racist and/or sexist"]{.underline} (Greenstein, 2014, p. 70).
[Greenstein's argument, articulated in various fashions by those who
share his viewpoint, **postures** that **student-scholars**
**investigating** interpersonal and **institutional racism** and sexism
are **risking debate's future.**]{.underline} In this example,
gender-based argumentation is proximately tied to Black argumentation.
Coaches and debaters cite feminist, queer, and trans argumentation as a
way to disbar anti-racist critique and provide cover against accusations
that the divide is uniquely rooted in anti-Black racism. [**Attacks on
queer**, trans and feminist **argumentation** become a technique to
**congeal** the **anti-Black animus** integral to the contemporary fault
lines between traditional and critical debate. The move to **invoke
race** and **gender arguments as** a **homogenized threat** that is
**overtaking debate** not only works to **delegitimize structural
criticism**]{.underline}([s]{.underline}) [but to conjure the idea that
there is not important work to be done in understanding, and responding
to, the ways in which categories of race and gender interact, impact
each other and inform institutional policy. **To deny harm
investigation** of invisibilized and quotidian violence is to
**maintain** the **establishment** and rule of power that grants safety
to some on the backs of others.]{.underline} Non-Black scholars in the
activity ought to parse out the ways in which anti-Blackness informs the
argumentative atmosphere of intercollegiate policy debate and pursue
theories and political strategies that reckon with the force
anti-Blackness. It is essential that non-Black trans argumentation
attend to its Black debt and create insurgent contestations that subvert
the reach and grasp of state power, including the ways power manifests
within ourselves and our relational networks. Repayment of debt is both
undesired and an impossibility. Trans argumentation and political
organizing must stay with the insistent force of Black radicalism,
forging trans social infrastructures that bloom creativity and rebellion
while dispersing institutional scrutiny and political practice against
anti-Blackness. Responding to violence against trans people necessitates
attending to racial formation, including its operation within anti-trans
backlash and trans organizing. Debating in and at the edges and overlaps
of institutional violence is an essential component of debt work.

[According to Sami activists, the **consultations concerning the
building of the wind power plants are** often **a sham**, a process
where reindeer herders enter with **no change to influence the project
itself**. Kårtveit quotes a local activist in Tana, as the activist
says:]{.underline}

> where the herders can accept or object, it doesn't make a different.
> But if you've showed up, they can say they've engaged in a
> dialogue]{.underline} (Kårtveit 2021, 166).

Furthermore, in the statement by Keskitalo, quoted in the beginning of
this thesis, she refers to the conflict around the Alta dam. Going back
to the 1970s, a controversy around a hydro power project in Alta became
the turning point for Sami struggle for cultural recognition and
indigenous rights in Norway (Kårtveit 2021). The hydro power project
involved the flooding of nature reserve of great importance to the Sami
community. An alliance of Sami and environmental activists campaigned
against the proposal (Greaves 2018, 114). Even though the hydro power
project was built, the struggle against the Alta dam was the turning
point for Sami rights and recognition. In fact, the Alta conflict led
the Norwegian authorities to commission a public report on the Sami's
cultural and political rights (Sametinget.no). In 1989, the Sami
Parliament was opened as an indigenous parliament with the role to
improve the Sami political position and promote Sami interests and is
today primarily a political body for the Sami people (Ibid). The Sami
Parliament is the prime dialogue partner for the Norwegian government in
its Sami policy. Yet, with the recognition of Sami and Sami rights, the
public report on the Sami's cultural and political rights, and the
opening of the Sami Parliament, members of the Sami community express a
vast asymmetry in relations between the Sami and the developers in terms
of power and resources when decisions about these wind power plants are
made. [Even though the Sami Parliament is the prime dialogue partner for
the Norwegian government in its Sami policy, the **Sami parliament have
no influence in the decision-making.**]{.underline} Going back to the
windfarms on Fosen, the Sami parliament of Norway sent a complain to
United Nation's "International Convention on the Elimination of All
forms of Racial Discrimination" concerning Norway's disrespect of the
Sami culture by building the wind farms on areas essential to Sami
reindeer herding. The United Nation asked Norwegian government to
temporary stop the building process until they had a chance to consider
the complaint. However, The Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy
decided to reject United Nation's request and thus allowed the
continuation of the building process (Thobroe 2018). Moreover, [Kårtveit
quotes a prominent member of the Sami Parliament as the member
says:]{.underline}

> [If they (reindeer herders) argue to meet with the wind power
> developers, and are presented with the plans, **they can make their
> objection, but those will be ignored.** And **once you've met with
> them, the developers can say that they've engaged in a dialogue with
> you and tried but failed to reach a shared
> understanding**]{.underline} (Kårtveit 2021, 166).

Kårtveit argues that [t**he concept of "dialogue" serves to conceal the
vast asymmetry in power and resources between the industrial developers
and the local Sami herders** as **the concept create an impression that
they have been included in the decision-making process**]{.underline}
(2021, 166). [The concept of dialogue indicates a meeting taking place
on level playing field. In general, Sami activists engaging with
industrial agents in their home areas rarely find themselves operating
on a level playing field]{.underline} (Kårtveit 2021, 167). **[The
exclusion from decision-making processes concerning their land and
interests continue to put Sami people in a position of being

Contextualising Resource-Extraction

In context of the previously argued pursuit of resource extraction
control and expansion and its implicit relation with the acceptable
oppression on circumpolar minorities, [the exercise of modern
**sovereignty** can be understood as a **balancing** act between
**facetiously upholding international treaties** on fundamental human
rights **and misusing** the **structures in place** to uphold them **to
instead justify** larger **expansions into** the **non-recognised
territories of indigenous peoples.**]{.underline} Let us examine this
misuse of existing structure on the mining expansionism within the
Arctic Circle.

[The **Arctic resource-front** especially in the context of mineral
mining is **characterised by** a close **collaboration between**
national **mining companies, international conglomerates** with
significant mining industry aspects of their portfolios, and the
**national** **governance.**]{.underline} (Hanaček 2022) [**Common
lands** continue to be **propertised, altering** existing **Sámi
settlements** and reindeer-herding pathways, **to develop** **new mining
sites** for domestic and foreign capital expansion.]{.underline}
(Naykanchina 2012) [The importance of collaboration between the
nation-state and the mining industry cannot be understated in the
context of Sámi dispossession - the access to the mining process is a
complex endeavour for most corporations and mostly takes an
"all-or-nothing" shape where the requirement for a profitable,
sustainable mining operation is the grant of complete exclusive rights
on the area of the mining operation.]{.underline} (Amatulli 2014) In
general, the negotiation process on accession to mining is more complex
within developed economies and easier within developing economies,
however, [the unprecedented access to raw **resources** within the
Arctic made available by the changing climate only **incentivises** the
**sacrifice of environmental and indigenous considerations on the altar
of economic growth.**]{.underline} (Hanaček 2022) [This is further
incentivised by the growing global demand for both metals and rare
minerals necessary for sustainable energetic solutions]{.underline}, a
market that is expected to expand significantly throughout the
implementation of the European Green Deal and similar sustainability
projects around the world. (Haddaway 2022) The process can be
generalised into three aspects - exploration licence, where private
capital can begin to explore and assess areas designated for mining,
granted for up to 7 years in Norway 11 and up to 15 in Sweden 12 (in
Finland 13 , this is the "prospecting permit" granted for 4 years); the
exploitation permit pertaining to official extraction, granted for 25
years in Sweden, until exhaustion of resource in Norway, and with
unfixed time in Finland; and finally, the environmental permit, based on
environmental considerations developed by both the companies and
governmental body, and a general impact evaluation 11;12;13 .

While environmental considerations play a significant role in the access
to mining procedure in Norway, Sweden and Finland alike, research shows
that 1) it is demonstrable that such considerations are not fully
restative of the consequences of decades-long mining processes,
especially in context of indigenous lands, even when 12 out of 15 metal
mines in Sweden are situated on ancestral Sámi land (Raitio et al.
2020); 2) lack of research into long-term consequence of mining in the
Arctic, such as waste management and maritime disturbances, exists for
such considerations to be guided by this research (Haddaway et al.
2022); and 3) [demonstrably, the entire process of **environmental**
**considerations** is significantly **misguided** and **does not
include** any **meaningful engagement outside of the State**
superstructure, such as **with** rights holders, who in this context are
the **indigenous people**, and stakeholders such as environmental
protection organisations and other expert bodies.]{.underline} (ibid.)
Generally speaking, [the **environmental assessment** is in place merely
to **satisfy** **international law regulations** for resource extraction
and **does not pose** a **genuine obstacle to mining
accession**]{.underline} - such obstacles are mostly found within the
accession talks and exploration periods. (Amatulli 2014)

[This is where international conglomerates with a vested interest in
resource-extraction within circumpolar regions, and consequently, a
multitude of nation-states with no adjacency to the Arctic region sans
their material interests, come into play.]{.underline} Notably, [the
**United States'** **interest** within the region]{.underline} as well
as China's ad hoc observer status in the Arctic Council both [seem to be
**motivated by** immediate **resource-extraction.** Modern **society
lives off extraction** with intensity unparalleled to anything before,
and]{.underline} both the Chinese and [**US expansions of influence**
within the region can be seen as openly conne**cted with future efforts
of capitalising on** some of the untapped **resources** within the
region **that will** also **concern the Sámi**, both indirectly and
directly.]{.underline} (Hanaček 2022) (Sörlin 2022) [The creation of
so-called boomtowns of mining pepper the Arctic Circle - from Alaska and
Canada through Scandinavia to Siberia, resource-races have left behind a
multitude of emptied mines and adjacent infrastructure built to support
resource extraction.]{.underline} (Sokolíčková & Eriksen 2022) [The
significant untapped resource potential of the ancestral lands of
indigenous peoples within the Arctic Circle]{.underline} and
particularly in Swedish and Finnish parts of Sápmi (Hanaček 2022)
[combined with the eroding ecosystems of oceans and faunas
alike]{.underline} (Österlin et al. 2022) [suggest boomtown
establishments throughout continental Scandinavia, especially
considering the vested interest of state-owned conglomerates and
international capital in rare mineral mining being fundamental factors
in the push towards further extraction.]{.underline}

As for the resettlement of Sámi people when mines are established in
lands perused by them, ILOC169 is again the most important piece of
international legislation on the matter. "In cases in which the State
retains the ownership of mineral or subsurface resources or rights to
other resources pertaining to lands, governments shall establish or
maintain procedures through which they shall consult these peoples, with
a view to ascertaining whether and to what degree their interests would
be prejudiced, before undertaking or permitting any programmes for the
exploration or exploitation of such resources pertaining to their lands.
The peoples concerned shall wherever possible participate in the
benefits of such activities, and shall receive fair compensation for any
damages which they may sustain as a result of such activities. 14" and
"Where the relocation of these peoples is considered necessary as an
exceptional measure, such relocation shall take place only with their
free and informed consent. Where their consent cannot be obtained, such
relocation shall take place only following appropriate procedures
established by national laws and regulations, including public inquiries
where appropriate, which provide the opportunity for effective
representation of the peoples concerned. 15" Notably, both Finland and
Norway have codified these provisions within their respective Mining
acts, whereas consultation with the Sámi and the obligation of informing
Sámi communities about mining operations have both been put into
national law. (Amatulli 2014) [**Even** **with** such **provisions**,
the **role of the Sámi in the process is** still **marginal** and their
**right-to-land** is openly **threatened.**]{.underline} While there
were no forced resettlements of the Sámi within the 21st century related
to minings (ibid.), [the **compensation schemes** of voluntary
resettlements **merely** **mitigate** the **economic consequences of
resettlement and give the State a bianco cheque on endangering
traditional lands** used for reindeer-herding and other migratory
purposes in pursuit of multiplying capital and extracting natural
resources throughout Sápmi.]{.underline} (Raitio et al. 2020) (Hanaček

Given that the endgame of Afro-pessimism as an academic enterprise is
limited by its location within the neoliberal university (see Fred Moten
and Stephano Harney's ''The University and the UnderCommons,''), the
most generative aspects of its analysis of anti-blackness and Western
civilization are indebted to knowledge about black life and liberation
produced outside the academy and on the ground of struggles for freedom.
The pessimism of conventional philosophical concern presses on the
ontological foundations of a person's individual sense of agency and
purpose, throwing one's will to live into question. Prophetic despair,
such as that which Baldwin expresses in an often quoted interview
between James Baldwin Dr. Kenneth Clark in May of 1963, presses on the
material cohesion of our moral infrastructure. In the interview Baldwin
professes to remaining pessimistic with regard to his own life when he
says, ''It doesn't matter any longer what you do to me; you can put me
in jail, you can kill me. By the time I was 17, you'd done everything
that you could do to me. The problem now is, how are you going to save

can survive whatever we must survive. But the future of the Negro in
this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the
country (Clark et al., 1963). I want to savor the tensions of Baldwin's
response. I want to hold them, not resolve them, and observe how [they
[situate]{.mark}]{.underline} pedestrian [[**personal pessimism**
outside]{.mark} the [**movement** for **black
life**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while calling out the limits of a political
process propelled and legitimated by white supremacy. Even [**insofar**
as pessimism is a **social expression** of]{.underline} the affective
limits of **[social death]{.underline}**, a feeling that brings us back
to life, out of isolation, and into conversation with each other the
promise of [pessimism is]{.underline} clearly [**far more** than an
**academic matter**]{.underline}. The [[**antithesis** of
pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark} in this instance [[is]{.mark} not
optimism but apathy, willful passive [acceptance of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [**[untenable conditions]{.mark}** of a people
**systemically**]{.underline} and forcibly [made to understand that
there are **some** whose **existence** is]{.underline} at best
immaterial and at worst [a clear and present **danger**]{.underline},
and then there are those **[[lives]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[do
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What [we have been witnessing
in]{.underline} the activist and [**academic** movements for black
life]{.underline} is [the implosion of **identity politics** and the
**failure** of]{.underline} its possessive [claims to **liberal
demands** for]{.underline} rights and **[protection]{.underline}**. The
[[**abolition of whiteness** demands]{.underline}]{.mark} a kind of
justice the state may not yet know how to sanction. As Patrisse Cullors
(2015), one of three original founders of #BLM, argues, ''I believe [we
can't **wait** on the **State**]{.underline} to take care of our Black
lives. [[We]{.mark} have to show up now to [**build the world** we
**want to see**]{.mark}]{.underline}.'' Thinking the purchase of the
pessimistic prophetically then, as a residual, inevitable, yet
generative practice of the black prophetic tradition with reparative
properties that precede and exceed Afro-pessimism's formal incorporation
into scholarly journals and conferences, I find myself constantly
reminding my students that while we can take the analysis of power
Afro-pessimism offers and run with it, academic enunciations of
pessimism run the risk of remaining loyal to the limits of legibility
and respectability of politics as usual. As Nick Mitchell (forthcoming,
p. 10) writes: ''When the intellectual becomes interchangeable with the
slave, it is perhaps too easy ... to smooth over the fact that black
intellectuals have interests as intellectuals that can and do diverge
from those of the people for whom they might want justice. Without an
acknowledgement (not a confession) of this divergence ... the project of
[**race [theorization]{.mark}** [risks]{.mark}]{.underline} deploying
the **[[generalizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** force of theory and the
moralizing tendency of critique to generalize a class perspective.''
[[What we are dealing with]{.mark} here [is **more**
than]{.mark}]{.underline} occidental anxiety of [[**ontological
uncertainty**. It is]{.mark} an **ethical [imperative]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} engage in]{.underline} a [struggle to
**[change]{.mark}**]{.underline} the meaning of [**rights** and
**protection**]{.underline} from the ground up ([or suffer
**senselessly** at the altar of the **state**]{.underline}'s right to
defend itself by any means necessary). As Baldwin (in Clark et al.,
1963) suggested in the interview with Kenneth Clark, the pessimism of
antiblack racism is not just a black problem, it presses on the
condition of whites and upon the country as a whole: ''These people have
deluded themselves for so long, that they really don't think I'm human.
I base this on their conduct, not on what they say, and this means that
they have become, in themselves, moral monsters.'' The predicament of
the pessimist is not a personal problem that is easily selfcontained. It
presses upon the body, moving it to unrest, unleashing a rage that
cannot stand to be at home in moral monstrosity. It just wants to burn
it all down. ''Now, we are talking about human beings, there's not such
a thing as a monolithic wall or some abstraction called the Negro
problem, these are Negro boys and girls, who at 16 and 17 don't believe
the country means anything that it says and don't feel they have any
place here, on the basis of the performance of the entire country.'' The
question Afro-pessimism poses as a practice of prophetic desire then,
turns away from a politics of recognition and respectability toward an
abolitionist praxis of fugitive reparation to ask, ''Will you run with
me?'' Does my pessimism press on your sense of superiority, exception,
perfection enough for you to forfeit your status and help us move the
country, force the nation to believe there is freedom beyond this world,
a more prophetic imagination of difference, identity, and inclusion?
''What white people have to do,'' Baldwin (in Clark et al., 1963)
reminds us, ''is try and find out in their own hearts why it was
necessary to have a nigger in the first place, because I'm not a nigger,
I'm a man, but if you think I'm a nigger, it means you need it.'' In the
present moment Black Lives Matter (**[[BLM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) is
advancing the cause for the abolition of white supremacy in local ways
in chapters throughout the world. They [call us to account
for]{.underline} the [**material** consequences of]{.underline} the
[**unfinished work** of]{.underline} antislavery abolition and
**[reconstruction]{.underline}**. They are part of an underground
lineage of fugitive communities that emerged from the marshes, swamps,
and hiding spaces of the plantation South. Their message is
decentralized. It is not uniform. [It [**does not** reproduce]{.mark}
**old [antagonisms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It does not pit moral suasion
against direct confrontation. [It does not ask that we **choose** to
remain]{.underline} either [**optimistic** or **pessimistic**. It
exercises a practice of the **[political]{.mark}** that **[harnesses
both]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this last section then I turn to a
speech against apathy by Patrisse Cullors, a beacon in a leader-full
movement who has been animating pessimism as a protocol of self-care and
prophetic political organizing powerful enough to propel activist and
intellectual movements from isolated places of loss into collective
liberation, out of abstractions into objections, subjecting the logics
of antiblack racism to the collective force of intersecting fugitive
communities of abolitionist movement [[against
**nihilism**]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[to]{.mark}ward an **[affirmation
of life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We Can Survive? At age 25 on 19 April
2015 Freddie Gray died from injuries sustained while shackled by his
feet in a Baltimore Police Department van where he was being held in
custody following his arrest. Baltimore stood up, rose up, died in, and
rolled out. We all bore witness. His death was deemed a murder by the
medical examiner a few weeks later. That Sunday morning, May 3, 2015, I,
a Buddhist, found my way to church, to All Saints in Pasadena, CA, into
the strikingly upper-class congregation of post-service attendees who
piled in along with an unlikely mix of young greater Los Angeles
activists-of-color and their white hipster allies. It would be my first
time hearing our speaker in person. The whole room stood and cheered as
she entered -- the woman who helped coin the hashtag, the longtime
activist organizer, Patrisse Cullors greeted us like family, all knowing
eyes, bright smiles, and then began a talk she called ''Abolition
Theology.'' Her voice was clear and certain, free of the cross-bearing
affect of black suffering that often accompanies talk of state-sponsored
antiblack violence in predominately white spaces. Cullors gave us a
speech that touched us, that moved us -- mourning, rage and all -- into
a mood for collective action. She impressed upon us the fact that the
movement for black lives was a call to action for all black life, not
just the names we could recite, not just cisgendered young men, not just
''innocent'' ''children,'' not just Americans. She let us know there had
been recent formations of #Black Lives Matter chapters beyond U.S.
borders. There were Afro-Latino chapters, chapters forming in Haiti, and
in Ghana. She reminded us that the concept of blackness that resonates
across the globe called on us to broaden the scope of our movements and
to build alliances, to build with Latino communities in particular. It
was a call for #BLM without borders. We were being enlisted in a
movement that began, she reminded us, with the movement to abolish the
institution of slavery. We were being reeducated as she drew connection
between the hard-won efforts of formerly fugitive abolitionists to build
resilient communities out of the so-called contraband during and
following the Civil War through to the present-day ''leader-full''
movement of #BLM. ''Isn't [this a **great time** to be
**alive**]{.underline}?'' Cullors asked in closing. Is she joking I
wondered? I found not one drop of cynicism in her question. Without
missing a beat, she proceeded to relay the names, the facts, the
numbers, the bodies felled by police, by gun, by force. As she listed
the lives taken a wave of loss flooded the room and we were still,
breathless. ''[Protest is about **disrupting apathy**]{.underline},''
she continued. She left us eager to join her in this twenty-first
century revival of reconstruction, in a [[fight for **food**]{.mark},
for]{.underline} access to **[[housing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for
access to **[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [for a kind of
justice for **black lives** that [will not come
without]{.mark}]{.underline} our [**willingness** to show
up]{.underline}, stand up, and throw down. In the streets, [in
**solidarity**]{.underline}, we will find the power to change people,
she said, [to **change [policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. She echoed the
words of civil rights organizer Ella Baker, ''the system under which we
now exist has to be radically changed... [It means]{.underline} facing a
system that does not lend itself to your needs and [**devising means**
by which you **change that system**]{.underline}.'' For Cullors that
''means'' came by way of waves grief, rage, despair, the loss of family,
the loss of hope, bearing witness, heartbreak, and the will to return to
face it all again. She closed us out with the rallying chant of the
movement for black lives, the recitation of a prayer by Twentieth
century fugitive slave Assata Shakur, ''It is our duty to fight for our
freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and protect each
other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.'' The congregation's joy
burst through the siren of her words and bound us toward another way of
sitting with the litany of loss. We Must Survive What Baldwin and
Cullors make clear is that pessimism is most powerful as an unrelenting
political process of coming back to life, beginning to feel one
another's humanity. What my students who are taking up the work of
Afro-pessimism are in most need of are new ways to put their pessimism
to work, to come together and collectively counteract the mind-numbing
soul-crushing isolation centuries of antiblack racism have waged on our
humanity. We need not fear falling short. The more we ''fail,'' the
stronger we rise to try again armed with the alchemy of despair. What we
need are stories and speeches, and spaces that moves us from abjection
toward that fertile ground of self-transformation one can only find in
the witness of another. What might we give up in a move from critique to
healing and reparation, generative of the choice to be fearless in the
face of the impossibilities of freedom? What might the audacity to
''lean on each other,'' as Jasmine Abdullah Richards says in the
epigraph, and [[imagine]{.mark} a **[future for black
life]{.mark}**]{.underline} otherwise, add to the pursuits of the
pessimist?

#### Presenting a [strategy]{.underline} to solve [suffering]{.underline} isn't [violent]{.underline}.

**Craps '12** \[Steph; 2012; Professor of English at Ghent University,
Director of Centre for Literature and Trauma; Postcolonial Witnessing:
Trauma Out of Bounds, Palgrave, "Conclusion," p. 126-127\]

Cogent though these various critiques are in their own terms, it seems
to me that they unduly homogenize and simplify different forms of
interest in and inquiry into trauma. While it is true, of course, that
trauma research does not in and of itself lead to political
transformation, I would argue that a **[[trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**
theory revised along the lines I have suggested [[is not]{.mark}
destined to serve as the handmaiden of the status quo or [a]{.mark} mere
academic [**alibi** for]{.mark} the indulgence of **[voyeuristic
inclinations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[it can]{.mark}
help identify and [understand]{.mark} situations of
**[exploitation]{.mark} and abuse**[, and act as]{.mark} an
[**incentive** for]{.mark} the kind of sustained and systemic [critique
of]{.mark} **societal [conditions]{.mark}** called for by Berlant and
Brown]{.underline}. In fact, [the expanded **model of [trauma]{.mark}**
I have proposed, [based on]{.mark}]{.underline} the work of Laura Brown,
Frantz [**[Fanon]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} others, bears a close
resemblance to the model of suffering that [Berlant [puts
forward]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[an
**alt**]{.mark}**ernative**]{.underline} to the (traditional) trauma
model, which she finds inadequate: \"[a model of suffering, whose
etymological [articulation of **pain**]{.mark} and patience [draws its
**subject** less as an **effect** of]{.mark} an act of [**violence** and
more as]{.mark} an effect of [a]{.mark} **general [atmosphere]{.mark}**
[of it, peppered by **acts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to be sure, but not
contained by the presumption that trauma carries, that it is an effect
of a single scene of violence or toxic taxonomy\" (338). Berlant\'s
observation that \"the pain and suffering of subordinated subjects in
everyday life is an ordinary and ongoing thing that is underdescribed by
the (traumatic) identity form and its circulation in the state and the
law\" (344) is perfectly in line with the argument I have presented in
this book.

[That **trauma [research]{.mark}** [can act as a **catalyst**
for]{.mark} astute **[political]{.mark} analysis** and **meaningful
[activism]{.mark}**]{.underline} would seem to be borne out by the \[END
PAGE 126\] development in Fanon\'s writing, from Black Skin, White
Masks, which describes the psychological impact of racial and colonial
oppression, to the overtly political The Wretched of the Earth, which
confronts the source of the mental strife he saw in the clinic.3 Since
Douglas Crimp\'s plea for \"\[m\]ilitancy, of course, then, but mourning
too: mourning and militancy\" (18) in relation to the AIDS movement back
in 1989, several scholars have argued that an interest in issues of
[trauma, loss, and mourning is in fact compatible with a commitment to
radical activism. A desire [to make **visible** the]{.mark} creative and
[**political**-rather than **pathological**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and
negative-aspects of an [**attachment** to loss]{.mark}]{.underline} is
the thread that binds together the essays gathered in David Eng and
David Kazanjian\'s volume Loss: The Politics of Mourning (2003), which
seeks to \"extend\[\] recent scholarship in trauma studies by insisting
that ruptures of experience, witnessing, history, and truth are, indeed,
a starting point for political activism and transformation\" (10). Eng
and Kazanjian see their collection as moving \"from trauma to prophecy,
and from epistemological structures of unknowability to the politics of
mourning\" (10). As one of the contributors, Ann Cvetkovich, puts it,
[trauma can be \"the provocation [to create]{.mark} **alternative
[lifeworld's]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (\"Legacies of Trauma\" 453).

[Recognition of suffering serves as [a]{.mark} **necessary first
[step]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}wards the [amelioration]{.mark} of that
suffering]{.underline}. In Judith Butler\'s words, \"The recognition of
[**shared [precariousness]{.mark}** [introduces]{.mark} strong
[normative]{.mark} commitments of [equality]{.mark} and invites a more
robust universalizing of rights that seeks [to address basic]{.mark}
**human [needs]{.mark}**]{.underline} for food, shelter, and other
conditions for persisting and flourishing\" (28-29). Without wishing to
overstate its likely impact, I believe that rethinking trauma studies
from a postcolonial perspective and providing nuanced readings of a wide
variety of narratives of trauma and witnessing from around the world can
help us understand that shared precariousness. By fostering attunement
to previously unheard suffering and putting into global circulation
memories of a broad range of traumatic histories, an inclusive and
culturally sensitive trauma theory can assist in [raising awareness of
injustice]{.underline} both past and present [and opening up the
possibility of a more just global future]{.underline}-and, in so doing,
remain faithful to the ethical foundations of the field.5

### 2AC---Fiat Good

#### Fiat embodies a [prefigurative politics]{.underline}. Acting [as if]{.underline} reforms are being enacted, enables counter-hegemonic norms and rewrites the conditions that perpetuate flawed institutions.

reposing of what's real," The Sociological Review, 68(5), pp. 893-916
/jpb

Earlier, I discussed the controversy over reforming state law to treat
gender as an elective identity. In this final example, I want to
approach prefigurative law reform from a different angle and ask: [what
value is there in a **research project [acting as if]{.mark} more
[radical proposals]{.mark}**]{.underline} around gender [[were on the
law reform table?]{.underline}]{.mark}47 In their 2017/18 consultation
on reforming the Gender Recognition Act, [policy-makers in]{.underline}
both [Scotland and England and Wales solicited public views on how and
whether to make gender transitioning easier and less
pathologising]{.underline}. Questions posed included: how many
transitions can someone have; to what genders; at what age; and through
what means?48 [Yet, a more fundamental question remained unasked, even
as it became tacitly invoked by the move towards self-determination and
the growing gender-neutrality of statutory law: Are there good reasons
for people to continue to be legally gendered, issuing from the sex
registered at birth?]{.underline} This 'decertification' question
(Cooper & Renz, 2016) is at the heart of a three-year collaborative
research project on the Future of Legal Gender (FLaG).49

In Britain, [different social relations structure people's
lives]{.underline}, as they also structure the law, [but many --
including ethnicity, sexuality and religion -- **do not give rise to a
legally assigned personal status**, for instance as gay or
Jewish]{.underline}. In contrast, the [formal legal status accorded
sex/gender places people within defined categories and obliges them to
undergo official procedures for their status to change]{.underline}.
Legal gender status doesn't just affect those who need to transition or
who object to the category they are placed within. The symbolic
importance which the law attaches to a binary structure, in requiring
birth-sex to be registered, suggests that sex -- lived socially as
gender -- marks a distinction that is human-shaped and that matters.
This is not just a critical mattering; it is also a normative claim
about who and what we are (see Cooper & Emerton, 2020). [But what
alternative arrangements are possible?]{.underline} And [[can a
**prefigurative**]{.mark} **law [reform]{.mark} project** help to
anticipate and [establish pathways for reform?]{.mark} We might think of
prefiguration here as having **two dimensions**. The first centres on
process, and the challenge of [undertaking]{.mark} a **[mock]{.mark} law
[reform project]{.mark}** in collaborative, critically reflexive
ways]{.underline} (see also Macdonald & Kong, 2006, p. 27). The
[second]{.underline}, which I want to consider, [involves [taking
a]{.mark} radical [proposal, **not**]{.mark} **currently [on the]{.mark}
law reform [table]{.mark}**[, and **acting as if it was**]{.mark}
**already [under review]{.mark}**, and so **accelerating its detailed
consideration**]{.underline} (if not its enactment). De Smet's (2015)
discussion of Vygotsky and 'proleptic learning' is useful here.
[Proleptic learning involves 'anticipat\[ing\] or imagin\[ing\]
competence through the representation of a future act or development as
already existing']{.underline} (de Smet, 2015, p. 91). [A prefigurative
law reform project comes to **understand the implications of legal
change** by acting as if the questions and choices at stake were
**reasonable to attend to in the present**]{.underline}. But [does this
assume that what we learn today about future possible changes to legal
gender status **will retain their value?** In the case of law reform,
the life expectancy of imagined consequences can be brief as conditions
change]{.underline}, lessening the benefits of earlier rehearsal. [I
therefore want to consider the [value of prefigurative]{.mark} law
[reform as]{.mark} an **[intervention in the present (rather
than]{.mark} an effective managing of the
[future]{.mark}**]{.underline}), and to address the significance of the
'as if' in this process.

The [Future of Legal Gender]{.underline} (FLaG) did not represent itself
as an advocacy project. Its [aim was not to argue for a new legal
agenda; that 'decertification' -- understood as the withdrawal of
state-assigned gender status -- should be introduced. But does acting as
if this proposal was already on the law reform table, in effect, put it
there?]{.underline} FLaG certainly lacked the authorising conditions to
render its proposal officially performative (cf. Law & Urry, 2004). It
could not work in illocutionary ways by requiring or ensuring
decertification was given consideration by state bodies, even as it
might contribute to the emergence of a more official proposal in the
future (although a backlash could cause it to have the reverse effect).
Yet, [regardless of whether decertification emerges as a 'real' legal
proposal, as an imagined measure, that also constituted an emergent
methodology for doing socio-legal research, decertification was
saturated with belief that it could act]{.underline}. For our part, [we
hoped its exploration through interviews, seminars and other forms of
public engagement would offer, in the current fraught scene, a more
**exploratory, less judgemental space** for gender's consideration, one
that could incorporate some marginalised perspectives]{.underline},
cleavages and questions. [With politically lower stakes, looser
attachments, and the inevitable temporal space between now and any
future-present of the law reforms proposed, more flexible and plural
conceptualisations of gender might]{.underline} also [be possible, away
from the rigid monolithic definitions]{.underline} -- that this is what
sex or gender really means, for example.

The [value of a **prefigurative law reform project**]{.underline}, then,
[is not]{.underline} just, or even principally, [about preparing (for)
the future but about **alternative discursive lines in the
now**]{.underline}. Yet, [this may suggest prefigurative law reform
projects can insulate themselves and so provide participants with a
politically constructive, 'safe' refuge away from the 'real world' fray.
Law reform projects]{.underline}, however -- including this one -- [are
not that insulated; and this is a source of both difficulty and
challenge]{.underline}. If proposals are seen -- or can be depicted --
as 'real' law-making, or if they get presented as the scary place that
moderate-sounding legal measures will inevitably lead to, this can
intensify divisions and anxieties, undermining the capacity of a
prefigurative law reform project to enact an exploratory deliberative
space. [While it is the credible appearance of [prefigurative]{.mark}
law reform [proposals]{.mark} which [incites]{.mark} serious
[attention]{.mark}, for such attention [to **remain focused on the
merits**]{.mark}]{.underline} (or otherwise) [of the reform [rather
than]{.mark} on ([challenging) its realisation, the '**as if' simulated
character**]{.mark} **of the proposal [needs to be explicitly
sustained]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[[Prefiguration is]{.mark} sometimes [dismissed as]{.mark} a minor form
of politics -- too small-scale and marginal, too [invested in]{.mark}
its own purity]{.underline}, voluntary action, [and
**[dream-world]{.mark} to be a politics that matters**]{.underline} or
that adds much [given the tremendous contemporary crises that we face.
But [without romanticising]{.mark} prefigurative politics **[or
suggesting it is the only politics worth pursuing]{.mark}**, this
discussion works from the assumption that [prefiguration]{.mark} remains
[important]{.mark}]{.underline}, including -- and, perhaps,
**[[especially]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- at times of political despair
[[when]{.mark} much needed "[transfers of power" seem out of
reach]{.mark}]{.underline}. This article has sought to contribute to
prefigurative thinking by focusing on institutions in conjunction with a
specific form of prefiguration, attuned to the 'as if'. Drawing on
research I have carried out, including collaboratively, over two
decades, it draws together four very different kinds of prefigurative
activity: (1) where local government acts as if it has authority to
engage in international policy-making and global solidarity despite
countervailing national government policies, authority and alliances;
(2) where state law acts as if it has the authority to establish
gender's terms and categories, including by changing understandings of
gender's meaning in the process; (3) where grass-roots communities act
as if they have the power and right to remake institutions of money and
state; and (4) [where researchers **act as if a different, more radical
proposal was already on the law reform table**, and so deserving of
serious consideration]{.underline}.

At the heart of this discussion lies the question: [what do such
initiatives create; and what does reading them as prefigurative make
visible?]{.underline} Typically, work on prefigurative politics and
counter-institutions foregrounds three features: learning, practising
and showcasing. This article has considered how [[prefiguring
institutions innovates]{.mark}, energises, stimulates, anticipates,
hurries and normalises]{.underline}. However, in understanding what
prefiguring does, this article has also foregrounded a different, less
attended-to aspect, namely how [prefiguring institutions mediates,
reconstitutes [and **troubles**]{.mark} **the [interrelationship
of]{.mark} the [real to]{.mark} the [imaginary]{.mark}** (recognising
the imaginary is also, in its own sense, real]{.underline}; cf. Bottici,
2014). This relationship comes to the fore in the authorising conditions
that prefiguration relies upon, and the work recognition does (and
doesn't) do, within diffuse and unequal circuits of power.

A central paradox of [prefiguration]{.underline} is that it [takes the
meanings, conditions and legitimacy it seeks **as if they already
existed**]{.underline}. In a sense, [we might describe it as a form of
retro-figuring, reliant on imagined antecedents that
authorise]{.underline}, for instance, [**councils' engagement in foreign
policy** and street squatters' state secession. For while prefiguration
**takes up future-oriented aspirations as enactable present-day
practices and norms**, it also relies on this future as already in place
to authorise the actions it undertakes]{.underline}. This can be read as
an imagined form of backfilling undertaken playfully or seriously. But
[this]{.underline} backfilling [can also prove performative --
retrospectively creating the authorising conditions relied
upon]{.underline}. Local government's legitimate capacity to engage in
international policymaking, for instance, is not predetermined. However,
while municipalities may act as if they have authority -- putting
permissions or entitlements in place by treating them as if they were
already there -- whether this proves successful depends on what councils
and the network of actors, who support, thwart or otherwise affect
council actions, also do.

Acting as if the necessary conditions are already in place, particularly
when undertaken seriously, can be challenged. But the challenging (and
other) effects of intervening bodies also structures forward-oriented
conditions of accomplishment, and one important process here is how
recognition happens. The [prefigurative acts]{.underline} discussed [are
not siloes. Their existence]{.underline}, effects and force [are
mediated by mainstream institutions along with other
bodies]{.underline}, and this mediation also shapes how and whether
institutional prefiguration is recognised as 'real' (and so not read in
the terms of the 'as if'). For while prefiguration can involve
deliberately reaching beyond what can be accomplished, [it can also be a
way of reading initiatives and reforms that receive insufficient
recognition to be realised]{.underline}, and which lack the force to
bring such recognition into effect. At the same time, recognition as
real is far from uncomplicatedly positive. Initiatives may be framed as
'wrongly real', and so subject to criticism and attack as municipal
boycotts and legislative consultation on recognising a third gender
experienced. Recognition as real-like may also carry costs as local
currencies encountered, shoe-horned into a restrictive and penal wider
welfare culture. In such conditions, it may seem as if explicit
recognition as 'not-real' is preferable -- where simulations are
authorised and validated as imaginative ventures not intended to pass.
[Approaching initiatives in this way might prefigure a more explicitly
experimental and playful politics]{.underline}. While Frestonia shows
how recognition as play can trivialise and dismiss, it can also protect
initiatives by diminishing their threat. [Instead of being denounced as
grievous or seditious, initiatives become forms of **invention, art, or
recreation**, occupying a separate, bounded play-world in which their
claims can stand]{.underline}. But what happens when the tacit contract
is broken, and prefigurative play seeps out?

[It is tempting to suggest that prefiguring institutions needs to **come
out either on the side of fictive play or on the side of an ambition to
be recognised as real**]{.underline}. However, [at its heart,
prefiguration]{.underline} -- whether [as a political orientation,
specific form of practice, or register of understanding]{.underline} --
[involves the complex relationship between the imaginary, the fictive
and the real]{.underline}. At one level, [[acting as if]{.mark} things
were otherwise [invokes]{.mark} a **[conscious distinction
between]{.mark} the [real and]{.mark} the
[fictive]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [where the imaginary is juxtaposed
against what is realised as true]{.underline}. At another level, [acting
'as if' undoes the distinction as actions based on counterhegemonic
understandings and norms change what is (and what is
becoming]{.underline}). But [prefiguration also embodies]{.underline}
something else, and that is [the **coexisting, overlapping, multiplicity
of institutional worlds**. Prefiguration undercuts the notion of
institutional life as a clear, zero-sum, singular plane]{.underline} (or
world). This is [not simply because partially-recognised and minor
counter-institutions exist alongside dominant ones]{.underline},
communicating, effecting and interacting with them (although this indeed
occurs). It is also because [**what [institutions]{.mark} are**
[depend]{.mark}s [on]{.mark} the [facts, legitimacy]{.mark}, roles,
authority and functions underpinning and [expressed]{.mark} by
them]{.underline}, and [[these]{.mark} different [dimensions are
frequently in dispute]{.mark}. Acts]{.underline} that are [anchored in
different normative and epistemic beliefs produce different definitions
and accounts of the acts]{.underline}. LETS, for instance, both was and
wasn't money; municipal engagement in BDS both was and wasn't
authoritative state action. [This multiplicity is more than simply
disagreement or different views about what is happening. [Since
imaginaries of]{.mark} authority, [role]{.mark}, function and
legitimacy]{.underline} (among others) [**[help make institutions
up]{.mark}**, it is also, importantly, about different
happenings]{.underline} (see also Law & Urry, 2004, p. 397).
[[Prefiguration unsettles political certainty]{.mark} when it comes to
what institutions are and what they do. While [this]{.mark} creates
risks, it also **[creates hope]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 2AC---State Good

#### Seeking political reform is key to challenge necropolitics. Refusing political engagement locks in violence and reproduces biopower.

In a compelling reminder, Edkins explains that while those events we
experience as individual or collective trauma (such as the kidnapping of
hundreds of young men and women by Boko Haram), are overwhelming, they
are also revelatory; "They reveal the contingency of the social order
and in some cases how it conceals its own impossibility" (Edkins,
2003:5)19. Therefore, we must return again to Mbembe's definition of
Politics as "death living a human life". [If Politics is 'death living a
human life"- perhaps there is nothing more optimistic than **to speak
about the end of politics**]{.underline}---that is, the "end of death
living a human life."

**[But what would emerge in its place? Still politics]{.underline}**,
but hopefully [a **reformed** **politics** that **can travel into the
future.** The word 'reform' sounds tame besides our preferred terms of
revolution and transformation but I use it advisedly in the context of
Foucault's **caution against constructing utopias that degenerate into
biopower.** **The dilemma with necropolitics is that**]{.underline} even
as we protest its putrid formations, [**we** often **lose**
**sight**]{.underline} of how much it has entwined itself around our
lives, swamped and overwhelmed our vision, language, relationships,
communities and lives. We ignore how deeply we are invested in and
complicit with its norms and enticements. So perhaps [**seeking reform**
or transformation **is a first step** to recognizing]{.underline},
unlike the local party bosses of China, [our own complicity in
corruption and in systems of power and fear.]{.underline}

Although the medical field utilizes surgical debridement to save lives
threatened by necrotic trauma, [**the only assured mode the human
species has of defeating death is ensuring that life is constantly
birthed.** So at various levels of the polity, we must continue to
mobilize, debate and seek to elect ethical, visionary and responsive
leaders; demand a national political structure rooted in true
federalism]{.underline}; and hold leaders in all societal sectors
accountable for their discourses and actions or lack thereof.

However, at an individual and collective level, [**we must also be
prepared to birth new modes of life. This is the ultimate challenge to
necropolitics.** In practical]{.underline} and basic [terms, it
translates to our genuine personal and sustained commitment to protect
human dignity]{.underline}, to fulfill our personal determination to
eradicate and alleviate poverty, provide just employment, support those
who are marginalized and in need, respond to those rendered vulnerable
in the mounting humanitarian crisis, protect the environment in trust,
deal with honesty and integrity and generate progressive social
relations rooted in the desire for justice, equity and peace. Despite
our global and national context of violence, **[we are surrounded by
numerous examples of those who deploy a politics of life to challenge
systemic necrotic decay.]{.underline}**

To highlight one example, the Stephen's Children's Home in Abeokuta is
an initiative birthed by a Nigerian committed to children who lost one
or both parents in the various eruptions of religious violence in
northern Nigeria. The residential center cares for over four hundred
displaced children who all have heartbreaking narratives of trauma, rape
and loss---they have experienced necropolitics in a manner that is
irreversible, but the courageous determination of their Nigerian
caregiving team and supporters challenges necropower in the lives of the
children more effectively than some more popular modes of engagement
that left them exposed and vulnerable to continued violence and
suffering. [This is not about mere acts of charity. It is about taking
committed steps to self-transformation and actualization, breaking free
of the paralyzing legacies of biopower and necropolitics, **creating
models and sustaining visions of the future, and re-establishing a
national framework for lasting voice and change within the citizenry and
political leadership.**]{.underline}

**Their understanding of the state as unified, immutable, and inevitably
dangerous to Indigenous actors creates a [pessimism trap]{.underline}
that [stifles]{.underline} Indigenous agency and activism.**

Indigenous Resurgence," *Pessimism in International Relations*, Chapter
9, pp 162-170, SpringerLink, dml)

**[Pessimism Trap 2: The [State is]{.mark} Unified, Deliberate and
[Unchanging in Its Desire to Dispossess]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Indigenous Peoples **[and Gain Unfettered Access to [Indigenous
Lands]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Resources **[In other words,
colonialism by settler states is a constant, not a variable, in both
outcome and intent]{.underline}**. Further, the state is not only
intentionally colonial, but it is also unifed in its desire to co-opt
Indigenous peoples as a method and means of control. In 2005's Wasase,
Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and unchanging in its
desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples noting, 'I think that
the only thing that has changed since our ancestors first declared war
on the invaders is that some of us have lost heart'.22 Referring to
current state policies as a 'self-termination movement', Alfred states,
'It is senseless to advocate for an accord with imperialism while there
is a steady and intense ongoing attack by the Settler society on
everything meaningful to us: our cultures, our communities, and our deep
attachments to land'.23 Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also
argues that the state is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite
plainly that 'it is still the objective of the Canadian and US
governments to remove Indians, or, failing that, to prevent them from
benefitting, from their ancestral territories'.24 Contemporary states do
this, he argues, not through outright violent control but 'by
insidiously promoting a form of neo-colonial self-government in our
communities and forcing our integration into the legal mainstream'.25
According to Alfred, the state 'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to
the past, and constrains the development of their societies by allowing
only those activities that support its own necessary illusion: that
indigenous peoples today do not present a serious challenge to its
legitimacy'.26 Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that
while the state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has
never changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over
time. 'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to
deny it a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the
years, 'the state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer
to it'.27 According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous
leaders and 'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood
demands to accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to
collaborate in the development of a "solution" that does not challenge
the fundamental imperial lie'.28 In a similar vein, Coulthard's central
argument is centred on his understanding of the dual structure of
colonialism. Drawing directly from Fanon, Coulthard finds that
colonialism relies on both objective and subjective elements. The
objective components involve domination through the political, economic
and legal structures of the colonial state. The subjective elements of
colonialism involve the creation of 'colonized subjects', including a
process of internalisation by which colonised subjects come to not only
accept the limited forms of 'misrecognition' granted through the state
but can even come to identify with it.29 Through this dual structure,
colonial power now works through the inclusion of Indigenous peoples,
actively shaping their perspectives in line with state discourses,
rather than merely excluding them, as in years past. Therefore, any
attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of Indigenous nationhood with state
sovereignty is still colonial insofar as it remains structurally
committed to the dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and
self-determining authority'.30 Concerning the state in relation to
Indigenous peoples on the international level, Corntassel argues that
states and global organisations, for years, have been consistently
framing Indigenous peoples' self-determination claims in ways that
'jeopardize the futures of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that
states frst compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating
lands and resources from political and legal recognition of a limited
autonomy. Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of
Indigenous peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and
legal entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With **[[this]{.mark}
move]{.underline}**, Corntassel **[[limits]{.mark} and actually demeans
Indigenous [agency, overlooking]{.mark} the [reality that
I]{.mark}ndigenous [organisations]{.mark} themselves [chose]{.mark} the
human rights framework and [rights discourse]{.mark} as a target sphere
of action precisely [because]{.mark}, as was evident in [earlier
struggles like]{.mark} slavery, [civil rights]{.mark} or women's rights,
these were tools available to them that [had]{.mark} a proven track
[record of]{.mark} opening up new possibilities and [shifting]{.mark}
previous [state positions]{.mark} and behaviour. Indigenous
[advocates]{.mark} also cleverly [realised]{.mark}]{.underline}**, by
the 1970s, **[that the [anti-discrimination and decolonisation frames
could be used together]{.mark} against states. [States]{.mark} did, [in
no way]{.mark}, nefariously [impose]{.mark} a [rights framework on
Indigenous peoples]{.mark}. Rather, Indigenous organisations and savvy
Indigenous political actors deliberately chose to frame their
self-determination struggles within the human rights framework in order
to bring states into a double bind where they could not credibly claim
to adhere to human rights and claim that they uphold equality while
simultaneously denying Indigenous peoples' human rights and leaving them
with a diminished and unequal right of
self-determination]{.underline}**. But, because he is caught in **[the
pessimism [trap of seeing]{.mark} the [state]{.mark} only [as]{.mark}
unified, deliberate and [unchanging]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Corntassel
**[[overlooks]{.mark} and diminishes the clear story of Indigenous
agency and the [potential for positive change]{.mark} in advancing
self-determination in a multitude of ways]{.underline}**. **[Pessimism
Trap 3: Engagement with the Settler State is Futile]{.underline}**,
if Not Counter-Productive **[Since the state always intends to maintain,
if not expand, colonial control]{.underline}**, and is seeking to co-opt
as many Indigenous peoples as possible in order to maintain or expand
its dispossession and control, **[it is therefore futile]{.underline}**,
at best, **[and]{.underline}** actually **[dangerous to Indigenous
existence to engage with the state]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[all
patterns of engagement will lead to co-optation as the state is cunning
and unrelenting in its desire to co-opt]{.underline}** Indigenous
leaders, academics and professionals in order to gain or maintain
control of **[Indigenous peoples]{.underline}**. Alfred argues, in both
his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous engagement with the state,
including agreements and negotiations, is not only futile but
fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not directly challenge the
existing colonial structure and 'to argue on behalf of indigenous
nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is self-defeating'.32
Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or self-government rooted in
state institutions and framed within the context of state sovereignty
can never satisfy the imperatives of Native American political
traditions'33 because the possibility for a true expression of
Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's insistence on
dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34 Worst of all,
according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame their struggles
in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but do so within a
state framework, rather than resisting the state itself, it 'represents
the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate indigenous
peoples'.35 Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous
self-determination through any sort of engagement with the state,
Coulthard also advocates for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that
follows both his mentor Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist
theorist Leanne Simpson.36 As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson
start from a position that calls on Indigenous peoples and communities
to "turn away" from the assimilative reformism of the liberal
recognition approach and to instead build our national liberation
efforts on the revitalization of "traditional" political values and
practices'.37 Drawing upon the prescriptive approach of these theorists,
Coulthard proposes, in his concluding chapter, five theses from his
analysis that are intended to build and solidify Indigenous resurgence
into the future: 1. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that
physical forms of Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are
very important not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means
of protecting the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples'
existence; 2. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist
forms of economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of
land-based Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches; 3.
Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the need
for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated systems
of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences in both
urban and land-based settings'38; 4. Gender Justice and Decolonisation,
meaning that decolonisation must also include a shift away from
patriarchy and an embrace of gender relations that are non-violent and
refective of the centrality of women in traditional forms of Indigenous
governance and society; and 5. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard
denies that he advocates complete rejection of engagement with the
state's political and legal system, he does assert that 'our efforts to
engage these discursive and institutional spaces to secure recognition
of our rights have not only failed, but have instead served to subtly
reproduce the forms of racist, sexist, economic, and political
confgurations of power that we initially sought...to challenge'.39 He
therefore advocates expressly for 'critical self-refection, skepticism,
and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of recognition that seeks to
practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and economically
nonexploitative alternative structures of law and sovereign authority
grounded on a critical refashioning of the best of Indigenous legal and
political traditions'.40 Corntassel also demonstrates the third
pessimism trap, that all engagement with the state is ultimately futile.
For the most part, however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN
system operates like a reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and
'channels the energies of transnational Indigenous networks into the
institutional fiefdoms of member countries', by which an 'illusion of
inclusion' is created.41 He argues that, in order to be included or
their views listened to, Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the
strategies, language, norms and modes of behaviour of member states and
international institutions. Corntassel fnds that 'what results is a
cadre of professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more
allegiance to the UN system than to their own communities'.42 In his
final analysis, he charges that the co-optation of international
Indigenous political actors is highly 'effective in challenging the
unity of the global Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine
dialogue regarding Indigenous self-determination and justice'.43 Finding
that states deliberately co-opt and provide 'illusions of inclusion' to
Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel comes to the same
conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of engagement, arguing that
because transnational Indigenous networks are 'channeled' and 'blunted'
by colonial state actors, 'it is a critical time for Indigenous peoples
to rethink their approaches to bringing Indigenous rights concerns to
global forums'.44 Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic
'Resurgence' Versus the Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on
the Ground **[All of these]{.underline}** writers **[advocate Indigenous
resurgence, through a combination of rejecting]{.underline}** the
current reconciliation politics of **[settler colonial states, coupled
with a return to land-based Indigenous expressions of governance as the
only viable, 'authentic' and legitimate path to a better future for
Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
decolonisation]{.underline}**. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities. As I
have pointed out here, however, **[all]{.underline}** three theorists
**[are]{.underline}** also **[caught in the]{.underline}** same three
**[pessimism traps: authenticity versus co-option; a vision of the state
as unified, deliberate and never changing in its desire to colonise and
control; and a view of engagement with the state as futile, if not
dangerous, to Indigenous sovereignty and existence]{.underline}**. When
combined, **[these]{.underline}** three pessimism
**[traps]{.underline}** aim to **[[inhibit Indigenous peoples'
engagement with]{.mark} the state in [any process that could]{.mark}
potentially [re-imagine]{.mark} and re-formulate their [current
relations]{.mark}hip into one that could be transformative and
post-colonial, [as envisioned by]{.mark} the UN [Declaration on]{.mark}
the [Rights of Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}. The]{.underline}** pessimism
**[traps]{.underline}** together work to **[foreclose any possibility
that there could be credible openings of opportunity to negotiate a
fairer and just relationship of co-existence with even the most
progressive state government. This]{.underline}** pessimistic approach
**[is not innocuous. By overemphasising structure and granting the state
an enormous degree of agency as a unitary actor, this]{.underline}**
pessimistic approach **[does a remarkable disservice to Indigenous
resistance movements by proscribing, from academia, an extremely narrow
view of what Indigenous self-determination can and should mean in
practice. [By]{.mark} overlooking and/or [discounting]{.mark} Indigenous
[agency]{.mark} and not even considering the possibility that Indigenous
peoples could themselves be calculating, strategic political actors in
their own right, and vis-à-vis states, [the]{.mark} pessimistic
[lens]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the resurgence school **[unnecessarily,
unproductively and [unjustly limits]{.mark} the field of [possibility
for Indigenous people]{.mark}s' decision-making, [thus]{.mark} actually
countering and [inhibiting]{.mark} expressions of Indigenous
[self-determination]{.mark}. By condemning---writ large---all Indigenous
peoples and organisations that wish to seek peaceful co-existence with
the state, negotiate mutually beneficial agreements with the state,
and/or who have advocated on the international level for]{.underline}**
a set of **[standards]{.underline}** that can provide a positive guiding
framework **[for Indigenous-state relations, the pessimistic
lens]{.underline}** of resurgence **[forecloses much potential for new
and improved relations, in any form, and is very likely to lead to
deeper conflicts between states and Indigenous peoples, and potentially,
even violent action]{.underline}**, which Fanon indicated was the
necessary outcome. **[The pessimism traps]{.underline}** of the
resurgence school **[are therefore]{.underline}**, likely
**[self-defeating for all but the most remote and isolated Indigenous
communities]{.underline}**. Further, **[this approach is quite out of
step with the actions and vision of many Indigenous resistance movements
on the ground who have been working for decades to advance Indigenous
self-determination, both domestically and globally, in ways that
transform the colonial state into something more just and may eventually
present creative alternatives to the Westphalian state form in ways that
could respect and accommodate Indigenous nations]{.underline}**. Rather,
**[it aims to shame and blame those who wish to explore creative and
innovative post-colonial resolutions to the colonial
condition]{.underline}**. **[The [UN Declaration]{.mark}]{.underline}**
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the Declaration or UN Declaration)
was adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 after 25 years of
development. The Declaration **[[is ground-breaking, given]{.mark} the
[key]{.mark} leadership [roles Indigenous peoples played in
negotiating]{.mark} and achieving this
[agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}**.45 Additionally, for the first time in
UN history, the rights holders, **[Indigenous [peoples, worked with
states to develop]{.mark} an [instrument that would]{.mark} serve to
promote, [protect]{.mark} and affirm Indigenous [rights]{.mark}, both
globally and in individual domestic contexts.]{.underline}**46 **[Many
Indigenous [organisations]{.mark} and movements, [from dozens of
countries]{.mark} around the world, [were involved]{.mark} in drafting
and negotiating the UN Declaration and are now advocating for its full
implementation, both internationally and in domestic and regional
contexts]{.underline}**. In Canada, some of the key organisational
players---the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), the Assembly
of First Nations, and the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, or
their predecessor organisations---were involved in the drafting and
lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration during the 1980s, 1990s and
2000s. In the United States, organisations like the American Indian Law
Alliance and the Native American Rights Fund have been involved as well
as the Navajo Nation and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who represent
themselves as Indigenous peoples' governing institutions. From
Scandinavia, the Saami Council and the Sami Parliaments all play a key
role in advancing Indigenous rights. In Latin America, organisations
like the Confederación de Nationalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE)
and the Consejo Indio de Sud America (CISA) advocate for implementation
of the UN Declaration. The three, **[major transnational Indigenous
organisations]{.underline}**--- the World Council of Indigenous Peoples,
the International Indian Treaty Council and the Inuit Circumpolar
Council---**[were all key members of the drafting and negotiating team
for the UN Declaration, and]{.underline}** the latter two, which are
still in existence, **[continue their strong advocacy for its full
implementation]{.underline}**. Implementation of the UN Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires fundamental and significant
change, on both the international and domestic levels. Because
implementation of Indigenous rights essentially calls for a complete and
fundamental restructuring of Indigenous-state relationships, it expects
states to enact and implement a signifcant body of legal,
constitutional, legislative and policy changes that can accommodate such
things as Indigenous land rights, free, prior and informed consent,
redress and a variety of self-government, autonomy and other such
arrangements. **[[States are not going to implement]{.mark} this
multifaceted and [complex]{.mark} set of [changes on their
own]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however. **[[They]{.mark} will
[require]{.mark} significant political and moral [pressure]{.mark} to
hold them accountable to the rhetorical commitments they have made to
support this level of change. They will also require ongoing
conversation and negotiation with Indigenous peoples along the way, lest
the process becomes problematically one-sided. Such processes ultimately
require sustained political will, commitment and engagement over the
long term, to reach]{.underline}** the end result of **[radical systemic
change and Indigenous state relationships grounded in mutual respect,
co-existence and reciprocity. This type of fundamental [change
requires]{.mark} creative thinking, careful diplomacy, tenacity,
and]{.underline}** above all, **[[optimistic vision]{.mark}, on the part
of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}**. The **[[pessimistic
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the resurgence school
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** ultimately **[[of little
use]{.underline}]{.mark}** in these efforts, **[other than as a
cautionary tale against state power, of which the organisational players
are already keenly aware]{.underline}**. Further, by **[dismissing and
discouraging all efforts at engagement with states, and]{.underline}**
especially with **[the blanket accusations that all who engage in such
efforts are 'co-opted' and not 'authentically'
Indigenous]{.underline}**, the resurgence school **[actually creates
unnecessary negative feelings and divisions amongst Indigenous movements
who should be pooling limited resources and working together towards
better futures]{.underline}**.

#### The state is a [process]{.underline} that must be [continually engaged]{.underline} in addition to working outside of it. Violence does not [inhere]{.underline} in the state, BUT [abandoning]{.underline} the state cedes it to conservative capture and means the alt cannot [scale]{.underline} to [governance]{.underline} problems associated with ecological justice.

The prospects for EJ through the state

Additionally, these recent critical assessments raise serious doubts
about whether EJ movements should engage with the state to help redress
environmental injustice. They do so in part by specifying how states'
responses to EJ movements have been deeply disappointing, entailing
small concessions that fall short of, coopt, and neuter activists'
demands. For instance, [[Pulido]{.underline}]{.mark} and colleagues
[[list]{.mark} the [failures of]{.mark} "key avenues in which
[EJ]{.mark} activists have sought [relief from the
state]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Pulido, 2017a: 525): filing lawsuits
against government agencies for violations of the Equal Protection
clause of the U.S. Constitution's 14th amendment, filing administrative
complaints against agencies for violating Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act, advising agencies on how to implement EO 12898, and pressuring
agencies to enforce environmental law more stringently in overburdened
communities (see also Pulido, 2016, 2018; Pulido et al., 2016).
Similarly, Pellow argues that EJ movements have been "ultimately
achieving relatively little by way of state changes," noting the U.S.
EPA's minimal progress on implementing EO 12898 and how few remedies
overburdened and marginalized communities have received through the
legal system. These regulatory shortcomings certainly warrant
condemnation, and other scholars have rightly criticized agencies' EJ
policy implementation efforts for insufficiently redressing
environmental injustice (Harrison, 2019; Holifield, 2004, 2012; Konisky,
2015; Liévanos, 2012; London et al., 2008; Shilling et al., 2009).

Yet their critiques of the state are not limited to specific failures
but are more expansive and rooted in critical theories of the state.
[Drawing on]{.underline} recent [scholarship on racial capitalism,
settler colonialism, enslavement, and carcerality]{.underline} that
provide crucial counterpoints to pluralist, uncritical treatments of the
state, [they argue that states produce racial hierarchies, environmental
inequalities, and other forms of ideological and material violence in
the service of capital accumulation and colonial
dispossession]{.underline}.2 Citing seminal work on racial capitalism by
Cedric Robinson and subsequent engagements with it by Ruth Wilson
Gilmore (2002) and others, Pulido (2016) explains that the "devaluation
of Black (and other nonwhite) bodies has been a central feature of
global capitalism for centuries (Robinson, 2000) and creates a landscape
of differential value which can be harnessed in diverse ways to
facilitate the accumulation of more power and profit than would
otherwise be possible" (1). Moreover, the state "refuses to implement
meaningful initiatives" to support EJ because environmental inequality
is inherent to and central to the state's role in fostering capitalism:
"environmental racism is constituent of racial capitalism" (Pulido,
2017a: 529, 524). "The state is not about to dismantle this 'ecological
service' that allows firms to remain competitive in the global
marketplace" (Pulido, 2017a: 529).

Pellow (2014, 2016, 2018, 2021) and Kojola and Pellow (2021) also draw
on critical race theory, as well as scholarship from anarchist studies,
intersectional feminism, and other fields, to argue that environmental
inequalities are not accidental aberrations but one of the many forms of
hierarchy that the state necessarily creates and maintains through
violence to foster capital accumulation and control. [[Pellow
argues]{.mark} that]{.underline} these [forms of [violence "are
foundational to]{.mark}]{.underline} the formation and [[maintenance of
states]{.underline}]{.mark} and capital and that therefore it would
likely be counterproductive for environmental justice scholars and
advocates to seek solutions from dominant institutions"---that we should
not "expect the very institutions that are largely driving
socioecological inequalities to offer remedies for these harms" (2018:
151).

Pellow, Pulido, and colleagues have played leading roles in bringing
critical social theory into EJ studies in ways that push the field in
important new directions. They emphasize that capitalism does not only
produce racial inequality but actually relies on it, that the state
actively and foundationally creates and fosters racial hierarchies, and
that those hierarchies of value are not accidental but instead are a
productive, central part of the functioning of capitalism. Their
scholarship serves as crucial correctives to much environmental
inequality research that treats race simply as a demographic variable
and as functioning independently of the state and the market. Pulido's
work in particular details how racial systems have changed over time in
response to social movement challenges and in ways that naturalize and
otherwise shore up the status quo. Moreover, this scholarship, and
subsequent studies it has helped inform and inspire, document a vast
array of ways that state institutions participate in these processes.
Pellow's work is especially powerful in this regard, as he connects a
wide array of examples, some not usually seen as "environmental," to
show how pervasively the state constructs and reinforces status
hierarchies through violence and that this violence takes many
intersecting forms (including racism, classism, anthropocentrism,
sexism, ableism, etc.).

These publications counsel EJ scholars and activists to not just
decenter the state but turn away from it, arguing that engaging with the
state is counterproductive and perpetuates injustice. Pellow emphasizes
that much can be gained through practicing direct democracy without
waiting for the state or playing by the rules it sets. He offers brief
examples of activists collectively pursuing more just worlds beyond the
state: grassroots, horizontally organized groups providing food and
shelter, cleaning up contaminated sites, and engaging in other mutual
aid (2018: 25). Pellow acknowledges that such enactments of direct
democracy are prone to the oppression and domination that pervade
broader society. Hence, he challenges EJ scholars and activists to
interrogate how hierarchies of value---including white supremacy,
patriarchy, cis-heteronormativity, and speciesism, and, crucially, their
intersections---manifest within spaces of not only mainstream but also
radical environmental politics (Pellow, 2014, 2018).

Like Pellow, Pulido and de Lara (2018) argue for pursuing change beyond
the state. [They advocate for EJ scholars and activists to build and
foster different kinds of relationships]{.underline}, consciousness,
forms of political mobilization, and ways of being that enable us to
imagine a "form of freedom that does not revert to nation-bound
definitions of peoplehood and nature" and are not embedded within "the
same racial and capitalist relationships of power that produced the
colonial project of plunder and dispossession in the Americas" (Pulido
and de Lara, 2018: 78).

To be sure, their recommendations entail some complexity. Notably,
Pulido and colleagues emphasize that EJ activists and scholars must
expect the state to serve capital accumulation, not justice, and thus
must approach the state through confrontation. For instance, Pulido
argues that "EJ activists and researchers should view the state as a
site of contestation, rather than as an ally or neutral force" (2017a:
524) and should be "seeing the state as an adversary that must be
confronted in a manner similar to industry" (530). Pulido et al. (2016)
argue that EJ movements should be "challenging capitalism or the state's
efforts to protect it" (15), "refusing to participate in regulatory
charades," "oppositional," "challenging the state," and "raising hell
for both polluters and agencies that protect them" (15, 26, 27). Pellow
occasionally offers tempered acknowledgments that engaging with the
state can be part of a productive EJ movement strategy (2018: 14, 24,
52, 151).

However, notwithstanding these complexities within and across their
publications, Pellow, [Pulido, and colleagues are also so dismissive of
the state that it is unclear how even confronting the state would be
anything but futile]{.underline}. Notably, Pulido et al. (2016) insist
through the very end of the article that the state refuses to and/or is
unable to enforce existing laws precisely because "vulnerable
communities, in this case, communities of color, are essential to the
functioning of racial capitalism" and marvel that EJ activists "seem to
believe that the state will actually protect them" (26). Pellow's
writing conveys that engaging with the state is not only futile but
perpetuates injustice. Despite occasionally conceding that, for
instance, "\[s\]ocial movements can strategically harness the power of
states to produce positive outcomes" (2018: 151), such comments are
overshadowed by his insistence that any engagement with the state
legitimizes its inherent violence. Pellow bases this argument on the
state's longstanding history of violence against people of color and
other marginalized groups, as well as his assertion that states'
"pro-socioecological" functions ("ecological protection, environmental
justice, \[and\] civil and human rights") and its "antisocioecological"
functions "tend to be integrally linked in a fashion that serves to
reinforce state power and various forms of inequality" (Pellow, 2018:
23, 57). He argues, "repression and violence are not practices that
states engage in on an occasional basis; they are at the core of what
states do and why they exist \... They are \... inherently authoritarian
and exclusionary forces" (2018: 57--58). As a result, he insists that EJ
movements should pursue change "beyond the state" because anything else
legitimizes these fundamentally violent institutions. His
recommendations align with a broader body of anarchist-inspired
(autonomist) Marxist scholarship that conceptualizes the state as
anathema to justice (see Angel, 2017: 559--560). Pellow writes, "EJ
scholars and activists would be well served by always considering the
pros and cons of embracing the state, and asking how their conceptual
and tactical choices could instead be focused on the most robustly
democratic options" (2018: 24). He implores EJ scholars and activists to
"go beyond the state to find other sources of such support that deepen
and improve the health of our relationships among one another and with
our ecological life support systems" (2021: 60--61).

Within, against, and beyond the state

The arguments by Pellow, Pulido, and colleagues about EJ activists' and
scholars' priorities described above draw important attention to the
state's structural perpetuation of violence and its targeting of the
bodies, families, communities, and lands of Indigenous peoples, people
of color, and other groups. By situating the specifics of EJ policy
implementation into broad historical, structural context, these scholars
compellingly argue that EJ movements need to stridently challenge state
institutions and foster direct democracy beyond the state. That said, I
argue that, despite the complexities of their arguments, they represent
the state as inevitably and fully serving the interests of capital
through racial capitalism and settler colonialism, and that doing so
leads them to problematic recommendations that dismiss the ways in which
states also serve other ends, can be made to do so more meaningfully,
must be made to do so, and are being made to do so.

Notwithstanding the state's many failures to date, government agencies'
modest responses to EJ and other environmental movements nonetheless
have material benefits for communities who cannot otherwise escape from
environmental hazards (Harrison, 2019; Holifield, 2018; King, 2012;
Méndez, 2020; Wilson et al., 2007). The state enacts and facilitates
dispossession, exploitation, and other forms of violence, but also
health clinics, roads, and schools. Its policing apparatus includes
racist surveillance, apprehension, and detention systems, but also
environmental law enforcement that limits air and water pollution. As
countless studies have shown, such institutions and protections are
highly unevenly extended and otherwise insufficient and problematic. But
a critical attention to the workings of state power need not preclude
inquiry into the ways state institutions help reduce harm and meet other
requirements of justice and can be made to do so more meaningfully.

In recent years, [[political ecologists]{.mark} and other geographers
have [marshaled **relational conceptions** **of the state** to challenge
scholarship]{.mark} [that treats the state as **monolithic**]{.mark},
**[ontologically coherent]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[rigid]{.mark}, [and
entirely repressive]{.mark}]{.underline} (Angel, 2017; Angel and Loftus,
2019; Bakker, 2007; Carroll, 2015; Loftus, 2020; Martin and Pierce,
2012; Robertson, 2010; Routledge et al., 2018; Thelen et al., 2014;
Wright, 2010). [These scholars critique structuralist accounts that
focus exclusively on the coercive functions of the state]{.underline},
calling for greater attention to the variegations, contradictions, and
inconsistencies in state practice. As Davina Cooper (2017: 337--338)
describes,

[Alongside those who see the only "good" states as]{.underline} workers'
states, or states in the process of "[withering away," are
[those]{.mark} who [find transformative potential]{.mark} even
[in]{.mark} the depths of [liberal capitalist states]{.mark} as [they
**uncover contradictions**]{.mark}, [inconsistencies and **plurality in
state systems**]{.mark}, **[logics, actors and
rationalities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Chappell, 2000; Martin and
Pierce, 2012; Newman, 2012; Newman and Clarke, 2014). [[Capitalist
liberal states]{.underline}]{.mark} may reproduce dominant social
relations and benefit elites but they [also [provide]{.mark} social
[welfare]{.mark}, steward resources, establish [fora for]{.mark} public
[debate]{.mark}, make new critical forms of knowledge
possible]{.underline} and, to some limited degree, protect populations,
including more vulnerable and precarious populations, from civil
society's violence and discriminations. Progressive state activities and
effects vary by time and place, are routinely compromised, more promised
in rhetoric than practice and, in their fragility, typically defeated by
more powerful state agendas. Progressive actions may also be unofficial,
or initiated by subordinate state actors drawing on residual or
unintended resources. But for engagement-positive writers and activists,
[the [potential (**at least**) for states to]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} a
[productive terrain]{.mark} [where progressive politics]{.mark} can
[happen]{.mark}, [given not everything can be]{.mark} organised and
resolved through [outside-the-state]{.mark}, [micro-scaled
grass-roots]{.mark} decision-making, [remains **vitally
important**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Scholars call for relational and processual theorizations that treat
state institutions as reflecting broader social contestation within
which they are embedded (e.g. Jessop, 2002). As Paul Routledge, Andrew
Cumbers, and Kate Derickson (2018) argue, "[To understand [the **state
as a process**]{.mark} is to [recognize]{.mark} that [it is
constantly]{.mark} being [reworked]{.mark} and remade in ways that shift
the balance of power across institutions and scales]{.underline} with
evolving implications for justice-oriented political responses \... By
viewing the state in terms of an ensemble of institutional structures
and practices, through which particular social groups attempt to develop
their own politics and strategies, we can be attentive to the openings
for progressive political mobilisations" (79, 80). That is,
conceptualizing states as shaped by and reflective of struggle and
contestation positions them as able to be remade. [Rather than reducing
[the state]{.mark} to inherently, inevitably, and wholly oppressive, it
[is better understood as]{.mark} a **[terrain of
struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline} and thus a complex patchwork of
practices that cut in multiple directions. Moreover, [[it is]{.mark}
also [a **necessary site**]{.mark} **of struggle** both [because it is a
**source of harms**]{.mark} [and a **site for** ]{.mark}**helping [to
redress them]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Pauline McGuirk and Phillip O'Neill (2012: 1377--1378) explain that
recognizing the functional and relational complexity within
states---viewing them as peopled sites of contestation---highlights
opportunities for political change:

While they \[states\] can appear as actors with a more-than-provisional
identity and coherency, such subjectivity belies their existence as
fields of multi-vocal and multi-scalar, cross-cutting and conflicting
interests \... \[[States are\] resolutely hybrid and multilayered,
resistant to a common, singular rationality, driven by diverse
ideologies]{.underline}, and holding on to multiple political projects
and motivations mobilised simultaneously \... States are always in play,
then, but are subject to reconstruction by the changing discourses,
technologies and practices of governing \... Notwithstanding
neoliberalism's reworking of states' operations, then, state capacity
for progressive social and redistributive interventions remains; and the
practices, technologies and texts which mobilise progressive
interventions are always available to be amplified.

Malini Ranganathan (2016) urges EJ scholars to specify how states
produce and reproduce racist orders and also how they can be used and
reformed toward more environmentally just ends---to identify ways in
which "liberalism's contradictions and ambivalences provide openings for
counter-hegemonic struggle": "[[radical EJ]{.mark} movements [could be
deepened]{.mark} via an [explicit **unmasking of racial
liberalism**]{.mark} **[while]{.mark} also accepting** and
**[strengthening]{.mark} [liberalism's potential]{.mark}** [for
**fighting**]{.mark} **structural [environmental
discrimination]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (29--30).

In their arguments about what EJ activists and scholars do and should
do, Pellow, Pulido, and colleagues dismiss this complexity of states,
instead conceptualizing them as wholly repressive. This leads them to
problematic conclusions. First, Pellow's wholesale condemnation of the
state and constant embrace of scholarship that regards states as
"inherently authoritarian and exclusionary" (58) leaves him emphasizing
that EJ movements should turn away from the state and pursue justice
beyond it. However, [**[turning]{.mark} away [from the state]{.mark}**
[leaves the state **open to**]{.mark} **[further capture by
industry]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **fuels [neoliberal rollback]{.mark}**
[that exacerbates]{.mark} environmental [injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Faber, 2008; Harrison, 2011; Harvey, 2013; Mascarenhas, 2012). Also,
[turning away from the state leaves intact its structures of
dispossession and violence]{.underline}. Hence the importance of social
movements that challenge the state, including prison abolitionist
movements that engage the state not necessarily as a source of justice
but to reduce some harm it causes (Gilmore, 2017).

Additionally, Pellow's [[examples]{.mark} [of **direct
democracy**]{.mark} [are **very brief and highly
localized**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} leaving the reader wondering [[how
direct democracy can provide]{.mark} what EJ requires at the
[**necessary** **spatial and temporal scales**]{.mark}, [such as
restricting **pollution**]{.mark} from industry; [building]{.mark} and
maintaining **[infrastructures]{.mark}** [like]{.mark} bridges, roads,
and municipal [water treatment facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[and
leveraging taxes]{.mark} to fund such initiatives]{.underline}.
[[Struggles]{.mark} for justice [through the state]{.mark} have
[helped]{.mark} [force]{.mark} the [creation of public
**services**]{.mark} [and protections from]{.mark} the exploitative and
[hazardous practices of capital]{.mark} in ways other actors cannot
accomplish.]{.underline} To be sure, these have been grossly inadequate
and unevenly extended. Yet these [public institutions provide important
benefits which must be strengthened--- including in ways that expand
(certain forms of) state power]{.underline}---[rather than
abandoned]{.underline}, and which [**cannot be left** to the **uneven**
and **fluctuating abilities and interests of volunteers**]{.underline}.

#### Saying that the state is always bad is a [terrible misreading]{.underline} of Foucault. Rejecting the state in a [totalizing way]{.underline} means the aff [links to itself]{.underline} since they turn [difference]{.underline} into [opposition]{.underline}. Piecemeal reform is important and you should affirm it\-\--creativity with [democratic politics]{.underline} solves.

**Patton, '05** (Paul Patton, *Deleuze and Democracy*, Contemporary
Political Theory,
http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cpt/journal/v4/n4/full/9300236a.html)

[[Mengue turns]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[difference into opposition in
suggesting]{.underline}]{.mark} that the position of majority is by
nature opposed to the creativity of the minoritarian: [[majoritarian
democratic politics inevitably \'crush]{.underline}]{.mark}es\'
[[creative becomings]{.underline}]{.mark} (Mengue, 2003, 102). According
to this view, to adopt the standpoint of the majority is always to
abandon the standpoint of the untimely and the creative in favour of the
state and established values. [[This is a **misrepresentation**
of]{.mark} Deleuze and Guattari\'s view and an implausible view of
[democratic politics. Legislative measures introduced in]{.mark} a
number of [democracies]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years [[have
served to broaden the standard to include non-whites, non-males
and]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[to allow equal rights to homosexual
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These measures suggest
that]{.underline}, [far from \'crushing novelty\']{.underline} as Mengue
suggests, **[[democratic politics can have its own forms of
creativity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. No doubt [such measures have been
implemented in response to micropolitical changes already
underway]{.underline}. For this reason, William Connolly reminds us that
in order to be responsive to new claims for the reconfiguration of the
standard [[democratic political life needs to be infused with a public
ethos of critical engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} (Connolly, 1999, 51).
For Deleuze and Guattari, the different forms of minority becoming
provide the impulse for change at the level of social and political
institutions, but [[this]{.mark} change [only occurs to the extent that
there is **adaptation and incorporation** on the side of the
majority]{.mark}]{.underline}. [When they say that the power of
minorities \'is not measured by their capacity to enter into and make
themselves felt within the majority system, nor even to reverse the
necessarily tautological criterion of the majority\', they mean that the
[majorities do not determine the limits of]{.mark} the potential for
[transformation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987, 471).
They do not mean to suggest that minorities do not enter into and
produce effects upon the majority. On the contrary[,]{.mark} **[[they
insist upon the importance of piecemeal changes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to the form and content of a given majority: [[\'molecular escapes and
movements would be nothing if they did not return to the molar
organizations to reshuffle their segments]{.mark}, their binary
distributions of sexes, classes and parties\']{.underline} (Deleuze and
Guattari, 1987, 216--217).6 Deleuze and Guattari\'s insistence on the
transformative potential of minoritarian becomings does not imply a
refusal of democratic politics, much less a rejection of democratic
principles. The irreducible character of the difference in kind between
majority and minority aligns them firmly with the proponents of
democratic pluralism such as Connolly, for whom the key to an open-ended
democratic process lies in the \'productive tension\' between
majoritarian governance, rights and recognition on the one hand, and
minoritarian becoming on the other (Connolly, 2002, 172). For Deleuze
and Guattari, [it is precisely those excluded from the majority as
defined by a given set of axioms who are the potential bearers of the
power to transform that set]{.underline}, whether in the direction of a
new set of axioms or an altogether new axiomatic. [These are the source
of minoritarian becomings that carry the potential for new earths and
peoples unlike like those found in existing democracies]{.underline}.

#### The state is [inevitable]{.underline}, but [NOT]{.underline} monolithic. "Refusal" in practice become refusal to do [anything]{.underline} that could ever make the world [better]{.underline} for the survivors of necro politics.

**Passavant, 07** \[The Contradictory State of Giorgio Agamben, Paul,
Associate Professor of Political Science Ph.D., Wisconsin at Madison
M.A., Wisconsin at Madison B.A., Michigan, p. Sage Publications\]

I have argued that [Agamben has two competing theories]{.underline} [of
the state]{.underline} in play within his work. [His first
theory]{.underline} of the state [posits the state in a
determined]{.underline} [relation to the economy.]{.underline} From this
position, he can more easily describe political change as the economic
forces determining the state bear within them the seeds of the coming
community. This is a theory, however, that disguises its reliance on a
form of power to secure the conditions of possibility for a common
relation to communicability, and he does not address the consequences of
the possible weakening of that form of power---the globalization of
spectacular capital---for the commonality that it enabled. If
spectacular capital should weaken, on one hand, or if it produces not
commonality but polarities, on the other, then presumably the
commonality that it theoretically enabled would either wane with the
weakening of this power formation or simply not exist. [Agamben's second
theory of the state posits the state as a determining force over human
life.]{.underline} Agamben establishes the state in this determining
position by borrowing from Schmitt's theory of sovereign decisionism.
Yet, [in so doing, [he erects a]{.mark} theoretical [roadblock
preventing passage to the coming community]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Although [I have suggested that he hasn's conceived of
three]{.underline} possible [ways whereby subjects might decide to act
to render this]{.underline} [state power inoperative]{.underline} or
perform actions enabling the suspension of sovereign law and messianic
passage beyond this sovereign state, [[each of these three forms]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} political [subjectivity fails to do the]{.mark} theoretical
[work demanded of it]{.mark}]{.underline}. Bartleby's manifestation of a
pure potentiality might render inoperative modern state government as
Foucault has described it by disrupting the linkages among the series of
institutions and subjects that the modern state relies upon to govern,
but it is unclear how Bartleby would affect the Schmittian unitary
sovereign decision maker upon which Agamben bases his theory of the
state in Homo Sacer. Agamben also points to anomic 168 Political Theory
Downloaded from ptx.sagepub.com at UNIV OF MICHIGAN on July 4, 2013
carnivals to suggest that states of emergency can become something more,
and his theory of the gesture might contribute to a description of how a
carnival might become something politically revolutionary. This would
require, however, forcing the gesture into a relation of transcendence
with regard to carnivalesque performances---an unacceptable move for a
theory that embraces immanence to the extent that Agamben does. It also
misrepresents why the carnivalesque harbors emancipatory political
potential within it. Finally, Agamben indicates, through the example of
the apostle Paul and the remnant of those who faithfully adhere to
messianic law, the possibility of active political subjects adequate to
the challenge of state sovereignty. This argument, however, contradicts
his earlier positions embracing potentiality over the acts emblematic of
sovereign decisions, and an experience of being beyond any idea of law.
It also, by relying on a determinate situation to create the conditions
of possibility for a successful speech act, occludes the forms of power
needed to maintain this situation against other ontological
possibilities much as his first theory of passage beyond the state of
integrated spectacle did. This argument also begs the question of how
this messianic community might relate to that which remains other to its
situation. That is, [Agamben must address the very questions that his
ontological approach to state sovereignty intended to
avoid]{.underline}--- [questions of power and otherness]{.underline}.
[In sum, Agamben remains haunted by the very problems that motivated not
only his critique of the state but also his attempt to remove this
inquiry from political philosophy to "first" philosophy.]{.underline} 43
[At the end of Agamben's theory of the state, politics
remains]{.underline}. [There are four implications]{.underline} of this
critique for political theory and the state. [First, [the]{.mark} modern
[state is poorly understood]{.mark}]{.underline} as transcendent,
unitary, and sovereign. [[The "state" encompasses a variety of
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, many of which predate modernity.44
The Foucauldian understanding of government, I suggested, is the
practice by which articulations between these institutions are
forged---and non-state institutions are joined to this chain---and they
are mobilized toward various purposes. The plural nature of this
ensemble is precisely what gives extension to the modern state.45
[Second, [if we treat the state as an ensemble]{.mark} [of institutions,
then the concept of a state of emergency is poorly suited to
understanding our]{.mark} political [present]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Agamben rightly criticizes the]{.underline} USA [PATRIOT
Act]{.underline} in State of Exception. [This law]{.underline}, [like
most laws]{.underline} that are passed in an ongoing legal system,
[amends a variety of other laws and sits on a foundation created
by]{.underline} [these other laws]{.underline}, such as the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The Antiterrorism
Act created the possibility of attributing guilt by association since it
criminalized the provision of material support for Passavant / The
Contradictory State of Giorgio Agamben 169 Downloaded from
ptx.sagepub.com at UNIV OF MICHIGAN on July 4, 2013 organizations that
the administration deems "terrorist"---provisions that the USA PATRIOT
Act builds upon.46 From this perspective, [[current policies are less
"exceptional]{.mark},"]{.underline} [unfortunately, and more a
continuing development of a national security state apparatus that has
been built through legislation]{.underline} like the National Security
Act of 1947, through discourse, and through the creation of stakeholders
(the military-industrial complex).47 [In other words, another state
formation is struggling to emerge through the ruin of liberal democracy
in the United States, and this emergence]{.underline} (and ruin) [is
hastened by those who seek to enhance]{.underline} surveillance and
[presidential powers, while diminishing the power of courts and
legislative oversight as a response to September 11]{.underline},
2001.48 [Third, any social formation is constituted by elements of both
contingency and determination. By emphasizing pure potentiality, Agamben
misses this and either cherishes the excessive quality of pure
potentiality to the neglect of the exigent needs of the present, or
neglects how the active political subjects he does defend are embedded
within finite commitments that necessarily persevere through the
foreclosure of other possibilities.]{.underline} Some contemporary
political theorists concerned with injustice and the lack of democracy
also emphasize contingency, excess, and potentiality over determination,
finitude, and acts.49 These [theorists correctly seek to disrupt
oppressive pattern]{.underline}s. [[Since]{.mark} politics---hence
[political change]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[would]{.underline} [not be
possible under conditions of absolute
determination]{.underline}]{.mark}, [emphasizing]{.underline}
[contingency or excess makes sense. Yet]{.underline} reflection upon the
retraction of certain state services from places like the Bronx during
the late 1970s permits us to see how neither justice nor democracy is
served by excessive economic duress or violence. Not only are these
contingencies unjust, but also their incapacitating effects prevent
democratic practices of government where the latter necessarily
presupposes some collective capacity to direct and achieve collective
purposes. [[State actions that mitigate]{.mark}]{.underline} chaos,
economic inequality, and [[violence]{.underline}]{.mark}, then,
[potentially [contribute to the improved justice of outcomes and
democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Political theorists must temper
celebrating contingency with a simultaneous consideration of the
complicated relation that determination has to democratic purposes.50
[Fourth[, the state's institutions are among the few with the capacity
to respond to]{.mark} the exigency of [human needs]{.mark} identified by
political theorists. [These actions will]{.mark} necessarily
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} finite and [[less than]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2AC---Progress Possible

#### Quality of life for arctic indigenous people has risen; disproves necropolitics -- prefer statistics.

[The livelihood and living conditions of the indigenous peoples of the
Arctic have changed rapidly since World War II]{.underline}---the period
in history that has seen the largest immigration of newcomers.
Characterizing the development of the changes in the Arctic as "rapid"
is not a cliché. [**The indigenous peoples have**, generally speaking,
**proven to be both resilient and adaptive despite hardships** due to
injustices arising from a lack of social and cultural empathy from
colonial powers]{.underline}. In many regions, and through the different
arrangements they negotiated with the states they found themselves to be
citizens of, [indigenous peoples have managed largely to maintain
critically important aspects of their lifestyles, including close
relations to nature through subsistence use of the land water and their
living resources.]{.underline} Many indigenous peoples have also
succeeded in retaining their ancestral languages.

The indigenous people make up roughly 10 % of the total Arctic
population. A majority of the Arctic population are, from a historical
perspective, newcomers. All Arctic regions depend on exploitation of
natural resources (renewable and/ or nonrenewable), and all are impacted
by globalization and climate change. These impacts have resulted in
multifaceted challenges because the changes are intertwined with
demographic, socioeconomic, and sociocultural changes.

A key question, therefore, is how the changes have impacted the living
conditions and wellbeing of the indigenous and other residents of the
Arctic. A precondition for being able to answer this question is
developing relevant indicators to measure and compare human development.
Attempts to apply the conventional indicators of the HDI met with many
obstacles because of the lack of comparable official statistics for the
different Arctic jurisdictions. Furthermore, assessing individual
well-being and quality of life, as well as monitoring indicators
reflecting what is most important to indigenous and other Arctic
residents such as ties to nature, cultural continuity and vitality, and
control of destiny, is an even bigger challenge.

That being said, [**the more intense international focus on the
Arctic**, the **increased self-awareness of indigenous peoples**, and
their **creation of national and international organizations** as well
as the establishment of international collaborative entities such as the
Arctic Council **has resulted in a number of promising initiatives
focusing on human development in the circumpolar North**: the AHDR, the
Arctic Social Indicators, and the SLiCA.]{.underline}

The overall **[findings]{.underline}**, which are **[based on official
statistics]{.underline}**, **[indicate that]{.underline}**, generally
speaking, [**conditions have improved** during the first decade of the
twenty-first century **in physical health**]{.underline} ([measured by
infant mortality rate and years of life expectancy]{.underline}),
[**educational** **attainment**]{.underline} (measured by people with a
tertiary education), [**and** **income**]{.underline} (measured by GRP
per capita). The most recent figures and the actual rankings vary among
the different indicators, but [in recent decades **all Arctic regions
have experienced improvements** in physical health, education, and
economic well-being as measured by the HDI indicators.]{.underline} In
comparison, the overall mental health status of many indigenous
populations has suffered.

There are, however, huge differences between regions and between
population groups (especially indigenous and nonindigenous) within
regions. One expression of increased social suffering is the rapid rise
in the rate of death by suicide in several Arctic indigenous
populations, especially among young people.

Surveys comparing well-being among indigenous and nonindigenous groups
in Alaska and Arctic Canada confirm that nonindigenous residents rate
their individual well-being higher than indigenous residents do. [The
SLiCA focused on quality of life of Inuit, Sámi, and the indigenous
peoples of Chukotka and the Kola Peninsula and concluded that despite
facing social problems the majority of Inuit and Sámi were satisfied or
very satisfied with the quality of life in their community.]{.underline}
Among the indigenous people in the two Russian survey regions, the Kola
Peninsula and Chukotka, however, fewer than two out of ten were
satisfied with the quality of life in their community. Furthermore,
[**more than nine out of ten Inuit surveyed** in Greenland and Northern
Alaska, and also Swedish Sámi, **reported that they were satisfied** or
very satisfied **with their quality of life** as a whole.]{.underline}
The availability of fish and wildlife as well as the availability of
wage jobs were important explanatory factors, indicating that to these
indigenous residents a mixed lifestyle is still of utmost importance

### 2AC---Biopolitics Bad

#### Theorizations of biopolitics are insufficient and cedes valuable ground that can actualize material change. Institutions can be malleable, but the K makes it impossible. 

Alexandro **Kioupkiolis 13** is an Associate Professor of Contemporary
Political Theory at Aristotle University, 10/28/2013, "Towards a Regime
of Post-political Biopower? Dispatches from Greece, 2010--2012",

[The concepts of post-politics and biopower may be helpful in theorizing
the current mutations of neoliberal power but they are not fully up to
the task. They have been rightly castigated for constructing an overly
rigid and all-encompassing regime of power which lies beyond challenge
and change.]{.underline} As Bonnie Honig (2009: xv, 66--7, 88) makes
clear, the apocalyptic image of the state of emergency and biopower in
Agamben rules out the possibility of democratic response and cements
'emergency's closures'. It [postulates an all-too solid, omnipotent,
top-down sovereignty which takes exception to the law and cannot be
resisted, covering over remaining fissures, opportunities, drives and
invitations to collective mobilization.]{.underline} Modern sovereignty
could be thought, [instead, 'as a contingent formation that might get
relocated or redistributed in contests over whether a state of exception
should be instituted, in what such a state should consist'
(]{.underline}Honig, 2009[: 88)]{.underline}. In contemporary globalized
capitalism, sovereignty appears to be a multipolar circuit of forces,
'displaced from national to international territories and reconstituted
for the benefit of financial capital' (Saskia Sassen in Dean, 2009:
131--2[). People's power in collective action or electoral politics
remains often a variable component in this mobile, complex and uneven
constellation of forces, at least where liberal democracy has not been
fully torn apart]{.underline}.

Likewise, the 'post-political' qualification of biopower has attracted
incisive criticisms. Jodi Dean argues that left-wing laments about the
rise of technocratic expert rule, the declining significance of
democratic politics under the compulsions of the markets, the
disappearance of the 'political' as radical antagonism are apt but
partial descriptions of our state of affairs. [They obfuscate the
surviving sites of politics and politicization and the real energies of
democratic agency when they are taken as full and comprehensive
accounts. In this case, the emphasis on post-politics 'cedes in advance
key terrains of activism and struggle' (]{.underline}Dean, 2009[:
12).]{.underline} Talk of post-[politics fails thus to recognize and to
engage with the terms of political games which are actually being
played, and it stops short of supporting emerging instances of
democratic agency, producing a vicious circle of self-fulfilling
prophecies]{.underline}.

#### Biopolitics is not all-encompassing -- their theory is a form of confirmation bias that looks for a reason to perpetuate itself.

[There is]{.underline} [also]{.underline} [a strong tendency
in]{.underline} [current]{.underline} [biopolitical research to
assume]{.underline} that these [operations
of]{.underline} [power]{.underline} always succeed, e.g., [always
produce their own forms of subjectivity]{.underline}, but this move
forgets that Foucault was describing apparatuses or technologies that
seek to produce specific effects. He did not assume that these are the
result of conspiracies (since they are often the result of many
different intentions and projects, none of which imagined the particular
apparatus which finally appeared), or that they are inevitably
successful. Moreover, reality is not simply shaped by any one project,
because there are always other projects. Nor is it the result of any
single apparatus of power since there are always multiple apparatuses,
some able to work harmoniously and even to reinforce others (as Foucault
imagined discipline and biopolitics), some able to uncomfortably
co-exist, and some operating against each other. [Every apparatus
engenders its own resistances,]{.underline} limiting its ability to
fully realize the reality it imagines. And different people and
populations may exist in different relations to the apparatus. To put it
differently, [people]{.underline} [often live]{.underline} [with and
within such configurations]{.underline} [of power]{.underline} [in a
variety of ways; there are different forms of consent and
resistance]{.underline} to the demands of power, and to the ways such
practices attempt to produce and fail to produce reality. To take only
one current example, so-called neoliberal forms of governmentality
supposedly demand---and produce---a new entrepreneurial subject, an
individuality that treats its own life as an enterprise, as human
capital. While I don\'t know if this form of subjectivity is new, I am
pretty sure it is only ever partially successful and its successes are
differentially distributed. There are no doubt instances of real
success, but there are more instances of seriously limited success,
cynical consent or even self-conscious avoidance. [It is
these]{.underline} [complexities]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [need
to be analyzed]{.underline}, for they provide the possibilities for
resistance, struggle and transformation. [The tendency to treat biopower
as if it]{.underline} [were new, as if it were successful
and,]{.underline} I might add, increasingly, [as if
it]{.underline} [were]{.underline} [to be
found]{.underline} [everywhere, is]{.underline} at least in part [the
result of a]{.underline} [fetishism of theory:
concepts]{.underline} [become certainties,]{.underline} [demanding to be
used and]{.underline}, in return, [guaranteeing their own truth. If you
go looking for biopower, you will find it.]{.underline} Notions of
biopolitics have been reinforced by further theoretical developments.
Agamben (1998) challenged Foucault\'s theory by both expanding the
historical relevance of biopolitics and contracting its meaning.
According to Agamben, sovereignty (the law) produces biopolitical life
or better, it claims the power to separate the citizen (zoe---a
qualified life, a form of social life) from bare---purely
biological---existence (bios); it claims the power to reduce the citizen
to homo sacer--- bare life---a product and object of power that exists
in a specific and unique relation to the law and society. Homo sacer
exists in a state of exception, an included exclusion, which is the very
mirror image of the sovereign, the one capable of suspending the law in
the name of the law. The state of exception results in the inclusion of
life itself in the juridicalpolitical order by its very exclusion.
Biopower, thus, takes the biopolitical life of citizens into its
political calculation; it is concerned with governing the exigencies and
variations of biological life. While it has a long history ---at least
back to the Greeks for Agamben, it has a different existence in
modernity, becoming explicit and, as it were, normalized, so that it is
no longer seen as that which must be excluded in order to constitute
society, but precisely as the ground of social existence. For Agamben,
the Nazi concentration camp has become the metonym for modern
deployments of bare life, founding a society on the extended duration of
the state of exception. Thus, while Agamben has in one sense a more
specific meaning for biopolitics, he also offers a more general sense of
power asserting itself in and through life as biopolitical production,
and defining the present as a new epoch. The turn to biopolitics more
generally has had important implications for thinking about social
differences and the modalities of exclusion and belonging. It has opened
up new materialist and biological understandings of life, bodies, and
environments as heterogeneous and dynamic. Such analyses, for example,
point to the efforts by various political and capitalist agents to take
up the possibilities of the new molecular and evolutionary biologies to
intervene into the processes of life and the behaviors of bodies, but
the place or relevance of such efforts in relation to larger
organizations of power remains speculative at best. This biological
naturalism also tries to make visible the ways bodies---from corporeal
capacities to the bio-chemical and genetic---serve as material actors or
agents in political relations and struggles. It points to a number of
serious and even unprecedented bio-political and bio-ethical questions,
including: environmental degradation and global climate change, with the
related issues of energy, economic growth and consumer directed
economies; the possibilities of genetic and technological interventions
into life itself; the commodification of aspects of life; the
destruction of genetic diversity, and the transformations of agriculture
and food chains; political, economic and military interventions into
matters of health and well-being; and technological transformations of
the possibilities and relations of sensory experiences of the world.
Again, [one has to ask---and investigate---exactly what is new about
such efforts---after all, efforts to manage and reconfigure bodies and
environments have a longer history in genetics, agriculture, war,
technology, labor (from slavery to Fordism), media and consumption,
etc., although they may not have had the tools to accomplish their task
in such efficient, directed and complicated ways]{.underline}. Many
critics currently working on these issues do recognize such histories,
and often acknowledge as well the important contributions of feminists,
class theorists and critical analysts of race and colonialism. At the
same time, however, this [materialist work often assumes a historical
rupture, that there is \"something unprecedented about our contemporary
situation in which the prefix \'bio-\' proliferates,\" which challenges
\"some of the most basic assumptions that have underpinned the modern
world\" (Coole and Frost, 2010, pp. 15 and 4), that we have entered a
new epoch, constituted by new technologies, practices and forms of
power]{.underline}. It suggests that the new forms of biological and
biotechnical intervention have opened up the possibilities of new forms
of--- micropolitical---control. In Foucault, micropolitics, or capillary
power, describes power operating by moving through and across bodies, or
better, fragments of the body (eyes, hands, etc.) without the mediation
of consciousness and ideology. It is unclear whether Foucault thought
capillary power has always existed, or whether it was introduced with
and made possible the new forms of biopower of the 18th century. But in
either case, there is nothing new about micropolitics today. Perhaps the
current forms of biological rationality and technology have enabled the
development of self-conscious and intentional forms of micropolitical
manipulation, but these have not yet become omnipresent or omnipotent.
[Within theories of biopolitics, everything can become biopolitical; to
offer just one example, Hardt and Negri (2011, pp. 58-9) use it to
describe the practices of immaterial labor as \"the localized productive
powers of life -- that is, the production of affects and languages
through social cooperation and the interaction of bodies and desires,
the invention of new forms of the relation to the self and others, and
so forth.\" Apparently, the biopolitical can be eerily
immaterial]{.underline}. And I am thrown back to the old pragmatic
maxim: [a difference that makes no difference is no
difference.]{.underline} [If everything is
biopolitical]{.underline}---and in one obvious sense it
is, [then]{.underline} [it]{.underline} **[adds very
little]{.underline}** after its first utterance. But such descriptions
of the contemporary conjuncture leave many questions unanswered and even
unaddressed: [Is there anything---any form of activity---that is not
biopolitical? If all of human life]{.underline} (including, e.g.,
labor) [is]{.underline} biopolitical, [hasn\'t it always
been?]{.underline} And if it has, then what is old and what is new? What
are the consequences---the successes and the failures---of the sorts of
relations and arrangements of power it attempts to map? [How does
biopower connect with other forms of power, including those that its
champions (on both sides as it were) seem to deny too quickly---forms of
power involving cognition, consciousness, signification and
representation]{.underline}?

#### Biopolitics confines itself to a mode of knowledge production that justifies inaction. You should reject the method as Left-wing pampering. 

**Solis & Moya 20**, Angel Octavio Alvarez Solis is professor of
philosophy at the university Iberoamericana in Mexico City. Moya holds
an M.A. in philosophy from the same university. "Against Biopolitics:
Compensation and Confinement: Entombing the Academic Left", 9/25/2020,
https://publicseminar.org/essays/against-biopolitics/, MH

[Perhaps due to its successful discursive dissemination, there are few
thinkers --the less judicious or the most reactionary ones-- who
have questioned Michel Foucault's late ideas. These disputes about the
"truth" of biopolitics culminate in such paroxysm that critique has
become a continuous theological diatribe. Everyone is engaged
in an amendment or a commentary on the grand biopolitical text: Paul
B. Preciado disputes Roberto Esposito; Esposito corrects Jean-Luc Nancy; Nancy revises Giorgio Agamben; Agamben adjusts Foucualt, and
so on, until any of us --any average reader-- finds oneself accepting
that the virus is a product of biopower.]{.underline} However, if we
pause the time of the event, [if we take a step back from the totalizing
demand of biopolitics, we may envisage that the biopolitical vocabulary
disables any outside and all exits.]{.underline}

[As a good compensatory theory, biopolitics is an anthropological
diagnosis. As a good theology, biopolitics substantiates life and
kidnaps its own subject matter: life, whether it is one's own, the life
of others, or life in its constitutive fragility.]{.underline}

I am probably exaggerating and not all biopolitics amounts to
confinement. The demand for confinement is probably compatible with
ungovernable life. Indeed, maybe the intensification of absolute control
over life is just beginning to constitute a new world order. Every
crisis has its own doubts, exaggerations, and prophecies. But crises are
also measures of time, indicators, and thresholds. The pandemic is
undoubtedly a threshold. A threshold that doesn't open up a future
because the future is the mode of time currently in jeopardy, so we have
no options or decisions to make about it. [Therefore, the problem is
that if biopolitics is defined as the sovereign administration of life,
it is precisely because, ultimately, life cannot be administered. The
sovereignty of the body is a liberal illusion. Life is always
ungovernable. As Ariadne's thread, biopolitics weaves its sovereign
arguments to construct the garment of confinement.]{.underline}

[Due to the latter, biopolitics sets up subjectivity in a permanent
state of war: a subjectivity articulated as a phármakon that is capable
of carrying within it both evil and salvation.]{.underline} A gnostic
subjectivity. A subjectivity that cures and poisons. A subjectivity with
friends and enemies. [A subjectivity which is at war with itself and
with the world because its isolation "saves lives" and, even if
"contaminated," has no other choice but survival.]{.underline} That the
possibility of a virus lives within each of us implies that everyone
bears the accelerated death of others and oneself. Biopolitics
transforms us into Poe's red masque or into Melville's Bartleby: forms
of anguish that cover the death drive. Biopolitics is always
necropolitics.

Biopolitics occludes the right to death. Biopolitics ensures that life
--just as death-- is a political act, that burying our dead is a
political activity and, in such a total capture of existence, we find
one of the greatest obstacles to live again. Not even the dead are safe
from the exercises of sovereignty. The dead deserve to be outside
statistical expropriation. This is why Giambattista Vico, the
philosopher of the Italian plague of 1656, was not wrong when he claimed
that, no matter how barbaric or civilized, every human form of life
possesses religion, marriage and burial. The loss of the burial rite is
the victory of biopolitics. The number trumps the name. The right to
bury our dead is the first and last locus of resistance against
biopolitical closure. The tomb is the last testimony of life, of our
life. [Therefore, biopolitics cannot be used to exit biopolitics. We
must avoid the biopolitical temptation of Antigone's oblivion because,
as María Zambrano reminds us, "Antigone's tomb is our own obscured
consciousness."]{.underline}

[Biopolitics forecloses the possibility of learning to live amongst
specters, amongst the "non-living," amongst the "dead" or the "nor
living nor dead,"]{.underline} because its aim of governing all life
penetrates the fantasy that life is more important than death: the death
of anyone, the death of our beloved, the death of the
unknown. [Biopolitics is not interested in tombs but in morgues, it
does not imagine cemeteries but death pits, it does not project lives
but counts deaths.]{.underline} Finally, [as
a psychic structure, biopolitics is not capable of governing life nor
generating a sense for survival.]{.underline} As a theory, [biopolitics
does not explain how the life of the dead is possible, nor does it
consider the importance of burial for life itself.]{.underline}
Maybe [it can only envision the politics of death as a statistical
extension of populations. Biopolitics does not conceive of an outside
where not all life is political and not all death is a political
issue. Biopolitics is, ultimately, academia's mode of confinement. For
this reason, slightly fragile and untimely, biopolitics is the
compensation of the academic Left in order to avoid contemplating its
own tomb and realizing that, for a long time, it has carried the virus
of sad passions within itself.]{.underline}

in Modern Capitalist Regulation" -- From the Journal: IJZS; Vol 2.1 -
#CutWithKirby -
http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/viewFile/95/161

Yet such [[cynicism **empirically**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has not
served as a flashpoint for]{.mark} more [transformatory
changes.]{.mark}]{.underline} Both Knights and McCabe as well as Wanous,
Richter, and Austin note the ultimately non-revolutionary character of
this cynicism. Fleming and Spicer (2003) have accordingly sought to
theoretically explain this disjuncture between internal dissatisfaction
and continued external compliance with organizational desires. Their
essay \"Working at a Cynical Distance\" illuminates the relationship
between cynicism and capitalist conformity. Drawing on the work of Lacan
and Zizek they reveal how [[cynical attitudes **reinforce organizational
obedience**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[through displacing resistance **away
from**]{.mark} **actual [practical change]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} **[towards]{.mark}**]{.underline} a
**[[complacency]{.underline}]{.mark}** of internal disagreement. Here,
[[cynicism acts as a salve]{.underline}]{.mark} for individuals who
realize the futility of their working experience yet refuse or are
unable to actualize this dissent. [[Consequently]{.underline}]{.mark},
the very presence of subjective [[distancing works as a barrier ***to
more effective campaigns of resistance*.**]{.mark}]{.underline} How are
we then to understand this seeming contradiction between the daily
presence of individual subjective dis-identification and a continued
compliance to capitalist organizational prerogatives? This cynical
totalitarianism speaks theoretically to two competing elements integral
to contemporary capitalist regulation-namely hegemony and the fetishist
disavowal. Far from being separate both play into and enhance the
overall strength of the other. Interrogating the dominant theorists of
each perspective, Laclau and Zizek respectively, speaks to their
ultimate compatibility. Laclau\'s notion of
[[hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark} highlights how an organizational
ideology [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} suture itself as an all-encompassing
subjectivity due to the fact that discourses [ontologically]{.underline}
[[seek to dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} totally [a given]{.underline}
social [space.]{.underline} [[However]{.underline}]{.mark} [[implicit in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Laclauian [[account is the **eternal
availability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark} ***[contestation to
this hegemon]{.mark}***]{.underline}ic discourse as no one subjectivity
can completely monopolize a subject\'s understanding. [It is at this
juncture between]{.underline} complete interpellation and [hegemony that
cynicism reveals its importance]{.underline} for individual inscription,
an idea expressed most clearly in the work of Zizek. The inherently
incomplete nature of this hegemony provides the very terrain for a
cynical obedience-as one can recognize the inadequacies of a hegemonic
discourse without thinking beyond its ideological horizons. At stake
thus is not internal coherence of a hegemonic discourse but the forms of
enjoyment it provides to its inscribed subject. To this end an
individual is able to participate within a hegemonic field of meaning
without internally accepting its over-arching truth value. Put
differently, [[a dominant social understanding is sustained **exactly
through**]{.underline}]{.mark} the allowance of internal subjective
disagreement premised on [[the **perceived inability to change
prevailing systems of power**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2AC---Markets Good

#### Markets and capital accumulation can [advance Indigenous emancipation]{.underline}.

**Henry, et al, 17**---Te Ara Poutama, Auckland University of Technology
(Ella, with Jamie Newth and Chellie Spiller, "Emancipatory Indigenous
social innovation: Shifting power through culture and technology,"
Journal of Management & Organization, 23:6 (2017), pp. 786--802, dml)

[There are \~**370 million** Indigenous people]{.underline}, [across
**70 countries** worldwide]{.underline}. It is recognised that
[Indigenous peoples practise traditions **unique** to their
cultures]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} that they [retain
**social**]{.underline}, **[cultural]{.underline}**,
**[economic]{.underline}**, [and **political**
characteristics]{.underline}, which make them distinct from the majority
cultures in lands that have been colonised. [Histories of Indigenous
peoples have highlighted the **negative impacts** of]{.underline} those
[majority cultures]{.underline}, most notably [through **conquest** and
**colonisation**]{.underline}. [[The ability of Indigenous peoples to
**survive** and **flourish**]{.underline},]{.mark} [despite these
impacts]{.underline}, [often [rests on the **enterprises** they create
to achieve their goals for **social change** and **social
justice**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[**Indigenous entrepreneurship** is a foundation for understanding
**Indigenous enterprise**]{.underline}, for it is often [Indigenous
entrepreneurs]{.underline} that [create and operate such
entities]{.underline}. [Indigenous entrepreneurship has been defined
as]{.underline}, '[the **[creation]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[management]{.underline}**, [and **development** of new ventures by
Indigenous people for the benefit of Indigenous
people]{.underline}]{.mark}. The organisations thus created can pertain
to either the private, public or non-profit sectors' (Hindle & Moroz,
2010: 363). Hindle and Moroz developed a framework for [Indigenous
entrepreneurship]{.underline} research that [[highlights the]{.mark}
relative [importance of **communities**]{.mark} rather than
**individuals**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} which [[emphasises
**culture** and **social norms** over **resources** and
**profits**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Peredo, Anderson, Gailbraith, Honig, and Dana (2004) acknowledge that
[[Indigenous peoples strive to **plan** and **control** their own
development]{.underline}]{.mark}, [their **[rights over
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and to **[rebuild their
communities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, Indigenous development
founded on Indigenous culture and society has proved problematic, as
[Indigenous entities [**struggle to exist** in the economic]{.mark} and
organisational [systems of the dominant culture]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
a similar vein, Peredo and McLean (2010) discuss how [Indigenous peoples
around the world have turned to **entrepreneurial endeavour** to improve
the conditions of themselves and their communities]{.underline}. They
suggest that '[Indigenous [communities act **collectively** as]{.mark}
both [**entrepreneur** and **enterprise**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [with
profit-making]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[subordinate]{.mark}** to social
outcomes]{.underline}' (2010: 614).

For Cahn, '[In Indigenous societies **throughout the
world**]{.underline} "**[business]{.underline}**" [and **economic
activities** are embedded in **cultural** and **social
aspects**]{.underline}, [creating **unique styles** of
entrepreneurship]{.underline}, which are [often
**community-oriented**]{.underline}, and [with **diverse livelihood
outcomes**]{.underline}' (2008: 1). Her focus is Indigenous
entrepreneurship, culture and micro-enterprise in Samoa. Cahn found
that, 'where micro-enterprises blend well with fa'aSamoa1 , an
"Indigenous" style of enterprise develops, and fa'aSamoa is a motivating
factor and asset, which enhances entrepreneurial activity' (2008: 16).
Further, she found that [whilst cash was an **important outcome** of
enterprise]{.underline}, [so too was]{.underline} the [**social** and
**cultural capital**]{.underline}, 'that was [developed through
**actively engaging** in]{.underline} the [values and
expression]{.underline} of fa'aSamoa' (2008: 17).

In their definitive text Dana and Anderson note that, 'there is a rich
heterogeneity among Indigenous peoples, and some of their cultural
values are often incompatible with the basic assumptions of mainstream
theories. Indigenous entrepreneurship often has non-economic explanatory
variables... We propose that entrepreneurship opportunity recognition
and evaluation is therefore culturally determined: however, we note that
culturally determined opportunities for entrepreneurship are often
disrupted by entities external to Indigenous peoples' (2007: 601).

Further, Henry, Dana, and Murphy (2017: 5) argue that [[Indigenous
entrepreneurship]{.underline}]{.mark} differs from the dominant
theoretic themes of mainstream research into entrepreneurship, which
tends to focus on the characteristics of individuals. The literature
from Indigenous scholars, on the other hand, often [[focusses on the
**emancipatory nature** of **entrepreneurial actions**]{.mark} and
**intent**]{.underline}. They write, 'The approach is different because
it focusses on how [entrepreneurs and communities can **surmount [unique
social]{.mark}** [and **environmental constraints**]{.mark}]{.underline}
that apply to them'.

Herein lies one of the conceptual overlaps between social innovation,
cultural capital, and Indigenous entrepreneurship. Aramburu and Saenz
(2011) note that an organisation's ability to innovate is linked to its
intellectual capital, or new knowledge. This paper argues that an
organisation's innovation capabilities are also linked to its cultural
capital, which Throsby defines as 'an asset embodying cultural value'
(1999: 3). Throsby adds that culture should be added to the three
traditionally acknowledged forms of capital -- physical, human, and
natural -- because it enriches economic analyses. The [Indigenous
entrepreneurship]{.underline} literature also [[highlights the
**significance of**]{.underline}]{.mark} both social and cultural
**[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Light and Dana (2013) recognise that
social [capital **assists** Indigenous entrepreneurs in terms of
the]{.underline} social, networking and others [[**resources** it brings
and the **strategic relationships** it generates]{.underline}]{.mark},
whilst Henry, Dana, and Murphy (2017) link cultural capital to
environmental context, personal identity and self-efficacy, which have
been found to enhance entrepreneurial intent amongst Indigenous peoples.

The Arctic is home to approximately 4 million people and 9 per cent of
them are indigenous peoples who live in settlements across two
continents and eight countries.^19^ Approximately 155,000 Inuit reside
in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Russia; 55,000 Athabaskans and Gwich'in
people live in Alaska and Canada, and 15,000 Aleut live in different
territories of Alaska and Russia.^20^ Russia is also home to 250,000
members of different indigenous groups, including the Sami people.^21^
The Sami people are the only indigenous people recognised in Europe^22^
and live across territories in Norway, Finland and Sweden.^23^ [The
majority of Arctic settlements are located on permafrost, and nearly
half of them are coastal permafrost settlements, which reinforces the
importance of the distinct Arctic environment to the livelihoods and
cultural identity of the Arctic indigenous peoples.]{.underline}^24^

**[Climate change has had a profound impact on the living environment of
Arctic indigenous peoples]{.underline}**, and thus, it merits special
attention. The Artic is characterised 'as the world's climate change
barometer'.^25^ According to the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC), 'surface warming in the Arctic will continue
to be more pronounced than the global average warming over the 21st
century'.^26^ [It is expected that '**additional warming** will lead to
more frequent and intense marine heatwaves and is projected to further
**amplify permafrost thawing** and loss of seasonal snow cover,
glaciers, land ice and Arctic sea ice'.]{.underline}^27^ A significant
decline in sea ice and glaciers is already being witnessed in the
Chukchi and Beaufort seas.^28^ Decline in seasonal sea ice and higher
sea levels increase coastal hazards, such as flooding and coastal
erosion.^29^ Such [changes have resulted in, and are projected to
further lead to, **restrictions on indigenous peoples' access to
ancestral lands and natural resources, loss of land** and houses or
**forced relocation** and mass resettlements]{.underline}, which
directly affect the enjoyment of the right to property.^30^ In addition,
[there have been serious consequences for the main sources of income of
indigenous communities, as the thinni**ng of ice makes it more difficult
to hunt and fish** and **climate change has led to the degradation of
reindeer pastures** and to a **lack of available food** for reindeer
herding.]{.underline}^31^

[**Ocean warming** and acidification are also responsible for the
**depletion of fish stocks** and decline in other marine species,
**limiting the opportunities of Arctic indigenous people to access
marine resources, threatening their income, food security and cultural
heritage.**]{.underline}^32^ [Reduction in sea ice may facilitate
overfishing, which]{.underline}, in turn, [is likely to affect the fish
stocks and the fishing practices of Arctic indigenous peoples, many of
whom rely on small-scale subsistence fishing.]{.underline}^33^
[Sea-level rise]{.underline} can also change coastal configuration or
lead to the partial or complete loss of islands. This will affect the
baselines from which maritime zones are measured and may result in their
reduction or disappearance. ^34^ Such scenario [could severely limit the
access of the Arctic indigenous communities to natural resources,
including their fishing rights.]{.underline}

Beyond the direct impact that rising temperatures have on the enjoyment
of the living environment of the indigenous communities, it is worth
evaluating the indirect impact that climate change has had on it. [The
**receding ice cap has made the waters more navigable.** **Enhanced
accessibility** has been as**sociated with a growth in all forms of
shipping.**]{.underline}^35^ [**Ship operations** are **associated
with** high risks for the marine environment, such as
**pollution**]{.underline} (oil, air and noise pollution, sewage and
garbage) [and damage or disruption to the marine ecosystem through
ballast water and hull biofouling or by icebreaking and animal deaths
caused by ship strikes.]{.underline}^36^ [**Black carbon emissions from
shipping and oil spills** have been a major cause for alarm because of
the **disastrous impact** they could have on the fragile ecosystem of
the coastal communities.]{.underline} The rapid expansion of extractive
activities has also caused concern to the Arctic indigenous communities.
[**Pipelines**, oil and gas extraction and production are known for
transforming and **polluting the environment in diverse ways forcing the
Arctic indigenous peoples to relocate** or adapt their social and
economic practices to different ways of living, such as by adapting
their harvesting, hunting and fishing practices.]{.underline}^37^
Considering the changes reported in the Arctic environment, which have a
significant impact on the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, the next
section explores the extent to which regional human rights law can
contribute to protecting the right to property against some of the
effects of climate change.

In February 2023, [Pavel Sulyandziga highlighted the disproportionate
number of Russian Indigenous people who have been conscripted to fight
in the War in Ukraine. On the Russian side, the number of Indigenous
combatants in the war is proportionally higher than the number of ethnic
Russians combatants. With mobilization criteria paying no respect to
Indigeneity and the roles of men within those societies, recruitment has
had deleterious effects on the cultures and traditions of Indigenous
peoples in Russia.]{.underline}41 Furthermore, [data sets]{.underline}
(collected by a team of volunteers from the social media and other
available sources) [demonstrate large inequalities in the army mortality
rates across Russian regions]{.underline}, with the highest mortality of
soldiers originating from poor regions in Siberia and the Russian Far
East and the lowest from Moscow and St. Petersburg.42 In short, [the
share of Indigenous peoples in the total number of deaths in the war
appears to be disproportionately high, based on official Russian
statistics and numbers provided by Russian scientists.]{.underline}
Consequently, [it is reasonable to conclude that the war in Ukraine has
rendered Russia's Indigenous peoples more vulnerable and has imposed a
disproportionate burden and cost on them.]{.underline} This story is not
well known in Russia owing to censorship.

A 2022 article by Umea University (Sweden) doctoral student Ekaterina
Zmyvalova provides a helpful summary of how the war in Ukraine
negatively affects the human rights of Indigenous small-numbered peoples
of Russia. These include the right to freedom of expression, the right
to enjoy their culture, and the right to life, liberty and security.
Specific impacts include:

> • Russia's growing disregard for its international legal obligations;
>
> • [the introduction of new sanctions against persons and organizations
> who do not support the Russian regime's official discourses about the
> war, and increased pressure on Indigenous peoples' representatives to
> strictly adhere to state messaging or face intimidation]{.underline}
> (like the Tannagasheva case noted in the previous section) [and severe
> legal consequences]{.underline};
>
> • [the active participation of Indigenous small-numbered peoples in
> the war due to socio- economic challenges facing their
> communities]{.underline} (including a lack of wage-earning
> opportunities compared to other Russian populations) [and the absence
> of reliable and objective information about the war in
> Ukraine]{.underline};
>
> • [a decline in international cooperation with the Indigenous
> small-numbered peoples of Russia]{.underline} (as it is hard for
> international organizations to trust Russian-based Indigenous people's
> organizations because of their adherence to the Kremlin's narratives
> about the war); and
>
> • [increasing constraints on Russian Indigenous peoples in
> participating in international decision-making, including the Arctic
> Council]{.underline} (given the decision by the seven like- minded
> Arctic states to suspend participation in Council activities involving
> Russia).43

In a short update released in January 2023, Zmyvalova notes that, [on
the Russian side, the number of Indigenous combatants in the war is
proportionally higher than the number of ethnic Russians
combatants.]{.underline} "[The Indigenous population is more vulnerable
and on average of lower socio- economic status than ethnic
Russians]{.underline}," she notes, "hence participation in the war is
financially more attractive for them." Furthermore, activists note that
mobilizing persons from areas "far from Moscow and St. Petersburg is a
way for the Kremlin to reduce the draft's impact on major cities, where
the chances of opposition protests are higher." Most Russian Indigenous
populations reside in small settlements or villages, some of which have
seen most of the male population mobilized. With mobilization criteria
paying no respect to Indigeneity and the roles of men within those
societies, [recruitment has had deleterious effects on the cultures and
traditions of Indigenous peoples in Russia.]{.underline}44

[Alexey Bessudnov]{.underline}, a sociology professor at the University
of Exeter, [released a paper]{.underline} in December 2022 [showing
ethnic and regional inequalities in mortality in the Russian army during
the 2022 war in Ukraine.]{.underline} Based on a data set (collected by
a team of volunteers from the social media and other available sources)
containing the names of about 9,500 Russian servicemen killed in Ukraine
from February to November 2022, [he demonstrates large inequalities in
the army mortality rates across Russian regions]{.underline}, with the
highest mortality of soldiers originating from poor regions in Siberia
and the Russian Far East and the lowest from Moscow and St. Petersburg.
[Some ethnic minority groups, in particular Buryats]{.underline} (a
Mongolic ethnic group native to southeastern Siberia) [and
Tuvans]{.underline} (a Turkic ethnic group Indigenous to Siberia ) [are
overrepresented among the fatalities compared to their share of the
Russian population.]{.underline} Bessudnov suggests that [ethnic
fatality gaps are largely driven by socio-economic
inequalities]{.underline}, with young men in poorer regions see the
career in the military as more attractive.45 In short, [statistic
evidence confirms that most Russian army recruits and conscripts come
from peripheral regions]{.underline} where unemployment, drug addiction
and criminality are rampant. Furthermore, [the share of Indigenous
peoples in the total number of deaths in the war appears to be
disproportionately high, based on official Russian statistics and
numbers provided by Russian scientists.]{.underline} Consequently, [it
is reasonable to conclude that the war in Ukraine has rendered Russia's
Indigenous peoples more vulnerable and has imposed a disproportionate
burden and cost on them.]{.underline} This story does not appear to be
well known or accepted in Russia.

[In the wake of Russia's expanded war of aggression against Ukraine,
Russia's northern Indigenous communities have experienced a
disproportionate degree of hardship.]{.underline} Given their small
sizes, remoteness, and ethnicities, these [communities]{.underline}
[have been]{.underline} particularly [targeted by Russian mobilization
efforts. This builds on decades of Russian state abuse, surrounding land
use and resource development that has ignored local concerns and damaged
traditional Indigenous territories. Arctic Indigenous
leadership]{.underline}, in the form of the Russian Association of
Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON) [has been coopted by the
Kremlin and is now little more than a mouthpiece for government
directives.]{.underline} Consequently, [many Indigenous leaders have
fled Russia]{.underline} -- but these political exiles retain important
networks inside Russia, where locals continue to resist state
oppression. Nevertheless, [while Russia has long paid lip service to
Indigenous rights, the state's growing totalitarian tendencies and
confrontation with the West has led to near total state control over
regional representative organizations.]{.underline}

This NAADSN Policy Primer begins with a background overview of RAIPON
and its transformation into a state-controlled organ in the early 2010s
before analyzing its statements supporting Russia's war of aggression
against Ukraine. Our analysis discerns that it has promoted three key
narratives since February 2022: that RAIPON is a staunch supporter of
the Kremlin and of President Vladimir Putin personally; that RAIPON is a
strategic link between Russia and the so-called "newly acquired
territories" (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhian oblasts); and
that RAIPON is the only legitimate representative of Russia's Arctic and
Siberian Indigenous population. We then provide a short assessment of
how [the War in Ukraine has affected Russia's Indigenous peoples,
despite Russian narratives claiming widespread Indigenous support for
the war effort.]{.underline} The last section identifies voices of
dissent associated with the International Committee of Indigenous
Peoples of Russia (ICIPR) and the "Indigenous Russia" (iRussia)
information center. Our conclusions reflect on how political divisions
amongst the Arctic states, dramatically exacerbated by the War in the
Ukraine, are also reflected amongst and within the Permanent
Participants to the Arctic Council.

suggest a conversation between Moten and Sheldon Wolin. The parallels
are striking. Wolin depicts a "system" so "immovable and interconnected
as to be unreformable as a totality"; he calls "pessimism" a "reasoned
insight" and "suppressed revolutionary impulse"; and he endorses a
"rejectionism" whereby citizens "withdraw and direct their energies and
civic commitment to finding new life forms." Moreover, "instead of
imitating most political theories," which adopt "the state as the
primary structure, and adapt the activity of citizens" to it, Wolin
refuses "the state paradigm" and the "liberal-legal corruption of the
citizen."

#### Refusal fails and it locked into the NEG into the university, imperiling resistance. 

**Webb 18**, Senior Lecturer in Education at the University of Sheffield
(Darren Webb, 3-20-2018, \"Bolt-holes and breathing spaces in the
system: On forms of academic resistance (or, can the university be a
site of utopian possibility?),\" Review of Education, Pedagogy, and
Cultural Studies, Vol. 40, Issue 2,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10714413.2018.1442081)

In Teaching to Transgress, bell hooks heralded the university seminar
room as "a place where paradise can be created" (hooks 1994, 207). How
might we conceive the contemporary seminar room as such a space? It is
important to remind ourselves here that domination is always partial and
"leaky" (Giroux 2000, 144). Mainstream educational settings are not
completely closed and educational practices are not totally controlled
(Evans and Giroux 2015, 33). Spaces for "utopian pedagogical
experimentation" still exist (Dyer-Witherford 2007, 59). It is still
possible, for example, to teach "radical" courses that link everyday
life to the production of values and power (Coté, Day, and de Peuter
2007b), to offer "subversive" collective readings of utopian texts
(Seyferth 2009), and to practice "disruptive" pedagogies that encourage
the emergence of counter-narratives (Adsit et al. 2015). There is scope
still for a dialogical pedagogy that prefigures in the very process of
collaborative learning the kind of social relations that might
characterize an alternative way of being. In the classroom, "we can show
\[students\] that there are possibilities for doing things another way,
that we don't have to live like this if we choose not to do so" (Shannon
2009, 188). But let us acknowledge the limitations. A seminar, an
undergraduate module, a Masters program---these are going to do little
to challenge the corporate-imperial university. The utopian educator may
work hard to protect their autonomous learning spaces, and to make these
sites for experiments in new forms of thought and practice, but we
should not overestimate their transformative potential. Here I note four
limitations to the utopian classroom: Firstly, there is often a profound
disjuncture between the claims made on behalf of a particular program or
project and the realities of its enactment. Mike Neary's
"student-as-producer," for example, sought "to design an alternative
model for the university, as a rehearsal for an alternative social world
within which it might subsist" (Neary 2010). Informed by Marx, Benjamin,
Lefebvre, Debord, and others, student-as-producer "brings revolutionary
pedagogy to life" and prefigures a postcapitalist society characterized
by "from each according to their abilities" (Neary 2012a, 5--6). On
paper, then, it seems that Neary---occupying a position of power as Dean
of Teaching and Learning at the University of Lincoln between
2007--2014---was creating a transformative utopian space in every
classroom across the entire campus. The reality, however, was somewhat
more modest. Beneath the endless references to radical thinkers past and
present, what student-as-producer actually did was enhance the research
component of the undergraduate curriculum (Neary 2014) while being
pragmatically "mindful of the need for the university to survive and
prosper" (Neary 2010). A worthwhile endeavor certainly, but hardly a
revolutionary project prefiguring post-capitalist society. The field of
critical pedagogy/radical education is heavy on bombast and the
realities of the utopian classroom often fall short of the theory-heavy
promises.6 Secondly, a focus on the classroom as the site of utopian
practice is sometimes accompanied by a simplistic model of social
change. Even in its most revolutionary formulations---in the work of
Paula Allman (2001), for example---the [classroom
interactions]{.underline} of the utopian educator [are directed towards
**transforming individual consciousness**. [It is]{.mark} then
[assumed]{.mark} that enlightened [individuals]{.mark}, newly
conscientized, will [leave the classroom and]{.mark} **somehow
[bring]{.mark} about social [change]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Lissovoy
2009, 198; Cho 2013, 94). At its worst, [[utopian pedagogy
**shares**]{.mark} **the quasi-[colonial understanding of change typical
of the]{.mark} corporate-imperial [university]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Wink, for example, tells us that radical pedagogy "starts in the
classroom but goes out into the community to make life a little better"
(Wink 2011, 24). Darder, too, talks about an emancipatory pedagogy that
seeks to "reach beyond the boundaries of the classroom into communities,
workplaces, and public arenas" (Darder 2009, 158). Here we have a
process akin to the manifold "outreach" activities undertaken by higher
education institutions, through which communities are blessed by
interventions from the academy, "reaching out" to make their lives a
little better, in a contemporary form of noblesse oblige (Seybold 2008).
Thirdly, the corporate-imperial university draws strength from the
utopian classroom, happily accommodating sites of resistance in order to
recuperate them as symbols of its tolerance (Oparah 2014). The utopian
classroom might be seen as "a release-valve for intellectual
dissonance ... supervised by its very enemies" (Inoperative Committee
2011, 4). A release valve because, as Michael Apple has long complained,
radical pedagogy is often adopted to resolve personal crises brought
about by the "contradictory class location" of academics who want to
portray themselves as politically engaged (2013, 14). Spaces of
experimentation within the academy may have as much to do with "a
certain ritual of self-display" as they do with any form of genuine
commitment to social transformation (Ĉiĉigoj, Apostolou-Hölscher, and
Rusham 2015, 272). Students, too, are aware that "radical" courses on
campus serve as a "vaccination" against future outbreaks of radicalism
in society at large (Anon 2010c, 32). As one group put it: "A taste of
the poison serves well to inoculate us against any confrontational
radicalism" (Anon 2010b, 15). This release of dissonance is supervised
by its enemies in the simple but very real sense that contemporary
university governance includes so that it can control (De Nicola and
Roggero 2011, 36). Finally, [[the]{.mark} utopian [classroom **will
never be** ]{.mark}**anything [more than]{.mark} a [fringe
performance]{.mark}** to be tolerated at the margins]{.underline}. The
university, of course, is hostile to radical learning spaces "trying to
establish outcomes contrary to the logic of the market" (Albert 2007,
324). It is well noted that critical/radical/utopian spaces within the
academy are shrinking (Shear 2008, 56; Canaan 2013; Amsler 2015, 169,
Lawrence 2015) and that departments offering perspectives challenging
the mainstream risk closure (Seybold 2008, 117--118; Adsit et al. 2015,
22). It is also worth highlighting that the utopian university is
unviable in the absence of wider systemic change because, quite simply,
"any university that operated along these lines would quickly become
irrelevant to the vast majority of people who need an education that
provides them with a better chance of finding work" (Holmes and Research
and Destroy and Dead Labour 2011, 13). [The utopian
classroom]{.underline}, then, [will remain a novelty to be controlled
within the corporate-imperial university]{.underline}. And "as long as
the radical is in the minority, as long as the radical is unable to
drive campus culture, nothing is threatened" (Prashad 2014, 330). The
utopian classroom is more a safe haven to retreat to than a space that
can spearhead social transformation. I am taken in particular by
Zaslove's (2007, 98) description of utopian pedagogy as "an exiled form
of education" in search of "bolt holes and breathing spaces in the
system." [This is a **powerful** and **illuminating
metaphor**]{.underline}. The dictionary definition of bolt-hole is, "A
place where you can escape and hide from something that is dangerous or
unpleasant." The "search for bolt-holes" captures something of the
reality of utopian pedagogy within the corporate-imperial university.
[The utopian classroom **creates a breathing space in the suffocating
environment of the formal education system**, **a safe space in which
one can hide from the dangerous spread of market forces** and **the
unpleasant stench of neoliberalism**. But the utopian educator is
forever on the back foot, retreating, as spaces shrink. The utopian
classroom may **offer refuge** and **respite but something more is
needed**.]{.underline}

The undercommons

["The undercommons" is associated with]{.underline} the work of Fred
Moten, Stefano Harney ([**Harney** and **Moten**]{.underline} 2013)
[and]{.underline} Stevphen **[Shukaitis]{.underline}** (2009;
Undercommoning Collective 2016). At one level, [undercommoning is
concerned with creating spaces within the
academy]{.underline}---"liminal and recombinant spaces" for "subversion"
and "sabotage," as Shukaitis puts it (Shukaitis 2009, 173). [These
spaces are infused with a utopian dimension as they are inhabited by a
network of radical alliances who resist elitism, enclosure,
commercialization, and "seek to mobilize the unique historical location
and material power of the university to imagine and build a world beyond
the present order"]{.underline} (Haiven and Khasnabish 2014, 12). By
undercommoning together and forging solidarities, the tensions and
contradictions of the contemporary academy can be transformed into
"visions, actions and experiments for a radically different world"
(Undercommoning Collective 2016). But [the undercommons is more than
just the creation of spaces with utopian intent. It is a shifting matrix
of spaces, processes, relations, and structures of feeling. Harney and
Moten do **attach importance to teaching** and the
**classroom**]{.underline}---[in particular as an opportunity to
**refuse the call to order**]{.underline}---[but the undercommons
**exists in institutional cracks** outside the classroom]{.underline}:
in stairwells, in alleys, in kitchens, in corridors, in smoking areas,
in hiding. [The undercommons is a community of maroons, outcasts, and
fugitives]{.underline}, not of responsible teachers. It is "always an
unsafe neighbourhood" (Harney and Moten 2013, 28). In fact, [the
undercommons is best described as a way of being: a way of being within
and against one's institution and a way of being with and for the
community of outcasts]{.underline} (Melamed 2016). [Within and against
the corporate-imperial university, the subversive intellectual is
unprofessional, uncollegial, impractical, disruptive, disloyal,
unproductive, unreliable, "obstructive and shiftless, dumb with
insolence," **forever refusing the call to order**]{.underline} (Harney
and Moten 2013, 34). [With and for the undercommons, **hapticality
describes a way of feeling that is at once unsettled**---"to feel at
home with the homeless, at ease with the fugitive, at peace with the
pursued"]{.underline}---[and intensely intimate---"**the capacity to
feel through others**, **for others to feel through you, for you to feel
them feeling you**"]{.underline} (97--98). Together, the maroons of the
undercommons engage in study; a mode of sociality, "a kind of way of
being with others," walking and talking and thinking and working
together "in a way that feels good, the way it should feel good"
(111--112, 117). There is a definite utopian project at work here. Moten
tells us that "I believe in the world and want to be in it. I want to be
in it all the way to the end of it because I believe in another world in
the world and I want to be in that" (Harney and Moten 2013, 118). The
undercommons is presented as an entry point to this other world in the
world. It is a "utopic commonunderground," a utopia "submerged in the
interstices and on the outskirts of the fierce and urgent now" (Moten
2008, 1746; Harney and Moten 2013, 51). The call to both disorder and to
study---what Freire might have termed the utopian process of
denunciation-annunciation---becomes an ontological enactment of
something that is already here (Harney and Moten 2013, 133--134). For
Harney in particular, the undercommons as a way of being can be
understood in terms of rhythm. It is a new rhythm working against the
global rhythm of work, the "global assembly line tearing apart the
functions of man," the rhythm of inputs and outputs every facet of which
must be "measured and managed" (Harney 2015, 174--176). In contrast, the
rhythm of the undercommons is "a militant arrhythmia" that unsettles the
rhythm of the line, "invites us to feel around us" and brings the utopic
commonunderground into the open (177--178). [**It is easy to be seduced
by the language of the undercommons**. Embodying and enacting it,
however, is **difficult indeed**. [Being]{.mark} within and [against the
university, refusing]{.mark} the call to [order]{.mark} through insolent
obstructive unprofessionalism, [is]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
**[[impossible]{.mark} to sustain]{.underline}**. Halberstam (2009, 45)
describes the undercommons as "a marooned community of outcast thinkers
who refuse, resist, and renege on the demands of rigor, excellence, and
productivity." [A romantic and appealing notion for sure but
[refusing]{.mark} and reneging on "the university of excellence" [will
**cost you your job**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When Moten describes
subversion as a "series of immanent upheavals" expressed through "vast
repertoires of high-frequency complaints, imperceptible frowns,
withering turns, silent sidesteps, and ever-vigilant attempts not to see
and hear" (2008, 1743), one is reminded instantly of Thomas Docherty,
disciplined and suspended for his negative vibes.7 Being with and for
the maroon community is difficult too. First of all, "[**Where** and
**how** can we find/see the Undercommons at work?"]{.underline}
(Ĉiĉigoj, Apostolou-Hölscher, and Rusham 2015, 265). Where and how can
one find those liminal spaces of sabotage and subversion, and [how does
one occupy them in a spirit of hapticality]{.underline}, study, and
militant arrhythmia that brings the utopic underground to the surface of
the fierce and urgent now? Beautiful language, but how does one live it?
Networks do, of course, exist---[the Undercommoning Collective, the
Edu-Factory Collective, the International Network for Alternative
Academia, to name but a few. These are promising spaces for bringing
together and harboring the maroons and the fugitives. But **[networks
are]{.mark} typically [short-lived]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and---as
Harney and Moten warned---[there is a **danger of
institutionalization**, of taking institutional practices with you into
alternative spaces "because we've been inside so much"]{.underline}
(Harney and Moten 2013, 148). And so, predictably, meetings of the
fugitives come with structure, order, an official agenda, and circulated
minutes. The outcasts convene in conventional academic conferences, with
parallel sessions, panels of papers, lunch breaks, wine and nibbles
(e.g., Edu-Factory 2012). These spaces offer time out, welcome respite,
a breathing space, a trip abroad, and then one returns to work. If
hapticality, the touch of the undercommons, is "a [visceral register of
experience]{.underline} ... the feel that what is to come is here"
(Bradley 2014, 129--130), then this [seems **elusive**]{.underline}. It
is hard to detect a sense of the utopic undercommons rising to the
surface of the corporate-imperial university. [Moten describes the call
to disorder and to study as a way to "excavate new aesthetic, political,
and economic dispositions]{.underline}" (Moten 2008, 1745). But [this
notion of excavating is **highly problematic**. It is common within the
discourse of "everyday utopianism"---finding utopia in the everyday,
recovering lost or repressed transcendence in
"everydayness"]{.underline} (Gardiner 2006)---to describe the process of
utopian recovery in terms of excavating: excavating repressed desires,
submerged longings, suppressed histories, untapped possibilities. But
the [fundamental [questions of where]{.mark} to dig [and how to identify
a utopian "find" are **never**]{.mark} **adequately
[addressed]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Webb 2017). Gardiner defines
utopia as "a series of forces, tendencies and possibilities that are
immanent in the here and now, in the pragmatic activities of everyday
life" (2006, 2). But how are these forces, tendencies and possibilities
to be identified and recovered? For Harney and Moten, it is through
study, hapticality and militant arrhythmia. These are slippy concepts,
however, evading concrete material referents. What is it to inhabit the
undercommons? Those who have written of their experiences refer to
"small acts of marronage" such as poaching resources and redeploying
them in ways at odds with the university's designs and demands (Reddy
2016, 7), or exploiting funding streams "to form cracks in the
institution that enable the Others to invade the university" (Smith,
Dyke, and Hermes 2013, 150). For Adusei-Poku (2015), the undercommons is
a space of refuge which is all about survival (2015, 4--5). We who feel
homeless in the university are forced into refuge. We gather together to
survive. We may gain satisfaction from small acts of marronage, but this
is less about bringing [[the]{.mark} utopic common
[underground]{.mark}]{.underline} to the surface as it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a form of "radical
**[[escapism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Adusei-Poku 2015, 4). Benveniste
(2015, v) tells us that: "[The undercommons has **[no]{.mark} set
[location]{.mark}** and **no return address**. There is **no [map for
entering]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **no [guide for
staying]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The only condition is a living appetite.
Listen to its hunger for difference." We need more than poetry, however.
And we need more than a series of minor acts of resistance. As Srnicek
and Williams rightly emphasize, [[resistance is]{.mark} a defensive,
[reactive]{.mark} gesture, resisting against. Resistance is [not]{.mark}
a **[utopian]{.mark}=endeavour**]{.underline}: "We do not resist a new
world into being" (Srnicek and Williams 2016, 47). [The
undercommons]{.underline}, when one can find it, [is a bolt hole, a
place of refuge, a breathing space in the system. **We need something
more**.]{.underline}

The use of indigeneity as a common signifier has fostered mobilisation
across different ethnic groups. This process has been aided by NGOs and
técnicos (technical experts) that accompanied the Eighth and Ninth
Marches. NGO representatives facilitated meetings, provided training,
funded activities and constructed written announcements and texts. These
mediatory actors therefore helped to re-articulate the grievances of the
marchers under the banner of indigenous rights. This could be seen in
the writing of open letters to the government during both the Eighth and
Ninth Marches, made possible through the aid of technical experts from
one of the principle legal organisations defending indigenous rights in
Bolivia CEJIS (Centro de Estudios Jurídicos e Investigación Social;
Centre of Legal Studies and Social Investigation). Therefore, [in order
to 'speak' and be heard, the indigenous peoples have to undergo a
process of representation through the language of legal rights. They
therefore remain 'subaltern' because their attempts at
self-representation fall outside the 'the lines laid down by the
official institutional structures of representation']{.underline}
(Spivak 1996: 306). Thus, Glenn (2011) contends that the UN Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is [ironic since it seeks the
recognition of alternative epistemologies through civic institutions
that have homogenising and universalising tendencies.
However]{.underline}, as Fabricant notes in her work with the Landless
Peasants Movement in Bolivia, movements 'take NGO ideas and meld them
with their own creative strategies to come up with solutions that will
work for their communities' (2012: 120). Moreover, Gustafson (2009b)
offers a balanced interpretation of the ways that NGOs offer a language
and model for politicising alternative worldviews. [[The
indigenous]{.mark} movement consciously reifies certain strategic
essentialisms whilst at other times actively resisting them. Indeed,
indigenous knowledges do not exist outside of other knowledge
forms]{.underline} (Walsh 2002). As Walsh argues '[\[t\]he **efficacy**
of the movement in fact derives from its ability to construct and use
the **correspondences** among various contemporary knowledge
position**s**]{.underline} \[...\] [in order to exercise **political
tactics** and strategies']{.underline} (2002: 71). [**A politics of
refusal is unlikely to advance indigenous demands**. As
such]{.underline}, Hale suggests an analytical framework based on the
Gramscian notion of articulation to ask: will the subjugated knowledge
and practices be articulated within the dominant, and neutralised? Or
will they occupy the space opened from above while resisting its built
in logic, connect with others, toward 'transformative'
cultural-political alternatives that still cannot be fully imagined?
(2002: 499). Indeed, [there is the danger that identifying under a
**single** indigenous label **risks losing** the **complexities** and
processes that permeate the **heterogeneous inter-ethnic collectivity**
of the]{.underline} lowland [indigenous movement]{.underline}. This acts
to disembody the identity claims from some of the more radical tangents
of the movement. [Mexican anthropologist Miguel Alberto Bartolomé argues
that indigenous autonomy should contemplate 'new modes of \[interethnic,
inter-cultural\] social articulation that are more egalitarian than
existing \[ones\]' and that a multi-ethnic state 'should explore **all
possible paths** in the search for novel forms of conviviality between
culturally distinct groups']{.underline} (2005: 146 cited in Gustafson
2009a: 998). Escobar similarly [calls for a **decolonisation** that 'can
be started in earnest from a **deessentialized**
perspective']{.underline} (2008: 305). [Indeed, the movement seeks the
recognition of plurality without the homogenisation of indigenous
cultures or ideologies or the ranking of difference that necessarily
works to subordinate some cultures and let others dominate]{.underline}.
This project of emancipatory societal transformation is an on-going
challenge for the lowland indigenous movement.

Dialogue, La Trobe University; Theory, Culture, and Society,

to Decolonization," vol. 35 no. 1; DML\]

[The prescription for decolonisation]{.underline}---that is, [a
normative project committed to the **liberation of the colonised** and
the **overturning of colonial relationships of power**]{.underline}
(Kohn & McBride, 2011: 3)---[is]{.underline} indeed [one of the **most
counterhegemonic implications** of the settler colonial
paradigm]{.underline} as applied to IsraelPalestine, [potentially
shifting it from a diagnostic frame to a prognostic one which offers a
'proposed solution to the problem, or at least a plan of
attack']{.underline} (Benford & Snow, 2000: 616). [What]{.underline},
however, [does the settler colonial paradigm offer by way of
**envisioning decolonisation**?]{.underline} As Veracini (2007) notes,
while settler colonial studies scholars have sought to address the lack
of attention paid to the experiences of Indigenous peoples in
conventional historiographical accounts of decolonisation (which have
mostly focused on settler independence and the loosening of ties to the
'motherland'), [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} nevertheless [[a
'**narrative deficit**' when]{.mark} it comes to **[imagining]{.mark}
settler [decolonisation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Veracini (2007)
relates this deficit to a matter of conceptualisation, it is apparent
that [[the **structural** ]{.mark}**perspective** of the
[paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline} in many ways [**[closes down]{.mark}
possibilities** of **imagining the type of social** and [**political
transformation** to which]{.mark} the **notion of [decolonisation
aspires]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this regard, [there is a **worrying
tendency**]{.underline} ([if not **tautological
discrepancy**]{.underline}) [in settler colonial studies, where the
**only solution to settler colonialism is decolonisation**---which a
faithful adherence to the paradigm **renders largely unachievable**, if
not **impossible**]{.underline}.

To understand why this is the case, it is necessary to return to Wolfe's
(2013a: 257) account of settler colonialism as guided by a 'zero-sum
logic whereby settler societies, for all their internal complexities,
uniformly require the elimination of Native alternatives'. The
[structuralism]{.underline} of this account [has **immense power** as a
means of mapping forms of injustice and indignity as well as strategies
of resistance and refusal]{.underline}, and Wolfe is careful to show how
transmutations of the logic of elimination are complex, variable,
discontinuous and uneven. [Yet, in seeking to **elucidate the logic of
elimination** as the **overarching historical force** guiding
settler-native relations there is an **operational weakness** in the
theory, whereby such a logic is **simply there**, **omnipresent** and
**manifest** even when (and perhaps especially when) it **appears not to
be**; the settler colonial studies scholar need only **read it into a
situation** or **context**. It]{.underline} thus [**hurtles from the
past** to the **present** into the **future**, never to be fully
extinguished until the native is, or until history itself ends. There is
thus a **powerful ontological**]{.underline} (if not metaphysical)
**[dimension]{.underline}** to Wolfe's account, [where there is such
thing as a '**settler will**' that **inherently desires the elimination
of the native** and the distinction between the settler and native **can
only ever be categorical**, founded as it is on the 'primal binarism of
the frontier']{.underline} (2013a: 258). It is here that the differences
between earlier settler colonial scholarship on Israel-Palestine and the
recent settler colonial turn come into clearest view. While Jamal
Hilal's (1976) Marxist account of the conflict, for instance, engaged
Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in terms of their relations to the
means of production, Wolfe's account brings its own ontology: the
bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction becomes that of settler/native, and
the class struggle the struggle between [settler]{.underline}, who
[seeks to **destroy** and **replace the native**, and
native]{.underline}, who **[can only ever push back]{.underline}**.
Indeed, [if the settler colonial paradigm views history in]{.underline}
similar [teleological terms]{.underline} to the Marxist framework, [[it
**does not offer** the]{.mark} same [hopeful]{.mark} vision of a
liberated [future]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, [[settler colonialism
has **only one story**]{.mark} **to tell**---'[either **total victory**
or]{.mark} **total [failure]{.mark}**[']{.mark}]{.underline} (Veracini,
2007).

Veracini's attempt to disaggregate different forms of settler
decolonisation is revealing of the difficulties that come along with
this zero-sum perspective. It is significant to note that beyond settler
evacuation (which may decolonise territory, he cautions, but not
necessarily relationships) the picture he paints is a relatively bleak
one. For Veracini (2011: 5), claims for decolonisation from Indigenous
peoples in settler societies can take two broad forms: an 'anticolonial
rhetoric expressing a demand for indigenous sovereign independence and
self-determination... and an "ultra"-colonial one that seeks a
reconstituted partnership with the \[settler state\] and advocates a
return to a relatively more respectful middle ground and "treaty"
conditions'. While both, he suggests, are tempting strategies in the
struggle for change, though 'ultimately ineffective against settler
colonial structures of domination' (2011: 5), it is the latter strategy
that invites Veracini's most scathing assessment. As he writes,

under settler colonial conditions the independent polity is the settler
polity and sanctioning the equal rights of indigenous peoples has
historically been used as a powerful weapon in the denial of indigenous
entitlement and in the enactment of various forms of coercive
assimilation. This decolonisation actually enhances the subjection of
indigenous peoples... it is at best irrelevant and at worst detrimental
to indigenous peoples in settler societies (2011: 6-7).

The 'primal binarism of the frontier' plays a particularly ambivalent
role in Veracini's (2011: 6) formulation, where [the **categorical
distinction** between settler and native **obstructs** the 'possibility
of a genuinely decolonised relationship']{.underline} (by virtue of its
lopsidedness) [yet is a **necessary political strategy** to **guard
against the absorption** of Indigenous people into the settler fold,
which would **represent settler colonialism's final
victory**]{.underline}. [The battle here is between a 'settler
colonialism \[that\] is designed to produce a fundamental discontinuity
as its "logic of elimination" runs its course until it actually
extinguishes the settler colonial relation' and an anti-colonial
struggle that '**must aim to keep the settler-indigenous relationship
going**']{.underline} (2011: 7). In other words, [the categorical
distinction produced by the frontier **must be maintained in order to
struggle against its effects**]{.underline}. Given the lack of options
presented to Indigenous peoples by Veracini (2014: 315), his conclusion
that settler decolonisation demands a 'radical, post-settler colonial
passage' is perhaps not surprising \-- although he has 'no suggestion as
to how this may be achieved and \[is\] pessimistic about its
feasibility'.

Scholars have long reckoned with the ambivalence of the settler colonial
situation, which is simultaneously colonial and postcolonial, colonising
and decolonising (Curthoys, 1999: 288). [Given the generally
dreadful]{.underline} Fourth World [circumstances facing many Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} in settler societies, [it **could be argued** that
there is good reason for]{.underline} such **[pessimism]{.underline}**.
The settler colonial paradigm, in this sense, offers an important
caution against celebratory narratives of progress. Wolfe (1994), it
must be recalled, wrote the original articulation of his thesis
precisely against the idea of 'historical rupture' that dominated in
Australia post-Mabo, and was thus as much a scholarly intervention as it
was a political challenge to the idea of Australia having broken with
its colonial past. [**Nonetheless**, the **[fatalism]{.mark}** of the
settler colonial paradigm]{.underline}---whereby decolonisation is by
and large put beyond the realms of
possibility---[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} seen it [[come under]{.mark}
**considerable [critique]{.mark}** [for **reifying settler colonialism**
as a]{.mark} transhistorical [meta-structure where]{.mark} colonial
[relations]{.mark} of domination [are
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Macoun & Strakosch, 2013: 435;
Snelgrove et al., 2014: 9). [[Not only does]{.underline}]{.mark} Wolfe's
[[ontology **erase contingency**]{.mark}, **heterogeneity** [and]{.mark}
(crucially) **[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Merlan, 1997; Rowse,
2014), [[but]{.mark} its polarised framework effectively '[**puts
politics to death**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Svirsky, 2014: 327). In
response to such critiques, Wolfe (2013a: 213) suggests that 'the
repudiation of binarism' may just represent a 'settler perspective'.
However, as Elizabeth Povinelli (1997: 22) has astutely shown, it is in
this regard that [the **totalising logic** of]{.underline} Wolfe's
[structure of invasion **rests on a disciplinary gesture** where '**any
discussion** which **does not insist** on the polarity of the
\[settler\] colonial project' is **assimilationist**, worse still,
**genocidal** in effect if not intent. **Any attempt** to 'explore the
**dialogical** or **hybrid nature** of colonial subjectivity'---which
would entail **working beyond the bounds of absolute polarity**---is
**disciplined as complicit** in the settler colonial project itself,
leaving 'the **only nonassimilationist position** one that **adheres
strictly** and **solely** to a **critique** of \[settler\] state
discourse'. [This]{.mark} gesture not only **disallows the possibility
of counter-publics** and **strategic alliances** (even limited ones),
but also **[comes]{.mark} dangerously [close]{.mark}** [to '**resistance
as acquiescence**']{.mark} insofar as [the]{.mark} settler colonial
studies [scholar may **malign the structures**]{.mark} **set in play**
by settler colonialism, [but]{.mark} **only [from a safe
distance]{.mark} unsullied by the messiness** of ambivalences and
contradictions of settler and Native subjectivities and relations.
**Opposition** is thus left as our **only option**, but]{.underline}, as
we know from critical anti-colonial and postcolonial scholarship,
[opposition]{.underline} in itself [is **not
decolonisation**]{.underline}.

In popular culture, when conventionality is not being called a
homogenizing threat to people's sovereignty and singularity it is seen
as a true expression of something both deep and simple in the human... I
span the term's normative and aesthetic senses and claim that [the mass
mediation of]{.underline} desires in women's genres constructs a deep
affinity between them" 3. A genre "mediates what is singular, in the
details, and general about the subject. It is a form of aesthetic
expectation with porous boundaries [allowing complex audience
identifications: it locates real life in the affective
capacity to bracket many kinds of structural and historical
antagonism on behalf of finding a way to connect with the feeling of
belonging to a larger world]{.underline}, however aesthetically
mediated" 4. "To call an identity like a sexual identity a genre is to
think about it as something repeated, detailed, and stretched while
retaining its intelligibility, its capacity to remain readable or
audible across the field of all its variations. For femininity [to be a
genre like an aesthetic one means that it is a structure of conventional
expectation that people rely on to provide certain kinds of affective
intensities and assurances"]{.underline} 4. Importantly, for Berlant,
this means that 'performativity' often means variations within
convention, rahter than "dramas of potentially frame-breaking
alternativity" 4. The swerves a genre takes as "transgressions" on the
way to the ultimate end are often part of the convention: "women's
culture always contains episodes of refusal and creative contravention
to feminine normativity, even as it holds tightly to some versions of
the imaginable conventional good life in love" 4.
"[The]{.underline} gender-marked [texts of]{.underline} women's popular
culture [cultivate fantasies of vague belonging as an alleviation
of]{.underline} what is hard to manage in the lived
real [--]{.underline} [social antagonisms,
exploitation,]{.underline} compromised intimacies, the attrition of
life... one of the main utopias is normativity itself... an aspirational
site of rest and [recognition in and by a social world]{.underline}" 5.
"An intimate public operates when a market opens up to a bloc of
consumers, claiming to circulate texts and things that express those
people's particular core interests and desires... participants... feel
as though it expresses what is common among them, a subjective likeness

and actions... seems to confirm the sense that even before there was a
market addressed to them, there existed a world of strangers who
would [be emotionally literate in each other's experience of
power]{.underline}, intimacy, desire[,]{.underline} [and
discontent,]{.underline} with all that entails... ['Women's culture' was
the first such mass-marketed intimate public]{.underline} in the United
States of significant scale" 5. "As long as they have had a public
sphere, [bourgeois white women writers have mobilized fantasies
of what black and working-class interiority based on suffering must feel
like in order to find a language for their own]{.underline} more
privileged [suffering]{.underline} at the hands of other women, men, and
callous institutions \[The Help!\]... [Compassionate
liberalism is,]{.underline} at best, [a kind of sandpaper on the surface
of the racist monument whose structural and
economic solidity endures: in the intimate sphere]{.underline} of
femininity [a kind of soft supremacy rooted in compassion and coercive
identification]{.underline} wants to dissolve all that structure...
while [busily exoticizing and diminishing the inconvenient and the
noncompliant...]{.underline} But... intimate spheres feel like ethical
places..." 6. \[vs Mad Men?\] "[The problem at hand is of naming what
appears when a collectivity is historically created by biopower, class
antagonism, nationalism, imperialism, and/or the law
and,]{.underline} at the same time, is engendered by an ongoing social
life [mediated by capital and organized by all kinds
of pleasure... Intimate publics elaborate themselves through a commodity
culture;]{.underline} have an osmotic relation to many modes of life;
and are [organized by fantasies of transcending]{.underline}" 8.
"Biopower has indeed reorganized individuals into populations deemed
incompetent to the privileges of citizenship... fields of historical
commonality that are at once specifically related to events... and to
what it was like back in the day" 9. "[A public is intimate when it
foregrounds affective and emotional attachments located in fantasies of
the common,]{.underline} the everyday, and a sense of ordinariness, a
space where the social world is [rich with]{.underline} anonymity
and [local recognitions]{.underline}... textually mediated: as Miriam
Hansen has argued, modern publics required stylistic strategies
and [modes of narration to absorb viewers into]{.underline} textually
constructed [positions of general subjectivity
that also served the]{.underline} historical [convergence of social and
economic objectives]{.underline} \[think Williams and [the code
and]{.underline} Mulvey and [the gaze]{.underline}\].... in mass
society, [what counts as collectivity has been a loosely
organized, market-structured juxtapolitical sphere of people attached to
each other by a sense that there is a common emotional
world]{.underline} available to those individuals who have been [marked
by the historical burden of being harshly treated]{.underline} in a
generic way... [a sense
of]{.underline} lateral [identification]{.underline}... revelations of
what is personal, regardless of how what is persona has itself been
threaded through mediating institutions and social hierarchy" 10 \[think
faceting!\] "Mass-mediated popular culture is always generating more
opportunities for fomenting a sense of focused belonging to an evolving
world in this intensely connected yet mediated way... Belonging to an
intimate public is therefore a condition of feeling general within a set
of porous constraints, and of feeling held or sustained by an evolving
sense of experience that confirms some homogeneity and elaborates social
distinctions" 13. Disappointment and fulfillment are "partners" in the
culture of women and love: "Each is central to the absorbing anxiety
that gets animated by having an object of desire" 13. In Lacanian terms,
"the loss of pleasure, then, can be defined as the insufferable
interruption of a repetition with which a lover has identified the
optimism of a fundamental attachment" 14. "Love is the gift that keeps
on giving when people can rely on reexperiencing their intimates'
fundamental sympathy with the project of repetition and recognition
\[importance of 'tomorrow'\]... Love is the gift that keeps on taking
for the same reason: the search for mirroring (desire) demands constant
improvisation (anxiety) and taking of accounts (disappointment)" 15.
When a success, this is called reciprocity. For Jacqueline Rose,
"anxiety is the core affect of femininity, which operates under an
imperative never to fail to stop working on itself" 16. "In women's
culture, normative femininity and aesthetic conventionality constitute
the real central couple, with the love plot as the vehicle for and
object of desire. Spivak's description of the 'concept/metaphor' that is
simultaneously descriptive and transformative is useful here... for not
changing, but adapting, propping the play of surface against a stubborn
demand to remain in proximity to the promise" 19. "For a woman committed
to romantic fantasies of love as reciprocity to break with the normative
emotional bargains is to threaten her participation in the good life
that seems to unfold from desire and to be maintained by ordinary
emotional labor. The sentimental bargain of femininity... receives her
own value back not only in the labor of recognition she performs but in
the sensual spectacle of its impacts. In this discursive field the
emotional labor of women places them at the center of the story of what
counts as life, regardless of what lives women actually live: the
conjuncture of family and romance so structures the emergence of modern
sexuality, with its conflation of sexual and emotional truths, and in
that nexus femininity marks the scene of the reproduction of life as a
project... to be proximate to this story of emotional centrality. The
circularity of the feminine project... is a perfect form, a sphere
infused with activities of ongoing circuits of attachment that can at
the same time look and feel like a zero" 19. \[think Joan Holloway
Harris\] "The mechanism of sentimental saturation of the intimate sphere
with materials and signs of consumer citizenship has been crucial to
what Mark Seltzer has called the 'pathological public sphere' of the
contemporary US... the sensationalism of the late 19th and early 20th
century. The Uncle Tom genealogy is notable precisely because its
sensationalism was a politically powerful suturing device of a bourgeois
revolutionary aesthetic" 20.

Suspicion can serve the critical objective of historicizing and
contextualizing seemingly abstract or neutral concepts such as
securitization or biopolitics, but here it transforms into [an
[essentialist argument]{.mark} that instead **[fixes]{.mark}** the
**[meaning]{.mark}** and character of words, concepts and theories
[across time and space. Characterized by]{.mark} a **[unidirectional
anticipation]{.mark}** of the future, such a view entails that
structural forms of injustice, such as epistemic racism, can be simply
presumed to follow every time]{.underline} the 'S-word' is uttered. As
an intellectual strategy, such a [[finalistic version]{.mark} of
suspicion [**does not serve** the field]{.mark} of critical security
studies **[well.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Indeed, Howell and
Richter-Montpetit fail to acknowledge that almost every empirical
'application' of securitization theory has involved a serious
rearticulation of its core concepts and their relations. These
[[rearticulations could]{.mark}, of course, [reproduce problematic
assumptions]{.mark} about race that taint the empirical analysis or
foreclose important avenues of inquiry, [but this is **not**]{.mark} a
matter that can be **[adjudicated in advance]{.mark}**. Nor is it true
that such [recuperative projects do]{.mark} not
[exist]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For example, Claudia Aradau's
(2004) radical rearticulation of desecuritization seems to avoid the
pitfalls Howell and Richter-Montpetit associate with the Copenhagen
School. Her work, as well as that of others, shows that thinking with a
theory often also involves thinking against that theory and illustrates
how new or more progressive interpretations often cannot exist without
prior ones.

In addition, [the [risk of **confirmation bias**]{.mark} -- the tendency
for an analyst to read selectively and overlook or exclude examples that
do not fit her or his assumptions -- [**looms large** in such
essentialist forms]{.mark} of suspicion.]{.underline} Despite
significant differences in tone, both Lene Hansen's (2020) rejoinder and
the response by Ole Wæver and Barry Buzan (2020) point out that Howell
and Richter-Montpetit's analysis of securitization theory suffers from
this methodological fallacy. Howell and Richter-Montpetit's critique of
Foucauldian security studies admittedly leaves more room for
recuperative readings,4 but at times runs up against similar problems.
For example, it is not evident on the basis of what criteria the field
of Foucauldian security studies is delineated, and at times it appears
set up in such a way as to corroborate pre-existing suspicions.5 To be
sure, [theories and concepts may at times come with heavy historical
baggage that overdetermines their meaning. Still, even then, the
[criticality of]{.mark} a [rearticulation depends not just on]{.mark}
the [theories]{.mark} and thinkers invoked, [but also]{.mark} on [what
such an **engagement forecloses or opens up.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
Suspicion is an indispensable part of critical theorizing but can also
unduly restrict productive engagements with prior work, including
critical security studies' own intellectual ancestry.
