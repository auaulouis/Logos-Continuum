# File Explanation

This is meant to supplement existing China files. Since much of the
internal link / impact work was done by other labs, this file focused on
a new link to China SOI. The plan strengthens US presence (predominately
commercial) in the Arctic, which is bad because it shifts our presence
away from Panama. China fill-in displaces or trades off directly with US
presence -- the impacts include leadership/hegemony/democracy. We tried
to organize some of the relevant work from other files at the bottom for
convenience.

Hemisphere---ranging from [retaking the Panama

undermining hemispheric stability, [legitimate [concerns about
**growing** Chinese influence]{.mark} over the canal **[demand]{.mark}**
Washington's [attention]{.mark}]{.underline} and warrant a measured,
diplomatic approach.

Intervention to sovereignty

The Panama Canal's origins and US intervention are inextricably
intertwined. After failed negotiations with Colombia, the United States
pivoted to support Panamanian independence in 1903, with President
Theodore Roosevelt employing "[gun boat
diplomacy](https://hamptonroadsnavalmuseum.blogspot.com/2015/09/uss-nashville-pg-7-and-building-of.html)"
to deter Colombian resistance to the movement. The reward for military
support and US recognition of the Republic of Panama was
the [Hay-Bunau-Varilla
Treaty](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/pan001.asp), which
granted the United States perpetual control over a ten-mile-wide canal
zone for [ten million
dollars](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/pan001.asp#art14) down
and \$250,000 a year. After considerable investment of
US [blood](https://www.history.com/news/panama-canal-construction-dangers) and [treasure](https://pancanal.com/en/end-of-the-construction/),
the US-built canal remains a remarkable engineering achievement and a
critical artery of global trade. However, the 1903 political arrangement
sowed deep-seated resentment over perceived infringements on Panamanian
sovereignty.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter championed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties,
aiming to foster goodwill and strengthen US-Panama relations. To secure
Senate ratification, two treaties were negotiated: one for transfer of
the canal by the turn of the millennium and the other to ensure
permanent neutrality. The Senate ratified the treaties by the [slimmest
of
margins](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/panama-canal#:~:text=The%20Senate%20ratified%20the%20Neutrality,for%20the%20Torrijos%2DCarter%20Treaties.).
On December 31, 1999, Panama assumed control of the canal.

[[The]{.mark} Panama [Canal is **vital** for]{.mark} global [shipping,
offering **unmatched** efficiency]{.mark} for trade between Asia and the
Americas' eastern ports]{.underline}. Alternatives such as overland
transport or navigating Cape Horn add significant distance, cost, and
environmental impact, while [[Arctic routes are **seasonal** and
**geopolitically constrained**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the most
reliable maritime link between the Atlantic and Pacific, [the canal
remains **irreplaceable**]{.underline}.

China's expanding influence

[[Trump's]{.mark} recent [comments]{.mark} on]{.underline} the Panama
Canal's [transit fees and Chinese influence]{.underline} have [[thrust
the canal to]{.mark} the [**forefront** of]{.mark} US [strategic
discourse. Chinese companies]{.mark}]{.underline} such as [Landbridge
Group](https://www.landbridge.com.hk/about.html) and the Hong
Kong-based [CK Hutchison
Holdings](https://www.ckh.com.hk/en/global/home.php) [now [[operate]{.mark}
ports](https://www.csis.org/analysis/key-decision-point-coming-panama-canal) [at
**both ends**]{.mark} of the canal]{.underline}. This [[presence raises
concerns about]{.mark} potential [**dual-use** infra]{.mark}structure
[and **strategic maneuvering**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly given
China's [deepening
ties](https://dialogue.earth/en/business/26121-belt-and-road-the-new-face-of-china-in-latin-america/) to
Latin America.

The United States wields significant economic leverage over Panama. As
the primary user of the canal and Panama's largest provider of foreign
direct investment---[\$3.8
billion](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-panama/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20provides%20more%20foreign%20direct%20investment,direct%20investment%20position%20of%20%243.8%20billion%20in%202022.) annually---the
United States can influence Panamanian decision making. Conversely, the
United States and its partners present few viable alternatives to
Chinese investment in the region, a reality unlikely to change in the
short term. Will Panama prioritize alignment with US interests to
safeguard this support, or will it risk economic repercussions by
favoring China and leveraging its control over this vital trade route?
Alternatively, could US economic retaliation, Panama's reaction, and
Chinese competition escalate tensions to the point that interventions
are warranted under the treaty?

[Transit
fees](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2641684-trump-panama-tiff-highlights-rising-transit-cost),
which are calculated using a universally applicable formula, have surged
in recent years. In part, these fee increases are a response to droughts
in 2023 and early 2024, which restricted the number of ships that could
transit the canal. Authorities raised fees to counteract revenue loss
from the transit restrictions. Nonetheless, if costs continue to rise,
and if China continues to expand its presence around the canal, then
there may be louder calls to resurrect the [Roosevelt
Corollary](https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Learn-About-TR/TR-Encyclopedia/Foreign-Affairs/Roosevelt-Corollary) to
the Monroe Doctrine. This corollary asserts the United States' right to
intervene in the region to ensure stability and prevent foreign
interference.

The legal framework

Trump's claim that the Panama Canal Treaties were a "[bad
part](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/trump-jimmy-carter-panama-canal-00196862)" of
the Carter legacy is a simplification of the nuanced legal and
geopolitical complexities surrounding the Panama Canal. The [Permanent
Neutrality
Treaty](https://pancanal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/neutrality-treaty.pdf) imposed
obligations on both parties. An argument can certainly be made that
Panama has, or is close to, breaching some of its treaty obligations:

[Transit
fees](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rlnks/11936.htm): Panama
committed to ensuring that tolls and related charges for transit would
remain "just, reasonable, equitable, and consistent with international
law." US
Senate [consent](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rlnks/11936.htm) to
the treaty was predicated on an understanding that fee-setting would
consider US interests, including factors such as the feasibility of
alternative transportation modes and the goal of maximizing US
international commerce. While the shipping fees may be flag-agnostic,
they have a disproportionate impact on US shipping. Interpretations of
reasonableness may vary but it is clear that Trump views current fees
paid by US companies as
"[exorbitant](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/politics/panama-canal-history-trump/index.html)."

[Neutrality](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rlnks/11936.htm): Both
parties agreed to maintain the canal's permanent neutrality with
particular emphasis on ensuring access for military vessels.
[[China's]{.mark} economic [control]{.mark}]{.underline} on both sides
of the canal [[raises]{.mark} concerns about]{.underline} the
[[potential for **rapid militarization** and]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[ability to control canal **access**. Panama's willingness to
**relinquish**]{.mark} critical economic [control]{.mark} of
strategically significant areas]{.underline} and infrastructure---a
hallmark of [China's Belt and Road
Initiative](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3264659/china-belt-and-road-initiative-outpaces-us-influence/) strategy---[[casts
doubt on]{.mark} Panama's]{.underline} resolve and [[capacity to]{.mark}
effectively **[safeguard]{.mark}** the canal's
[neutrality]{.mark}]{.underline} as agreed to in the treaty. The costs
of a neutrality breach are significant enough that the United States may
be justified in taking preemptive action.

The rhetoric, while appealing to nationalist sentiments, risks
undermining decades of diplomacy, established international law, and
US-Panama relations. However, [[Washington cannot afford to **overlook**
China's]{.mark} growing [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly
[[given]{.mark} the canal's strategic [importance in the US-China
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}---China ranks as
its [second-largest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710499/share-cargo-volume-panama-canal-by-country/#:~:text=In%20the%20fiscal%20year%202021,through%20the%20Canal%20that%20year.) customer.
[[Trump]{.mark}'s statements]{.underline} likely [[aim to]{.mark}

[[China's]{.mark} latent [choke point on]{.mark} the US - the [Panama
Canal]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} is, of course, that Chinese control over
the entry ports to the canal can lead to something akin to a [[naval
blockade]{.mark} of the entire canal,]{.underline} but without the
apparent use of military force. Already in 1998, US Admiral Thomas
Moorer alerted the US Senate to the possibility [that [Chinese port
operations in Panama]{.mark} could [block American military supplies and
warships in]{.mark} case of a [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. According
to him, such an operation [could [also affect]{.mark} the possibility of
supplying [deployed forces]{.mark} in the Mediterranean Sea and the
Persian Gulf, [and]{.mark} as a consequence **[lead to serious
constraints to]{.mark}** their **[combat
readiness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.71

In 1999, US Senator Helen Chenoweth promoted US House of Representative
Joint Resolution 77 to warn the US Senate about the increasing Chinese
control of maritime ports and military presence in the Panama Canal.
Continuing her argument, she said it was necessary to invoke the
violation of Article V of the Neutrality Treaty, and to move for a
nullification of the Treaty. Article V of this Treaty states that only
the Republic of Panama maintain military forces and installations to
defend the Panama Canal.72 In consequence, she argued, Hutchison Whampoa
cannot be regarded as anything but a corporate cutout of the PLA.73

Similarly, in 1999, US Senator Trent Lott warned that [[China]{.mark}
through Hutchison Whampoa was [endanger]{.mark}ing [US national security
for]{.mark} gaining [port control]{.mark}]{.underline} through its
presence at both ends of the Panama Canal.74 Moreover, in 1999, Howard
Phillips, the then Chairman of the Conservative Caucus, an American
public policy advocacy group, defended the idea of canceling the
Hutchison Whampoa contract to administer the Pacific and Caribbean ports
at both entries to the Panama Canal and the [[growing influence of
Communist]{.mark} Chinese economic [influence in
Panama]{.mark}]{.underline}. In consequence, he argued about the need to
negotiate the restoration of the US military in the Panama Canal to
prevent, for example, an act to Gatun dam, which [[could incapacitate
the Panama Canal and **affect US military
readiness**]{.underline}]{.mark}.75

Remarkably, not even the US intelligence community seems to have
understood the different dimensions of China's threat to the United
States in the canal zone.76 Ironically, in 1999, the US Department of
Defense claimed that Hutchison Whampoa was not a threat to US national
security.77 Interestingly, and conversely, the commanding officer of
USSOUTHCOM General Laura Richardson warned that [[Chinese companies
could be **weaponized and quickly be utilized as military capabilities**
in the Panama Canal]{.mark} when necessary.78]{.underline}

That the [[security]{.mark} in and [around the canal]{.mark} has been
allowed to be [compromised in this manner has **ramifications not only
in the global context, but also in the regional**]{.mark}. As a result,
[any naval blockade by China]{.mark} could [lead to military
actions]{.mark} in Panama]{.underline}. Based on the Neutrality Treaty,
the United States of America has the right to take military actions to
reopen the Canal or restore the operations of the Canal, when
necessary.79

Consequently, it is necessary for us to go a bit further and to reflect
on the magnitude of the hold that China currently has over the canal. We
argue that this hold has four very important modalities and that China
operates her companies in a very strategic way in order to increase its
grip over the canal. The first is through its non-commitment to the
Panama Canal treaties in effect today, while the second is through
China's deep economic ties with Panama. The third and fourth aspects are
intertwined in the sense that the Chinese companies operating the ports
in and around the canal are closely connected to the PLA.

First, [[China's legal framework could **jeopardize US national
security**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the coming future because China has
not signed the 1977 Neutrality Treaty.80 Article II of this Treaty holds
that the neutrality concerns the transit of vessels from all countries,
and under all conditions, and finally that the Isthmus of Panama shall
not be targeted [[in an armed conflict]{.mark}.81 However, and this
could perhaps be the core of the problem at hand, China, as the only
permanent member of the Security Council, has not signed this Treaty.
China's reluctance to recognize the Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty is an
issue to consider for the integrity of the Panama Canal and the region.
As a result, [China is not legally bound to respect Panama Canal
Neutrality in case of]{.mark} armed conflict or
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. In April 2022, Panamanian officials traveled
to China to formally request a negotiating table between Panama and
China to convince China to sign the Neutrality Treaty.82 Moreover,
[[China's strategic alliance with like-minded states]{.mark} could lead
countries [to]{.mark} cause **[miscalc]{.mark}**ulated [security
risks]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. For instance, while China has
provided training for the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (CRAF) to
suppress mass riots, it has also provided Venezuela with political and
economic support.83 Also, in 2021, United States warned Cuba and
Venezuela about the danger for countries in the Americas due to the
possible arrival of Iranian vessels that were allegedly carrying
weapons.84

Second, [[China's increasing economic relation with Panama could evolve
into]{.mark} even closer integration of the Panama Canal into the global
network known as [China's New Silk Road]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2014,
and as mentioned above, a Chinese diplomatic and economic delegation
visited the PCA to express its interest in designing, constructing, and
financing a Fourth Set of Locks in the Panama Canal.85 Thus, when Panama
and China formalized diplomatic relations, the legal pathway for direct
involvement in the Panama Canal was furthered even more through
bilateral agreements. To this effect, China-Panama Bilateral Agreement
XIX states that both countries, in agreement with China's BRI and MSR,
"will conduct cooperation and exchanges of infrastructure connectivity
in areas of mutual interest, such as roads, railways, bridges, civil
aviation, ports, canals, and energy."86 According to this agreement, any
integration should be through information sharing, personnel exchange
and training, joint research, and capacity building.

As of 2022, the PCA is analyzing the construction of the Fourth Set of
Locks, which is a vital future project for the Panama Canal. However,
China's interest in the Comparative Strategy 479 Fourth Set of Locks of
the Panama Canal seems that it slowed down but considering China's
long-term planning is a matter of time to reactive conversations about
this important project. However, contrary to China's interest on this
project, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is apparently
[lag]{.mark}ging [behind China]{.mark}]{.underline} because no American
business or diplomatic delegations have publicly announced their
interest on the Fourth Sect of Lock, which is a vital need for the
Panama Canal in the future.

Thirdly, due to [[low trust in Chinese ports in Panama]{.mark}, US
warships tend to avoid those ports, a fact that seriously
**[hampers]{.mark} the [ability to execute]{.mark}
[operations]{.mark}**. In that regard, the PATSA Port is most common
suggested port [for US warships]{.mark}. In 2019, US Admiral Gary
Roughead argued that US warship regularly do not call to Chinese ports
due to the risk that [American cybersecurity systems]{.mark} could be
[at risk]{.mark} of being exposed [to **malicious commercial port
information-technology**]{.mark} (IT) [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.87
Without knowing the exact circumstances leading to US Navy guided
missile destroyer USS Zumwalt suffering a propulsion failure in 2016
while crossing the Panama Canal to the Pacific Ocean (actually requiring
it to be towed to the PATSA Port),88 security in the canal must be
regarded as an important aspect of US national security.

Fourth, [[China's grip]{.mark} through its multinational companies [in
the Panama Canal is]{.mark} still [a matter of
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to former commander of US
Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), General Stephen Lyons, COSCO
performs sealift as a sort of out-sourced logistical support to PLA
operations.89 COSCO is one of the most prominent Chinese companies in
charge of port operations and international maritime logistics with
connections that, at least according to what some sources claim, has
paramilitary capabilities to support PLA operations.90 As noted by the
2022 Report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's
Republic of China, **[[China actively pursues military-civil
fusion]{.underline}]{.mark}** through state-owned companies like
COSCO.91 It should be noted that COSCO, with its strong ties to China's
military industries, provides logistics and supply support for PLA's
operations worldwide.92

The relationship between PLA and Chinese companies is an interesting and
important topic in itself. According to some sources, the
[[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark} on \"the
**[[biggest]{.underline}]{.mark}** peacetime **[[naval build-up the
world has ever seen]{.underline}]{.mark}**," and while doing so has
involved the private sector in a way that in China is referred to as a
"military-civil fusion." In that sense, many Chinese commercial
entities, extending to and including shipping companies, are said to
form "a key part of the integrated military-civilian logistics system."
The PLA Navy (PLAN) may at the moment have only have one overseas
military base, in Djibouti, but "replenishment and other logistical
support is in theory available wherever Cosco operates," and its "global
network \[...\] allows the \[PLAN\] to resolve logistics and supply
issues outside China's immediate maritime periphery."93

It should also, in this context, be noted that the PCA has two important
boards. The most important is the Directive Board with its 11 Panamanian
members oversees establishing policies for operations and supervising
Panama Canal management. While they serve nine years each of them, ten
are appointed by the executive branch and one by the legislative
branch.94 The other board is the Advisory Board, which serves as a
consulting body to make recommendations for the Directive Board and the
Administration of the Panama Canal. The Advisory Board has 16 foreign
members from different sectors who are appointed by the Directive Board
to serve five years. Not surprisingly, China has two members in the
Advisory Board. Chee Chen Tung 480 Y. E. CHAVEZ RODRIGUEZ AND M. MOHLIN
who has served for 23 years since 1999 and Wang Haimin from COSCO who
has served three years since 2019.95

Likewise, China's port control in Panama until 2047 is yet another
issue. In that regard, Hutchison Whampoa, which controls Hutchison
Panama Ports, has Chinese businessman Li Ka-shing as its senior
advisor.96 Since 1999, Li Ka-shing has known for the US Congress for his
alleged links to the PLA and the Chinese Communist Party.97 Although
those claims have not been corroborated, Xi Jinping's new strategy
requires all Chinese, be it companies or individuals, to be loyal to,
and support Chinese Communist Party policies. Therefore, it was not
surprising that Li Ka-shing showed public support for China's new legal
framework for Hong Kong in 2020 despite concern of western countries for
[[China's **repressing policies**]{.underline}]{.mark} to ban sedition,
secession [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} subversion.98 Still, there is not
clarity how Chinese **[[Communist]{.underline}]{.mark}** Party's
**[[pressures]{.underline}]{.mark}** will [[affect]{.mark}]{.underline}
Hutchison Whampoa's decision-making process in relation to the [[Panama
Canal]{.mark}; however, attention should be devoted]{.underline}.

Canal's [transit fees and Chinese influence]{.underline} have [[thrust
the canal to]{.mark} the [**forefront** of]{.mark} US [strategic
discourse. Chinese companies]{.mark}]{.underline} such as [Landbridge
Group](https://www.landbridge.com.hk/about.html) and the Hong
Kong-based [CK Hutchison
Holdings](https://www.ckh.com.hk/en/global/home.php) [now [[operate]{.mark}
ports](https://www.csis.org/analysis/key-decision-point-coming-panama-canal) [at
**both ends**]{.mark} of the canal]{.underline}. This [[presence raises
concerns about]{.mark} potential [**dual-use** infra]{.mark}structure
[and **strategic maneuvering**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly given
China's [deepening
ties](https://dialogue.earth/en/business/26121-belt-and-road-the-new-face-of-china-in-latin-america/) to
Latin America.

The United States wields significant economic leverage over Panama. As
the primary user of the canal and Panama's largest provider of foreign
direct investment---[\$3.8
billion](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-panama/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20provides%20more%20foreign%20direct%20investment,direct%20investment%20position%20of%20%243.8%20billion%20in%202022.) annually---the
United States can influence Panamanian decision making. Conversely, the
United States and its partners present few viable alternatives to
Chinese investment in the region, a reality unlikely to change in the
short term. Will Panama prioritize alignment with US interests to
safeguard this support, or will it risk economic repercussions by
favoring China and leveraging its control over this vital trade route?
Alternatively, could US economic retaliation, Panama's reaction, and
Chinese competition escalate tensions to the point that interventions
are warranted under the treaty?

[Transit
fees](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2641684-trump-panama-tiff-highlights-rising-transit-cost),
which are calculated using a universally applicable formula, have surged
in recent years. In part, these fee increases are a response to droughts
in 2023 and early 2024, which restricted the number of ships that could
transit the canal. Authorities raised fees to counteract revenue loss
from the transit restrictions. Nonetheless, if costs continue to rise,
and if China continues to expand its presence around the canal, then
there may be louder calls to resurrect the [Roosevelt
Corollary](https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Learn-About-TR/TR-Encyclopedia/Foreign-Affairs/Roosevelt-Corollary) to
the Monroe Doctrine. This corollary asserts the United States' right to
intervene in the region to ensure stability and prevent foreign
interference.

The legal framework

Trump's claim that the Panama Canal Treaties were a "[bad
part](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/07/congress/trump-jimmy-carter-panama-canal-00196862)" of
the Carter legacy is a simplification of the nuanced legal and
geopolitical complexities surrounding the Panama Canal. The [Permanent
Neutrality
Treaty](https://pancanal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/neutrality-treaty.pdf) imposed
obligations on both parties. An argument can certainly be made that
Panama has, or is close to, breaching some of its treaty obligations:

[Transit
fees](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rlnks/11936.htm): Panama
committed to ensuring that tolls and related charges for transit would
remain "just, reasonable, equitable, and consistent with international
law." US
Senate [consent](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rlnks/11936.htm) to
the treaty was predicated on an understanding that fee-setting would
consider US interests, including factors such as the feasibility of
alternative transportation modes and the goal of maximizing US
international commerce. While the shipping fees may be flag-agnostic,
they have a disproportionate impact on US shipping. Interpretations of
reasonableness may vary but it is clear that Trump views current fees
paid by US companies as
"[exorbitant](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/politics/panama-canal-history-trump/index.html)."

[Neutrality](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/rlnks/11936.htm): Both
parties agreed to maintain the canal's permanent neutrality with
particular emphasis on ensuring access for military vessels.
[[China's]{.mark} economic [control]{.mark}]{.underline} on both sides
of the canal [[raises]{.mark} concerns about]{.underline} the
[[potential for **rapid militarization** and]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[ability to control canal **access**. Panama's willingness to
**relinquish**]{.mark} critical economic [control]{.mark} of
strategically significant areas]{.underline} and infrastructure---a
hallmark of [China's Belt and Road
Initiative](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3264659/china-belt-and-road-initiative-outpaces-us-influence/) strategy---[[casts
doubt on]{.mark} Panama's]{.underline} resolve and [[capacity to]{.mark}
effectively **[safeguard]{.mark}** the canal's
[neutrality]{.mark}]{.underline} as agreed to in the treaty. The costs
of a neutrality breach are significant enough that the United States may
be justified in taking preemptive action.

The rhetoric, while appealing to nationalist sentiments, risks
undermining decades of diplomacy, established international law, and
US-Panama relations. However, [[Washington cannot afford to **overlook**
China's]{.mark} growing [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly
[[given]{.mark} the canal's strategic [importance in the US-China
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}---China ranks as
its [second-largest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710499/share-cargo-volume-panama-canal-by-country/#:~:text=In%20the%20fiscal%20year%202021,through%20the%20Canal%20that%20year.) customer.

#### Expanded Chinese presence over the Canal causes democratic backsliding

and head of the Future of Venezuela Initiative at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies; Henry; associate fellow with the
Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies;
"Exporting Autocracy China's Role in Democratic Backsliding in Latin
America and the Caribbean" CSIS; 2/15;
https://www.csis.org/analysis/exporting-autocracy\]

**LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean**

China has proven adept at using this perception---and the United States'
comparative lack of a substantial presence in citizen security
efforts---to bolster its ties with national police forces.34
[[China]{.mark} has [conduct]{.mark}ed at least a dozen bilateral
[exchanges]{.mark} between senior police leadership [in LAC]{.mark} and
its own internal security services, and it has led at least 10 trainings
for police forces throughout the region.]{.underline}35 Especially
concerning is the fact that [China has engaged in several **capacity-
building activities** with police forces accused of **gross human rights
abuses**]{.underline}. This includes the Cuban police, responsible for
the suppression of mass protests in the summer of 2021, as well as the
Nicaraguan National Police, a force which China has delivered arms and
equipment to and which is under international sanction for its role in
brutally crushing popular demonstrations starting in 2018.36 Just as
China often serves as a lender of last resort to countries isolated from
global financial or business markets, [so too is it rapidly emerging as
a **security partner for authoritarian regimes,** willing to help
augment the capabilities of these governments to maintain control over
their populations through surveillance and brute force
alike]{.underline}.37

[China's trade and investment strategy has also paid dividends in the
security and defense space, most notably in the form of China's control
of port infrastructure throughout the hemisphere.]{.underline}
[[Maritime ports]{.mark} owned or [operated by China]{.mark} often
[serve]{.mark} dual civilian and **[military
uses]{.mark}**]{.underline}.38 They are [[instrumental nodes of
trade]{.mark} and commerce in peacetime, but [in]{.mark} moments of
crisis or [conflict, they could **provide an array of military
advantages.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Most directly, PRC-built ports around
the world have been built to specifications, particularly the berth of
docking spaces, allowing warships to dock and conduct resupply. [Such
[capabilities are **essential**]{.mark}, as the PLA looks to transform
itself from a force with limited regional power-projection capabilities
[to a military capable of global expeditionary operations with a **true
"blue water" navy.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Outside of directly supplying ships, however, [[China's grip over key
LAC ports is a **powerful intelligence-gathering
tool.**]{.underline}]{.mark}39 [[Port operators have access to
**critical data** on]{.mark} the origins, destinations, and types of
[cargo moving through their docks: **vital information for the PRC to
understand** supply chain shifts, demand for certain types of resources,
and, in the case of ports **along maritime chokepoints like the Panama
Canal**]{.mark} or Strait of Magellan, [the location of military vessels
en route from Atlantic to Pacific.]{.mark} Crucially[, this form of
influence **does not require China to have an active military presence
in the Western Hemisphere,**]{.mark}]{.underline} a development which
would surely inflame tensions with the United States and even backfire
in terms of China's relationship with the region. Instead, leveraging
this data would simply require invocation of the National Intelligence
Law to compel port operators to turn over defense-relevant data to
Beijing, thereby granting China a passive capability close to the
epicenter of U.S. military activity.40

China has made additional forays into forms of engagement traditionally
thought of as defense cooperation. Amid Russian defense industrial
shortfalls, China has surged to become the world's fifth-largest arms
supplier, with countries in LAC such as Bolivia and Venezuela purchasing
substantial quantities of Chinese arms already.41 The recent row over
Argentina's consideration of the JF-17, a joint Pakistani-Chinese
fighter jet, for its air force illustrates the growing efforts by China
to internationalize its arms industry. This also includes professional
military education, where China has been making strides to displace the
United States from its long-held role as primary source of foreign
training and assistance to LAC militaries.42 China has pursued a
concerted strategy in this regard to overmatch the United States in
quantity (though certainly not quality, for the time being) of training
provided. Whereas U.S. service academies may have billets for just a
handful of officers from a given LAC country, institutions like the
China National Defense University will accept delegations of a dozen
officers or more for instruction, often centered around sectors of
particular import to the PLA such as cybersecurity.43 Furthermore, this
professional military education is essential for identifying and
cultivating talent among junior officers, many of whom will eventually
Ryan C. Berg and Henry Ziemer \| 8 rise to senior positions in their
home militaries where they may be in positions to shape opinion and
policy toward the PRC.

Accordingly, while China's security and defense engagement has a long
way to go before it achieves the same level of maturity as its economic
efforts, expansion in this sector is potentially even more concerning
from a U.S. perspective.

Propagation and Protection

This report hypothesizes that [[China's engagement in LAC **encourages
democratic backsliding**]{.mark} along two key directions: [propagation
of authoritarian principles and protection of backsliding governments
from the consequences of their actions.]{.mark} This [enables
**authoritarian**]{.mark} **or semi- authoritarian [regimes]{.mark}** to
persist in the face of external---usually regional---pressure to reform.
Propagation refers to the means by which China seeks to encourage the
adoption of authoritarian political systems through its international
relations. In this regard, it is perhaps the most misunderstood vector
through which China contributes to democratic backsliding.]{.underline}
Indeed, China's engagement across LAC suggests that it does not
condition its engagement on whether a country is democratic or
autocratic. Yet even if the PRC is agnostic as to the types of regimes
it engages with, this does not mean that Beijing does not prefer certain
types of governments and would like to these see those types of regimes
proliferate throughout the region. Indeed, as a number of scholars of
great power politics and democracy alike have argued, states
consistently seek to sow their own governance models well beyond their
borders. Kevin Narizny, for instance, contends that the spread of
democracy throughout the world is conditioned upon Anglo-American
primacy within the international system, as both the United Kingdom and
later United States sought to promote their political models abroad
among their colonies, clients, and allies.81

While under Deng Xiaoping, China pursued a strategy known famously as
"biding time" and "hiding strength," this policy has changed drastically
under Xi Jinping. Whereas China was once reticent to admit there was a
"China model," it has recently become more vocal about its domestic
model as an alternative to Western liberal democracy. This forms the
basis for the PRC's "discursive competition," which takes explicit aim
at concepts such as international civil and political rights while
promoting the primacy of collective rights in line with the CCP's
centralized and state-driven model for economic and social
development.82 China has promoted its discursive competition in LAC,
most visibly in reports from individuals who have attended trainings
hosted by the PRC. Journalists, for instance, have noted that the
Chinese trainings encourage favorable coverage of the state, while in
the military dimension, [[SOUTHCOM has reported that]{.mark} at least
one of [China's trainings]{.mark} has [sought to discourage participants
from seeing the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as an effective security
partner.]{.mark}]{.underline}83

The GSI perhaps best embodies China's evolving perception of its role in
world affairs.84 The initiative professes to merge questions of domestic
and international security, "coordinating between China's domestic
security and the common security of the world."85 As one analyst notes,
the GSI seeks "security at home, influence abroad."86 Yet while the GSI
espouses a universal vision, the flavor of implementation is decidedly
in line with the CCP model of social control and, according to the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, "provides a classical Chinese
solution" to the problems of global instability.87 Indeed, China's
contributions to civil security in the hemisphere have stressed mass
surveillance and the proliferation of Chinese overseas police stations
and PSCs. China's international policing activities have similarly been
used not only to crack down on criminal organizations but to engage in
transnational repression by capturing and repatriating dissidents and
critics of the CCP abroad.88 [Expanding this public security approach to
the world risks exporting a similar model of restricted civil and
political rights, as well as the accretion of power in the hands of
governments.]{.underline} However, propagation has its limits. It does
not imply that China is actively and constantly seeking to convert the
countries it interacts with to autocracy. Indeed, the bulk of China's
engagement with LAC is filtered through the lens of economic interest.
But propagation does not require active intent to transpire, and many
countries have seen their democratic health and political stability
thrown into tumult as an unintended consequence of engaging with China.
Political economist Albert Hirschman has argued that trade ties between
countries over time can foster alignment among the foreign policy
systems of the trading countries.89 Given China's impressive role in
trade with the region, it is reasonable to see how LAC countries might
gradually mold themselves to become amenable to Beijing's vision of
world order, even without the CCP expressing a clear preference for a
certain regime type. At the sub-national level, for instance, the
presence of PRC companies can fuel corruption among local mayors and
governors, who use revenues and funds extracted from foreign firms to
remain in power.90 Chinese firms do not necessarily intend to undermine
local democracy; rather, they may merely wish to have productive
relations with the political power brokers responsible for regulatory
compliance and security near their operations.

The unintended consequence of this, however, [can be the [exacerbation
of]{.mark} an acute **[crisis of democracy]{.mark}** at the local level
in many countries.]{.underline}91 Certainly, even if China has no
interest in spreading its political model, [certain individuals within
the region do have an interest in mimicking the PRC.]{.underline} From
business leaders who marvel at the rapid growth of China's economy, to
public safety officials searching for answers to crime and violence, to
elected officials eager to cement their legacies with China-financed
development projects, the notion that China presents a model of
governance worthy of replicating has spread in the past two decades.92
Perhaps the best summation of this sentiment comes from Venezuelan
governor and Maduro ally Rafael Lacava, who on a November 2023 visit to
Shanghai stated, "We are in a transition and that transition looks
toward the Chinese model. That's why I'm here, that's why the president
sent me here and that's why the president has come so many times."93

Protection refers to the manner by which [[China helps to **"lock in"
authoritarian regimes** that emerge]{.mark} primarily as a result of
endogenous factors.]{.underline} [In these cases, rather than China
propagating authoritarian ideas abroad, a [country]{.mark} has [already
**ventured down the path of democratic backsliding** with little to no
influence from Beijing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet as the country's
leadership increasingly faces mounting domestic and international
pressure (from human rights bodies, restricted channels of global
commerce, sanctions regimes, etc.), it often turns to China as a
powerful extra-hemispheric patron to help navigate the pitfalls of
running a dictatorship. One particularly salient example is that of
Nicaragua, which until 2021 maintained no official relations with the
PRC on account of its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. Thus, the brutal
crackdown in 2018 when the Ortega-Murillo regime murdered hundreds of
protesters, and subsequent waves of political repression, cannot be
directly attributed to PRC propagation.94 The regime's decision to drop
its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and negotiate a free trade
agreement with China in record time has been viewed by most analysts as
a calculated step to insulate the regime from economic pressure by
trading an ally with robust liberal democratic institutions for an
authoritarian state.95 Even though China evinces no preference when it
comes to regime type, authoritarian-minded leaders throughout LAC have
come to bet on the PRC as their partner of choice.

Protection may also account for another phenomenon: authoritarian
resilience and sharing. Many of these theories look to China itself as
an autocratic regime that has successfully weathered the storms of
economic liberalization, globalization, and more recently a wave of
pandemic-induced social upheaval. This literature also notes that
attention should be paid to "deepening autocratization in already
authoritarian countries."96 Here the role of external allies is
especially important to help empower and extend the lifespan of
autocratic regimes beyond their natural lifecycle. [[China has extended
its patronage to]{.mark} all three of the [Western Hemisphere's]{.mark}
consolidated [dictatorships,]{.mark}]{.underline} in forms ranging from
economic support and assistance with sanctions evasion to technology
transfers, allowing regimes to wield the tools of digital
authoritarianism with greater finesse and at scale. In Cuba, China works
with Havana to block internet access for dissenters, and, according to
recent reports, it offered a multibillion-dollar bailout to help the
Cuban regime recover from its economic woes in exchange for greater
access to military basing infrastructure on the island.97 In Nicaragua,
China's engagement appears in its earlier stages for now, but the PRC
has already donated equipment to the country's police forces.98 In
Venezuela, Chinese arms and vehicles have been used to brutally suppress
protests, while the PRC's assistance in developing the Maduro regime's
Carnet de la Patria ("Homeland Card") ID system stands out as one of the
most sophisticated tools of digital authoritarianism in the
hemisphere.99

[Furthermore, in each of these countries, the [quality of
democracy]{.mark} as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit has
**[declined since their inclusion into China's
BRI]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Cuba from 3.31 to 2.84, Nicaragua from 3.60
to 2.50, and Venezuela from 3.87 to 2.88).100 [These ties also seem to
cut both ways, with the stated objective of one ILD exchange between the
CCP and the Communist Party of Cuba being to "learn from Cuba's
experiences in socialist revolution and construction."]{.underline}101
This is not to suggest that China bears sole responsibility for
authoritarian retrenchment in any of these countries, but rather that
[[growing PRC engagement in]{.mark} already [authoritarian contexts
helps these regimes **continue their hold on power,**]{.mark}
potentially beyond the point at which they would be able to survive
through their own resources alone.]{.underline}

### UQ -- Military Presence

#### Trump using military presence to push China out of the canal

**CE Noticias Financieras 25** ("strategic communications consultant,
"After pressure from Trump, Panama gives in on deal with U.S, April 11
2025, "Content Engine" pg-LEXIS ///)

[[US warships will]{.mark} soon [be able to use
the]{.mark} Panama [Canal]{.mark} for free and with
priority]{.underline}, [following a meeting between the two countries
this week]{.underline}. But the decision raises questions about how much
Panamanian sovereignty is at stake with the concession to US pressure to
undermine Chinese influence in Latin America.\
The announcement came on Wednesday 9[, after a meeting between US
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Panamanian President José Raul
Mulino, in a context of high tension since Donald Trump\'s return to the
White House in January.\
The 82-kilometer waterway is strategic for the US and several other
countries because it allows ships to easily pass between the Pacific and
Atlantic oceans without being unloaded or sailing to South
America.\]{.underline}
The Republican has always labeled the fees for using the canal a
\"bad deal\". According to the canal\'s neutrality treaty, all nations
pay the same amount.\
[[Marking]{.mark} his [opposition to China\'s]{.mark} growing
[influence]{.mark} in the region, [the president]{.mark} has also
repeatedly spoken of \"recovering\" the canal, which the US ceded
to Panama in 1999. He [has not ruled out]{.mark} a [military]{.mark}
invasion to achieve this goal.\]{.underline}
\"Sovereignty\" over a cordless phone\
Mulino had already been working to appease the Trump administration.
After a February visit by US Secretary of State Marco
Rubio, [[Panama confirmed that it would pull out of China\'s
Belt]{.mark} and Road or New Silk Road initiative.]{.underline} [His
government also pressured [Chinese conglomerates]{.mark} that own
Panamanian ports to [leave the country]{.mark}.\
In addition, Panama and the US have agreed that [American troops can be
deployed in]{.mark} areas of access and adjacent to
[the Panama Canal]{.mark},]{.underline} according to an agreement signed
between the two countries and published by the AFP news agency.\
[The Panamanian government rules out military bases, a sensitive issue
in the Central American country. Instead, [the US]{.mark} military [will
be able to use the facilities]{.mark} and authorized areas [for
training]{.mark}]{.underline}, exercises and other activities.\
The pact, which will initially be in force for three years, stipulates
that the facilities will be owned by the Panamanian state and will be
for \"joint use\" by the forces of both countries.\
Panama prohibits the establishment of military bases by law and
disbanded the army after the US invaded in 1989 to capture former
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, accused of drug trafficking.\
But there is still a point of contention. The Spanish version of this
week\'s joint statement, released by Panama, said that \"Hegseth
recognized Panama\'s leadership and inalienable sovereignty over
the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas\". The phrase did not appear in
the English version released by the Pentagon.\
\"I believe it was deliberate not to put this in the English version, to
make Panama feel insecure and that the situation has not been
resolved,\" says Natasha Lindstaed, a political scientist at the
University of Essex in the UK.\
Chinese influence\
[Contrary to what Trump claims, the canal was not gifted to the
Panamanians, nor is it controlled by China.]{.underline}\
The US built the Panama Canal between 1904 and 1914. Negotiations to
return control to the Central American country began under Democrat John
F. Kennedy in the early 1960s and lasted until 1977.\
Panama took control of the canal on New Year\'s Eve 1999, on the
condition that it would be operated neutrally.\
But China has influence over the canal. The country is the second
largest user of the waterway, behind the US, and Chinese companies
operate ports at each end.\
Military intervention on the agenda\
[While [Trump works to undermine China\'s influence]{.mark} around the
world - for example, with his trade war - military intervention would
represent a dramatic turnaround in US foreign policy.]{.underline}

announced via TASS. "We [secured a framework for first of Panama [Canal
passage for US military]{.mark} vessels and auxiliary vessels[, as well
as]{.mark} the additional [presence of US troops stationed]{.mark}
through both sides of the Panama Canal,]{.underline}" he told students
at the US Army War College in Pennsylvania. Hegseth first mentioned
[plans to expand US military presence in Panama on April 9]{.underline}
following a visit to the Central American country. [The minister then
spoke about what he called rotational [joint exercises in
Panama]{.mark}. US President Donald [Trump]{.mark} has repeatedly
[said]{.mark} that [Washington]{.mark} needs to [regain control]{.mark}
of the Panama Canal.]{.underline}

He has criticized the high tariffs charged for passage of the Panama
Canal, saying that the transfer of control over the waterway in 1999 was
a gesture of cooperation and not a concession to other countries. On
January 20, [[in]{.mark} his [inaugural address]{.mark}, he
[declar]{.mark}ed an intention to [take back]{.mark} the [Panama
Canal]{.mark}. The US leader [also said]{.mark}]{.underline}, without

China]{.mark}]{.underline}. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said
[[statements]{.mark} that [China holds]{.mark} full [control]{.mark}
over the canal [are]{.mark} "[absolutely false]{.mark}."]{.underline}
Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said that [[sovereignty
over]{.mark} the [canal]{.mark} and the country's independence are [not
negotiable]{.mark}]{.underline}. During Hegseth's April visit, Panama's
Attorney General's Office said it had opened an investigation against

Canal. The company belongs to the Hong Kong-based investment
conglomerate CK Hutchison.

#### US presence and commitment to Panama key to counterbalancing China

https://newsroompanama.com/2025/04/24/panama-and-the-canal-vs-china-u-s-national-security-or-economic-dominance/

Pete Hegseth, the U.S. defense secretary, boldly said, "[The
[U.S.]{.mark} is [tak]{.mark}ing [back]{.mark} China's [influence
from]{.mark} the vital [canal]{.mark}]{.underline}." Hegseth suggested
the [two [superpowers]{.mark} had already [signed]{.mark} an
[agreement]{.mark} fashioned by Panama officials that would [allow U.S.
warships]{.mark} free [passage]{.mark} into and out [of the
canal]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Hold up on that agreement," said Panamanian
President José Raúl Molino, denying such an agreement. Mulino further
rejected Hegseth's announcement with, "I completely reject that
statement." [[Tempers and tensions]{.mark} continue to [escalate
between]{.mark} the [U.S. and China]{.mark} and, as well as the
Panamanian government. There is [no denying]{.mark} that [China]{.mark}
is [investing]{.mark} huge amounts of money and resources [in]{.mark}
the [canal]{.mark}, jockeying [for]{.mark} a [military and
economic]{.mark} advantage.]{.underline}

[China has an [oversized]{.mark} footprint in [military
capability]{.mark}, as well as [ground research stations]{.mark} that
enhance its space programs.]{.underline} China exploits with impunity
U.S. and global natural resources with "factory fishing fleets" that
steal food from the U.S. and other global reasons for war. Hegseth
issued a [chilling warning about the dust up at the canal.]{.underline}
He added that "[[war with]{.mark} [China]{.mark} is [not
inevitable]{.mark} and the U.S. does not seek war in any form. However,
[we]{.mark} must [prevent war by]{.mark} robustly and vigorously
[deter]{.mark}ring [China]{.mark}'s [threats]{.mark} in this
hemisphere]{.underline}." Panama Canal port operations were previously
controlled by the Hong Kong-based company, CK Hutchison. Hutchison
failed to renew its contract in 2021.

Recent aerial photographs show cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port,
operated by Panama Ports Company, at the Panama Canal, in Panama City,
Panama. Last month a conglomerate of affected countries agreed to a \$19
billion deal to sell a group of 43 ports, including two in Panama, to
U.S.-based BlackRock. Trump hailed the agreement, seen as a solution to
his complaints that [the [canal]{.mark} was [owned by China]{.mark}, but
now that [deal]{.mark} may [fall apart]{.mark}]{.underline}. China has
criticized the deal, opening antitrust probes, and a Panamanian official
has accused [CK Hutchison of failing to properly renew its contract in

#### US counterbalancing Chinese presence in the canal 

**Newsroom Panama 4/24**, 4-24-2025, \"Panama and the Canal vs
China/U.S. -- National Security or Economic Dominance?\",
https://newsroompanama.com/2025/04/24/panama-and-the-canal-vs-china-u-s-national-security-or-economic-dominance/

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Wednesday urged the United
States to stop smearing China by stoking up the Panama Canal-related
issues, saying [[no amount of lies]{.mark} can [cover]{.mark} up the
[U.S. ambition]{.mark} to [control]{.mark} the
[canal]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Spokesperson Guo Jiakun also
[urge]{.mark}d the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to [stop
obstructing]{.mark} normal [exchanges and cooperat]{.mark}ion between
China and Latin American countries, including Panama.]{.underline}

Guo made the remarks at a press briefing in response to Panamanian
media's criticism of [[U.S]{.mark}. interference and [hegemonic]{.mark}
[actions in Central American]{.mark} countries, particularly
[Panama]{.mark}. The Panamanian side [accused]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [of exploiting]{.mark} the fabricated
"[China threat]{.mark}" to [seize]{.mark} the [control of]{.mark} the
Panama [Canal]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} exposed [U.S. plans]{.mark} to
[establish]{.mark} a long-term [military presence in Panama]{.mark},
which could cause risks of new military intervention and economic
exploitation, and further [harm]{.mark} of [Panama's interests]{.mark}.
The incisive [commentaries]{.mark} from Panamanian media have [laid
bare]{.mark} the [true nature of U.S. heg]{.mark}emonic
conduct,]{.underline} Guo said.

By [concocting [lies about Chinese control]{.mark} over the Panama Canal
[and]{.mark} maliciously [attacking China]{.mark}, [Washington]{.mark}
is merely creating excuses to [justify]{.mark} its own [control of the
canal]{.mark}, advance its expansion, and pursue its hegemony of Monroe
Doctrine style,]{.underline} Guo added. "Both the international
community and the Panamanian people see through this clearly," said Guo,
adding that [[Panamanian President]{.mark} Jose Raul Mulino has also
[rejected]{.mark} all [claims]{.mark} [of Chinese interference and
intervention]{.mark}. The United States should focus on taking concrete
actions that genuinely contribute to regional and global development and
prosperity,]{.underline} Guo said.

### UQ -- Economic Leverage

#### **US investments are being leveraged to crowd out China**

**Maurer '25** \[Noel; 1/16/25; PhD in History from Stanford, Former
Associate Professor at Harvard Business School, Associate Professor of
International Affairs and International Business at George Washington
University; The Power and the Money, "Seriously, [[China is failing to
take]{.underline}]{.mark} over the [[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark}
Canal!!"
https://www.noelmaurer.com/p/seriously-china-is-failing-to-take\]

Trump's recent comments on the Panama Canal's transit fees and Chinese
influence have thrust the canal to the forefront of US strategic
discourse. Chinese companies such as [Landbridge
Group](https://www.landbridge.com.hk/about.html) and the Hong
Kong-based [CK Hutchison
Holdings](https://www.ckh.com.hk/en/global/home.php) now [operate
ports](https://www.csis.org/analysis/key-decision-point-coming-panama-canal) at
both ends of the canal. This presence raises concerns about potential
dual-use infrastructure and strategic maneuvering, particularly given
China's [deepening
ties](https://dialogue.earth/en/business/26121-belt-and-road-the-new-face-of-china-in-latin-america/) to
Latin America.

Oh come on! The Landbridge Group's project [fell
apart](https://noelmaurer.substack.com/p/china-is-not-trying-to-control-the).
Yes, their project involved buying Margarita Island and turning it into
a potential naval base, what the strategy types call a "dual-use
facility." But it did not happen.

Then he goes on to say:

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[wields **significant**]{.mark} economic [leverage over Panama.
As]{.mark} the **primary** user]{.underline} of the canal
[and]{.underline} Panama's [[**largest** provider of]{.mark} foreign
direct **[investment]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[\$3.8
billion](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-panama/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20provides%20more%20foreign%20direct%20investment,direct%20investment%20position%20of%20%243.8%20billion%20in%202022.) annually---[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[can **influence** Panamanian decision making]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Conversely, the United States and its partners present few viable
alternatives to Chinese investment in the region.

Except, well, doesn't the second sentence contradict the third sentence?
In point of fact, [[there are **plenty** of American]{.mark} and
European [firms who]{.mark}]{.underline} could
[[build]{.underline}]{.mark} the [few [projects that China]{.mark}
actually got off the ground or [operate]{.mark}]{.underline} the two
Chinese-run ports.

China's economic control on both sides of the canal raises concerns
about the potential for rapid militarization and its ability to control
canal access. Panama's willingness to relinquish critical economic
control of strategically significant areas and infrastructure---a
hallmark of [China's Belt and Road
Initiative](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3264659/china-belt-and-road-initiative-outpaces-us-influence/) strategy---casts
doubt on Panama's resolve and capacity to effectively safeguard the
canal's neutrality as agreed to in the treaty. The costs of a neutrality
breach are significant enough that the United States may be justified in
taking preemptive action.

No! [[China does not have economic control on **any side** of the
Canal]{.underline}]{.mark}! That is not a thing that happened!

It is true that [[Chinese]{.mark}-controlled]{.underline} Hutchison does
run intermodal operations on both sides of the Canal via their Panama
Ports Company
subsidiary.[3](https://www.noelmaurer.com/p/seriously-china-is-failing-to-take#footnote-3-154990971) But
Hutchinson's [two [port]{.mark} operation[s aren't even the
biggest]{.mark}]{.underline} in the country! [[The biggest
is]{.underline}]{.mark} run by
an [**[[American]{.underline}]{.mark}**-Panamanian joint
venture](https://www.ssamarine.com/locations/manzanillo-international-terminal/) (Manzanillo).
[The other two]{.underline}, meanwhile, [are]{.underline} run by
a [**[Taiwanese]{.underline}**
conglomerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Group) (Colón),
and a [Singaporean state-owned
firm](https://wpglobalpsastg.wpengine.com/psa-international/) (PSA).

Singapore and Taiwan are many things, but fronts for the People's
Republic of China they ain't.

And more to the point, [[there are **plenty** of]{.mark} of [companies
from Allied countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (including the United States
itself) [[that]{.mark} could [**easily** take]{.mark} over the [Chinese
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline} should Panama decide to kick
them out.

To be frank, I don't understand the claim that leases on these ports
gives "economic control" of the Canal. The geography doesn't really make
sense. Here's the Atlantic side of the Canal, with the Chinese-run ports
in red (obviously) and the other two in navy blue, with the little ship
icon:

And here is the Pacific side (same scale, same color scheme):

Ships going through the Canal bypass the port
operations.[4](https://www.noelmaurer.com/p/seriously-china-is-failing-to-take#footnote-4-154990971) Short
of firing non-existent missiles at passing vessels, the port operators
cannot stop them from using the passageway. The only thing the Chinese
company "controls" is Pacific-side access to the Panama Railroad. Why
that would be useful in a war is beyond me, especially when the United
States would find it trivial to get forces to Panama whereas China is
very very very far
away.[5](https://www.noelmaurer.com/p/seriously-china-is-failing-to-take#footnote-5-154990971)

Yes, [China]{.mark} would certainly love to take over the Panama Canal.
But [[they're treading **lightly**, because]{.underline}]{.mark} they
know that [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[could toss them out]{.mark} at [any
time]{.mark} and [it's]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[not worth **poking**
the American bear]{.underline}]{.mark}. If that weren't the case, then
they [would have built the Nicaraguan
Canal](https://noelmaurer.typepad.com/aab/2015/02/so-far-there-is-no-evidence-that-the-government-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-intends-to-back-the-nicaragua-canal-proj.html) back
when they had the chance.

#### Investments are used to push China out of the region

Jenny **Duan 4/15**/2025, Research Intern for Technology, Trade and
Geopolitics, "Great-power competition in the Panama Canal",
https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2025/04/great-power-competition-in-the-panama-canal/

[[Panama will continue]{.mark} to approach its main priority -- the
[preservation of its autonomy]{.mark} amid great-power competition in
the region]{.underline} -- with flexibility. [[The]{.mark} proposed
BlackRock [acquisition]{.mark}]{.underline} and Panama's BRI exit
[[suggest]{.mark} [that]{.mark} relying on [the US as an investment
partner to the exclusion of China is acceptable to Panama, at least for
now. At the same time, Panama's role as a neutral trade hub means it
will continue balancing relationships with both Washington and
Beijing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Panama is not alone in navigating China--US
tension]{.underline}]{.mark}, as other countries in Latin America such
as Colombia and Mexico may also come under [[pressure from]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [to reduce]{.mark} economic [ties with
Beijing]{.mark} in [favour]{.mark} of [renewed US engagement]{.mark},
particularly given Trump's early focus on issues in the Western
hemisphere.]{.underline} Notably, however, [[China's value as a trade
partner for South America recently increased]{.underline}]{.mark}. With
the opening in November 2024 of a Chinese-financed mega port in Chancay,
Peru, which offers a Pacific-facing alternative to the Panama Canal,
transit times for trade from Peru to China have been cut by 12 days.

The BlackRock-led acquisition of port licenses still requires approval
from Panama's government, with an original deadline of 2 April.
Beijing's opposition to the deal alongside mounting geopolitical
tensions between China and the US have led to its postponement, perhaps
indefinitely[. [Meanwhile]{.mark}, [US]{.mark} Secretary of Defense Pete
Hegseth's visit to Panama last week [signalled]{.mark} Washington's
[intent]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [deepen]{.mark} [not just economic ties, but
also security cooperation]{.mark}, as Panama agreed to a new deal
allowing US troop deployments.]{.underline}

"[[China is pushing for **state-owned** Cosco to be]{.underline}]{.mark}
an [[**equal** partner]{.underline}]{.mark} and shareholder
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[ports]{.underline}]{.mark} with

according to people familiar with the deal talks," Paris and Pitcher
reported. "BlackRock and MSC in March reached a preliminary agreement to
buy the ports in a deal valued at nearly \$23 billion."

"Now, BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison all are open to Cosco's taking a
stake, the people familiar with the talks said," Paris and Pitcher
reported. "[[Any]{.mark} deal giving a [stake]{.mark} in]{.underline}

canal and has objected to Hutchison's ownership of two ports there. The
White House didn't respond to a request for comment Thursday."

[Reuters reported
that](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-threatens-block-panama-ports-deal-unless-its-shipping-giant-gets-stake-wsj-2025-07-17/) "China
has always been firmly opposed to the 'use of economic coercion,
hegemony, bullying, and infringement of the legitimate rights and
interests of other countries,' its foreign ministry spokesperson Lin
Jian said at a press briefing on Friday, when asked about the report."

Details of the Proposed Ports Deal

"Tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison in March announced it would sell its
80% holding in the ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23
countries," Reuters reported. "The business has an enterprise value of
\$22.8 billion, including debt."

"After much scrutiny and criticism in China, CK Hutchison confirmed in
May that Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run MSC, one of
the world's top container shipping groups, was the main investor in a
group seeking to buy the ports," [Reuters
reported](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-threatens-block-panama-ports-deal-unless-its-shipping-giant-gets-stake-wsj-2025-07-17/).
"...The [proposed **sale**]{.underline} has also [drawn]{.underline} the
[attention of]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [[Trump]{.mark},
who]{.underline} has [repeatedly [expressed]{.mark}]{.underline} his
[[desire to **reduce** Chinese influence]{.mark} around the Panama Canal
[and termed the deal]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[['reclaiming']{.underline}]{.mark}** of [[the
waterway]{.underline}]{.mark} after it was first announced."

While it has been a while since President Trump addressed issues around
the canal, [The Hill's Alex Gangitano reported in
January](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5071620-trump-panama-canal-greenland-canada-mar-a-lago/) that
"President-elect Trump on Tuesday refused to commit to not using the
U.S. military to gain control of the Panama Canal, after vowing last
month to take over operation of the key passageway."

"Trump was questioned during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago about his
recently targeting the canal as well as Greenland for possible American
expansion and if he would say he would not use the military to gain
control of it," Gangitano reported. "'I'm not going to commit to that.
It might be that you have to do something,' Trump said. 'Look,

country]{.mark}, it's being operated by China]{.underline}, China. And
[we gave the]{.underline} Panama [Canal to Panama, we didn't give it to

[[Canal of **Extreme Importance** to]{.mark} U.S. [Ag]{.mark}

[Farm News Media's Dennis Rudat

#### The plan causes China fill in -- they'll expand engagement to offset US markets

JOW

[In 2000, the [Chinese market]{.mark} accounted for less than 2 percent
of Latin America's exports, but China's rapid [growth]{.mark} and
resulting demand [drove]{.mark} the region's subsequent [commodities
boom]{.mark}. Over the next eight years, [trade grew]{.mark} at an
annual rate of [31 percent]{.mark}]{.underline} \[PDF\]. By 2021, trade
exceeded \$450 billion---a [figure which grew to a record \$518 billion
in 2024]{.underline}, according to Chinese state media---and some
[[economists predict]{.mark} that it could [exceed \$700 billion]{.mark}
by 2035. [China]{.mark} currently [ranks]{.mark} as South America's [top
trading partner]{.mark} and the [second largest for Latin
America]{.mark} as a whole,]{.underline} after the United States.

Latin America's primary exports to China include soybeans and other
vegetables, animal products, copper, petroleum, oil, and other raw
materials that the country needs to drive its industrial development. In
return, the region mostly imports higher-value-added manufactured
products, a trade some experts say has undercut local industries with
cheaper Chinese goods. [As of 2024, [Beijing]{.mark} has [signed free
trade agreements]{.mark} with Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and
Peru]{.underline}. Trade talks with Uruguay have fallen through due to
opposition from the Mercosur trade bloc, but [[more]{.mark} than [twenty
countries]{.mark} in Latin America and the Caribbean have [signed
on]{.mark} to [China's Belt and Road Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}
(BRI), the most recent being Colombia.

[[Chinese]{.mark} outward foreign direct
[investment]{.mark}]{.underline} (OFDI) [and loans also [play]{.mark} a
major [role in strengthening ties]{.mark} with the region]{.underline}.
In 2024, China's OFDI in Latin America and the Caribbean amounted to
roughly \$8.5 billion, or approximately 6 percent of China's total OFDI.
Meanwhile, [the state-owned [China]{.mark} Development [Bank]{.mark} and
the Export-Import Bank of China [are]{.mark} among the region's [leading
lenders]{.mark}]{.underline}; since 2005, they have loaned more than
\$120 billion to Latin American and Caribbean countries and state-owned
enterprises, often in exchange for oil and used to fund energy and
infrastructure projects. Venezuela is by far the biggest borrower; it
has received nearly \$60 billion worth of Chinese state loans, mostly
relating to energy and infrastructure. That is nearly double the amount
for the second-largest borrower, Brazil. Additionally, China is a
nonborrowing, voting member of the Inter-American Development Bank and
the Caribbean Development Bank.

At a May 2025 ministerial meeting of the China-Community of Latin
American and Caribbean States (CELAC) forum in Beijing, [[China]{.mark}
pledged to [ramp up]{.mark} its [engagement]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. President Xi announced a more than \$9 billion
yuan-dominated credit line to CELAC members for cooperation programs
focused on topics including development and peace and security, as well
as visa-free travel for five unspecified countries. Experts say the
[investment underscores [Beijing]{.mark}'s push to [position]{.mark}
itself as a critical partner [to fill]{.mark} the regional [void left
by]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} under
President Trump.

If given a pair of darts and a map, you would be hard-pressed to hit
[two spots more visibly different than Panama and the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}. These two places, disparate though they may be, are
being [[brought]{.mark} [together by]{.mark} the global threat of
[climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The disappearance of the]{.mark}
Arctic [Ocean's]{.mark} summer [ice]{.mark} over the course of the next
century [could]{.mark} also [herald the disappearance of
Panama's]{.mark} greatest [economic]{.mark} [engine]{.mark} -- [the
Panama Canal]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[as shipping is]{.mark} instead
[redirected]{.mark} [through]{.mark} shorter [Arctic]{.mark}
[routes]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scale of this threat prompts three
questions: what advantages does Arctic shipping provide over the Panama
Canal, how is Panama confronting the issue, and how realistic is the
prospect of greater volumes of Arctic shipping? To answer these
questions, this article will first contrast the merits and importance of
both Arctic and Panama Canal shipping, followed by an examination of
Panamanian news articles and government statements, and then conclude
with a feasibility analysis and future projections. The picture which
emerges is a mixed one: Panama's media tends to focus on more immediate
threats than melting Arctic ice, and while the expansion of Arctic
shipping itself seems inevitable, it remains to be seen how quickly and
how practically it could overshadow the Canal.

[[generated]{.underline}]{.mark} [[significant]{.mark}

[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[leverage]{.underline}]{.mark} in what has so far been a one-sided

Why is Trump focused on these issues now? The incoming

[represent]{.underline} a

[[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} [[about]{.underline}]{.mark} growing
[[Chine]{.mark}se]{.underline} influence over the canal demand
Washington's attention and warrant a measured, diplomatic approach.

Intervention to sovereignty

The Panama [[Canal's]{.underline}]{.mark} [[origins]{.underline}]{.mark}
and US intervention are inextricably [[intertwined]{.underline}]{.mark}.
After failed negotiations with Colombia, the
[[U]{.mark}nited]{.underline} [[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}
[[pivoted]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[support]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Panamanian]{.underline} [[independence]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1903,
with President Theodore Roosevelt employing "gun boat diplomacy" to
deter Colombian resistance to the movement. The [reward]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} military [support]{.underline} [and]{.underline} US
[recognition]{.underline} of the Republic of [Panama]{.underline} was
the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which [granted]{.underline} the
[[U]{.mark}nited]{.underline} [[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} perpetual
[[control]{.underline}]{.mark} [[over]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
[ten]{.underline}-[mile]{.underline}-[wide]{.underline}]{.mark} canal
[[zone]{.underline}]{.mark} [for]{.underline} [ten]{.underline}
[million]{.underline} [dollars]{.underline} down and \$250,000 a year.
After considerable investment of US blood and treasure, the US-built
canal remains a remarkable engineering achievement and a critical artery
of global trade. However, the 1903 political arrangement sowed
deep-seated resentment over perceived infringements on Panamanian
sovereignty.

In 1977, President Jimmy [[Carter]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[championed]{.underline}]{.mark} the Torrijos-Carter
[[Treaties]{.underline}]{.mark}, [aiming]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[[foster]{.underline}]{.mark} [[goodwill]{.underline}]{.mark} and
strengthen US-Panama relations. To secure Senate ratification, two
treaties were negotiated: one for transfer of the canal by the turn of
the millennium and the other to ensure permanent neutrality. The Senate
ratified the treaties by the slimmest of margins. [On]{.underline}

[[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} [about]{.underline} potential
dual-[use]{.underline} [infrastructure]{.underline} and strategic
maneuvering, particularly given China's deepening ties to Latin America.

[[wields]{.underline}]{.mark} significant economic
[[leverage]{.underline}]{.mark} [[over]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the primary user of the canal and
Panama's largest provider of foreign direct investment---\$3.8

[[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} can [[influence]{.underline}]{.mark}
Panamanian [[decision]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[making]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conversely, the United States and its
partners present few viable alternatives to Chinese investment in the
region, a reality unlikely to change in the short term. [Will]{.mark}
[[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark} prioritize alignment with US interests to
safeguard this support, or will it [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark} [[repercussions]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [leveraging]{.underline}
its [control]{.underline} [over]{.underline} [this]{.underline} vital
trade [route]{.underline}? Alternatively, could US economic retaliation,
Panama's reaction, and Chinese competition escalate tensions to the
point that interventions are warranted under the treaty?

Transit fees, which are calculated using a universally applicable
formula, have surged in recent years. In part, these fee increases are a
response to droughts in 2023 and early 2024, which restricted the number
of ships that could transit the canal. Authorities raised fees to
counteract revenue loss from the transit restrictions. Nonetheless, if
costs continue to rise, and if China continues to expand its presence
around the canal, then there may be louder calls to resurrect the
Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. This corollary asserts the
United States' right to intervene in the region to ensure stability and
prevent foreign interference. The legal framework Trump's claim that the
Panama Canal Treaties were a "bad part" of the Carter legacy is a
simplification of the nuanced legal and geopolitical complexities
surrounding the Panama Canal. The Permanent Neutrality Treaty imposed
obligations on both parties. An argument can certainly be made that
Panama has, or is close to, breaching some of its treaty obligations:
Transit fees: Panama committed to ensuring that tolls and related
charges for transit would remain "just, reasonable, equitable, and
consistent with international law." US Senate consent to the treaty was
predicated on an understanding that fee-setting would consider US
interests, including factors such as the feasibility of alternative
transportation modes and the goal of maximizing US international
commerce. While the shipping fees may be flag-agnostic, they have a
disproportionate impact on US shipping. Interpretations of
reasonableness may vary but it is clear that Trump views current fees
paid by US companies as "exorbitant."

Neutrality: Both parties agreed to maintain the canal's permanent
neutrality with particular emphasis on ensuring access for military
vessels. [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
[[control]{.underline}]{.mark} [on]{.underline} [both]{.underline}
[sides]{.underline} of the canal [raises]{.mark}
[[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} [[about]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[potential]{.underline}]{.mark} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} rapid
[[militarization]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[ability]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[control]{.underline}]{.mark} [[canal]{.underline}]{.mark}
[access]{.underline}. Panama's willingness to relinquish critical
economic control of strategically significant areas and
infrastructure---a hallmark of China's Belt and Road
Initiative strategy---casts doubt on Panama's resolve and capacity to
effectively safeguard the canal's neutrality as agreed to in the treaty.
The costs of a neutrality breach are significant enough that the United
States may be justified in taking preemptive action.

The rhetoric, while appealing to nationalist sentiments, risks
undermining decades of diplomacy, established international law, and
US-Panama relations. However, [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[cannot]{.underline}]{.mark} [afford]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[[overlook]{.underline}]{.mark} [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}
[growing]{.underline} [[influence]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[particularly]{.underline}]{.mark} [[given]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[canal's]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic
[[importance]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} US-China
[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}---China ranks as
its second-largest customer. Trump's statements likely aim to pressure
Panama on transit tariffs, caution Panama on increased reliance and
cooperation with China, and project US resolve. To protect its interests
without destabilizing the region, the United States must approach this
situation with strategic foresight and diplomatic precision.

#### The NWP AND NEP pose threats to the Panama and Suez canal's dominance

**Piecyk 21** (Adrian Piecyk, Field Team Captain at Etobicoke Centre,

Oceans: The Arctic Challenges To Panama Shipping Canal",

// AS)

[[The Panama Canal's success depends on]{.mark} its
[convenience]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[shorter distances equal
lower]{.mark} shipping [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Canal
revolutionized international trade upon its opening, as it allowed
vessels to sail directly between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. [What
happens, then, when an even more convenient route opens, and seemingly
with no upfront cost?]{.underline} Just as the Panama Canal earns record
revenues year-after-year, [so too is [the Arctic Ocean seeing record
rates of melting ice]{.mark}]{.underline}. As of August 2020, the Arctic
Ocean maintains approximately 5.08 million km2 of thinner, late summer
ice coverage, but it has lost 3.15 million km2 of late summer ice since
1979, at a rate of close to 76,800km2 per year.6) [[The Northwest
Passage]{.mark}, a sea route which winds its way along Canada's Arctic
coast and [provides the shortest route to the east coast of]{.mark}
North [America]{.mark} from East Asia, could be ice-free and navigable
in summer within a matter of decades. Its sister, [the Northeast
Passage]{.mark}, chiefly follows the northern Russian coast, and so
[provides an alternative to]{.mark} shipping through [the
Suez]{.mark}]{.underline}. Between these two lies the more difficult but
direct Transpolar Route, which could circumvent many of the Northwest
Passage's navigational, depth, and territorial issues were its summer
ice to disappear, as could happen by 2050, according to scientific
predictions.7) The extent of thick, multi-year ice is down 60 percent
from 1980, and its replacement by thinner, seasonal ice could preclude
the need for ice breakers for Arctic shipping.8) A shorter, toll-free
transit route through the Arctic means not only less cost for freight,
but also reduced carbon emissions, and these factors could seriously
affect the decision-making of Panama's key transit partners. Arctic
Voyages -- Fluke or Trend? Over the past decade, [[several]{.mark}
high-profile [transits]{.mark} through the Northwest Passage
specifically [have]{.mark} [highlighted the danger of this]{.mark}
alternate [route to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [Panama]{.mark}
[Canal's]{.mark} [dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Travelling from
Vancouver to Finland in 2013, [[the]{.mark} carrier [Nordic Orion saved
\$200,000]{.mark} and four days of sailing by taking the Northwest
Passage instead of the Panama Canal.]{.underline}9) More recently,
[[the]{.mark} Finnish [icebreaker]{.mark} [Nordica set a record]{.mark}
in 2017 [by travelling 10,000 km in]{.mark} a mere [24 days]{.mark} by a
similar route.]{.underline}10) Though these transits by individual ships
have a limited impact on a broader scale, [[they]{.mark} nevertheless
set a precedent which could [herald]{.mark} [far greater volumes of
traffic]{.mark} through the Arctic [in the]{.mark} near
[future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### That offers 50% savings through quicker deliveries

The [[NSR]{.mark} represents a [**shortcut** for]{.mark} the [transfer
of goods]{.mark} between Europe and Asia [and]{.mark} thus
[offers]{.mark} **[significant cost savings]{.mark}** for shipping
companies]{.underline}. In theory[, [distance
savings]{.underline}]{.mark} [along the NSR can be as **[high as
50%]{.mark}** [compared]{.mark} to the currently used shipping lanes
[via **Suez or Panama**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas a [[voyage]{.mark}
from Japan to Europe [take]{.mark}s roughly **[29 days]{.mark}** via the
Cape of Good Hope]{.underline} and 22 days via the Suez Canal[, it
**[takes just 10 days]{.mark}** [via]{.mark} **the [Arctic
Ocean]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2) The actual sailing distance between
Yokohama in Japan to Rotterdam in the Netherlands is roughly 20,000
kilometers passing through the Suez Canal, but less than 9,000
kilometers via the NSR.

#### 39% of profits shift

Two Oceans: The Arctic Challenge to Panama Canal Shipping", 2021,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/bridge-across-two-oceans-arctic-challenge-panama-canal-shipping/

Considering that [[the **N**]{.mark}**orth[w]{.mark}est
[P]{.mark}assage** [would]{.mark} best **[facilitate]{.mark}
[shipping]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} the US [East Coast and
Asia]{.mark},]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} [picture]{.mark}
[becomes]{.mark} even **[grimmer for Panama]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As
of 2019, [official stats record that a **staggering [39 percent]{.mark}
of total** tonnage [pass]{.mark}ing **[through]{.mark}** the
**[Panama]{.mark}** Canal travels along the East Coast-Asia
route]{.underline}, translating to 180,564,000 PC/UMS net tons out of
468,779,000 total.^11)^ [The next largest route by cargo throughput,
between the US East Coast and the west coast of South
America]{.underline}, comes out to 38,640,000 PC/UMS, or a mere 8
percent of total tonnage. The United States alone accounts for no less
than 66.4 percent of Canal traffic by origin and destination, followed
perhaps unsurprisingly by China at 13.6 percent.^12)^ [On a global
scale, [the Panama Canal]{.mark} [facilitates]{.mark} approximately [**5
percent of** total **oceanic shipping**]{.mark}, an impressive figure,
but one which is overwhelmingly dependent on the flow of trade between
the US and China.]{.underline}

Given the inexorable march of climate change and unprecedented ice melt
in the North, the question facing the Panama Canal in terms of future
traffic loss is less "if" and more "how much." [[The E]{.mark}ast [Coast
-- Asia route is]{.mark} indisputably [the cornerstone of Panama Canal
traffic]{.mark}, and [if the US ]{.mark}]{.underline}and China
[leap]{.mark} at the opportunity [[for]{.mark} up to 30 percent [shorter
journeys]{.mark} compared to taking the Canal,^13[)]{.mark}^[ the
**losses in revenue**]{.mark} for Panama [could be
**staggering**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Using the 2019 figures as a
baseline, a conservative loss of 25 percent along the East Coast -- Asia
route alone would see PC/UMS tonnage drop by 45,141,000, or more than
7,000,000 PC/UMS than the next leading route has total. A far worse
scenario with 75 percent losses would see a staggering drop of
135,423,000 PC/UMS, a whopping 29 percent of total tonnage.

The [number of vessels navigating these waters \[Northwestern Passage\]
is lower]{.underline} compared to the NSR. This is [due to]{.underline}
various reasons, including [complex geography]{.underline} (there are
many narrow and shallow corridors along this specific passage), as well
as ocean currents, [along with **drifting ice packs** that **block**
many of the entrance and exit site]{.underline}s. Also, there is a
different view between Canada and the U.S. regarding the legal regime of
the passage (Canada maintains the position that these waters are
"internal" therefore fall under its jurisdiction, but the U.S. maintains
the high seas status respectively) \[25,26\]. Hinterland connection is
another setback; venturing transport through the northern territories of
Canada and Alaska has been characterized as the logistical equivalent of
a lunar landing \[27\]. [[The NWP is mainly regarded as an
**alternative** to the Panama Canal]{.underline}]{.mark}, though the
investments on the latter to increase its size and crossing speed will
help maintain its competitiveness in the near future. [Additionally,
[**icebreaker services** in this area are extremely low]{.mark} both in
**quantity** and **quality** compared to those **offered by Russia** for
the **NSR**.]{.underline}

[In addition to navigation challenges and lack of infrastructure and
response capabilities, coupled with the potential of unforeseen maritime
accidents and environmental disasters]{.underline}, there are
[looming]{.underline} energy, infrastructure, and [geopolitical
ambitions amongst many countries]{.underline} with a vested interest in
the region (Figure 2). For many countries, [[the Arctic presents an
**investment opportunity** to elevate their strategic and **economic
significance** as well as boost their international
status]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark,
and Norway have all been trying to assert jurisdiction over part of the
Arctic. In fact, Denmark, Canada, Norway, and Russia have already made
submissions in relation to the Arctic seabed to the United Nations
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), which was
established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
\[28\]. Recently, in August of 2015, Russia resubmitted a bid to the
CLCS claiming vast territories in the Arctic, specifically laying claim
to 1.2 million square kilometers (km) of sea shelf extending more than
350 nautical miles from the shore \[29\].

Furthermore, [for these countries claiming a presence in Arctic
developments, it is **imperative** that a **prominent maritime
presence** is clearly established.]{.underline} It is important to fully
understand that [major technological advances]{.underline} in overall
safety systems onboard ships to [include design and
[construction]{.mark} standards]{.underline} and navigational aids and
equipment have **[[renewed]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[interest
of]{.mark} both [Canada and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
regarding the]{.underline} benefits associated with the
[NWP]{.underline} \[30\]. [[Canada maintains the]{.underline}]{.mark}
position that the [[NWP]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially those areas in
the Arctic Archipelago, [[are **internal**]{.mark} waters to Canada [and
should be provided with]{.mark} the [right to **prohibit**
transit]{.mark}]{.underline} \[23\]. [[This]{.mark} interpretation [is
**not held** by]{.mark} most [maritime nations]{.mark}]{.underline},
including the United States and a certain number of European Union's
member-states that consider the [[NWP as]{.mark} an
[international]{.mark} strait]{.underline} according to the description
outlined in the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention \[28\].
This distinction is incredibly important because applying the UNCLOS
provisions limits Canada's rights to enact fishing and environmental
regulations, fiscal and smuggling laws, shipping safety laws, but
[[leaves the passage]{.mark} as an **international** strait [open to
**all nations**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[31\].

#### Ice breakers are key to opening trade routes.

Robert **Hammitt 17**, Fellow at Polar Research and Policy Initiative,
researcher at Carleton University with a focus in Europe and Eurasian
studies, 1/24/27, "Icebreakers: an overview",
https://polarconnection.org/icebreakers/ //maeve

Whether owned and operated by national governments, state-owned
enterprises, or in private hands, some icebreakers and fleets are
primarily focused on commercial operations. [[Icebreakers have engaged
in many]{.mark} types of [commercial
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark}

[escorting and [supporting cargo vessels engaged in Arctic
shipping]{.mark};]{.underline}

[[protecting oil and gas operations]{.mark} from ice;]{.underline}

[**[keeping ports and their approaches open to allow trade to
flow]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In some sub-arctic waters, such as the Baltic Sea, seasonal
**[[commercial icebreaking is critical to enable trade through the
winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition, the Soviet and Russian
governments have always relied on the Northern Sea Route along Russia's
Arctic coast to bring natural resources out of Siberia and the far north
and to bring goods into those communities.

In more recent years, Russia has focused on expanding the Northern Sea
Route. This expansion is linked to increased mining and energy
extraction, especially on the Yamal Peninsula. Russia has also promoted
the Arctic route as an alternate global shipping route, offering a
considerably shorter voyage between northern Europe and East Asia than
the traditional Suez Canal route. However, to date, the particular
challenges and risks of this route have prevented its rapid growth.

[[Icebreakers are]{.mark} also [used to support]{.mark} oil- and
[natural gas]{.mark}-drilling and [exploration]{.mark}]{.underline}.
During its operations off the North Slope of Alaska, Shell leased the
privately-owned Aiviq and the MSV Fennica owned by Finland's Arctia
Offshore. In addition to protecting the exploration fleet from
unexpected ice conditions, icebreakers are necessary to provide access
to year-round production platforms, such as the Goliat platform and
Prirazlomnaya platform in Norwegian and Russian waters respectively.
Finally, [[icebreakers are an important point of oil-spill
response]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fennica was an important part of Shell's
Alaska operations because it carried a capping stack, necessary to close
a gushing well in the event of a blowout. Because US regulations for
Arctic drilling require that operators have the capacity to deal with a
blowout before the end of the season, a late-season disaster would force
response operations to continue even as winter ice returns.

Similarly, this fall's cruise through North America's Northwest Passage
by the cruise ship Crystal Serenity hired the RRS Ernest
Shackleton, operated by the British Antarctic Society, to escort it
through the Canadian Archipelago (the Shackleton is an ice-strengthened
ship for polar operations, rather than a true icebreaker). As with
Shell's icebreaker fleet, the Shackleton is intended to provide a safety
margin if severe ice conditions develop, rather than because Crystal
Cruises expects to travel through pack ice conditions.

As these examples demonstrate[, [commercial icebreaking operations are
driven by]{.mark} the [economic needs of shipping
companies]{.mark}]{.underline} and other maritime operators. This sets
an upper limit on the necessary upper icebreaking capacity, barring
emergency situations, since commercial operators are only willing to
face a certain degree of risk before their operations become
uneconomical. In addition, the world fleet of ice-strengthened
commercial ships, capable of safely travelling in heavier ice
conditions, is relatively small. Although more Polar-class ships will be
built, many operators, such as Russia's Norilsk Nickel, are looking
toward cargo ships with their own icebreaking capacity, able to operate
separately from an icebreaker-supported convoy. This tendency will not
entirely obviate the need for commercial icebreakers, but is a sign that
[[icebreaker-led convoys shouldn't be taken for granted as the form of
future Arctic shipping]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Arctic sea routes shift Chinese interest---Icebreakers key to navigate the region and prevent illiberal Arctic influence.

journalist for The Arctic Institute, "Geopolitical Implications of New
Arctic Shipping Lanes",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/geopolitical-implications-arctic-shipping-lanes/

[[States]{.mark} have [expressed]{.mark} [interest]{.mark} in using new
shipping lanes [for shorter transit times, strategic resource
extraction, military activity]{.mark} [as well as]{.mark}]{.underline}
regional shipping, fishing and tourism.^2)^ However, with its
unpredictable seas, severe climate conditions, high costs, and lack of
developed infrastructure in the northern territories -- the Arctic has
many obstacles for [[socio-economic]{.mark} and maritime
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}.^3)^

Despite these obstacles, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} [renewed regional
interest [may lead to increased geopolitical
tensions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Increasing traffic brings the possibility
of unknown ships close to many of these country's coasts in a way that
they are not familiar with. [[States]{.mark} then must
[determine]{.mark} [how]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [control]{.mark} their
northern [borders]{.mark} [in harsh climates]{.mark} and territories
[that]{.mark}, until recently, [were]{.mark}
[impassable]{.mark}.]{.underline} Without some kind of vigilance over
their borders, Arctic states may also run the risk of facilitating or
falling victim to increased transnational crime. For example, unknown
ships also bring with them unknown purposes, of which many could be
illegal fishing or even illicit trafficking. [Further, [the development
of the NSR and NWP]{.mark} also [present]{.mark}s possible
[issues]{.mark}. [Unresolved]{.mark} [disputes]{.mark} [about]{.mark}
the [sovereignty]{.mark} [of]{.mark} these new [sea]{.mark}
[routes]{.mark} may be [problematic]{.mark} when shipping does
eventually become an option]{.underline}. [[China and Russia's
cooperation]{.mark} on the [development of the NSR]{.mark} also
[brings]{.mark} with it [concerns about Chinese influence in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as [American
hand-wringing]{.underline} about a closer relationship between Russia
and China.

**The Northern Sea Route**

Although the Northern Sea Route (NSR) was first opened by the Soviet
Union in the 1930s, it has not been a reliable transit route for many
decades due to ice coverage.^4)^ However, with the increasing melting of
the polar ice caps, the NSR is looking more and more like a potential
transit route. However, there are geopolitical implications concerning
the NSR that raise interesting questions. Perhaps the most basic
geopolitical consideration is who has power over the NSR. Russia has
claimed that the NSR lies within its territorial waters, giving it
exclusive rights to develop the area and to patrol ships.^5)^ The United
States and other powers have disputed this claim, which has led to an
interesting paradox where neither side recognizes the veracity of who
can control this passageway. Interestingly, Canada does recognize
Russia's claim over the NSR as Russia recognizes Canada's claim over the
NWP (*See below*).

Another geopolitical concern is the development of the NSR. While the
United States has failed for many years to express interest, not all
states have taken such an approach. [China, for example, is working with
Russia to develop the NSR as [China sees the route as]{.mark} [important
for its national economic interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the
investment is hugely expensive and time consuming[, [China]{.mark}
clearly sees the [development]{.mark} of the NSR as [playing the long
game]{.mark}.]{.underline}^6)^ While the route may not be usable now, in
a few decades, that could easily change. [[Geopolitically]{.mark},
[this]{.mark} has huge implications as it [brings China and
Russia]{.mark} closer together [as allies and encourages both states to
develop more icebreakers]{.mark} -- a [necessary]{.mark} tool [to
navigate the region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### L\-\--Greenland

#### Cooperation with Greenland is key to access shipping routes.

United States officials have for more than a century viewed Greenland's
vast deposits of oil, gas and critical minerals as a treasure chest
that's waiting to be opened, government documents show.

But the challenge of unlocking those riches from the rugged, ice-covered
island consistently has stymied the development efforts of ambitious
mining firms and some of the world's largest oil companies.

[Now, President Donald [Trump]{.mark} is reviving an old idea with a new
geopolitical twist: To [prevent greater Chinese control of the
Arctic]{.mark} and rare earth minerals market, the U.S. would take over
the Danish territory --- by buying or seizing it.]{.underline} Trump's
strong-arm tactics toward Denmark have sent shock waves through Europe
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense alliance, while
industry analysts have been left scratching their heads.

[[If Trump intends to secure U.S. **access** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
those resources and to [[**newly navigable Arctic shipping routes**,
analysts argued, it likely would be easier to accomplish those goals by
**working with leaders in** ]{.mark}**Nuuk,** the capital of

#### Infrastructure key to displacing Panama's dominance in the shipping industry

// AS)

[Finally, [the]{.mark} last and seemingly greatest [obstacle to
an]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} [overthrow of the]{.mark} Panama
[Canal's]{.mark} [dominance is its]{.mark} remoteness and the
[difficulty]{.mark} inherent [in developing]{.mark} the
region.]{.underline} As early as 2005, [the US Arctic Research
Commission noted that even with melting ice, [a lack of natural
harbours, transport or commercial infrastructure,]{.mark} and especially
bathymetric and topographic data of possible routes would seriously
[hamper large-scale trade]{.mark} through the
region.]{.underline}34[) It is easy to say that development in the
Arctic would be unnecessary]{.underline} when the ultimate destination
of goods flowing through the North is Europe or the American East Coast,
but this fails to consider the importance of the "Pendulum Model" of
maritime shipping, where vessels make several stops along their journeys
to pick up and drop off cargo.35) This model requires not only
significant port infrastructure, but also large enough markets to make
such deliveries profitable [-- [two things]{.mark} [the Arctic]{.mark}
notably [lacks]{.mark}, and [which the ACP recognizes as a]{.mark}

The [number of vessels navigating these waters \[Northwestern Passage\]
is lower]{.underline} compared to the NSR. This is [due to]{.underline}
various reasons, including [complex geography]{.underline} (there are
many narrow and shallow corridors along this specific passage), as well
as ocean currents, [along with **drifting ice packs** that **block**
many of the entrance and exit site]{.underline}s. Also, there is a
different view between Canada and the U.S. regarding the legal regime of
the passage (Canada maintains the position that these waters are
"internal" therefore fall under its jurisdiction, but the U.S. maintains
the high seas status respectively) \[25,26\]. Hinterland connection is
another setback; venturing transport through the northern territories of
Canada and Alaska has been characterized as the logistical equivalent of
a lunar landing \[27\]. [[The NWP is mainly regarded as an
**alternative** to the Panama Canal]{.underline}]{.mark}, though the
investments on the latter to increase its size and crossing speed will
help maintain its competitiveness in the near future. [Additionally,
[**icebreaker services** in this area are extremely low]{.mark} both in
**quantity** and **quality** compared to those **offered by Russia** for
the **NSR**.]{.underline}

[[In addition to navigation challenges and lack of infrastructure
and]{.mark} response capabilities, coupled with the potential of
unforeseen maritime accidents and environmental disasters]{.underline},
[[there are looming energy, infrastructure, and geopolitical ambitions
amongst many countries]{.underline}]{.mark} with a vested interest in
the region (Figure 2). For many countries, [[the Arctic presents an
**investment opportunity** to elevate their strategic and **economic
significance** as well as boost their international
status]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark,
and Norway have all been trying to assert jurisdiction over part of the
Arctic. In fact, Denmark, Canada, Norway, and Russia have already made
submissions in relation to the Arctic seabed to the United Nations
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), which was
established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
\[28\]. Recently, in August of 2015, Russia resubmitted a bid to the
CLCS claiming vast territories in the Arctic, specifically laying claim
to 1.2 million square kilometers (km) of sea shelf extending more than
350 nautical miles from the shore \[29\].

Furthermore, [for these countries claiming a presence in Arctic
developments, it is **imperative** that a **prominent maritime
presence** is clearly established.]{.underline} It is important to fully
understand that [major technological advances]{.underline} in overall
safety systems onboard ships to [include design and
[construction]{.mark} standards]{.underline} and navigational aids and
equipment have **[[renewed]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[interest
of]{.mark} both [Canada and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
regarding the]{.underline} benefits associated with the
[NWP]{.underline} \[30\]. [[Canada maintains the]{.underline}]{.mark}
position that the [[NWP]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially those areas in
the Arctic Archipelago, [[are **internal**]{.mark} waters to Canada [and
should be provided with]{.mark} the [right to **prohibit**
transit]{.mark}]{.underline} \[23\]. [[This]{.mark} interpretation [is
**not held** by]{.mark} most [maritime nations]{.mark}]{.underline},
including the United States and a certain number of European Union's
member-states that consider the [[NWP as]{.mark} an
[international]{.mark} strait]{.underline} according to the description
outlined in the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention \[28\].
This distinction is incredibly important because applying the UNCLOS
provisions limits Canada's rights to enact fishing and environmental
regulations, fiscal and smuggling laws, shipping safety laws, but
[[leaves the passage]{.mark} as an **international** strait [open to
**all nations**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[31\].

The Threat Landscape

While the TSR may not fully open for another 20 years, [[Russia has
already taken steps to **cement its influence in the
region.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [In July 2022, Russian President Vladimir
Putin declared the Russian military will defend its claims to the Arctic
"by all means" necessary.]{.underline} Putin has backed his rhetoric
with substantive commitment to the area: [Russia has about 33% more
military bases in the Arctic Circle than NATO does.]{.underline} While
this may be unsurprising because 53% of the Arctic coastline is under
Russian control, that does not mean that the United States and NATO
partners should accept a position of regional inferiority.

Russia has more icebreakers -- valuable military assets that help clear
icy paths for commercial and military ships -- than NATO. The U.S. only
accounts for two icebreakers in NATO's undersized fleet, lagging far
behind its adversary. Icebreakers will be essential in making use of the
TSR as early as the 2030s. This may seem relatively far away. But the
race begins now. Icebreakers need to be constructed. Military bases need
to be built. Transit infrastructure needs to be set up. All of this
takes time, [and for the U.S. to be ready when the Arctic becomes
accessible, **it must lay the groundwork now.**]{.underline}

[Given Russia's military bases and icebreakers, scholars believe that
the West trails 10 years behind Russia militarily in the region. [Russia
has established a foothold near the CAO that will give it
oversight,]{.mark} control and area-denial capabilities [over the
TSR]{.mark}. The U.S. must contest the aspiring Russian hegemony in
order to better position the United States toward active use of the
TSR.]{.underline}

The potential for Sino-Russian collaboration in the region is
concerning. In 2018, China claimed to be a "near-Arctic state,"
signaling that it seeks to shape the political and economic future of
the region. Beijing's goal for a Polar Silk Road that connects Russia to
the Belt and Road trade initiative has led to billions of dollars in
foreign direct investment. Even more concerning is the aggressive
rhetoric with which the Chinese military frames its regional
aspirations. Beijing emphasizes that the Arctic represents a "scramble
for new strategic spaces," and thus, China "cannot rule out the
possibility of using force." This is particularly relevant to the TSR:
in the summer of 2020, the Chinese icebreaker MV Xue Long 2 voyaged the
TSR for the first time. It would be a mistake to think that Russia is
the only adversary to U.S. economic interests in the TSR.

The Arctic Trilemma: The United States' Way Forward

Given the regional and strategic complexities outlined above, what
should the U.S. policy be, and why? To recall, the Arctic trilemma has
three legs: [access to the TSR, a greater U.S. military presence in the
region, and stability and cooperation vis-a-vis Russia.]{.underline} One
may consider each side of the trilemma. [First, [if the U.S. wants free
economic access]{.mark} to the TSR but wants to avoid a hostile economic
environment by cooperating with Russian interests , [it must sacrifice
**establishing a greater military presence in the region.**]{.mark}
Russia will not unconditionally cooperate and promote an uncontested
peace if the U.S. military challenges their positions in the
region.]{.underline} Putin's invasion of Ukraine provides telling
evidence: the authoritarian has asserted that he can and will respond
forcefully to perceived U.S.and NATO threats to Russian sovereignty. As
a result, the U.S. would have to concede to Russian oversight to ensure
cooperation and economic access, a position which Washington should --
and would -- never accept.

Figure 2: The Arctic Trilemma for the United States

[Alternatively, [the U.S. **can have primary access**]{.mark} **to the
TSR [and advance military objectives in the region]{.mark}** [,]{.mark}
but sacrifice cooperation with Russia and prompt Great Power Competition
in the Arctic. The [Russia]{.mark}ns already [have an entrenched
military presence in the Arctic and can leverage its assets to
dominate]{.mark} the TSR if they are uncontested.]{.underline} [Thus,
[the United States]{.mark} must [**cultivate a formidable military force
in the region** to ensure that U.S.companies can utilize the TSR to
their maximum economic advantage. Open sea lanes would have to be
secured through U.S. and Allied sea control.]{.mark} The competition to
be the economic hegemon of the TSR makes any opportunity for joint
efforts toward mutual prosperity unlikely and military steadfastness a
necessity.]{.underline}

Lastly, the U.S. can maintain peace and project a strong military
footprint but suffer from suboptimal access to the TSR. The political
climate of the Arctic would resemble a Cold War-esque gridlock due to
military build-up by both nations and potentially others who wish to
enter the mix. The militarization of the Arctic would sacrifice the
greater economic gains both sides could have achieved through a
demilitarized strait..

Within this trilemma, the U.S. must secure access to the TSR and
establish a strong military presence in the Arctic, embracing great
power competition. Given Putin's militarism and completely shattered
relations with the West post-February 2022, Washington should not pursue
cooperation. To secure U.S.economic interests in the TSR in the 2040s is
to ensure no adversary will threaten U.S. ships. Naval theorist Alfred
Thayer Mahan argued that securing access to the high seas for trade and
commerce is crucial for a nation. Sea lines like the TSR are the
economic arteries of Great Powers. They sustain economic life. And they
are too important to be left under adversarial control. The U.S. must
command the Arctic sea, like it has commanded the Pacific and other
oceans for the better part of half a century

Conclusions

[[U.S. dominance of the TSR]{.mark} is **valuable for economic reasons
because it reduces [trade time and cost.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Yet, in
a Mahanian fashion, [TSR [economic gains are contingent on]{.mark}
United States and Russian [military competition in the Arctic]{.mark}
Circle.]{.underline} Confronted with a trilemma, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [must pursue]{.mark} two of three policy goals:
[economic access]{.mark} to the TSR [and greater military
presence]{.mark} around the route.]{.underline} Cooperation with Russia
will only lead to feeble U.S. economic and defense posture in the
region. [Russia has a clear economic interest in accessing a faster
trade route in the TSR and its clear military buildup of the Arctic has
forced the U.S. hand to match it with its own military
might.]{.underline} The U.S. military can do this by making changes on
the strategic, operational, and tactical levels by expanding its number
of Arctic bases, shifting jurisdiction of the Arctic to USEUCOM, and
placing ESBs in the GSN Gap. The United States. must establish itself as
a regional power in the Arctic to realize TSR's economic potential
before it opens in the 2040s.

Climate change alters [**ship's** itineraries]{.underline} in the
**[North]{.underline}**

About [**[10]{.mark}** [percent]{.mark}]{.underline} of [Arctic
[waters]{.mark} are [**surveyed** to modern]{.mark}]{.underline} or
adequate **[[standards]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and appropriate
[corrections]{.underline} for charts [must be applied]{.underline}
according to data sources and alterations originating from climate
change processes.13) When it comes to natural factors, such as weather
and climate, the [lack of **technology**]{.underline}, [insufficient
**infrastructure**]{.underline} and equipment, and [human
factors]{.underline} may significantly [[decrease]{.mark} the
[**safety** of **navigation**]{.mark} across the Arctic]{.underline}.14)

The frequency of extreme weather events is growing in the North. These
changes are affecting the Arctic shipping in many ways, including the
increase in risk for navigation. Lower central pressures for the
poleward-shifted storms, which are increasing in number, may result in
increased wind speeds and extreme wave heights in polar regions, with an
associated increase in the sea-spray icing of ships.15) For example,
this was a reason why the fishing vessel Onega capsized in the Barents
Sea in December 2020, after a period of extreme sea-spray icing
conditions.16)

Out-of-date [nautical **[charts]{.mark}** may pose [a **huge
risk**]{.mark} for navigation]{.underline} in shallow waters and fjords
of the Arctic. Concerns should be raised in the maritime [**industry**
over the **quality** of the data]{.underline} upon which the charts are
based, since the age and [accuracy]{.underline} of data on nautical
charts may [significantly vary]{.underline}. One of the reasons for the
inaccuracy of data might be an [environmental **shift** caused by
climate **change**]{.underline}. In fjords with active melting glaciers
-- a meltout sediment from the basal ice [adds **sediment** to the
**flow** and increases the deposition rate]{.underline}, and as a result
the [bottom **topography** changes **significantly** over the
years]{.underline}.17) These factors were likely the case when the
expedition cruise ship The Ocean Explorer got stuck in the mud in a
remote area of Alpefjord, East Greenland, in 2023.18) Numerous examples
show that the harsh environment of polar regions still may pose a
considerable risk to ship navigation.

The Polar Code: Sailing through a plethora of challenges

The Polar Code,the international code of safety for ships operating in
polar waters, is a relatively recent and significant milestone in
international regulation of navigation in polar waters,which covers a
wide range of requirements to ships operating in the frigid waters of
the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas.19) It has been created as a
compulsory framework for safe ship operation and environmental
protection in icy waters. On one hand, the Polar Code's provision gives
a solid universal set of operating standards for various vessels sailing
in the polar areas. On the other hand, experts identify multiple notable
gaps in the documents, especially related to the environmental
protection, pollution, and safety of various types of vessels.20) Among
other obstacles, issues related to climate change are not properly
covered in the Code at all. A broad variety of climate-induced
environmental impacts includes not only temperature and sea-ice
conditions mentioned in the documents but many other parameters such as
fog, sea-spray icing, atmospheric rivers, unusual storms, and more.

The Polar Code has been improving since the time it was adopted by the
International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2014. The most significant
modifications are related to pollution of the Arctic Ocean, such as the
prohibition on the use of heavy fuel,21) and discussions on underwater
noise pollution.22) However, it is [[difficult to find]{.mark} any
**[advice]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the [**prediction** and
**mitigation**]{.mark}]{.underline} of [hazardous weather events caused
by climate change]{.underline} on [ships]{.underline} operating in polar
regions. Icy [waters remain highly **unpredictable** for various types
of **ships**]{.underline}, even the best prepared and equipped, as
recent incidents demonstrate.

As a result, significant [[efforts]{.mark} [should be made to
**research**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[develop]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and [[improve]{.mark} life-saving **equipment**]{.underline} and
[[communication]{.underline}]{.mark} technology aboard the vessels
operating in the polar waters.23) The need for independent maritime
regulatory authorities as well as the development of state transport
policies, and wider [[information-sharing]{.mark} **relating** to the
**analysis** of the impact of climate change]{.underline} should be
[taken into **account**]{.underline}.24)

Conclusion

The polar regions can still be considered among the [most
**challenging** environments to **navigate** by **sea**]{.underline} due
to [risks]{.underline} presented [by unpredictable **weather** and
**climate** factors]{.underline}. The [number of **[ships]{.mark}**
[sailing in Arctic]{.mark} waters]{.underline} is
**[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}** and will [continue to
**[grow]{.mark}** over coming decades]{.underline}, which will
[[produce]{.mark} both **[opportunities]{.mark}** and
**challenges**]{.underline}. The escalating impacts of climate change in
the northern waters have created [ample [**opportunities**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} Arctic **[[shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}**
activities [[related to cargo]{.mark} shipping]{.underline},
[fishing]{.underline}, expedition cruise tourism, [mineral resource
**exploration**]{.underline}, science, and naval activities. Visual
observation using satellite images can help in [selecting
**[safer]{.mark}** [routes]{.mark} to [avoid]{.mark}
**[icebergs]{.mark}**]{.underline} and sea [ice]{.underline}. However,
extreme weather events and the [effects of climate change]{.underline}
such as Arctic [[cyclones]{.underline}]{.mark}, unexpectedly high
[[ocean **waves**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and rapid [sea ice
[drift]{.mark} may increase **uncertainties** in forecasts]{.underline}
and [make **navigation** unsafe]{.underline}. Well-established
[communication]{.underline} and
[information-**[sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[between]{.underline}]{.mark} researchers and [[ship
crews]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[crucial]{.mark} [for]{.mark} all
kinds]{.underline} of **[[vessels]{.underline}]{.mark}** to make
[information **complete**]{.underline}, [precise]{.underline}, and
[available]{.underline}. In addition, [together with international
maritime **laws** and **policies**]{.underline} and the Polar Code, a
development of a shared governance framework to cope with the various
challenges stemming from the climate change impact will be crucial in
the future.

### L ---REM

#### U.S. rare earth mining in Greenland [trades-off]{.underline} with focus on the Panama Canal for [new]{.underline} Arctic shipping routes.

**Milman '25** {Oliver; 1/13/25; Milman is an environmental
correspondent for the Guardian. He wrote the acclaimed The Insect Crisis
in 2022 'It's ironic': how climate crisis is driving Trump push on
Greenland and Panama'
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/13/trump-greenland-panama-canal-climate-crisis?}

Donald Trump's desire to seize control of Greenland and the Panama canal
is being shaped in part by a force that he has sought to deny even
exists -- the climate crisis.

Last week, [Trump ramped up his **demands** that the United States
**annex** both **Greenland** and the Panama canal,]{.underline} refusing
to rule out economic or even military interventions to take them and
threatening "very high" tariffs upon Denmark, of which Greenland is an
autonomous territory, if it opposes him.

["We need them for **economic security**," [Trump said]{.mark}. "The
**Panama Canal** is vital to our country, it's being operated by
**China**. China! We gave the Panama canal to Panama, not China." The US
president-elect added that [**Greenland** was required for "national
**security** purposes" and]{.mark} that [Denmark "should give it
up"]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What do Greenlanders make of Donald Trump's advances for their home?

Trump's rhetoric has been denounced by other world leaders but the
rationale for this expansionism is being influenced, experts say, by
something affecting both Greenland and Panama -- rising global
temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels.

Even though the incoming US president has called climate change a "giant
hoax", his son [[**Donald Jr** acknowledged the value of
**mining**]{.mark} **[r]{.mark}**ar**[e]{.mark}**
**[m]{.mark}**ineral**[s]{.mark}** [in Greenland]{.mark} that are being
uncovered as the ice rapidly retreats from the vast Arctic
island]{.underline}. Greenland's enormous ice sheet is losing an average
of 30m tonnes of ice an hour due to the climate crisis, raising sea
levels and potentially collapsing vital ocean currents.

[Donald Jr said on a trip to the island last week that he wanted to
"make Greenland great again", accusing Denmark of blocking its
self-governing territory from developing "the great **natural
resources** that they have]{.underline}, whether that's coal, whether
that's uranium, whether that's other [rare minerals]{.underline},
whether that's gold or diamonds".

[As sea ice dwindles in the Arctic Ocean, meanwhile, [new **shipping
routes**]{.mark}]{.underline} [through the far northern latitudes are
[becoming more **viable**]{.mark}. Robert **O'Brien**, [Trump's former
national security adviser]{.mark}, [said that Greenland]{.mark}, which
has had a US military base since 1941, is key to counter the threat of
China and Russia but it [is]{.mark} also ["very important to the
Arctic]{.mark}, [which is]{.mark} going to be the critical battleground
of the future because as the climate gets warmer, the **Arctic** is
[going to be a pathway that]{.mark} maybe [**cuts down** on the usage of
the **Panama canal**]{.mark}".]{.underline}

While global heating is causing Greenland to shed its ice, in Panama it
has helped spur a severe drought that has gripped the country since
2023. This drought has caused the human-made Gatún Lake, which supplies
the water for the canal, to plummet by several feet, limiting traffic
through the famed shipping thoroughfare.

Last year, shipping entering the canal slumped by nearly a third due to
these restrictions. The US reasserting dominion over the Panama canal,
which it handed over to Panama via a treaty in 1999, would, like in
Greenland, give it opportunistic control over resources increasingly
strained by the climate crisis.

["**[Greenland]{.mark}** has lost massive amounts of ice, making it more
[attractive for **rare earth mining**]{.mark} and oil drilling, while we
are [already seeing more **traffic** through the Arctic Ocean]{.mark} as
it becomes ice free for longer," said Alice Hill, a former climate
adviser to Barack Obama and now a fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations.]{.underline}

"In Panama, climate change impacts how the canal operates and puts
pressure on the US to find different routes or try to get priority over
China for the canal itself.

"Climate change is altering the fundamental calculus of the strategic
importance of the Arctic as well as the Panama canal," Hill added. "It's
ironic that we are getting a president who famously called climate
change a hoax but is now expressing interest in taking over areas
gaining greater importance because of climate change."

The impacts of a superheated planet are helping refashion geopolitics in
a variety of ways, as droughts and storms cause people to migrate,
conflicts erupt over resources such as water and borders are even
redrawn between some countries as snow and ice dwindle.

[The US isn't the only power attempting to capitalize upon the upending
of a stable climate, with China hatching plans for a "polar silk road"
that will connect Chinese ports to Europe and beyond via a northern
shipping route as the Arctic becomes less dominated by ice.]{.underline}

"Climate change is shaping geopolitics even if leaders don't want to
admit it," said Sherri Goodman, an author and expert on the polar region
at the Wilson Center. "China is clear-eyed about the climate threat and
they will take advantage of that in access to resources and
infrastructure. We ignore this climate threat at our peril.

["[Trump]{.mark}, I think, [sees]{.mark} this [rush for **resources**
and climate change is making them more
**accessible**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It's interesting to see how
isolationist he was in his first term, now he seems almost imperialist.
It's hard to know where this will end up."

This scramble for resources, and the rise of nationalist leaders in
several countries including the US, has stoked fears of a sort of
rightwing environmentalism taking hold where wealthier countries trample
over those in vulnerable nations as climate disasters escalate.
Jean-Noël Barrot, France's foreign minister, warned last week: "We have
entered an era that is seeing the return of the law of the strongest."

Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and Panama have all rejected Trump's calls
for US assimilation. It's a sentiment many people living in these
places, often overlooked in the geopolitical wrangling, share. "Our
country is ours -- it's not for sale," said Ole Hjorth, 27-year-old air
traffic controller from Nuuk, Greenland. "Trump says a lot of things
that aren't very serious, but now it's become quite scary."

"We don't want to be American and these threats are really pushing
people in Greenland away from the Trump administration and the US," said
Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a Greenlandic politician who represents one of the
two seats that Greenland has in Denmark's parliament. "It's been quite
disrespectful how this has been handled."

Chemnitz Larsen, a supporter of Greenlandic independence from Denmark,
said there was [**enthusiasm** for new **economic
opportunities**]{.underline}, such as tourism and [even **rare earth
mining**]{.underline}, to diversify from traditional practices such as
fishing but that the climate crisis was a stark reality in realizing
this.

"Climate change is affecting everything in Greenland, we are seeing land
becoming exposed and also new species in the sea," she said. "For us,
climate change is real, there's no doubt that it's here and will become
more difficult for us in time."

over the next few decades. They projected that by 2065, the Arctic's
[navigability will **[increase]{.mark}** so greatly that it could
**yield** new [trade **routes**]{.mark} in **international**
waters]{.underline} --- not only [reducing the shipping **industry's**
carbon **footprint** but also **weakening** Russia's **control** over
**trade**]{.underline} in the Arctic.

The study was published on Monday, June 20, in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.

"There's no scenario in which melting ice in the Arctic is good news,"
said Amanda Lynch, the study's lead author and a professor of Earth,
environmental and planetary sciences at Brown. "But the unfortunate
reality is that the [ice is already **retreating**]{.underline}, these
[[routes]{.mark} are [**opening** up]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we [need
to start thinking **critically**]{.underline} about the legal,
environmental and geopolitical implications."

Lynch, who has studied climate change in the Arctic for nearly 30 years,
said that as a first step, she worked with Xueke Li, a postdoctoral
research associate at the Institute at Brown for Environment and
Society, to model four navigation scenarios based on four likely
outcomes of global actions to halt climate change in the coming years.
Their projections showed that unless global leaders successfully
constrain warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over the next 43 years, climate
change will likely open up several new routes through international
waters by the middle of this century.

One critical consequence of melting ice in the Arctic: the [potential
for **shorter**]{.underline}, [more eco-friendly **maritime**
trade]{.underline} routes that [bypass th]{.underline}e
Russian-controlled [Northern Sea **Route**]{.underline}, shown here in
green.

According to Charles Norchi --- director of the Center for Oceans and
Coastal Law at Maine Law, a visiting scholar at Brown's Watson Institute
for International and Public Affairs, and one of the study's co-authors
--- those changes could have [major **implications** for world **trade**
and global **politics**]{.underline}.

Norchi explained that since 1982, the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea has given Arctic coastal states [enhanced **authority**
over primary **shipping** routes]{.underline}. Article 234 of the
convention states that in the name of "the [prevention]{.underline},
**[reduction]{.underline}** and [control of marine pollution from
vessels]{.underline}," **[countries]{.underline}** whose coastlines are
near Arctic shipping routes have the [ability to **regulate** the
route's maritime **traffic**]{.underline}, so long as the area remains
ice-covered for the majority of the year.

Norchi said that for decades, [Russia]{.underline} has used Article 234
[for its own **economic** and geopolitical **interests**]{.underline}.
One Russian law requires all vessels passing through the Northern Sea
Route to be piloted by Russians. The country also [requires that passing
vessels pay **tolls** and provide advance **notice**]{.underline} of
their [plans]{.underline} to use the route. The heavy regulation is one
among many reasons [why major **shipping** companies often **bypass**
the route's heavy **regulations**]{.underline} and [high
costs]{.underline} and instead [use the **Suez** and **Panama**
canals]{.underline} --- [longer]{.underline}, [but cheaper and
easier]{.underline}, trade routes.

But as the [[ice]{.underline}]{.mark} near Russia's northern coast
[begins to **[melt]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Norchi said, [[so
will]{.mark} the [**country's** grip on **shipping**]{.mark} through the
Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.

"The Russians will, I\'m sure, continue to invoke Article 234, which
they will attempt to back up with their might," Norchi said. "But they
will be challenged by the international community, because Article 234
will cease to be applicable if there\'s no ice covered-area for most of
the year. Not only that, but with melting ice, shipping will move out of
Russian territorial waters and into international waters. If that
happens, Russia can't do much, because the outcome is driven by climate
change and shipping economics."

According to Lynch, previous studies have shown that [Arctic [routes are
**30%** to **50%** shorter]{.mark} than the Suez Canal and Panama Canal
routes]{.underline}, with [[transit **time**]{.mark} [reduced]{.mark} by
an estimated [**14** to **20** days]{.mark}]{.underline}. That means
that if international Arctic waters warm [enough to open up new
**pathways**]{.underline}, [shipping companies could **[reduce]{.mark}**
their greenhouse gas **[emissions]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} about
**[24%]{.mark}**]{.underline} while also [saving **money** and
**time**.]{.underline}

"These potential new Arctic routes are a [useful thing to consider when
you **recall** the moment]{.underline} when the [Ever Given ship was
stranded]{.underline} in the Suez Canal, blocking an [important shipping
**route** for several weeks]{.underline}," Lynch said.
"[[**Diversifying** trade routes]{.underline}]{.mark} --- especially
[[considering **new** routes]{.mark} that [**can't** be
**blocked**]{.mark}]{.underline}, because they're not canals ---
[[gives]{.underline}]{.mark} the [global **[shipping]{.mark}**

#### **Arctic sea routes** undermines the Panama Canal and reshapes global shipping patterns. **Guo et al. '22.** Guo, Jianke, Shu Guo, and Jing Lv. \"Potential spatial effects of opening Arctic shipping routes on the shipping network of ports between China and Europe.\" *Marine Policy* 136 (2022): 104885. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308597X21004966

According to statistics from the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), total maritime trade was 11.08 billion tons in
2019, with liner shipping carrying more than 80% of the world\'s total
merchandise trade \[2\], confirming that [[**maritime** transport plays
a crucial **role** in]{.mark} international trade in the context of
[**supply chain** globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mainlane
East--West containerized trade routes, namely Asia--Europe, one of the
busiest liner routes in the global shipping network, handled 23%
worldwide containerized trade flows in 2019 \[2\]. Connecting the
Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, the Suez Canal Route lies at the
crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa and is the most important route
between Asia and Europe. Twelve per cent of the world\'s cargo and 30
per cent of container trade is transported through the Suez Canal.
According to the Suez Canal Authority(SCA), nearly 19,000 ships passed
through the canal in 2020, an average of around 50 per day. The Suez
Canal has already been significantly affected by the surge in trade. The
grounding of a giant Panamanian cargo ship named Ever Given in March
2021 got stuck in the Suez Canal for six days in March, it dammed up
worldwide shipping and froze nearly \$10 billion in trade a day. For the
sea route from Asia to Europe, liner companies usually choose the Suez
Canal instead of the Cape of Good Hope when travelling between the Asian
and European markets. The reason for this is that a detour through the
Cape of Good Hope in South Africa would add approximately 10,000
kilometres to the voyage and cost an additional US\$470,000. With this
event, the advantage of the Suez Canal will be diminished when
considering the cost of congestion \[3\] and a new trade route between
the Asian and European markets will be the focus of attention.

[According to the monitoring and forecasting of sea ice melting
conditions in the Arctic performed by the NSIDC and NASA, it is believed
that [by 2035]{.mark}, sea **[ice]{.mark}** in the Arctic [will
have]{.mark} completely [**disappeared** and year-round
navigation]{.mark} in the Arctic will have [become a
**reality**]{.mark}. The accelerated [melting]{.mark} of Arctic sea ice
has greatly [increased]{.mark} the possibility of [establish]{.mark}ing
the [ASR]{.mark}. If the Arctic route is normalised, it would be one of
the [most convenient channels]{.mark} connecting Europe, Asia, and the
United States, as well as the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans,
[and]{.mark} would [revolutionise]{.mark} the world maritime [trade
pattern]{.mark} for the third time, [after]{.mark} the Suez Canal and
**[Panama Canal]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[4\]. The so-called Arctic route
is a combination of three shipping lanes: the Northeast Passage, which
starts from northern Europe and crosses the northern coastal region of
Russia to the east; the Northwest Passage, which starts from the Bering
Strait and crosses Canada and the United States to the east; and the
cross-polar route, which theoretically crosses the central region of the
Arctic Ocean directly to the Greenland Sea (Fig. 1).

With the concept of the 'Silk Road on Ice', the [[Arctic]{.mark} has
become a [focus]{.mark} of domestic and international
[attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to NASA satellite data, the
ASR was first opened in 2007. Then, in 2009, the successful voyage of
the German ships 'Friendship' and 'Vision' from Korea to the port of
Rotterdam marked the beginning of the commercial operation of the ASR
\[5\]. The following year, a cargo ship of the Norwegian shipping
company Chudi reached China via the **Northeast** Passage \[6\]. In
2013, the COSCO Shipping vessel 'Yongsheng' became the first Chinese
merchant vessel to take the Arctic route. From 2013--2017, COSCO
Shipping sent 10 vessels to the Northeast Passage of the Arctic route
and performed 14 voyages in total[. As of 2018, COSCO Shipping had
completed 22 voyages in the Northeast Passage of the Arctic, with a
total delivery volume of 619,981 ton]{.underline}s. According to Russian
statistics, the total cargo volume through the Arctic Ocean route in
2017 reached 9.7 million tons; 615 voyages passed through the Arctic
Ocean from the beginning of 2018 to July 15, 2018. In addition, the
Russian government approved numerous ships to use only the ASR and plans
to reach 80 million tons of currency per year in the ASR by 2040. [The
[trial]{.mark} [operation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} many countries in [Europe,
the United States, and Asia]{.mark} in the ASR has [accelerated]{.mark}
the **[normalisation]{.mark}** of Arctic route operation [and]{.mark}
further [promoted]{.mark} the [opening of the]{.mark} Arctic
[route]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fig. 2).

With the trial operation of various shipping companies in the Arctic,
the normalisation of the ASR has accelerated[. As a short and
economically viable route, the normalisation of the ASR will invariably
[affect]{.mark} the [traditional shipping structure]{.mark} and will
[change]{.mark} the flow direction of the world shipping organisation,
in addition to reshaping the spatial pattern of [shipping geography,
international trade, and world energy supply]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT: Zero Sum

#### China is undermining U.S. dominance in Latin America.

**Chen, C.-K. (2021).** Department of International Studies, Rhodes
College, Memphis, TN, USA. **China in Latin America Then and Now: A
Systemic Constructivist Analysis of China's Foreign Policy. Journal of
Current Chinese Affairs, 50(2),

published 2021)**

In addition to the debate about the "China threat" to Latin American
countries, there is also a [debate about [China becoming a
**challenger** to the US]{.mark} in the context of [China's **growing
presence** in Latin America]{.mark}. Some raise the concern about [China
as a rising revisionist state and the US as the dominant power]{.mark}
in our international system [conflicting]{.mark} with each other over
the region of Latin America]{.underline} (León-Manríquez, 2016). It is
found that, although China has not yet directly confronted the US in
Latin America, [it has been doing "[soft balancing]{.mark}" against the
US in order to [undermine its **dominance** over the region]{.mark}
through such non-military measures as active lending behaviour and
robust regional institution-building efforts]{.underline} (Yang and Lee,
2020). In addition, a survey of Chinese netizens reveals that [the idea
of [using]{.mark} the [countries in]{.mark} the [US's "**backyard**" to
counterbalance the US is very popular]{.mark} among the Chinese
people]{.underline} at least on the internet (Shen, 2012). Also, some
studies of the China--CELAC Forum that began in 2015 show that the
forum, though established as a multi-lateral institution, has [turned
into a regional "hub-and-spoke" system for China where it can easily
seize the leadership role and promote its international agenda vis-à-vis
other major powers]{.underline} (Jakóbowski, 2018).

#### Engagement is [zero-sum]{.underline} -- [China's power]{.underline} depends on [America's neglect]{.underline}. 

**Kreps and Flores-Macías 13** --- Sarah E. Kreps & Gustavo A.

Accessed: 07/15/2013)

To be sure, China may not have a purposeful plan to bring their trade
partners into alignment on foreign policy questions. [Even if
unintentional]{.underline}, however, this [**"gravitational effect**"
has a sound economic basis.]{.underline} Developing countries in Africa
and Latin America are comparatively much more dependent on China than
China is on these countries. In a ten year period, for example, Sudan's
trade with China rose from 1 to 10% of its Gross Domestic Product. That
pattern is even starker in a country like Angola, for which trade with
China represented 25% of its GDP in 2006. While China certainly needs
access to the resources in these countries, the individual countries are
far less important to China than China is to these countries. The
asymmetry in needs gives China a bargaining advantage that translates
into foreign policy outcomes even if not by explicit design. Whether by
design or not, the convergence with China's foreign policy goals is
important on at least two levels. First, developing countries in Africa
and Latin America may be lulled by the prospect of partnering with a
country such as China that does not have an explicit political agenda,
as did the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War, but this
appears to be an illusion. Whether this reaches the level of "new
colonialism" as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to it
remains to be seen, but the economic asymmetries that undergird the
relationship make that prospect more likely. A second set of
implications deals with the United States[. [During the same period in
which China's trade with]{.underline}]{.mark} Africa and **[[Latin
America]{.underline}]{.mark}** and foreign policy convergence [have
[increased, the United States and China have actually
diverged]{.mark}]{.underline} in their overall UNGA voting behavior.
[[This suggests something of a **zero sum** dynamic in which China's
growing trade relations make it easier to attract allies in
international forums while US influence is
diminishing]{.underline}.]{.mark} Taken together, these trends call for
greater engagement on behalf of the United States in the developing
world. [Since]{.underline} the September [2001]{.underline} attacks,
[[Washington has dealt with]{.underline}]{.mark} Africa and [[Latin
America through **benign neglect**]{.mark} and shifted its attention
elsewhere. If foreign policy alignment does follow from tighter
commercial relations, the US ought to reinvigorate its trade and
diplomatic agenda as an important means of projecting influence
abroad.]{.underline}

Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China
controls the canal.

\"[There is absolutely [no Chinese interference]{.mark} nor involvement
in anything to do with the Panama Canal,]{.underline}\" he said in late
December.

Panama Canal

[The Panama [Canal]{.mark} is a [vital]{.mark} global [trade
route]{.mark} for maritime commerce]{.underline}.

But in February, [[Panama]{.mark} decided [not]{.mark} to [renew]{.mark}
a key infrastructure [agreement with Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} after
a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Ahead of Mr. Trump\'s address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based
conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an
agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by
American company BlackRock.

Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"[The Panama [Canal]{.mark}
was [built by Americans for Americans]{.mark}, not for others. But
[others could use]{.mark} it,]{.underline}\" he said.

In his response, [[Mulino said]{.underline}]{.mark}, \"President Trump

\"[The Panama [Canal is not]{.mark} in the process of [being

discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone

[[China]{.mark} has [denied]{.mark} trying to [claim]{.mark} any

Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would

[Canal]{.mark} and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral
international waterway.\"]{.underline}

The history of Greenland

The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th
century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land
first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that
the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish
Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the
rule of Denmark\'s Nazi occupiers.

Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not
leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains
the American military\'s northernmost installation.

The history of the Panama Canal

[The Panama [Canal]{.mark} was [built by]{.mark} the [U.S]{.mark}.
between 1904 and 1914]{.underline}. It serves as a shortcut between the
Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes
from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.

[It was first [managed by the U.S. government]{.mark} for decades, which
caused tension with Panama.]{.underline}

In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the
permanent neutrality of the canal. [The U.S. committed to relinquishing
control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by
the Panama Canal Authority.]{.underline}

#### Panama will pivot to Chinese influence

JOW

[[Panama's interest]{.mark} in Chinese investments is rooted in several
[economic and strategic factors]{.mark}]{.underline}. These motivations
are shaped by Panama's role as a global trade hub, its strategic
geographic location, and its economic ambitions. Here's a breakdown:

1\. Enhancing Infrastructure Development

Modernizing Ports and Logistics: With the Panama Canal as a critical
artery of global trade, [Panama [seeks Chinese investments]{.mark} to
[modernize]{.mark} and expand its [port]{.mark} facilities]{.underline},
logistics hubs, and related infrastructure. [Chinese companies, such as
[China]{.mark} Harbour Engineering Company, have been [involved in port
projects]{.mark} in Panama,]{.underline} boosting its status as a
logistics powerhouse.

Expanding Transportation Networks: Chinese investment in roads,
railways, and airports complements Panama's infrastructure, facilitating
better connectivity within the country and with neighboring regions.

2\. Diversifying Economic Partnerships

Reducing U.S. Dependency: [While the U.S. remains a major trade and
investment partner, [Panama]{.mark} is [interested]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
diversifying its economic relationships. [Closer ties with China]{.mark}
provide a counterbalance and [reduce]{.mark} [reliance]{.mark} on any
single economic power.]{.underline}

Tapping into Chinese Expertise: Chinese firms often bring competitive
pricing, technological expertise, and experience in large-scale
projects, [making them attractive partners for Panama]{.underline}.

3\. Attracting Investment in Key Sectors

Energy: [[Chinese companies]{.mark} have shown [interest in renewable
energy]{.mark} projects, including solar and wind energy, which [align
with Panama's]{.mark} sustainability [goals]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Tourism: Chinese investments in hospitality and tourism infrastructure
aim to attract Chinese tourists, leveraging Panama's natural beauty and
its growing appeal as a global destination.

4\. Leveraging Free Trade Agreement Talks

[[Panama]{.mark} established diplomatic relations with China in 2017,
[end]{.mark}ing its [recognition of Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since
then, discussions on a potential free trade agreement (FTA) have been
underway. [An [FTA]{.mark} would further [enhance trade flows]{.mark}
and encourage more Chinese businesses to invest in Panama.]{.underline}

5\. Strengthening Financial Ties

Becoming a Financial Hub: [[Panama]{.mark} aims to [position]{.mark}
itself [as]{.mark} a [financial gateway]{.mark} for Chinese businesses
entering Latin America. Chinese banks, such as the [Bank of
China]{.mark}, have already established a [presence in]{.mark} the
[country]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Attracting Capital Flows: [[Chinese investment]{.mark} provides [access
to capital]{.mark} for large-scale projects, boosting Panama's economic
growth and job creation.]{.underline}

6\. Expanding Influence in Latin America

Geopolitical Positioning: [By engaging with China, [Panama
strengthens]{.mark} its [role as]{.mark} a bridge between Latin America
and Asia.]{.underline} It positions itself as a key player in China's

Potential Risks and Challenges

While Chinese investments bring significant benefits, [[Panama]{.mark}
must [navigate]{.mark} potential [risks]{.mark}, including]{.underline}:

[[Debt Dependence]{.mark}: Avoiding unsustainable debt levels linked to
large-scale Chinese infrastructure projects.]{.underline}

[[Strategic Vulnerabilities]{.mark}: Managing concerns over excessive
reliance on Chinese investments in critical sectors like ports and
telecommunications.]{.underline}

[[Balancing Relationships]{.mark}: Maintaining strong ties with the U.S.
while deepening economic engagement with China.]{.underline}

In summary, [[Panama views]{.mark} Chinese [investments as]{.mark} an
[opportunity]{.mark} to [modernize]{.mark} its [infrastructure]{.mark},
diversify its economy, and enhance its global standing.
[However]{.mark}, balancing these benefits with [potential]{.mark}
geopolitical and economic [risks remains]{.mark} a critical
[challenge]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Turns Case

#### Chinese influence is a financial and military conflict multiplier

[[China's interest]{.mark} in the Panama Canal [poses]{.mark} several
potential [threats]{.mark} to U.S. strategic, economic, and geopolitical
interests. The Panama [Canal is]{.mark} a critical [chokepoint]{.mark}
for global trade and a symbol of U.S. influence in the Western
Hemisphere. [Increased]{.mark} Chinese [involvement]{.mark} could
[undermine U.S. dominance]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline} Here are
the primary concerns:

---

1\. Strategic Control Over a Key Maritime Chokepoint

-- [[Disruption of U.S. Military and Trade Routes]{.underline}]{.mark}:
The Panama Canal is vital for U.S. military mobility, particularly for
transferring naval assets between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. If
China gains significant control or influence over canal operations, it
could potentially disrupt U.S. strategic movements.

-- [Leveraging Control During Conflicts]{.underline}: In a geopolitical
or military standoff, Chinese control could theoretically be used to
block or delay U.S. access to the canal, impacting both military and
commercial operations.

---

2\. Economic Risks to U.S. Trade

-- Influence Over Global Trade Routes: The Panama Canal is crucial for
U.S. trade, especially with Asia. Chinese influence could result in
preferential treatment for Chinese vessels or goods, potentially
disadvantaging U.S. shipping companies and increasing costs.

-- [[Economic Leverag]{.mark}e]{.underline}: By investing in canal
operations or infrastructure, China could use its position to influence
trade terms or extract concessions from the U.S. and other countries
dependent on the canal.

3\. Expansion of Chinese Geopolitical Influence

-- [[Undermining U.S. Influence in Latin America]{.underline}]{.mark}:
Increased Chinese involvement in Panama reflects Beijing's broader
strategy to expand its influence in Latin America, traditionally seen as
the U.S.'s sphere of influence. This challenges U.S. dominance and
erodes its diplomatic leverage in the region.

-- [Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline} (BRI): China's engagement in
Panama is part of its global BRI strategy, aimed at establishing trade
and infrastructure networks that connect China with key markets. By
integrating Panama into this network, China strengthens its foothold in
the Western Hemisphere.

---

4\. [[Potential Espionage and Cybersecurity Risks]{.underline}]{.mark}

-- [Data and Communications Vulnerabilities]{.underline}: If Chinese
companies gain control of port facilities, logistics hubs, or
telecommunications infrastructure linked to the canal, it could provide
opportunities for espionage or data interception.

-- [[Surveillance Risks]{.underline}]{.mark}: Infrastructure projects
often involve advanced technology systems, which could be used for
monitoring or surveillance activities in the region.

5\. Economic Dependency on China

-- Debt Diplomacy: Panama could become economically dependent on China
through large-scale infrastructure investments tied to the canal. This
could give Beijing undue influence over Panama's policies, potentially
aligning them with Chinese interests rather than U.S. priorities.

-- [[Erosion of Sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}: Chinese investment
often comes with strings attached, potentially compromising Panama's
ability to maintain neutral or pro-U.S. policies.

6\. Strategic Partnerships with Regional Rivals

-- [[Military Presence Concerns]{.underline}:]{.mark} While China does
not currently have a military presence in Panama, its investments could
pave the way for future military or quasi-military activities, such as
port access for Chinese naval vessels.

-- [Collaboration with Adversaries]{.underline}: Increased Chinese
presence in Panama could facilitate coordination with other U.S. rivals,
such as Russia, in undermining U.S. influence in the Americas.

---

7\. [Undermining U.S.-Panama Relations]{.underline}

-- Diplomatic Shifts: By establishing deeper economic ties with Panama,
China could weaken Panama's traditionally strong ties with the U.S.,
making it less likely to align with U.S. positions on global issues.

-- [[Economic Competition]{.underline}]{.mark}: Chinese investments
could outpace U.S. efforts in Panama, reducing American companies'
opportunities and influence in the region.

[China's growing [interest]{.mark} in the Panama Canal
[represents]{.mark} a [multifaceted challenge]{.mark} for the
U.S.,]{.underline} encompassing strategic, economic, and geopolitical
dimensions. [[To counter]{.mark} these threats, the [U.S.]{.mark} must
[strengthen]{.mark} its [presence in Panama]{.mark}, deepen economic and
diplomatic ties, and collaborate with regional partners [to
ensure]{.mark} the canal remains a [neutral and secure]{.mark}
asset]{.underline}. Balancing competition with China while safeguarding
U.S. Interests will require sustained attention and strategic action.

### IL -- Climate

#### Chinese control of Latin America pushes warming past the tipping point.

and Society at Brown University, co-author of A Fragmented Continent:

jx

[Latin America's evolving relationship with China was a central theme at
the recent III Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean
States (CELAC)]{.underline} in Costa Rica last month. [This followed the
first China-CELAC Forum held in Beijing in January which is regarded as
a significant upgrade to their partnership.]{.underline}

But while Latin American countries increasingly court the Asian giant as
a major trade and investment partner in the region, [there is another
side to Chinese-Latin American relations.]{.underline}

[[China's activities in Latin America]{.mark} tend to [focus on **high
carbon activities such as mining and fossil fuel extraction**. This may
be **entrenching high carbon development** pathways in Latin America and
**pulling the region in an unsustainable
direction.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark}'s relationship with Latin America may be [strengthening
the]{.mark} relative [power of domestic actors such as "dirty"
ministries]{.mark} (e.g. mining or energy) [in relation to environment
and climate change ministries]{.mark}. These [actors]{.mark} are [less
inclined to promote a]{.mark}n ambitious [climate agenda]{.mark}
compared to ministries of environment which are traditionally
marginalized.]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark} may be inadvertently **[undermining]{.mark} Latin
[America's attempts to advance climate change ]{.mark}**[policies by
reinforcing and strengthening actors within those countries that regard
action on climate change as an impediment to
growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[The rapidly expanding ties between China and Latin America have far
reaching implications for global efforts to confront climate
change.]{.underline}** Together, [[these countries account for roughly
36%]{.mark} (China 27% / CELAC 9%) [of]{.mark} total global greenhouse
gas [emissions]{.mark}. The world's ability to [stay\[ing\]
below]{.mark} a global average temperature increase of [two degrees this
century **will rest**]{.mark} in part **[on]{.mark}** the willingness of
**[these countries to reduce their emissions and shift to low-emission
economies.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

A new discussion paper produced by the Climate and Development Lab and
E3G looks beyond this framing of Chinese-Latin American relations by
exploring some of the opportunities for low carbon development.

It addresses four areas for improving China-Latin American cooperation
on low carbon development and climate change including renewable energy,
sustainable cities and reducing the environmental and carbon footprint
of Chinese-related activities in Latin America. It also looks at the
potential of the evolving international architecture for climate
finance, particularly the role of the new China-backed financial
institutions to help finance Latin American efforts to confront climate
change.

For example, [there is remarkable potential for China and CELAC to
cooperate on renewable energy. China's growing domestic renewable energy
market and influence in exporting technology to global renewable energy
markets presents excellent opportunities to invest in clean energy in
CELAC.]{.underline} The conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean
for renewable energy are encouraging with over a dozen countries having
established renewable energy targets. [The Inter-American Development
Bank says that the region can meet its future energy needs through
renewable energy sources]{.underline}, including solar, wind and
geothermal, which are sufficient to cover its projected 2050 electricity
needs 22 times over.

[The newly created China-CELAC Forum has the potential to be a
transformative platform to reverse the high-carbon partnership between
Latin America and China.]{.underline} CELAC should use the China-CELAC
Forum as a means to engage with China on taking action on climate change
within their bilateral partnerships and ensure that Chinese-Latin
American relations contribute positively towards efforts to create an
ambitious and equitable global climate agreement.

[The economic slowdown in Latin America and the Caribbean and China is
no excuse to undermine environmental or climate policies to attract
foreign investments for short terms gains]{.underline}. Instead [it
presents an opportunity to set Latin America and the Caribbean on the
path towards creating low-emission and resilient economies.]{.underline}
To that end, the China-CELAC Forum could prove pivotal to Latin American
and Caribbean countries' efforts to respond to climate change.

about]{.mark} potential avenues for [espionage]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Diplomatic Relations:

[relations with]{.mark} the People's Republic of [China]{.mark},
[shift]{.mark}ing [away from]{.mark} previous ties with

Notably, [[Chinese influence]{.mark} is increasingly [felt

The [[surge in]{.mark} Chinese [engagement]{.mark} in Latin America
[coincides with]{.mark} a regional [shift]{.mark} away from democracy

jx

The Trump administration is advancing the Golden Dome missile defense
initiative with a clear eye on the growing threat posed by China's
hypersonic weapons capabilities. Integrated with space technologies, the
Golden Dome is envisioned as a layered architecture for sensing,
tracking, and intercepting a range of aerial threats---including
ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles---from adversaries.

China's deployment of hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) presents a
formidable challenge to U.S. homeland security, propelled by advances in
thermal management, delivery platforms, and space-based support systems.
These HGVs can be launched from China's intercontinental ballistic
missiles---such as the DF-5, DF-31, and DF-41---capable of striking
targets anywhere within the continental United States.

While experts continue to debate the Golden Dome's projected \$175
billion price tag and raise concerns over its funding and operational
viability, [this analysis contends that any credible effort to
[shield\[ing\] the U.S.]{.mark} homeland [from China's long-range
missile threat must]{.mark} also [address]{.mark} the **expanding
footprint of [Chinese ground stations across Latin
America.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Latin America: **A critical frontier for Chinese ground
stations**]{.underline}

A comparison of active joint satellite initiatives and ground station
deployments suggests that [China places greater strategic emphasis on
establishing ground stations in Latin America.]{.underline} As of 2025,
China and regional partners jointly operate approximately four active
satellites---primarily for remote sensing and communications---including
two CBERS-4 satellites with Brazil, the VRSS-2 with Venezuela, and
TKSAT-1 with Bolivia. In contrast, China maintains at least eight ground
stations across the region, with facilities in Argentina (Neuquén and
Río Gallegos), Bolivia (Amachuma and La Guardia), Venezuela (El Sombrero
and Luepa), as well as in Chile (Cerro Calán), and Brazil (Alcântara).
Although China is not directly involved in the ground stations located
in Iquitos, Lima, Piura, Pucallpa, Puerto Maldonado, and Tacna, Peru
nonetheless maintains significant space cooperation with Beijing through
multilateral initiatives and satellite data-sharing agreements.

[China also plans to invest \$80 million in a major astronomical
observation base at Cerro Ventarrones, Chile, featuring an Extremely
Large Telescope and aiming for completion by 2028.]{.underline} However,
the project was suspended in March 2025 amid security concerns over its
sensitive location and the involvement of China State Construction
Engineering Corporation---[a firm designated by the U.S. as a **"Chinese
military company"---as the main contractor.**]{.underline}

[Ground stations facilitate **long-range precision strike
capability**]{.underline}

[[Ground stations are **central to China's remote sensing
architecture,** enabling real-time operations, reducing data latency,
and extending geospatial coverage.]{.mark} These assets [**enhance
China's situational awareness** over the U.S. homeland and **bolster the
PLA's kill chain effectiveness**]{.mark}: find, fix, track, target,
engage, and assess.]{.underline} [Recent Chinese military
activities---including hypersonic glide vehicle tests in 2021 and 2023,
and an intercontinental ballistic missile launch into the Pacific in
2024---underscore the [expanding reach of China's remote sensing
network, with ground stations serving as **its critical
backbone.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

China's deep space ground station in Neuquén, Argentina, underscores its
expanding technical reach. During the return of the Chang'e-5 (CE-5)
lunar probe on December 17, 2020, the station played a critical role in
tracking the mission's complex "skip reentry" maneuver---filling a key
gap in China's overseas Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
network. The telemetry data it provided was essential in calculating the
probe's reentry trajectory. This same high-precision orbit determination
capability could support the positioning of HGVs equipped with sensors
and advanced guidance algorithms---underlining how the return of CE-5
also validated the strategic potential of China's hypersonic precision
strike capabilities against the United States.

China's Expanding Dual-Use Influence in Latin America

[Recent analyses increasingly suggest that China's Belt and Road
Initiative [(BRI) serves]{.mark} not only economic purposes but also
[strategic and military objectives.]{.mark} Many BRI
[projects]{.mark}---ports, airports, and digital infrastructures---[are
dual-use by design and located at geopolitical chokepoints,]{.mark}
**extending the PLA's global reach.**]{.underline} **[[China's
infrastructure projects in Latin America are no
exception.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

China's Chancay mega port in Peru---financed by COSCO
Shipping---embodies the dual-use risks of BRI infrastructure. Marketed
as a commercial hub, its deep-water berths and advanced cranes could
support PLA Navy logistics near the Panama Canal. Similar concerns
surround Brazil's Paranaguá port and Ecuador's Manta port, which are
controlled by China Merchants Port Holdings and Hutchison Port Holdings
respectively, and operate under opaque agreements that raise red flags
over potential intelligence gathering and covert transfers.

A key player in China's BRI, [the PLA-linked and heavily subsidized
Huawei has deeply embedded itself in Latin America's digital
infrastructure.]{.underline} Offering below-market bids, it now supplies
70% of the region's 4G networks and leads in 5G deployment. Huawei also
operates major cloud data centers in Chile, Mexico, and Brazil, and has
built three critical submarine cables---South Atlantic Inter Link, Fiber
Optic Austral, and Topolobampo--La Paz---through its affiliate, HMN
Technologies.

In addition to ports and telecoms, [China is investing heavily in Latin
America's energy infrastructure.]{.underline} In Chile, state-owned
firms State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid now control
70% of the national transmission network. [This energy leverage could
strengthen Beijing's hand in negotiations over the suspended Cerro
Ventarrones ground station project. More broadly, [secure access to
logistics, data transmission, and electricity enhances the performance
of China's ground stations and remote sensing systems---**sharpening its
situational awareness near the U.S.** ]{.mark}**homeland.**]{.underline}

**[[The overlooked front in missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[War Control and Inadvertent Escalation]{.underline}

There is little evidence that technological entanglement is a direct,
strategic choice, but there are some limited indications that [[China
could use nuclear signaling to constrain the extent of conventional
conflicts]{.mark} and contribute to escalation control]{.underline}.25
Nuclear signaling includes such actions as test launches, release of the
locations of targets, an increase in readiness levels, missile
deployments, or other actions to demonstrate resolve. The goal would not
be necessarily to use nuclear weapons. Instead, the signaling would aim
to raise fears that a conflict could credibly escalate to the nuclear
level, thus "causing the enemy to dread that the possible consequences
of its actions will be that its losses will exceed its gains, thereby
causing the enemy to change its plans for risky activities and achieving
the goal of restricting the war to a certain scope."26 In this way,
[[China could **capitalize on the uncertainty of a potential nuclear
conflict**]{.mark} to deter intervention and constrain escalation in
conventional conflicts in the Pacific region. Such risks are compounded
by China's use of purposeful ambiguity as an integral component of its
approach to nuclear deterrence.]{.underline}27

**[One major problem is that [such signaling by the Chinese may be
indistinguishable from preparations for a nuclear
attack.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Yet, [[writings]{.mark} by experts on
deterrence and signaling operations f[ail to acknowledge that these
provocative actions could be misinterpreted by an
adversary.]{.mark}]{.underline} In general[, [Chinese experts seem to
believe that nuclear escalation is unlikely to be effectively
controlled]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} but are overconfident
that conventional conflict can be controlled without escalating to the
nuclear level.28 [[Lack of awareness about escalation risks could very
well make the **PLA more aggressive in local
conflicts.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Finally, the concept of an "existential threat" may be different in
China than many perceive it to be. The PLA is not China's professional
military so much as it is the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party,
a point drilled into PLA members and emphasized in the era of Chinese
President Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the party.29 [In
that sense, **destruction of the party may be synonymous with
destruction of the state.** Such conflation of ideas could come into
play in the face of a humiliating conventional defeat by China over
Taiwan or another dispute that China considers central to its
sovereignty. [If there were a perceived risk,]{.mark} irrational or not,
that such [losses could fracture the legitimacy of the]{.mark} Communist
[Party, drastic actions could become more likely.]{.mark} If
[Beijing]{.mark} perceived that nuclear weapons use would ensure victory
in a conflict, it [might **escalate to using nuclear weapons** in a
last-ditch effort.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[U.S.]{.mark} policymakers and military officials have [raise]{.mark}d
[concerns]{.mark} about [China's growing presence in Latin
America]{.mark}]{.underline} even as Washington remains focused
elsewhere, especially on major ongoing conflicts in Europe and the
Middle East. "[[China's]{.mark} growing [presence]{.mark} poses a
[direct challenge to]{.mark} U.S. [dominance]{.mark} in the
region,]{.underline}" the Atlantic Council's Enrique Millán-Mejía wrote
in May 2025. "[For the United States, failure to recalibrate its
approach to regional diplomacy risks further [alienation and erosion of
soft power]{.mark} in its traditional sphere of influence.]{.underline}"
During his first term in office, President Trump took a more hard-line
approach than his predecessors by imposing sanctions on several
countries, including Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and slashed aid to
others, most prominent being the so-called Northern Triangle countries
in Central America. Some [analysts say these [actions drove]{.mark}
certain governments [closer to China]{.mark}. [Trump]{.mark} also
[step]{.mark}ped [back from]{.mark} trade [relations]{.mark} with the
region, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.]{.underline}

President Biden, who took the lead on Latin America policy during his
tenure as vice president to Barack Obama, long argued that the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates should [renew]{.mark} its [leadership
role]{.mark} in the region [to counter]{.mark} a rising
[China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Calling China a "strategic competitor"
\[PDF\] and pledging to strengthen U.S. partnerships in the Western
Hemisphere, Biden launched Build Back Better World (B3W) in 2021 with
his Group of Seven (G7) counterparts. The initiative aimed to counter
China's BRI by developing infrastructure in low- and middle-income
countries, including in Latin America. However, the Biden administration
committed only \$6 million to B3W in its first year, and it was later
renamed the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. At the
2022 Summit of the Americas, Biden announced a range of new economic
initiatives, including the creation of the Americas Partnership for
Economic Prosperity, which seeks to make the region more economically
competitive.

Additionally, [the [Biden]{.mark} administration [sought]{.mark} to
shore up [support]{.mark} for [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} and continued
to raise concerns about Huawei. Still, some experts argue Biden didn't
focus enough on the region, particularly with regard to trade. The 2024
annual report \[PDF\] by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government, underscored
the challenges that Beijing's growing influence in Latin America poses
to Washington.

Meanwhile, bipartisan legislation introduced by then Senator Bob
Menendez (D-NJ) and then Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) in 2022 sought to
counter China's "malign influence" in the region by strengthening
multilateral security cooperation and counternarcotics efforts. Other
legislative proposals include calls for the United States to create
permanent trade partnerships with countries in the Western Hemisphere to
encourage the "reshoring" of supply chains from China to countries
closer to home. Neither bill advanced in Congress.

[In his second term, President [Trump]{.mark} has taken a more
[assertive approach]{.mark} to [counter]{.mark}ing [China's]{.mark}
regional [influence]{.mark}. He has repeatedly alleged that
[China]{.mark} secretly [controls]{.mark} the Panama
[Canal]{.mark},]{.underline} despite Panamanian ownership, and
threatened to retake the waterway, which the United States handed over
to Panama in 1999. [The Trump administration has also wielded tariffs,
imposing a baseline [10 percent tariff]{.mark} on most countries,
including those [in Latin America]{.mark}]{.underline}, with higher
tariffs on Mexico due to concerns related to immigration and drug
trafficking. Many experts believe such measures will end up hurting the
U.S. economy and ceding some trade to China. Trump's focus on border
control could also spell problems for Latin American countries, [as
[many depend on]{.mark} remittances from the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates to [boost]{.mark} their [economies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

JOW

[It is [imperative]{.mark} for research to [consider Latin America
as]{.mark} an emerging [arena of]{.mark} strategic [competition]{.mark}
between the United States and China for several compelling reasons.
Firstly, Latin America [holds]{.mark} invaluable [natural
resources]{.mark} and burgeoning markets crucial for powering the growth
of global superpowers. In the early to mid-2000s, Latin America
[play]{.mark}ed a [pivotal role in fueli]{.mark}ng rapid
[economic]{.mark} [growth]{.mark} across emerging markets, [notably
China]{.mark}, [thanks to]{.mark} its abundant [commodities]{.mark} such
as oil, minerals, metals, and agricultural products.]{.underline} Today,
Latin America once again [takes center stage in global economic
importance due to its critical role in the transition to renewable
energy]{.underline}. Countries like Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia,
forming "the lithium triangle," possess over 60 percent of the world's
lithium reserves, a mineral essential for battery production. Brazil
alone holds 17 percent of global nickel reserves, while Peru and Chile
are the world's primary copper suppliers.24 Latin America's significant
state ownership of mineral deposits empowers regional governments to
make political calculations and assess geopolitical alignments when
granting access to these vital resources. For instance, [in January
2023, [Bolivia grant]{.mark}ed [exclusive lithium]{.mark} mining [rights
to]{.mark} the world's largest reserves to [Chinese]{.mark} battery
corporation CATL, choosing them [over US]{.mark} and Russian
competitors.25 This [decision follows]{.mark} years of [democratic
backsliding]{.mark} in Bolivia and a 2019 election that the Organization
of American States deemed "impossible to validate" due to "intentional
manipulation and serious irregularities]{.underline}."26 The leverage
that Latin American countries possess in determining which nations can
access these critical minerals will play a [pivotal role in shaping the
outcomes of great-power competition]{.underline}.

Secondly, [[Latin America's proximity to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has [prompt]{.mark}ed Chinese [interest in]{.mark}
establishing a physical [military presence]{.mark} in the region,
potentially contributing to kinetic conflicts]{.underline}. Relations
between the United States and Latin American nations, particularly
authoritarian states like Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, are
increasingly strained. [Recent [intelligence]{.mark} has [revealed
plans]{.mark} for collaboration [between China and Cuba]{.mark}, an
enduring authoritarian stronghold, to [create]{.mark} a [joint military
training facility]{.mark}, complementing the four joint eavesdropping
stations already operating on the island]{.underline}. Additionally,
secret negotiations have transpired between China and Nicaragua's
authoritarian President Daniel Ortega to construct a deep-water port off
Nicaragua's coast capable of serving as a naval outpost. 27 [The
existence and [plans]{.mark} for additional Chinese military bases in
the Western Hemisphere not only directly [challenge the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates' traditional [sphere of influence]{.mark} but [also
threaten]{.mark} its national [security]{.mark}]{.underline}, stemming
from the vast oceanic buffers that historically separated it from
rivals. [The presence of a near-peer adversary's military within a
hundred miles of the US coastline would represent the [most
significant]{.mark} [escalation]{.mark} in strategic competition
[since]{.mark} the [Cuban missile crisis]{.mark} of 1962.]{.underline}

Furthermore, it is [crucial to consider that [Chinese control]{.mark}
over Latin America's critical logistical chokepoints,]{.underline} vital
for both commercial and wartime operations, co[uld [disrupt]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' home front and military
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Latin America serves as a pivotal
global economic and military corridor that connects North and South
America, as well as the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Panama
Canal and the Strait of Magellan. [The Panama [Canal]{.mark}, in
particular, is [indispensable]{.mark} to [global trade]{.mark}, with
more than USD 270-billion worth of goods traversing it annually, serving
more than 140 maritime routes to over 80 countries.28 Although the
United States ranks as the canal's largest user, [Panama governs the
waterway]{.mark} and leases ports to the highest bidder. The rapid
[expansion of Chinese]{.mark} economic [investments]{.mark} in the
region [create]{.mark}s conditions for a political [regime]{.mark} less
aligned with U.S. interests, thereby granting greater [authority to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. A Hong Kong--based subsidiary already
manages two major ports on the Canal's Pacific and Atlantic outlets.29
Ultimately, the [[prolif]{.mark}eration [of]{.mark}
[Chinese]{.mark}-controlled [ports]{.mark} in the region could be
leveraged to severely [impede US freedom of navigation]{.mark} and
hinder military efforts to reposition naval forces to the Pacific during
wartime.]{.underline}

Thirdly, the [prevailing trend of [democratic backsliding]{.mark} in
Latin America could [disrupt]{.mark} a delicate [geopolitical]{.mark}
[balance]{.mark} and further bolster China's assertiveness.]{.underline}
As previously alluded to in the discussion of BRICs, [Latin American
countries that are experiencing democratic erosion have increasingly
embraced principles of noninterference and nonalignment in [support of
China's global aspirations]{.mark} to expand diplomatic partnerships and
economic ties. In essence, as the [region deepens]{.mark} its [relations
with China]{.mark},]{.underline} neutrality increasingly aligns with
complicity in international law violations and attacks on democratic
institutions. The [[implications]{.mark} of these shifts]{.underline},
coupled with growing regional diplomatic realignments from Taiwan to
China, [could [have]{.mark} far-reaching [consequences]{.mark},
including the [potential for]{.mark} a [Chinese invasion of]{.mark}
democratic [Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}30 In essence, [there appears to
be a circular, reinforcing, and self-sustaining [relationship between
democratic backsliding]{.mark} in Latin America [and]{.mark} both
[Chinese empowerment]{.mark} and anti-liberal tendencies on the
international stage]{.underline}. In the subsequent sections, we
elucidate our unique contribution to our understanding of this
relationship, specifically delving into how Latin American alignment
with China translates into domestic democratic changes.

[[Criticism]{.mark} of the agency has [ranged from its foreign
policy]{.mark} agenda [to]{.mark} its
[inefficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2014, USAID was accused of
secretly creating a "Cuban Twitter" called ZunZuneo to stir unrest and
undermine the Cuban government. USAID denied the charge. In 2023,
Mexico\'s President asked the US to stop USAID from funding groups
hostile to his government "contrary to international law."

[Western [writers]{.mark} had [noted]{.mark} that [China\'s influence in
Latin ***America***]{.mark} and sub-Saharan Africa [has been
growing]{.mark}]{.underline}. It had become an increasingly important
trading partner and investor in recent years. [In October 2024, the
[China Development Bank]{.mark} (CDB) [announced that it had
provided]{.mark} about US\$ [160 billion to]{.mark} help finance
[hundreds of projects throughout Latin ***America***.]{.mark} Closing of
USAID would thus be a boon to China]{.underline}.

Writing in The Guardian, Helen Davidson and Amy Hawkins, quote Prof
Huang Yanzhong, senior fellow for global health at the Council on
Foreign Relations as saying that what ***[Trump]{.underline}*** is doing
is basically providing China a perfect opportunity to rethink, to renew
***[soft power]{.underline}*** projects, and get back on track to trans
global leadership. More than one analyst described the shuttering of
USAID as a "self-inflicted wound".

[In 2018, the Chinese government created the standalone China
International Development Cooperation Agency, or China Aid, to
streamline China\'s spending, including its foreign investment
programme]{.underline}, the belt and road initiative (BRI). Beijing
doesn\'t disclose foreign aid budgets but a study by William & Mary\'s
Global Research Institute found China lent US\$ 1.34 trillion to
developing nations between 2000 and 2021, mostly through the BRI.

[While [China Aid operates differently]{.mark} to USAID, by

[[Recent statements by]{.mark} U.S. President Donald **[Trump]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} Special Envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver
**[Carone]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as the trip by Secretary of
State Marco Rubio to Central America, have [[focused attention
on]{.mark} the [**risks** posed by]{.mark} the activities of [**China**
in Panama]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Two points should be made clear at the outset. First, [the United States
turned the canal over to Panama through a properly ratified series of
two treaties]{.underline} whose legal validity is generally not in
question, however much [some may question the wisdom of the U.S.
government in agreeing to them.]{.underline}

Second, since Panama assumed responsibility for operations on December
31, 1999, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has done a reasonably good
job administering the waterway. The ACP has generally charged rates for
canal passage that do not discriminate by the country owning the ship,
although U.S. warships receive special priority, while military ships
from Colombia, by a separate treaty, pass through the canal for free.

With respect to China, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) does maintain
relationships with Panama's Border Protection service, its Air and Naval
Service, and its National Police, including training members of those
organizations in China. In 2023, [**[Beijing]{.mark}** also
[donated]{.mark} over [6,000 **military** vests]{.mark} and helmets [to
Panama]{.mark}'s security services]{.underline}, although in the wrong
color for Panama's uniforms, and many have since broken down.

[Aside from China's low key military engagement with Panama, [the real
issue is the **scope** of]{.mark} its **[commercial presence]{.mark}**
there.]{.underline} For example, [China-based logistics giant
[**Hutchison** operates ports on both]{.mark} the Atlantic and Pacific
[sides of the canal]{.mark},]{.underline} two of the five port
operations there. Beyond just the ports, [[China's **economic**
**engagement** and **development** of]{.mark} networks of [personal
influence]{.mark} and benefit in Panama have]{.underline} arguably
[facilitated its use of the country as a global logistics and financial
hub to [promote its commercial advance in the region]{.mark} under
conditions of limited transparency, [with]{.mark} numerous [**shady**
dealings]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Shortly [after then-Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela's decision
to recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC), documents reportedly
leaked from his WhatsApp account showed a financial windfall in
China]{.underline} for the liquor export business owned by his brother,
although a quid pro quo regarding the family liquor business was never
proven. Varela quietly worked to limit China's presence in other areas,
such as the electricity sector.

Varela's successor, Nito Cortizo, initiated a review of projects with
China-based companies begun by his predecessor, which ultimately limited
these deals in important ways. However, [[in 2021]{.mark}, the Cortizo
government [renewed **Hutchison**'s concession to **operate**
the]{.mark} Cristobal and Balboa [**ports** under]{.mark} extremely
[generous terms and]{.mark} under [**non-transparent**
conditions]{.mark}.]{.underline} That [[raised]{.mark} serious
[questions about]{.mark} Hutchison's [**influence** with **Panama**'s
government]{.mark}s [and]{.mark} its [ability to **exploit** it]{.mark},
whether to support China's commercial advance or (hypothetically) [in a
**time of war**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Beyond ports, the [China-based [logistics giant **COSCO**]{.mark}, which
has supported the PLA in Libya, Yemen, and elsewhere throughout the
world as [part of China's **military-civil fusion**]{.mark} concept, has
a significant, longstanding relationship with the ACP as [one of
the]{.mark} Panama [Canal's biggest users and most important
customers]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[China-based companies]{.mark} are active across the country in
construction projects]{.underline}, including construction of an
enormous convention center by [China Construction Americas, which was
subject to a \$1.6 billion civil judgment for **[corruption]{.mark}**
and malfeasance on a separate project. Chinese projects also include a
new cruise ship port near Panama City, and a new \$1.52 billion
**bridge** over the canal.]{.underline} China-based [**[Huawei]{.mark}**
has its regional **headquarters** in Panama [and a major role in]{.mark}
the [**digital infrastructure** in the country]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Numerous other China-based companies also have major regional logistics
operations in special zones near Colon and Panama Pacifico, among
others.

The [China-based company **[Jiangxi]{.mark}** was the purchaser of 30
percent of Panamanian copper from the Cobre Panama mine, which
[accounted for **5 percent** of the country's
**GDP**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The mine closed in 2023, but there is the
possibility that it will be reopened by the current government.

Under the Varela government, [**[Panama]{.mark}** began
[negotiating]{.mark} a **[f]{.mark}**ree **[t]{.mark}**rade
**[a]{.mark}**greement (FTA) [with **Beijing**]{.mark}, which would have
[expand]{.mark}ed China's commercial [**presence**,
**influence**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} people-to-people [networks]{.mark}
even further]{.underline}. Although the talks did not continue under
Cortizo, [the present government of Jose Raul Mulino has indicated an
**interest** in re-opening FTA **negotiations** with China.]{.underline}

As suggested by the aforementioned examples, beyond Panama's government,
virtually [all of Panama's most influential families have business
dealings with PRC-based companies.]{.underline} [Since the Varela
government recognized the PRC in 2017, **[Chinese
organizations]{.mark}** have [issued invitations to]{.mark} individual
Panamanian academics, businesspeople, **[politicians]{.mark}**,
journalists, **[government officials]{.mark}**, and others to travel [to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, [while the International Liaison Department
of the **[C]{.mark}**hinese **[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty
has actively courted businesspeople, government officials, and others in
Panama. China's **[efforts]{.mark}** have created a
**[worrisome]{.mark}** web of [relationships]{.mark} of interest, with
the [potential to be **exploited**]{.mark} by Beijing [for
**information**, favors, or **other purposes**]{.mark}.]{.underline} I
[personally knew former Panamanian **officials**, the same people
responsible for negotiating their country's interests with Beijing,
whose own education in China was paid for by Chinese
government]{.underline} (Hanban) [scholarships.]{.underline}

Beyond supporting Beijing's commercial and political objectives,
[[China's combination of **presence**, **influence**, and compromising
relationships]{.mark} with[in Panama's **government** and **business
community**]{.mark} gives it numerous opportunities that it
[could]{.mark} exploit to [**shut down** the canal]{.mark} in deniable
ways, [or]{.mark} otherwise [use against the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [in a **time of conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Panamanian government and the United States both take their
responsibilities under Article IV of the 1977 Carter-Torrijos Treaty to
protect and defend the Panama Canal very seriously, as evidenced by the
annual Panamax exercise, focused on protecting canal operations, one of
the biggest multilateral exercises in the region, involving 20 nations.
However, [[China's **access** to the canal]{.mark} -- from its
significant number of commercial **operations** and **personnel** in the
country -- [and]{.mark} associated **[technical knowledge]{.mark}**
available to Chinese companies from their operations in Panama, simply
[creates too many **opportunities** for Beijing to target]{.mark} the
canal [in **wartime**]{.mark}. [It's **impossible** to]{.mark}
completely [**protect** against them all]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Examples include **staging** an **accident**]{.mark} to sink or
disable one of the numerous **vessels** transiting the canal in a narrow
passage such as the Culebra Cut, **[destroying]{.mark}** one of the
**[bridges]{.mark}** spanning the canal]{.underline} (just as the March
2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore blocked
access to the city's for days), [[**sinking** a **ship**]{.mark} in the
locks themselves, or **[detonating explosives]{.mark}** concealed in a
ship's hull while transiting the locks. China could also [**attack**
lock **control systems**]{.mark}, or associated water management
systems, through either physical or cybernetic attacks. Groups deniably
independent from Beijing could mine part of the canal zone, or present
risks to ships awaiting transit through the canal, just as the Houthis
did to significantly impede transits through the Red Sea and Suez Canal
in 2024. These methods could allow for **plausible deniability** as
well, claiming accidental damage.]{.underline}

Managing the risk of attacks against the canal requires limiting the
access and knowledge of parties such as China with an interest in
shutting it down in wartime.

The 1989 U.S. military intervention to remove Panamanian narco-president
Manuel Noriega reminds Panamanians that there is precedent for U.S.
action when it perceives its core strategic interests regarding the
Canal Zone are at stake, aside from the legal issues. [**[Military
action]{.mark}**, however, would be a **tragedy** in terms of Panamanian
and U.S. lives, costs and economic impacts, as well as in its long-term
costs. Action against Panama could **[incentivize]{.mark}** other
[**countries** to **hedge** against the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates, possibly [deepening their **embrace** of
**adversaries** such as **China**, **Russia**, and
**Iran**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There is a clear path to protecting U.S. and global interests in fair
and unimpeded operation of the Panama Canal, while also respecting
Panama's sovereignty, international law, and treaty commitments: The
U.S. and Panama must together double-down on reinforcing transparency

[The **[Panama Canal]{.mark}**, a monumental feat of engineering and a
[**linchpin** of global **trade**]{.mark}]{.underline}, has once again
taken center stage in geopolitical discussions. Recently, former
President Donald [Trump raised [**concerns** about the canal's
**management** and]{.mark} its [strategic **importance** to the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, suggesting a
possible demand for its return to U.S. control.

The [Panama Canal: A Vital Economic and Strategic Asset]{.underline}

Facilitating [6% of global maritime trade, [the]{.mark} Panama [Canal is
a **cornerstone** of international **commerce**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Approximately 40% of U.S. container traffic relies on this route
annually, with [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as the canal's
largest user]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2021, [over [**73%** of all
**vessels**]{.mark} transiting the canal were destined for or departing
[from **U.S. ports**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Opened in 1914 after a monumental U.S.-led construction effort[, [the
canal]{.mark}'s significance lies in its ability to [drastically
**reduce** transit **times** between]{.mark} the [**Pacific** and
**Atlantic**]{.mark} Oceans. [This efficiency enhances U.S. trade
**competitiveness**,]{.mark} [underscoring the canal's **critical** role
in global supply chains.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Historical Context: The Handover and Its Implications

In 1999, the Panama Canal transitioned to Panamanian control under the
Torrijos-Carter Treaties, negotiated during President Jimmy Carter's
administration. While celebrated as a diplomatic milestone, the transfer
has remained controversial among some U.S. policymakers, who view it as
a strategic misstep.

Trump's recent remarks highlight lingering concerns over this decision.
On his Truth Social platform, he described the canal as a "vital
national asset," emphasizing its [importance to the U.S. **economy** and
**security**.]{.underline} Trump's rhetoric includes a threat to demand
the canal's return if American interests are not adequately safeguarded.

Economic and Strategic Concerns

Central to Trump's critique is the [high toll fees imposed on American
shipping and the canal's strategic management.]{.underline} Beyond
economic considerations, [broader [anxieties about **China's** regional
**influence**]{.mark} have [amplified]{.mark} these
[concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since Panama's 2017 diplomatic
recognition of China over Taiwan, [[Beijing has **expanded**]{.mark} its
[**presence** in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}, investing heavily in
infrastructure projects near the canal.

[**[China]{.mark}**'s influence includes [**control** over **ports** at
both ends of the canal]{.mark}]{.underline} through Hutchison Ports PPC,
a Hong Kong-based company with ties to Beijing. This control has sparked
fears about potential manipulation of canal operations, threatening the
neutrality enshrined in the Neutrality Treaty. U.S. Southern Command has
also voiced concerns, warning that Chinese investments could compromise
the canal's impartiality and security.

Security Implications

In addition to logistical control, there are fears that [China [could
**embed** **surveillance** technology within the canal's
infrastructure]{.mark}, [enabling **espionage** against U.S.
**naval**]{.mark} and **commercial** [operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[This potential surveillance capability [poses significant
**risks**]{.mark}, [providing]{.mark} critical [**insights** into U.S.
**logistics** and military movements.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Challenges to Reclaiming Control

Reclaiming the Panama Canal would face significant legal and diplomatic
hurdles. The Neutrality Treaty, which guarantees the canal's impartial
operation, obligates the United States to respect Panamanian
sovereignty. Any unilateral move to regain control would breach
international law and strain U.S. relations in Latin America.

Moreover, Panama has demonstrated effective management of the canal,
including a 2016 expansion that doubled its capacity to accommodate
larger vessels. Despite these advancements, Trump's statements
underscore the canal's enduring importance to U.S. interests and the
need for vigilance in ensuring secure and reliable access.

Balancing Geopolitical Dynamics

As global trade routes evolve, the Panama Canal remains a focal point of
U.S. foreign policy. Navigating the interplay of American strategic
interests, Panamanian sovereignty, and China's regional influence will
require a nuanced approach. [Maintaining the canal's **neutrality** and
operational **efficiency** is essential for safeguarding supply chain
**stability** and international **commerce**.]{.underline}

In this era of shifting geopolitical landscapes, [the [Panama
Canal]{.mark}'s role as a critical maritime route underscores its
[continued **relevance** to global **trade** and U.S. national
**security**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The Panama Canal is [key]{.underline} to global trade\-\--the US must take the lead against China.

[[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark} is a small country that [[plays a big role
in **global commerce**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The country\'s most iconic
attraction is [[the **Panama Canal**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
engineering marvel that [[has become]{.mark} a [**flash point**
for]{.mark} global [trade **tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Canal is a highly strategic 51-mile waterway that connects the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  [[It enables ships]{.mark} to
avoid]{.underline} the [**lengthy** and **hazardous** route around Cape
Horn]{.underline}, thereby [**dramatically** cutting down shipping
times]{.underline}. 

[[The waterway accounts for]{.mark} almost [**6%** of global maritime
trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, servicing 144 maritime routes [used by more
than **150** nations.  Around **14,000** ships pass]{.underline} through
the canal [each year, [carrying over 500 million tons of **food**,
**minerals** and **factory-made** products]{.mark}]{.underline}.  About
[**[\$270 billion]{.mark}** in cargo is handled
[annually]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is the **largest user**]{.mark} of the Panama Canal.  About
[**three-quarters** of traffic]{.mark}]{.underline} passing through the
isthmus [either departed from or [is]{.mark} heading to [U.S.
ports]{.mark}]{.underline}.  Trade between Asia and the U.S. east coast
accounts for 42% of the Canal's total traffic.

[[China]{.mark} and Hong Kong'[s influence in]{.mark} global maritime
[supply chains has been **growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as companies
from those countries hold significant stakes in key shipping
infrastructure like the Panama Canal.  [A [Hong-Kong]{.mark}-based
corporation [controls **two** of]{.mark} the [four major
ports]{.mark}]{.underline} surrounding the waterway; [[this is]{.mark}
perceived by the]{.underline} new [U.S.]{.underline} Administration [as
[a]{.mark} potential [**threat** to American
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pressure has been applied to reduce this
perceived security risk.

As a result, a Hong Kong-based company recently struck an agreement to
sell shares of its facilities to a consortium led by a major American
firm for close to \$23 billion.  But the deal has drawn the ire of
Chinese authorities.

High transit tariffs have also become a focal point for the Trump
administration.  It has alleged that canal fees violate the [Permanent
Neutrality
Treaty](https://pancanal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/neutrality-treaty.pdf),
which requires transit fees to be "just, reasonable, equitable and
consistent with international law." 

Operators of the port note that two years of record drought led to a
major reduction in water levels in the Gatun Lake, the reservoir that
supplies the canal.  This forced the authorities to implement
restrictions on ship traffic, leading to record-high transit fees,
longer transit times and disruptions to global trade.  In late 2023,
only 22 ships crossed the canal each day instead of the usual 36.

Beijing had extended its national security laws to Hong Kong in 2020. 
This is also a concern for the U.S. Under the laws, mainland authorities
can seek information from Hong Kong companies for monitoring shipping
and the strategic positions of naval vessels.

A [[conflict over]{.mark} control of [the]{.mark} Panama [Canal would be
**disastrous** to]{.mark} international [supply
chains]{.mark}]{.underline}.  A [[triumph]{.mark} of engineering [is at
risk of becoming]{.mark} a [**tragic symbol** of]{.mark} global [trade
**frictions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In his inaugural address, Donald Trump declared that one of his
administration's [priorities](https://apnews.com/article/rubio-trump-panama-canal-greenland-cf950b07453035d3e25d23807bc136e8) would
be to regain control of the Panama Canal. This claim reopens a
century-old debate over who built it, who lost it, and who truly owns
this 80-kilometer engineering marvel that stitches together the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans. [With over **140** maritime routes, **1,700** ports,
and **160** countries linked through it, [the Canal is a
**key [artery](https://pancanal.com/canal-de-panama-es-conectividad/#:~:text=Por%20eso%2C%20el%20Canal%20de,a%20la%20prosperidad%20de%20Panam%C3%A1.)** of
global trade]{.mark}]{.underline}.

I visited the Canal a few years ago, and, beyond its logistical genius,
what struck me the most was its turbulent history.

French Vision, American Execution, Caribbean Workers

In 1869, fresh off his success with the Suez Canal, French diplomat
Ferdinand de Lesseps set his sights on Central America. He was
determined to carve a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, which was
then part of Colombia.

This would be one of the 19th century's most ambitious infrastructure
projects.

A [report](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1879/07/26/the-panama-canal) in The
Economist from 1879 called it "a bolder enterprise even than the Suez
Canal," predicting the logistical, technical, and health nightmares
ahead. As if they had a crystal ball, the project collapsed just a
decade later, sunk by financial ruin, yellow fever, and an engineering
failure. Lesseps's Panama Canal Company would be bankrupt by 1888.

Yet where the French had failed, the United States saw an opportunity.
Invoking the [Monroe
Doctrine](https://www.britannica.com/event/Monroe-Doctrine)---a US
foreign policy that justified American influence in Latin America while
keeping the continent off-limits to European colonial
ambitions---Washington backed Panama's independence from Colombia in
1903. It then secured the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty granting it full
control over the Canal's construction and operation. Nearly [40,000
workers](https://bdigital.binal.ac.pa/bdp/tomoXXIXP3.pdf) from the
Caribbean---mostly from Barbados---were recruited to build the Canal.
And in August 1914, just as World War I erupted, the Panama Canal
opened, redrawing the map of global trade.

[Without the Canal, global shipping routes would be **significantly**
different]{.underline}. Before 1914, ships traveling the east and west
coasts of the American Continent faced a long and dangerous journey.
[[The Canal slashed **fuel consumption**, cut **transit times**, and
made]{.mark} global [trade more **efficient**]{.mark} than
ever]{.underline}.

Today, a San-Francisco--New-York voyage has [five possible
routes](https://sea-distances.org/) by sea. The fastest? Through the
Panama Canal---10 days, 23 hours. The next-best option? A 27-day detour
around the Strait of Magellan.

The Canal Moves the World... But at What Cost?

For much of the 20th century, the Panama Canal was a [geopolitical chess
piece](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/panama-canal-helped-make-u-s-world-power).
The Canal Zone was US territory and a flashpoint for anticolonial
sentiment in Central America. By the 1960s and '70s, Panamanian
resentment escalated, culminating in the 1964 Flag Riots. Clashes
between Panamanians and US forces resulted in multiple casualties.

In 1977, the Torrijos-Carter Treaties established a phased transition
plan that transferred control of the Canal to Panama by 1999, marking a
major shift in US-Panama relations. Trump has called this handover
"foolish," blaming President Jimmy Carter for giving away a trade
goldmine. At the time, the decision was intended to reduce anti-American
sentiment in Latin America.

Today, [[the]{.mark} Panama [Canal is a **vital** economic
force]{.mark}]{.underline}. Managed by a private entity, it generates
roughly 4% of Panama's GDP, through the tolls paid by vessels using the
Canal. [About [**5%** of global trade flows through it]{.mark}
annually]{.underline}, and [[the US is]{.mark} its biggest
user---[around **40%** of]{.mark}]{.underline} US container
[[traffic]{.underline}]{.mark} passes through each year.

Meanwhile, [[[China](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/c3vp9rw5rero) is
**catching up**]{.mark} fast]{.underline}. From October 2023 to
September 2024, [China accounted for **21.4%** of]{.underline} the
[cargo]{.underline} volume transiting the Canal---[[making it]{.mark}
the **[second largest]{.mark}** user]{.underline} after the United
States. [[Beijing has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[been **investing** in
Panamanian ports]{.mark}, raising concerns over]{.underline} who has
more [influence]{.underline}.

And the stakes are rising...

[Water
shortages](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/01/09/the-dwindling-of-the-panama-canal-boosts-rival-trade-routes) in
Lake Gatun (one of the lakes that feed the Canal) restrict ship
crossings and raise questions about the Canal's long-term viability, as
does the fact that the century-old locks are not big enough to
accommodate today's largest container ships. All the while, Nicaragua is
reviving dreams of an alternative Canal, backed by Chinese investors.

Trade Is Fragile

It's easy to take global trade for granted---until it breaks. In 2021,
one of the world's largest container ships, the Ever Given, [got
stuck](https://fee.org/articles/that-ship-that-blocked-the-suez-did-what-tariffs-do-every-day/) in
the Suez Canal for six days, freezing \$10 billion in global trade per
day.

The lesson? Apart from countless memes, the Ever Given crisis reminded
the world that maritime chokepoints matter.

Accidents are not the only threat to trade. Recent Houthi rebel attacks
in the Red Sea---where 15% of global trade crosses---have forced
shipping companies away from Suez, rerouting around Africa, adding weeks
to delivery and millions in extra cost---proving just how vulnerable
global trade is.

[[The]{.mark} Panama [Canal's **strategic**
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[fueled
**prosperity**]{.underline}]{.mark} in a country that stands out among
its peers, [proving]{.underline} that [commerce **drives**
progress]{.underline}. But as history shows, when politicians meddle in
trade, they distort it. Washington once controlled the Canal for
geopolitical leverage, and [[now Beijing seeks **influence**]{.mark}
over its ports]{.underline}. But [the]{.underline} real [power behind
the Canal has]{.underline} never been politics---it has [always been
**free trade**]{.underline}.

#### China rise fuels authoritarianism in Latin America

JOW

At the forefront is [[China's]{.mark} desire to [expand]{.mark} its
[sphere of influence]{.mark} through]{.underline} "South-South
cooperation" \[PDF\], a development [framework focused on aid,
investment, and trade. [China's focus]{.mark} on [soft
power]{.mark}]{.underline}---including strengthening cultural and
educational ties---ha[s [help]{.mark}ed [Beijing]{.mark} build
[political goodwill]{.mark} with local governments and [present]{.mark}
itself as a viable [alternative]{.mark} partner [to]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Since former Chinese President Jiang Zemin's landmark thirteen-day tour
of Latin America in 2001, there have been dozens of high-level political
exchanges. President Xi has visited the region at least five times since
he took office in 2013. In return, a record eight presidents from the
region visited China in 2023, versus just one in 2022 and none in 2021
and 2020. In addition to several bilateral agreements with countries in
the region, China has signed comprehensive strategic partnerships
\[PDF\]---its most common type of diplomatic relationship---with
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela.

[[China's]{.mark} push to [isolate Taiwan]{.mark} is another major
factor behind its interest in the region. Because [Beijing]{.mark}
[refuses]{.mark} diplomatic [relations with countries]{.mark} that
[recognize]{.mark} [Taiwan's sovereignty]{.mark}, [Latin
America's]{.mark} [support]{.mark} for the island [has dwindled]{.mark}
in recent years; only Belize, Guatemala, Haiti, and Paraguay still
recognize it,]{.underline} alongside the Caribbean countries of Saint
Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
Honduras was the most recent to switch diplomatic allegiance to Beijing
in 2023 after Taipei denied the country's request for billions of
dollars of aid. [That same year, the [Central]{.mark} [American
Parliament]{.mark} voted to [expel Taiwan]{.mark} as a permanent
observer [and replace]{.mark} it [with China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, some observers say [growing [China-Latin America ties]{.mark}
are [bolster]{.mark}ing [authoritarian]{.mark}
[governments]{.mark},]{.underline} including those in Cuba, Nicaragua,
and Venezuela. China's role in such countries is that of "an incubator
of populism," says Evan Ellis, a research professor of Latin American
Studies at the U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute. "[It's
not that China's trying to produce antidemocratic regimes, but that
antidemocratic [regimes find]{.mark} a willing [partner in]{.mark} the
[Chinese]{.mark}."]{.underline}

#### China's growing influence in Latin America undermines democracy\-\--Beijing backs authoritarian regimes, weakens U.S. leadership, and shifts the region away from the liberal international order.

[**[China's fast growing]{.mark}** economic and trade [ties with]{.mark}
a range of countries in [Latin America and the Caribbean]{.mark} are
increasingly intense and dynamic]{.underline}, as documented elsewhere.1
The pace of that change, and the difficulty of monitoring it, have
raised legitimate questions about what kind of [[influence]{.mark} China
has had on the region's economic and political development]{.underline}.
Based on available data, it seems reasonable to conclude that current
macro levels of Chinese trade and investment in the region have had
[important effects]{.underline} on enabling both good and [[**bad policy
decisions by Latin America**n governments]{.mark},]{.underline} but have
not yet [[translated directly into]{.mark} inordinate leverage on the
region's domestic policies]{.underline}.2

What about China's influence on the [[region's
geopolitics]{.underline}]{.mark}? Beyond its [direct and indirect impact
on the region's economic and governance trajectories, [China]{.mark}'s
economic statecraft also [contains]{.mark} its own **[geopolitical
ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This should come as no surprise. The
[32 states of Latin America and the Caribbean ([LAC]{.mark}) offer a
number of opportunities for [improv]{.mark}ing the general [climate for
**China's "harmonious rise" on the world scene**]{.mark}. The [Chinese
lead]{.mark}ership's overt courting [of the region]{.mark} over the last
several years explicitly [recognizes the value Beijing puts
on]{.mark}]{.underline} close ties of friendship and cooperation
covering not just economic but cultural, [[political and security
domains]{.underline}]{.mark} as well.3 [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
[[aim to **reform the international order to
reflect**]{.underline}]{.mark} the growing economic and financial weight
it and other rising powers carry in the world needs like-minded allies
from the global South to succeed, all the better if joined up by
[[countries **antagonistic to U.S**.]{.mark} global
leadership]{.underline}.

In this respect, Latin America's decade-long swing to the left in the
early 2000s provided fertile ground for advancing this shared goal and
synergistically fed the region's long quest [[for greater strategic
autonomy and cohesion on the world stage, apart from]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. More recent political
trends in the region toward centrist governments,4 combined with the
crisis faced by China's most important partner in the region, Venezuela,
present an important test for what otherwise appears to be a durable
geopolitical marriage of convenience built around traditional concepts
of noninterference in internal affairs and balancing of the West.

The purpose of this paper is to assess whether [[China's growing
economic and trade ties to Latin America and the
Caribbean]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[represent]{.underline}]{.mark}
or may translate into more [[**assertive Chinese geopolitical influence
in the region**,]{.mark} particularly [on]{.mark} issues relevant to the
[**wider international liberal order** championed by]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. Given [China]{.mark}'s [interest
in]{.mark} protecting its system of **[authoritarian
governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} and state capitalism[, [which]{.mark}
run **[counter]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the dominant strain of
[[**liberal democracy** in the region]{.underline}]{.mark}, it would not
be surprising to find that its influence would have the effect of
neutralizing, if not [[turning the LAC]{.mark} region **[against the
international liberal order, to]{.mark}** the **[detriment]{.mark}** of
[U.S. lead]{.mark}ership of the post-World War II system]{.underline}.

#### Engagement with China in Latin America enables digital authoritarianism and elite capture\-\--surveillance tech and economic dependence fracture democracy, marginalize populations, and entrench oppressive regimes loyal to Beijing.

Indeed, [[engagement with]{.mark} the [PRC]{.mark}]{.underline} is
likely to [**[exacerbate]{.mark}** the [gap between]{.mark} the business
and political **[elites who will prosper]{.mark}** by engaging with the
Chinese [and the vast majority for whom]{.mark} economic [opportunities
beyond low-paying]{.mark} extractive sector [work]{.mark}, customer
service, or low-level service and technical jobs, **[are very
limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Chinese systems will **significantly increase**]{.mark} the capacity
of states to register and **[monitor]{.mark}** the financial and other
[activities of their populations]{.mark}]{.underline}. This capacity
[will [enable governments to]{.mark}]{.underline} make progress in
fighting crime but also to **[[repress social
discontent]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Latin American states of course cannot either employ or incarcerate
their entire populations. Latin American states, dependent on economic
engagement with the PRC but equipped with greatly enhanced technical
capabilities to monitor and repress populations (both criminals and
dissenters), may see an evolution in the current divide between "formal"
and "informal" sectors. The [[future could comprise
a]{.underline}]{.mark} politically and economically active
[[sector]{.underline}]{.mark} and another [[registered and tracked by
the state]{.mark} (and [receiving a **minimum of education, healthcare**
and other services]{.mark}).]{.underline} The latter population,
rendered superfluous by largely automated production in support of
Chinese needs, would thus be ignored---[as long as its members do not
present a political or criminal threat to either the state or to the
PRC]{.underline}.

The [[transition]{.underline}]{.mark} between the present and 2050 [[is
likely to see a shift from]{.underline}]{.mark} the prevailing vision of
the PRC as a de facto political and developmental alternative to [the
United States and [Western-style democracy to]{.mark} that of a
grudgingly accepted [**oppressor** that generates great personal
wealth]{.mark} and opportunity for a small number of well-connected
local elites [but]{.mark} whose influence the highly [monitor]{.mark}ed
[residents of Latin American and Caribbean]{.mark}]{.underline} R. Evan
Ellis \| 29 states do not dare to openly oppose. Ironically, [in that
transition, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [may]{.mark}, for many
in the region, [go from]{.mark} being seen as an imperialist
**[hegemon]{.mark}** imposing its will on the region [to]{.mark} a
romanticized symbol of **[subverted]{.mark}** ideals of
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and personal liberty.

[[During]{.mark} the [transition period]{.mark}]{.underline} to 2050,
[[Latin American and Caribbean populations are likely
to]{.underline}]{.mark} become increasingly uneasy with PRC economic and
political influence in the region, including local elites who may be
perceived as being compromised by their personal interests and other
pressures to serve Chinese objectives. Such discomfort will likely give
rise to political and social movements [[rally]{.mark}ing
[against]{.mark} the developmental model adopted by [governments]{.mark}
in the region [with]{.mark} the pressure or [encouragement of]{.mark}
the [Chinese]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Such movements may temporarily bring to power governments [[that
embrace]{.underline}]{.mark} varying alternative ideologies, from
nationalistic autonomous development to a return to economic models and
politics aligned with the United States and the West. It is not clear,
however, that the United States, struggling with ballooning public debt
(compounded in 2050 by less latitude to secure buyers for its bonds when
the dollar is less dominant), will be able to direct sufficient
resources to make their gestures economically beneficial or politically
sustainable.

For its part, the **[[PRC]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely will use
bilateral and multilateral diplomacy [to strengthen its [grip and
advance]{.mark} its interests [in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
its bilateral relationships, [[China]{.mark} probably [will
**expand**]{.mark}]{.underline} the number of its strategic partnerships
in the region84 and the government to-government coordination within
them on [political, **[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and economic
issues. The PRC, for example, is likely to use the ministerial-level
coordinating committees typically associated with such partnerships

#### Democratic backsliding kills economic growth.

Corporate Governance, "The Financial and Economic Dangers of Democratic
Backsliding,"
https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/07/31/the-financial-and-economic-dangers-of-democratic-backsliding/\]

The [[last decade]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[witnessed]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**erosion**
of]{.mark} [[democratic **institutions**]{.mark} and
**practices**](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb2434) in a
wide range of countries]{.underline}, including established democracies,
newer democracies, and countries thought to be on the path from
autocracy to democracy. In its 2023 report, the V-Dem Institute [details
this
trend](https://v-dem.net/documents/30/V-dem_democracyreport2023_highres.pdf),
noting that, [[for]{.mark} the [first]{.mark} time [in]{.mark} more than
**[twenty years]{.mark}**, there are [more]{.mark} closed
[**autocracies** than]{.mark} liberal
**[democracies]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the world. This shift includes
increased government repression of civil society organizations,
deteriorations in election quality, and increased government censorship
of media.

Although the features of political institutions in the United States
have not changed substantially in recent years, some political actors
have grown more willing to use these institutions to undermine
democratic practices. In the November 2022 elections in the United
States, election-denying candidates had modest success in statewide
races for governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. The
decentralized nature of U.S. election administration, however, means
that the actions of even a single state-level official could wreak
significant havoc on national electoral processes.

The high-profile losses in statewide races also conceal more ominous
signs at other levels. Counting statewide elected officials, candidates
for the House and Senate, and state legislative candidates, 226
election-denying [candidates
prevailed](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/11/15/democracy-on-the-ballot-hobbs-finishes-off-election-denial-for-now/),
or about 66 percent. Across [17
states](https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/replacingtherefs/),
23 election-denying officials now hold positions that oversee voting and
electoral administration. Indeed, U.S. states can serve as laboratories
not necessarily for improved public policies and democratic practices,
but also for the [erosion of democratic
institutions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/laboratories-of-democratic-backsliding/0742F08306EFDD8612539F089853E4FE?utm_source=SFMC&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Article&utm_campaign=New%20Cambridge%20Alert%20-%20Issues%20Society&WT.mc_id=New%20Cambridge%20Alert%20-%20Issues%20Society).
Moreover, many members of the majority party in the U.S. House of
Representatives are election deniers. The erosion of democratic
practices and norms therefore remains a serious threat in the United
States, especially as the 2024 elections approach.

[Such an [**erosion** is]{.mark} a [threat]{.mark} not only [to]{.mark}
our country's [**political** well-being]{.mark}, but [also]{.mark} to
**[economic]{.mark}** and financial [outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In
a
report](https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/financial-and-economic-dangers-backsliding/) recently
­­­released by the Governance Program at the Brookings Institution and the
States United Democracy Center, I detail the [potential [**risks**
to]{.mark} institutional [**investors** of democratic
backsliding]{.mark} in the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Given such threats, [institutional investors
may have a **fiduciary** responsibility to take actions -- ranging from
undertaking **[analyses]{.mark}** more [attentive to political risk to
**reconsidering** investment holdings]{.mark} in certain states and
firms]{.underline}.

[My
report](https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/financial-and-economic-dangers-backsliding/) draws
on a range of social scientific studies which examine the various
[**links** between]{.underline} the [nature of political
institutions]{.underline}, on the one hand, [and **economic** and
financial outcomes]{.underline}. These analyses [employ
[**quantitative** data]{.mark}]{.underline} from larger samples of
wealthy as well as low- and middle-income countries,
[[examin]{.mark}ing]{.underline} (for instance) the [**[higher
costs]{.mark}** of capital]{.underline} for [[in
**non-democratic**]{.mark} political [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Because of the size and unique position of the United States in the
global economy, such analyses often exclude the United States from their
datasets.  This choice usually makes sense from the point of view of
statistical analyses; but we should expect the dynamics relating
political risk to economic outcomes to be similar in the United States.
Indeed, [[investors]{.mark} in the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates may [stand to [lose]{.mark} more [from]{.mark}
democratic **[backsliding]{.mark}**]{.underline} than their counterparts
in other countries (see below). [While most large investors]{.underline}
have thus far **[assumed]{.underline}** that [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is]{.underline}
somehow [exceptional -- insulating financial markets from the **risk**
of democratic backsliding -- this may well prove
**incorrect**]{.underline}.

What do we know about how the weakening of political institutions
affects economic outcomes? It is worth noting that the [material effects
of **[deteriorations]{.mark}** in governance [are far from limited
to]{.mark}]{.underline} countries experiencing [[**coups** and **civil
conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather, they can matter in more subtle
ways. In the report, I discuss three such channels. First, [[**weak**
rule of law]{.underline}]{.mark} -- that is, a de facto lack of respect,
often on the part of government officials, for de jure protections --
[**[undermines]{.mark}** longer-term [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Around the world, investors prefer political systems in which the rule
of law is respected. When rule of law is weaker, firms worry more about
the security of their investments. Investment also is lower, all else
equal, when governments are less transparent in their provision of
information --- another hallmark of non-democratic political systems.

Certainly, multinational firms do invest in countries with weak
political institutions, because they sometimes find other features of
those economies sufficiently attract. But, when doing so, they tend to
make investments that are more easily reversible. In other instances,
they hope that investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms will address
their concerns -- although such mechanisms also depend on the
willingness of governments to respect legal processes.

Second, [[political uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[**disrupts** asset markets]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as those for
equities, currencies and bonds. [Elections and [government
**turnover**]{.mark} often [are sources of market
**uncertainty**]{.mark} and **volatility**]{.underline}. When investors
worry about whether an election will generate a radical shift in
government policies, or about whether election results will be
respected, decreases in stock market valuations, [**higher** interest
rate premiums and **currency crises** can follow]{.underline}.
Furthermore, the more democratic a country's national political
institutions are, the better able governments are to[ access sovereign
credit](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/contingent-advantage-sovereign-borrowing-democratic-institutions-and-global-capital-cycles/68551C8C8B7FDFC3D0FE72C43AE9EEFC) markets.
The positive effect of democratic political institutions on access to
credit is especially pronounced when global financial conditions are
tighter, as they have been recently.

Third, the [[political actors who]{.mark} seek to [**undermine**
democratic practices]{.mark} often [have]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[**populist** orientation]{.mark}. Populist]{.underline} political
[actors espouse **anti-elite** as well as]{.underline} strongly
[**nationalist** views, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} they tend to
**[[oppose]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and often actively seek to undermine)
[**international institutions** as well as [economic
**globalization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, the electoral [success
of]{.underline} such [candidates would **erode** many]{.underline} of
the [gains]{.underline} that many firms, consumers and investors have
[experienced]{.underline} in the [post-World War II]{.underline} era.
While the multilateral institutions on which the post-World War II
liberal international order was based (such as the World Trade
Organization) may need reform, a broader [[**abandonment**
multilateralism]{.mark} and economic **integration** [would be very
**harmful** to]{.mark}]{.underline} many parts of [[the]{.mark} U.S.
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [due to its **critical role in

stated. 

The Panama [[Canal is **massively important for supply chains**]{.mark},
with [6% of global maritime trade]{.mark} passing through its

Approximately [[40% of U.S. container traffic utilizes the canal]{.mark}

Initially opened in 1914 following a monumental construction effort led
by the United States, the canal was handed over to Panamanian control in
1999 under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. These treaties, negotiated
during the Carter administration, have been a longstanding point of
contention among some U.S. politicians who see the transfer as a
strategic error.

### 2ac -- Trump

#### Trump staying the course increases Chinese influence.

**Illueca '25** \[Alonso E.; 1/28/25; LLM in International and
Comparative Law from Columbia University, Research Associate Professor
at [Universidad Católica Santa María La
Antigua](https://www.linkedin.com/company/397692/); The Diplomat,
"Trump's Panama Gambit and the China Paradox,"
https://thediplomat.com/2025/01/trumps-panama-gambit-and-the-china-paradox/\]

For the past month, both before and after taking the oath of office on
January 20,  U.S. President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[repeatedly **[threatened]{.mark}** the [territorial **integrity** of
Panama]{.mark}]{.underline}. More recently, during his inaugural
address, [he openly **pledged** to take back the Panama
Canal]{.underline}. In doing so, [he]{.underline} has [[**falsely**
claimed]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[China "operates" the canal]{.mark}
and]{.underline} that [Panama is]{.underline}, therefore, [in **breach**
of the]{.underline} canal's [neutrality regime]{.underline}. 

Such [[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly
[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} the [dawn of a **[new era]{.mark}** in
international politics, **[devolving]{.mark}** inter-state [relations
to]{.mark} a **["might makes right"]{.mark}** age]{.underline}. In such
a scenario, [Panama could face the same fate as the **Melians** at the
hands of the **Athenians**]{.underline}, as summed up in ancient Greek
historian Thucydides' famous axiom, [with the strong]{.underline} (the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates) [doing what they can
and the weak (Panama) **suffering** what they must]{.underline}. 

Nonetheless, [Trump's bet is to not have to pursue **military**
conquest]{.underline} in the Athenian way. [He would rather have a
**complacent** Panama, accepting all U.S. demands]{.underline}. As shown
by the recent Colombia-U.S. [clash over
deportations](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p36e62gyo), [Trump's
approach seems to be **"cooperate or else."**]{.underline}

In the case of Panama, besides the claim of taking back the canal, it
could be argued that [[Trump]{.mark} is seeking to
**expel**]{.underline} any and all [Chinese influence from the country.
He seems to be [demanding **full submission**]{.mark} from
Panama]{.underline} by expelling the likes of CK Hutchison Holdings,
China Communications Construction Company, China Harbor Engineering
Company, Landbridge Group, and even Huawei from its jurisdiction. In the
U.S. Congress, some lawmakers have even suggested requiring Panama to
break diplomatic ties with Beijing and to reestablish them with Taipei.
[Such a **gambit** apparently seeks [to]{.mark} completely [**root out**
China's influence]{.mark} in Panama. However, this [may achieve]{.mark}
the **[opposite]{.mark}** of what is intended]{.underline}. 

The [[current]{.mark} U.S. [policy]{.mark} toward China's influence in
Panama [is **fundamentally flawed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [it is
[**alienating** Panama]{.mark}]{.underline}, a treaty ally and a
partner, [which since receiving the canal has **willingly**
cooperated]{.underline} with the United States in most of its
international undertakings, including as part of the Coalition of the
Willing in the 2003 Iraq War, the Proliferation Security Initiative of
the same year and the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS established in
2014. Panama has even granted the U.S. permission to patrol Panamanian
sovereign waters. 

Second, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates has apparently [**[decoupled]{.mark}**
its [policy vis-à-vis Panama]{.mark} from]{.underline} the [defense of
common values and principles]{.underline}, particularly [[regarding
**democracy**, **transparency** and **human
rights**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 

Third, [[Trump]{.mark}'s approach **[ignores]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
[[efforts]{.mark} jointly undertaken by the U.S.]{.underline} (during
the Biden administration) [and Panama [to **counter** China's influence
by]{.mark}]{.underline} inter alia [[**halting** free trade]{.mark}
agreement talks]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [projects in
Margarita Island]{.underline} (currently in arbitration) and Pilón Port,
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} have [significantly **[reduced]{.mark}**
China's [influence]{.mark} around the canal]{.underline}. 

Fourth and last, [by [focusing **exclusively** on]{.mark} the
[**economic** and]{.mark} potential [**military** components]{.mark} of
China's presence in Panama]{.underline}, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [[is **ignoring**]{.mark} other [realms where]{.mark}
China's [influence is]{.mark} more [**significant**. Here is]{.mark} the
[**paradox** tied to Trump]{.mark}'s gambit [as]{.mark}]{.underline} his
upcoming [[moves against Panama]{.mark} may]{.underline} well [[end up
increasing China's influence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the country. 

The [2024 China Index](https://china-index.io/), which measures China's
influence in 98 jurisdictions,
ranks [Panama](https://china-index.io/country/Panama) 12th globally and
second regionally (Latin America), which means that it is among the
countries where Beijing exerts a relatively high level of influence.
When analyzed, however, the data compiled demonstrates that it is in
Panama's economic and military domains where China exerts less influence
and seems fairly contained. In fact, China's influence in Panama is more
significant in the fields of media (59.1 percent), academia (47.7
percent), society (68.2 percent), law enforcement (50 percent),
technology (40 percent), domestic politics (82.5 percent), and foreign
policy (68.2 percent), which sharply contrast with China's limited
influence in Panama's economy (27.3 percent) and military (30 percent). 

[By focusing on]{.underline} the [[**immediate**
returns]{.underline}]{.mark} -- i.e. forcing Panama to expel CK
Hutchison Holdings and others -- [Trump is implementing]{.underline} a
[[policy]{.mark} based [on economic coercion]{.mark} **against** an ally
without]{.underline} taking due regard for the facts [regarding China's
influence]{.underline} in the country. [In the short term this may
[**align** Panama]{.mark} even [further with China]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the realms of [**domestic** politics and **foreign**
policy, which in the medium and long terms could be [accompanied
by]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[**consolidation** of]{.mark} China's
[influence]{.mark} in the country [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the realms of
[[**media**, **society**, **academia**, and **law
enforcement**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 

Since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 2017, it is undeniable
that China has exponentially increased its influence in Panama. This is
in large measure due to the United States' incremental passivity in its
bilateral relations with Panama. For example, during almost five of
these seven-plus years of China-Panama bilateral relations the United
States did not have an ambassador in Panama, while China had two
different ambassadors uninterruptedly advancing its agenda. 

In order to counter China's influence in Panama, the United States needs
a comprehensive and values-oriented approach. It is precisely through
the support of democracy, transparency, and human rights that
substantive improvements can be introduced, and foreign interference be
prevented. [If the [current trend]{.mark} **continues** it would further
**[empower]{.mark}**]{.underline} autocrats like China's
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin. In the
end, [it is very likely that **[economic coercion]{.mark}** or
even]{.underline} the [threat of it would **force** Panama to
"cooperate" -- but]{.underline} make no mistake, [such a policy based on
**threats**, **devoid** of principles and values, which **ignores**
past-joint efforts and **lacks** a comprehensive and factual approach,
may well [end up having]{.mark} the [**paradoxical** effect of
**increasing** China's influence]{.mark} in Panama]{.underline}. 

### 2ac -- alt pathways

#### Alternate routes to Panama inevitable -- climate change and infrastructure concerns limit shipping traffic

**Hogan '25** \[Dennis M.; 1/1/25; Professor in the History and
Literature program at Harvard; The New York Times, "The Panama Canal Has
a Big Problem, but It's Not China or Trump,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/opinion/panama-canal-trump-china-drought.html\]

In 2023, on a research trip to Panama, I booked a day tour of the Panama
Canal. I expected to hear the usual story about the canal's epic
construction, importance in world trade and successful expansion to
allow for larger modern ships. What I did not expect was the
[**[overwhelming]{.mark}** sense of **concern**, even
**[panic]{.mark}**, among people who depend on the canal]{.underline}
for their livelihoods.

It was July, the middle of Panama's rainy season. But the rains had been
sparse, and [[water levels]{.mark} in the canal]{.underline} had
[[sunk]{.mark} to **troubling lows**]{.underline}. Without freshwater
from rain, our guide explained, the locks on the canal could not
operate.

I remembered that visit after President-elect Donald [[Trump
said]{.underline}]{.mark} recently that [the [Chinese were
**threatening**]{.mark} America's interests]{.underline} at the canal,
[and]{.underline} he [engaged in some saber rattling]{.underline} by
[suggesting]{.underline} that [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could take back **control** of the
passage]{.underline}, which was returned to Panama exactly 25 years ago
Tuesday. The handover treaties were a signature achievement of President
Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday; Mr. Trump's comments were in keeping
with longstanding criticism that the move was a strategic mistake.

But Mr. [[Trump misunderstands]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**true
threat** to]{.mark} U.S. commerce through [Panama]{.mark}. If the goal
is securing affordable access]{.underline} to the transit point over the
[long term, [it is **climate change**, not Chinese
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, that [U.S. [policymakers should
**worry** about]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Here's why. [Sending [a single ship]{.mark} through]{.underline} the
canal's locks [can [use]{.mark} around [**50 million** gallons of
water]{.mark}]{.underline}, mainly freshwater collected from Lake Gatún.
[Though the canal is, for the moment, operating at **full** capacity, a
[**drier** climate and]{.mark} greater [**demand** for]{.mark} drinking
[water]{.mark} have]{.underline} in recent years [reduced]{.underline}
the [**volume** of available water. That]{.underline}
has [[[forced]{.underline}]{.mark} the state-run
[[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark} Canal
Authority](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html) at
times [[to **limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [number of daily
[passages]{.mark}]{.underline} through the canal, at one point
[[by]{.mark} as much as **[40 percent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[With **less rain**]{.underline}, the [reservoirs fill up more
**slowly**, which means less water available]{.underline} to operate the
locks, [which means **fewer ships**]{.underline} can [pass]{.underline}.
Hence, the 2023-24 [[drought]{.underline}]{.mark}, among the worst on
record, [[**slowed** transits]{.mark} and [drove up]{.mark} transit
[**prices**, causing long **delays**]{.mark}, [more **expensive**
consumer
goods](https://unctad.org/publication/review-maritime-transport-2024) [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
greater [**[instability]{.mark}** in shipping routes]{.underline}. These
were probably the increases Mr. Trump referred to as a "rip-off."

The [limited]{.underline} number of [passages]{.underline} has [led
to [**auctions**](https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1151913/Trump-to-Panama-Reduce-ridiculous-tolls-or-US-will-take-back-canal#:~:text=Panama%20suffered%20a%20historic%20drought,year%2C%20which%20ended%20in%20September.) for
passage rights that]{.underline} further **[inflated]{.underline}** the
[growing cost of shipping]{.underline} goods [through the
canal]{.underline}. (The canal authority [increased
tolls](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/business/panama-canal-water-revenue.html) just
before the 2023 drought began.) In the short term, [reduced access
causes goods to take **longer**]{.underline} to reach their
destinations, [and]{.underline} they [**cost** more]{.underline} when
they arrive. Over the medium term, [[companies]{.mark} have **begun** to
[seek [**alternate**
routes](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/01/09/the-dwindling-of-the-panama-canal-boosts-rival-trade-routes)]{.mark}]{.underline} and
different methods [of moving goods]{.underline}. Some [projects,
[like]{.mark} a [**[railway]{.mark}**
corridor](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/breaking-ground/mexico-is-building-a-75-billion-trade-route-to-compete-with-panama-canal/B9342697-6F40-43EE-84A3-945F6EF914E0) [across
**southern Mexico**]{.mark}]{.underline}, have [emerged [to **directly
compete**]{.mark} with the]{.underline} Panama [Canal]{.underline}. Over
the long term, [as trade **volume** and [ship **sizes**
increase](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/business/economy/container-ships-suez-canal.html) while]{.underline}
the amount of available [water decreases, [the canal
could]{.mark}]{.underline} well [**[lose]{.mark}** market [share,

The 2023-24 drought was due in part to a [strong El Niño
effect](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/el-nino-weakens-impacts-continue),
as rising surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean altered weather
patterns worldwide. Scientists generally agree that climate change is
making El Niño events [more
frequent](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/el-nino-climate-change) and [more
severe](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/saving-the-panama-canal-will-take-years-and-cost-billions-if-its-even-possible/#:~:text=World-,Saving%20the%20Panama%20Canal%20will%20take%20years,billions%2C%20if%20it's%20even%20possible&text=The%20vestiges%20of%20an%20ancient,stumps%20rise%20above%20the%20waterline.).
Higher temperatures have [increased the
evaporation](https://www.wired.com/story/panama-canal-climate-change/) of
water off the reservoir, too, further reducing the water supply.

Mr. [Trump's **insinuations** about Chinese influence]{.underline}, his
demands for lower transit fees and his talk of returning the canal to
U.S. control have, of course, [not won him **admiration** in
Panama]{.underline}, least of all among civic leaders more concerned
with solving the canal's challenges.

In recent days, President José Raúl Mulino of Panama has repeatedly
rejected accusations of Chinese influence.
He [declared](https://x.com/France24_en/status/1872696809811808635) at a
news conference last week that "the Panama Canal is Panamanian and
belongs to Panamanians" and that Panamanian control of the waterway had
cost the country "blood, sweat and tears." There is [no legal
mechanism](https://apnews.com/article/trump-panama-canal-roosevelt-treaties-1999-handover-8db28fd0249377a3f102cbb0a81e9356) by
which Mr. Trump might demand its return.

Panamanians are rightly proud of their administration of the canal over
the past 25 years; in suggesting that the United States retains any
claim to it, Mr. Trump risks alienating a country that [remains
friendly](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-panama/) to the
United States despite a long history of U.S. arrogance toward the
Panamanian people.

Panama has been a global crossroads since the 19th century. A sea route
across the isthmus was [first
imagined](https://pancanal.com/en/early-plans/) by the Spanish in the
16th century; the overland route between the oceans rose to prominence
in the 1840s and 1850s during the [California Gold
Rush](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/255/monograph/book/68253%5C). Through the
19th century, the United States competed against other imperial powers,
mainly Britain and France, for land and influence in Central America.
Controlling Panama was a [key
feature](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/panama-canal-helped-make-u-s-world-power) of
the American rise to hemispheric dominance and overseas empire in the
wake of the Spanish-American War of 1898.

Panamanians have benefited from that competition, but they have equally
been victimized by it: Panama became independent in 1903,
but [sovereignty came at the
cost](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/panama-canal) of
ceding the Canal Zone to the United States. Both before and after the
construction of the canal, U.S. military intervention was a constant
threat. Since the 1840s, the United States has [intervened
frequently](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/united-states-interventions/) to
protect its commercial interests in Panama. U.S. troops deployed to
Panama 13 times from 1856 to 1903. Most seriously, [an invasion in
1989](https://apnews.com/article/62c740ff27059d3b1579f71a1348f018) resulted
in the deaths of hundreds of Panamanian civilians; unofficial estimates
put the number in the thousands.

The history of U.S.-Panama relations is neither simple nor
straightforward. The United States built the canal, and without support
from the U.S. military, Panama probably would not have been able to
secede from Colombia and establish itself as an independent nation. The
United States has served as an occupier but also a major trading
partner, ally and source of cultural influence.

Many Americans have [Panamanian
roots](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/fact-sheet/us-hispanics-facts-on-panamanian-origin-latinos/#:~:text=Panamanians%20are%20the%2015th%2Dlargest,growing%20from%20100%2C000%20to%20240%2C000.),
and an increasing number of [Americans
live](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenpeddicord/2024/11/22/guide-to-retiring-in-panama/) in
Panama. Now migrants from places such as Haiti and Venezuela [are
crossing](https://www.cfr.org/article/crossing-darien-gap-migrants-risk-death-journey-us) the
Daríén Gap straddling Colombia and Panama en route to the United States,
prompting a fresh humanitarian emergency and new challenges for both
Panama and the United States. These are nations whose fates are tied
together.

From Panama to Greenland, Mr. Trump's expansionist ambitions point to a
larger truth: In a world increasingly dependent on extended supply
chains that crisscross the globe, mastery of logistics translates to
economic security. Taking Panama (as Teddy Roosevelt did), Mr. Trump
imagines, might secure U.S. access to the canal, and buying Greenland
(as he has also suggested) would guarantee a [U.S.
presence](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/opinion/greenland-trump-real-estate.html) at
the entrance to a future northwest passage through the melting Arctic
ice. In Mr. Trump's view of international competition, it seems sea
routes are to be seized, controlled and monopolized, not shared among
nations with equal access to all, [as the Panama Canal
is](https://pancanal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/neutrality-treaty.pdf).

[Costs of **transiting** the canal are going up]{.underline}. But
[[neither]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[Panamanian greed nor Chinese
influence **determines**]{.mark} these [costs. The truth
is]{.mark}]{.underline} more **[[straightforward]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
if more daunting: [[If we want]{.mark} to ensure fair, equal and
[**sustainable** access]{.mark} to the canal, [it is **climate change**

#### Climate change ensures alternate shipping lanes

[[Climate]{.mark} change is]{.underline} increasingly
[[disrupting]{.mark} [global]{.mark} trade, [impacting]{.mark}

flows [and]{.mark} [shipping]{.mark} routes,]{.underline} requiring the

#### New Arctic shipping routes threaten the Panama Canal

Adrian **Piecyk**, 20**21**. The Arctic Institute. [A Bridge Across Two
Oceans: The Arctic Challenge to Panama Canal Shipping \| The Arctic
Institute -- Center for Circumpolar Security
Studies](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/bridge-across-two-oceans-arctic-challenge-panama-canal-shipping/)

If Given a pair of darts and a map, you would be hard-pressed to hit two
spots more visibly different than Panama and the Arctic Ocean[. These
two places, disparate though they may be, are being brought together by
the [global threat of climate change]{.mark}. The [disappearance
of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean's summer [ice]{.mark} over the
course of the next century could also [herald]{.mark} the [disappearance
of]{.mark} Panama's greatest economic engine -- the [Panama
Canal]{.mark} -- [as shipping]{.mark} is instead [redirected through
shorter]{.mark} Arctic [routes]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scale of this
threat prompts three questions: what advantages does Arctic shipping
provide over the Panama Canal, how is Panama confronting the issue, and
how realistic is the prospect of greater volumes of Arctic shipping? To
answer these questions, this article will first contrast the merits and
importance of both Arctic and Panama Canal shipping, followed by an
examination of Panamanian news articles and government statements, and
then conclude with a feasibility analysis and future projections. The
picture which emerges is a mixed one: Panama's media tends to focus on
more immediate threats than melting Arctic ice, and while the expansion
of Arctic shipping itself seems inevitable, it remains to be seen how
quickly and how practically it could overshadow the Canal.

The Lifeline of Panama

From as early as 12,000 BC, the Indigenous ancestors of the modern
Ngöbe, Kuna, and Buglere peoples inhabited the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts of the thin isthmus that later became Panama.^1)^ This gap
between the world's two largest oceans was only bridged in 1914, with
the completion of the Panama Canal. Since assuming control of the Canal
under the auspices of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) in 1999, it has
formed the cornerstone of Panama's economic and diplomatic efforts. The
Canal and its associated services encompass approximately 40% of
Panama's economy,^2)^ and as of writing, revenues from the Canal have
essentially increased five-fold since 1999. Official figures for 2019
set a new record, with tariffs on 468,779,276 PC/UMS^3)^ net tons
generating \$2.592 billion USD, despite a dip in total transits from the
preceding year.^4)^ Growth has been brisk since the completion of a
long-awaited modernization in 2016, an achievement touted by the ACP as
"re-inaugurating" the Canal's role as a global trade hub. The
modernization project, which focused on the expansion of the Canal
locks, has already achieved demonstrable success thanks to the expanded
locks now accommodating up to 90% of the world's crude oil and natural
gas tankers.^5)^ With rising revenues and new technical feats, how could
the melting of polar ice drastically affect even a modernized Panama
Canal?

The Arctic Passages

The Panama Canal's success depends on its convenience -- shorter
distances equal lower shipping costs. The Canal revolutionized
international trade upon its opening, as it allowed vessels to sail
directly between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. [What happens, then,
when an even [more convenient route opens]{.mark}, and seemingly [with
no upfront cost]{.mark}? Just as the Panama Canal earns record revenues
year-after-year, so too is the Arctic Ocean seeing record rates of
melting ice]{.underline}. As of August 2020, the Arctic Ocean maintains
approximately 5.08 million km^2 ^of thinner, late summer ice coverage,
but it has lost 3.15 million km^2 ^of late summer ice since 1979, at a
rate of close to 76,800km^2^ per year.^6)^ [[The Northwest
Passage]{.mark}, a sea route which winds its way along Canada's Arctic
coast and provides the shortest route to the east coast of North America
from East Asia, could be [ice-free and navigable in summer]{.mark}
within a matter of decades]{.underline}. Its sister, the Northeast
Passage, chiefly follows the northern Russian coast, and so provides an
alternative to shipping through the Suez. Between these two lies the
more difficult but direct Transpolar Route, which could circumvent many
of the Northwest Passage's navigational, depth, and territorial issues
were its summer ice to disappear, as could happen by 2050, according to
scientific predictions.^7)^ The extent of thick, multi-year ice is down
60 percent from 1980, and its replacement by thinner, seasonal ice could
preclude the need for ice breakers for Arctic shipping.^8)^ A shorter,
toll-free transit route through the Arctic means not only less cost for
freight, but also reduced carbon emissions, and these factors could
seriously affect the decision-making of Panama's key transit partners.

Arctic Voyages -- Fluke or Trend?

Over the past decade, several high-profile transits through the
Northwest Passage specifically have highlighted the danger of this
alternate route to the Panama Canal's dominance. Travelling from
Vancouver to Finland in 2013, the carrier *Nordic Orion *saved \$200,000
and four days of sailing by taking the Northwest Passage instead of the
Panama Canal.^9)^ More recently, the Finnish icebreaker *Nordica *set a
record in 2017 by travelling 10,000 km in a mere 24 days by a similar
route.^10)^ Though these transits by individual ships have a limited
impact on a broader scale, they nevertheless set a precedent which could
herald far greater volumes of traffic through the Arctic in the near
future.

A Looming Economic Disaster

Considering that the [[Northwest Passage]{.mark} would [best facilitate
shipping between]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} East Coast [and]{.mark}
[Asia]{.mark}, the [picture]{.mark} becomes even [grimmer for
Panama]{.mark}]{.underline}. As of 2019, official stats record that a
staggering 39 percent of total tonnage passing through the Panama Canal
travels along the East Coast-Asia route, translating to 180,564,000
PC/UMS net tons out of 468,779,000 total.^11)^ The next largest route by
cargo throughput, between the US East Coast and the west coast of South
America, comes out to 38,640,000 PC/UMS, or a mere 8 percent of total
tonnage. The United States alone accounts for no less than 66.4 percent
of Canal traffic by origin and destination, followed perhaps
unsurprisingly by China at 13.6 percent.^12)^ On a global scale, the
[Panama Canal facilitates approximately 5 percent of total oceanic
shipping, an impressive figure,]{.underline} but one which is
overwhelmingly dependent on the flow of trade between the US and China.

[Given the inexorable march of climate change and unprecedented ice melt
in the North, the **question** facing the Panama Canal in terms of
future traffic loss is less "if" and **more "how much**."]{.underline}
The East Coast -- Asia route is indisputably the cornerstone of Panama
Canal traffic, and if [the US and China leap at the opportunity for up
to [30 percent shorter journeys compared to]{.mark} taking [the
Canal]{.mark}]{.underline},^13)^ the losses in revenue for Panama could
be staggering. Using the 2019 figures as a baseline, a conservative loss
of 25 percent along the East Coast -- Asia route alone would see PC/UMS
tonnage drop by 45,141,000, or more than 7,000,000 PC/UMS than the next
leading route has total. A far worse [scenario with 75 percent losses
would see a staggering drop of 135,423,000 PC/UMS, a whopping 29 percent
of total tonnage]{.underline}.

Tariffs would likewise have to be adjusted to maintain competitiveness
with Arctic alternatives. Though the fees levied depend on a wide range
of circumstances, the largest container ships of 10,000 TEU (twenty-foot
equivalent containers) and over could expect to pay upwards of
\$1,000,000 USD, while older Panamax vessels average to around
\$500,000.^14)^ As such, [Panama would not only be receiving
substantially less shipping through the Canal, but even the shipping it
receives would be paying less. Given the potential scale of the threat
facing Panama if Arctic ice continues to melt at present rates, one
would imagine that it would be front-and-centre in national
discourse.]{.underline}

These [[canal]{.mark} chokepoints]{.underline}, however, [are
increasingly **[fraught]{.mark}** [with
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. The Suez Canal, for instance,
witnessed a major disruption in March 2021 when the Ever Given container
ship became lodged, blocking the canal for six days and causing global
trade delays that cost the shipping industry approximately \$400 million
per hour in terms of cargo value (Vlamis, 2021). More recently, in 2024,
transit has again been disrupted due to regional hostilities that are
directly impacting this trade route ("How Viable is Arctic Shipping?",
2024). Though not plagued by violence and unrest, [the [Panama]{.mark}

**[36%]{.mark}** [due to]{.mark} its own issues derived from [climate

#### Trump outweighs -- threats cause China pivot

the University of Arizona; Baker Institute, "Adverse Consequences of US
Threats to Retake the Panama Canal,"
https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal\]

Introduction

President Donald Trump's comments threatening to resume United States
control of the Panama Canal, reiterated in his inaugural address on Jan.
20, could have significant political consequences for U.S. influence in
the
region. [\[1\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn1) 

The dangers go well beyond assertions that Panama is charging
unreasonable tolls for ships transiting the Canal, even though there
appears to be a valid basis for Trump's assertions that rates are
excessive, as discussed more fully
below. [\[2\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn2) Similarly,
Hong Kong/Chinese port management companies that have been operating in
Panama for almost 30 years are not currently a threat to the neutrality
of the canal, although an increased Chinese presence could be considered
a risk in the future. The Trump administration's concerns also reflect
the fact that some 70% of canal traffic consists of shipments to or from
the United States as well as an awareness of significant Chinese
influence in the areas near the canal.

This threat, like the reiteration of Trump's desire to take over
Greenland, seems to be anything but a joke, designed in significant part
to make clear that "decades of U.S. commerce financing China's growth
and strategic footprint in the Americas is over," according to a senior
Trump
official. [\[3\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn3)

Whether a canal takeover or other form of intervention is ultimately
carried out or not, Trump\'s aggressive "America First" philosophy is
reminding countries across the Western Hemisphere of past U.S. military
incursions in Latin America and the Caribbean, including a brief
invasion of Panama in 1989 to overthrow notorious military dictator and
drug lord Manuel
Noriega. [\[4\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn4) Still,
regardless of what some might consider a desirable response to China's
growing presence in Central and South America, [[if the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[takes unilateral steps **against** Panama]{.mark}, the [results
are]{.mark} likely to be the [**opposite** of what Trump
intends]{.mark}. Such [actions could **backfire**, giving China]{.mark}
new [opportunities to]{.mark} win friends and [**influence**
governments]{.mark}]{.underline} in South America and
elsewhere. [\[5\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn5)

[[China's]{.mark} recent [efforts to **displace**]{.mark} U.S.
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region --- including the new
China-financed Peruvian Chancay container port, which could reshape
China's trade with Latin America --- [have [received]{.mark} a [boost
from Trump's]{.mark} recent **[threats]{.mark}** to retake the
canal]{.underline}, possibly through military
force. [\[6\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn6) As
of October 2022, China was already the largest trading partner with most
[[South America]{.mark}n nations]{.underline} although, at that time,
the U.S. remained the largest overall trading partner for the
hemisphere. [\[7\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn7) Nations
such as Peru, with its new container port, and Brazil, with current
construction of Chinese auto manufacturing facilities, are already
moving closer to China and, by implication, further from such
U.S.-friendly nations as Colombia. Colombia, Panama's southern neighbor
--- expected to join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2025 and
considering membership in the BRICs bank --- [may [view]{.mark} Trump's
[threat]{.mark} against Panama [as]{.mark} further [**justification**
for **distancing**]{.mark}]{.underline} itself [[from the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. [\[8\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn8) Ultimately,
[[**anti-U.S.** gov]{.mark}ernment[s]{.mark} in Central and South
America]{.underline}, as well as the Caribbean --- including Nicaragua,
Venezuela, Bolivia, and Cuba --- may [[argue]{.mark} that U.S.
[**interventionist** risks]{.mark} in Latin America [remain]{.mark}
present, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**strengthening** ties with
China]{.underline}]{.mark} or Russia [[could be]{.mark} a [more]{.mark}
**stable** alternative]{.underline}.

The potential negative consequences for the United States are not
difficult to envision. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino's immediate
reaction to this threat to his country's sovereignty --- coming from one
of the strongest U.S. allies in the hemisphere --- was to denounce it in
the strongest terms. At a minimum, pursuing the threat could risk
Molino's promised cooperation in closing the Darien Gap to undocumented
immigrants journeying from South America toward the U.S. border, even
though Molino has wisely asserted that the issues are separate and that
interdicting immigrants at the Darien Gap is in both Panama\'s and the
United States\'
interests. [\[9\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn9) 

Other potential risks include terrorist attacks on the canal if the U.S.
invades, disrupting a vital shipping route, and further weakening the
Organization of American States (OAS). Invading Panama would also risk
punishing a small but staunch U.S. ally that uses the U.S. dollar as
legal tender, supplies critical minerals like copper, combats illegal
immigration, and contributes to a significant U.S trade
surplus. [\[10\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn10)

Part II. The United States and the Panama Canal

An earlier issue brief provides a more detailed history of U.S.
construction and ongoing influence on the Panama
Canal. [\[11\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn11) In
summary, the United States took over the construction of a canal across
Panama after French efforts failed due to engineering challenges and
disease. The U.S. completed construction of the canal in 1914, a leading
example of U.S. power and technological abilities at the time. The U.S.
managed the completed canal under a 1914 treaty with no time limits,
exercising sovereignty over the "Panama Canal Zone" --- a 10-mile-wide
slice of American territory bisecting the Republic of Panama --- until
the conclusion of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty. That treaty replaced the
1914 treaty and provided for joint U.S.--Panamanian administration. It
remained in effect until Dec. 31, 1999, when it was replaced by the
"Neutrality
Treaty." [\[12\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn12)

The Carter administration's push for the 1977 treaty was motivated by
the challenges of defending the 1914 treaty under international law,
amid widespread Cold War tensions, human rights concerns, and the
reasonable threat of anti-American riots across Latin America. The
decision was also affected, in part, by rising demonstrations in Panama
against the U.S. presence, and by the realization that a canal dependent
on locks for ship transit --- with three sets of locks on both the
Atlantic and Pacific sides --- was highly vulnerable to terrorist
attacks despite significant U.S. military presence then stationed in the
Canal
Zone. [\[13\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn13)

Part III. Panamanian Sovereignty, a US Right of Intervention, and
Control Over Tolls

The Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, which ceded control of the canal to
Panama after a 22-year transition period, was terminated on Dec. 31,
1999. The 1977 treaty notably contained language in Article IV.2 to the
effect that the U.S. would retain the primary right and responsibility
to defend the canal's neutrality during the transition period only, in
order to ensure its continued operation. Since Jan. 1, 2000, control
over the canal has been governed by a separate Neutrality Treaty, which
grants no similar explicit right of involvement to the United States
government or the military. Under Article IV of this treaty, the U.S.
and Panama jointly guarantee that the canal will remain "permanently
neutral," without defining "neutrality" more
specifically. [\[14\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn14) Under
such circumstances, [even if Panama permitted]{.underline} such
[neutrality to be **jeopardized** by the Chinese]{.underline} or anyone
else, [the **Neutrality Treaty** provides no clear legal right to
**intervene**]{.underline} under the treaty, and international law would
provide no basis. It seems curious that, despite the U.S.-China trade
war that began almost a decade ago, serious questions have not been
raised earlier in the United States about Hong Kong/Chinese management
of Panamanian port facilities.

The lack of an unequivocal provision in the Neutrality Treaty for U.S.
involvement, excluded because of Panama's unsurprising concerns over its
sovereignty under the treaty, was of concern to many members of the
Senate and stakeholders elsewhere in the United States, resulting in
several efforts to provide an explicit basis for maintaining U.S.
intervention
rights. [\[15\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn15) The
first such effort to retain U.S. intervention rights was a joint
"Statement of Understanding" issued by President Jimmy Carter and
Panamanian leader General Omar Torrijos regarding the responsibility of
the two countries to maintain the canal's neutrality, stating:

"each of the two countries shall, in accordance with their respective
constitutional processes, defend the Canal against any threat to the
regime of neutrality and consequently shall have the right to act
against any aggression or threat directed against the Canal or against
the peaceful transit of vessels through the Canal.

This does not mean \[referring to the first paragraph\] nor shall it be
interpreted as a right of intervention of the United States in the
internal affairs of Panama. Any United States action will be directed at
ensuring that the Canal will remain open, secure and accessible and it
shall never be directed against the territorial integrity or political
independence of
Panama." [\[16\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn16)

Unsatisfied with this somewhat ambiguous language, the U.S. Senate added
two unilateral statements (or "reservations") to the Neutrality Treaty,
effectively seeking to amend it:

"If the Canal is closed or its operations are interfered with the United
States of America and the Republic of Panama shall each
independently have the right to take such steps as it deems necessary in
accordance with its constitutional processes including the use of
military force in Panama, to reopen the Canal or to restore the
operations of the Canal, as the case may
be." [\[17\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn17)

A month later, the predictable outcry from Panama led to a second Senate
reservation:

"Pursuant to its adherence to the principle of non-intervention, any
action taken by the United States of America in the exercise of its
rights to assure that the Panama Canal shall remain open, neutral,
secure and accessible, shall be only for the purpose of assuring that
the Canal shall remain open, neutral, secure and accessible, and shall
not have as its purpose or be interpreted as a right of intervention in
the internal affairs of the Republic of Panama or interference with its
political independence or sovereign
territory." [\[18\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn18)

Both reservations were accepted by the Panamanian government in 1978,
meaning Panama cannot argue today that they reflect only the U.S.
understanding, but the [second reservation appears to provide some
**basis** for Panama's assertion]{.underline} that [U.S. intervention
rights]{.underline} under the treaty [are
**limited**]{.underline}. [\[19\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn19) Practically
speaking, however, given Panama's limited national defense capabilities
and the unlikely scenario that it would fail to protect the canal's
neutrality, it seems clear that the U.S. would have little hesitation in
resorting to military action to uphold its intervention rights, if
necessary. That being said, the presence of Chinese or Hong
Kong-controlled port operators in Panama --- which have operated the
facilities since 1996 --- would appear to provide no legal or political
basis for U.S. intervention, under either the U.S. reservations attached
to the Neutrality Treaty or international
law. [\[20\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn20)

Also, under Article XIII.1, pertaining to the transfer of sovereignty
and control to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, the treaty states that, "Panama
shall assume total responsibility for the management, operation, and
maintenance of the Panama
Canal." [\[21\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn21)

Panama Retains Control Over Tolls

Under the Neutrality Treaty that remains in force, Panama also has
control over tolls. Still, significantly for purposes of this
discussion, the Neutrality Treaty specifies in Article III(c) that,
"Tolls and other charges for transit and ancillary services shall be
just, reasonable, equitable and consistent with the principles of
international law" --- although no mechanism is provided in the treaty
to resolve any differences over whether the tolls are "just, reasonable
and equitable," either by the U.S. and Panamanian governments or by the
canal's many
stakeholders. [\[22\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn22)

Still, this "just, reasonable, equitable and consistent with the
principles of international law" language provides at least some
constraint on Panama's discretion to raise tolls. Every major shipper
and consumer, whether American, European, Chinese, or otherwise, has a
legitimate interest in reasonable tolls and perhaps a potential right to
question the auction system, whereby ships can improve their place in
line by paying extra fees. In particular, the Jan. 1, 2025, toll
increases for most vessel types seem excessive to some expert observers.
These new tolls include a 200% increase in liquified natural gas (LNG)
tariffs over the past three years; for cargo ships, general increases of
18--220% over several years; and for containers, a 12.5 % increase per
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) for loaded containers and 200% for
empties.

As Jean-Paul Rodrigue, an expert on ocean shipping and supply chain
management, observes, "From the US standpoint, these increases can be
perceived as a disruptive and inflationary force, particularly for an
administration that has made the commitment to curb inflation and place
American interests at the
forefront." [\[23\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn23) The
question of the extent to which canal toll increases could measurably
raise overall U.S. inflation is well beyond the scope of this report,
however.

Despite these observations, the evidence suggesting these new tolls are
unreasonable remains inconclusive. As the president of Panama has noted,
"They are established in public meetings by the Panama Canal Authority,
and take into account market conditions, international competition,
operating and maintenance
costs." [\[24\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn24)

It is important to note that efforts to install new dams and other
facilities designed to conserve water supplies, probably essential for
the longer-term viability of the canal, could cost billions of
dollars. [\[25\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn25)

Regardless, [[many]{.underline}]{.mark} observers
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[**concerned** with]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} administration['s **heavy-handed**
approach]{.mark}]{.underline} than with the issue of toll levels or
Chinese influence itself. [[There would be no]{.mark}
**[justifiable]{.mark}** legal [basis]{.mark} for]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [[to **intervene**]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the operation of [the canal]{.underline}, even if it
could show that tolls are unreasonable. As noted above, legitimate
questions have arisen since the 2023--24 water shortages and high demand
led to significant toll increases, partly due to the limited number of
alternative routes that are economically
non-competitive. [\[26\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn26) Rather,
the appropriate remedies would be bilateral negotiations, mediation, or
third-party arbitration, depending on the willingness of the two parties
involved to
agree. [\[27\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn27)

Panama Has Proved a Competent Manager of the Canal

During the past 25 years, Panama has managed the canal, by all accounts,
in a highly competent
manner. [\[28\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn28) Panama
also successfully supervised a \$5 billion expansion of canal capacity
completed in 2016. The U.S. played no significant role in that project,
despite its obvious benefits to the United
States. [\[29\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn29) The
new locks allow wider, longer, and deeper container and other ships to
transit the canal, permitting them to use this key supply chain route
from Asia to major gulf and east coast ports such as Houston,
Charleston, Savannah, and Newark. Individual container ship capacity
increased significantly from 4,500 to 12,500 TEUs per
ship. [\[30\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn30) The
benefits for all stakeholders, despite the supply chain risks of larger
ships, seem obvious.

Part IV. China's Growing Economic Influence in Panama and Latin America

[China has been a **major** investor]{.underline} in [and trading
partner with Latin America]{.underline} for decades, in addition to the
multibillion-dollar Peruvian Chancay container port mentioned earlier.
For example, in one of its earliest investments, China's state-owned
company Shougang Hierro purchased the Marcona iron ore mine and smelter
in 1992, exporting the iron ore pellets back to Chinese steel mills. At
the time it was believed to be the largest Chinese investment in Latin
America. [\[31\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn31)

Another significant Latin American investment by China, discussed more
fully elsewhere in this report, is in the area around the
canal. [\[32\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn32) The
principal [**Balboa** and **Cristobal** container ports at the ends of
the canal have been operated by]{.underline} Hutchinson Port Holdings,
[a **Hong Kong** corporate entity]{.underline}, since
1995. [\[33\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn33) Additionally,
"in 2016, with a \$900 million investment, [the China-based Landbridge
Group, acquired **control** of Margarita Island, Panama's **largest**
port on the Atlantic]{.underline} side and in the Colón Free Trade Zone,
the largest free trade zone in the Western Hemisphere. The deal
established the Panama-Colón Container Port (PCCP) as a deep-water port
for megaships, and the construction and expansion was carried out by the
China Communications Construction Company
(CCCC)." [\[34\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn34)

Unproven Accusations Have Complicated the Matter

[Trump]{.underline} has [**accused** Panama]{.underline}, without any
apparent justification, [of **permitting** Chinese interests to operate
the canal. However, **none** of]{.underline} these [Chinese entities has
any role in]{.underline} the [operation]{.underline} of the canal
[or]{.underline} the [parallel railway]{.underline} across the isthmus.
Still, as Ryan C. Berg of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) notes, CK Hutchinson Holdings, the company managing the
ports of Balboa and Cristobal, "would likely have data on all ships
coming through the Panama Canal, giving it a data advantage. China also
has been using its shipping and maritime operations to gather foreign
intelligence and conduct
espionage." [\[35\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn35)

Under these circumstances it is not surprising that some U.S. observers
have expressed concern and that the Panamanian government has initiated
an audit of Hutchinson
Holdings. [\[36\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn36)

China's Investments in Latin America Are Significant

Beyond Panama, one source estimates that Chinese foreign direct
investment (FDI) in Latin America amounts to around \$12 billion as of
2022. Perhaps more significantly, between 2005 and 2020, China's
Development Bank and Export-Import Bank together loaned approximately
\$137 billion to Latin American governments, often in exchange for oil
or to fund energy and infrastructure
projects. [\[37\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn37) As
of May 2022, it was reported that seven Latin American countries
participate in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including
Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and
Uruguay. [\[38\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn38)

This investment data excludes Chancay (\$3.5 billion) and a BYD auto
plant now under construction in Brazil. Brazil has become a major auto
export market for China, with a BYD \$1.1 million investment in a former
Ford plant originally planned to go online in March 2005, and to be
producing 300,000 cars a year within two
years. [\[39\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn39) BYD's
progress in Brazil may be temporarily slowed by the discovery in late
December that 163 Chinese laborers hired by a contractor were living in
"slavery-like" conditions, as reported by Brazilian government
authorities. [\[40\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn40)

In other words, Chinese FDI in Latin America is not a future concern; it
has already arrived and can be expected to increase, particularly when
incentivized by the United States' economic and political actions over
the past several decades.

Tepid US Support for Latin American Economies Has Eroded Ally Unity in
the Region

In recent years, the United States has done little to demonstrate a
strong interest in support of Latin American economies. Other than the
USMCA, a trade agreement made by Mr. Trump in 2018 with Canada and
Mexico, the most recent free trade agreements with Peru, Panama, and
Central America/the Dominican Republic all were negotiated and went into
force almost 15 years
ago. [\[41\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn41)

The Biden administration's Alliance for Economic Prosperity in the
Americas (AEPA) appears to have produced relatively little of economic
importance, in significant part because domestic U.S. politics precluded
the offering of any increased access to the American
market. [\[42\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn42) This
all stands in stark contrast to China's economic programs including, but
not limited to, the BRI and other government-funded projects.

China's Growing Presence in Latin America and the Caribbean

China has also become a much more important trading partner to Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC) than the United States. According to the
World Economic Forum (WEF), trade between China and Latin America grew
from 2000--20 from \$12 billion to \$315 billion, while U.S. Latin total
trade between the U.S. and LAC stood at \$758 billion in
2020. [\[43\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn43)

Among the greatest export success stories, China is a major importer of
Latin American soybeans, principally from Brazil but also from
Argentina. While historically the United States was the world's largest
soybean exporter, that changed in 2013 when Brazil became the leading
exporter for the first time. Soybean exports from Brazil to China
amounted to \$38.9 billion in 2023, an increase of around 22% in
comparison to the previous year. China is by far the leading destination
for Brazilian soybean exports, accounting for nearly three-quarters of
the export
value. [\[44\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn44) Should
Trump decide to increase U.S. import duties on goods from China beyond
current levels, as has been threatened, China could well retaliate by
shifting additional soy purchases from the U.S. to
Brazil. [\[45\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn45)

Part V. Broader Indirect Risks of US-Panama Conflict

Although intangible, given the long history of U.S. military and
economic interventions in Latin America, the impact on regional
governments not directly affected by the threatened Panama Canal
intervention --- but concerned about similar actions in the future ---
should not be underestimated. According to one study:

"In the slightly less than a hundred years from 1898 to 1994, the U.S.
government has intervened successfully to change governments in Latin
America a total of at least 41 times. ... These incidents involved the
use of U.S. military forces, intelligence agents or local citizens
employed by U.S. government agencies. In another 24 cases, the U.S.
government played an indirect
role." [\[46\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn46)

Given the long history of such U.S. interference in the nations of Latin
America, beginning with the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, it is likely very
few of the 650 million inhabitants in Latin America over the age of 18,
including Mexico and the Caribbean, would hear Trump's Dec. 22, 2024,
threats without recalling at least one such prior incursion. The
inclusion of Greenland as a potential take-over target, and more
fanciful assertions that Canada should be annexed as the 51st U. S.
state, probably have not assuaged any regional concerns over Panama.

Panama's Neighbors Express Their Support 

In the current situation, solidarity for Panama's reaction to Trump's
threats was quickly expressed. Colombian President Gustavo Petro
immediately supported Panama, commenting, "If the new US government
wants to talk business, we will talk business, face to face, and for the
benefit of our people, but dignity will never be negotiated." This is on
behalf of a country that split off from Colombia with the help of
President Theodore Roosevelt in
1903. [\[47\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn47)

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has her own issues with Trump,
expressed her support for Panama's government by reiterating that, "the
Panama Canal belongs to the
Panamanians." [\[48\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn48)

Threat to Other US Initiatives

It seems obvious that Trump's plans to deport tens of thousands of
illegal immigrants and limit the number of new immigrants --- not only
from Mexico, but from many other Latin American nations --- would likely
be aided by a high level of cooperation from both home and transit
countries, especially key transit countries like Mexico, Panama, and
Colombia among others. Threats such as the present one are unlikely to
be helpful in assuring full cooperation. Even countries that are not
major sources of U.S. immigrants, such as Brazil and Peru, are unlikely
to welcome threats that all LAC countries realize could be directed at
them in the future for real or imagined slights.

While the new administration likely attaches little importance to the
Organization of American States (OAS), it can reasonably be assumed that
a unanimous or near unanimous OAS may castigate the U.S. for threatened
violations of OAS Charter Articles 19 (non-intervention) and 20
(prohibiting economic
coercion). [\[49\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn49) Eventually,
the U.N. General Assembly would likely pass a similar resolution
identifying a violation of Article 2 of the U.N.
Charter. [\[50\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn50)

A less likely, but potentially more substantive, threat to the global
trading system would occur only if significant numbers of Panama Canal
users decided, because of security concerns, to alter shipping routes
due to the threats and fear of actual closure. The risks of the extra
time and costs experienced for vessels, shippers, and ultimately
consumers may seem low at present, but should such an unlikely event
happen, the results would be catastrophic, whether caused by armed
conflict, domestic terrorism, or both. This is particularly true given
that one of the alternative routes, via the Red Sea and Suez Canal, is
currently being avoided by most vessels because of attacks on shipping
by Houthi
rebels. [\[51\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn51)

Some older readers may recall the 1965 conflict between British and
French forces and Egyptian dictator Gamel Adbel Nasser, which resulted
in military actions that closed the Suez Canal for
months. [\[52\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn52) While
this comparison may seem distant, it is worth noting that, due to the
Suez Canal's sea-level design, it is effectively more difficult to block
--- doing so typically requires sinking ships, as Nasser seemed to have
recognized when the canal was owned and controlled by British and French
commercial interests. While the Panamanian government would not sabotage
its own canal, there are concerns that terrorist groups, either from
Panama or elsewhere, might target the canal. Some observers worry that a
few strategically placed explosives could disable a series of locks for
days or weeks, particularly in light of recent
tensions. [\[53\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn53)

VI\. Conclusion

As is often the case with Trump, it is difficult to distinguish between
seemingly non-serious threats meant to pressure negotiations and those
signaling imminent action. Notably, prior to his January 2025
inauguration, Trump issued multiple threats (subject to modification or
revision) to raise tariffs by 10--20% on every U.S. trading partner.
China faces potential new tariffs of 10% or 60%, while Mexico and Canada
could see new 25% tariffs unless they, in Trump's view, take adequate
steps to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl. The BRICS nations have
been threatened with 100% tariffs if they develop a reserve currency to
challenge the dollar. Mexico also faces 100% tariffs on autos, and the
EU could face unspecified tariff increases if it does not buy more U.S.
natural
gas. [\[54\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn54)

While these actions could have significant negative effects on the
global and U.S. economies, including businesses and consumers, few
tariffs --- whether temporary or otherwise --- would likely have the
equivalent longstanding adverse political and economic impact on U.S.
relations with Latin America as an intervention in Panama or a
heightened political rivalry with China. An overly blunt approach to the
allegedly excessive tolls and undue Chinese influence allegations, with
not so veiled threats to retake control of the canal from Panama, could
cause damage even if not carried out. The indirect impact on U.S.
interests, particularly in the efforts to counter China in the region,
may already be significant due to the manner in which the threat has
been lodged. What, some may ask, is the difference between China ---
which claims Taiwan is a breakaway territory of China --- and the U.S.,
if the U.S. follows similar "wolf warrior" diplomacy, and demands that
the Canal Zone once again be U.S. territory, as it was from 1914 to
2000? [\[55\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn55)

Policy Recommendations

Regardless of what steps if any are taken next, [[it would be
prudent]{.mark} for]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[[to **tone down**]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}, unless a military intervention in
Panama is seriously being contemplated. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [appears to have arguable concerns over rising
**toll** levels, but]{.underline} the [most effective means to address
this]{.underline} would either [be bilateral negotiations
or]{.underline} some sort of independent expert analysis or [third-party
proceeding]{.underline}. This approach could also provide an opportunity
to formally raise other potential issues of concern, such as any
additional future involvement by Chinese or Hong Kong interests in or
around the canal that would call into question Panama's obligations
under the Neutrality Treaty.

[[Creating]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[crisis]{.mark} in
Panama]{.underline} and Latin America [[through **threats** of]{.mark}
economic or military **[intervention]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in the
absence of any real threat to the canal's neutrality; [[adding to
**uncertainties**]{.mark} about ocean shipping routes; [and giving
China]{.mark} a broader [**opportunity** to]{.mark}
increase]{.underline} its [[influence]{.underline}]{.mark} in Latin
America are all actions that [[do not serve]{.underline}]{.mark} the
United States' [[national **interest**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- even if
they were to ultimately result in lower canal tolls. [[Hopefully, Trump
will **reconsider**]{.mark} this]{.underline} New Year's gift to China,
Russia, and other nations opposed to U.S. interests. One cause for
guarded optimism is the announcement that the recently confirmed
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with his decades of experience in
Inter-American affairs, plans to visit Panama (and other Central
American nations) in early February 2025. It can be hoped that he will
be able to begin a negotiation that will ultimately result in resolving
the serious disagreements between the United States and Panama over
canal tolls and Chinese
influence. [\[56\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/adverse-consequences-us-threats-retake-panama-canal#_edn56) Rubio's
visit also presents an opportunity for both countries to reiterate and
strengthen their cooperation to interdict migrants who see crossing
Panama's Darien Gap jungle as a route to the United States.

[THE CHINA **MIRAGE**: **OVERSTATED** FEARS OF INFLUENCE]{.underline}

[[Much]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [recent [American **anxiety**]{.mark}
over the Canal [centers on China]{.mark} and]{.underline} its
[**perceived** expanding [presence]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}.
Yet [[the reality is]{.mark} far [more **nuanced**--and]{.mark}
significantly [less **threatening**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese firms
do indeed operate commercial port terminals at both the Atlantic and
Pacific entrances to the Canal, via concessions awarded back in 1997 to
the Hong Kong-based company Hutchison Ports (part of Hutchison Whampoa).
In other words, [Panama's port facilities have had]{.underline} a
[Chinese footprint for over **two decades**]{.underline}. Importantly,
[[there have been no new Chinese port
**concessions**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Panama Canal waterway
[since]{.underline} then, [[even during]{.mark} periods of [**intense**
Chinese **outbound** investment]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}. The
Hutchison-run terminals in Panama function like countless other
international port operations. Hutchison Ports, for instance, also
operates major terminals at both entrances of the Suez Canal and at
Felixstowe, the busiest container port in the United
Kingdom--essentially straddling the English Channel--as well as in other
key global trade hubs. They even manage the Freeport container terminal
in the Bahamas, less than 50 miles from the Florida coast. 

Yet, in each case, [[Hutchison is simply a
**client**]{.underline}]{.mark} or tenant [of]{.underline} the host
nation's [maritime authority, [not]{.mark} the **[controller]{.mark}**
of sovereign infrastructure]{.underline}. Panama is no exception. [The
[Panama]{.mark} Canal]{.underline} Authority (and by extension the
Panamanian State) [[remains in **full sovereign control**]{.mark} of the
canal and its waters. All port concessionaires, **Chinese** or
otherwise, operate under Panamanian **laws** and
**oversight**]{.underline}. And, unlike ports elsewhere run by
Hutchison, any vessel navigating toward a port terminal along the Panama
Canal must still relinquish command to a Panamanian Canal pilot upon
entering canal waters--an [**unequivocal** assertion of]{.underline}
Panamanian [authority that ensures no **foreign** entity can **dictate**
movement]{.underline} through the canal. Moreover, [[Hutchison's
presence is **far** from dominant]{.mark} in Panama's
overall]{.underline} shipping landscape: [[out of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[**five** major]{.mark} commercial [port]{.mark}
terminal[s]{.mark}]{.underline} adjacent to the Canal, [[Hutchison
manages **two**]{.underline}]{.mark}, while [the other [three
are]{.mark} operated [by **U.S.-allied**]{.mark}]{.underline} or other
multinational [[companies]{.underline}]{.mark}. 

[Recent developments **underscore** Panama's determination to
**safeguard**]{.underline} its [autonomy]{.underline}. After auditors
uncovered irregularities in the extension of Hutchison's port
concession, Panama's comptroller initiated a comprehensive audit and
legal review back in 2024. Those findings have sparked a series of
[[legal challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} that could [potentially
[**nullify** Hutchison's contract]{.mark} extension [and
**reopen**]{.mark}]{.underline} that port [concession
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} new bidders--possibly creating an opportunity
for [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} or allied [[firms]{.underline}]{.mark}
to step in. And, more recently in 2025, Hutchison announced that it was
in the midst of negotiations to sell a majority stake in one of its
Panama terminals to a U.S.-led consortium reportedly anchored by the
investment firm BlackRock. [[Far from **drifting** into China's orbit,
Panama is]{.mark} actively [courting more **American**
investment]{.mark} when it comes [to]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[**critical** infra]{.mark}structure]{.underline}. 

The broader context matters.  [In 2017]{.underline}, like many Latin
American countries at the time, [[Panama]{.underline}]{.mark} switched
its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing, opening the door to
official ties with the People's Republic of China. In the flush of this
new relationship, Panama's government initially [awarded **several**
high-profile infrastructure projects to [Chinese]{.mark}
companies]{.underline}--including a cruise ship port and a large highway
bridge over the Canal--and even joined China's Belt and Road Initiative.
However, [that early [momentum **slowed** significantly]{.mark} under
subsequent]{.underline} Panamanian [administrations,
[effectively]{.mark} grinding [to a **halt**. Not a **single**
new]{.mark} major [Chinese]{.mark} infrastructure [contract]{.mark} has
been granted [in]{.mark} the past **[five years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 

More recently, the administration of President José Raúl
[[Mulino]{.underline}]{.mark} (2024-present) has [[**explicitly**
indicated]{.underline}]{.mark} that [Panama will neither **renew** nor
expand its participation in **Belt and Road**]{.underline}. Instead,
President [Mulino]{.underline}'s government has [proactively
reaffirmed]{.underline} Panama's [strategic [**alignment** with
Washington]{.mark}, emphasizing]{.underline} that the country's
[long-term interests]{.underline} depend on deepening its ties with the
United States. In short, [[Beijing's inroads appear]{.mark} to have been
**[limited]{.mark}**, while [Panama continues]{.mark} to keep its most
**vital** asset--the Canal--firmly [**neutral** and **open**]{.mark} for
all]{.underline}.

### No market shift

#### Confluence of factors make it unsustainable.

There are [many]{.underline} types of [**ships**]{.underline} that might
[take **advantage** of ice-free waters]{.underline} in the future:
[naval]{.underline} vessels, [cruise]{.underline} ships,
[container]{.underline} ships, [scientific]{.underline} vessels, and
[transport ships to **offshore**]{.underline} drilling platforms.

[These]{.underline} ships would have to [contend with **myriad
challenges** in an increasingly ice-free Arctic.]{.underline} One of the
most prominent is the fact that [**ice** in the Arctic will **vary
drastically**]{.underline} year to year. "Regardless of which climate
change scenario path we're on, [interannual variability remained very
high]{.underline} for a long period," said Lynch, who led the latest
PNAS study.

Although [**83** of **more than 500,000** trips were
**shorter**]{.underline} and [**45 saved** sailing **time**]{.underline}
in Wang's sustainability analysis, only **[20 were economically
feasible]{.underline}**. "We definitely think that's a surprising
result, because people always talk about the Arctic as having great
potential for shipping."

[**Complications** don't stop there:]{.underline} It's
[**difficult**]{.underline} to get [Arctic **satellite navigation**
coverage, the ice is hard to **forecast**, emergency **operations** are
challenging, and shipping]{.underline} has various [**restrictions**
under the Polar Code]{.underline}, which [**limits** the sizes of
vehicles]{.underline} allowed. Wang has worried about the [effects of
**invasive species**]{.underline} on the fragile Arctic environment,
too.

#### The North-East Passage provides no benefits over the Panama Canal

[[A]{.mark} valid [question exists]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} [the

accurate]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is worth noting that transits through
the Northwest Passage have actually decreased in recent years -- 2019
saw 27 ships cross, down from the 2017 peak of 31. In 2018, colder
conditions and greater quantities of thicker ice proved so dangerous
that a mere five ships made successful transits.27[) The accessibility
of the Northwest Passage is key, as a mid-voyage switch to [the]{.mark}

[[As far as the **US** government is concerned]{.mark}, neither the Bush
administration nor the Obama administration have considered **China**'s
increasing involvement in the LAC region to be a major **threat** to US
**interests** in the region.]{.underline} The relative decline of the
USA's preeminent trading position and its political influence in the
region in recent years is largely considered to be the result of the
diminishment of its economic strength in the changing world economy as
well as its relative disinterest in the LAC region (compared to other
areas in the world such as the Middle East), and not a result of the
growth of Chinese influence in the region. Thus[, US policy analysts
such as Evan Ellis]{.underline} of the Center for Hemispheric Defense
Studies [believe [**China**'s **involvement** in the **LA**C region is
not a serious **threat**]{.mark} to the USA and he predicts without
concern that "[the PRC's economic presence in and political impact on
Latin America will remain a permanent fixture of the hemisphere]{.mark},
alongside that of the European Union, India and a host of other
extra-regional actors"]{.underline} (Ellis, 2012: 13). In a report to US
Congress, another US analyst Frank Sullivan (2014:1) has stated: ["U.S.
**policy** toward the region is conducted in the context of a Latin
America that is becoming increasingly **independent** from the United
States" but the USA "remains the single largest trading partner for many
countries" in the region]{.underline} (page 8)

[**Latin American** and Caribbean countries have diversified their
**economic** and **diplomatic ties** with countries outside the region.
**China**]{.underline}, for example, has become a major trading partner
for many countries in the region, ranking as one of the top two export
and import markets. Total Chinese trade with the region grew from almost
\$18 billion in 2002 to about \$259 billion in 2012. Nevertheless, [the
United States remains the single largest trading partner for many
countries; total U.S. trade with the region amounted \$845 billion in
2012]{.underline}, more than three times that of China's trade with the
region

Ellis (2012:5) notes that "[while the purchase of goods from China has,
to some degree, displaced the Latin American purchase of products from
US companies, in many cases US-registered companies actually produce
part or all of their products in the PRC or they source components
there, increasing the competitiveness of those goods as they sell them
to Latin America and other markets."]{.underline} In November 2013, US
Secretary of State John Kerry made clear in his address to the
Organization of American States that the "Era of the Monroe Doctrine is
over," and [[the **U.S.** will not try to **prevent** the sovereign
**states** of Latin America and the Caribbean from developing
**relationships** with the **PRC**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ellis, 2014).
In fact, [the Chinese government's official position on this question
is: "[**China** **understands** the **sensitive** character of its
deepening **ties**]{.mark} with **L**atin **A**merica, a region
traditionally perceived as the backyard of the United States, [and in no
way should China's growing presence be **interpreted** as a
**challenge** to **U.S. heg**emony in the
hemisphere]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Jiang, 2008:28).

China and South-South Cooperation

The PRC's policy paper on its relations with the LAC region states that
[[the primary **goal**]{.mark} of the PRC's relations with the LAC
countries [is]{.mark} to "**leverage** their respective **strengths**,
tap the full potential of **cooperation**, and seek to become each
other\'s partners in economic cooperation and trade for mutual benefit
and common development."]{.underline} In essence, this is consistent
with the primary goal of South-South Cooperation as it is officially
defined internationally. According to the United Nations Office for
South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC, 2016:1) South-South Cooperation (SSC)
involves: [["**collaboration**]{.mark} among countries of the South in
the political, **economic**, social, cultural, environmental and
technical **domains**," through sharing "knowledge, skills, expertise
and resources to meet their development goals through concerted
efforts,"]{.underline} and while it generally "involves two or more
developing countries, it can take place on a bilateral, regional,
subregional or interregional basis."

The term "South" in South-South Cooperation refers to the "Global South"
and includes all the developing countries, which are for the most part
located in the southern hemisphere of the planet (UNDP, 2016). According
to the UNOSSC, South-South cooperation is a broad concept and in recent
decades it has encompassed an "increased volume of South-South trade,
South-South flows of foreign direct investment, movements towards
regional integration, technology transfers \[and\] financial and
monetary cooperation and in-kind contributions." In a complementary
manner, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
has defined SSC as "a methodology of development which facilitates the
exchange of knowledge, experience, investment, information and capacity
between and among Southern countries through government, civil society
organizations, academic institutions, national institutions and networks
to accelerate political, economic, social, cultural, environmental and
technical development" (UNIDO, 2016).UNIDO also states that SSC has
become "a key mechanism for the development agenda of countries in the
South and is guided by mutual benefit between countries, respect for
national sovereignty and ownership, establishment of partnership among
equals, non-conditionality in cooperation and non-interference in
domestic affairs" (UNIDO, 2016). According to the documents of the LAC
intergovernmental organization entitled the Latin American and Caribbean
Economic System (Sistema Económico Latinoamericano y del Caribe or
SELA), SSC should be based on "the basic principles of solidarity, 8
complementarity, equality, non-conditionality and respect for
sovereignty" between the countries involved (SELA, 2016). The
Secretariat of the United Nations Economic Commission of Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) points out that SSC has become "an alternative
form of international cooperation which operates parallel to the
traditional mechanisms of official development assistance" (SELA, 2016).
These two conceptualizations of SSC distinguish it from the traditional
hegemonic system of North-South international development cooperation,
which has been criticized as a vertical, topdown and unidirectional
pattern of support in which the advanced capitalist countries in the
Global North have granted various forms of assistance to the developing
countries in the Global South provided they follow certain political
conditions set down by the former that are aimed at shaping the
economic, social and political affairs of the recipient countries
(Santander Campos, 2012: 1226 and 1229). This traditional North-South
pattern of international development cooperation, often referred to as
Official Development Assistance (ODA) is increasingly being offset by
SSC and the conditions created by the emerging multipolar international
order. China's leaders believe that the globalization of trade, finance,
and communications has produced a more complex and interdependent world
economy in which the hegemonic capitalist countries are no longer able
to prevent or control the diffusion and redistribution of both economic
and political power. As a result, they believe a new multipolar world
order is emerging and that it is being shaped by the larger developing
countries such as China, Brazil, India and South Africa along with the
support of other developing countries in the Global South (Santander
Campos, 2012: 1229). The embryonic emergence of this new international
order has given rise to the proliferation of a growing number of
regional, sub-regional as well as inter-regional forms of economic and
political cooperation such as the inter-regional BRICS coalition
(Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), the regional Union of
South American Nations (Spanish: Unión de Naciones Suramericanas,
UNASUR; Portuguese: União de Nações SulAmericanas, UNASUL), the
sub-regional Mercosur or Mercosul (Spanish: Mercado Común del Sur,
Portuguese: Mercado Comum do Sul; English: the Southern Common Market),
the inter-regional Community of Latin American and Caribbean States
(Spanish: Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños, CELAC;
Portuguese: Comunidade de Estados Latino-Americanos e Caribenhos) and
the new inter-regional cooperation forum that has been established
between China and the CELAC nations - the China-CELAC Forum (Foro
China-CELAC). CELAC includes all the countries in the Western
Hemisphere, except the USA and Canada, and it was set up in 2011 as an
alternative to the Washington-based Organization of American States
(OAS). At the Second Summit of CELAC, held in Havana, Cuba in January
2014, the creation of the China-CELAC Forum was proposed by Cuba and
approved by the other CELAC members (McKelvey, 2014). On July 17, 2014,
after the conclusion of the Sixth Summit of the BRICS coalition in the
Brazilian city of Fortaleza, the heads of state of China and the leading
quartet of the CELAC countries formally established the China-CELAC
Forum. The first ministerial meeting of this forum was held in Beijing
on January 8-9, 2015 and it produced a comprehensive 5 year plan for
cooperation between China and the 9 CELAC countries over the period
2015-2019. This comprehensive cooperation plan involves trade,
investment, finance, infrastructure, energy, natural resources,
industry, agriculture, science and people-to-people exchanges
(China-CELAC Forum, 2015).

This new inter-regional forum represents an [important **development**
in the **strengthening** of **economic**, **social** and **political**
**relations** between **China** and the nations of **Latin America** and
the Caribbean and represents a major development in South-South
cooperation between China and the LAC countries]{.underline} (McKelvey,
2014).

At the first ministerial meeting of the [China-CELAC Forum]{.underline}
held in Beijing in January 2015, President Xi Jinping gave the opening
speech entitled "Jointly Writing a New Chapter of the China-CELAC
Comprehensive Cooperative Partnership\" (MFAPRC, 2015). In this speech
he stressed that the convening of the first annual ministerial meeting
of the Forum marked the translation from conception into reality of
comprehensive region-wide effort at cooperation between China and the
CELAC countries. [He also said it sent the world a **positive signal**
of the deepening cooperation between their nations for their joint
development, and that this undertaking would exert "significant and
profound influence on the promotion of **South-South cooperation** as
well as world prosperity and progress."]{.underline} In addition,
President Xi put forward four principles for the future development of
the ChinaCELAC Forum. They are as follows (MFAPRC, 2015):

First, adhere to the cooperation principle of equal treatment as well as
the idea of friendly discussion, joint construction and achievement
sharing, so as to lay a solid political foundation for overall
cooperation. Second, adhere to the cooperation objective of mutual
benefits and win-win results, firmly hold onto the main theme of common
development, and strive for early harvest as well as realization of the
effect of 1 plus 1 becomes greater than 2. Third, adhere to flexible and
practical approaches of cooperation and carry out various forms of
cooperation through bilateral and multilateral channels to achieve
mutual supplementation of advantages. Fourth, adhere to the open and
inclusive spirit of cooperation and take into full consideration
different interests and demands of relevant parties.

Xi also welcomed other regional organizations and multilateral
institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean to actively participate
in the regional cooperation between China and the CELAC countries.

As Ellis (2014) has noted it is likely that the China-CELAC Forum will
operate in a manner similar to the FOCAC (Forum on China-Africa
Cooperation), which was established in 2000. In this regard, Ellis
suggests it will most likely serve as a vehicle for advancing Chinese
economic relations within the LAC region through multilateral loan
funds, agreements in areas such as finance, phytosanitary
certifications, investments, and that it will give highlevel political
attention to important commercial projects. To the extent that the new
China-CELAC Forum follows in the footsteps of FOCAC and the objectives
of China's own 2008 White Paper toward Latin America and the Caribbean,
it is also likely to create a region-wide framework for educational and
cultural exchanges, including the establishment of Confucius Institutes
and scholarships for LAC students to stud PRC, and expand cooperation in
science and technology, telecommunications, space, military and other
areas between China and the LAC countries.

It is important to note that from the Chinese perspective these forms of
cooperation contribute to transforming the international order and
promoting the independent economic, social and political development of
all the countries involved. Most of these efforts are basically
anti-neoliberal in orientation and based on various forms of SouthSouth
cooperation. These forms of cooperation go beyond neoliberal trade
liberalization measures and seek to intensify South-South relations and
consolidate strategic partnerships between China and the LAC countries
(ECLAC, 2015a; Fernandez and Hogenboom, 2010). They seek to not only
promote the mutual development of the countries involved, but also
[**increase** the **power** of the developing countries in general in
**regulating** the increasingly globalized world **economy** and laying
the foundations for a new non-hegemonic and multipolar international
political order]{.underline} (Santander Campos, 2012: 1229-1230).

The China-CELAC Forum reflects the strategic nature of the PRC's
cooperative relations with the LAC countries and specific objectives for
guiding China's official relations with these countries specified in the
2008 Policy Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean. Thus, in the
domain of political relations, the policy paper states that the PRC's
specific objectives are to promote high-level exchanges with the leaders
of the LAC countries, as well as the establishment and maintenance of
political and business consultation mechanisms, and efforts at
cooperation and coordination aimed at [**making** the **international
order** more just and **equitable** by upholding the legitimate rights
and interests of developing countries, and by **supporting** a greater
**role** for the **Latin American** and Caribbean **countries** in
international affairs]{.underline} (SCPRC, 2012). These last objectives
are directly related to the PRC's strategic goal of enlisting the
cooperation of the LAC countries in reforming the present international
order, dominated by the United States of America (USA) and the other
members of the Group of 7 countries (i.e., Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom). [This is an **important** goal of
the **PRC**'s **fo**reign **po**licy, and the Chinese leaders frequently
make this clear]{.underline} in their foreign policy announcements,
overseas media communications and in most international political venues
(Zhu, 2014).

South-South cooperation is a strategic goal of the PRC's foreign aid
policies. Thus, in the preface of the PRC's white paper on China's
Foreign Aid (Lu, 2014), issued by the State Council of the PRC in July
2014, the opening paragraph of the preface states:

[China is the world\'s largest developing country. In its development,
it has endeavored to integrate the interests of the Chinese people with
people of other countries, providing assistance to the best of its
ability to other developing countries within the framework of
**South-South cooperation** to support and help other developing
countries, especially the least developed countries (LDCs), to **reduce
poverty** and improve livelihood. China has proactively promoted
international development and cooperation and played a constructive role
in this aspect.]{.underline}

The second paragraph of the preface sets forth the principles guiding
China's foreign assistance. It states: "When providing foreign
assistance, China adheres to the principles of not imposing any
political conditions, not interfering in the internal affairs of the
recipient countries and fully respecting their right to independently
choosing their own paths and models of development," and it also states
"the basic principles China upholds in providing foreign assistance are
mutual respect, equality, keeping promise, mutual benefits and winwin"
(Lu, 2014).

This important policy document as well as many others issued by the PRC
reveal that [the PRC's leaders see **China** as a developing country and
they want its **relations** with other developing countries to be based
on **South-South** and **win-win** cooperation rather than a Chinese
version of hegemonic **North-South** **win-lose** relations, which the
PRC explicitly and repeatedly repudiates.]{.underline} In this regard,
China has taken a leading role in the efforts of the BRICS coalition
(Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to advance their common
strategy of changing the existing international order and promoting the
equitable development of the developing countries (Mishra, 2014).

While the Marxist political ideology of China's leaders profoundly
influences their worldview and their political strategies (see Harris,
2015a), [the Chinese government does not draw strict ideological lines
in the PRC's trade relations and the assistance its gives to other
countries.]{.underline} The PRC's official position is "various social
systems and development models should coexist harmoniously in the
world," and as a result ["China is committed to developing friendly
relations and cooperation with all countries on the basis of sincerity,
friendship, equality, mutual respect, and their common
development"]{.underline} (Aho, 2011).

Nevertheless, in Latin America and the Caribbean (and elsewhere), it is
clear the PRC has friendlier and more cooperative relations with the
countries that have leftist and centerleft regimes with political ideals
that are closer to those of China's leaders (Alvaro and Minay, 2015),
such as Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela, and somewhat
less friendly but still respectful cooperative relations with countries
such as Colombia and Mexico, which are led by more conservative, pro-US
regimes. While the PRC does not have diplomatic relations with the
countries in Central America and the Caribbean that continue to maintain
diplomatic ties with Taiwan (Jiang, 2008:36-37), in certain cases it
does have favorable commercial relations with some of these countries
such as Nicaragua (which has a leftist regime). Since 2008, both the PRC
and Taiwan have suspend their previous efforts to change the diplomatic
posture of the states recognizing the other. This tacit diplomatic truce
has kept Beijing from acting upon the interest expressed by certain
Central American and Caribbean governments in changing their diplomatic
ties from Taiwan to the PRC (Ellis, 2014; Tiezzi, 2016). The best
example of China's relations with leftist regimes in the LAC region are
its relations with Cuba. Sino-Cuban relations have deepened rapidly
since the beginning of the twentyfirst century, propelled by both their
shared political ideology and economic interests. According to Mao,
Hearn, and Liu (2015), a shared commitment to socialism with 'local
characteristics' has enabled the pursuit of an unusually broad range of
cooperative ventures between the PRC and Cuba, These initiatives include
Chinese investments in 12 Cuba's nickel and oil sectors, educational and
medical exchange programs, the development of tourism, and engagement
with the Chinese diaspora in Cuba. These areas of cooperation reflect a
combination of both state and market forces. Sino-Cuban relations
reflect their strong ideological affinities, which is revealed in their
intergovernmental accords and diplomacy, and the fact that the leaders
of these two countries view their cooperation as basically socialist in
character (Mao, Hearn, and Liu, 2015:140-141). In this regard, it is
important to note that "China has taken concrete steps to provide Cuba
with new technology so that it can develop its own industries rather
than simply importing Chinese manufactured goods" (page 141). According
to Mao, Hearn and Liu: Although nickel is China's main import from Cuba,
the bilateral trade profile differs from that of other countries. China
has taken concrete steps to provide Cuba with new technology so that it
can develop its own industries rather than simply importing Chinese
manufactured goods and simultaneously avoid becoming dependent on
resource exports. Avoiding the "resource curse" is a common topic of
discussion between Cuban and Chinese officials and researchers, who have
developed programs for industrial diversification through light
manufacturing, pharmaceutical production, tourism, and educational
exchange. In fact, avoiding the "resource curse" is a common concern
among both the Cuban and Chinese officials who have "developed programs
for industrial diversification through light manufacturing,
pharmaceutical production, tourism, and educational exchange." According
to Mao, Hearn and Liu (2015:150-151), the intensification of Sino-Cuban
relations over the past decade appears to have not posed a challenge to
the United States, and the renewal of diplomatic relations with the US
government has opened the possibility of new opportunities for trilater
cooperation. In the larger global context, China's relations with the
developing countries and the increase in SSCbetween the developing
countries has become a major factor in contemporary international
relations and this is closely linked to the increasing flow of trade,
investments, loans, economic cooperation and technical assistance taking
place between the developing countries. For this reason, the "phenomenal
rise of the South and the surge in South-South cooperation" have
increasingly become the subject of contemporary research and analysis
(UNGA, 2014, :8). According to a report prepared for the 2014 session of
the United Nations General Assembly by the Secretary General (UNGA,
2014:11), the value of South-South cooperation was estimated to be
between US\$16.1 billion and US\$19 billion in 2011. However, this
figure seriously underestimates the importance of SSC and in this regard
the United Nations Capital Development Fund has stated "the value of
South-South cooperation and assistance is enormous when we consider the
'bundling' of financial assistance with trade, investment and (often
trade-related) technical cooperation" (UNCDF, 2016).

South-South Trade between China and the LAC Region

[The economies of the developing countries, the Global South, now
produce nearly half of the world's economic output measured in terms of
Gross World Product]{.underline} (GWP), which represents the combined
total of the gross domestic products of all the countries in the world
(UNGA, 2014:2). The developing countries share of the GWP jumped
remarkably from 23 to 40 per cent between 2000 and 2012, and their share
of total world trade increased from 39 percent to 52 percent during this
period (WTO, 2014:60). According to the 2014 Report of the Secretary
General of the United Nations on the State of South-South Cooperation
(UNGA, 2014:2) predicted the following:

By 2025, the South is likely to account for 600 million households with
incomes of over \$20,000 and an overall annual consumption of \$30
trillion. All regions of the South have experienced growth and they have
done so during the most severe recession in the North since the Great
Depression. Those unprecedented achievements and prospects, in
combination with the rapid spread of electronic connectivity across the
South, point to a new strength and effectiveness for South-South
cooperation.

[South-South development cooperation is directly linked to the growing
trade and flows of]{.underline} foreign direct investment [(FDI) between
developing countries, and both of these factors are transforming the
world economy.]{.underline} In addition, since 2009, the developing
countries have exported more to each another than to the developed
countries; and since 2011, their total trade has been over US\$4
trillion (UNGA, 2014:2).

By 2020, the economies of the three largest developing countries --
China, India and Brazil\-- are projected to produce a greater share of
the Gross World Product (GWP) than the six largest developed countries
of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United
States of America (UNGA, 2014:2). Table 1 shows the annual "regional"
percentages of GWP growth between 2006 and 2016 based on data from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s World Economic Outlook database.

![A table with numbers and numbers AI-generated content may be

height="1.8335892388451445in"}

As Table 1 indicates, [since 2006 the average annual growth of the gross
domestic product of the developing countries has been considerably
higher than the rate of growth of the so called advanced
economies]{.underline} (i.e., the economies of countries such as
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and
the United States of America) and most of the economies of the Eurozone
(i.e., the group of countries which use the Euro as their currency). The
rate of economic growth in the South has also been higher than the
average growth rate of the GWP (i.e., the world average in Table 1).

Much of the increase in the South's share of the world's economic output
has been due to the economic growth of the larger G-20 developing
economies such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, etc..
These G-20 developing economies account for over 60 per cent of the
world's population (WTO, 2014:40). They have helped stimulate economic
growth and increased income in the rest of the developing countries,
including the least developed countries (LDCs). For example,
[**China**'s increasing **demand** for imported commodities during the
2000s **contributed** to higher commodity prices in the world
**market**, and these higher prices "**boosted incomes** in the
resource-exporting developing countries," including many of the **Latin
American countries**]{.underline} (WTO, 2014:5).

As a recent WTO report (WTO, 2014:5) indicates, the development of the
G-20 developing economies has transformed the distribution of the
world's income. More specifically, this report indicates the development
of the G-20 countries has narrowed the gap in incomes between the rich
and poor nations and reduced the income inequality between countries.
According to this report (WTO, 2014:5):

[The **distribution** \[of the world's **income**\] has become more
**equal** overall through decreases in inequality between
countries.]{.underline} Until 2000, the distribution was characterized
by two peaks, one representing poor developing economies and the other
corresponding to rich developed economies. Thereafter, the developing
economies' convergence has narrowed the gap between rich and poor
nations. Most notably a third peak has emerged in the middle, reflecting
the higher growth of many G-20 developing countries, such as China,
relative to other developing countries.

[This shift in income distribution is related to the increasing exports
of the larger G-20 economies, such as China, which appear to "have
helped the entire group of developing countries to increase their share
in world exports from 25 per cent to 36 per cent between 2000 and
2012"]{.underline} (WTO, 2014:60). Actually, China more than doubled its
share of world exports from 7 per cent to 15 per cent during this
period, while India recorded a substantial but more modest increase of
its share of world exports from 4 to 6 per cent of world exports.
However, despite Brail's and Mexico's substantial amount of economic
growth between 2000 and 2012, Brazil's share of world exports remained 3
per cent during this 12 year period and Mexico's share of world exports
dropped from 3 to 2 per cent by the end of this period (WTO, 2014:60).
Furthermore, even though the G-20 larger developing economies have
reduced their income gap with the advanced economies, these larger
developing economies still have a long road ahead of them to catch up to
the incomes of the advanced economies (WTO, 2014:60). 15 [It is highly
significant that in recent years many of the developing countries have
increased their trade with China and other G-20 larger developing
countries relative to their trade with the developed/advanced economies
in the Global North]{.underline}. This is particularly the case in
Africa, where the share of African exports to the developed/advanced
economies fell from 70 percent in 1995 to 53 percent in 2012 (WTO,
2014:70). A similar but less pronounced trend has taken place in Latin
America, South and Central Asia and the Middle East. Significantly, [for
most of the developing countries, the expansion of their trade with
China and other G-20 larger developing countries has resulted in an
increase in the total volume of their exports and the diversification of
their trading partners, while not diverting to a great extent their
trade away from the developed countries]{.underline} (WTO, 2014:70).

Increasing trade with China and other G-20 larger developing countries
has reduced what the WTO economists call the "output volatility" of the
developing countries (WTO, 2014:70). This concept (see Gounder and Saha,
2007:4) refers to the vulnerability of these countries to the impacts of
"external shocks" on both the prices and the demand for their exports
(output). That is to say, [**increased trade** with countries such as
China has in general helped to **reduce** the **vulnerability** to
external **shocks** of the developing countries that export
commodities]{.underline} (WTO, 2014:173), even though in the last few
years China's demand and the demand of other large developing economies
for their commodity exports has declined or stopped expanding as much as
it did during the first decade of the 2000s.

For example, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the rapid growth in
exports of commodities to China from the region between 2000 and 2012
contributed to the accelerated economic growth of most of the countries
in the region and enabled these countries to diversify both the
destination of their exports as well as the suppliers of their imports,
thereby reducing their traditional economic dependency on the USA and
Europe (see ECLAC, 2013a:41-42 and Harris, 2015b:169-172).

However, the slow-down in China's economic growth since 2012 and the new
economic strategy it is now following have contributed to a relative
decline in both the quantity and prices of most of the commodities that
China imports from Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, 2015). Other
important factors responsible for this decline include a continuing over
production and supply of export commodities, relatively weak global
demand for these commodities, the strengthening of the dollar and the
declining exchange rates of the currencies in many of these countries
(UNDESA, 2015: 3 and 9).

It is important to emphasize that [**China's** new **economic
strategy** - which involves shifting the emphasis of the development of
its economy away from producing manufactures for export to promoting
increasing domestic consumption of services as well as consumer goods
produced in China - provides an **opportunity** for the **Latin
American** and the Caribbean **countries** to **diversify** their
**exports** to China and thereby offset the decline in their export of
primary commodities to China.]{.underline} In particular, the region has
a [opportunity to diversify its exports by **producing** more
**agricultural** and **food products** for export to China]{.underline},
which according to forecasts will double its imports of these kinds of
products by 2020 (ECLAC, 2015b). In this regard, Davidson (2012:
199--201) has argued that: "[**Brazil**'s natural endowment of fresh
water, in **combination** with **China**'s receding ability to feed
itself, guarantees a deepening of the trade ties between the two
countries]{.underline}, since no other country in the world has both the
freshwater and the farmland to convert water into food at the scale
Brazil can," and as evidence of this Davidson points out that "Brazil
produces a quarter of the world's soybean exports on just 6 percent of
the country's arable land."

[Global agricultural **trade**]{.underline}, particularly that of key

[[**environmental** and **geopolitical** **crises** at]{.mark} the

heightened military tensions in the Red Sea due to the attacks of the
Houthi terrorist group on commercial shipping lanes, [have
[caused]{.mark} substantial [**logistical** challenges and **economic**
repercussions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Figure 1 shows that since late
November 2023, global trade has been rerouted to the Cape of Good Hope,
via which 85 percent of global container vessels traveled in January
2024. In particular, the Panama Canal's drought, which has led to a
reduction in the number of daily transits, impacts the timely and
cost-effective transportation of U.S. farm products to Asian markets.

![A graph of a number of different colored bars AI-generated content may

height="2.6670384951881014in"}

Simultaneously, the geopolitical instability in the Red Sea has required
the [rerouting of shipping lanes, resulting in extended transit times
and a dramatic surge in freight rates.]{.underline} [These
[issues]{.mark} have not only [underscored]{.mark} the [**fragility**
of]{.mark} key [maritime **routes**]{.mark} but [also]{.mark} have had
[a cascading **effect**]{.mark} on global **agricultural supply
chains**, having the potential to disrupt 2024 U.S. agricultural exports
severely.]{.underline} [The potential implications for exporters of
major crops like **corn** and **soybeans** are considerable,
encompassing increased transportation costs, potential delivery
delays]{.underline}, and a broader reassessment of trade strategies.
[This [situation highlights a **critical** challenge for global
trade]{.mark}, which is the increasing interdependence of
**environmental stability** and geopolitical disruptions and their
**impact** on the flow of agricultural commodities, which are pivotal
for **U.S. farmers** and ranchers.]{.underline}

[The **Panama Canal**, an essential trade corridor linking the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans,]{.underline} has been severely impacted by its most
severe drought. [This environmental crisis has necessitated **drastic**
operational **cutbacks**, profoundly reducing the canal's
capacity.]{.underline} For instance, the daily transits through the
Panama Canal's Panamax and Neopanamax locks have decreased by 30
percent, marking a substantial reduction in operational throughput, as
shown in Figure 2. [This decrease in capacity impacts nearly **three
percent** of global maritime trade **volumes** as they transit through
the Panama Canal]{.underline}. This route is predominantly used by dry
bulk carriers, container ships, chemical and crude product tankers, and
liquefied petroleum gas carriers. Notably, container ships have suffered
less from the increase in waiting times for transit, which averaged five
days in July and escalated to more than three weeks in January 2024

![A graph of a number of people AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image3.png){width="3.698432852143482in"
height="2.68787510936133in"}

The implications of these operational changes are threefold: lower
throughput, longer delays, and higher costs. The booking restrictions
have reduced the number of vessels passing through, and ships are
lightening loads to meet draft reductions. Vessels unable to secure a
booking or those missing their bookings due to previous delays may now
face waiting times of up to two to three weeks for a new slot at the
canal. Moreover, the increased waiting time for transit has led to
tighter vessel capacity, which is expected to raise spot rates even
further, especially for the route from the U.S. East Coast to Asia. If
rerouting is required, substantially higher shipping costs associated
with the extra two weeks of sailing around Cape Horn will be incurred.
The Panama Canal Authority and ocean carriers have also announced
surcharges related to canal transit, which may continue to be
implemented or increased.

[This development is particularly **concerning** for U.S. agricultural
**exporters**, as about [**40 percent** of North American container
**vessels**]{.mark} and bulk carriers [pass through the canal]{.mark}
annually, [**carrying** key agricultural **products**]{.mark} such as
**[grains]{.mark}** and **[oilseeds]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The Panama
[Canal is integral to U.S. **exports** to **Asia**]{.mark}, with over
[26 percent of **soybeans**]{.mark} and [17 percent of **corn**]{.mark}
exported via this route in the fiscal year 2022]{.underline}. [These
exports are **[crucial]{.mark}**, particularly [considering **China**'s
**dependency** on **grain** imports]{.mark}]{.underline}, which may
increase due to expected smaller crops in other regions like Australia
and South America. The U.S. grain export season typically begins in
mid-October and lasts through May of the following year, and
persistently low water levels at the Panama Canal could significantly
impact these exports.

Concurrently, the Red Sea passage has been impacted severely by
increased military tensions and attacks on commercial cargo vessels
since December 2023, as shown in Figure 3. These geopolitical tensions
have necessitated the redirecting of shipping lanes, leading to extended
transit times and a dramatic escalation in freight rates. A direct
consequence of the blockage has been the surge in ocean freight rates.
Figure 4 shows the average cost of transporting a standard container
(measured as a twenty-foot equivalent unit, TEU), which has increased
from about USD 700 in November 2023 to over USD 1,900 in January 2024.
The situation in the Red Sea is expected to push near-term shipping
prices even higher, with projections indicating that shipping rates
could surpass USD 3,000 per TEU as substantial agricultural shipping
volumes shift toward the U.S. West Coast.

![A graph of a graph AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image4.png){width="3.615087489063867in"
height="2.6774573490813647in"}

The substantial increase in freight rates has resulted in considerable
added costs for transporting agricultural commodities, directly
impacting U.S. exporters of corn and soybeans. The crisis has led to
notable delays in shipping schedules. Median days for vessel schedules
running late have increased threefold on some lanes, with approximately
448 vessels rerouted as of January 6, 2024. The estimated delay for
impacted vessels has reached three weeks, considerably longer than
usual. These shipping delays compound the challenges U.S. agricultural
exporters face, as they disrupt the timely delivery of goods and add
further complexity to an already strained global agricultural supply
chain.

Looking at what to expect in 2024, the agricultural sector faces
considerable uncertainties amid ongoing environmental and geopolitical
challenges. The Panama Canal grapples with one of its most severe
droughts. This has resulted in substantial operational cutbacks. The
current water level at Lake Gatún, which feeds into the canal, is about
7 percent below the five-year average. While some improvement is
anticipated as the rainy season progresses, water levels will remain
below average due to strengthening El Niño conditions and predicted
droughts in Central America for the remainder of 2024. The impact of
these changes on U.S. agricultural shipments to Asia via the Panama
Canal is multifold. Vessels that experience delays may need to wait up
to three weeks for a new slot at the canal. This increased waiting time
will likely lead to tighter vessel capacity and a consequent rise in
spot rates. Some shippers may reroute via Cape Horn or the Cape of Good
Hope, resulting in additional shipping costs due to the extra two to
four weeks of sailing.

Given these conditions, the 2024 outlook suggests continued challenges
for U.S. agricultural exports, particularly for critical commodities
such as corn and soybeans. These uncertainties will require stakeholders
to adapt to the increasingly uncertain global market environment. This
adaptation may involve diversifying logistical plans, exploring
alternative shipping routes, adjusting schedules, and possibly seeking
new markets to mitigate the risks of reduced canal capacity and
disruptions in key shipping lanes. The focus will be on developing more
resilient and adaptable trade practices, underlining the need for
flexible supply chain solutions that can withstand the pressures of
environmental changes and geopolitical instabilities.

The crises in the Panama Canal and the Red Sea have highlighted the
vulnerabilities of U.S. agricultural trade to environmental and
geopolitical factors. These disruptions have increased transportation
costs, prolonged transit times, and potential market losses. It is
increasingly clear that the development of sustainable and flexible
supply chain solutions is not just advantageous but essential for
maintaining and enhancing the flow of U.S. agricultural trade. The U.S.
agricultural sector must adopt more robust strategies. Investing in
diversified trade routes, alternative markets, and innovative logistics
solutions will be key. [Understanding the [**interconnected** nature
of]{.mark} global **[supply chains]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
**[external factors]{.mark}** that influence them is vital.]{.underline}
[As the environmental and geopolitical landscapes evolve]{.underline},
the capacity to anticipate, adapt, and innovate is [[**crucial** to
ensure]{.mark} the **[continuity]{.mark}** and [**success** of **U.S.**
**agriculture**]{.mark} in an increasingly dynamic and challenging
global market environment.]{.underline}

### AT: Democracy

#### China's expansion in Panama does not impact democracy, it is resilient

**Doorenspleet** 20**19**

\[Renske Doorenspleet, Politics Professor at the University of Warwick,
"Rethinking the Value of Democracy: A Comparative Perspective", Palgrave
Macmillan, p. 239-243\]

[The value of democracy has been **taken for granted**]{.underline}
until recently, but this assumption seems to be under threat now more
than ever before. As was explained in Chapter 1, democracy's claim to be
valuable does not rest on just one particular merit, and scholars tend
to distinguish three different types of values (Sen 1999). This book
focused on the instrumental value of democracy (and hence not on the
intrinsic and constructive value), and investigated the value of
democracy for peace (Chapters 3 and 4), control of corruption (Chapter
5) and economic development (Chapter 6). [[This study]{.mark} was based
on a [search]{.mark} of **[a]{.mark}n enormous academic
[database]{.mark}**]{.underline} for certain keywords,6 [then
[pruned]{.mark} **the [thousands of articles]{.mark}**]{.underline} down
to a few hundred articles (see Appendix) [[which]{.mark} **statistically
[analysed]{.mark}** the connection between the [democracy]{.mark} and
the four expected outcomes]{.underline}. The frst fiding is that
[**[a]{.mark} reverse [wave away]{.mark} from democracy** [has not
happened]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Chapter 2). Not yet, at least.
[Democracy is not doing worse than before]{.underline}, at least not [in
comparative perspective]{.underline}. While it is true that there is a
dramatic decline in democracy in some countries,7 [a general trend
downwards cannot yet be detected]{.underline}. It would be better to
talk about 'stagnation', as not many dictatorships have democratized
recently, while democracies have not yet collapsed. Another fnding is
that the instrumental value of democracy is very questionable. The feld
has been deeply polarized between researchers who endorse a link between
democracy and positive outcomes, and those who reject this optimistic
idea and instead emphasize the negative effects of democracy. [There has
been [**'no consensus'** in]{.mark} **the quantitative
[literature]{.mark}** on whether democracy has]{.underline} instrumental
value which leads some [**beneficial general outcomes**. Some scholars
claim there is a consensus, but they only do so by ignoring **a huge
amount of literature** which rejects their own point of
view]{.underline}. After undertaking a large-scale analysis of carefully
selected articles published on the topic (see Appendix), [this book can
conclude that the connections between democracy and expected [benefts
are]{.mark} **not**]{.underline} as **[strong]{.underline}** as they
seem. Hence, we should not overstate the links between the phenomena.
[**The overall evidence** is **[weak]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Take the
expected impact of democracy on peace for example. As Chapter 3 showed,
the study of democracy and interstate war has been a fourishing theme in
political science, particularly since the 1970s. However, there are four
reasons why democracy does not cause peace between countries, and why
the empirical support for the popular idea of democratic peace is quite
weak. [**Most statistical [studies]{.mark}** [have not found
**a**]{.mark} **strong [correlation]{.mark}** [between democracy
and]{.mark} **interstate [war]{.mark}** [at **the dyadic**]{.mark}
**level**]{.underline}. They show that [[there are]{.mark}
other---[**more powerful**---explanations]{.mark} for war]{.underline}
and peace, and even that [the impact of [democracy is]{.mark} **a
[spurious]{.mark} one**]{.underline} (caveat 1). Moreover, [the
theoretical foundation of the democratic peace hypothesis is
**weak**]{.underline}, and [the [causal mechanisms are
**unclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} (caveat 2). In addition, [democracies
are not]{.underline} necessarily **[more peaceful in
general]{.underline}**, and [the evidence]{.underline} for the
democratic peace hypothesis [at **the monadic level** is
**inconclusive**]{.underline} (caveat 3). Finally, the process of
[democratization is **dangerous**]{.underline}. Living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country (caveat
4). With regard to peace between countries, we cannot defend the idea
that democracy has instrumental value. [Can the]{.underline}
(instrumental) [value]{.underline} of democracy [be found in the
prevention of civil war?]{.underline} Or is the evidence for the
opposite idea more convincing, and does democracy have a 'dark side'
which makes civil war more likely? The findings are confusing, which is
exacerbated by the fact that different aspects of civil war (prevalence,
onset, duration and severity) are mixed up in some civil war studies.
Moreover, defining civil war is a delicate, politically sensitive issue.
Determining whether there is a civil war in a particular country is
incredibly diffcult, while measurements suffer from many weaknesses
(caveat 1). Moreover, [there is **no linear link**: [civil wars are
**just as unlikely** in democracies]{.mark} as in
dictatorships]{.underline} (caveat 2). Civil war is most likely in times
of political change. [[Democratization]{.mark} is **a very
[unpredictable]{.mark}**[, **dangerous**]{.mark} **process**, increasing
the chance of civil war significantly]{.underline}. Hybrid systems are
at risk as well: the chance of civil war is much higher compared to
other political systems (caveat 3). More specifcally, both the strength
and type of political institutions matter when explaining civil war.
However, [the type of political system (e.g. democracy or dictatorship)
is **not the decisive factor at all**]{.underline} (caveat 4). Finally,
democracy has only limited explanatory power (caveat 5). [Economic
factors are far more significant than political factors]{.underline}
(such as having a democratic system) when explaining the onset, duration
and severity of civil war. To prevent civil war, it would make more
sense to make poorer countries richer, instead of promoting democracy.
[Helping countries]{.underline} to [democratize would **even be a very
dangerous idea**]{.underline}, as countries with changing levels of
democracy are most vulnerable, making civil wars most likely. It is true
that there is evidence that the chance of civil war decreases when the
extent of democracy increases considerably. The problem however is that
most countries do not go through big political changes but through small
changes instead; those small steps---away or towards more
democracy---are dangerous. Not only is the onset of civil war likely
under such circumstances, but civil wars also tend to be longer, and the
confict is more cruel leading to more victims, destruction and killings
(see Chapter 4). A more encouraging story can be told around the value
for democracy to control corruption in a country (see Chapter 5).
Fighting corruption has been high on the agenda of international
organizations such as the World Bank and the IMF. Moreover, the theme of
corruption has been studied thoroughly in many different academic
disciplines---mainly in economics, but also in sociology, political
science and law. Democracy has often been suggested as one of the
remedies when fghting against high levels of continuous corruption. So
far, the statistical evidence has strongly supported this idea. As
Chapter 5 showed, dozens of studies with broad quantitative,
cross-national and comparative research have found statistically
signifcant associations between (less) democracy and (more) corruption.
However, there are vast problems around conceptualization (caveat 1) and
measurement (caveat 2) of 'corruption'. Another caveat is that
[[democratizing countries are]{.mark} **the [poor]{.mark}est
performers** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} regard to [controlling
[corruption]{.mark}]{.underline} (caveat 3). Moreover, it is not
democracy in general, but particular political institutions which have
an impact on the control of corruption; and a free press also helps a
lot in order to limit corruptive practices in a country (caveat 4). In
addition, democracies seem to be less affected by corruption than
dictatorships, but at the same time, there is clear evidence that
economic factors have more explanatory power (caveat 5). In conclusion,
more democracy means less corruption, but we need to be modest (as other
factors matter more) and cautious (as there are many caveats). The
perceived impact of democracy on development has been highly contested
as well (see Chapter 6). Some scholars argue that democratic systems
have a positive impact, while others argue that high levels of democracy
actually reduce the levels of economic growth and development.
Particularly since the 1990s, statistical studies have focused on this
debate, and [the empirical evidence is **clear**: there is **[no]{.mark}
direct [impact]{.mark}** [of democracy on]{.mark}
development]{.underline}. Hence, both approaches cannot be supported
(see caveat 1). The indirect impact via other factors is also
questionable (caveat 2). Moreover, [there is **too much variation**
in]{.underline} levels of economic [[growth]{.underline}]{.mark} and
development [among the dictatorial systems]{.underline}, and there are
huge regional differences (caveat 3). Adopting a one-size-ftsall
approach would not be wise at all. In addition, in order to increase
development, it would be better to focus on alternative factors such as
improving institutional quality and good governance (caveat 4). There is
not suffcient evidence to state that democracy has instrumental value,
at least not with regard to economic growth. However, future research
needs to include broader concepts and measurements of development in
their models, as so far studies have mainly focused on explaining
cross-national differences in growth of GDP (caveat 5). Overall, [**the
instrumental [value]{.mark} of democracy** [is]{.mark}]{.underline}---at
best---tentative, or---if being less mild---[**simply
[non-existent]{.mark}**[. Democracy is **not**]{.mark} **necessarily
[better]{.mark}** than **any alternative form of government**.
[With]{.mark}]{.underline} regard to [many]{.underline} of the expected
[benefts---such as less [war]{.mark}, less [corruption]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} more economic [development]{.mark}---democracy **does
deliver, but so do nondemocratic systems**]{.underline}. High or low
levels of democracy do not make a distinctive difference. Mid-range
democracy levels do matter though. Hybrid systems can be associated with
many negative outcomes, while this is also the case for democratizing
countries. Moreover, other explanations---typically certain favourable
economic factors in a country---are much more powerful to explain the
expected benefts, at least compared to the single fact that a country is
a democracy or not. The impact of democracy fades away in the powerful
shadows of the economic factors.8

Ambassador Jorge Heine, research **[professor]{.underline}** at the
Pardee School appeared on a recent episode of The Newsmakers, TRT
World's flagship show --- to discuss [[**China**'s growing **influence**
in **Latin America**]{.mark}. The ambassador elaborated on why China, in
spite of being the United States biggest rival, has [emerged to be an
indispensable **ally**]{.mark} for Latin America.]{.underline}

Ambassador Jorge Heine.

When asked about Latin America's burgeoning dynamic with China, Heine
remarked that it signifies a major shift in the region's history. This
is because for almost two centuries of Latin America's independence,
most of its diplomatic, financial, trade, and investment relations were
primarily associated with two key players: Europe and the U.S. But that
isn't the case anymore.

"Trade between China and Latin America in the year 2000 was around \$12
billion," said Heine. "Last year, it was \$516 billion. So a 40-time
increase in, you know, a little over 20 years. What does that mean? That
[[for **South America**]{.mark} today, the [number one trading
**partner**]{.mark} is no longer the U.S. It's no longer Europe. It [is
**China**]{.mark}. That marks a very important difference, and as a
rule, it is [better to have more partners rather than fewer
ones]{.mark}.]{.underline}

["[I would say that]{.mark} all in all, [**big picture**, it's a
**good** thing to have China in the region." --- Ambassador Jorge
Heine]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The Latin American **economy** has to deal with]{.mark} the
[**strain** caused by]{.mark} the [ongoing mass **deportations** while
it still reels from]{.mark} the [substantial **losses** suffered during
the pandemic]{.mark}. Heine believes that the [trade and **investment**
from China]{.mark} [can significantly aid the region's
**recovery**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The professor also reminded viewers of the joint [statement issued by
President Boric of [**Chile** and]{.mark} President Lula of
**[Brazil]{.mark}** emphasizing that they [want to do business with both
China and the U.S.]{.mark}, [instead of]{.mark} being coerced to [choose
between the two.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["[Latin American countries]{.mark} are independent nations. They [have
their own **sovereignty**]{.mark} and they make their own decisions."
--- Ambassador Jorge Heine]{.underline}

[[When asked if the **U.S.** should feel **endangered** by China's
presence]{.mark} in Latin America, [Heine **disagreed** and suggested an
**alternative**]{.mark} to deal with the new world order. He said that
[the States should focus on]{.mark} offering concrete
**[incentives]{.mark}** to the region [instead of **retaliating** with
sanctions that may **jeopardize** the **U.S.**-**L**]{.mark}atin

#### China promotes peaceful coexistence through soft power\-\--its "Harmonious World" policy rejects coercion and embraces cultural diplomacy, not authoritarian expansion.

[[Soft power diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} encompasses politics,
culture, economics, cultural exchange and [[is strengthened by]{.mark}
the [Chinese diaspora]{.mark}]{.underline}, whose strengthening of
cultural and economic ties is reinforced by Chinese government policy.
Beijing coupled soft power---influencing others' behaviour through these
realms---with the agent strategic thinking of Sun Tzu to project a
positive image of Chinese foreign policy and ultimately force the enemy
to surrender without bloodshed.

In 2004, Hu Jintao assumed power in [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, soon
after introducing soft power to PRC discourse and, in fact, equating its
importance to that of economic and military power. Chinese diplomats
[[adopted]{.mark} this [change]{.mark}, [protecting an attractive and
friendly image]{.mark}]{.underline} to the world to disarm fears of PRC
predation and dominance.

[[China's]{.mark} 'Harmonious Society' policy, now applied to
internationally as the ['Harmonious World' policy, is based on Confucian
doctrine and consists of]{.mark} five elements: (1) [a win-win
strategy]{.mark}, (2) [peaceful development]{.mark}, (3) [respect for
diversity]{.mark}, (4) [cooperation]{.mark} and coordination,
[and]{.mark} (5) [peaceful coexistence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Hu-supported Chinese academics and specialists developed the theory of
'ascent' or 'peaceful development', which represents Herrera,
Montenegro, Alden, Mendez, Torres-[Lista [China]{.mark} as [a
non-threatening emerging power that seeks not to challenge the status
quo, but to construct a 'harmonious world']{.mark} in which its
development is [linked by winwin opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Miranda Z, 2016). This image seeks to remove fear and advance political
goals.

Moreover, Chinese culture is ancient, complex, and captivating, and its
promotion has become a fundamental soft power tool. An example is
language, disseminated through the Confucius Institutes, which aim to
promote the Mandarin language, Chinese culture, and the facilitation of
cultural exchanges.

Politicized initiatives like DEI always spawn enormous bureaucracies

not immune. A report on the Navy compiled for members of Congress
observes that, today, \"non-combat curricula consume Navy resources,
clog inboxes, create administrative quagmires, and monopolize precious
training time.\"

Biden's DOD sometimes seems more interested in culture-war activism than
combat training and lethality. The Pentagon now pays for abortion travel
expenses, on-base pride celebrations, and drag queen story hours.

Their 2023 budget requested \$34.2 million to conduct a witch hunt for
\"extremist\"---which in Biden-world translates as

#### China avoids confrontation with the U.S. in Latin America\-\--Beijing deliberately limits its presence to preserve U.S. hegemony and prevent geopolitical fallout.

Another factor that both [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} authors in this
volume [[stress]{.underline}]{.mark} is China\'s perceived [[need to
avoid alienating]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the course of expanding its
relations with [[Latin America]{.underline}]{.mark}. Xiang states that
\"official rhetoric aside, there is no doubt that Beijing\'s decision at
the end of the twentieth century to intensify its engagement with Latin
America was largely motivated by the pressing issue of energy security
\.... Yet an important foreign policy dilemma arises from China\'s new
interest in Latin America: simply put, relations with the United States
\.... Clearly, the current [[regime\'s main concern]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the [Western Hemisphere [is to avoid any geopolitical consequences

Jiang, taking a more official stance, states that \"[China is well aware
of the fact that the United States considers Latin America its backyard,
and]{.underline} [[China has no intention of challenging U.S.
hegemony]{.mark} [in the region]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

One of the issues with respect to the United States, as mentioned
earlier, is China\'s reliance on U.S. investment and investment by U.S.
allies, especially Japan. More generally, however[, [China is well aware
that]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [remains much more
powerful]{.mark} in both economic and military terms, [so it
wants]{.mark} [to avoid]{.mark}]{.underline} direct
[[confrontations]{.underline}]{.mark}. This had led the [[Chinese

#### **Presence is [exclusively]{.underline} economic\-\--presence [doesn't]{.underline} mean influence.**

**Yuan '25** \[Shawn; 1/22/25; Senior Journalist at BBC, former Research
Fellow at the Human Rights Watch; BBC, "Does China \'operate\' Panama
Canal, as Trump says?" https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1km4vj3pl0o\]

On Christmas Day, [[Trump posted]{.underline}]{.mark} on social media
that the \"[wonderful [soldiers of China\" were]{.mark} \"lovingly, but
illegally, **[operating]{.mark}** the [Panama]{.mark} Canal\" - a claim
[which was swiftly **denied**]{.mark} by officials [in
**Panama**]{.mark} City [and **Beijing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At the time, [Panamanian President]{.underline} José Raúl [[Mulino
described]{.mark} the [claim as \"**nonsense**\",
stressing]{.mark}]{.underline} that [there was \"[**absolutely** no
Chinese interference]{.mark}\"]{.underline} in the canal.

Trump has also threatened to take the canal back by force, citing
\"exorbitant\" fees being allegedly charged for US vessels to pass
through it - another claim rejected by Panamanian authorities.

Following Trump\'s inauguration address, President Mulino again stressed
that there was \"no presence of any nation in the world that interferes
with our administration\" of the Panama Canal.

[[The **strategic** waterway]{.underline}]{.mark}, which handles about
5% of global maritime trade volume, [[is operated by the Panama Canal
Authority]{.underline}]{.mark}, an agency of the Panamanian government,
[[not Chinese soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, Mr Trump\'s inaccurate claim reflects the concerns of some US
officials over China\'s significant investments in the canal and its
surrounding infrastructure.

What is the history of Panama Canal?

Historically, the US played a pivotal role in the construction and
administration of the passage, which links the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans.

After a failed attempt by the French to build it, the US secured the
rights to undertake the project. The canal\'s construction was completed
in 1914.

It remained under US control until 1977, when then President Jimmy
Carter signed a treaty to gradually hand it over to Panama, which Trump
has referred to as \"foolish\".

Since 1999, the Panama Canal Authority has held exclusive control over
the operations of the waterway.

The treaties signed by both the US and Panama stipulated that it shall
remain permanently neutral, but the US reserves the right to defend any
threat to the canal\'s neutrality using military force under this deal.

What is China\'s role in the operations of the canal?

[[There is no]{.mark} public [ev]{.mark}idence [to
suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [Chinese gov]{.mark}ernment
[exercises **control**]{.mark} over the canal, or its
military]{.underline}. However, Chinese companies have a significant
presence there.

From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the
cargo volume transiting the Panama Canal, making it the second-largest
user after the US.

In recent years, China has also invested heavily in ports and terminals
near the canal.

Two of the five ports adjacent to the canal, Balboa and Cristóbal, which
sit on the Pacific and Atlantic sides respectively, have been operated
by a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings since 1997.

The company is a subsidiary of the publicly listed CK
[[Hutchison]{.underline}]{.mark} Holdings, a Hong Kong-based
conglomerate founded by Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing.

It has port operations in 24 countries, including the UK.

Although it [[is not **state-owned** by China]{.underline}]{.mark}, says
Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Centre for Strategic
and International Studies, there have been concerns in Washington over
how much control Beijing would be able to exert over the company.

A wealth of potentially useful strategic information on ships passing
through the waterway flows through these ports.

\"There is an increasing geopolitical tension of economic nature between
the US and China,\" Mr Berg says. \"That kind of information regarding
cargo would be very useful in the event of a supply chain war.\"

CK Hutchison did not respond to the BBC\'s request for comment.

The bids to operate those ports faced almost no competition, according
to Andrew Thomas, a professor at the University of Akron who has written
a book on the canal. \"The US at the time didn\'t really care about
these ports and Hutchison faced no objection,\" he says.

Chinese companies, both private and state-owned, have also strengthened
their presence in Panama through billions of dollars in investments,
including a cruise terminal and a bridge to be built over the canal.

This \"[**package** of [Chinese activities]{.mark}]{.underline}\", as
described by Mr Thomas, [[might have **prompted** Trump\'s
assertion]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the canal is \"owned\" by China,
[but **operation**]{.mark} of those ports [does not equate to
**ownership**]{.mark}]{.underline}, he stresses.

[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[**repeatedly**
said]{.underline}]{.mark} that [China\'s [ties]{.mark} with Latin
America [are characterised by \"**equality**, **mutual benefit**,
**innovation**, **openness** and]{.mark} benefits for [the
people]{.mark}\".]{.underline}

### AT: China Rise

#### China's rise in Latin America is framed around peaceful development promoting dialogue, sovereignty, and cooperative security instead of military expansion.

[President [Xi announced]{.mark} the [Global Security Initiative]{.mark}
(GSI)]{.underline} during the Boao Forum for Asia. It aims [[to address
global security challenges by promoting]{.mark} a vision of common,
comprehensive, [cooperative]{.mark}, and sustainable
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[GSI]{.underline}]{.mark}, along
with the Global Development and Global Civilization Initiatives, are
strategic frameworks to [[promote development]{.mark}, security, [and
cultural cooperation globally.]{.mark}]{.underline} These initiatives
are essentially "umbrella terms" that [[encompass]{.underline}]{.mark}
existing Chinese foreign policy objectives and projects, providing an
ideological counterweight to supplement the BRI. The GSI outlines six
commitments:

(1[) Common, comprehensive, [cooperative]{.mark}, and sustainable
[security]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[(2) [Respect for the sovereignty]{.mark} and territorial integrity [of
all countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[(3) [Adherence to]{.mark} the purposes and principles of the
[UN]{.mark} Charter.]{.underline}

[(4) [Consideration of]{.mark}]{.underline} the legitimate security
[[concerns of all nations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

(5[) [Peaceful resolution]{.mark} of disputes [through dialogue]{.mark}
and consultation]{.underline}.

\(6\) [Security maintenance in both traditional [and]{.mark}
non-traditional domains]{.underline}.

In practice, the GSI encompasses various activities, including
international policing cooperation, [[conflict
mediation]{.underline}]{.mark}, and security training programs. For
instance, China has announced plans to train thousands of foreign law
enforcement officers and send police consultants to countries in need.

To date, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and some [[Caribbean
countries]{.mark} have [expressed support for GSI]{.mark}]{.underline},
often through participation in multilateral forums like the CELAC Forum.

#### China's only seeks multilateral collaboration

What Extent is China Challenging US's Hegemony?", 2025,
https://www.allazimuth.com/2025/02/25/the-hegemonic-transition-in-latin-america-to-what-extent-is-china-challenging-uss-hegemony/,

Some of [[China's multilat]{.mark}eral [initiatives]{.mark} are
[complement]{.mark}ary to the institutional [s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark},]{.underline} whereas others are indicative of deeper
conflicts over fundamental principles. Both China and the US consider
that their proposal is fair and legitimate, and the PRC is ready to show
its regained influence in the international arena. We conclude that the
[PRC]{.underline} has reached a [power]{.underline} status that has
enabled it to create a new system of rules, [[different from]{.mark} the
one imposed by the [hegemonic state]{.mark}.]{.underline} This new
proposal has attracted several LA countries, becoming a relevant
challenge for the current hegemon. However[, [the]{.mark} new system [is
far from being the prevailing one]{.mark}]{.underline}. China's
influence is not the same all over the region, partly because the PRC
has divided LA countries according to its strategic
interests.[\[cvii\]](https://www.allazimuth.com/2025/02/25/the-hegemonic-transition-in-latin-america-to-what-extent-is-china-challenging-uss-hegemony/#_edn107) In
consequence, [[even]{.mark} [without]{.mark} a strong [US
lead]{.mark}ership, Bretton Woods institutions and [the liberal world
order could
survive]{.mark}.]{.underline}[[\[cviii\]]{.underline}](https://www.allazimuth.com/2025/02/25/the-hegemonic-transition-in-latin-america-to-what-extent-is-china-challenging-uss-hegemony/#_edn108)

The second condition to become the hegemon is to show the will to reach
this status. Throughout history[, China's leaders have declared that
[the PRC does not seek hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline} On April 9, 1974,
the Vice Premier of China, Deng Xiaoping, led a Chinese delegation to
the Sixth Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly and
delivered a speech to state clearly to the world that ["China is not a
superpower, nor will she ever seek to be
one]{.underline}."[\[cix\]](https://www.allazimuth.com/2025/02/25/the-hegemonic-transition-in-latin-america-to-what-extent-is-china-challenging-uss-hegemony/#_edn109) More
recently, on December 1, 2017, [President Xi Jinping reiterated China's
commitment to never seeking hegemony, vowing that the PRC will not
develop [at the expense of other nations]{.mark}, but warning that they
would not be told what to do by
anyone]{.underline}.[\[cx\]](https://www.allazimuth.com/2025/02/25/the-hegemonic-transition-in-latin-america-to-what-extent-is-china-challenging-uss-hegemony/#_edn110) In
this regard, it is essential to underline [that China's external policy
is]{.underline} guided by the essential principle of
["[non-interference" in partner countries' domestic
issues.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Creating a new kind of [international leadership built upon]{.mark}
clearly different values[,]{.mark} the Beijing Consensus [is]{.mark}
[one]{.mark} of the Chinese government's main
[objective]{.mark}s.]{.underline} Until now, the PRC policy has
developed a set of instruments in terms of "hard" and "soft" power that
are depleting US hegemony, but we have not found relevant signals
indicating the will to become the new hegemonic state in LA, neither in
China's official statements, nor in the PCR's governmental decisions[.
Instead, the idea of a new [multipolar system]{.mark} [has]{.mark}
[been]{.mark} widely [defended]{.mark} by Chinese
authorities.]{.underline} Admittedly, the PRC faces a credibility
problem[\[cxi\]](https://www.allazimuth.com/2025/02/25/the-hegemonic-transition-in-latin-america-to-what-extent-is-china-challenging-uss-hegemony/#_edn111) deeply
rooted in Western powers, but this issue is not sufficient to defend
that China is hiding a wish to become the new hegemon.

Finally[, the third condition to becoming a hegemonic state is the
commitment to a system perceived as mutually beneficial to major
states]{.underline}. Whereas [several LA countries have signed WTO+
agreements with China]{.underline}, some of [the biggest
economies]{.underline} (e.g., Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico), [have
preferred to protect themselves from the PRC]{.underline}, adopting
protectionist policies. Certainly, China continues to strengthen its
network of alliances step by step. In February 2022, Argentina decided
to become a member of the BRI, and in May 2023, China and Ecuador signed
an FTA. In this regard, [LA economies that suffered more strikes and
government crises during IMF programs are more likely to look to China
for
leadership]{.underline}.[\[cxii\]](https://www.allazimuth.com/2025/02/25/the-hegemonic-transition-in-latin-america-to-what-extent-is-china-challenging-uss-hegemony/#_edn112) However,
despite this progress[, [the PRC has not]{.mark} yet
[implemented]{.mark} [an]{.mark} [alternative]{.mark} [system]{.mark}
all across the region.]{.underline}

#### No China rise \-- inter-dependence and fear of US backlash

Robert Evan **Ellis 11**, Research Professor of Latin American Studies
at the U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, PhD in
Political Science, "The Strategic Dimension of Chinese Engagement with
Latin America," *William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense
Studies*, National Defense University, 2011,
<https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=aWyP8-fXlsYC>

Another factor that both Chinese authors in this volume stress is
China\'s perceived need to avoid alienating the United States in the
course of expanding its relations with Latin America. Xiang states that
\"official rhetoric aside, there is no doubt that Beijing\'s decision at
the end of the twentieth century to intensify its engagement with Latin
America was largely motivated by the pressing issue of energy security
\.... Yet an important foreign policy dilemma arises from China\'s new
interest in Latin America: simply put, relations with the United States
\.... Clearly, [the current regime\'s main concern in the Western
Hemisphere is to avoid any geopolitical consequences resulting from its
expansion into Latin America]{.underline}.\" Jiang, taking a more
official stance, states that \"China is well aware of the fact that the
United States considers Latin America its backyard, and [China has no
intention of challenging U.S. hegemony in the region.\"]{.underline}

[One of the issues with respect to the United States]{.underline}, as
mentioned earlier, [is China\'s reliance on U.S. investment and
investment by U.S. allies]{.underline}, especially Japan. More
generally, however, China is well aware that the United States remains
much more powerful in both economic and military terms, so [it wants to
avoid direct confrontations. This had led the Chinese government to try
to keep a low profile, especially in areas of long-standing importance
to the United States]{.underline}. In this light, overtures such as
those of Hugo Chávez are especially problematic. China does not want to
be perceived as taking sides with groups in Latin America (or elsewhere)
that are openly anti-American.

#### China\'s policy shift disproves revisionism, China prioritizes economic growth and cooperation.

**Chen, C.-K. (2021).** Department of International Studies, Rhodes
College, Memphis, TN, USA. **China in Latin America Then and Now: A
Systemic Constructivist Analysis of China's Foreign Policy. Journal of
Current Chinese Affairs, 50(2),
111-136. <https://doi.org/10.1177/18681026211034880> (Original work
published 2021)**

[By [examining China's policy towards Latin
America]{.mark}]{.underline}, this article [shows]{.mark} that, although
the guiding doctrine of China's policy towards Latin America has never
changed since the establishment of the Chinese communist regime in 1949
(i.e. "South--South Cooperation" on the basis of the "Five Principle of
Peaceful Coexistence"), [[its **policy** goal towards the region today
is actually much **less revisionist** than it was
before]{.underline}]{.mark}. This phenomenon seems to be inconsistent
with the "China threat" argument which, referring to the power
transition theory (Kugler and Organski, 1989), claims that China (as a
dissatisfied rising power) is inclined to challenge the US (as the
dominant power in our world) and overthrow the US-dominated
international order when the gap between their power narrows. There is
no doubt that China is still not very satisfied with the existing
international system dominated by the US, as well as its status in it.
Also, with its growing power, China does have a potential to challenge
the US-led status quo. [That being said, while still dissatisfied, China
is actually much less revisionist now than it was before [the late
1970s]{.mark}]{.underline} despite the fact that its power has been
significantly growing since then. More specifically, while China before
the late 1970s prioritised using its power to overthrow the
international system dominated by the hegemonic US and Soviet Union, it
has [since the late 1970s [been prioritising using its growing power to
pursue domestic **economic development** over challenging the
US]{.mark}]{.underline} even though it is still not completely satisfied
with the existing US-dominated international order. Through a "systemic
constructivist" lens, this article demonstrates that the [change of the
interactions between China and other countries (especially the dominant
and major powers), from isolation and confrontation to engagement and
interdependence]{.underline}, has changed China's perceptions about the
nature of the international system, as well as its identity and
interests in the system, [which in turn has [**changed** China's policy
**goal**]{.mark} towards Latin America (and the "Global South" in
general) from a very revolutionary and politically focused one [to a
less revisionist and economically focused one]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[reintroduction]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Monroe]{.underline}]{.mark} [Doctrine]{.underline} [into U.S. policy
toward Latin America must be [observed]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
[scepticism]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the circumstances that have ensured
its effectiveness in the past, especially in the Cold War period, no
longer exist. On the one hand, the [United States no longer has the
conditions of yore, as most major international issues cannot be
resolved unilaterally.]{.underline} Similarly, [[due]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the [technological]{.mark} [revolution]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[China's]{.mark} [emergence]{.mark} as a staunch competitor]{.underline}
in the digital economy, the [[U.S.' ability]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[sustain]{.mark} productivity [gains]{.mark}, [job]{.mark}
[creation]{.mark} [and]{.mark} even the socalled "[American]{.mark}
[Dream]{.mark}" is [no]{.mark} [longer]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[same]{.mark} as in the "Golden Age]{.underline}." This does not mean
that any other state can at this moment cast a shadow over the United
States, as the country still has a strong system of innovation, enormous
military capability, and a worldwide soft power network. [Another
important issue to consider is that [this]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} a [competition]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [two]{.mark}
antagonistic economic [models]{.mark}, as it was throughout the Cold
War.]{.underline} The [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}
[China]{.mark} [are]{.mark} intrinsically [linked]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[interdependent]{.mark} in international productive, trade and financial
flows]{.underline}. As much as the Trump administration tries to block
the Chinese economic and technological rise[, it is [impossible]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [create]{.mark} a "[sanitary cordon]{.mark}" around
i]{.underline}t, [as]{.mark} [the degree of [economic]{.mark}
[integratio]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark} and interdependence between
the countries [[makes]{.mark} such a [measure]{.mark}
[impossibl]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}. [[Attempts]{.mark} by the
United States [to]{.mark} [block]{.mark} [Chine]{.mark}se
initiati]{.underline}ves such as the AIIB and the BRI [have [not]{.mark}
[found]{.mark} [support]{.mark}]{.underline} from traditional partners
such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom, which in fact were
founders of AIIB. The current attempt to pressure allied countries not
to incorporate 5G Internet technology into their communication systems
is having limited effect. Finally, [[when]{.mark} [it]{.mark}
[comes]{.mark} [to Latin America]{.mark}n and Caribbean countries, it is
[difficult]{.mark} [to]{.mark} totally [realign]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[region]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [U.S. interests]{.mark} [as]{.mark} the
degree of [interrelations]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [China]{.mark} has
[reached]{.mark} a very [high]{.mark} [level]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Bolsonaro government of [[Brazil]{.mark} is a [good]{.mark}
[example]{.mark}. [While]{.mark} [sustaining]{.mark} an openly
[pro]{.mark}-[U.S.]{.mark} [stance]{.mark} and being critical of China
during the election campaign, the Brazilian [government]{.mark} is
[adopting]{.mark} a [neutral]{.mark} [stance]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
Sino-U.S. [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this sense, pragmatism and
the desire not to embarrass the country's main trading partner is more
important than ideological breakthroughs which still persist in certain
government sectors, notably in the ministry of foreign affairs[. [This
logic is valid]{.mark} for countries with governments aligned to the
right of the political spectrum, [such]{.mark} as [Chile, Argentina,
Peru and Colombi]{.mark}a]{.underline}. Due to the characteristics of
export tariffs based on agricultural and mineral commodities, the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates would [not]{.mark} be [able]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [supplant]{.mark} [Chinese]{.mark} [demand]{.mark} as they
are in many cases competing in the international market]{.underline}.
Therefore, in the face of disputes between two important partners,
[[prudence indicates that neutrality is the best way forward for Latin
American and Caribbean countries.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## China Revisionism

### Offensive Realism\-\--2AC

#### China's an offensive realist.

Rivalry,"

rohan

Mearsheimer's **[[offensive realism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[argues]{.underline} that [great [powers]{.mark}]{.underline} are
[[**inherently** driven to seek **dominance**]{.underline}]{.mark} in an
anarchic international system [[to]{.mark} [secure]{.mark}]{.underline}
their **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This perspective sees
conflict between rising and established powers as inevitable; a
[framework]{.underline} often [applied]{.underline} to the US-China
rivalry. In the United States, his work has informed debates on issues
like NATO expansion, the containment of [China]{.underline}, and
military intervention.

Despite the acceptance of his ideas in China, Mearsheimer has faced
growing marginalisation in American academia, where progressive ideals
emphasising multilateralism and liberal values dominate. His critiques
of military overreach and skepticism toward international institutions
contrast with the prevailing norms. Nonetheless, elements of his
thought, such as his critique of NATO's role in provoking Russia or his
call for restraint in military engagements, have subtly shaped US policy
discussions.

Why Mearsheimer Resonates in China

[Mearsheimer's [theories **align** with China's]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**historical narrative** of the "**[Century of
Humiliation]{.mark}**"]{.underline}, marked by [imperialist]{.underline}
[[invasions]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}. This period [fostered a **[deep
skepticism]{.mark}**]{.underline} of international cooperation and
reinforced a realist worldview focused on power and survival.
Mearsheimer's acknowledgement of US intentions to contain [[China's rise
aligns with **Chinese perspectives**]{.underline}]{.mark}, providing
what many see as a rare moment of honesty from an American scholar.

Culturally, Mearsheimer's steadfast defence of [offensive [realism
**resonates** with Chinese values]{.mark}]{.underline}. In traditional
narratives like The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, characters who
[exhibit [**loyalty** and **strategic
consistency**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even when opposed to the mainstream,
are admired. Mearsheimer's intellectual integrity and [unyielding
**commitment**]{.underline} to his views, despite criticism in the US,
fit this archetype. For many in China, he exemplifies the kind of
principled thinker who transcends national boundaries.

The [Chinese government]{.underline} tacitly encourages Mearsheimer's
popularity. His critiques of US foreign policy and [emphasis
on]{.underline} the inevitability of **[conflict]{.underline}** between
great powers [[align with Beijing's narrative of **Western
aggression**]{.underline}]{.mark} against China. By amplifying voices
like Mearsheimer's, the government reinforces its strategic messaging
while maintaining control over domestic academic discourse. Ironically,
his presence highlights the restrictions Chinese scholars face when
engaging with similar critical topics.

### Revisionist

#### China's revisionist.

**Kuczynski et al. '24** \[Emilia; 2024; President of the Strategic
Studies Students Consortium (S3C), Centre for Military, Security and
Strategic Studies; JMSS, "THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL STRATEGIES OF CHINESE
REVISIONISM: IMPLICATIONS FOR NATO," Nato Field School, Volume 23, Issue
4, https://jmss.org/article/view/80167/57983\] rohan

**[[Revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a concept of international
relations theory which [attempts to [understand]{.mark}]{.underline} the
issue of dissatisfied states and [political change within world
politics]{.underline}.9 It is based upon the [[existence of a **dominant
world order**]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that is accepted and
[**strengthened** by some]{.underline} and is [rejected]{.underline} and
[**weakened** by others]{.underline}.10 A world order or status quo can
be understood as "a social order composed of a power and status
relationship between states and a set of norms and rules that help
constitute and legitimate the order."11 Therefore, revisionism can be
understood as a means for the characterization of revisionist and status
quo-defending powers based on how a state's interests align with the
existing world order.12 [A state characterized as
**revisionist**]{.underline} is assumed to be [adopting a particular
**positionality** towards the **status quo**]{.underline}, expressing a
sense of dissatisfaction.13

While there is agreement within the literature on the fundamental
meanings of revisionism in international relations, there is still
debate about what exactly makes a state revisionist.14 This analysis
will thus employ a distinction between two types of revisionism drawn
from Gilpin's15 works on revisionism, Ward's16 on revolutionary
revisionism, and Natalizia & Termine's17 analyses. These works
distinguish between incremental and revolutionary revisionism, a
distinction based on the strategies utilized by each type of
revisionist.18 In War and Change in World Politics, Gilpin introduces
these concepts as forms of political change.19 Incremental change,
according to Gilpin, is characterized by
"[[bargaining]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[coercive
**diplomacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [**[warfare]{.mark}** over
specific]{.underline} and relatively narrowly defined
[interests]{.underline}.\'\'20 Revolutionary change is encompassed by
the idea that a revisionist state may "believe that their interests can
be served only by more sweeping and more profound changes in the
international system."21 Incremental revisionism occurs below the
threshold of war and is gradual in nature, while revolutionary
[[revisionism can be]{.underline}]{.mark} much more
**[[catastrophic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, potentially resulting in a
hegemonic war.22 This analysis assumes [[China is an **incremental
revisionist**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The following section will then
examine [characteristic elements of the PRC's foreign]{.underline}
policy and strategies to [illustrate Chinese incremental
revisionism]{.underline}.

China as an Incremental and Coercive Revisionist

To demonstrate the incremental nature of Chinese revisionism, this
section will introduce the concept of [[coercion]{.underline}]{.mark} as
a characteristic [aspect of **Chinese revisionist**
strategies]{.underline}. Coercion is argued by scholars to be a notable
aspect of foreign policy that often shapes state interaction.23 Coercion
theory emerged initially in Thomas C. Schelling's Arms and Influence,
where he outlined coercion as an act intended to deter or compel a
target state.24 Coercion can be understood as "the power to hurt" which
confers "bargaining power."25 This notion of bargaining power is similar
to credibility, forcing the target state to decide both the credibility
of the coercive threat and whether it will resist or comply.26
Literature indicates four types of coercion: "**[[diplomatic]{.mark}
coercion]{.underline}**, [[economic]{.underline}]{.mark} sanctions,
**[[gray zone]{.mark} coercion]{.underline}** and [[military
coercion]{.underline}]{.mark}."27

Many scholars argue that China employs coercive tactics in its [[foreign
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}, ranging across the four types.28 In terms
of diplomatic coercion, China is noted to [utilize coercion to
[weaken]{.mark} **adversarial [partnerships]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one
example is China deepening its partnership with the Philippines to
challenge the US commitment to the nation.29Economic sanctions are a
type of coercion often utilized by China, as demonstrated by Zhang &
Shanks in their examination of the Chinese Economic Sanctions dataset.30
The PRC's use of economic sanctions indicates an increasingly aggressive
Chinese foreign policy.31 Gray zone coercion blurs the line between
military and non-military coercion while remaining just below the
threshold of war.32 This type of coercion is [enacted through
**[disinformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, foreign [[interference
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
[[cyber]{.mark}-[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}.33 Lastly, military
coercion is a display of military force or capabilities.34 China's
military [[build-up]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly [in the
**[maritime]{.mark}**]{.underline} domain, demonstrates a [clear
[display of **force** and **capability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.35
Coercion theory adds to the concept of incremental revisionism, allowing
for more insights into the tools utilized by revisionist states. This
focus on incremental revisionism, supplemented by coercion theory, will
allow for a comprehensive examination of the Chinese case and its
implications for NATO.

**[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategic [ambitions]{.underline} are
first and foremost regional. This is evident from Chinese
**[[territorial claims]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region, [military
developments]{.underline} to back these claims, and economic initiatives
to strengthen its influence and with this its [stance [as the **regional
hegemon**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, Chinese revisionism
has a global nature that cannot be overlooked; [[Increasing economic
interest abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example the Chinese
[**[B]{.mark}**elt and **[R]{.mark}**oad
**[I]{.mark}**nitiative]{.underline} (BRI), drives China's strategic
interests beyond its close region. China's [**[fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licies** are]{.underline} [[revisionist in
nature]{.underline}]{.mark} and [strive to [challenge the **world

China's [[economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[**[tech]{.mark}nological** advancements]{.underline} have laid the
[[foundation]{.underline}]{.mark} for its ability [[to exert
**power**]{.mark} [globally]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since 1978, GDP growth
has averaged over 9 percent annually.43 According to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), China has replaced the United States as the world's
largest economy since 2017.44 China's long-term economic plan includes
technological superiority and self-sufficiency. The "Made in China 2025
Plan" aims for 70 percent self-sufficiency in 10 high-tech areas.45
[China leads in several scientific fields]{.underline}, backed by
massive research spending, second only to the United States.46 [[China
has a]{.mark} **virtual [monopoly]{.mark}** [on **rare
minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline}, crucial for [[clean
**growth**]{.underline}]{.mark} and **[[defence
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. China accounted for 70 percent of
the world\'s rare earth mine production in 2022 and 89 percent of key
metals for electric vehicle (EV) magnets.47 With its export-oriented
growth, accounting for one-fifth of global exports of manufactured
goods, and low domestic consumption, China has amassed tremendous
savings, playing an [outsized [role in **global finances**]{.mark} and
[positioning itself for **broader influence**]{.mark}]{.underline}.48

China's [[revisionist **strategies** include]{.underline}]{.mark} the
use of **[[soft power]{.underline}]{.mark}** to reshape global
perceptions of the country. Tremendous economic growth and [deep global
[financial relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} are key elements. China
has surpassed the United States as the largest economy in the world. It
accounts for more than one-fifth of global exports of manufactured
goods. China has a virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, crucial for
clean growth and defense technologies. Providing [financial
**[support]{.mark}**]{.underline} to 165 [[**low** and **middle-income

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** claims it does not attach political
preconditions for aid and loans. However, scholars note the existence of
certain conditions that indeed [[demonstrate **hard
power**]{.underline}]{.mark} elements [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese
**[[financial support]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as adhering to the
[one-China principle]{.underline} and agreeing to use Chinese labour and
resources.52 Another example of a hard power flowing from a soft power
is [[China's ban]{.underline}]{.mark}, as of 21 December 2023,
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[export of]{.mark} rare earth mineral
**[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and separation
**[[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**,53 making it harder for other
countries to develop their sectors and hence support the conversion to
cleaner growth. China's ability to restrict access to rare earth
minerals or impose economic sanctions in response to political
disagreements demonstrates how [economic support]{.underline} can
[[transition into **hard power**]{.mark} tactics]{.underline}. By
fostering economic reliance, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} can [gradually
[escalate]{.mark} [from **persuasion** to
**coercion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much of the world has become
dependent upon China for [foreign assistance]{.underline}, debt
[funding]{.underline}, and [provision of rare minerals]{.underline}.

### Not Revisionist\-\--Deterrence Fails\-\--2NC

#### Attempts at power projection fails to deter China.

**Jackson '23** \[Van; January 16; Professor of International Relations

Security in Context; Foreign Affairs, "The Problem With Primacy,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/asia/problem-primacy\] rohan

For the United States, [there are [many **problems** with]{.mark} a
strategy]{.underline} based around [[trying to stop **China's
rise**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One is that on a basic level, **[[it will
not work]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is [[no reason to
believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that [spending over a [trillion]{.mark}
dollar[s]{.mark}]{.underline} modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal or
selling submarines to Australia [[will cause China to do
anything]{.underline} [but]{.underline}]{.mark} continue
[[arm]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[itself as **quickly**]{.underline} [as
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[spent
**years** preparing for]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[techno-containment]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategy from the United
States, launching its "Made in China 2025" initiative in 2015 precisely
to guarantee that it has a strong domestic technology industry. And the
rest of Asia is not willing or able to isolate Beijing under current
political conditions.

What [[maintaining]{.mark} U.S. [primacy]{.mark}]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} instead do is [[menace the **Asian
peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [massive military
investments]{.underline} needed to ensure the United States remains the
Indo-Pacific's dominant power [require]{.underline}
[**[outarming]{.underline}** [China]{.underline}]{.mark} in areas of its
highest capability, close to Chinese shores and far from the U.S.
homeland. [It is [an impossible task]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for
instance, the steps Washington must take to fight a war over Taiwan.
China has the natural, massive advantage of being close to the island's
coasts, all of which fall within range of Chinese air defenses. To repel
a PLA attack [[against Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates would [need **absurd** levels
of]{.mark} **modern [weaponry]{.mark}**]{.underline}---meaning a blank
check for the Pentagon. It would have to engage in what the sociologist
C. Wright Mills once called "the idiot's race": amassing missiles and
crafting military positions that stoke jingoism on both sides, heighten
instability, and lead each state to adopt the most malign
interpretations of the other's intentions. One must squint quite hard to
discern a theory of stability in a strategy that demands a favorable
imbalance of military power, the active proliferation of weapons
platforms, and muscle flexing in the name of signaling resolve.

[[Risking military escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} is [only **one** of
the ways]{.underline} that [[primacy has an **antagonistic
relationship** to stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. As I argued in Pacific
Power Paradox: American Statecraft and the Fate of the Asian Peace, any
U.S. drive for economic dominance will also undermine regional stability
because it involves breaking up the economic structures that have played
a vital role in preventing war in the Pacific. The [East
Asian]{.underline} development model based on exports and
interdependence was made possible because [political
leaders]{.underline} decided to [prioritize **national development**
over nationalist **revanchism**]{.underline}. Asian heads of state put
[dozens of territorial disputes]{.underline}, many of which still
endure, [on the back burner]{.underline} in order to create a thicket of
regional institutions to encourage trade and informal, consensus-based
habits of diplomacy. The result was both spectacular economic growth and
remarkable stability.

### Not Revisionist\-\--Defensive Realism\-\--2NC

#### China's a defensive realist.

**Jalil '19** \[Ghazala; April; Research Fellow at Institute of
Strategic Studies; Strategic Studies, "China's Rise: Offensive or
Defensive Realism,"
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360524492_China\'s_Rise_Offensive_or_Defensive_Realism\]
rohan

The claims of Mearsheimer's offensive realism are in contrast with
Waltz's defensive realism on several points. While Mearsheimer claims
that great powers act aggressively and aim to gain so much power that
they are the ultimate hegemons in the system, Waltz's [**[defensive
realism]{.mark}** [sees]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[states]{.mark} as
[acting **defensively**]{.mark} to maintain]{.underline} rather than
upset [the **balance of power**]{.underline}. For Waltz, the states are
primarily [concerned with [maintaining]{.mark}]{.underline} "their
[[position]{.mark} in the system]{.underline}."55 Defensive realists
argue that offence-defence balance favours the defence. 56 Therefore, a
robust defence and careful balancing should deter any aggressive
impulses from great powers. Defensive realism argues that great powers
are concerned with maintaining the status quo rather than maximising
their power because often the cost of expansion outweighs the benefits.
Defensive realism sees security dilemmas as a problem where an increase
in the power of one state increases the insecurity of the other causing
the latter to increase its power. Under the conditions of defensive
realism, [great powers]{.underline} would [[try to **alleviate**]{.mark}
any [security dilemmas]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than exacerbate it.

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} current [policy]{.underline} seems to be
[[firmly **rooted** in defensive realism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its
policy seems to be [aimed at maintaining]{.underline} the [**balance of
power** rather than **upsetting it**]{.underline}. As the earlier
section has argued, [China is [not a **revisionist
power**]{.mark}]{.underline} but a status quo one. The analysts like
Shiping Tang are convinced that China's security strategy flows out of
its realisation of the security dilemma whereby the [Chinese
[leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[understood]{.underline}]{.mark}
that an [[aggressive **expansionist**]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark} would
just]{.underline} [[lead to **counterbalancing
alliances**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "This recognition has led
[China]{.underline} to [adopt]{.underline} a defensive realism-rooted
security [strategy]{.underline} [[emphasising
**moderation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, self-[[restraint
and]{.underline}]{.mark} security
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**."57

#### China doesn't want to upend the existing order.

Ultimately, while there are [inevitable [disconnects]{.mark}
between]{.underline}, and within, words and actions, these initiatives
represent the [discursive mechanism [through]{.mark}
[which]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese [[officials
**articulate**]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[preferences]{.underline}]{.mark} for the international order and,
therefore, warrant deeper engagement. Importantly, their
[articulation]{.underline} of the international order
[[precludes]{.mark} the]{.underline} binary of [[status
quo-revisionist]{.underline}]{.mark} power
**[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In a traditional sense, [[China **cannot** be a **revisionist
power**]{.underline}]{.mark} if it [[centers]{.mark} core
bodies]{.underline} and principles [of [the existing order]{.mark}
in]{.underline} [their **vision** of the future]{.underline}. This
[[complicates]{.mark} general [arguments that China seeks to **upend**
the]{.mark} existing **[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, China is
not a status quo power either. Despite centering key international
bodies like the U.N. and associated institutions, the promotion of
multipolarity and particularistic universalism indicates that Chinese
officials seek to erode what they view as American hegemony and the
centrality of the Western liberal values the U.S. promotes as universal.

[[China's **foreign policy**]{.underline}]{.mark} discourse [[does
not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[**represent** an inherent threat
to **international order**]{.underline}]{.mark} per se. After all, the
international order has never been static and has always had competing
interpretations, including by officials in Washington. However, these
global initiatives do challenge the current dominant interpretation of
the international order promoted by the United States. which is espoused
in its "rules-based order" discourse. Consequently, to the extent that
the current order must be unipolar and defined by universalist Western
liberal values, China clearly represents a challenge.

[[China is **not** in]{.mark} a [strong]{.mark} [economic]{.mark}
[position]{.mark} as it has been reined in by the lingering aftereffects
of its real estate crisis, subdued domestic consumption, and the impacts
and uncertainty created by the trade war's tariffs]{.underline}.
[[Kicking off a global crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} would likely
[**[exacerbate]{.mark}** the economic [issues]{.mark}]{.underline} it
currently faces. Furthermore[, Taiwan represents up to 60% of China's
own chip imports.]{.underline} [If China attacks]{.underline} Taiwan [it
stands to \[destroy]{.underline}\]~~cripple~~ [its own
industries]{.underline} by starving them of chips. Besides chips
imports, [the [PRC]{.mark} is heavily **[dependent on
trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- comprising 37% of its GDP --- making it
even more vulnerable to disruptions in global trade.

According to a study done by Bloomberg Economics, [[in]{.mark} the event
of [a blockade]{.mark}, [global GDP]{.mark} would be [down
5%,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with China]{.mark} and the U.S[. seeing
shrinkage of **8.9%**]{.mark} and 3.3%,]{.underline} respectively. And
[in the event of an invasion, global GDP would be down
10.2%,]{.underline} with South Korea, Japan, and other East Asian
nations seeing the worst of the impact. The resulting \$10 trillion
price tag on merely the first year of the crisis incentivizes the
stakeholders to avoid confrontation. [[If any]{.mark} or all [of
Taiwan's foundries are destroyed]{.mark}, the [impact would be **even
greater**]{.mark} and the [economic depression would last **for a
decade**]{.mark}]{.underline} or more as nations attempt to build out
their own profitable foundries. Not to mention that this would likely
create a permanent rift between China and trade with the U.S. and the
EU.

#### It\'s the opposite. US actions have [devastated]{.underline} China's economy.

But as the American author James Baldwin wrote in 1963, "time reveals
the foundations on which any kingdom rests, and eats at those
foundations, and it destroys doctrines by proving them to be untrue."
[Even if [U.S. primacy]{.mark} was once [a **source** of]{.mark}
regional [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}, there is [[little basis to
think it will **promote**]{.mark} [harmony]{.mark} today]{.underline}.
The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' global
[[power]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[diminished]{.underline}]{.mark} over
the past generation, making it harder for Washington to direct the
world. Other states have a newfound desire and capacity to resist,
subvert, lash out against, or seek alternatives to U.S. preferences,
including through violence. And the power of these countries is likely
to continue to grow. It defies history to expect that dusk will never
come for U.S. hegemony, especially as [China]{.underline}---the world's
most populous state and Washington's primary global competitor---[draws
power]{.underline} from its central place [in the international economic
system]{.underline}.

Nevertheless, two of the most recent U.S. presidents---Barack
[**[Obama]{.mark}** and]{.underline} Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**--- charged themselves with the task of
indefinitely propping up the sun. And President Joe
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} has [picked up where]{.underline} both
[presidents left off]{.underline}. Initially, that meant taking steps to
[[constrain **Beijing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now, it means [[taking
steps to]{.mark} [weaken the **country**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obama
started the process by launching a high-profile "pivot to Asia" designed
to bolster the United States' regional military presence as a check
against China's rise while interweaving his country's economy into that
of eight states close to China's borders. Trump, who saw how China's
important economic position afforded it growing global influence,
launched a trade war with Beijing. His administration also deepened
Washington's ties to Taiwan. [Biden]{.underline} has
[increased]{.underline} the U.S. [military buildup]{.underline},
[facilitated]{.underline} a [regional military buildup]{.underline}, and
attempted to assemble the beginnings of an anti-Chinese containment
coalition along with local Asian powers.

These [choices run]{.underline} headlong [into]{.underline} what the
[preservation of peace demands]{.underline}. [[Kneecapping China's
**economy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [engaging in]{.underline} an
[[endless]{.mark} [arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}, aligning with local
despotic regimes [[to encircle **Beijing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[alienating smaller **countries**]{.underline}]{.mark} by demanding
that they [choose between China and the United States]{.underline} might
give Washington more short-term power in Asia. But these are the
ingredients of regional fracture and eventual war, not stability. The
United States' Asia policy, then, is at an unacknowledged crossroads.
Washington can support regional peace or pursue regional primacy, but it
cannot do both.

### Not Revisionist\-\--Finance\-\--2NC

#### Financial barriers [constrain]{.underline} revisionist potential.

**Sampson '22** \[Michael and Jue Wang; December 1; Assistant Professor
of International Relations at the Institute of Political Science, Leiden
University; Sage Journals, "Status-quo enhancing versus status-quo
challenging change in global economic governance: the case of China in
finance and trade,"

[Related to]{.underline} the [**[structural constraints]{.mark}** of the
regime]{.underline}, the [[response of existing
**institutions**]{.underline}]{.mark} to challengers can also
[constrain]{.underline} the [prospects for success]{.underline} of
change proposals. Existing institutions can either respond favorably and
adapt to challenges in order to remain relevant, [[granting]{.mark}
**[concessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} to dissatisfied powers in return
for their support.11 At other times they can successfully resist change,
and the degree to which they can do so often depends on the ability of
the dissatisfied states to exercise meaningful outside options.12

The above-mentioned structural features are important in determining the
chances of success for challenger states' change proposals. However,
focusing solely on the structural features of a regime can result in
neglect of other important factors driving outcomes. For example, the
structural character of a regime cannot explain why different change
proposals from the same state yield different degrees of success within
the same regime. In order to better understand the full range of
outcomes, attention should go beyond structural constraints and toward
the content of the institutional change proposals themselves. In this
article we draw a distinction between status-quo enhancing and
status-quo challenging institutional change proposals.13 We define
status-quo enhancing changes as reforms that advance the stated goals
and objectives of the existing regime and so serve to drive change that
would otherwise not take place due to inertia. Status-quo challenging
changes conversely undermine or substantially change the objectives of
the existing regime. We utilize China as a case by which to develop
these theoretical sub-types because in the areas of both trade and
finance it has proposed both status-quo enhancing and status-quo
challenging proposals.

In finance [[China's]{.mark} measures]{.underline} [for [**reforming**
the US dollar]{.mark}]{.underline} dominated international monetary
system generated mixed results: the ones that [[enhanced]{.mark} the
[IMF]{.mark}'s [authority]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[legitimacy]{.underline} succeed [[whereas those **challenged** the
**s**]{.mark}**tatus-[quo]{.mark}**]{.underline} [IMF [governance
**structure**]{.mark} and rules [failed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[China]{.underline}, together with other Asian economies, successfully
built a regional financial governance framework that endorse Chinese
interests and Asian preferences, because the framework complies with the
IMF's functions in core issue areas. In trade,
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has been successful in
**[[establishing]{.underline}]{.mark}** a new model of [[trade]{.mark}
agreement]{.underline} that [differs]{.underline} quite
**[substantially]{.underline}** from that adopted by other major
economic powers. This has been successful because the differences in the
agreements are in line with existing WTO rules on special and
differential treatment of developing states. At the same time
[China]{.underline} has [[failed to **secure**]{.underline}]{.mark}
sufficient [[support]{.mark} to]{.underline} successfully [alter the
dominant understanding of **market economy** status]{.underline} which
would go against the established understanding of that term at the WTO.
We draw on these findings to conclude that status quo-enhancing changes
are, all else equal, more likely to succeed than status-quo challenging
strategies because the former create opportunities for productive
coalition building with already powerful members of an established
institution. Status-quo challenging changes meanwhile require a much
larger and unwieldy coalition of less powerful dissatisfied states in
order to secure change.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} 2017 [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} National
Security Strategy [[brands **China**]{.underline}]{.mark} a
'[[revisionist]{.underline}]{.mark}' power [challenging the US-led
**international order**]{.underline}. Traditionally,
[revisionist]{.underline} has been [understood as meaning **strongly
dissatisfied**]{.underline} with the status quo. [China]{.underline} has
[experienced a rise]{.underline} in its national power. It has become at
least a peer of the conservative powers and thus can mount a full-scale
challenge against the international order.

[[Yet this **misinterprets**]{.underline}]{.mark} the role
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is currently playing. [[There is an
**alternative** to]{.underline}]{.mark} what might be described as
'**[[revolutionary]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [[revisionism]{.mark}:
'incremental' revisionism]{.underline} (Robert Gilpin).

'[[Incremental]{.underline}]{.mark}' revisionist
[[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, like revolutionary revisionists,

dissatisfaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the status quo because they
still benefit from it in some ways. Therefore, [they are [not **bent**
on]{.mark} a **[full-scale challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A comparison between Interwar Showa Japan (1926--1941) and post-Cold War
China (1989--2019) across five dimensions shows the former to be a
paradigmatic case of the revolutionary revisionist state power pursuing
radical foreign policy options while post-Cold War

### Not Revisionist\-\--Reactionary\-\--2NC

ARL

There has also been a great deal of [debate on whether post-Mao China is
a status quo or revisionist power]{.underline} (Chan et al. 2018; Chen
et al. 2014). This typology [classifies China as a **revisionist
power**]{.underline} throughout the post-Mao reformist era and sees it
as [having transitioned]{.underline} from orthodox revisionism **[to
radical reformism]{.underline}**. [China has given up]{.underline} its
earlier (Maoist) [opposition to]{.underline} the [dominant normative
order]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it [has]{.underline} [become
socialized into its institutions]{.underline} (Johnston 2003). It [has
not accepted]{.underline} the [full range of liberal norms]{.underline}
and values [promoted by the West]{.underline} (in particular democracy
and human rights) [but]{.underline} these [never established enough of a
consensus]{.underline} among states [to really become part of the
normative order]{.underline} (Johnston 2003). China has generally
[abided by the established normative]{.underline} [order]{.underline} as
it has looked [to be identified]{.underline} by others [as a
"**responsible power**"]{.underline} whose rise is not a threat to other
states (Deng 2008). Nevertheless, because of its sheer magnitude,
[China's economic rise has significantly altered the global hierarchies
of power and status]{.underline}, even if this was not the immediate
intention or focus of its policies. This [made it an orthodox
revisionist]{.underline} and not a status quo power during this period.
As its power has grown and China has become more assertive, [it is
beginning to seek out more **significant changes** to rules and norms
and]{.underline} [to promote **new institutional
arrangements**]{.underline}, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative (Yan 2014). These [changes have
the potential to dramatically alter]{.underline} the [global hierarchies
of power and status]{.underline}, [**elevating China** and other
emerging states]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [China]{.underline} (for the
time being) [continues to pursue change through reformist
means]{.underline}, [working to]{.underline} gradually [change the
normative order from within]{.underline} rather than by undermining it
or challenging it directly (Deng 2014). Thus, [China today can most
accurately be classified as a radical reformist.]{.underline}

This typology [broadens]{.underline} the [number of cases]{.underline}
[categorized as being revisionist]{.underline} [and]{.underline} even
[classifies as revisionists]{.underline} some cases whose revisionism is
a matter of intense debate or which are usually thought of as being
status quo states. Nevertheless, [in constructing types]{.underline} and
subtypes [that differentiate revisionist cases]{.underline} based on
clear and observable criteria, [this system of
classification]{.underline} [provides]{.underline} a [way to distinguish
between]{.underline} the [multitude of diverse cases]{.underline}.
Moreover, by incorporating aims as well as means into its classification
of types/subtypes, something that existing typologies have not done,
this typology informs us both about the scope of a particular
revisionist state's aims as well as the strength of its commitments and
how far it is willing to go to achieve them. This gives us a clearer
picture of the nature of the challenge any particular state categorized
as being revisionist represents to the status quo and provides a useful
starting point for theorizing about the sources of their revisionist
behavior.

### Not Revisionist\-\--Self Fulfilling Prophecy\-\--2NC

#### Characterizing China as a rising power is a self-fulfilling prophecy which drives conflict.

**Jalil '19** \[Ghazala; April; Research Fellow at Institute of
Strategic Studies; Strategic Studies, "China's Rise: Offensive or
Defensive Realism,"

rohan

[[**Far** from]{.mark} being a **[revisionist]{.mark}**
power]{.underline} maximising state, [China's behaviour]{.underline}
seems to be [more of a **status quo power**]{.underline}. Instead of
being a threat and a source of instability, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}
can be a [source of **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region.
China's foreign policy seems to be [[driven by defensive
realism]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than principles of offensive realism
as Mearsheimer argues. The conflict between [China as a [rising
power]{.mark}]{.underline} and the US as a status quo power [is [not
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is possible to avoid the
Thucydides's Trap. [China's rise is **[not]{.mark}** as [much of a
threat as]{.mark} the **Western [debates]{.mark}** [make it out to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}. In many ways, it may provide opportunities
rather than challenges. However, theories and analyses presented by
scholars such as Mearsheimer would certainly lead to conflict if
followed by the US policymakers. [[If]{.mark} [Washington **continues**
to believe]{.mark}]{.underline} and act on the assumption that [increase
in]{.underline} the [[Chinese power poses a
**threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the US military and diplomatic
presence and economic interests in the region and opts for a containment
and encirclement policy towards China ─ [[it would amount to a
**self-fulfilling prophesy**]{.underline}]{.mark} where the [[conflict
would **materialise**]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two powers.
Engagement rather than containment is the policy that would lead to a
more stable and secure regional and global environment.

#### Threat perception is incredibly inaccurate. It's self-fulfilling.

**Jackson '23** \[Van; January 16; Professor of International Relations

Security in Context; Foreign Affairs, "The Problem With Primacy,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/asia/problem-primacy\] rohan

For **[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the increased emphasis on
Asia has been largely driven by the [[fear]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[China's]{.mark} **growing [strength]{.mark}**]{.underline} will
[[impinge on]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates'
[ability to shape the **global order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[Pentagon]{.underline} has [[described Beijing]{.mark} as a]{.underline}
"[[near-peer **competitor**]{.underline}]{.mark}" and a "[pacing
threat]{.underline}." In response, [the United States]{.underline} has
**[[entered an arms race]{.underline}]{.mark}** against a rapidly
modernizing People's Liberation Army (PLA). It is a contest with no
apparent end. The U.S. defense budget went from \$700 billion in 2018 to
\$768 billion in 2020. For 2023, it will eclipse \$850 billion. Aid to
Ukraine accounts for only a little over \$50 billion of that total. The
United States is also offering ever more advanced weapons technologies
to friends and allies.

[Washington's **efforts**]{.underline} to retain its primacy in the
region [[go **beyond** amassing]{.underline}]{.mark} and proliferating
[[armaments]{.underline}]{.mark}. To achieve even greater dominance,
[the United States]{.underline} has [[turned the]{.underline}]{.mark}
global [political [economy into a **zero-sum** struggle against
**Beijing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Biden has retained
[[Trump]{.mark}-era]{.underline} student-visa restrictions targeted at
the Chinese and expanded his predecessor's tariffs, sanctions, and
company blacklists. In October, for example, [[admin]{.mark}istration
officials [banned]{.mark} U.S.-made]{.underline} [[semiconductor
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} from being sold [[to
Washington's]{.underline}]{.mark} self-[proclaimed
[competitor]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is a remarkable step, given that
semiconductors were largely irrelevant to global power politics until
the United States christened them a major focal point of national
security. By characterizing these technologies---which are found in
everyday goods such as smart phones and televisions---as vital to
national strength and prosperity while also declaring that its nemesis
must not be allowed to have them, [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[made]{.mark} its **[radical militarism]{.mark}**]{.underline} readily
**[[apparent]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**Li 18** \[Wang is an independent journalist in Chinese policy.

Thus, [China has adopted]{.underline} a [hybrid approach
of]{.underline}, on the one side [cooperation]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} on the other side [display of military
power]{.underline}. Nonetheless, [China is highly aware of the political
reality]{.underline}, namely that [it lacks a legal basis
for]{.underline} [expanded Arctic involvement which results in caution
from most Arctic states towards China.]{.underline} As a result,
[Beijing]{.underline} **[highly prefers cooperation]{.underline}** [over
military pressure and confrontation]{.underline}. It works toward being
[portrayed as "a **reliable partner** as opposed to a
competitor]{.underline}". It is [using scientific diplomacy to
gain]{.underline} the [trust of important Arctic members]{.underline},
such as Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. And [despite]{.underline} China
[stating that the Arctic territory]{.underline} [should be regarded as
common territory]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} [formerly]{.underline}
[had to accept]{.underline} the [territorial sovereignty]{.underline} of
the Arctic states when becoming a permanent observer. Nonetheless,
China's rising power on the global stage makes the Arctic states uneasy
and fearful that China will engage in strong norm revision at some
point. But in my opinion, [overly limiting Chinese
involvement]{.underline} and being suspicious of its every move [will
only lead China to exert norm revisionism]{.underline}
**[sooner]{.underline}**.

Conclusion

To conclude, [China should not inherently be considered a
threat]{.underline} [to Arctic security]{.underline}. Generally, [China
focuses on defending its geo-economic interests]{.underline} within the
current institutional framework. In the case of the Arctic, [China
stresses cooperation]{.underline}, as is [evident with the bilateral
agreements]{.underline} concluded with Iceland and Denmark and requests
[to be included in the Arctic Council]{.underline}. Though [many feel
uncomfortable with China's assertiveness]{.underline}, its growing power
cannot be ignored and should be considered. I share the opinion that
**[China is not inherently a threat]{.underline}** to Arctic security,
but members of the Arctic Council should be aware that China will
resolve to military [Categorizing China as a threat without]{.underline}
objectively [considering and understanding]{.underline} Chinese
[interests]{.underline} [will]{.underline} inevitably **[lead to rising
tension in the Arctic]{.underline}** and elsewhere where Beijing's
strategic and economic interests are at stake. Of course, [it remains to
be seen how much goodwill]{.underline} both [China and the West will
show]{.underline} in the face of rising competition [over Arctic
territory and resources]{.underline} and a re-evaluation will be
necessary in the future.

While the [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[**Chinese**
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark} to Gulf security diverge on the question
of means, they [[have the **same end:**]{.mark}
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. While [American [naval

brokering]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Iran-Saudi Arabia deal
[[reflect]{.mark} different]{.underline}
**[[approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [both]{.underline} are aimed at
[[preventing]{.mark} military **[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
would threaten their oil supply. Unlike in the Asia-Pacific, where
China's apparent intention to absorb Taiwan is considered a major
security threat in Washington, in the Gulf the two superpowers share
strategic interests. If China can contribute to security in the region
without threatening the United States' well-established policy, their
strategies can therefore coexist or even reinforce each other.

The conditions are there for this, at least in theory, since [China's
[Gulf **strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline} is so distinct from that of the
United States. Beijing [[doesn't appear to be]{.mark} [attempting to
**challenge** Washington]{.mark}'s dominance]{.underline} as a provider
of military deterrence in the region, which would likely [lead
to]{.underline} a dynamic of [zero-sum competition]{.underline}
developing there. Instead, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is attempting to
**[[contribute to stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in alternative ways
-- [enabling **[mediation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, leading
**[[multilateral initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, driving [[economic
development]{.underline}]{.mark}, and backing authoritarian regimes
domestically with investments and technology -- that could potentially
slot in alongside the traditional American policies. The
[[**possibility** exists for]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[division of

**[[minimize]{.underline}]{.mark}** the potential [[grounds of

Beijing's Positioning in the International Order

At some level, [[China]{.mark} is **[not revising]{.mark}** its
[position]{.mark} in the international system]{.underline} at all.
Instead, [it is [choosing to]{.mark} position itself as a
**[cofound]{.mark}**er]{.underline} of the existing post-WWII order in
order [to **[reinforce]{.mark}** that [order's **defense of
sovereignty** and **reshape**]{.mark} its [definition of
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the meaning of human rights,
[[rather than]{.mark} seeking to **[overturn]{.mark}** it]{.underline}.
Ukraine is one example of an obstacle to this project, however, because
the realities of geopolitics (the desire to keep Russia close) have
forced China into inconsistency. To be clear,
[**[inconsistency]{.mark}** is [not]{.mark} in itself an
**[insurmountable]{.mark} problem**. The]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has]{.mark} **[frequently]{.mark}** been **[inconsistent]{.mark}** in
its [international behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance,
[[China]{.mark} ratified **UNCLOS**]{.underline} (the UN Convention on
the Law of the Sea), [with some exclusions]{.underline}, had its dispute
with the Philippines over claims in the South China Sea rejected under
UNCLOS terms in 2016, and in turn [**[refused]{.mark}** to accept the
[judgement, earning **condemnation** from many]{.mark}]{.underline}
countries including the US.24 [[Yet]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} itself has
[never ratified **UNCLOS**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China's problem is
that it has not yet put in the **extensive investment** into shaping
**international order** that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has, and therefore, the [breaches]{.mark} that
[it commits]{.mark} take place [in]{.mark} a [context where Beijing has
**less credit**]{.mark} with the international community as a
whole.]{.underline} China is aware that it has work to do on
trust-building and is putting its efforts into largely economic and
development-oriented projects, using umbrella terms such as the
Community of Common Destiny as well as the Belt and Road Initiative.
These projects have had some success, particularly in the Global South.
But they still suffer from two problems. First, Chinese development work
is still perceived as primarily in service of Beijing's goals. Second,
like all Chinese policy, it suffers from a "black box" syndrome:
decision-making is not transparent and therefore is highly
unpredictable. US policy, even with some flaws and hypocrisies overtime,
has been relatively transparent. For much, if not all, of the past few
decades, the "sources of American conduct" have not been that hard to
discern. This does not mean failure for China's project to redefine
world order while preserving many of its aspects. China has identified
real flaws in the system that give it openings with actors around the
globe: a new volatility in US policy and priorities since the mid-2010s;
a Global South increasingly unwilling to take orders from richer
capitals in the North; and a worldwide hunger for economic,
technological and cultural options that do not simply derive from the
West. Yet, [its **enthusiasm** to claim ownership of the world created
in]{.underline} 1945 strongly suggests that Beijing is content with much
of the order and structure that exists. [The major change it seeks is
that the norms which inform that order should be ones **more amenable**
to the **economic goals**, **security concerns**, and **political
culture** that Beijing prefer]{.underline}---a world not always firmly
pitched against liberal norms, but where liberal values carry no merit
or moral freight in their own right. [[Where]{.mark} the
[liberal]{.mark} international [system helps]{.mark}]{.underline}
Beijing, [[China **does not pushback**]{.underline}]{.mark} against it
on principle. [Where is needs to be revised]{.underline},

system. After all]{.underline}, as [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has pointed

### Not Revisionist\-\--AT: Mearsheimer\-\--2NC

#### Mearsheimer is [wrong]{.underline} about Ukraine AND his theory lacks [explanatory power]{.underline} because it ignores [domestic factors]{.underline}.

**Motyl '23** \[Alexander J. Motyl; Professor of political science at

KL

John J. **[Mearsheimer]{.underline}**, the University of Chicago's
realist foreign policy guru, [published his latest analysis of the
**Russian-Ukrainian War**]{.underline} on a historic day: June 23, when
Russia was roiled by a failed putsch led by the Wagner Group's Yevgeny
Prigozhin.

Just as Russian President Vladimir Putin's fate, as well as that of his
regime, hung in the balance, just as a successful coup could have
altered the course of the war, led to civil bloodshed and the possible
disintegration of the Russian Federation --- all scenarios invoked by
Putin in his address to the nation --- [[**Mearsheimer** **failed** to
give]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[attention]{.underline}]{.mark}
whatsoever [[to]{.mark} Russia's **[domestic politics]{.mark}**,
preferring to [focus]{.mark} instead, as he always does,
[**exclusively** on]{.mark} the Russia state's [relations]{.mark} with
**Ukraine** and the **West**.]{.underline}

[[This would be like ignoring **domestic factors**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. conduct of the wars in [[**Vietnam**,
**Iraq** and **Afghanistan**]{.underline}]{.mark};
**[French]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[British]{.underline}**
[hopes for [**appeasement** in 1938]{.mark}]{.underline}; [the role of
power struggles and [ideology in]{.mark} the [**Soviet** decisions to
invade]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[Hungary]{.underline}**,
**[Czechoslovakia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Afghanistan]{.underline}** --- [and, of course, Putin's]{.underline}
very [personal decision to launch]{.underline} a poorly planned all-out
[attack on **Ukraine**]{.underline} in 2022.

Prigozhin's march on Moscow, though unsuccessful, revealed to Russians
and the world that the Russian state and regime are brittle, that Putin
is increasingly vulnerable, and that the proximate and ultimate outcome
of the war depends as much on what Russians do within their state as on
what they do to Ukrainians with their state.

[Mearsheimer's oversight is **no accident**]{.underline}. **[[Domestic
factors]{.underline}]{.mark}** are [**[irrelevant]{.underline}** [to his
**theoretical model**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That doesn't mean that he
has no insights to make that are worthy of attention; it does mean that
[his [predictions]{.mark}]{.underline} and policy recommendations
[are]{.underline} so [[**utterly divorced** from]{.mark} anything
**resembling [reality]{.mark}**]{.underline} as to be wrong a priori.

Putin, for one, would agree. His fateful decision to invade Ukraine was
based exclusively on Mearsheimerian balance of power calculations.
Putin, like Mearsheimer, saw that Russia had a larger military, economy
and population than Ukraine. Naturally, it would win, and quickly --- a
view that many policymakers and analysts inspired by Mearsheimer's
realism also shared. Had America's Founding Fathers been realists of
Mearsheimer's ilk, they would never have dared to declare independence
from the reigning global superpower in 1776.

[Unsurprisingly, although **[Mearsheimer]{.mark}**'s lengthy
[paper]{.mark} has 68 endnotes, [not]{.mark} a single [one references a
Russian- or Ukrainian]{.mark}-language [source]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Given such limitations, [Mearsheimer cannot access the **views of real
Russians or Ukrainians**]{.underline} on the left, right, and center ---
[who might have alerted him to the **brittleness** of the regime and the
**weakness** of Putin --- and must therefore rely on]{.underline} and
take at face value the [**foreign-policy [statements]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **Russian [leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} their
**[[propagandists]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

There is, after all, no other way to buttress his claims about Russia's
supposed fear of NATO and the West. Russian- and Ukrainian-language
sources, as well as Sovietologists and post-Sovietologists, might have
reminded Mearsheimer that Russian leaders habitually engage in
mendacity, a tradition that goes back at least as far as Vladimir Lenin,
who promised to liberate non-Russians and instead imposed a colonial
yoke on them.

[[Putin]{.mark} and his comrades [see **Nazis** where there **aren't
any**]{.mark}]{.underline}: Ukraine. [They see [**militarization** where
there **isn't any**]{.mark}]{.underline}: ditto. [[They
insisted]{.underline}]{.mark} in late 2021 and early 2022 [that [they
**would never**]{.mark}, ever [invade]{.mark} Ukraine --- and [then
did]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They deny]{.underline}, still, [targeting
Ukrainian **civilian**]{.underline} target**[s]{.underline}**. They
deny, still, having destroyed the Kakhovka dam. [[The list]{.mark}
[could go on **ad infinitum**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[And yet, **bizarrely**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [when [Russians]{.mark}
say they [fear **Ukrain**]{.mark}ian membership [in
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and U.S. nuclear weapons on Ukraine's
eastern border, [[Mearsheimer **believes them**]{.mark}, when he should
be asking himself whether such **ostensible fears** have **any grounding
in reality**]{.underline} and what the real reasons might be.

I've made these points many times. For starters, [**absolutely no one**,
including the Russians and Ukrainians, expected Ukraine to become a NATO
member for at least **20 years**.]{.underline} And in 2014, the year the
war actually began, there was no talk of Ukraine's joining, by either
the Ukrainians, the West or the Russians. Ukraine didn't matter to the
West's perceptions of its security. In contrast, Ukraine mattered to
Russian perceptions, not because of any actual military threat ---
Ukraine had some 6,000 battle-ready troops in 2014 --- but because of
the ideological threat the democratic Maidan Revolution posed to Putin's
claims to be a legitimate autocrat.

[Obviously, official]{.underline} Russian [statements]{.underline}
**[would never admit]{.underline}** [to such]{.underline} an
interpretation. [Russian-language analysts]{.underline}, and their
Ukrainian counterparts, [could easily have briefed Mearsheimer and
helped **correct his myopia**]{.underline}.

Mearsheimer notes in his analysis that, "I am attempting to predict the
future, which is not easy to do, given that we live in an uncertain
world. Thus, I am not arguing that I have the truth; in fact, some of my
claims may be proved wrong."

Indeed, he doesn't, and indeed, they will.

All these [[**developments** bring up]{.underline}]{.mark} the debate of
[[whether China]{.mark} should be **[considered]{.mark}**]{.underline} a
"[[revisionist]{.underline}]{.mark} power" or a "status quo preserving"
actor. [[Kissinger]{.underline}]{.mark} goes beyond this duality and
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} that [China]{.underline} has a search for
a peaceful order in its historical memory. However, the current reality
shows that China [has developed]{.underline} a **[[hybrid
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}** model in which it both protects and
occasionally challenges the status quo. For example,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** is both [[committed to the current
order]{.underline}]{.mark} as a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council and is trying to build new structures outside of this
order by establishing alternative trade blocs. As in Kennedy's
historical analysis, powers often want to benefit from the benefits of
the current order while at the same time redefining this order according
to their own interests. China also continues this dual strategy with
great skill.

As a result, [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} understanding of global
hegemony presents a structure where historical continuity and modern
strategic calculations merge. At the intersection of Kennedy's analyses
based on economic determinism and Kissinger's historical diplomacy and
geopolitical predictions, China's rise can be evaluated as both an
opportunity and a challenge. China aims to be a central power in the
future, as it has in the past, and it is [[trying to **achieve** this
not through **military expansionism**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} through [economic]{.underline},
[**[tech]{.mark}nological** and **cultural
[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although historical experience shows
that such powers eventually reach a balance, it is inevitable that China
will radically transform world politics in this process.

The [[**competition** between the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, the dominant power, and the EU on one
side [[and **China**]{.mark} and **Russia**, challenging **authoritarian
powers**]{.underline}, on the other side [[is **not merely**]{.mark} a
conflict in terms of]{.underline} geopolitical **[[hard
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** and materials, but [[it is also about
contesting for **beliefs** and **political values**]{.mark}. [China has
**amped up** its **economic**, **military**, and **technological
advances**]{.mark} [with the intent to **undermine** the **U.S.-led
existing order**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} to [create a new **China-led
international order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this purpose, China is
looking to rebuild partnerships across the world, particularly in the
Global South. While China's influence has been on the rise among these
states, its ties in Europe have been deteriorating primarily due to
China's coercive economic and diplomatic policies, but also Beijing's
indirect support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The EU, on its
part, has started to reinforce cooperation with like-minded partners,
equipping itself with defensive tools designed to help identify threats
and articulate common responses. In this context, the [[growth in
**transatlantic ties**]{.mark} could be [**crucial** to rebuilding an
**effecti**]{.mark}**ve**, representative **[l]{.mark}**iberal
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[o]{.mark}**rder]{.underline} that is

#### Global authoritarianism causes extinction---only strong influence by democratic states solve

Existential Risk "Collapse, Recovery, and Existential Risk," in *How
Worlds Collapse: What History, Systems, and Complexity Can Teach Us
About Our Modern World and Fragile Future*, p. 74-76. Accessed online
via University of Michigan //DH

[[A world dominated by totalitarian states would be]{.underline}]{.mark}
more incompetent, [[more war-prone]{.mark}, less
cooperative]{.underline}, and more inhibitive of progress [[than]{.mark}
one dominated by [democratic states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our current
world is not particularly competent, peaceful, cooperative, or
progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world would be worse. [[It would
increase the risk of]{.mark} another [collapse and
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} and could shape the future toward less
desirable trajectories (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states are incompetent. They are bad at forecasting and
dealing with disasters]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen
most clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in
which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikötter, 2010;
Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely,
if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). "Established autocracies" (or
"personal"/"sultanist") are particularly bad, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then a world dominated by them would likely be worse at responding to
risks of collapse and extinction.

A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have major
wars. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely (if ever) go to
war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so [[a world dominated by
democracies has fewer wars]{.underline}.
[Miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}[ulation [might be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[a]{.mark} particular [[problem for totalitarian states due to
personalization and disincentives for accurate
info]{.mark}rmation,]{.underline} leading to well-known strategic
disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II (Bialer,
1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam Hussein's
rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [[War
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} collapse and [[extinction]{.mark} more
[likely, by]{.mark} raising the chance of [w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [being used]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Linked to this, [[totalitarian states are less cooperative]{.mark} than
democratic states]{.underline}. While cooperation is possible (Ginsburg,
2020), [their [internal norms are characterized by
paranoia]{.mark}]{.underline} and treachery, and their lack of
transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to agreements.
[[This is bad for]{.mark} all [risks that require cooperation such
as]{.mark} [pandemics or climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tomasik,
2015).

Finally, [continued social and [scientific progress is likely to reduce
risks of]{.mark}]{.underline} collapse and
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Social progress could reduce global
inequality and other risk factors. [[Scientific progress could help
address natural risks and climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sandberg,
2018), differentially increase defensive rather than offensive power
(Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019), [[and solve safety challenges in AI or
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology (Russell, 2019).
[[However,]{.underline}]{.mark} as we will now discuss [[totalitarian
states would likely inhibit social progress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, [democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy]{.underline}. Second, they have within
themselves the mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50)
years, the lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and
non-white people have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has
expanded, and could continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the
moral universe is long, but given the right conditions, it might just
bend toward justice (King, 1968). A global society dominated by these
values, and with the possibility of improving more, has a better
longterm potential. [A totalitarian-dominated world,]{.underline} on the
other hand, [would reduce the space for resistance and
progress---distorting the human trajectory.]{.underline}

[We should be particularly concerned about "bottlenecks" at which values
are particularly important---where there is a risk of
"locking-in]{.underline}" [some]{.underline} particular set of (possibly
far from optimal) [values]{.underline}. While they are currently faroff,
[future technologies such as artificial general intelligence, space
settlement, life extension (of autocrats), or much better surveillance
could enable lock-in]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

[[A]{.mark} long-lasting [totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated [world
would]{.mark} extend the period of time humanity would spend with a
heightened risk of collapse or extinction, as well as increased
potential for distortion of the human trajectory and the possibility
that a "[lock-in"]{.mark} event may occur]{.underline}. This example
illustrates the possibility of a "negative recovery," [[resulting in a
trajectory]{.underline} [with less or no scientific and social
progress]{.underline}]{.mark} [and a less favorable geopolitical
situation, [which would threaten the destruction of humanity]{.mark}'s
longterm potential]{.underline}.

### !---Democracy---AT: DPT False

#### Democratic Peace Theory has robust empirical support -- democracies are significantly more peaceful than autocracies

Michael **Doyle**, 6/18/**24**, \[Professor of International Affairs,
Law, and Political Science at Columbia University and the author of Cold
Peace: Avoiding the New Cold War\], Foreign Affairs, "Why They Don't
Fight," https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/why-they-dont-fight-doyle,
mm

[[Few hypotheses in i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [are more
influential than d]{.mark}emocratic [p]{.mark}eace
[t]{.mark}heory]{.underline}---the idea that democracies do not go to
war with one another. [[The idea]{.underline}]{.mark}, the political
scientist Jack Levy wrote, "**[[comes as close as anything we have to an
empirical law]{.mark} in international relations]{.underline}**." It has
motivated U.S. foreign policy for nearly a century. In the early 1900s,
U.S. President Woodrow Wilson embraced democracy promotion as a means to
peace. During the Cold War, successive administrations spoke of the
standoff with the Soviet bloc using grand ideological terminology. No
distillation was grander than President Ronald Reagan's address before
the British Parliament in 1982, in which he claimed that the West
exercised "consistent restraint and peaceful intentions" and then
proceeded (seemingly without irony) to call for a "campaign for
democracy" and a "crusade for freedom" around the world. Democratic
peace theory became especially influential once the Cold War ended,
leaving the United States truly ascendant. In his 1994 State of the
Union address, President Bill Clinton claimed that "the best strategy to
ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the
advance of democracy elsewhere." His administration then surged aid to
nascent post-Soviet democracies. Clinton's successor, George W. Bush,
was equally vocal about the need to advance liberalism in order to
promote peace, telling the 2004 Republican National Convention, "As
freedom advances, heart by heart, and nation by nation, America will be
more secure and the world more peaceful." As president, Bush even used
democratic peace theory as one of the justifications for invading Iraq.
In a speech on the war in November 2003, he declared, "The advance of
freedom leads to peace." The idea that democracy breeds peace, however,
is at best half true. The United States has repeatedly attacked other
countries. Europe's major democracies also have a long history of
intervening in other regions, such as the Sahel. And rather than marking
the permanent triumph of liberal democracy, the post--Cold War period is
now defined by growing divisions and conflict. As is now plain, the
spread of liberalism does not by itself curtail fighting. Yet the
proliferation of [[wars carried out by democracies does not
disprove]{.mark} democratic peace theory wholesale]{.underline}.
[[Liberal state]{.underline}s]{.mark} may not act peaceably toward
everyone, but they [[act peaceably toward one
another]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are no clear-cut cases of one
democracy going to war against another, nor do any seem forthcoming. In
fact, the global divisions emerging today confirm democratic peace
theory: once again, the line runs between liberal states and
authoritarian ones, with the United States and its mostly democratic
allies on one side and autocracies, most notably China and Russia, on
the other. The world, then, could be peaceful if all states became
liberal democracies. But until that happens, the world will likely
remain mired in a dangerous ideological standoff. [Democratic peace
theory has a long history]{.underline}. In 1776, the American
revolutionary Thomas Paine argued that liberal states do not fight one
another, writing that "the Republics of Europe are all (and we may say
always) in peace." When Paine's country gained independence and then
drafted its constitution, the document implicitly referred to the idea
that democracies should be conflict-averse. It placed the authority to
declare war in the legislature---the branch with members directly
elected by the public---in part to prevent the country from entering
unpopular conflicts. Democratic peace theory had early proponents across
the Atlantic, as well. Its most influential initial champion was the
German philosopher Immanuel Kant. In 1795, Kant published Perpetual
Peace, an essay that took the form of a hypothetical peace treaty and
that established the concept's theoretical foundations. Representative
republics, Kant explained, did not fight one another for a mix of
institutional, ideological, and economic reasons. Kant's writings called
for states to adopt a representative republican form of government with
an elected legislative body and a separation of powers among the
executive, judiciary, and legislative branches---all guaranteed by
constitutional law. Kant's republic was far from a modern democracy;
only male property holders could vote and become what he called "active
citizens." Nonetheless, he argued that elected representation would
inspire caution and that the separation of powers would produce careful
deliberation. Although these forces would not guarantee peace, he
admitted, they would select for rational and popular conflicts. If "the
consent of the citizens is required to decide whether or not war is to
be declared," Kant wrote, "it is very natural that they will have great
hesitation in embarking on so dangerous an enterprise." For doing so, he
continued, would mean calling down on themselves all the miseries of
war, such as doing the fighting themselves, supplying the costs of the
war from their own resources, painfully making good the ensuing
devastation, and, as the crowning evil, having to take upon themselves a
burden of debt which will embitter peace itself and which can never be
paid off on account of the constant threat of new wars. But under a
constitution in which the subject is not a citizen, and which is
therefore not republican, it is the simplest thing in the world to go to
war. For the head of state is not a fellow citizen, but the owner of the
state, and a war will not force him to make the slightest sacrifice so
far as his banquets, hunts, pleasure palaces and court festivals are
concerned. He can thus decide on war, without any significant reason, as
a kind of amusement, and unconcernedly leave it to the diplomatic corps
(who are always ready for such purposes) to justify the war for the sake
of propriety. Kant also called for republics to make commitments to
peace and universal hospitality. The former idea entailed a commitment
to peaceful relations and collective self-defense, rather like NATO's.
The latter meant treating all international visitors without hostility,
offering asylum to people whose lives were at risk, and allowing
visitors to share their ideas and propose commercial exchanges. This
combination, Kant said, would build security, create mutual respect, and
generate economic ties that lead to tranquility. And thus, republic by
emerging republic, the combination would create peace. Kant did not
argue that his ideas would stop tension and conflict between republics
and autocracies. In fact, he argued that representative republics might
become suspicious of states not ruled by their citizens. But he did
believe that liberal values such as human rights and respect for
property would curb a country's desire for glory, fear of conquest, and
need to plunder---three forces that drive states to war. He therefore
thought that liberal republics would be respectful and restrained when
addressing one another, even as they remained suspicious and fearful of
nonrepublics. Views similar to Kant's on liberty, republics, commerce,
and peace spread throughout nineteenth-century Europe and beyond. French
Foreign Minister Francois Guizot, a conservative liberal who served from
1840 to 1848, spoke enthusiastically about mutual freedom as a
foundation for an entente with the United Kingdom. British Prime
Minister William Gladstone, who led his country for much of the latter
half of the 1800s, was a proponent. And when U.S. President Abraham
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it helped tilt
liberal opinion in Europe toward the Union and away from the
Confederacy. It was not, however, until World War I that the full
democratic peace proposition became central to foreign policy. Wilson's
war message in April 1917---in which he declared that the battle between
autocracies and democracies would establish "the principles of peace and
justice"---was the clarion call. The clash between democracy and
autocracy continued to shape policy as the decades went on. The behavior
of the United States during the Cold War, for example, was often
motivated by a belief that spreading liberal values would yield peace.
As Secretary of State John Foster Dulles declared in his 1953 Senate
confirmation hearing, "We shall never have a secure peace or a happy
world so long as Soviet communism dominates one-third of all the peoples
that there are." President John F. Kennedy echoed that theme in his 1963
speech in West Berlin, declaring that "when all are free, then we can
look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this
country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful
globe." But that same month, in a powerful address at American
University, Kennedy warned of the complementary dangers of ideological
confrontation with the Soviet Union. "Let us not be blind to our
differences---but let us also direct attention to our common interests
and the means by which those differences can be resolved," he said. "If
we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world
safe for diversity." [As liberalism endured and spread, intellectuals
began empirically testing whether democratic peace theory actually held
true.]{.underline} In 1939, the American journalist Clarence Streit
published a qualitative historical analysis to see whether liberal
democracies tended to maintain peace among themselves. Discerning that
the answer was yes, he proposed that the decade's leading democracies
form a federal union, which would help protect them from fascist powers.
In 1972, Dean Babst, building on Quincy Wright's magisterial A Study of
War from 30 years earlier, carried out a statistical analysis that also
suggested a correlation between democracy and peace. In 1976, Melvin
Small and J. David Singer confirmed this finding but demonstrated that
democratic peace was limited to relations between democracies.
Republics, they showed, were still prone to fight autocratic regimes. In
the decades since, [[i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations
[scholars]{.mark} have continued to study the democratic peace
paradigm]{.underline}. [They [have shown that the relationship between
democracy and peace is statistically significant even when controlling
for proximity, wealth, and trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. They have
determined that the theory holds even when states attempt to constrain
each other. Academics have advanced a wide variety of explanations for
why the concept is so sturdy. Some have argued that part of the reason
lies in the disproportionate influence that international institutions
have with liberal countries. [Research shows that democracies tend to
delegate]{.underline} a lot of [policymaking to complex multilateral
bodies]{.underline}, such as the European Union and the World Trade
Organization, in part because their leaders can use these groups to
entrench policies before cycling out of office. Other scholars have
argued that [[liberal norms favoring peace]{.underline}]{.mark}, human
rights, and respect for fellow democracies [[hold sway over policymakers
and publics]{.underline}]{.mark}. And still [others have pointed to the
benefits of trade]{.underline} and economic interdependence associated
with relations [among capitalist democracies]{.underline}. States that
frequently trade, after all, will lose wealth if they fight one another.

### Democracy Alt Cause---1NC

#### Trump is actively destroying democracy and the rule of law

assault on the rule of law]{.mark}]{.underline}"

wtk

[[Trump]{.mark} has]{.underline} done more than that -- he has
[[opened]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[Pandora's box]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that might, in time, give the chief justice pause. [The president
has]{.underline} indicated that he has [another target]{.underline} in
his sights: [the]{.underline} very [judiciary]{.underline} over which
Roberts presides.

"He who saves his Country does not violate any law," Trump posted on
Musk's X earlier this month, channeling Napoleon Bonaparte. The comment,
combined with overt threats that Trump and his people have made against
judges who dare stand in their way, have prompted a question that
previously would have been unthinkable: is the president willing to defy
the rule of law itself?

"We've seen the many ways in which [[Trump]{.mark} has sought to
[undermine]{.mark} Congress]{.underline}, [and now he's
seeking]{.underline} to undermine [[the judicial
bench]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard law school
professor. "[This is a president who is arrogating to himself the powers
of a dictator]{.underline}."

For 17 years, until she retired in 2011, Gertner sat as a federal judge
in the district court of Massachusetts. There she dealt with the
defiance of individual defendants.

"I had people who had been sentenced and didn't follow the rules of
their release, for sure," she said.

Not once in almost two decades of service, however, did she have to
confront a public officeholder openly flouting her authority.
"Governmental officials defying the court? It never came up. Literally,
never happened."

Now Gertner is observing [[Trump's belligerence towards the
courts]{.underline} [unfold]{.underline}]{.mark} with mounting concern.
"**[[There's been nothing like this in American
history]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There have been people who threatened
not to obey the law, especially post the civil war, but [[this is
a]{.underline} **[sustained attack on the courts]{.underline}**]{.mark}
we haven't seen before."

### Democracy Alt Cause---2NC

#### He is using small boosts in popularity to dismantle US institutions

**Evans-Pritchard 25**, World Economy Editor of The Daily Telegraph.
(Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, 6-19-2025, "[[We are witnessing the death of
American democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}"
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/06/19/we-are-witnessing-the-death-of-american-democracy/)
wtk

[What]{.underline} Donald [[Trump]{.mark} has done by
[activating]{.mark} the]{.underline} California [[National Guard against
the protest of the governor, and]{.mark} then [bringing in]{.mark} US
[Marines]{.mark}]{.underline} -- both of which his critics argue are
unconstitutional -- [is]{.underline} a very light version of
Preußenschlag, but in some ways it is [worse]{.underline}. The street
protests in Los Angeles were the result of his own theatrical stunt. You
could be forgiven for thinking he deliberately provoked the alleged
"rebellion" in order to set this precedent.

One can see now why Trump moved so fast to purge the top echelons of the
US defence department, including the three judge advocates general.
These officials rule on whether military orders are legal, and when they
should be disobeyed. They are legally independent by Congressional
statute.

Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, told us why they had been sacked:
it was to stop them posing any "roadblocks to orders given by the
commander-in-chief".

Did [Trump]{.underline} mean it when he [[told his generals to]{.mark}
"just [shoot]{.mark}" American [protesters]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the Black Lives Matter riots in 2020? We may find out.

[He]{.underline} also [[fired the chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff]{.underline}]{.mark} and others deemed symbols of "diversity,
equity, and inclusion", although one might suspect another motive.

An earlier chairman -- General Mark Milley -- refused to ratify the
Putsch of Jan 6 2021, and therefore stopped it stone dead. "We don't
take an oath to a king, or to a tyrant or dictator. We take an oath to
the Constitution," he said.

[Trump is attacking California on several fronts at once]{.underline},
shrewdly [judging that]{.underline} Governor Gavin [Newsom is the
perfect foil]{.underline}. He is stripping the state of its powers under
the Clean Power Act to impose tougher pollution rules than federal
levels. He has signed an order blocking California's plan to phase out
petrol cars by 2035, and another stopping it capping nitrogen oxide
emissions. He now is threatening to withhold federal disaster aid for
wildfires.

Trump called him "Governor Newscum" and added in his inimitable style:
"You know, hatred is never a good thing in politics. When you don't like
somebody, you don't respect somebody, it's harder for that person to get
money if you're on top."

Forgive me for sounding jaundiced, but decades ago I covered the
Republican crusade under Speaker Newt Gingrich to restore states rights
and check the usurpations of federal power. Gingrich and his party are
now egging on the federal military occupation of states that stand in
Trump's way.

James Carville, veteran Democratic strategist and Clinton-fixer, says
the Democrats should bide their time and "play possum", betting that
Trump will self-destruct under the contradictions of his own policies.
The bond markets will do the job for them. Congress will drop back into
Democrat hands like a ripe fruit in the 2026 mid-terms.

I never expected to find myself impugning the ruthless Mr Carville for
credulous naivety. Declaration of interest: he once carried out a black
ops campaign against me personally from an office in the White House,
which I no doubt deserved, all is forgiven anyway.

Playing possum is what the German Social Democrats did in the early
1930s. Reading the first two volumes of Sir Richard Evans's magisterial
trilogy, The Coming of the Third Reich and The Third Reich in Power, I
am struck again and again by the refusal of the moderate middle to face
up to what was happening. They had a touching faith that the courts
would save them.

But the judges were ideologically captured, or frightened, or did what
most human beings do in turbulent times: they pre-emptively adapted to
keep their families out of trouble.

The Social Democrats made another fatal error. They assumed that
Hitler's eccentric mish-mash of economic policies would lead quickly to
a crisis, greatly underestimating the lift from neo-Keynesian
rearmament, so like Trump's gargantuan deficits.

American democracy has much deeper roots but [[the imminent bombing of
Iran by the US air force gives pause for thought]{.underline}]{.mark}.
There may be excellent reasons to knock out Iran's nuclear capability,
though doing in this way, flippantly, like a power-drunk despot,
conflating non-proliferation with regime change, drives the final nail
in the coffin of Western moral credibility.

That said, polls suggest that almost 80pc of [[Americans would applaud
the destruction of the Fordow nuclear site]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
most would support cutting off the head of the serpent in Tehran. [Trump
might face a Maga revolt on the edges but [the]{.mark} larger [bounce in
popularity would let him steam roll opposition to his tariff war, his
climate war, and his "beautiful big bill"]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a
giant transfer of income from poor to rich. I don't believe Steven
Bannon's warning that intervention will "tear the country apart", unless
the bombing mission goes awry.

[[The strongman glow will open the window further for Trump's takeover
of the deep state]{.underline}. [He has already fired the heads of the
FBI's intelligence, counterterrorism, criminal
investigations]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as the heads of the
Washington and New York offices. He has purged the justice department,
now run by a Lord High Executioner from The Mikado, openly touting an
enemies list of "conspirators". He has forced private law firms to bend
the knee.

[[He has put in a loyalist in charge of the CIA]{.underline}]{.mark},
who inconveniently reported in March that Iran was not building a
nuclear weapon. But that was then, when Trump stood for America First,
and staying out of forever wars was policy. He has fired the head of the
eaves-dropping National Security Agency and its top officials. He has
purged the head of the Federal Trade Commission, who is independent by
law, like the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

[America in 2025]{.underline} is obviously not Germany in 1932. The
Weimar republic was already a cauldron of political violence. That year
was the worst of the Great Depression. The country was seething with
rage over the cultivated myths of the 1918 "stab in the back" and the
Carthaginian peace of Versailles.

It is even less like Germany in 1933 when the Nazis used their three
cabinet seats to take over the Prussian and federal interior ministries.
Within five months the Social Democrats leadership was dead, or in
Dachau, or in exile. All rival parties were shut down. No independent
newspaper survived. Every organisation from the labour unions, to male
choirs, sports teams and beekeeper clubs came under Nazi control.

But it [is not the same America]{.underline} that was my home for long
stretches [of the late 20th century]{.underline}. [[Over the last few
days alone]{.mark}: [a Democratic]{.mark} US [senator was manhandled to
the floor]{.mark}, handcuffed and dragged away for asking a question;
[the]{.mark} Democrat [comptroller of New York was seized]{.mark} and
handcuffed by masked federal agents after demanding to see a judicial
warrant; [a Democratic state legislator in Minnesota was
murdered]{.mark} with her husband at home, and a state senator was shot
and badly wounded, both by an assassin with a hit list of 45
officials.]{.underline}

Judges have so far issued more than 60 rulings that curb or restrain
Trump's legal overreach. A shocking number have either been threatened,
directly or through their families, or face calls for impeachment.

"[[Our constitutional system depends on judges who can make decisions
free from threats and intimidation]{.underline},"]{.mark} warned judge
Robert Conrad, director of the administrative office of the US courts,
in testimony to Congress. To no avail: the House judiciary committee
shrugged it off, more or less blaming the victims.

[[The drift of events was disturbing]{.mark} even before Iran offered
Trump a fresh gift from Mars. I fear that [many more lines in the sand
will be crossed]{.mark} in the heady aftermath of a surgical video war
on the Ayatollah, if that is where we are headed.]{.underline}

#### Checks and balances fail---he'll force a legitimacy crisis

Ali Kanu, 1-31-2025, "The Trump Administration Will Truly Test the
Supreme Court"
https://prospect.org/justice/2025-01-31-trump-administration-test-supreme-court-tiktok/)
wtk

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. Supreme [[Court
will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[undergo]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}n even **[[greater institutional stress
test]{.underline}]{.mark}** [during]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump's second term.]{.underline} Trump's reaction to the recently
concluded Supreme Court case about ownership of the social media giant
[TikTok has been particularly telling]{.underline} on this point.

The suit by TikTok challenged a law enacted last year that banned the
app from operating in the U.S. unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sold
it to a non-Chinese buyer within 270 days. Lawmakers have said the
policy is necessary because China is a "foreign adversary," and due to
(classified) national-security concerns stemming from TikTok's routine
collection of Americans' personal data, including from government
workers and officials.

[The companies]{.underline} ultimately [lost the case]{.underline}, and
the Supreme Court issued a January 17 ruling upholding the law---which
meant that as of the January 19 deadline, it became illegal for TikTok
to continue operations, and illegal for other companies to work with
them.

[Yet]{.underline}, as things stand, [[Trump]{.mark} has]{.underline}
effectively [[instructed a private company to **break federal
laws**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} to [violate a
fresh-off-the-press Supreme Court order]{.underline}. "It's basically
saying, there is a law that has passed that I don't think should be a
law, and therefore my enforcers will not enforce it," said Zephyr
Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University and a former antitrust
enforcer at the New York attorney general's office, on a recent episode
of the Organized Money podcast.

Trump and the company telegraphed their intentions quite openly and
plainly, in worldwide press releases. And, as of today, the president
and his collaborators have carried out their plans, flouting Congress's
law and the Supreme Court's order daily, in the most public manner
possible, and apparently with total impunity.

Perhaps just as important, no one is even raising questions about what
it means for the president to summarily overrule the justices, or
whether the Court can or should have an opportunity to react. With other
challenges to Trump actions sure to move through the court system, it's
an ominous sign for the Court's legitimacy and its practical powers,
even before you get to other questions about our traditional "separation
of powers."

THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF TRUMP'S second presidency have been
characterized by a series of unprecedented exercises of power, and an
equally extraordinary attempt to arrogate even more powers to the
office---and in the individual executive himself---not seen during any
other administration in recent memory.

[[The admin]{.mark}istration [has tried to freeze]{.mark} trillions in
[government grant money]{.mark}; [fired]{.mark} and suspended hundreds
of government [workers]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [trying to terminate
as many as 200,000]{.underline} in total; [[pardoned]{.mark}
[supporters]{.mark} who were convicted of conspiring against the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and attacking the seat of
government; [[rolled]{.mark} [back]{.mark}]{.underline} long-standing
[[civil rights]{.mark} protections]{.underline}; and sought to change
the Constitution's post--Civil War citizenship amendment in order to
enable mass deportations.

And [the White House has undertaken these massive policy
changes]{.underline} largely **[unilaterally]{.underline}**, by
executive order. [Trump]{.underline} himself has candidly
[admitted]{.underline} that some of [the moves appear
unconstitutional]{.underline}, that the administration fully expects
lawsuits, and that their arguments will hopefully fall on kind ears at
the Court.

Here's how Trump responded last Monday when reporters asked about
whether the birthright citizenship order is unconstitutional (as a
federal judge held shortly afterward), for example:

"Could be. I think we have good grounds, but you could be right," Trump
said, according to a report by The Washington Post. "We'll find out ...
People have wanted to do this for decades."

No one is even raising questions about what it means for the president
to summarily overrule the justices.

Many of the major policy changes are expected to end up before the
justices. Courts have already blocked some of the central policies,
including a conservative-appointed judge who remarked that the
citizenship order was perhaps the most "blatantly unconstitutional"
executive action he'd reviewed in more than four decades. The order to
freeze federal spending was issued Monday night, challenged in federal
court on Tuesday morning, blocked by the judge that afternoon, and was
rescinded by the administration less than 24 hours later.

Meanwhile, administration officials have continued arguing that Trump
has a mandate to implement whatever policies he sees fit, pointing to
the simple fact that he won the election.

The president's attorneys neatly summed up his stance upon taking office
in a legal brief to the justices in the TikTok case, describing Trump in
very intentional, highly unusual terms, as "the incoming embodiment of
the Executive Branch."

Although that case has concluded, the truly [remarkable
developments]{.underline} since then [indicate that [the Supreme
Court's]{.mark} [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} in the eyes of the
public---and many public officials---[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
**[[continue to plummet]{.mark}, and [the Court will be assailed, from
all sides]{.mark}, over the next four years.]{.underline}**

### No Authoritarianism !---1NC 

#### Authoritarianism isn't an existential threat -- their evidence misunderstands modern autocracies -- empirical data shows that economics and international relations constrains illiberal regimes

Science at UCLA\], The Conversation, "Autocrats don't act like Hitler or

President Donald Trump's critics often accuse him of harboring
authoritarian ambitions. Journalists and scholars have drawn parallels
between his leadership style and that of strongmen abroad. Some
Democrats warn that the U.S. is sliding toward autocracy -- a system in
which one leader holds unchecked power. Others counter that labeling
Trump an autocrat is alarmist. After all, he hasn't suspended the
Constitution, forced school children to memorize his sayings or executed
his rivals, as dictators such as Augusto Pinochet, Mao Zedong and Saddam
Hussein once did. But [[modern autocrats don't]{.mark} always [resemble
their]{.mark} 20th-century [predecessors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead,
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} project a polished image, [[avoid overt
violence and speak the language of democracy]{.underline}.]{.mark} They
wear suits, hold elections and talk about the will of the people. Rather
than terrorizing citizens, many use media control and messaging to shape
public opinion and promote nationalist narratives. Many gain power not
through military coups but at the ballot box. In the early 2000s,
political scientist Andreas Schedler coined the term "electoral
authoritarianism" to describe regimes that hold elections without real
competition. Scholars Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way use another phrase,
"competitive authoritarianism," for systems in which opposition parties
exist but leaders undermine them through censorship, electoral fraud or
legal manipulation. In my own work with economist Sergei Guriev, we
explore a broader strategy that modern autocrats use to gain and
maintain power. We call this "informational autocracy" or "[spin
dictatorship."]{.underline} These leaders [don't rely on violent
repression]{.underline}. Instead, they craft the illusion that they are
competent, democratic defenders of the nation -- protecting it from
foreign threats or internal enemies who seek to undermine its culture or
steal its wealth. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor [Orbán exemplifies
this approach.]{.underline} He first served from 1998 to 2002, returned
to power in 2010 and has since won three more elections -- in 2014, 2018
and 2022 -- after campaigns that international observers criticized as
"intimidating and xenophobic." [[Orbán]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[preserved the formal structures of democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} --
courts, a parliament and regular elections -- [but]{.underline} has
[systematically hollowed them out]{.underline}. In his first two years
he packed Hungary's constitutional court, which reviews laws for
constitutionality, with loyalists, forced judges off the bench by
mandating a lower retirement age and rewrote the constitution to limit
judicial review of his actions. He also tightened government control
over independent media. To boost his image, Orbán funneled state
advertising funds to friendly news outlets. In 2016, an ally bought
Hungary's largest opposition newspaper -- then shut it down. Orbán has
also targeted advocacy groups and universities. The Central European
University, which was registered in both Budapest and the U.S., was once
a symbol of the new democratic Hungary. But a law penalizing
foreign-accredited institutions forced it to relocate to Vienna in 2020.
Yet [Orbán has mostly avoided violence]{.underline}. Journalists are
harassed rather than jailed or killed. Critics are discredited for their
beliefs but not abducted. His appeal rests on a narrative that Hungary
is under siege -- by immigrants, liberal elites and foreign influences
-- and that only he can defend its sovereignty and Christian identity.
That message resonates with older, rural, conservative voters, even as
it alienates younger, urban populations. In recent decades[, [variants
of spin dictatorship have]{.mark}]{.underline} appeared in Singapore,
Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Leaders such as
Hugo Chávez and the early Vladimir Putin [[consolidated power and
marginalized opposition with minimal violence. Data confirm this
trend]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drawing from human rights reports,
historical records and local media, my colleague Sergei Guriev and I
found that **[[the global incidence of political killings and
imprisonments]{.mark} by autocrats [dropped significantly]{.mark} from
the 1980s to the 2010s]{.underline}**. Why? [In an interconnected world,
**overt repression has costs**.]{.underline} [[Attacking
journalists]{.mark} and dissidents [can prompt]{.mark} foreign
governments to impose economic [sanctions]{.mark} [and
discourage]{.mark} international companies from
[investing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Curbing free expression risks stifling
scientific and technological innovation -- something even autocrats need
in modern, knowledge-based economies]{.underline}. Still, when crises
erupt, even spin dictators often revert to more traditional tactics.
Russia's Putin has cracked down violently on protesters and jailed
opposition leaders. Meanwhile, more brutal regimes such as those in
North Korea and China continue to rule by spreading fear, combining mass
incarceration with advanced surveillance technologies. But
[overall]{.underline}, [[spin is replacing terror]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### No Authoritarianism !---2NC 

#### Autocracies aren't more war prone

Rustam **Seerat**, 3/11/**23**, Medium, "The upcoming era of autocratic
peace,"
https://medium.com/kabul-dairies/the-upcoming-era-of-autocratic-peace-d3abbbcb7f7e,

In international relations scholarship, a widely-known theory is called
the democratic peace theory. The democratic peace theory in
international relations suggests that democracies are less likely to go
to war with each other. This theory asserts that because democracies are
characterized by a commitment to individual rights and a system of
checks and balances, they are less likely to behave aggressively toward
other democracies. The theory argues that democratic countries share
common values, norms, and institutions and are more likely to resolve
disputes through peaceful means such as negotiation, mediation, or
arbitration. Additionally, democratic leaders are said to be more
accountable to their citizens, who are more likely to resist war and
support diplomatic solutions to conflicts. There is also a lesser-known
theory called the autocratic peace theory. The [autocratic peace
theory]{.underline} in international relations [proposes
that]{.underline} autocratic regimes or [[authoritarian governments are
less likely to engage in war with each other]{.mark} compared to
democracies]{.underline}. [This theory suggests that [authoritarian
leaders are more interested in maintaining power and stability]{.mark}
within their countries [rather than expanding their influence]{.mark}
through military aggression]{.underline}. The autocratic peace theory
argues that [[autocracies are more capable of controlling]{.mark} their
[societies]{.mark} and suppressing internal dissent, [which
reduces]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} internal [conflict]{.mark}
and makes it easier to avoid external conflict]{.underline}.
Additionally, [[autocratic]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark} are said to have
less accountability to their citizens, which allows them to
[make]{.mark} unpopular [decisions]{.mark}, such [as pursuing diplomacy
instead of war]{.mark}, without fear of losing power]{.underline}. The
expansion of NATO and the EU to Ukraine that triggered the Russian
invasion is ingrained with the notion of democratic peace. The argument
goes, if we bring democracies to the countries around the world, then we
will not have to go to war with them. Hence, we should prop up
democracies and support democratic governments. The evidence for the
democratic peace theory is strong. For example, we can see that
democracies in the Global North (North America, Europe, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, and Australia) are significantly less likely to go
to war with one another. On the other hand, autocratic regimes go to war
with one another but less often. The Sino-Soviet border conflict of 1969
is one example; another example is the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.
Nevertheless, [autocratic regimes do seem to develop more amicable
relationships than authoritarian and democratic regimes]{.underline}.
[In recent years]{.underline}, especially after the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, **[[the glue in the relationship among autocracies has
significantly increased]{.mark}.]{.underline}** China is getting more
cheap oil and gas from Russia, and Russia receives "non-lethal
assistance" from China. Iran is selling military drones to Russia. But
the pivoting in the relationship between China and Saudi Arabia is more
noteworthy. Traditionally, Saudi Arabia was seen as a puppet of the US
in its foreign policy, which seems to be changing. Saudi Arabia
eliminated the dollar from its oil trade with China as a means of
exchange and replaced it with Yuan. The Iraqi cabinet voted for the
same, replacing the dollar with the yuan. Another shift is China playing
the mediator role between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Seven years ago, they
severed their diplomatic ties and decided to restore them due to an
agreement brokered by the Chinese among them recently. [The upcoming
autocratic peace is a byproduct of the return of China to the club of
great world powers.]{.underline} [[A world with China as the leading
power is attractive for all autocratic regimes
worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}. China would not question human rights
violations, dealing with marginalized ethnic groups, gender disparity,
etc., in countries with authoritarian regimes --- treating them as
internal matters. The problem with the US-dominated world for autocrats
is that it sometimes uses human rights violations, women's oppression,
and the rights of minority groups to pressure its adversaries. For
instance, The US points out Iran's human rights violations more often
than when it is committed by Saudi Arabia, which is worse. The US not
only ignores what Saudi Arabia is doing in Yemen, but it also helps it.
In contrast, China does not support one autocrat against another; its
stance is more like, "Hey guys, work out your differences so that it
does not disrupt trade."

#### The premise of the impact is false -- democracies are not inherently more peaceful than autocracies

Robert **Skidelsky**, 9/5/**22**, \[Skidelsky is a member of the British
House of Lords and Professor Emeritus of Political Economy at Warwick
University\], International Politics and Society (Journal), "The false
promise of democratic peace,"
https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/democracy-and-society/the-false-promise-of-democratic-peace-5915/,
mm

Through persuasion, exhortation, legal processes, economic pressure, and
sometimes military force, American foreign policy asserts the United
States' view about how the world should be run. Only two countries in
recent history have had such world-transforming ambitions: Britain and
the US. In the last 150 years, these are the only two countries whose
power -- hard and soft, formal and informal -- has extended to all parts
of the world, allowing them plausibly to aspire to the mantle of Rome.
When the US inherited Britain's global position after 1945, it also
inherited Britain's sense of responsibility for the future of the
international order. Embracing that role, America has been an evangelist
of democracy, and a central US foreign-policy objective since the fall
of communism has been to promote its spread -- sometimes by regime
change, when that is deemed necessary. In fact, this playbook dates back
to US President Woodrow Wilson's time. As historian Nicholas Mulder
writes in The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern
War, 'Wilson was the first statesman to cast the economic weapon as an
instrument of democratization. He thereby added an internal political
rationale for economic sanctions -- spreading democracy -- to the
external political goal that...European advocates of sanctions have
aimed at: inter-state peace.' The implication is that, where the
opportunity offers, military and non-military measures should be used to
topple 'malign' regimes. [According to [democratic peace theory]{.mark},
democracies do not start wars; only dictatorships do.]{.underline} A
wholly democratic world thus would be a world without war. This was the
hope that emerged in the 1990s. With the end of communism, the
expectation, famously expressed by Francis Fukuyama's 1989 article, 'The
End of History?,' was that the most important parts of the world would
become democratic. US supremacy was supposed to ensure that democracy
became the universal political norm. But Russia and China, the leading
communist states of the Cold War era, have not embraced it; nor have
many other centres of world affairs, especially in the Middle East.
Hence, Fukuyama has recently acknowledged that if Russia and China were
driven together, 'then you would really be living in a world that was
being dominated by these non-democratic powers...\[which\] really is the
end of the end of history.' The argument that democracy is inherently
'peaceful,' and dictatorship or autocracy 'warlike,' is intuitively
attractive. It does not deny that states pursue their own interests; but
it assumes that the interests of democratic states will reflect common
values like human rights, and that those interests will be pursued in a
less bellicose manner (since democratic processes require negotiation of
differences). Democratic governments are accountable to their people,
and the people have an interest in peace, not war. By contrast,
according to this view, rulers and elites in dictatorships are
illegitimate and therefore insecure, which leads them to seek popular
support by whipping up animosity toward foreigners. If democracy
replaced dictatorship everywhere, world peace would follow
automatically. [This belief rests on two propositions]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} have been extremely influential in international
relations theory, even though they **[[are poorly grounded theoretically
and empirically]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The first is [the notion that a
state's external behaviour is determined by its domestic
constitution]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [a view that [ignores the influence
the international system can have]{.mark} on a country's domestic
politics]{.underline}. As the American political scientist Kenneth N.
Waltz argued in his 1979 book, The Theory of International Politics,
'international anarchy' conditions the behaviour of states more than the
behaviour of states creates international anarchy. Waltz's
'world-systems theory' perspective is particularly useful in an age of
globalisation. [[One must look to the structure of the international
system]{.mark} to 'predict' how individual states will
behave]{.underline}, regardless of their domestic constitutions. 'If
each state, being stable, strove only for security, and had no designs
on its neighbours, all states would nevertheless remain insecure,' he
observed, 'for the means of security for one state are, in their very
existence, the means by which other states are threatened.' Waltz
offered a bracing antidote to the facile assumption that democratic
habits are easily transferable from one location to another. Rather than
trying to spread democracy, he suggested that it would be better to try
to reduce global insecurity. [[Though there is]{.underline}]{.mark}
undeniably [[some correlation]{.underline} [between democratic
institutions and peaceful habits]{.underline}, **[the direction of
causation is disputable]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Was it
democracy that made Europe peaceful after 1945? Or did the US nuclear
umbrella, the fixing of borders by the victors, and Marshall
Plan-fuelled economic growth finally make it possible for non-communist
Europe to accept democracy as its political norm? The political
scientist Mark E. Pietrzyk contends that, '[[Only states which are
relatively secure]{.mark}]{.underline} -- politically, militarily,
economically [-- [can afford to have free]{.mark}, pluralistic
[societies]{.mark}; in the absence of this security, states are much
more]{.underline} likely [to adopt]{.underline}, maintain, or revert to
centralised, [coercive]{.underline} authority [structures]{.underline}.'
[[The second proposition is that democracy is the natural form of the
state]{.mark},]{.underline} which people everywhere will spontaneously
adopt if allowed to. [[This dubious assumption]{.underline}]{.mark}
makes regime change seem easy, because the sanctioning powers can rely
on the welcoming support of those whose freedom has been repressed and
whose rights have been trampled underfoot. By drawing superficial
comparisons with post-war Germany and Japan, the apostles of
democratisation [[grossly underestimate the difficulties of installing
democracies in societies that lack Western constitutional
traditions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The results of their handiwork can be
seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and many African countries.
[Democratic peace theory is, above all, lazy]{.underline}. [It provides
an easy explanation for 'warlike' behaviour without considering the
location and history of the states involved]{.underline}. This
shallowness lends itself to overconfidence that a quick dose of economic
sanctions or bombing is all that is needed to cure a dictatorship of its
unfortunate affliction. In short, the idea that democracy is 'portable'
leads to a gross underestimation of the military, economic, and
humanitarian costs of trying to spread democracy to troubled parts of
the world. The West has paid a terrible price for such thinking -- and
it may be about to pay again.

This alternative approach raises questions about political legitimacy as
well. [Western commentators often claim that Chinese people support
their government only out of fear]{.underline}. But
[research]{.underline} like the Anthropology of Democracy (AoD) project
--- recently shared by Jason Hickel --- [challenges that
assumptio]{.underline}n. Using anonymised, bias-reducing survey methods,
the study finds that [[Chinese citizens express exceptionally high
levels of satisfaction with]{.mark} their [government]{.mark} and its
responsiveness]{.underline}. [[If fear alone were the driver, we'd
expect similar results in other authoritarian states]{.underline} ---
**[but we don't]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For example, only 50% of
Russians in the same survey said they believed their country was
democratic.

[Many people struggle with the idea that China could be seen as
democratic at all]{.underline}. [But this rests on a narrow, [Western
definition of democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} --- one [that [focuses
exclusively on]{.mark} multi-party [elections]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, [[frames its system as

in]{.underline} a unique party system and democratic centralism, [local

institutionalise responsiveness to popular needs.

Whether or not one agrees with that framework, what matters is how it
functions in the eyes of the people. [In much of the West, citizens
increasingly feel alienated from political institutions and
disillusioned with the ability of electoral systems to deliver
meaningful change.]{.underline} [[In China, people **overwhelmingly

In today's conditions, [**[pulling back]{.mark}** from Europe and the
Middle East [would **exacerbate violent
instability**]{.mark}]{.underline} in those regions, [**[raising the
odds]{.mark}** that [America must **return later**]{.mark} and [under
**worse conditions**]{.mark}. [And America **would** have to
return]{.mark}, because those regions **still matter greatly**. [Europe
has **real economic heft**]{.mark} and **still contains** the world's
**largest concentration** of **liberal democracies**]{.underline}; [[the
Middle East commands **vital energy resources**]{.mark}, **[strategic

### LIO Turn---US Key to LIO

**Defense is [wrong]{.underline}. The [convergence]{.underline} of
adversaries [magnifies]{.underline} the threat** **AND
[furthers]{.underline} the necessity of [strong US
leadership]{.underline} to rebuke it.**

The [most dangerous geopolitical phenomenon of our era
isn't]{.underline} **[any single crisis]{.underline}**, conflict or
competitor. [It is the]{.underline} **[growing web of
ties]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[bind]{.underline}** [America's
Eurasian foes]{.underline}.

Eurasia --- the supercontinent encompassing Europe, Asia and their
outlying islands --- is the world's strategic center, where most of its
people and economic potential reside. An empire that ruled Eurasia could
project its influence across the adjoining oceans and around the world.

All the epic clashes of the 20th century --- World War I, World War II,
the Cold War --- were contests between autocracies seeking vast Eurasian
empires and the global coalitions that fought to turn them back. Today,
a [new league of authoritarian leaders is]{.underline}
**[reviving]{.underline}** [this deadly pattern]{.underline}.
**[[Revisionist]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- that is to say, violently
dissatisfied --- [**[powers]{.underline}** [are locking
arms]{.underline}]{.mark} [and thrusting the world into the]{.underline}
**[next round]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the great Eurasian
[struggle that has shaped the modern age]{.underline}. Unfortunately,
the United States is not ready for the challenge.

The history of the modern era was foretold when it was just beginning.
In 1904, British scholar Halford Mackinder explained in a landmark
lecture how geography, technology and ideology were combining to ignite
an explosive Eurasian century.

He argued that the proliferation of railroads was shrinking Eurasia,
allowing ambitious states to shuttle huge armies across the landmass.
The end of the easy colonial expansion of the 19th century was turning
the great powers against one another in the 20th. Politics and
geopolitics were also interacting combustively: Tyrants now ruled modern
industrial economies, which would turbo-charge repression and conquest.

All these developments, Mackinder foresaw, would lead to titanic
battles. [[A]{.underline}]{.mark} country or
**[[coalition]{.underline}]{.mark}** that mastered Eurasia [[would
become a]{.underline} **[global menace]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [for
[it]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[possess the power to make even
the]{.underline} **[most distant]{.underline}** [democracies
insecure]{.underline}]{.mark}. So, **[aspiring]{.underline}** conquerors
would **[lunge]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} Eurasian [hegemony,
while]{.underline} offshore powers --- and the **[vulnerable
states]{.underline}** situated along Eurasia's edges --- [would fight to
preserve their freedoms]{.underline} by keeping the supercontinent
divided.

This was as good a guide as any to what followed. In World War I, a
militaristic, illiberal Germany sought to dominate Europe from the North
Sea to the Caucasus, creating a resource-rich empire and a springboard
to global power. It took a transoceanic coalition anchored by Britain
and the United States to beat the Germans back. In World War II, the
fascist powers racked up victories from the Atlantic coast of France to
the Central Pacific. An even grander coalition --- the United States,
Britain, the Soviet Union, China --- was required to rescue humanity
from a new dark age. During the Cold War, a communist bloc led by Moscow
dominated the heart of Eurasia and sought to press outward against a
free world led by Washington.

These contests claimed tens of millions of lives, showing how aggression
and atrocity could radiate outward from conquered continents. They also
demonstrated that the cycle of Eurasian conflict could be broken only by
the United States.

This distant superpower helped defeat two wartime bids for Eurasian
hegemony. During the Cold War, it preserved a favorable balance within
the supercontinent by erecting the alliances --- NATO and several
security pacts in the Western Pacific --- that secured its economically
dynamic flanks. These partnerships enabled democracy to thrive and the
free-world economy to flourish, and they formed the foundation upon
which the liberal world order was built. By the 1990s, the Western
victory over the Soviet Union had inaugurated a post-Cold War era of
great-power peace and democratic dominance. But dreams of autocratic
empire are now reviving, and a second Eurasian century has begun.

In Northeast Asia, North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is building up his
nuclear and missile arsenals in hopes of driving America from the Korean
Peninsula. In the Middle East, Iran and its proxies are fighting the
United States and Israel over the region's future. In Europe, Russian
President Vladimir Putin is waging a quasi-genocidal war to rebuild the
Russian empire --- with an assist from North Korean troops. China is
racing to prepare for war with Washington and making its push for
primacy in the Western Pacific.

[Each of [these countries aim]{.mark}s [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[overturn the existing order]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in]{.underline}
**[key regions]{.underline}** [around the]{.underline} Eurasian
[periphery]{.underline}. Each [[sees]{.underline}
**[U.S.]{.underline}**]{.mark} power and [**[liberal
values]{.underline}** [as its greatest foes]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
[what makes the]{.underline} **[current moment]{.underline}**
[so]{.underline} **[precarious]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} that
[these aggressive powers are making common cause]{.underline}.

[**[China]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**
[announced their]{.underline} **["no limits"]{.underline}** [strategic
partnership]{.underline}]{.mark} just before Moscow launched its
full-scale invasion of Ukraine. They mean, in Chinese President Xi
Jinping's words, to revolutionize the international system by causing
"changes the likes of which we haven't seen for 100 years." Since that
invasion, [**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth [**[Ko]{.underline}**r]{.mark}ea have
[[sealed a formal military alliance]{.underline};
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark} have [[built a stronger defense
partnership]{.underline}]{.mark} in which technology, weapons and
know-how flow both ways. And since Oct. 7, 2023, Russia has provided
targeting data and other assistance to the Houthis in Yemen, who have
also acquired missiles and other means of mayhem from Tehran. Most of
[these [relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} aren't new, but all
[have]{.underline} [**[grown rapidly]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}
**[hothouse global environment]{.underline}** [created by
wars]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}**
[and the]{.underline} **[Mid]{.underline}**dle **[East]{.underline}**.

To be sure, there is no overarching multilateral alliance --- no
autocrats' NATO. Mistrust among the illiberal powers remains pervasive.
But [[their relationships constitute a]{.underline} **[cohering network
of ties]{.underline}** [among states that are determined to]{.underline}
**[wreck]{.underline}** [Pax Americana]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
command]{.underline} some of [the most valuable strategic real estate on
Earth]{.underline}. Western [observers]{.underline} **[play
down]{.underline}** [the autocrats' pacts at their peril, because some
of history's greatest cataclysms have been caused by]{.underline}
**[dysfunctional --- yet]{.underline}** profoundly
**[destructive]{.underline}** --- [alliances]{.underline}.

Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan never could have
coexisted in the long run. But before World War II, their cooperation
delivered devastating multiplier effects by destabilizing governments on
several fronts at once. During the early Cold War, a wary alliance
between Moscow and Beijing intensified the threats facing the free
world. And whether the new autocratic pacts are love matches or
marriages of convenience, they are having serious strategic effects.

For one thing, these relationships encourage aggression by reducing its
costs: A heavily sanctioned Russia has been able to continue its war in
Ukraine thanks to the missiles, artillery shells, drones and troops it
has received from Tehran and Pyongyang, and the economic succor it has
gotten from Beijing. Likewise, the pacts increase the danger of war on
some fronts by pacifying others: Putin can go all-out against Ukraine
because he faces no threat from China, just as Xi can be bolder in the
Pacific because he has a friendly Russia at his back. An autocratic
peace within Eurasia encourages violent meddling around its margins.

Autocratic relationships also weaken Western pressure on individual
regimes: Russia now shields Pyongyang from sanctions, while Tehran and
Moscow develop illicit trade networks beyond U.S. reach. These
relationships divide U.S. attention by creating trouble in several
places at once. Witness Washington's agonizing debates over aid for
Ukraine vs. support for Taiwan, over hammering the Houthis vs.
husbanding missiles for a war with China. Perhaps most fundamentally,
autocratic ties are shifting the military balance.

Beijing's record-breaking buildup has long involved purchases of Russian
planes, missiles and air defenses. And Sino-Russian defense cooperation
is only getting deeper and more secretive as the two countries work
together to build submarines, helicopters and other key capabilities.

Across Eurasia, in fact, transnational production networks are emerging:
Iranian-origin drones are being built in Russian defense plants, where
North Korean workers reportedly labor. The autocratic arms trade is
burgeoning, as Russia promises to sell state-of-the-art aircraft, air
defenses and other advanced capabilities to its partners. Disruptive
military innovation is accelerating, as North Korea receives Russian
technology and know-how for its missile and satellite programs. These
countries' militaries are also learning from one another: Iran's missile
and drone attack against Israel in April looked suspiciously similar to
Russia's previous strikes against Ukraine.

[If the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
once [served as the]{.underline} **[arsenal of democracy]{.underline}**,
[a]{.underline} modern-day [[arsenal of autocracy
is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[now]{.underline}** [[taking
shape]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**[Russia]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[China]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea have already [[managed]{.underline}
**[more]{.underline}**]{.mark} defense-technological
[[collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} than the Axis powers of the World
War II era ever did. Even if they never come together in a full-fledged
military alliance, [[they could]{.underline} **[still
deepen]{.underline}**]{.mark} their
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in dangerous ways]{.underline}.

For example, they [could collaborate [on]{.mark}]{.underline} **[more
sensitive]{.underline}** [projects]{.underline}: Russia could
[support]{.underline} North Korea's rapidly improving
[**[nuclear]{.underline}** [program or]{.underline}]{.mark} give Beijing
its most **[[advanced submarine]{.underline}]{.mark}**-quieting
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology. Putin could give the Houthis
anti-ship cruise missiles to make their attacks more lethal. Russia and
China could [[swap insights on how to]{.underline} **[use nuclear
threats]{.underline}**]{.mark} to keep the United States from
interfering [as they]{.underline} **[coerce]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[attack]{.underline}** [their neighbors]{.underline}
--- precisely what Putin has done in Ukraine. Or perhaps [these
countries could find]{.underline} more **[dramatic ways]{.underline}**
[to cooperate in crisis or conflict]{.underline}.

China and Russia are already conducting military drills in potential
conflict zones from the Baltic Sea to the Western Pacific, signaling
that one illiberal power won't sit on the sidelines as Washington fights
another. Russia could aid China in a future conflict against the United
States by conducting cyberattacks that make it harder for America to
mobilize. Or Putin could menace Europe by posturing his forces there
while the Pentagon is preoccupied with a crisis in Asia. If any of this
seems unlikely, just remember that Western observers have repeatedly
been surprised, even shocked, by how far these relationships have
already come.

Meanwhile, [[closer ties among]{.underline} **[U.S.
adversaries]{.underline}** [raise]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [odds that a
war that starts in one place will]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[spill into
others]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Recall that **[World War
II]{.underline}** [began not as a]{.underline} **[global]{.underline}**
[conflict but as a set of]{.underline} **[regional crises]{.underline}**
[that gradually intensified and became inseparable --- just
as]{.underline} the United States' [Eurasian crises are
becoming]{.underline} **[sharper]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[more interwoven]{.underline}**, [today]{.underline}.

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is]{.underline}
still struggling [to]{.underline} **[adapt]{.underline}** [to this
situation]{.underline}. Washington continues to see the world as being
divided into separate regions. This assumption is dangerously outdated.

As the Eurasian axis coheres, [individual crises take on]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** [meaning]{.underline}. [It might be fashionable
to talk about]{.underline} **[pivoting away]{.underline}** from Europe
to focus on China. [But]{.underline} one reason it would be so damaging
if America abandons Ukraine, and Russia defeats it, is that [this would
be a]{.underline} **[victory]{.underline}** [for the]{.underline} larger
**[autocratic coalition]{.underline}** [in its showdown with the
democratic world]{.underline}.

#### China is the [largest threat]{.underline} to the LIO

**Crane and Brands 25**, \*journalist, \*\*Professor of Global Affairs
at the Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins University, and a
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. (\*Brent Crane,
interviewing \*\*Hal Brands, 3-11-2025, "Hal Brands on the Axis of
Autocracies" https://chinabooksreview.com/2025/03/11/hal-brands/) wtk

That brings us to [the]{.underline} so-called "axis of resistance" or
"[axis of autocracies]{.underline}." What is that?

Different people call this thing by different names. Basically what it
refers to [is the thickening web of strategic ties among the states that
are most aggressively challenging the international system]{.underline}.
These relationships date back decades in many cases. But they have grown
and they have flourished in the context of the wars in Ukraine and, more
recently, the Middle East. These [[wars have]{.mark} created a
**hothouse geopolitical environment**. They have [encouraged the
Eurasian autocracies]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [China, Russia, Iran,
North Korea]{.underline} --- [[to forge **closer
ties**]{.underline}]{.mark} [so that they can join together for purposes
of both self-protection and geopolitical predation.]{.underline} And
while these relationships don't look like America's alliances, they have
a bunch of important strategic effects. [[They encourage]{.underline}
**[disruptive military innovation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [They help
Russia sustain its war in Ukraine]{.underline}. [They reduce the
isolation that aggressive states would otherwise face]{.underline}. So
they have a variety of effects, all of which are quite disruptive from
the perspective of the United States and its allies.

What role does China play in this axis?

[[China]{.mark} is the most formidable of the Eurasian
autocracies]{.underline}. [It [poses]{.mark}]{.underline}, in my view,
**[[the greatest threat to the survival of the U.S.-led world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That's true certainly in East Asia, where
the Chinese military challenge is most severe. But [it's true on a
global scale]{.underline} as well. [Look at how [China is trying to make
itself the international economic]{.mark} and technological
[heavyweight]{.mark} of the 21st century]{.underline}. At the same time,
[[China plays a key role in **strengthening the other Eurasian
autocracies**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even though a lot of attention has
rightly been paid to the fact that Iran and North Korea have contributed
weapons (and, in North Korea's case, troops) in support of Russia's war
in Ukraine, [there's no way Putin could have sustained the war for so
long without his economic relationship with China]{.underline}. [China
has helped to rebuild Russia's defense industrial base]{.underline}. It
has provided an outlet for Russian goods. It has become increasingly
intertwined with Russia economically, financially and technologically.
So [China is, by itself, the most formidable of the autocracies, and
also the one that helps intensify the threats the others
pose.]{.underline}

Yet, out of all of these states, China is the one we're most intertwined
with. Trade and peer-to-peer relationships with Chinese companies are
still pretty robust. What's the evidence that China wants to upend the
U.S.-led order from which it benefits so much?

Yes, China is the most intertwined with the existing world order and it
has the most to lose if that order is disrupted. After all, China is
still dependent on the global economy. It's still dependent on
technological inputs from the United States and other Western countries,
although it's trying to reduce that dependence urgently. China has also
not challenged the system as violently as Russia or Iran have in the
last couple of years.

But [[if you look at China's aims, it's hard to reconcile them with the
international system as we know it]{.underline}.]{.mark} [That's true if
you look just at China's territorial claims against its
neighbors]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Greater [[China that
Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[is trying to put together includes
Hong Kong]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} but it
also includes about [[90% of the South China Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}; a
chunk of [[India]{.underline}]{.mark} that's the size of a small
European country; [[and a bunch of other revanchist
aims]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Asian littoral and mainland.

There's also the fact that [China is pretty clearly looking for an
exclusive sphere of influence in East Asia]{.underline} --- "Asia for
Asians," as Xi Jinping called it about a decade ago. Not necessarily one
in which China physically dominates the region, but one in which its
preferences have to be obeyed and cannot be challenged. And one in which
the U.S. is essentially booted to the sidelines of the region.

On a global scale, [[China]{.mark} also [seeks a very different
distribution of power]{.mark}]{.underline}. When Chinese officials or
propagandists talk about China's "great rejuvenation", they are
referring to a situation in which China is once again the most advanced,
most respected, most powerful country in the world as, in the Chinese
narrative, it was for many, many centuries prior to the onset of the
century of humiliation in the 1800s.

That doesn't mean that China is going to create a Sinocentric
international order that looks exactly like the American-led
international order. I'm sure it will be different in many respects. But
[just listening to what Chinese leaders say, it's harder and harder to
deny that China seeks a world in which power balances have
changed]{.underline}, [and in which China has an increasing ability to
write the rules of the road in the 21st century]{.underline} in the way
that the U.S. wrote them in the 20th.

**China [actively promotes]{.underline} an illiberal world order
centered around authoritarianism.**

Charles **Edel 21**, Global Fellow at the Wilson Center and a Senior
Fellow at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney;
and David O. Shullman, Director of the China Global Hub at the Atlantic
Council, 16 September 2021, "How China Exports Authoritarianism,"
*Foreign Affairs*,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-09-16/how-china-exports-authoritarianism.

[Although **some analysts**]{.underline} continue to [argue that China
does not pose an **ideological threat** to **prevailing democratic
norms** and that the CCP **does not export** its **ideology**, it is
**clear** that the [CCP has **embarked** on a **drive** to promote its
**style of authoritarianism** to **illiberal actors**]{.mark} around the
world]{.underline}. Its goal is not to spread Marxism or to undermine
individual democracies but rather to achieve political and economic
preeminence, and its efforts to that effect---spreading propaganda,
expanding information operations, consolidating economic influence, and
meddling in foreign political systems---are hollowing out democratic
institutions and norms within and between countries.

To respond to Beijing's ideological challenge, advocates of democracy
must have a better understanding of what China aims to achieve by
exporting its political model and how its actions are weakening
democracy globally. Only then can they effectively design policies that
will reinvigorate democracy at home and abroad while selectively seeking
to counter Beijing's promotion of authoritarian governance.

RIGHT TO BE RULED

[[Beijing seeks]{.underline}]{.mark} less to impose a Marxist-Leninist
ideology on foreign societies than [[to]{.mark} **legitimate** and
[**promote** its **own authoritarian system**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
CCP does not seek ideological conformity but rather power, security, and
global influence for China and for itself. To this end, the party has
issued stark declarations of confidence in its own ideology and in the
country's antidemocratic political path. [Xi has **made clear** that he
regards China's **illiberal model** of governance as **superior** to
so-called Western political systems and that he seeks to **popularize**
this "**Chinese wisdom**" throughout the world as a "**contribution to
mankind**."]{.underline}

[[Xi]{.mark} and other Chinese leaders [frequently portray China's
economic success as **proof** that the road to prosperity **no longer**
runs through **liberal democracy**]{.mark}. As Xi put it]{.underline} at
the 19th Party Congress [in 2017, China's model offers "a **new option**
for other countries and nations who want to **speed up** their
**development** while]{.underline} preserving their
independence"---while [ignoring external pressure to **democratize**.
[This]{.mark} message [is **highly attractive** to leaders who hope to
achieve **economic success** without answering to the **demands of their
people**]{.mark}. Chinese officials now **commonly speak** of the
**"right"** of nations to **choose** their political systems, be they
**democratic or authoritarian**]{.underline}---[and the **arrogance** of
countries such as the United States that **assume** that **democracy**
is]{.underline} the **[preferable]{.underline}** option.

Advocating the right of countries to be ruled by nondemocratic regimes
is clearly different from forcibly installing autocratic leaders around
the world, as the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. But [[the
CCP's]{.mark} increasingly [**full-throated promotion** of
authoritarianism]{.mark} as a superior governance model [presents **no
less** of a **challenge** to democracy than did **Soviet
interference**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**particularly** when paired with
China's **economic** and **political measures** that **bolster
authoritarian regimes**]{.underline} and weaken democratic ones [around
the world]{.underline}.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE

[[China's **international efforts** to **subvert
democracy**]{.underline}]{.mark} fall into three broad categories. The
first [[includes its attempts to **shape the narrative** about China in
**developed countries**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In nations ranging from
Canada and Germany to Australia and Japan, [Beijing aims to **silence
critics** of China and **amplify** the voices of individuals and
institutions that promote **closer ties** with Beijing]{.underline} or a
more positive portrayal of China. [Beijing wields both **threats** and
**inducements** to this end, **rewarding positive portrayals** and
**punishing criticism**]{.underline}. As the Chinese ambassador to
Sweden admitted in 2019, "We treat our friends with fine wine, but for
our enemies we have shotguns."

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} offers preferential market access to
friendly governments, academic institutions, and businesses but
retaliates financially against those it sees as hostile to China's
interests. It also [**[threatens]{.mark} Chinese [dissidents]{.mark}**
and their families, **monitors** Chinese students **abroad**, attempts
to **silence academic discourse** deemed offensive to Beijing, and seeks
to **control** how foreigners are **educated** about China]{.underline}.
[Beijing has also sought to **expand** its **foreign media footprint**,
**control** Chinese-language media **abroad**, and turn Chinese diaspora
citizens **against parties** or candidates it deems **threatening** to
its **interests**]{.underline}. Taken together, [these actions form a
**comprehensive strategy** to inform, shape, and ultimately **control
perceptions** of China throughout the]{.underline} [world]{.underline}.

The second category of antidemocratic actions are those that take place
in developing countries. Unlike in the developed world, where China's
political and economic coercion and "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy have
engendered a growing backlash, Beijing has received a warmer welcome [in
many developing countries]{.underline}, where elites hope to learn from
a political system that has enabled China's transformation into the
world's second-largest economy. In a growing number of fragile
democracies, [[Beijing has **captured**]{.mark} small coteries of
**[corrupt elites]{.mark}** and helped them **centralize power** by
**insulating them** from the demands of **civil society** and deploying
Chinese technology to **repress** their citizens and help them
**maintain power** indefinitely. This is how the CCP is **exporting
authoritarianism** around the **globe**]{.underline}: not through
seminars on Marxist ideology, as some analysts have claimed, but through
a broad range of antidemocratic activities.

[China does so]{.underline} less [[out of a desire
to]{.underline}]{.mark} spread its ideology than to [[**expand its
influence** and **economic advantage**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its favored
partners are not fervent adherents of Marxism-Leninism but rather
officials, business leaders, media tycoons, and others who view the
adoption of a nondemocratic governance model that concentrates power in
the hands of the few---and shuts out the many---as a route to long-term
influence. This [preference for antidemocratic
collaborators]{.underline}, coupled with China's opaque and corrupt
investment practices, further **[corrodes democratic
institutions]{.underline}**, as murky deals struck by Chinese banks and
state-owned enterprises encourage a more corrupt and unaccountable class
of political elites all too eager to undermine their country's long-term
prosperity in return for personal gain.

[China offers **more** than **simple inspiration** for a nondemocratic
governance model]{.underline}: it provides the tools, training, and
resources that permit leaders to ignore democratic countries' demands
for good governance and respect for individual rights as a condition of
aid and investment. The CCP regularly conducts large-scale training
programs for foreign officials on how to guide public opinion, control
civil society, and implement Chinese-style cybersecurity policies in
their home countries. A growing number of countries have drawn
inspiration from China to pursue laws controlling social media or to
build Internet firewalls modeled on China's own "Great Firewall."
[[China]{.mark} also provides **[increasingly]{.mark} [sophisticated
surveillance tech]{.mark}nology** and [**internal security training** to
**established authoritarian** and fragile democratic
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}, enabling them to better suppress
dissent and control their own citizens. [In countries such as **Uganda**
and **Zambia**, CCP-linked organizations have **shared technology** and
**training** with **autocratic** and autocratic-leaning
governments]{.underline}, allowing them to monitor their citizens,
muzzle media and civil society, and impose repressive Internet rules.

[[The **CCP** has]{.mark} **also [engaged]{.mark}** [in more **explicit
political intervention** by **interfering directly** in the **political

a functioning democracy from the inside, making the slide toward
authoritarianism harder to detect.

This is a misguided, contradictory, and unnecessary effort. [Instead of

Indeed, Trump's reelection makes such a focus more urgent, even if the
global South can't expect great results while he is in office. [[The
rules-based order]{.mark} may have been riddled with

rules]{.underline}**, especially in the form of international treaties
aimed at securing the common good. [It [is in the interests of the

treaties]{.underline}. The current international order needs much
greater commitment from the United States; **[[the world does not

[[A world regulated]{.underline}]{.mark} and organized [[around

The Long Peace Must be Protected

Let's be clear: [[the US-led order has been the]{.underline} **[greatest
force for peace]{.underline}**]{.mark} and human progress [in modern
history. [The world has avoided a third world war that could **end life
on earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Former enemies became allies. [Over a
billion people rose out of extreme poverty]{.underline}. Colonial
empires ended, and a new era of long peace was maintained.

In the aftermath of World War II, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and]{.underline} its [democratic allies
[constructed a rules-based international order unlike any prior global
system.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This Western-led order]{.underline}, grounded in the basis of
collective security, open markets, the rule of law, and liberal values
-- [has propelled an era of critical peace and prosperity.]{.underline}

The long peace enjoyed since the end of WWII, has been pillared on the
strength and efficacy of both the world systems and institutional
capacity created by the US and the West, and the values and deterrent
power and might of the US in both preventing and stopping wars.

[For nearly eight decades, [no great-power war has engulfed the world, a
stark contrast to the first half of the 20th
century.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This long peace has been largely underappreciated despite the fact that
we are living in the most peaceful period of modern time]{.underline}.
[[This stability is a]{.underline} **[direct dividend]{.underline}** [of
the Western-led international orde]{.underline}]{.mark}[r]{.underline}
established after 1945,but **[[this is now at risk of being dismantled
by the forces out to undermine the current Western led
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with the persistent and strategic
undermining of the US rules based order.

[[Revisionist authoritarian powers seek to weaken]{.mark} the system of
alliances and [norms]{.mark} that has kept aggression in
check]{.underline}. To understand how the US anchored order has
preserved peace, saved lives, and deterred conflict, it is important to
fist visualise how this order might be threatened by the current
bandwagon of the world in ignoring this status quo of stability on the
grounds of being smitten by the so called rise of the rest and the
perceived inevitable decline of the West.

Contrary to these models and assumptions, the primary power and
stability of the US and the West and their power supremacy have not ever
been under threat by any of the rising powers out to challenge this
primacy.

In all indicators of power, whether economic, military, technology,
resources, demographics, and future trends, [the US retains a
significant power advantage]{.underline}, and no other power will come
close to replacing this primacy in at least the next three decades.

However, [[this rules-based order]{.mark} and the long peace [will be
threatened]{.mark} if the world conveniently ignores it and [if the US
is weakened]{.mark}]{.underline}. For all its flaws,[[the Western-led
order has been humanity's best safeguard against **global war**]{.mark}
**and tyranny.**]{.underline}

It has defeated totalitarian threats from fascism to communism to
terror, protected the global commons and trade arteries, fostered
unprecedented economic growth, saved lives through medical and
technological inventions, prevented tyrannies and autocratic forces from
unchecked human rights abuses, and championed humanitarian values.

All these make the case that the American-led rules-based system has
been our time's most important global force for peace and security.

The Long Peace Dividend: Deterrence, Democracy, and Rule of Law

[The most overlooked achievement]{.underline} of this long peace and
Western order [is the prevention of another catastrophic world
war]{.underline}. Before 1945, great-power conflicts were common with
the likes of the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, World War II, and
countless earlier wars among empires.

World War II alone killed an estimated 70--85 million people (about 3%
of the world's population. The US-led initiatives to establish a new
world order based on democracy and institutional governance, with the
likes of the United Nations, NATO, and the Bretton Woods systems, helped
to prevent conflicts and to minimise damages.

[US military strength and nuclear deterrence dissuade any would-be
aggressors from launching global war.]{.underline}

In essence[, a dominant democratic superpower acted as a stabiliser,
where]{.underline} the [hegemonic stability]{.underline} theory [helped
to keep peace and deter wars.]{.underline}

Conflict-related deaths have fallen dramatically from mid-20th-century
levels, reflecting the long peace under the post-WWII international
order.

By the 21st century, war deaths worldwide had dropped to historically
low rates -- in most years, conflict killed fewer than 1 in 700 people
globally. The avoidance of another great-power war is the chief reason.
The Cold War ended without direct superpower combat. The post-1945
great-power stability has twice outlasted the interwar period and is the
longest period of stability among the great powers in centuries. [[The
international order anchored by U.S.-led alliances, nuclear deterrence,
and democratic norms created a balance that made large-scale war
infeasible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hence, the world has reaped the reward
in hundreds of millions of lives not lost to war.

[Of parallel importance is the spread of democracy and the rule of law,
which has created more peaceful relations]{.underline}: **[[democracies
rarely fight one another]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as reflected in the
democratic peace theory.

[Countries that share the values of democracy and rule of
law]{.underline} through institutions like the EU or U.S. alliances have
virtually [eliminated the likelihood of conflict among
themselves]{.underline}. Western Europe, once the ground zero for two
world wars, has seen 77 years without war between major states.

This has moved us away from the notion of might is right to a time when
independent and sovereign nations would respect each other's rights and
rules, but this has now come under increasing threat without the US led
prevailing power stabiliser if other powers continue to undermine this.

The Western liberal order won the 20th century, making democracy and
free markets the prevailing paradigm worldwide. Millions in Eastern
Europe were freed from dictatorship and the Cold War ended with the
expansion of freedom and democracy and a liberal economic order that has
seen the global economic progress today.

From fascism to communism to terrorism, the Western-led order has
preserved the lives and freedoms of billions of people -- those rescued
from tyrannies, and those never caught in wars that were avoided.

As John Kennedy once said, "A mankind that has managed to avoid war is
one that will find prosperity and progress." The Western order has
embodied that maxim. Defending free nations and deterring aggressors
ensured that the latter half of the 20th century was far less bloody
than the first. It is difficult to imagine any alternative system
achieving the same record.

America as Global Policeman: Securing the Seas and Skies

American military preeminence has formed the global security backbone
that all nations benefit from. On the high seas, the U.S. Navy has
ensured freedom of navigation and the safety of maritime commerce for
decades. The U.S. Navy's dominance of the world's oceans has made it as
an indispensable guarantor of global trade, as 90% of global trade by
volume travels by sea. Under Pax Americana those sea lanes have remained
largely open and peaceful. No other power comes even close in having
this capacity and might to ensure global peace and maritime order.

U.S. and allied naval forces patrol choke points like the Persian Gulf,
Strait of Hormuz, and Strait of Malacca to deter blockades or piracy.

This resulted in energy supplies and goods flowing relatively freely,
fueling the world economy. The US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain and Seventh
Fleet in the Pacific act as constant stabilising presence in critical
regions.

[American-led security of the seas has been a true global public
good]{.underline} -- one often taken for granted. The US naval umbrella
not only secures trade but also allows countries to forgo building
massive navies of their own, thereby reducing arms races.

The stability of shipping routes enables astonishing expansion of global
commerce, where exports as a share of world GDP quadrupled from about 5%
in 1945 to over 20% by the 2000s, reflecting how much more
interconnected the world economy became under a US protected trading
system.

China benefited from this new economic order and the stability and
security of the market system and the maritime route that are critical
for its export oriented economy.

Beyond the seas, the US continued to lead in policing global airspace
and outer space. The US Air Force's global reach deters rogue states
from threatening civilian aviation and American GPS satellites provide
navigation free-of-charge worldwide, but borne by American taxpayers.

Prosperity Through Stability: Unprecedented Global Development

The Western-led order created conditions for a surge in global
prosperity, lifting billions out of poverty and transforming the
economic landscape. In 1950, much of Europe and Asia were still in ruins
as a result of the wars and most of the world's population lived in
poverty. Today, the world economy is roughly \$100 trillion in size.
Global GDP per capita has tripled since 1945. Life expectancy worldwide
has jumped from about 45 years in 1950 to over 72 years now, owing to
better nutrition, healthcare, and technology diffusion. These gains were
not inevitable, but rather they were nurtured by the Western system's
open markets, financial aid, and technological leadership.

Beyond the Marshall Plan, institutions like the World Bank funded
infrastructure and industrial projects in developing nations.

The security provided by the US led peace allowed countries to spend
resources on development rather than defense. Europe could demilitarise
compared to its past. Japan, shielded by the US alliance, devoted itself
entirely to economic growth, with minimal military spending.

Both China and India, which remained poor through the Cold War, saw
spectacular economic rises in the 1990s to 2000s by integrating into the
US led international economy.

China's export-driven boom, lifting 800 million people out of poverty,
and this was facilitated by access to Western markets and adherence to
Western-devised rules of trade and investment.

The numbers of people living in extreme poverty worldwide dropped
substantially. In 1990, more than 1.9 billion people, or 36% of the
world's population, lived under the World Bank's extreme poverty line.
By 2019, that number had fallen to about 650 million or around 8% of the
population. Over 1 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty in one
generation, where the stability and openness of the post-Cold War
international order allowed capital and goods to reach more places,
creating jobs and raising incomes.

The [Western-led international order has been the first to act in cases
of genocide, famine, or natural disaster, securing the sanctity of
life.]{.underline} From the concept of responsibility to protect, to
providing non-military humanitarian leadership, the order has sustained
basic human principles and sanctity of life.

The New Threat: Autocratic Revisionism and the Erosion of Order

**[[This order is now under threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where the
global pivot toward anti-US will unravel the fabric of international law
and norms that have kept the peace. [[From China's open defiance of
maritime law]{.underline}]{.mark} in Asia [[to]{.mark} the constant
[undermining]{.mark} of the global financial and American [security
support]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[these create the buy in for a
**post-American order**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that new forces might lead
if the US is weakened]{.underline}, but **[[the new order would be far
less stable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [less free, and potentially more
hazardous and risky for there is no precedent and no global experience
for any of these new powers in even experiencing any form of pervasive
global security and economic management, what more to lead the world in
revising the old rules.]{.underline}

[[Replacing rule-of-law principles with raw power politics will endanger
the world and push it back to the dangerous anarchic era of might is
right.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The revisionist ideology will **weaken the institutional
deterrence**]{.underline}, [putting the world into a more dangerous
phase of non abidance and non adherence to the rules based
order]{.underline}, where affiliation will be based on economic
entanglement and appeasement to the higher power based on the hard power
threats.

[[The diminished role for international law will create **spiralling
security dilemma, arms races and a free for all**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[where anarchy prevails]{.underline} in a survival-of-the-strongest era.
[The [constraints and deterrence on war]{.mark}]{.underline} and abuse
built up over 75 years, [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} deteriorate and
**[[erode quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}** [if this revisionist momentum
is not checked.]{.underline}

The world would be entering a period of high risk, just like the
unstable decades before 1914 or 1939, but with far deadlier weapons in
play.

History serves painful lessons of what happens when global orders are
overturned by aggressive powers. The world sleepwalked from the Concert
of Europe into World War I; the failure of the League of Nations in the
1930s led to World War II.

Defending the Greatest Peace System in History

Defending the rules-based order does not mean resisting change or being
blindly rooted to the conventional systemic approach, but reforms and
changes can be made. Notwithstanding that, core facets must remain.

These include the notions that aggression is unacceptable, genocides and
human rights abuses will never be tolerated, that all nations are bound
by common laws, and that democracy and human dignity are worth
protecting.

The order can endure and adapt as long as these ideals remain at the
forefront of the Western alliance. If they are abandoned, we risk
descending into an era of darkness again.

[For all its flaws, the current global order dominated by the single
Western power parity is still the best bet in preventing aggression,
saving lives, and inventing new progress for mankind.]{.underline}

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[shouldn't manage]{.mark} the [competition with China**; it should

up]{.mark} its [conventional forces]{.mark} faster than any country has
since World War II. These actions show that China isn't aiming for a
stalemate. Neither should America.]{.underline}

What would winning look like? China's communist rulers would give up
trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and
its friends. And the Chinese people---from ruling elites to everyday
citizens---would find inspiration to explore new models of development
and governance that don't rely on repression at home and compulsive
hostility abroad.

In addition to having greater clarity about its end goal, the United
States needs to accept that achieving it will require greater friction
in U.S.-Chinese relations. [[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to
adopt rhetoric and [policies that]{.mark} may feel uncomfortably
confrontational but in fact are necessary to [reestablish
boundaries]{.mark} that Beijing and its acolytes are
violating.]{.underline} That means imposing costs on Chinese leader Xi
Jinping for his policy of fostering global chaos. It means speaking with
candor about the ways China is hurting U.S. interests. It means rapidly
increasing U.S. defense capabilities to achieve unmistakable qualitative
advantages over Beijing. It means severing China's access to Western
technology and frustrating Xi's efforts to convert his country's wealth
into military power. And it means pursuing intensive diplomacy with
Beijing only from a position of American strength, as perceived by both
Washington and Beijing.

No country should relish waging another cold war. Yet a [[cold war is
already being waged]{.mark} against the United States [by China's
leaders. Rather than denying]{.mark} the existence of this [struggle,
Washington should own it]{.mark} and win it. [Lukewarm
statements]{.mark} that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely
[court]{.mark} a **[hot war]{.mark}**; they **[signal
complacency]{.mark}** to the American people and conciliation to Chinese
leaders]{.underline}. Like the original Cold War, the new cold war will
not be won through half measures or timid rhetoric. Victory requires
openly admitting that [a **[totalitarian regime]{.mark}** that
**[commits genocide, fuels conflict]{.mark}**, and **[threatens
war]{.mark}** will never be a reliable partner.]{.underline} Like the
discredited détente policies that Washington adopted in the 1970s to
deal with the Soviet Union, the current approach will yield little
cooperation from Chinese leaders while fortifying their conviction that
they can destabilize the world with impunity.

BIDEN'S NEW BASELINE

The administration's China policy initially showed promise. President
Joe Biden maintained the tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed
on Chinese exports in response to the rampant theft of U.S. intellectual
property. He renewed, with some adjustments, the executive orders Trump
had issued to restrict investment in certain companies affiliated with
the Chinese military and to block the import of Chinese technologies
deemed a national security threat. In a particularly important step, in
October 2022, Biden significantly expanded the Trump administration's
controls on the export of high-end semiconductors and the equipment used
to make them, slowing Beijing's plans to dominate the manufacturing of
advanced microchips. Across Asia, Biden's diplomats pulled longtime
allies and newer partners closer together. They organized the first
summits of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, bringing
together the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States,
and convened high-profile trilateral summits with the leaders of Japan
and South Korea. Biden also unveiled AUKUS, a defense pact among
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

As it turned out, however, aggression would come from the opposite
direction, in Europe. Less than three weeks before invading Ukraine,
Russian President Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[signed
a]{.mark} "no limits" [security pact with Xi]{.mark} in
Beijing.]{.underline} In a prudent step after the invasion, Biden drew a
redline by warning Xi in a video call that the U.S. government would
impose sweeping sanctions if China provided "material support" to
Moscow. [[Xi]{.mark} nonetheless [found]{.mark} plenty of [ways to
support]{.mark} the **[Russian war machine,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[sending semiconductors, unarmed drones, gunpowder, and other wares.
China also supplied Moscow with badly needed money in exchange for major
shipments of Russian oil. Chinese officials]{.underline}, according to
the U.S. State Department, [even spent more money on pro-Russian
propaganda worldwide than Russia itself was spending.]{.underline}

[Beijing was also [coordinating]{.mark} more closely [with Iran and
No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea[, even [as those
regimes sent]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} to help Moscow wage war in
Europe.]{.underline} Yet Washington was pursuing siloed
policies---simultaneously resisting Russia, appeasing Iran, containing
North Korea, and pursuing a mix of rivalry and engagement with
China---that added up to something manifestly incoherent. Indeed, the
situation that Xi had forecast at the start of the Biden administration
was becoming a reality: "The most important characteristic of the world
is, in a word, 'chaos,' and this trend appears likely to continue," Xi
told a seminar of high-level Communist Party officials in January 2021.
Xi made clear that this was a useful development for China. "The times
and trends are on our side," he said, adding, "Overall, the
opportunities outweigh the challenges." By March 2023, Xi had revealed
that he saw himself not just as a beneficiary of worldwide turmoil but
also as one of its architects. "Right now, there are changes, the likes
of which we haven't seen for 100 years," he said to Putin on camera
while wrapping up a visit to the Kremlin. "And we are the ones driving
these changes together."

If ever the time was ripe to call out Beijing for fomenting chaos and to
start systematically imposing costs on the country in response, it was
early 2023. Biden, inexplicably, was doing the opposite. On February 1,
residents of Montana spotted a massive, white sphere drifting eastward.
The administration was already tracking the Chinese spy balloon but had
been planning to let it pass overhead without notifying the public.
Under political pressure, Biden ordered the balloon shot down once it
reached the Atlantic Ocean, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
postponed a scheduled trip to Beijing to protest the intrusion. Press
reports suggested the administration had kept quiet about the balloon in
order to gather intelligence about it. But a troubling pattern of
downplaying affronts by Beijing would persist in other contexts.

In June 2023, leaks to the press revealed that Beijing, in a remarkable
echo of the Cold War, was planning to build a joint military training
base in Cuba and had already developed a signals intelligence facility
there targeting the United States. After a National Security Council
spokesperson called reports about the spy facility inaccurate, a White
House official speaking anonymously to the press minimized them by
suggesting that Chinese spying from Cuba was "not a new development."
The administration also greeted with a shrug new evidence suggesting
that COVID-19 may have initially spread after it accidentally leaked
from a Chinese laboratory. If the virus, which has led to the deaths of
an estimated 27 million people worldwide, turns out to have been
artificially enhanced before it escaped, the revelation would mark a
turning point in human history on par with the advent of nuclear
weapons---a situation that already cries out for U.S. leadership to
govern dangerous biological research worldwide.

In the spring of 2023, as Beijing's actions grew bolder, Biden initiated
what the White House termed an "all hands on deck" diplomatic
campaign---not to impose costs on Beijing but to flatter it by
dispatching five cabinet-level U.S. officials to China from May to
August. Blinken's June meeting with Xi symbolized the dynamic. Whereas
Xi had sat amiably alongside the billionaire Bill Gates just days
earlier, the U.S. secretary of state was seated off to the side as Xi
held forth from the head of a table at the Great Hall of the People. For
the first time in years, Xi appeared to have successfully positioned the
United States as supplicant in the bilateral relationship.

What did the United States get in return for all this diplomacy? In the
Biden administration's tally, the benefits included a promise by Beijing
to resume military-to-military talks (which Beijing had unilaterally
suspended), a new dialogue on the responsible use of artificial
intelligence (technology that Beijing is already weaponizing against the
American people by spreading fake images and other propaganda on social
media), and tentative cooperation to stem the flood of precursor
chemicals fueling the fentanyl crisis in the United States (chemicals
that are supplied mainly by Chinese companies).

Any doubts that Xi saw the American posture as one of weakness were
dispelled after Hamas's October 7 massacre in Israel. Beijing exploited
the attack by serving up endless anti-Israeli and anti-American
propaganda through TikTok, whose algorithms are subject to control by
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese diplomats, like Russian ones,
met with Hamas's leaders and provided diplomatic cover for the terrorist
group, vetoing UN Security Council resolutions that would have condemned
Hamas. And there is little sign Beijing has done anything, despite
Washington's requests, to help rein in attacks carried out by the
Houthis on commercial vessels and U.S. warships in the Red Sea---attacks
conducted by the Yemeni rebel group using Iranian missiles, including
ones with technology pioneered by China. (Chinese ships, unsurprisingly,
are usually granted free passage through the kill zone.)

Whether Xi is acting opportunistically or according to a grand
design---or, almost certainly, both---it is clear he sees advantage in
stoking crises that he hopes will exhaust the United States and its
allies. In a sobering Oval Office address in mid-October, Biden seemed
to grasp the severity of the situation. "We're facing an inflection
point in history---one of those moments where the decisions we make
today are going to determine the future for decades to come," he said.
Yet bizarrely---indeed, provocatively---he made no mention of China, the
chief sponsor of the aggressors he did call out in the speech: Iran,
North Korea, and Russia. Through omission, Biden gave Beijing a pass.

THAT '70S SHOW

The current moment bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1970s. The Soviet
Union was undermining U.S. interests across the world, offering no
warning of its ally Egypt's 1973 surprise attack on Israel; aiding
communists in Angola, Portugal, and Vietnam; and rapidly expanding its
nuclear arsenal and investing heavily in its conventional military.
These were the bitter fruits of détente---a set of policies pioneered by
President Richard Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser, Henry
Kissinger, who stayed on and continued the approach under President
Gerald Ford. By using pressure and inducement, as well as downplaying
ideological differences, the United States tried to lure the Russians
into a stable equilibrium of global power. Under détente, Washington
slashed defense spending and soft-pedaled Moscow's human rights
affronts. The working assumption was that the Soviet Union's appetite
for destabilizing actions abroad would somehow be self-limiting.

But the Russians had their own ideas about the utility of détente. As
the historian John Lewis Gaddis observed, the Soviets "might have viewed
détente as their own instrument for inducing complacency in the West
while they finished assembling the ultimate means of applying
pressure---their emergence as a full-scale military rival of the United
States." Nixon and Kissinger thought détente would secure Soviet help in
managing crises around the world and, as Gaddis put it, "enmesh the
U.S.S.R. in a network of economic relationships that would make it
difficult, if not impossible, for the Russians to take actions in the
future detrimental to Western interests." But the policy failed to
achieve its goals.

President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977 intending to keep
détente in place, but the policy didn't work for him either. His attempt
to "de-link" Soviet actions that hurt U.S. interests from Soviet
cooperation on arms control ultimately yielded setbacks in both
categories. The Soviets became more aggressive globally, and a wary U.S.
Congress, having lost faith in Moscow's sincerity, declined to ratify
SALT II, the arms control treaty that Carter's team had painstakingly
negotiated. Meanwhile, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security
adviser, had grown increasingly skeptical of détente. Brzezinski felt
that a turning point had come in 1978, after the Soviets sponsored
thousands of Cuban soldiers to wage violent revolution in the Horn of
Africa, supporting Ethiopia in its war with Somalia. The Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan the following year was "the final nail in the coffin" for
arms control talks, Brzezinski wrote in his journal---and for the
broader policy of détente.

By the time President Ronald Reagan entered the White House, in 1981,
Nixon and Kissinger's invention was on its last legs. "Détente's been a
one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims,"
Reagan stated flatly in his first press conference as president,
effectively burying the concept.

Reagan sought to win, not merely manage, the Cold War. In a sharp
departure from his immediate predecessors, he spoke candidly about the
nature of the Soviet threat, recognizing that autocrats often bully
democracies into silence by depicting honesty as a form of aggression.
In 1987, when Reagan was preparing to give a speech within sight of the
Berlin Wall, some of his aides begged him to remove a phrase they found
gratuitously provocative. Wisely, he overruled them and delivered the
most iconic line of his presidency: "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall."

THE SMOKELESS WAR

Washington must adopt a similar attitude today and try harder to
disseminate truthful information within China itself and to make it
possible for Chinese citizens to communicate securely with one another.
Tearing down---or at least blowing holes in---the "Great Firewall" of
China must become as central to Washington's approach today as removing
the Berlin Wall was for Reagan's.

#### We're on the brink of world war 3\-\--only US lead solves

**Oleson 25**, Former Director for Intelligence and Space Policy for the
Secretary of Defense (Peter, "PacNet #2 -- Preventing World War III by
preparing for it," Pacific Forum,
https://pacforum.org/publications/pacnet-2-preventing-world-war-iii-by-preparing-for-it/)

[There are a lot of [factors]{.mark} that [point to
**today**]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[being the early stages of World War
III]{.mark}. Multiple [countries are]{.mark} involved [in open
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Many]{.underline} more [are openly or
surreptitiously supporting one or more of the combatants.]{.underline}

**[Russia]{.underline}**'s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is
supported by **[Iran]{.underline}**ian drones and missiles; **[North
Korean]{.underline}** troops, missiles, and ammunition; Chinese sub rosa
supply of advanced electronics needed for Russian weapon production; and
funding from others, including African countries which have enabled
Russian "private military companies" (which are, in fact, controlled by
Russian military intelligence---the GRU) to exploit natural resources,
especially gold, which is sold on the black market.

Twenty-five of the 26 NATO nations are supporting Ukraine with funds and
weaponry. The exception is Hungary under Victor Orbán, an autocrat like
Vladimir Putin. Others providing aid to Ukraine include Japan, South
Korea, and Australia.

In the Middle East, Iran and its surrogates (Hamas in the Gaza Strip;
Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria; and the Houthis in Yemen) have been in
open conflict with Israel since October 2023. Iran receives some support
from Russia. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria is a setback for
Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia.

Israel has been supported by many Western nations, especially the US,
which have supplied weaponry and especially air defense systems.
Neighboring nations over which ballistic missiles and drones fly
(Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait) have tried to remain neutral. Jordan
reportedly has shot down intruding Iranian drones aimed at Israel.

Islamist groups continue to attack their enemies in the Middle East and
South Asia. Pakistan and Afghanistan have attacked "enemies" in each
other's territories. The Islamic State remains active in Syria, Iran,
and in other nations where it has inspired lone wolf attacks, including
the US.

[[There are]{.mark} other "**[hot spots]{.mark}**" that are ripe for
conflict eruption]{.underline}. China's threats against
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** and hostile actions against the
Philippines in **[[the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}** could easily erupt into warfare.
[**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea's actions against South
Korea]{.underline} are increasingly hostile in appearance and Kim openly
threatens the Indo-Pacific with his missile and nuclear programs.

When did this outbreak of wars start? Historians can point to Putin's
2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference when Putin, who thought
the collapse of the Soviet Union was a tragedy for Russia, expressed his
opposition to the world order that he blamed on the US. His policies
since have been distinctly anti-Western. He has sought to reassemble the
Russian empire of old. The Arab-Israeli hostility started long before,
some historians dating it to 1938 with British policies toward
Palestine. Since then Israel and its neighbors have fought seven wars.
Iran's hostility toward Israel since the 1979 revolution that brought
Ayatollah Khomeini and the mullahs to power exacerbated the situation.
The China-Taiwan hostile standoff dates from 1949 when the Chinese
Communist Party seized power on the mainland, but the Kuomintang fled
and seized the island of Formosa (Taiwan).

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 did not proceed as
planned. Now in its third year it has had unexpected consequences for
Moscow. NATO has expanded further with the addition of Finland and
Sweden. Western weapons have allowed Ukraine to bring the war to Russian
soil. Partly in response Russia has turned to hybrid warfare against the
West. Using intelligence agents, third parties, and recruited criminals
for sabotage in NATO countries, Russia has tried to undermine Western
support for Ukraine.

The Nov. 25 crash of air freight DHL's 737, which left Leipzig, Germany
for Vilnius, Lithuania is likely tied to Russian sabotage. DHL appears
to be a special target of Russian operatives. In July a DHL warehouse
fire in Leipzig has been linked to Russian agents. Also, there was a DHL
warehouse fire in Birmingham, UK on July 22. Lithuanian authorities have
arrest four people accused of sending incendiary devices from a DHL
store in Vilnius. One Western European intelligence official opined that
the attacks on DHL are practice runs for future sabotage of
transatlantic flights to the US and Canada.

Other recent hybrid warfare incidents include: An assassination plot
against Armin Papperger, the CEO of Germany's Rheinmettal, which
supplies Ukraine with ammunition; arson attacks in Lithuania and Latvia;
break-ins at water treatment plants in Finland, Sweden, and Germany;
widespread cyberattacks; and disinformation about Ukrainian elements
attacking a NATO facility in Romania. Multiple undersea cable breaks in
the Baltic appear to be tied to Moscow's hybrid warfare. Western
European officials indicate that the number of such incidents has
increased dramatically in 2024 and been described by Western
intelligence chiefs as increasingly reckless.

Reuters reported "On July 10, an individual identifying themselves as a
26-year-old Russian-speaking Estonian named Valeri Ivanov messaged a
Telegram account promoted on several pro-Kremlin social media feeds that
was looking for European nationals to conduct sabotage within their
countries." Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Britain have each
arrested suspected Russian-sponsored actors for sabotage and other
offences. Poland has arrested four people in connection with fires
charging them with conducting sabotage on behalf of a foreign
intelligence agency.

In October the heads of CIA and Britain's MI6 stated that Russia was
waging a "reckless campaign of sabotage" across the continent. US
officials have issued warnings to American defense companies to increase
their security precautions, blaming Russia for the increase in sabotage
in Europe.

Russia's hybrid attacks thus far have been careful not to cross a
threshold that might trigger Article 5 of the NATO Treaty whereby an
attack against one member is considered an attack on all. But things can
go wrong.

**[[Today's regional wars are linked]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A Russian
success in Ukraine worries many political scientists who fear [that a
[defeat]{.mark} for the West, or a diminution of it]{.underline}s
support for embattled nations, [[will encourage other autocrats to turn
to]{.mark} outright [military action]{.mark} to achieve their
goals]{.underline}.

The West needs to remember the historical lessons of Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Sept. 30. 1938 and Hitler's
subsequent takeover in March 1939 of the remainder of Czechoslovakia and
invasion of Poland in September.

[The US remains the world's leading nation, but]{.underline} given the
state of the world **[[it is no time to turn
inward]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Being a leader implies having
responsibilities. For the US, which believes in individual freedoms,
democracy, and justice, it is imperative to support those nations
threatened by aggressive autocrats seeking to expand their powers. In
Europe this includes Ukraine and neighboring Moldova which is facing
Kremlin-supported subversion. It also involves the Baltic states and the
Baltic Sea. Russian "shadow fleet" ships used to evade sanctions need to
be stopped and searched when sailing through NATO nation waters and
allowed to continue only if legitimately engaged in commerce. Expanded
sanctions ought to include aggressive expulsion of Russian "diplomats,"
and others identified as associated with its security services, and
restricted visa approvals.

In the Indo-Pacific region the US and its Quad partners need to continue
their enhanced support for Pacific island nations. Economic aid to
provide future employment opportunities is a long-term need. Expansion
of nations' domestic capabilities to enforce laws at sea, especially
focused on illegal fishing in exclusive economic zones, is especially
important as fish populations decline significantly. US presence is
fundamental to countering aggressive Chinese initiatives, including
usurious loans and the presence of Chinese police and "security" forces.
The volatile situations involving the Philippines and Taiwan, given that
Beijing consistently rejects established international law and
diplomacy, as well as North Korea's nuclear saber rattling, require
significant enhancements to US military power in the Western Pacific.

**[[The next few years will be difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many
autocrats see opportunities believing that the US' world position is
diminishing. **[[America needs]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
**[[strength]{.underline}]{.mark}**en its alliances worldwide. This will
require much diplomacy, investment, and attention [[to limit]{.mark}
current and future [conflicts and **avoid a third world
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Turning to solutions, [how should Washington strengthen the liberal
order]{.underline} against these revisionist powers, especially at a
time when isolationism, or something like it, is on the rise in
America[?]{.underline}

We have to recognize that **[[there is no stable balance of power in
Eurasia without the engagement of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}** The history of the 20th century showed
that [[only America had the capacity to stabilize]{.mark} the key
regions of [Eurasia]{.mark}, to [protect them against
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} from without [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
also to [[tamp down on the conflicts within them that had previously
torn those regions apart]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nothing has changed
dramatically enough since the 20th century to suggest that Eurasia will
be able to keep its own balance if the U.S. drops out.

### LIO Turn---AT: Decline Inevitable---1AR

#### Heg decline not inevitable

**Nye 24**, former dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School and a
member of the Atlantic Council's Board of Directors Joseph, "Think the
American century is over? Think again.," Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/think-the-american-century-is-over-think-again/)

In this contentious election year, one of the most significant questions
is [[whether we]{.mark} are [witnessing the end of an age]{.mark} in
which the United States has been]{.underline} the [dominant]{.underline}
power. In my new memoir, A Life in the American Century, I make a case
for optimism.

I have lived through eight decades of an American era that included
World War II, Hiroshima, and wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and
Iraq. [[The Cold War ended **without**]{.underline}]{.mark} the nuclear
**[[catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}** that hung over our heads, [[but
it]{.mark} [was replaced by]{.mark} a period of [hubris]{.mark} as the
United States became the world's **sole** superpower. [That unipolar
moment]{.mark} was soon [replaced by fears of]{.mark}]{.underline}
transnational **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[cyber]{.underline}** wars. Analysts today speak about a new cold war
with a rising China and fear of nuclear escalation following Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. Our mental maps of the world have changed
dramatically over my lifetime.

For those eight decades, we have lived in what TIME publisher Henry
Luce, in March 1941, baptized "the American Century." In the nineteenth
century, the global balance of power was centered in Europe, which sent
its imperial tentacles around the world. The United States was a bit
player with a military not much larger than that of Chile. [As the
twentieth century began, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[became the world's largest industrial power, and accounted
for]{.underline} nearly [a quarter of the world economy]{.underline} (as
it still does today).

When US President Woodrow Wilson decided to send two million troops to
Europe in 1917, the United States tipped the balance in World War I. But
afterwards, the United States "returned to normal" and, in the 1930s,
became strongly isolationist. It is more accurate to date the American
century to US President Franklin Roosevelt's entry into World War II in
1941. It was in that context, to resist isolationism and urge
participation in the war, that Luce coined his famous term. Some have
referred to an American empire, but our power always had limits. It is
more accurate to think of the American century as the period since World
War II during which time, for better or for worse, the United States has
been the preeminent power in global affairs.

[[There is a case for pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time,
[[we Americans]{.mark} have [survived **worse**]{.mark}
periods]{.underline} in the 1890s, 1930s, and 1960s.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[remains]{.mark} the world's [strongest]{.mark}]{.underline} military
[[power]{.mark} as well as [the largest economy]{.mark},
but]{.underline} since the 2010s [[China]{.mark} has [become a
**near-peer**]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
[[competitor]{.underline}]{.mark}, and large parts of our country have
reacted negatively to the disruptions caused by globalization. As yet,
[this contemporary era has no fixed label.]{.underline}

So what sort of a world am I leaving to my grandchildren and their
generation? I tried to examine part of it in my 2015 book [[Is the
American Century Over]{.underline}]{.mark}? and concluded that the
[answer]{.underline} to that question **[was
"[no]{.mark},"]{.underline}** [but]{.underline} that American [primacy
in this century will not look like the twentieth century]{.underline}. I
argued that [[the greatest danger]{.mark} we Americans face [is]{.mark}
not that China will surpass us, but [that]{.mark} the [diffusion of
power will produce]{.mark} **entropy**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}
the **[[inability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to get anything
done]{.underline}.

China is an impressive peer competitor with great strengths but also
weaknesses. In assessing the overall balance of power, the United States
has at least five long-term advantages. One is geography. The United
States is surrounded by two oceans and two friendly neighbors, while
China shares a border with fourteen other countries and is engaged in
territorial disputes with several. The United States also has an energy
advantage, whereas China depends on energy imports. Third, the United
States derives power from its large transnational financial institutions
and the international role of the dollar. A credible reserve currency
depends on it being freely convertible, as well as on deep capital
markets and the rule of law, which China lacks. The United States also
has a relative demographic advantage as the only major developed country
that is currently projected to hold its place (third) in the global
population ranking. Seven of the world's fifteen largest economies will
have a shrinking workforce over the next decade, but the US workforce is
expected to increase, while China's peaked in 2014. Finally, the United
States has been at the forefront in important new technologies (bio,
nano, and information). China, of course, is investing heavily in
research and development and scores well in the numbers of patents, but
by its own measures its research universities still rank behind US ones.

All told, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [holds a strong]{.mark}
hand in this]{.underline} great-power [competition. [But if Americans
succumb to hysteria]{.mark} about China's rise or to complacency about
its "peak," [they could play]{.mark} their cards
**[poorly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Discarding high-value
cards]{.underline}---including strong alliances and influence in
international institutions---[would be a **serious**
mistake]{.underline}. China is not an existential threat to the United
States unless US leaders make it one by blundering into a major war. The
historical analogy that worries me is 1914, not 1941.

#### Heg is sustainable. The U.S. has [structural advantages]{.underline} over other countries.

[The **West** has **survived** frequent and often **intense crises** of
capitalism and endured the loss of colonial empires. It fought back
**geopolitical challenges**]{.underline} to its hegemony [from **Nazi
Germany**, **Imperial Japan**, and the **Soviet Union**]{.underline}.
[It is now locked in a new confrontation with **China**. And the
**odds** are **tilting in favour** of the **West**]{.underline}.
[[Until]{.mark} **very [recently]{.mark}**[, it was]{.mark} **widely
[assumed]{.mark}** that [China would **overtake** the **US**]{.mark} as
the world's largest economy]{.underline}, prise Europe out of American
dominance [and **emerge** as the **dominant power** in
Asia]{.underline}.

Some of [[those **dreams** have **crashed** against
**reality**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Slow down in **growth**]{.mark} [and
**demographic decline** suggest China]{.mark} [is **unlikely** to
**overtake**]{.mark} [the US]{.mark} economy **any time soon**, if
**ever**]{.underline}. Yet, it is possible to argue that the
Sino-Russian alliance unveiled by Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir
Putin presents a formidable challenge to Western primacy. Yet, both
Russia and China are eager for an accommodation with the West. Despite
his tough rhetoric against the "collective West", Putin needs a deal
with the US to secure a new European compact in which Moscow can play a
major role. President Xi, whose soaring imagination about a post-Western
order in Asia was making waves a few years ago, is now promising
President Joe Biden that he is not seeking to overthrow the US-led order
but seeking a dignified coexistence.

In both [[Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}, there is a long lineage
of political forces that seek Westernisation and integration with the
US-led order. They have had to battle the Russian "Slavophiles" and
Chinese nationalists who seek to define their national path in
non-Western if not anti-Western terms. The Westernisers in Russia and
China might be on the defensive now but have not disappeared from the
political scene. For both Putin and Xi, the question is not about
fighting a forever war with the West, negotiating favourable terms of
accommodation. Meanwhile, their **[[aggressive
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Europe and Asia [[are
**compelling**]{.mark} their [neighbours to move **closer** to the
**US**]{.mark} and **enhance** the **power** of the
**West**]{.underline}. [For many in Europe and Asia,
America]{.underline}, the distant power, [is **very welcome** in the
effort to **limit** the power of the **regional hegemons**]{.underline}.

The story is not different [[in the **Middle
East**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**Iran** may be rocking the US-led order
in the region, but it is **not strong enough** to promote an
**alternative**]{.underline}. [Many [**Arab regimes** see Iran]{.mark}
and its proxies like Hamas [as a]{.mark} **bigger [threat]{.mark}** [to
their existence]{.mark} than **Israel**]{.underline}. [For many Arab
states, the distant [**America** remains]{.mark}]{.underline} a valuable
and [[the **only balancer**]{.mark} against **Tehran**.]{.underline}

[What about the potential role of BRICS]{.underline} as a bulwark
against the West? Well, Argentina has just declined to join the forum
--- the invitation was extended at the BRICS summit in South Africa last
year. Earlier, Indonesia had said it was not ready to join the forum
when the expansion was being discussed. In any case, the [**[deepening
contradictions]{.mark}** [between **India** and **China**]{.mark} have
[cast a **shadow** over]{.mark} the **[BRICS]{.mark}** [and **other
non-Western institutions**]{.mark} like the SCO]{.underline}, where both
Delhi and Beijing are members. The [**contradictions** within the rest
are **deep**]{.underline} and must always be factored in assessing the
real and serious tensions between the West and the rest.

[What about the **decline** in the **economic weight** of the **G7** in
the global economy]{.underline}? To be sure, [the share of G7's GDP has
been on a **continuous decline**]{.underline} in the 21st century. [Much
of that decline, though, has come from **Europe**. The US **retains**
nearly **24 per cent** of the **global GDP**]{.underline}. [The
**relative economic decline** of Europe]{.underline} vis-a-vis the US
and China and its security vulnerability vis-a-vis Russia [will **only
help consolidate** the West under **American leadership**]{.underline}.

[Although the **rise of the rest** is **real**, [the West continues to
**lead** in]{.mark} the production of new **[scientific
knowledge]{.mark}** and **[tech]{.mark}nological [innovation]{.mark}**.
**Resilient** economic and political institutions **cushion** Western
societies from **internal turbulence** and **external challenges**.
Western **[academia]{.mark}**, [**think tanks**, **arts** and
**culture**]{.mark} continue to exercise **powerful influence
worldwide**]{.underline}. The broader attraction of Western societies is
reflected in the fact that [**millions** of people
worldwide]{.underline}, including from India, [are **eager** to find a
way into Europe and North America]{.underline}, either legally or
illegally. No amount of political posturing by their elites is going to
diminish the Western pull for Indian professionals, Chinese computer
geeks, Russian dissidents, and talented people from everywhere in the
world.

Not Ready to Remake the World Order

China has gained more ground from Trump's retreat to defend its values
and interests. However, [[China]{.mark}]{.underline} remains a
revisionist stakeholder and [[is **not ready to remake the world
order**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} "America
First" and self-centered [[unilateralism have demonstrated]{.mark} all
the hallmarks of [a revisionist state]{.mark}, making it far easier for
China to be seen as a responsible stakeholder]{.underline} in the world
order. Distinguishing itself from Trump's unilateralism that has thrown
quite chaos and has torn away the very bedrock of the postwar order
under which, for all its faults, China and many other countries have
prospered mightily, [[China has continued to promote
multilat]{.mark}eralism as it interpreted and position itself as the
global ballast and institution-builder [by]{.mark} pledging to continue
[supporting the WTO and UN]{.mark}]{.underline}, honoring the Paris
Accord and other international treaties and working together with other
countries to address global challenges.

[[China has launched new initiatives and institutions]{.underline},
**[but they do not amount to replacing the existing
order]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} commentaries
expressed [[fear]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[China would]{.mark} use the
BRICS, BRI, and AIIB to [create]{.mark} [alternative rules for its
narrow interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, **[[none of them has
even been close to that]{.mark} end.]{.underline}** For example, the
Beijing-led AIIB has not become a blatant agent of Chinese foreign
policy but a multilateral development institution. The AIIB modeled the
governance structure and standards of established multilateral lending
institutions, engaged former officials from these institutions to help
craft policies, and pledged \"lean, clean, and green.\" Emphasizing
transparency, accountability, openness, and independence, AIIB adopted
international norms and standards in line with the practices of
established institutions in environment, society, disclosure,
procurement, debt sustainability, and oversight mechanisms.

[[As part of the postwar order]{.underline}, **[not apart from
it]{.underline}**]{.mark} as was the Soviet Union, [[China holds a stake
in maintaining the order that allows it to pursue its agenda within the
existing]{.mark} international institutional
[framework]{.mark}]{.underline}---freed up to do so by the United
States' new spoiler role. This role is won by default, not by taking
leadership in supplying regional and global public goods---let alone
collaborating with partners, such as the United States did in the years
after World War 2, to wrap itself in multilaterally negotiated rules.37

[Proponents of the International Liberal order have spent much of its
lifespan trying to shield it from criticism.]{.underline} They've
actively masked its shortcomings, dismissing any flaws and
Inconsistencies. A fortune has been spent on media influence campaigns
and another on military campaigns to re-inforce this ideal, all to keep
the rules based order well made up and hide any signs of cracking.
Whether these costly efforts to preserve the sanctity of the liberal
order were worth it as opposed to facing the reality of its challenges
remains an open question. But here we are, it did not work. At least not
in the way that the costume designers intended. The make-up still flaked
and the cracks still showed. But even then, the ever zealous stylists
insisted: the show must go- on.

Now, more countries are asking questions about the undisputed beauty of
the rules based order and predictably, those who spent years crafting
its reputation and covering up its shortcomings view this mere
questioning as an attack. They overreact because deep down they are
aware that the package they are marketing is not complete but hoped no
one else would notice or even dare to speak up about it. This
[[panic]{.underline}]{.mark} has [made [China's genuine
interrogation]{.mark} [of the liberal order come off as an]{.mark}
outright challenge and [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. But China will not
relent and the global south has picked up the scent too.

In his book 21 lessons for the 21st century, Yuval Noah Harari argues
that many critics of the liberal system point out its problems but fail
to offer solutions. On this point, I beg to differ. **[[China has
offered a workable solution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It's not pushing
for the **overthrow** of the]{.mark} liberal
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but rather an
upgrade]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[China's proposal]{.underline}]{.mark}
essentially [[keeps]{.mark} many of [the good things]{.mark} about the
liberal order]{.underline}; [[Free trade,]{.mark} international
[institutions]{.mark}, cultural exchange, [sovereignty]{.mark} and
[non-aggression, democracy]{.mark} and [human
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}---at least in principle [and advocates for
it to be more just and inclusive]{.underline}. [[It recognizes]{.mark}
that [the]{.mark} fundamental [problem]{.mark} of the liberal order
[lies in its **western-centric nature**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [this
nature]{.underline} automatically **[breeds structural
inequality]{.underline}** for all the rest. And that is China's biggest
crime in the eyes of the liberal order's stylists: insisting that the
system live up to its aspirations.

The liberal order has seen inequality widen among and within nations.
The gap between the rich and the poor has significantly increased. When
it comes to income, the richest 10% globally make 52% of the global
income while the poorest half make only 8%. The wealth gap is even more
astounding with the richest 10% owning 76% of global wealth while the
poorest just owns 2%. This disparity extends to climate injustice. The
wealthiest nations emit more greenhouse gases in total and per capita
compared to the poorest nations and yet it's the latter that bear the
brunt of the consequences; floods, drought, food insecurity, and
displacement.

We have recently gone through a global pandemic that claimed millions
and tested the strength of global solidarity and are now facing a global
economic downturn coupled with a surge in regional conflicts that risk
escalating into something worse. The InfoTech and Biotech sectors are
increasingly running out of control of public oversight, unemployment
and the threat of future unemployment are on the rise and many countries
are now looking to build physical, economic and ideological walls
instead of bridges.

China, more than any nation seems to recognize this impasse and is
proposing an alternative approach to global political management.
China's current political ideology and system are always misunderstood
either deliberately or out of ignorance. The Chinese managed to borrow
the best ideas from ideological currents of the modern world;
Nationalism, communism and liberalism.

The Chinese are nationalists at the core with a strong identity that
they revere. They have adapted a 'socialism with Chinese
characteristics' that respects their unique identity and national
realities and have chosen to participate and contribute to the global
liberal order through their opening up and consistent advocacy for the
rule of law and respect to international institutions. The Chinese have
not made the mistake of assuming that one system is better than all and
fits all national contexts. They have applied logic to international
relations and let humans control the system instead of having systems
control humans. They have chosen ideological pragmatism instead of
ideological purity.

Should China continue on its current trajectory, it will avoid the
classic trap of ideology. Essentially, humans should inform and shape
ideology instead of ideology governing and informing humans. Ideologies
should evolve with new experiences, data and moral insight. When
ideologies inform humans, they risk becoming too rigid and form into
dogma. This creates a system that resists change, punishes dissent and
caters to the few. [China's concept of whole process democracy caters to
all]{.underline}---this is why it has had a lot of success with lifting
millions out of extreme poverty which is arguably the most democratic
outcome of our time.

On the other hand, the West's democratic systems or most liberal
democracies allow for endless democratic processes but often produce
very undemocratic outcomes. Question is; what's the point of choosing a
leader every four or so years if the life of most citizens remain
unchanged or even worsen? I propose we should adapt a system that would
give both in a form that respects national contexts.

[[While the West has managed to democratize]{.underline}]{.mark} to some
extent [[internally]{.underline}, **[this success has failed to reflect
on the international stage]{.underline}**.]{.mark} This could simply
indicate that while the liberal ideology in its pure form may work most
of the time within western societies, it needs some adjustments when
applied globally and within different national contexts.

Currently, [we are witnessing the logical conclusion of liberalism
within western societies]{.underline}. Ironically, **[[it is liberalism
itself that enables the rise of illiberal actors]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[who reject the very system that elevates them.]{.underline} In other
words, liberal societies can elect a fascist or communist leader or
leaders that generally reject liberal norms. In theory, the system is
designed to contain such outcomes or their consequences through checks
and balances but what happens when a liberal system fails to contain
illiberal ideas or allows for its tenets to be dismantled from within?
This is no longer a hypothetical because current upheavals within Europe
and the United States indicate we are already at this stage of the
equation.

#### China is [better]{.underline} for international order than the US.

to the Strategic Discourse on China's Rise, *Journal on Indo-Pacific
Affairs*, Winter 2019, Available Online at:
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/JIPA/journals/Volume-02_Issue-4/McKinney.pdf)

[One of the most repeated ideas in international affairs
discourse]{.underline} today [is that after World War II the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [created a **"free and open
international order"**]{.underline} [and that this order has been
responsible for keeping the Indo-Pacific "largely peaceful" for the last
80 years.]{.underline}4 [**China** is then typically said to be
promoting a vision "incompatible" with this
order]{.underline}---something that should make us worry, as it may
herald the return of violent power politics.5

Michael Lind has summarized the perspective:"in my experience, most
members of [the U.S. foreign policy elite sincerely believe that the
alternative to perpetual U.S. world domination is chaos and
war]{.underline}."6 It is indeed true that the years since World War II
have been peaceful when compared with most of European history and that
violence of all kinds has declined.7 [This phenomenon has been dubbed
the "New Peace,"]{.underline} and the United States certainly played
some role in bringing it about.8

[However, [there is no consensus]{.mark} among scholars [to what extent
US]{.mark} actions---or more abstractly, the supposed
["order"---contributed to the decline in war]{.mark}]{.underline} and
violence. [Existing academic explanations stress the role
of]{.underline} **[[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** restraining
states from major war;9 the evolution of territorial norms (as well as
regimes and institutions, like the United Nations);10 the development of
globalized markets and "trading states";11 the longer-term spread of
reason, sympathy, and feminization alongside the rise of stronger
states;12 [the settlement of territorial disputes after World War
II]{.underline};13 the spread of democracies;14 [the declining utility
of war as a rational instrument of statecraft]{.underline};15 and
hegemonic stability, which emphasizes (in its liberal form) how the
United States helped create global institutions and shape norms16 and
(in its "realist" form) how US power has deterred or compelled rivals to
behave.17 This is not the place to judge between the various
explanations, but it should be clear that they are diverse and the
overall explanation is likely multivariate. Only the realist version of
hegemonic stability directly supports the narrative of the free and open
international order. Christopher [[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark} has
recently [sought to test the theory by looking at the changing pattern
of global peace/violence relative to US military spending]{.underline},
frequency of intervention, and selection of grand strategy across four
presidential administrations (Bush Sr. to Obama). [He [found **no
relationship**]{.mark}]{.underline} at all. "As it stands," he
concluded, "[the only evidence we have regarding the [relationship
between US power and international stability suggests that the two are
**unrelated**]{.mark}]{.underline}."18 [If US officials and strategic
pundits are going to claim that peace is dependent on an abstract order
created and maintained by American power, they need to provide serious
evidence]{.underline} for their claims. Until then, while we can be
thankful that the United States contributed to postwar institutions like
the United Nations, helped delegitimize colonialism, and did not abuse
its power (as much) as many other states would have, policy makers and
scholars should be highly skeptical of more sweeping claims.

Laying aside the question of how the New Peace came about, [another oft
repeated notion is that China is determined to undermine the
contemporary international order]{.underline}, according to Friedberg,
by corrupting, subverting, and exploiting it.19 [The proof for this
claim is generally said to be]{.underline} China's "militarization" of
the South China Sea (SCS) through ["salami-slicing" and "grey-zone
tactics,"20 and occasionally, a retired Chinese official]{.underline} or
Global Times commentator [is quoted as representative of
China's]{.underline} official (even if unarticulated) policy and
[intentions]{.underline}. In the abstract, such claims are alarming---in
context, and in balance, rather humdrum. In fact, [[the evidence of any
Chinese intention to destroy]{.mark}, or even merely undermine and
exploit, [the current order is **slight**]{.mark}]{.underline}. China is
certainly using its growing military power to defend its claims in the
SCS and even---on occasion--- to coerce its neighbors. It uses
protectionist economic policies to boost the prospects of Chinese
companies and reduce competition. It employs economic statecraft to
serve its interests abroad. And it certainly is opposed to America's
policy of global democracy promotion. [However, [**none** of these
positions fundamentally challenge the existing order, none of them
radically depart from]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[America's own
actions]{.underline}**]{.mark} when it was a rising power in the
nineteenth century, [and none of them obviously surpass **[America's own
contemporary record of order subversion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[When the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[was a rising power, it took half of Mexico]{.underline} and considered
taking the rest, it [**[colonized]{.underline}** [the Philippines and
Hawaii]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} it [unilaterally seized
the maritime choke points of the Caribbean]{.underline} (Puerto Rico and
Cuba).21 [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [used
tariffs]{.underline}---which by 1857 averaged 20 percent22 and by the
end of the nineteenth century were "the highest import duties in the
industrial world"23---to protect its industries. It [stole intellectual
property]{.underline},24 [and]{.underline} it [ideologically challenged
the governments of the "Old World."]{.underline} [Today]{.underline},
despite no longer being a rising power, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[has **launched two disastrous
invasions**]{.underline}, [tortured prisoners]{.underline}, [and
dispatches **drone strikes** at a whim with little international legal
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make
a right; it is that international order is much more resilient than
critics seem to realize,26 and it is utopian to expect any rising Great
Power to act in a way that uniformly satisfies one's moral scruples,
evolving, in Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible'
status quo power."27

Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took place in the
context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but the more
important point is that the long nineteenth century (1815--1914)---the
era of America's rise---was the first iteration of the New Peace.28 The
implication is that relative peace can and has coexisted with limited
wars, property and territorial thefts, acts of coercion, and aggressive
assertions of status. This does not mean any of these are desirable---
they are not---but it shows that they need not be fatal to the system.
Insofar as there is a lesson from that first period of relative peace,
it is that Great Power confrontation is the one thing that is fatal.
Accepting this does not mean capitulating in every instance, as implied
by some,29 but it does mean rediscovering the rules of Great Power
competition30 alongside the art of strategy.31

Focusing only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the
established powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which China, has,
in fact, conformed to the existing order. As a RAND Corporation report
published in 2018 concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a
conditional one---of the international order: "Since China undertook a
policy of international engagement in the 1980s . . . the level and
quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most other
states."32 The way in which [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping, following
his 2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [[has been heralded
as the most prominent champion of international
order]{.underline}]{.mark} and defender of globalization [underscores
the fact that there are different elements of this order, and that
**[China supports many]{.mark}**]{.underline}, if not most, [[of
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Even in places where China is supposedly
"altering" the current order, [Beijing tends to simultaneously affirm
that order]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China's A]{.underline}sian
[I]{.underline}nfrastructure [I]{.underline}nvestment
[B]{.underline}ank, for instance, actually mirrors existing structures,
and China has intentionally [copied]{.underline} elements and "best
practices" of [[the World Bank]{.underline}]{.mark} and Asian
Development Bank. [China is playing the same game]{.underline}, even if
it is seeking a bigger role within it.33

#### China doesn't threaten the world order

**Odell 21**, (Rachel, "Why **[it\'s [wrong for the US to label China a
threat to the \'world order']{.mark}]{.underline}**, Responsible
Statecraft,
https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/03/20/why-its-wrong-for-the-us-to-label-china-a-threat-to-the-world-order/)

A meeting hailed as a chance to "air divisive issues" and stabilize
relations between the United States and China quickly devolved into
finger-pointing and recriminations by officials on both sides, spelling
trouble for a relationship increasingly defined by hostility and
conflict.

Addressing a group of high-level Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska
on March 18, Secretary of State Antony Blinken excoriated Chinese
officials for actions that "threaten the rules-based order that
maintains global stability." Director of the Office of the Central
Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi reciprocated with accusations
of condescension and interference in China's internal affairs.

Blinken's characterization of China as a threat to a "rules-based order"
echoes his administration's language in its Interim National Security
Strategic Guidance released March 3, as well as the Trump
administration's 2017 National Security Strategy, which labeled China an
existential threat to the U.S.-led, "free and open" world order.

While the Biden administration's China policy has improved somewhat on
the Trump administration's approach by highlighting the need for U.S.
domestic reform and admitting the need for cooperation with China in
some areas, its embrace of this conception of the international system,
or "world order," and the U.S. and Chinese relationships to it is overly
simplistic --- and dangerously [misleading]{.underline}.

This [rhetoric reflects Washington's tendency to [imagine]{.mark} the
[current world order as]{.mark} a [monolithic]{.mark}]{.underline},
liberal system of mutually-reinforcing laws, norms, institutions, and
alliances, [upheld by the United States and its allies. In this view,
states like China and Russia seek to overthrow this order and replace it
with one that is more lawless and repressive]{.underline}.

But **[[this is]{.mark} deeply [misleading]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[No
such version]{.mark} of a world order [has ever existed, nor has the
relationship of]{.mark} the United States --- or its
[adversaries]{.mark} --- to the present order ever [been]{.mark} so
[simple]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [this misconception is
perilous]{.underline}. [Vastly [overstating]{.mark} the nature of
[China's challenge]{.mark} to the current "world order" stands
to]{.underline} hinder vital U.S.-China cooperation on issues like
climate change, [[fuel]{.mark} a massive and [harmful overreaction in
American]{.mark}]{.underline} [[foreign policy]{.mark}, and]{.underline}
in the worst case could [[force China to assume a more
aggressive]{.mark} and revisionist [posture]{.mark} than it otherwise
would]{.underline}.

Instead of adopting this dangerous course, [the administration should
recognize the reality of [world order]{.mark}: that it [is]{.mark} in
fact [a series of separate and sometimes]{.mark} [contradictory
orders]{.mark}]{.underline}, governing areas from trade, to arms
control, to international humanitarian law. [Like the United States,
China has varying relationships with each of these orders]{.underline},
as Alastair Iain Johnston of Harvard University writes --- [upholding
some, while rejecting or seeking to change others]{.underline}.

Climate change, for instance, is an area that demands a cooperative
international regime for both decarbonization and disaster relief and
mitigation. It is one where collaboration with China is readily
possible. China has recently positioned itself as a leader on climate,
upholding the Paris Agreement and adopting a goal of carbon neutrality
by 2060. As the world's two largest economies, the United States and
China can lead by adopting even more ambitious goals for
decarbonization, and can provide financial and technology assistance to
developing countries to accelerate their transition to carbon neutrality
and build their climate resilience.

Similarly, in the international development regime, China is creating
new institutions and initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative, but there is room for
Washington and Beijing to coordinate productively in those contexts.

In other regimes, such as freedom of navigation, there is room for the
United States, China, and other countries to negotiate compromise
agreements to clarify existing ambiguity in international law. To
support its global naval primacy, the United States asserts a maximal
version of freedom of navigation, insisting that military vessels have
the right to "fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows."
Washington interprets the extent of that right more expansively than
most countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including many U.S. allies
and partners.

Despite U.S. rhetoric, China is not seeking to threaten freedom of
navigation for commercial vessels, upon which its economy heavily
depends. Even in the military realm, China, like the United States, is
increasingly dependent on freedom of navigation for its own warships
operating farther from its shores. If the United States were to reduce
the tempo of its surveillance operations along China's coast and freedom
of navigation operations near disputed South China Sea islands, China
would likely express stronger support for military freedom of navigation
given its own growing naval power. Meanwhile, Washington and Beijing
could work with other countries throughout the Indo-Pacific to reach a
compromise understanding about the rights of foreign military vessels in
exclusive economic zones.

Of course, China's approach to other aspects of the law of the sea
regime related to marine resources is more revisionist. This is most
evident in its ill-defined claim to historic rights in the South China
Sea and its claim to resources in vast swaths of ocean space around
groups of small disputed offshore islands. These excessive claims merit
pushback, but the United States should follow ASEAN's lead in calling
for the South China Sea disputes to be resolved in accordance with
UNCLOS, rather than conducting unilateral freedom of navigation
operations that risk destabilizing the situation.

Finally, in the global regimes related to human rights and domestic
governance, the United States should counter China's influence by
deepening its engagement to strengthen and reform those regimes. In
regimes that are not yet fully formed, such as internet governance,
China is trying to shape norms in ways that favor state sovereignty and
control. The United States should vigorously defend its own prerogatives
and priorities in this regime --- some of which it has yet to sort out
at a domestic level, but which ought to entail a more open and less
government-dominated approach to internet governance.

In other areas where China is acting as a conservative power resisting
liberal norm revision, such as with its resistance to the
"responsibility to protect" norm, the United States should emphasize the
need for the international community to work together to respond to
gross humanitarian violations. At the same time, Washington should
recognize that its heavy use of economic sanctions to punish human
rights abuses and its militarized humanitarian interventions not only
often cause direct unintended humanitarian harm, but also have the
predictable consequence of strengthening resistance to such liberal norm
revision. If Washington desires to strengthen liberal human rights
norms, it ought to adopt a more liberal diplomacy-centric approach that
relies on soft power and modeling, in lieu of economic and military
coercion.

As [the United States]{.underline} seeks to adapt to a more multipolar
global system and an increasingly powerful and important China, it
[should [avoid]{.mark} the both [inaccurate and harmful portrayal of
China]{.mark} as a threat to the overall world order.]{.underline} [A
more fine-grained understanding and less Manichean rhetoric will help
the United States make better strategy]{.underline} --- [avoiding Cold
War-style competition, while identifying where to focus our efforts in
both working with and against the Chinese government]{.underline}.
