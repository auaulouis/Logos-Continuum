[[A goal of feminist science is to open up new avenues]{.mark} of
thinking and analysis [while attending to gender]{.mark} and other forms
of bias [by building on the social study of scienc]{.mark}e]{.underline}
(Pickering, 1992). Feminist science [focuses specifically on issues of
representation and diversity in the sciences]{.underline}, serving as an
adoptable method of practice by providing tools to increase inclusivity.

[We apply Feminist Contextual Empiricism (FCE)]{.underline} (Longino,
1990, 2019; Longino and Lennon, 1997), which is rooted in the premise
that science is value-laden (wherein objectivity and impartiality are
established norms) and [argues that [an important goal of science is to
pursue better values]{.mark}.]{.underline} FCE expands upon the values
of accuracy, consistency, broad scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness
(Kuhn, 1977[) to [embrace equity and justic]{.mark}e wherein truth is
achieved through discursive consensus formation. [By explicitly
including multiple interpretations]{.mark} of the same phenomena, values
and underlying assumptions are laid bare, revealing the evidence bases
for arguments and theorie]{.underline}s (Longino, 1990). Although the
original iteration of FCE focused on gender differences in experiential
knowledge and the unequal power relations in which women are enmeshed,
it has since grown (in some cases converging with other avenues of
thought) to encompass additional feminist values including heterogeneity
and mutuality of interaction in which plurality and complexity of
explanation are prioritized. FCE also contends that research must be
applicable to human needs, for example, aiming to alleviate misery
(Longino, 1996). These norms do not constitute a fundamentally new
approach to science, but rather an evolution that is consistent with the
idea of scientific revolution (Longino, 1987).

At the root of FCE is the accumulated experiential knowledge of women
stemming from their engagements with unequal relations of power (both
interpersonal and structural[). The biases women face are persistent,
pervasive, and in many cases can be overtly hostile (NASEM, 2020). The
understanding that emerges out of these experiences can be used as a
resource]{.underline}. Similar examples of power disparities that
commonly occur in research environments include those of race,
nationality, wealth, sexuality, career stage, and geography. In science,
[it is often the case that the perspectives of the marginalized are
repressed in favor of the dominant group,]{.underline} which can stifle
creativity, diminish the agency of the workforce and, in some cases,
result in the persistence of harmful lines of thought (Lloyd,
2009; Metoyer and Rust, 2011; Young et al., 2019). [[Rather than
enduring t]{.mark}he [dominance]{.mark} of one kind experience or
background or, in extreme cases, the assertion that one set of views or
conclusions is "right," [FCE provides a pathway for incorporating
pluralism]{.mark}, i]{.underline}ncluding multiple sources of hypotheses
and analyses into research resulting in a more holistic understanding of
the problem at hand (Wylie, 2007). This is what makes feminist
empiricism not *feminine* (thereby eschewing gender essentialism),
but *feminist.* FCE is fundamentally about examining how scientists
practice science, specifically how research is conducted in a way that
is consistent with the scientists' values (Longino, 1987, 1990[). [In
addition to]{.mark} a practice by which [science]{.mark} is
performed]{.underline}, FCE (and frameworks like it that focus on
inclusion of a variety of perspectives) [[can be used as a tool to
reevaluate]{.mark} previous [studies]{.mark} or conclusions [to
obtain]{.mark} stronger or [more actionable
results]{.mark}]{.underline}. (We note that while FCE is founded in
issues of gender, it retains applicability to race and class, providing
space for intersectional analysis going forward.)

In addition, feminist science contends that a critical aspect of
feminist critique involves the re-examination of biased language (e.g.
metaphors and descriptions) that shape scientific practice. Scientific
practice is often a reflection of society, including societal gender
bias, and in turn science can serve as justification for gender
discrimination (Sheets, 2003), including in solar geoengineering (Buck
et al., 2014; Sax, 2019).

### 2AC\-\--Climate Turns Fem K

#### The aff is key. Climate crises disproportionately effect women so absent the aff we are sentencing them to further suffering

**Abid et al. 18**\-\--PhD researcher for University College, London
with a Doctor of Philosophy in Sustainable Resources (Zaineb, Muhammad
Abid, Qudsia Zafar, and Shahbaz Mehmood; "Detrimental Effects of Climate
Change on Women", Springer Nature, 7/30/18,
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41748-018-0063-9#Sec2>) sh

As mentioned earlier, [the [temperature of earth is increasing rapidly
leading]{.mark} to Global [warming and melting of ice caps.]{.mark} As a
consequence, the rise in sea-level, extinction of species, changes in
rainfall and humidity patterns are being observed]{.underline}. All
these [are [contributing to]{.mark} frequently occurring [natural
disasters]{.mark} such as droughts, famines, floods, cyclones,
hurricanes, typhoons, mudslides,]{.underline} etc., and also slowly
occurring disasters such as desertification and salinization of coastal
areas. According to Sir John Holmes, in the last 20 years, the number of
natural disasters recorded has increased from 200 to 400 per year and
about nine out of every ten natural disasters are related to climate
(Holmes J, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and
Emergency Relief Coordinator 2008[). The [primary consequence of natural
disasters is]{.mark} disturbed patterns of human settlement, [migration
or displacement.]{.mark} Other consequences of natural disasters include
[health issues and deaths]{.mark}, loss of shelter, poverty,
agricultural losses, loss of education and empowerment]{.underline}.

[It has been found that [women and children are the major
consequence-bearer of natural disasters.]{.mark} They face many social,
educational and employment, privacy and health issues.]{.underline}
Majorly, [they [face poverty more than men as a consequence]{.mark} of
[disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a research, **[death rate
of women and children is 14 times greater than that of men in natural
disasters]{.underline}** (Soroptimist International of the Americas
2008). In 2004 Asian tsunami, 70% of the dead were women (Soroptimist
International of the Americas 2008) and as per another report, women
were 80% of the dead in 2004 tsunami of Asia (APWLD 2005). Of 140,000
people killed in 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, mortality rate of women above
age 40 was 31% greater (Bern et al. 1993). In Hurricane Katrina that hit
USA in 2005, [more women lost their livelihoods in comparison to men and
formed the poorest and marginalized part of the community]{.underline}.
A study shows that among 180,000 people who lost their livelihoods in
Louisiana, 103,000 were women (Ginn 2009). 87% unmarried women and 100%
married women lost their source of income by cyclone Nargis that hit
Ayeyarwaddy Delta in Myanmar in 2008 (British Red Cross on Relief Web
2009). More women died as compared to men in 2003 European heat-wave and
in Indonesia and Sri Lanka 2006 tsunami (Araujo et al. 2008).

[Natural disasters are also increasing the prevalence of water-borne
diseases. This also increases rate of mortality and morbidity and
aggravates women's care-giving responsibilities. In addition,
post-disaster studies show that [women are less likely to be
given]{.mark} quality health[-care after disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}
(World Health Organization (WHO) 2008). Women are, therefore, more
likely to contract diseases after natural disasters.

Men own most of the agricultural lands and houses so their losses are
recorded, but losses other than these are never considered. However,
women lose their kitchen utensils, sewing machines, small animals and
any other productive assets they have that make them more dependent on
men (Bradshaw and Fordham 2013). Depletion in natural resources
increases women's workload with more distance to travel for wood, water
and food collection. This leaves women with no time for
income-generating activities. Sometimes, women have to sacrifice
themselves for the sake of their families with declining quantity and
quality of food (Masika 2002).

[Many factors have been listed as a cause of women's vulnerability to
natural disasters. Lack of resources and poverty contribute to their
vulnerability.]{.underline} A study conducted by International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies shows that in
low-income countries, people are 4 times more prone to dying in natural
events as compared to people in high-income countries (World Disasters
Report 1993). Since women form the major part of world poor, they are
more vulnerable to natural disasters than men. Certain social aspects of
a society also play an important role in determining the vulnerability.
As per study conducted in Orissa, India about the vulnerability of women
to floods show that it is difficult to study various aspects of
vulnerability without taking into account the place and its class,
gender and ethnicity concepts (Arora-Jonsson 2011). In many areas, [[the
notion of]{.mark} socially constructed '[dependence of women on
men']{.mark}, economic disadvantage, gender discrimination in ownership,
access and control of land and resources, limited decision-making, lower
literacy rates [make them susceptible to damage during natural
disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Cultural and religious
restrictions on women's mobility also hamper their timely escape at
times of disasters. For example, it was reported that during floods,
many women did not leave their houses as it was considered socially and
culturally inappropriate and some of the women who tried to escape died
because they did not know how to swim (Rohr 2006). In their analysis of
up to 141 countries conducted between 1981 and 2002, Neumayer and
Plumper found that the extent of socially constructed vulnerability also
determines women's vulnerability to disasters as compared to male life
expectancy and that women are more likely to die if they are more
economically disadvantaged (Neumayer and Plumper 2007). Kafi points out
that there are no laws to protect women rights in some countries and
even if there are some legal provisions, women are not literate enough
to claim their rights and do not have any financial resources. (Kafi et
al. 1992). Men are preferred over women in post-disaster treatment
resulting in more suffering of food shortages, toilets and bathing
facilities and sleeping arrangements for women (Swarup et al. 2011).
Similarly in 1991, no official warning to women regarding cyclone in
Bangladesh was given whereas men were totally aware as they were
informed in public places, but these warnings were seldom communicated
on to their families. This indicates social injustice and general gender
inequality in society (Rohr 2006). This limits women's coping capacity
and decreases their resilience
(https://www.karat.org/wp-content/uploads/ 2012) to the natural
disasters.

2.5 Women, Climate Change and Wars

[[Another consequence]{.mark} that is usually not considered when
listing effects of climate change is [increase in wars and
conflict]{.mark}s all over the world]{.underline}. Climate change is
resulting in extinction of species, water resources and prevalence of
droughts and famines. Thus, survival instinct of nations forces them to
fight against each other to get food, water, and other necessary
resources. It is generally said that third world war will be due to the
shortage of water. Harald Welzer, the author of the book 'Climate Wars:
Why People Will Be Killed in the 21st Century', said 'My belief is that
we will see renaissance of violent conflict in the 21st century, and
that many of these conflicts will spring from climate change (Illing
2017)'.

Marcus King, a professor at George Washington University's Elliott
School of International Affairs who authored the chapter on
'weaponizing' water, said that in coming years, water shortages might
also lead to interstate war. Over the issue of damming River Nile,
Ethiopia has already been threatened by Egypt with air strikes (Aton and
American 2017). Marco Sánchez Cantillo at the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization says that 'There's no doubt that there's a clear
interaction between climate change and conflict". He further added that
"They work together to accelerate and deepen the severity of hunger".
Marco in his report pointed out that the number of undernourished people
in the world increased yearly from 2003 to 2016. In 2015, there were 777
million undernourished people, while the number increased to 815 million
in 2016. About 489 million undernourished people among these were in
those countries which had high conflict rate. The report also blames
droughts to be the cause of conflicts and food crisis in Afghanistan,
Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Syria. Thus, today about 53.5 million
people have no reliable food source (Coghlan 2017). War on natural
resources is already underway in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan
according to Pentagon's study of climate change (Military Advisory
Board, The CAN Corporation 2007). Gwyn Kirk of Women for Genuine
Security has reported that America is fighting war against Iraq to get
hold of its oil and use it continuously. All over the world, an increase
in greenhouse gas emissions is being observed due to militaristic
acquisition and unjust use of natural resources. Hence, climate
instability and depletion of resources is increasing leading to more
wars and even further climate instability (Roberts 2009). In 2000, under
\$300 billion were spent by United States military, but in 2008, it
spent \$700 billion. Greenhouse gas emissions and military spending has
surpassed all previous levels (Sharp 2009). During 3-week combat in
Iraq, about 40 million gallons of fuel were burnt by army. It means
about 2 million gallons were burnt per day, which is an amount equal to
total gasoline consumption of all the Allied armies during World War I
(Roberts 2009).

[The [majority of the people affected during war are women and
children]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is because they are solely left
responsible to feed their families when their husbands, sons or male
members of the house are killed during wars. [[All burden falls on them.
They]{.mark} also [face sexual violence]{.mark} at the hands of male
soldiers. Sometimes, they are [forced to leave their houses and
migrate]{.mark} to faraway places.]{.underline} So, they suffer from
poverty and are left with no other choice than to hold a beggar's bowl.
[[Domestic violence becomes prevalent]{.mark} [when
normalization]{.mark} of militarism and [violence]{.mark} in a society
takes place. Thus, whenever situation of war arises[, it is women, whose
rights are mostly ]{.mark}]{.underline}~~crippled~~
[[\[crushed\],]{.mark} demeaning the status of women even
more]{.underline} (Roberts 2009).

[Geoengineering not only fails to address the root causes of the climate
crisis but risks accelerating ecosystem collapse and species
extinction.]{.underline} [It could also severely compromise our ability
to bring the biosphere back to a state where it can better regulate
climate conditions and provide vital ecosystem functions.]{.underline}

• [Geoengineering technologies, if deployed at scale, could have
profound, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible effects on
biodiversity, both through their direct impacts and as a result of
compounding and exacerbating existing planetary crises caused by
pollution, climate change, and unsustainable land use.]{.underline}

• If deployed at scale, geoengineering technologies would likely cause a
[range of harmful impacts, including changes in precipitation, uneven
cooling, and oxygen depletion, as well as degrade nutrient cycling,
weaken the ozone, and disrupt food webs with significant deleterious
impacts on biodiversity and human well-being globally.]{.underline}

• [As it is impossible to **test geoengineering technologies** for their
intended impact on the climate except through large-scale deployment,

[In short, solar geoengineering deployment cannot be governed globally
in a fair, inclusive, and effective manner. We therefore call for
**immediate political action from governments**, the United Nations, and
other actors to prevent the normalization of solar geoengineering as a
climate policy option.]{.underline} Governments and the United Nations
should take effective political control and restrict the development of
solar geoengineering technologies before it is too late. [We **advocate
for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering
specifically targeted against the development and deployment of such
technologies** at planetary scale.]{.underline}

The International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering [should
commit governments to five core prohibitions and measures:]{.underline}

The commitment to [prohibit their national funding agencies from
supporting the development of technologies for solar geoengineering,
domestically and through international institutions.]{.underline}

The commitment to [ban outdoor experiments of solar geoengineering
technologies in areas under their jurisdiction.]{.underline}

The commitment to [not grant patent rights for technologies for solar
geoengineering, including supporting technologies such as for the
retrofitting of airplanes for aerosol injections.]{.underline}

The commitment to [not deploy technologies for solar geoengineering if
developed by third parties.]{.underline}

The commitment to [object to future institutionalization of planetary
solar geoengineering as a policy option in relevant international
institutions, including assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change.]{.underline}

[An International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering would not
prohibit atmospheric or climate research as such, and it would not place
broad limitations on academic freedom.]{.underline} [The agreement would
instead focus solely on a specific set of measures targeted purely at
restricting the development of solar geoengineering technologies under
the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.]{.underline}

[International political control over the development of contested,
high-stakes technologies with planetary risks is not unprecedented. The
international community has a rich history of international restrictions
and moratoria over activities and technologies judged to be too
dangerous or undesirable. This history demonstrates that international
bans on the development of specific technologies do not limit legitimate
research or stifle scientific innovation.]{.underline} [In addition, an
International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering could include
exceptions for less dangerous approaches, for example by allowing the
use of localized surface albedo-related technologies that pose few
cross-regional or global risks.]{.underline}

[In sum, **an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering
would be timely, feasible, and effective.**]{.underline} [It would
**inhibit further normalization** and development of a risky and poorly
understood set of technologies that seek to intentionally manage
incoming sunlight at planetary scale.]{.underline} [And it would do so
without restricting legitimate climate research. Decarbonization of our
economies is feasible if the right steps are taken.]{.underline} Solar
geoengineering is not necessary. Neither is it desirable, ethical, or
politically governable in the current context.

[Given the increasing normalization of solar geoengineering research,
**a strong political message to block these technologies is required. An
International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering is needed
now.**]{.underline}

#### Regulations and voluntary agreements fail and undermine the treaty

Third, [the current global governance system is unfit to develop and
implement the far-reaching agreements needed to maintain fair,
inclusive, and effective political control over solar geoengineering
deployment.]{.underline} The United Nations General Assembly, the United
Nations Environment Programme or the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change are all [incapable of guaranteeing equitable and
effective multilateral control over deployment of solar geoengineering
technologies at planetary scale.]{.underline} The United Nations
Security Council, dominated by only five countries with veto power,
lacks the global legitimacy that would be required to effectively
regulate solar geoengineering deployment.

[These **concerns also arise with informal governance arrangements such
as multi-stakeholder dialogues or voluntary codes of
conduct**.]{.underline} [Informal arrangements face barriers to entry by
less powerful actors and risk contributing to premature legitimization
of these speculative technologies.]{.underline} [Science networks are
dominated by a few industrialized countries, with less economically
powerful countries having little or no direct control over them.
Technocratic governance based on expert commissions cannot adjudicate
complex global conflicts over values, risk allocation and differences in
risk acceptance that arise within the context of solar
geoengineering.]{.underline}

[Without effective global and democratic controls, the geopolitics of
possible unilateral deployment of solar geoengineering would be
frightening and inequitable.]{.underline} Given the anticipated low
monetary costs of some of these technologies, [there is a risk that a
few powerful countries would engage in solar geoengineering unilaterally
or in small coalitions even when a majority of countries oppose such
deployment.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Solvency

#### Policymakers should ban geoengineering

What Policymakers Should Do to Stop Geoengineering

[Geoengineering can never be meaningfully tested for its intended impact
on the climate other than through large-scale deployment.]{.underline}
These highly speculative technologies do nothing to tackle the root
causes of the climate crisis and, in fact, risk delaying action to cut
emissions by presenting the false possibility of a quick fix. The
proposition, therefore, is to turn the Earth into a laboratory, risking
a range of new, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible impacts and
putting essentially everyone's fundamental human rights at risk.
[Existing governance is highly precautionary and restrictive, for very
good reason, but it is being undermined by those pushing research and
experiments.]{.underline}

[Momentum is growing to build on and strengthen the existing governance
framework towards Non-Use. **More than 500 leading academics from over
50 countries are calling for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar
Geoengineering**, on the basis that such an undertaking would be
impossible to ever fairly and effectively govern. A non-use agreement
would reject deployment, outdoor experiments, and patenting and stop
taxpayer funds from supporting the development of solar geoengineering
technologies.]{.underline}

[**Political support for Non-Use is increasing**, with the African
Ministerial Conference on the Environment and the European Parliament
calling for a non-use mechanism, along with support in the Pacific
Islands, led by Vanuatu and Fiji. Germany has also expressed its
willingness for dialogue on a non-use agreement, while the EU backed the
Africa Group's position during the controversial negotiations on solar
radiation management resolution at the sixth session of the United
Nations Environment Assembly earlier this year. **Nearly 2000 civil
society organizations also endorse a non-use agreement.**]{.underline}

[Globally inclusive decision-making and political control over solar
geoengineering would be especially important for the poorest and most
vulnerable countries.]{.underline} Six-hundred and ninety-six million
people live in extreme poverty, on less than USD 1.90 a day, and 3.2
billion people live on less than USD 5.50 a day (Aguilar et al., 2021).
Over 820 million people suffer from hunger, which is equal to one in
every nine people worldwide (UN Food and Agriculture Organization,
2019). These global poor are extremely vulnerable to any change in their
environment and threatened the most by any risks or side effects that
might result from the deployment of solar geoengineering at planetary
scale. [Conversely, the global poor would also be the first to suffer
from drastic climate change.]{.underline} Various researchers have
argued that this suffering could be alleviated by solar geoengineering
(Harding et al., 2020; Wagner, 2021), leading some to postulate a moral
obligation of industrialized countries to engage in solar geoengineering
research to compensate for past and current greenhouse gas emissions
(Svoboda et al., 2018). [Yet one cannot achieve climate justice by
addressing one aspect of justice and violating another (Schlosberg &
Collins, 2014). While historical responsibility for the inequitable
impacts of climate change is an important demand of climate justice, so
is inclusion and participation in planetary-scale decisions. Both the
all-affected principle of democracy and procedural justice require
governance that is globally inclusive.]{.underline}

[Because of the high vulnerability of the least developed countries and
many other countries in the Global South, their governments would need
to have decisive control over whether and how to deploy solar
geoengineering technologies. Yet **there is little evidence to suggest
that countries most able to develop technologies for solar
geoengineering would be willing to transfer effective control of such
geopolitically important technologies to the most vulnerable countries
in the Global South.**]{.underline} [Considering the stakes for the
Global South, mere consultation of least developed and other developing
countries over technology development and potential deployment---as
suggested by some proponents of solar geoengineering---would not be
sufficient.]{.underline} Full knowledge integration for the Global South
is important, for sure (Rahman et al., 2018; Winickoff et al., 2015).
But eventually, it is effective and enforceable political control by the
Global South that would be required.

[To guarantee such globally inclusive and effective governance,
countries powerful enough to develop and deploy technologies for solar
geoengineering would need to place their technologies under the control
of effective multilateral institutions, with guarantees of collective
veto rights for the most vulnerable nations. **The current world order
seems unfit to reach such far-reaching agreements on fair and effective
political control over solar geoengineering deployment**.]{.underline}
The United Nations General Assembly, as the highest organ of the world
organization, declared climate change in 1988 a "common concern of
humankind", but the assembly lacks enforcement powers and its decisions
are not binding. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) with
its United Nations Environment Assembly, which deals with many
environmental issues, is constrained in its mandate and operational
capacity. In 2019, a proposed UNEP resolution to undertake a cautionary
assessment of geoengineering options, including solar geoengineering,
was blocked by the United States, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia (Chemnick,
2019). Like the United Nations General Assembly, the United BIERMANN ET

Creative Commons License Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
also lacks the institutional force that could guarantee just, equitable
and effective multilateral control over deployment of solar
geoengineering technologies at planetary scale.

[In addition, any global decisions on the details of the deployment of
solar geoengineering are unlikely to find consensus.]{.underline}
[Disagreements about some parameters---for example, the degree of
cooling, the duration of deployment, or the specific latitudes and
distribution of aerosols---will inevitably occur.]{.underline} Such
situations would require clear and reliable decision-making procedures
for solving these disagreements. [Most United Nations bodies follow the
principle of sovereign equality, which grants each country one vote. It
is unlikely that technologically advanced nations such as the United
States or Russia would accept such a system of oversight for
planetary-scale use of solar geoengineering.]{.underline} **[Universally
accepted alternatives to one-country-one-vote decision-making, however,
are not in sight.]{.underline}**

Importantly, any decision by a global body to deploy solar
geoengineering technologies would require enforcement power in case some
countries disagree with a majority decision and threaten counteractions.
The literature even discusses scenarios of counter-geoengineering by
countries that disagree with the solar geoengineering programs of other
countries (Heyen et al., 2019). The United Nations Security Council has
a mandate to act if it deems a situation to be a threat to international
peace and security. Yet the Security Council, with five countries having
permanent seats and veto rights, does not enjoy the global legitimacy to
effectively regulate future global deployment of solar geoengineering
technologies. And it cannot take actions against any of its five
permanent members (i.e., China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and
the United States).

These concerns about formal governance also arise with more informal
governance arrangements, such as multi-stakeholder dialogues or
voluntary codes of conduct (Jinnah et al., 2019). Such arrangements face
similar barriers to entry by less powerful actors, and they risk
contributing to premature legitimization of these speculative
technologies as well (Conca, 2019). Science networks in general are
heavily biased towards a few industrialized countries, with less
economically powerful countries having little or no direct control over
them (Biermann & Möller, 2019; Stephens et al., 2021). [Moreover,
technocratic **governance based on expert commissions or scientific
modeling of distributive consequences cannot adjudicate complex global
conflicts over values**, risk allocation, and differences in risk
acceptance]{.underline} (Flegal & Gupta, 2018).

With international efforts on climate action still not on track to limit
warming to 1.5°C, technological fixes that aim to intentionally alter
the Earth's climate, such as solar geoengineering, might seem like
appealing options for tackling global warming. [But they come with
questions in terms of feasibility, impacts and risks, governance and
geopolitics, and who may or may not benefit.]{.underline}

Crucially, no mature solar geoengineering technology exists today. [And
even if solar geoengineering was deployed, **it would not reverse or
halt climate change but create a different, engineered climate
future.**]{.underline}

[Solar geoengineering would result in **new and additional impacts on
and risks to human and natural systems**, mainly driven by changes in
temperature, precipitation and extreme events. These would be
distributed unequally, with regions already most vulnerable to climate
impacts disproportionately affected.]{.underline}

[And, as solar geoengineering does not cut emissions, non-temperature
related impacts associated with continuing emissions would also
continue, including ocean acidification. Also, **it would put the world
at risk of a sudden rise in global temperatures if solar geoengineering
suddenly ends or fails -- the \"termination shock\".**]{.underline}

[Geoengineering research has always been controversial for precisely
these reasons.]{.underline} Countless scientists and experts have warned
that the approach could cause far-reaching unintended consequences.
[Studies show, for example, that it could disrupt climate and weather
patterns, leading to severe droughts, hurricanes, and other extreme
weather. These risks are unpredictable, and their effects would be
unequally distributed.]{.underline}

[In fact, solar geoengineering would amplify existing global power
imbalances, not least because decisions about its deployment would be
made primarily by rich countries in the Global North]{.underline} -- the
same countries that created the climate crisis. These countries nurtured
a deadly phenomenon, the burden of which is falling disproportionately
on vulnerable communities, and now they propose a highly risky strategy
that, even in the best-case scenario, would not solve the problem.

[None of these objections has prevented millions of dollars from being
funneled -- largely by tech and finance billionaires -- into solar
geoengineering initiatives. Proponents suggest that such initiatives are
a temporary fix, a way to buy more time for mitigation and adaptation.

appealing but illusory.]{.underline}

#### Geoengineering is terrible for the environment 

-Regional climate, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, plants, acid
deposition, solar power, and rapid warming

**Robock '08** (Alan Robock, currently a Professor in the Department of
Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University, 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, a
Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1977) in Meteorology,
May 1, 2008 "20 reasons why geoengineering may be a bad idea Carbon
dioxide emissions are rising so fast that some scientists are seriously
considering putting Earth on life support as a last resort. But is this
cure worse than the disease?" Rutgers University
<https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/20Reasons.pdf>); LF

Two strategies to reduce incoming solar radiation---[stratospheric
aerosol injection as proposed by Crutzen and space-based sun shields
(i.e., mirrors or shades placed in orbit between the sun and
Earth)---are among the most widely discussed geoengineering schemes in
scientific circles.]{.underline} While these schemes (if they could be
built) would cool Earth, [they might also have adverse
consequences]{.underline}. Several papers in the August 2006 Climatic
Change discussed some of these issues, but here I present a fairly
comprehensive list of reasons why geoengineering might be a bad idea,
first written down during a two-day NASA20 reasons why geoengineering
may be a bad idea Carbon dioxide emissions are rising so fast that some
scientists are seriously considering putting Earth on life support as a
last resort. But is this cure worse than the disease? These concerns
address unknowns in climate system response; effects on human quality of
life; and the political, ethical, and moral issues raised.

[1. Effects on regional climate.]{.underline} [Geoengineering proponents
often suggest that volcanic eruptions are an innocuous natural analog
for stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosols.]{.underline} The 1991
eruption of Mount Pinatubo on the Philippine island of Luzon, which
injected 20 megatons of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere,
produced a sulfate aerosol cloud that is said to have caused global
cooling for a couple of years without adverse effects. [However,
researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research showed in
2007 that the Pinatubo eruption caused large hydrological responses,
including reduced precipitation, soil moisture, and river flow in many
regions.5 Simulations of the climate response to volcanic eruptions have
also shown large impacts on regional climate]{.underline}, but whether
these are good analogs for the geoengineering response requires further
investigation.

Scientists have also seen volcanic eruptions in the tropics produce
changes in atmospheric circulation, [causing winter warming over
continents in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as eruptions at high
latitudes weaken the Asian and African monsoons, causing reduced
precipitation]{.underline}.6 In fact, the eight-monthlong eruption of
the Laki fissure in Iceland in 1783--1784 contributed to famine in
Africa, India, and Japan.

If scientists and engineers were able to inject smaller amounts of
stratospheric aerosols than result from volcanic eruptions, how would
they affect summer wind and precipitation patterns? Could attempts to
geoengineer isolated regions (say, the Arctic) be confined there?
Scientists need to investigate these scenarios. [At the fall 2007
American Geophysical Union meeting, researchers presented preliminary
findings from several different climate models that simulated
geoengineering schemes and found that they reduced precipitation over
wide regions, condemning hundreds of millions of people to
drought.]{.underline}

[2. Continued ocean acidification.]{.underline}

If humans adopted geoengineering as a solution to global warming, with
no restriction on continued carbon emissions, the ocean would continue
to become more acidic, [because about half of all excess carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere is removed by ocean uptake. The ocean is already 30
percent more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, and
continued acidification threatens the entire oceanic biological chain,
from coral reefs right up to humans.7]{.underline}

[3. Ozone depletion. Aerosol particles in the stratosphere serve as
surfaces for chemical reactions that destroy ozone in the same way that
water and nitric acid aerosols in polar stratospheric clouds produce the
seasonal Antarctic ozone hole]{.underline}.8 For the next four decades
or so, when the concentration of anthropogenic ozone-depleting
substances will still be large enough in the stratosphere to produce
this effect, additional aerosols from geoengineering would destroy even
more ozone and increase damaging ultraviolet flux to Earth's surface.

[4. Effects on plants. Sunlight scatters as it passes through
stratospheric aerosols, reducing direct solar radiation and increasing
diffuse radiation, with important biological consequences.]{.underline}
Some studies, including one that measured this effect in trees following
the Mount Pinatubo eruption, suggest that diffuse radiation allows plant
canopies to photosynthesize more efficiently, thus increasing their
capacity as a carbon sink.9 At the same time, inserting aerosols or
reflective disks into the atmosphere would reduce the total sunlight to
reach Earth's surface. Scientists need to assess the impacts on crops
and natural vegetation of reductions in total, diffuse, and direct solar
radiation.

[5. More acid deposition. If sulfate is injected regularly into the
stratosphere, no matter where on Earth, acid deposition will increase as
the material passes through the troposphere---the atmospheric layer
closest to Earth's surface.]{.underline} In 1977, Russian climatologist
Mikhail Budyko calculated that the additional acidity caused by sulfate
injections would be negligibly greater than levels that resulted from
air pollution.10 But the relevant quantity is the total amount of acid
that reaches the ground, including both wet (acid rain, snow, and fog)
and dry deposition (acidic gases and particles). Any additional acid
deposition would harm the ecosystem, and it will be important to
understand the consequences of exceeding different biological
thresholds. Furthermore, more acidic particles in the troposphere would
affect public health. The effect may not be large compared to the impact
of pollution in urban areas, but in pristine areas it could be
significant.

6\. Effects of cirrus clouds. As aerosol particles injected into the
stratosphere fall to Earth, they may seed cirrus cloud formations in the
troposphere.11 Cirrus clouds affect Earth's radiative balance of
incoming and outgoing heat, although the amplitude and even direction of
the effects are not well understood. While evidence exists that some
volcanic aerosols form cirrus clouds, the global effect has not been
quantified.12

7\. Whitening of the sky (but nice sunsets). [Atmospheric aerosols close
to the size of the wavelength of light produce a white, cloudy
appearance to the sky]{.underline}. They also contribute to colorful
sunsets, similar to those that occur after volcanic eruptions. The red
and yellow sky in The Scream by Edvard Munch was inspired by the
brilliant sunsets he witnessed over Oslo in 1883, following the eruption
of Krakatau in Indonesia.13 [Both the disappearance of blue skies and
the appearance of red sunsets could have strong psychological impacts on
humanity.]{.underline}

8[. Less sun for solar power. Scientists estimate that as little as a
1.8 percent reduction in incoming solar radiation would compensate for a
doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Even this small reduction would
significantly affect the radiation available for solar power
systems---one of the prime alternate methods of generating clean
energy--- as the response of different solar power systems to total
available sunlight is not linear.]{.underline} This is especially true
for some of the most efficiently designed systems that reflect or focus
direct solar radiation on one location for direct heating.14 Following
the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1982 eruption of El Chichón in
Mexico, scientists observed a direct solar radiation decrease of 25--35
percent.15

[9. Environmental impacts of implementation]{.underline}. [Any system
that could inject aerosols into the stratosphere, i.e., commercial
jetliners with sulfur mixed into their fuel, 16-inch naval rifles firing
1-ton shells of dust vertically into the air, or hoses suspended from
stratospheric balloons, would cause enormous environmental
damage.]{.underline} [The same could be said for systems that would
deploy sun capitalizing on carbon. Without market incentives,
geoengineering schemes to reflect solar heat are still largely confined
to creative thought and artists' renderings.]{.underline} But a few
ambitious entrepreneurs have begun to experiment with privatizing
climate mitigation through carbon sequestration. Here are a few
companies in the market to offset your carbon footprint:
California-based technology startups Planktos and Climos are perhaps the
most prominent groups offering to sell carbon offsets in exchange for
performing ocean iron fertilization, which induces blooms of
carbon-eating phytoplankton. Funding for Planktos dried up in early 2008
as scientists grew increasingly skeptical about the technique, but
Climos has managed to press on, securing \$3.5 million in funding from
Braemar Energy Ventures as of February. Also in the research and
development phase is Sydney, Australia--based Ocean Nourishment
Corporation, which similarly aims to induce oceanic photosynthesis, only
it fertilizes with nitrogen-rich urea instead of iron. Atmocean, based
in Santa Fe, New Mexico, takes a slightly different tack: It's developed
a 200-meter deep, wave-powered pump that brings colder, more biota-rich
water up to the surface where lifeforms such as tiny, tube-like salps
sequester carbon as they feed on algae. Related in mission if not in
name, stationary carbon-capture technologies, which generally aren't
considered geoengineering, are nonetheless equally inventive: Skyonic, a
Texas-based startup, captures carbon dioxide at power plants (a
relatively wellproven technology) and mixes it with sodium hydroxide to
render high-grade baking soda. A pilot version of the system is
operating at the Brown Stream Electric Station in Fairfield, Texas. To
the west in Tucson, Arizona, Global Research Technologies, the only
company in the world dedicated to carbon capture from ambient air,
recently demonstrated a working "air extraction" prototype---a kind of
carbon dioxide vacuum that stands upright and is about the size of a
phone booth. Meanwhile, GreenFuel Technologies Corporation, in
collaboration with Arizona Public Service Company, is recycling carbon
dioxide emissions from power plants by using it to grow biofuel stock in
the form of---what else?---algae. KIRSTEN JERCH MAY/JUNE 2008 Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists 17 shields. University of Arizona astronomer
Roger P. Angel has proposed putting a fleet of 2-foot-wide reflective
disks in a stable orbit between Earth and the sun that would bend
sunlight away from Earth.16 [But to get the needed trillions of disks
into space, engineers would need 20 electromagnetic launchers to fire
missiles with stacks of 800,000 disks every five minutes for twenty
years. What would be the atmospheric effects of the resulting sound and
gravity waves? Who would want to live nearby?]{.underline}

10\. [**Rapid warming if deployment stops.** A technological, societal,
or political crisis could halt a project of stratospheric aerosol
injection in middeployment. Such an abrupt shift would result in rapid
climate warming, which would produce much more stress on society and
ecosystems than gradual global warming.17]{.underline}

#### Geoengineering fails 

-tipping points, human error, undermining mitigation, cost, control of
tech

**Robock '08** (Alan Robock, currently a Professor in the Department of
Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University, 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, a
Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1977) in Meteorology,

11\. There's no going back. We don't know how quickly scientists and
engineers could shut down a geoengineering system---or stem its
effects---in the event of excessive climate cooling from large volcanic
eruptions or other causes. Once we put aerosols into the atmosphere, we
cannot remove them.

12\. Human error. Complex mechanical systems never work perfectly.
Humans can make mistakes in the design, manufacturing, and operation of
such systems. (Think of Chernobyl, the Exxon Valdez, airplane crashes,
and friendly fire on the battlefield.) Should we stake the future of
Earth on a much more complicated arrangement than these, built by the
lowest bidder?

13\. Undermining emissions mitigation. If humans perceive an easy
technological fix to global warming that allows for "business as usual,"
gathering the national (particularly in the United States and China) and
international will to change consumption patterns and energy
infrastructure will be even more difficult.18 This is the oldest and
most persistent argument against geoengineering.

14\. Cost. Advocates casually claim that it would not be too expensive
to implement geoengineering solutions, but there have been no definitive
cost studies, and estimates of large-scale government projects are
almost always too low. (Boston's "Big Dig" to reroute an interstate
highway under the coastal city, one of humankind's greatest engineering
feats, is only one example that was years overdue and billions over
budget.) Angel estimates that his scheme to launch reflective disks into
orbit would cost "a few trillion dollars." British economist Nicholas
Stern's calculation of the cost of climate change as a percentage of
global GDP (roughly \$9 trillion) is in the same ballpark; Angel's
estimate is also orders of magnitude greater than current global
investment in renewable energy technology. Wouldn't it be a safer and
wiser investment for society to instead put that money in solar power,
wind power, energy efficiency, and carbon sequestration?

15\. Commercial control of technology. Who would end up controlling
geoengineering systems? Governments? Private companies holding patents
on proprietary technology? And whose benefit would they have at heart?
These systems could pose issues analogous to those raised by
pharmaceutical companies and energy conglomerates whose products
ostensibly serve the public, but who often value shareholder profits
over the public good.

such as the right to free prior and informed consent, and the provision

and indigenous peoples can jeopardize the initiation and testing of
geoengineering solutions]{.underline} (Cooper 2023). [This is especially
relevant as **geoengineering may further enhance power asymmetries
between Indigenous Peoples and the state**, with **a risk for Indigenous
self-determination**.]{.underline} This risk is enhanced in cases where
states do not have sufficient measures in place to ensure free, prior
and informed consent (Chuffart et al. 2023). [Respecting and protecting
human and Indigenous rights before geoengineering solutions are deployed
is therefore necessary to avoid perpetuating patterns of
colonialism]{.underline} (Cooper 2023). [This is especially important as
**geoengineering is seen by some as an act of colonialism in itself, as
the geoengineering discourse often uses a "terra-nullius logic"** in
finding "remote sparsely populated areas for conducting outdoor
experiments" (Oksanen 2023, 7).]{.underline} Due to the history of
colonization, Indigenous communities in particular cannot be assumed to
trust that decisions made by others will be in their best interest
(Versen et al. 2022). Geoengineering governance therefore needs to
recognize underlying issues related to indigenous rights, such as
questions of sovereignty (Whyte 2012), and reflect these in the
governance process, should testing and deployment become a reality.

the Paris]{.underline}** Agreement's emissions-reduction targets (Ali
et al., 2017). As an alternative to expanding the supply of ores from
traditional mines on land to meet this demand, seabed mineral resources
deserve attention, particularly given the upcoming development of
regulations by the ISA under the UNCLOS (Sovacool et al., 2020).
Consonant with global goals for sustainability (UN, 2015), in
determining the choice of mineral supply, all stakeholders, including
manufacturers, consumers, and governments, should consider the
environmental and social consequences of extraction, in tandem with
economic considerations.

Here, a comprehensive comparative **[[analysis]{.mark} of climate change
impacts [showed]{.mark} a [substantially lower footprint]{.mark} [when
using]{.mark} [nodules]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Conscious of the numerous
uncertainties in key technologies being developed for carbon mitigation
in mineral production, an aggressive, global-grid decarbonization
scenario was built into the analysis. Even in that possible future,
**[this study's results [imply]{.mark} that [deep-sea]{.mark}
polymetallic [nodules]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if properly managed with
appropriate governance safeguards, **[have the potential for
[deliver]{.mark}ing a much [cleaner source of]{.mark} key technology
[metals]{.mark} [than land ores]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

The next step is to consider sustainability impacts more broadly, such
as waste, impacts on water sources, and social impacts. The use of
polymetallic nodules in fact could reduce the production of wastes,
tailings, dusts, and associated pollution of land, water, and air;
substantially reduce freshwater use; substantially reduce human
fatalities, injuries, and health effects associated with traditional
open-pit and underground mining as well as tailings-dam collapses; avoid
harming indigenous cultures; and avoid child labor (Paulikas et al.,
2020). A separate question is whether a new supply of nodule-derived
metals could indirectly impact aggregate metal consumption, nudge
investments in recycling technology and infrastructure, or have policy
externalities. Such determinations should be weighed in tandem with the
social and environmental benefits of using nodules. **[[Sourcing]{.mark}

perturbations and droughts appear to have contributed to the dissolution

Yet many proved resilient to similar stresses. For instance, the Mayan
city-state of Caracol experienced two similar droughts during its

other which coincided with a rapid and enduring crisis. The largest

including for climate change52 and international governance.53 For now,
far greater attention and research is needed on these systemic effects,
such as climate triggering conflict, political change, or even financial
crises.

Indeed, understanding 'societal fragility' is a key part of the Climate
Endgame research agenda, alongside exploring long-term extreme Earth
System states, modelling mass mortality and morbidity, and undertaking
integrated climate catastrophe assessments, which include climate change
alongside a host of other catastrophic threats and vulnerabilities.30

An existential end? Could global environmental collapse cause human
extinction?

This leads us to the central question: could combined ecological crises
cause this to be humanity's final century? Few have been bold enough to
directly broach the question. There have been many prophesied warnings,
especially within the collapse literature, but no truly comprehensive
scientific assessments. Questions of catastrophe are not directly
addressed by any relevant, international scientific institutions, such
as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or
Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

Many individual papers have mentioned the catastrophic potential of
climate change. Peer-reviewed academic studies have referred to global
warming as an "existential threat",5 "beyond catastrophic" (for above
5°C),54 and "an indisputable global catastrophe" (for above 6°C).55
While the impacts of climate change alone seem capable of causing a
global catastrophic risk, the authors never spell out how the world
would fall from such impacts to mass mortality. Importantly, the gloomy
terms are never defined, leaving it unknown as to whether the authors
believe that certain levels of warming could plausibly lead to human
extinction. These are no studies nor proofs of existential risks from
climate change, but rather indications of a lack of shared terminology.

In lieu of sustained scientific attention, the most poignant
examinations have come from popular books. Mark Lynas in Our Final
Warning concludes, based on a large-scale review of the existing
scientific literature, that 4°C could threaten a global collapse, and
5--6+°C could unravel into human extinction.56 David Wallace-Wells in
The Uninhabitable Earth guesses that, in contrast to the title, the
Earth will not become uninhabitable, and humans will survive foreseeable
levels of warming.57 Toby Ord in The Precipice suggests a 1 in 1000
chance of climate change resulting in an existential catastrophe.58
William MacAskill in What We Owe the Future suggests that "it's hard to
see how even this could lead directly to civilizational collapse".59

[The [**assessments** by]{.mark} existential risk
scholars---**[Ord]{.mark}** and **MacAskill**--- [have been]{.mark} the
**[least convincing]{.mark}** thus far. Ord uses an
**unworkable**]{.underline}, ambiguous [**definition** of existential
risk]{.underline}.60 He defines an existential risk as one that
"threatens the destruction of humanity's long-term potential". However,
what our potential is depends on one's values. Ord suggests that we
minimise existential risks first and then determine "our potential"
through a "Long Reflection". This would essentially be a centuries-long
worldwide philosophical conversation. This strategy creates a paradox:
we are supposed to minimise risks to a concept that we cannot define
until after we have reduced those risks. It is difficult---if not
impossible--- to assess climate change using this definition, as Ord
doesn't explicitly state his values, nor what "our potential" is. [His
[analysis **misses**]{.mark} much of the most [**recent science**
and]{.mark} does **not** sufficiently consider **'indirect'**
impacts]{.underline}. Moreover, the chapter does not cogently answer the
question of whether climate change will result in human extinction.
Instead, after roughly estimating the direct impacts, Ord concludes that
they will not make the entirety of Earth uninhabitable. This is an
entirely different question to the likelihood of climate change causing
human extinction. [Ord's use of a precise [**numerical figure**
is]{.mark} also largely **[baseless]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As noted
earlier, even groups of the best super-forecasters making predictions on
clearly defined questions have little accuracy after 12 months.61

MacAskill's analysis is also riddled with problems. Like Ord, he suffers
from definitional problems. He defines 'civilisational collapse' as
society losing the ability to create most industrial and post-industrial
technologies.62 This has little relation to more common definitions of
societal collapse. It also assumes that we know the full range of
potential industrial and post-industrial technologies. Worse still, like
with Ord's analysis, it replaces the question of whether climate change
will cause civilisational collapse with an easier one: will climate
change make large-scale agriculture on Earth impossible? MacAskill
concludes no. Once again, this is a different question. In short, the
coverage of climate change by the most prominent existential risk
scholars has been simplistic and disappointing.

While brave, the conclusions of Wallace-Wells and Lynas are ultimately
individual guesses with multiple shortcomings. Wallace-Wells is unclear
about how he reaches his conclusion. [[**Lynas** relies on]{.mark}
geological [**studies** and the **analogous**]{.mark} example of the
End-**[Permian]{.mark}** Extinction. [His]{.mark}]{.underline} more
pessimistic [[assessment]{.mark} appears [the **most
compelling**]{.mark}. It [has the most **thorough** grounding]{.mark} in
the **literature** [and, in]{.mark} the [face of]{.mark} deep
[**uncertainty**, relies on]{.mark} the **[most reliable]{.mark}** and
relevant geological **[precedents]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This is astute, given that studies suggest that mass extinction events
work by a threshold effect for temperature or carbon that we look likely
to exceed. One analysis from 2021 found that warming of 5.2°C would
likely result in a mass extinction event, even without considering the
other anthropogenic impacts on the Earth.63 Another study suggested that
the threshold for carbon release to result in a mass extinction event
would be crossed by most IPCC scenarios by the end of the century
(assuming a 50% uncertainty range, we may have already crossed this
precipice).64

Yet, these investigations suffer from the same problem, one that plagues
the entire study of global catastrophe and human extinction: a lack of
proven or reasonable tools and methods for discerning when a crisis
could spiral into global calamity. Few attempts have been made, with the
notable exception of the societal collapse and climate review conducted
by Richards et al., which does attempt to cautiously trace out some
pathways from impacts to conflict and mass mortality.65 Notably, these
deal only with climate change and not the broader, reinforcing web of
ecological crises, which has received less attention.

The short answer is that we do not know whether climate change or
anthropogenic ecological disruption could spiral into human extinction.
However, this is true for all the suspected causes of human extinction.
Climate and ecological crises do appear to have one of the most
concerning profiles, given their range of impacts, as well as their role
in past mass-extinction events and periods of historical turmoil. There
are enough reasons to take this question of human extinction from
ecological breakdown seriously.

For now, while uncertainty remains, it seems improbable that human
actions could extinguish the biosphere. Another mass-extinction event is
plausible, but complete annihilation of the biological realm is likely
not. Barring science fiction, the only semi-plausible direct route for
human activities to terminate all biological life is the triggering of a
runaway greenhouse effect. Lynas has suggested that such a scenario is
possible, if there are hidden, extreme positive feedback loops in the
climate system, an enormous, profligate use of fossil fuels, and
increasing solar radiation.66 Some basic modelling of the climate system
has suggested that a runaway greenhouse effect is plausible.67 This is
further supported by recent modelling of potential cloud feedbacks
leading to a moist greenhouse.68 However, these studies are based on
high-level models with many assumptions.

The current scientific consensus is that any hellish mechanism--- which
could lead to a furnace Earth, complete with evaporated oceans--- is
highly unlikely. In 2009, the IPCC reported, in its 31st meeting, that a
"runaway greenhouse effect" analogous to Venus appears to have virtually
no chance of being induced by anthropogenic activities.69 Whether this
view continues to hold, given the new modelling outcomes, is unclear.
For now, while extinguishing the entire web of life seems far less
likely than causing [human **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is
an outcome that [[**cannot** be]{.mark} entirely **[ruled
out]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

If humans were to go extinct, it is likely that global ecological
collapse would be one of a series of drivers. [Imagine]{.underline} a
world where, in 2075, [we have reached **[4°]{.mark}**C of
[warming]{.mark}. The **climate** system was more **sensitive** than
**expected**]{.underline}, and new energy-hungry machine learning
algorithms led to higher-than-expected energy demand. [After [a]{.mark}

as the Earth warms by 4.5°C in the space of decades. Sources of

[**affected** by]{.mark}]{.underline} transgressing other planetary

depleted and the leftovers are too costly to use at scale. After a long
fight, the final sapien takes her last breath. She is a Māori woman,

[Monitoring of **marine subsidence** often relies on

[accelerometers and inclinometers]{.underline}. A [device utilizing MEMS

[The]{.underline} International Seabed Authority
(**[[ISA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [is the primary regulatory
**body**]{.underline} [dealing with the development of]{.underline}
**[regulations]{.underline}**, [mining **rules** and standard
**[procedures]{.mark}**]{.underline} governing seabed mineral resources.

It has issued contracts that allow the parties to explore an area of
deep-sea bed in excess of 1.2 million km2. The present situation of
deep-sea mining regulatory policies by the ISA has been analyzed
thoroughly in the latest article published in Marine Policy.

[The **ISA** has been working constantly on the **Mining Code**, a
regulatory **framework** to [standardize]{.mark} and oversee **deep-sea
[mining]{.mark}** activities]{.underline}. It is a comprehensive set of
guidelines, principles and protocols that must be followed by any party
involved in deep-sea mining.

After the development of the Mining Code, [**ISA** started developing a
specific set of **principles** for exploitation practices.]{.underline}
Until 2023, [the **ISA** has taken various **crucial steps** in the
**progression** of these exploitation regulations.]{.underline} A major
one is the development of Deep-Data, an internet-based repository for
deep-mining data.

The study of deep-sea mining has a rich history. However, [significant

**[industrial]{.mark} [exploitation]{.mark}**, primarily stemming
[from]{.mark} the [**lack** of]{.mark} comprehensive environmental

The idea of [[**stewardship** is]{.underline}]{.mark}, implicitly,
[[**enshrined** in]{.underline}]{.mark} the 1982
**[[UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Part XII of [UNCLOS sets
out]{.underline} the general [obligation for States to protect and
preserve the marine environment]{.underline} (article 192), and includes
a number of provisions, which elaborate on this obligation. Many recent
publications on governance of marine areas beyond national jurisdiction
have also advocated for improved stewardship of ecosystems \[9\], of
fisheries \[9,180\], of deep-sea mining \[218,224\] and as part of the
new international treaty for marine biodiversity beyond national
jurisdiction \[52\]. A study of long-standing traditional management
systems may provide us with a deeper understanding of how [stewardship
might be practiced in]{.underline} the **[global ocean
commons]{.underline}** in order **[to foster]{.underline}** long-term
**[sustainability.]{.underline}**

UNCLOS is currently implemented through a sectoral regime, where
fishing, shipping, mining and other ocean uses are governed by different
bodies and organizations, or in the case of some new uses (e.g. climate
change mitigation techniques and floating energy or aquaculture
installations), no organization at all \[17,85,174\]. This has created
fragmentation and an inability to respond to cumulative impacts of
multiple threats using an integrated ecosystem approach \[17,174\].
While ecosystem approaches are meant to be central to the activities of
many international and regional ocean conventions, policies and bodies,
they have often proven to be difficult to undertake due to many
political and ecological complexities \[66,83,113,127,183\].

A type of ecosystem approach already exists in traditional management
systems, implemented through a diverse array of area-based management
tools that can be quickly deployed in response to changing environmental
conditions \[89,112,177,184,219\], and are based on an understanding of
humans as part of ecosystems rather than separate from them
\[19,184,219,228\]. **[[Indigenous caring for]{.mark}]{.underline}**
their [**[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} is not equivalent to the
western concept of an ecosystem approach, but is based on specific
worldviews, values, practices and information \[133,231\], which **[can
[provide]{.mark}]{.underline}** new **[[insights for
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[208\]. Indigenous worldviews
generally place humans in the context of an interconnected web of life,
rather than in a position of dominance over other life, and this
understanding may be one of the key components of a holistic,
ecosystem-based approach \[19,184,199,219\]. Similarly, new research on
the need to integrate equity and social justice into an ecosystem
approach \[170\], and experiences in developing stronger co-management
approaches drawing from [multiple knowledge systems]{.underline} and
worldviews can [offer global]{.underline}ly-transferable [insights for
collaborative]{.underline} and integrated marine
[management]{.underline} \[123,133,135,210\]. For ABNJ, new experimental
science-based management approaches such as dynamic ocean management
\[55,91,136\] share common characteristics with the quickly adaptive
nature of traditional management systems \[184,219\]. Traditional
management systems may thus provide lessons on how ecosystem approaches,
adaptive management and area-based tools can be applied to govern a
common resource \[112,132,184,208\].

An example of an [application of cultural principles and
norms]{.underline} can be found [in]{.underline} the [governance
of]{.underline} the [Pacific Ocean,]{.underline} where contemporary
policies have been built on traditional knowledge and a strong cultural
connection of Pacific peoples to the ocean. The fourteen independent
Pacific Island countries and eight dependent island territories, which
are predominantly populated by Indigenous Peoples, adopted the Pacific
Islands Regional Ocean Policy (2002), and subsequently reinforced the
policy through the Framework for a Pacific Oceanscape (2010). These
policies made clear the region\'s interest in managing areas beyond
national jurisdiction, both the seabed and the water column. The
Framework for Pacific Oceanscape draws heavily on Indigenous concepts of
relationships with the ocean, described by Epeli Hau\'ofa as "No people
on earth are more suited to be guardians of the world\'s largest ocean
than those for whom it has been home for generations" \[86\]. The
central and forward-thinking role of Indigenous Peoples and local
communities is highlighted in regional coastal fisheries policies (e.g.
the Noumea Strategy and Future of Fisheries Roadmap). In view of the
above it is hardly surprising that [[Pacific Islands leaders
are]{.mark}]{.underline} strongly [[in favour of]{.mark}]{.underline} a
new International [[Agreement under UNCLOS]{.mark} on the]{.underline}
conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of ABNJ
\[166\] [[and]{.mark} have strongly **[advocated for
inclusion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There are also already explicit
closures of purse seine fishing in place in the so-called "high seas
pockets" in the Pacific Ocean (areas of ABNJ surrounded by Pacific
Island countries EEZs) agreed to by Parties to the Nauru Agreement
\[77,172,180\]. These and other Pacific-led processes demonstrate
**[[Indigenous coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration
**[[for]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[management
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** large **[[ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}** areas,
including ABNJ, and **[[offer]{.underline}]{.mark}** examples for
**[[broader Indigenous approaches for ocean
governance]{.mark}]{.underline}** both within and beyond ABNJ.

**UNCLOS is the most direct path towards [decolonization and indigenous
politics]{.underline}.**

The notion of ["decolonization of international law" is a concept that
developed from post-colonial studies, a scholarship emerging
especially]{.underline} in the period after World War II and the
starting decolonization processes [in the **Global South**.]{.underline}
Post-colonial studies examined the character of international law,
labeling it as twofold. First, it enabled European expansionism. Second,
international law accompanied decolonization processes while at the same
time supporting rising global inequalities. Sundhya Pahuja claims that
imperialism is still a reality and that international law helped retain
dependency (Pahuja, 2014, p. 4).

[Several approaches are dealing with the decolonization of international
law. One of these approaches is **TWAIL** or the **[Third World Approach
to I]{.mark}nternational [Law]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Taha, 2019, p.
1)[.]{.underline} TWAIL emerged in 1995 around a group of critical
international legal scholars that have been seeking to depict how
international law is continuously facilitating the exploitation of the
Third World (Gathii, 2011, p. 28). An overall goal of TWAIL is
attributing the notion of illegitimacy to the regime of international
law. Besides, [the attempt to **[create access for participation]{.mark}
for the Third World in international law** is another cornerstone of the
concept.]{.underline} TWAIL further claims that international law,
despite its universality and promise of global order and stability,
cannot be a just, equitable, and legitimate code of global governance
for the Third World (Mutua, 2000, p. 31). As laid down by Mutua, [TWAIL
scholarship strives to facilitate these objectives by being
anti-hierarchical, counter-hegemonic,]{.underline} careful of universal
creeds and truths, [as well as openly collaborating with other critical
projects, such as critical race theory]{.underline} (Mutua, 2000, pp.
36-38)[.]{.underline} Nonetheless, TWAIL is not universally
representative of Third World views and, at times, it is met with
resistance (Fidler, 2003, p. 30). [[At the heart]{.mark} of TWAIL
[lies]{.mark} the **[unity "in opposition to]{.mark} the [unjust global
order]{.mark}"**]{.underline} (Mutua, 2000, p. 36)[.]{.underline}

[The Third Conference on the **[Law of the Sea]{.mark}**]{.underline}
took place between 1973 and 1982. As such, it [fell right into the
period after]{.underline} the **[decolonization]{.underline}** of states
between the 1940s and 1960s [and]{.underline} the [reorientation of the
global order.]{.underline} [**It [marked]{.mark} a significant
[opportunity]{.mark} for developing countries [to influence]{.mark} the
content of [i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark} substantively**,
particularly re-drafting international trade law, and to include
particular treatment for themselves.]{.underline} Developing countries
came forward by proposing bolder concepts and perspectives beneficial
for their side, but not only. [The [input]{.mark} of countries
[from]{.mark} the **[Global South]{.mark}** was **[featured in]{.mark}**
the [UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fidler, 2003, p. 44). **[Therefore, an
important [demand by TWAIL]{.mark} scholars, the possibility of
participating in international law-making, [can be]{.mark} seen as
[fulfilled]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[Global South]{.mark} countries made substantive
[contributions]{.mark}. Among them have been the concepts
[around]{.mark} the "exclusive economic zones"]{.underline}
(**[[EEZ]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [and the high seas]{.underline},
including the subsoil, [as "common heritage]{.underline} of
mankind["]{.underline}5 (CHM). [These concepts have initially been put
[on]{.mark} the [negotiation table]{.mark} by the Maltese ambassador
Arvid Pardo.]{.underline} During the negotiations, it was essential to
create "equal opportunity" scenarios so that both developed and
developing countries could benefit from the regulations (Fidler, 2003,
p. 44f). In that sense, [the new regimes on EEZ is considered an
improvement for developing states, as **they would not have been able to
harvest these resources on a commercial scale in the open
sea**.]{.underline} (Fidler, 2003, p. 45) However, as we shall see later
under chapter IV.c.4, the realities in Africa today are far off this
promising new feature of EEZs.

Fidler argues that [the [Global South\'s]{.mark} contributions aimed at
**[reshaping i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the
New International Economic Order (NIEO). They wanted to transform
economic regulations between states with regards to trade and foreign
direct investment. In a broader sense, they also aimed at creating
provisions attaining substantial global tolerance (Fidler, 2003, p. 46).

Overall, it is crucial to grasp the politico-economic underpinnings and
implications for the law of the sea. Author Ranganathan highlights a
lack in literature and criticizes that although certain works deal with
the ocean and development, they do not reach the stage of contemplation
of the UNCLOS. She further laments the missing readings illuminating the
political economy of the law of the sea. Here the author also points to
the consideration of the contrast of open and closed seas and to note
how other aspects such as pairs like freedom and enclosure, regimes of
sovereignty and community have advanced the economic exploitation of the
seas (Ranganathan, 2020, p. 4).

In this context, it is worth mentioning the position of land-locked
states and the concept of EEZs during the UNCLOS III negotiations. As
opposed to the land-locked states, coastal states welcomed the proposal
of EEZs, especially developing countries. However, it was evident that
land-locked states would lose a lot by introducing this new concept,
especially as two-thirds of them were underdeveloped. During UNCLOS III
negotiations, the Czechoslovakian delegate noted that it is natural for
land-locked countries, considering their exclusion from the exploitation
of the ocean, to oppose the extension of territorial waters beyond
acceptable limits and the idea of EEZ. Nevertheless, [developing coastal
states were vigorously in favor of the concept of EEZ. Another
**unsatisfied** group were **developed states** who **feared a
limitation of their areas of activity worldwide**.]{.underline} For this
reason, the Soviet Union opposed the concept. Considering the loss that
was received by land-locked states, the draft sought to invent "a
compensatory system...within a regional framework". By that, it was
meant that parts of the revenues should be paid into a fund to develop
the land-locked countries of the same continent. [Over
time,]{.underline} the [land-locked states gave up, keeping in mind that
**[constant opposition]{.mark} could unintentionally [lend]{.mark} a
[helping hand to]{.mark} the cause of
[neocol]{.mark}onialism**.]{.underline} Hence, they gradually softened
their position and acknowledged the proposal for a right to participate
in exploiting the resources. They further claimed for this idea to
become part of UNCLOS. However, coastal states were willing to share
living resources, but clearly denied access to non-living resources
(Naghmi, 1980, pp. 37-40). Although there has been a compensation system
in the UNCLOS, Section IV.d.4. on the African EEZ exploitation will show
how this system finally turned out. In addition, section IV.c. will shed
light on the USSR and their activities with fisheries in foreign EEZs.

[Disputes over economic interests were frequent over the course of the
UNCLOS III negotiations. **The [Global South]{.mark} sought to [defend
equality in exploitation and redistribution]{.mark}**, while the Global
North pursued the protection of free-market principles.]{.underline}
Ranganathan points to a familiar and straightforward narrative. [The
North's attitude became legible by referencing **rational economic
interests** and **domestic factors**.]{.underline} On the contrary, [the
**South** was **reduced** to **outdated information**, **naïve
ideology**, and]{.underline} worst, professional incompetence and
**[poor comprehension]{.underline}** (Ranganathan, 2020, p. 11). Section
IV will show how the initial ideas behind EEZ did not lead to their
expected result, as underdeveloped countries were not capable to deal
with the circumstances and take advantage of their EEZs immediately.

### Impact add-ons

#### Pakistani mining ignites [regional instability]{.underline}.

Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, 4-16-2025, \"U.S. Eyes

4-23-2025, brackets original\]

[[Pakistan's **mineral**]{.mark} reserves, which include massive
**copper** and **gold deposits** as well as critical minerals such as
**lithium**, are estimated to stretch across more **than 230,000**
square miles]{.underline}---more than twice the size of the United
Kingdom.

[Islamabad has long trumpeted its **mineral [wealth]{.mark}**, which it
currently estimates at \$8 trillion,]{.underline} but it has also long
struggled to find willing investors. [This [makes]{.mark} the
**[Trump]{.mark}** administration's [interest
**significant**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [the prospects for
**U.S.-Pakistan** minerals cooperation shouldn't be
overstated]{.underline}; serious [[**security risks** make]{.mark} such
[partnership]{.mark} a **[dangerous]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[gamble]{.underline}.

Minerals might appear to be a new sweet spot for a relationship that has
struggled to find anchors for partnership since the U.S. withdrawal from
Afghanistan in 2021. [The Trump **administration's** strong interest in
**critical minerals** is well **known**.]{.underline} [[China's]{.mark}
recent decision to suspend rare-earth [**exports** gives]{.mark} the
United States **[extra incentive]{.mark}** to explore opportunities in
Pakistan.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, Pakistan might see an opportunity to showcase its mineral
riches to a deeply transactional administration. Sharif also says
mineral investments can reduce Pakistan's dependence on international
financing and bolster its long-term economic sustainability.

[Security]{.underline}, however, [will be a **massive
challenge**]{.underline}. Mining firms often accept high risks, given
the volatile terrain in which they operate. But [Pakistan's conditions
are especially **dangerous** for prospective **mining investors**. The
country suffered **521** terrorist attacks last year]{.underline},
according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies---a 70 percent increase
from 2023.

[More than [**95 percent** of]{.mark} the 521 [attacks were in]{.mark}
the provinces of **Balochistan** and **Khyber** Pakhtunkhwa---where,
according to official **mineral mapping**]{.underline}, most of
Pakistan's [known **[mineral deposits]{.mark}** are
located.]{.underline} [This trend has continued in **2025**: Of the **54
terrorist** attacks reported in Pakistan in February, **53** were in
those **two provinces**.]{.underline}

[The separatist]{.underline} Balochistan Liberation Army
(**[[BLA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) is [one of Pakistan's **[most
potent]{.mark}** violent [actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The number of
attacks]{.underline} perpetrated by the BLA and other banned Baloch
insurgent groups [increased by **119 percent** between 2023 and
2024.]{.underline}

Broadly, counterterrorism operations, state crackdowns, and large
infrastructure projects in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in recent
decades have angered local communities. And significantly, [[**anger**
about]{.mark} **[resource exploitation]{.mark}** has long
[fueled]{.mark} **BLA** [attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As a result, [mineral [investors]{.mark} would be [stepping into]{.mark}
a **[powder keg]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Pakistan's army chief
has promised to provide security to mineral investors, but [Pakistan
**hasn't sufficiently** addressed the security concerns of investors
from China]{.underline}---[its **closest ally**]{.underline}---despite
deploying thousands of security forces to protect Chinese infrastructure
projects.

[If]{.underline} [mineral [investors]{.mark} from the **United States**
or elsewhere are looking at **opportunities** in Pakistan, they might
**[push]{.mark}** to bring in their own **[security
forces]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is illegal in Pakistan, but if
Islamabad gave in, [[that]{.mark} would [create]{.mark} even more
**[volatility]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

II\. Overview

[An arc of latent **nuclear [instability]{.mark}** [stretches]{.mark}
around the globe. From **Central Europe** [through **South
Asia**]{.mark} to **Northeast Asia** and]{.underline} into the [seas
surrounding China]{.underline}, the nuclear weapons countries, or their
close allies, are involved in geopolitical, territorial and other
[disputes]{.underline} that [have]{.underline} the [potential to
**combust** and **escalate**. The arc]{.underline} indeed girdles the
world inasmuch as instability lies in the nature of bilateral and
multilateral relationships and [is affected by **global problems** of
proliferation, **terrorism**]{.underline}, nuclear materials
[and]{.underline} weapons control, transparency and [many
others]{.underline}.

[**Crisis [management]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} more [difficult]{.mark} in
today's]{.underline} security [environment than]{.underline} it was in
the bipolar world of [the Cold War. Conflict dynamics are **less
stable**]{.underline}. Under the right conditions, [any of the
hotspots]{.underline} along this arc [could **morph** into a **nuclear
flashpoint**. A **nuclear [crisis]{.mark}** could [escalate through
**inadvertence**]{.mark}]{.underline} or intention
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[spread virally]{.mark}** to other
parts of the world]{.underline}. Many countries possess nuclear forces,
and their postures are coupled, tightly in some cases and loosely in
others. A nuclear confrontation or detonation would raise nuclear
tensions and alert levels around the world. Such [a **multipolar**
nuclear crisis could follow an **unpredictable** course and prove
**difficult to stabilize**]{.underline}.

This report identifies ways to control crisis escalation and reduce the
myriad risks of deliberate or unintentional use of nuclear weapons. It
is both diagnostic in that it examines the risk of nuclear weapons use
in the various nuclear weapons countries, as well as prescriptive in
offering some remedies.

Any balanced assessment of worldwide nuclear risk finds cause both for
encouragement and concern. One piece of good news is that the global
stockpile of nuclear weapons has plunged from a peak of 70,000 in the
1980s to approximately 16,000 today. If nuclear risk and stockpile size
are correlated, then dramatic progress has been achieved. But the
[overall decline masks the **gloomy fact** that]{.underline} some
[[arsenals are **growing**]{.mark} **rapidly** and posing **greater
risks**, as [in **South Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This dichotomous pattern is pervasive. A few examples: Good news:
Russian nuclear weapons and fissile materials are substantially more
secure against theft today than they were when the Soviet Union
collapsed over two decades ago. Bad news: (i) [[the world]{.mark} is
home to **[sponsors]{.mark} of [prolif]{.mark}eration**, nuclear **black
markets**, [and]{.mark} **promoters** of
**[terror]{.mark}ism**]{.underline}, (ii) large [quantities
of]{.underline} nuclear [weapons are **constantly in
transit**]{.underline} around the world -- [and transportation is the
**Achilles heel** of security]{.underline}, and (iii) [the
[risks]{.mark} of **terrorist capture**]{.underline} of weapons and
materials have [[increased in]{.mark} **South
[Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the past two decades. Pretty good
news: the number of nations possessing nuclear weapons has climbed
slowly while a greater number of aspiring proliferators have abandoned
their programs. Bad news: the number of nations that possess or aspire
to possess a peaceful nuclear energy program that could be transformed
into a nuclear weapons program is fast growing, and many of these
potential proliferators are lacking in good governance. Good and bad
news: non-kinetic and conventional weapons (offensive and defensive) and
global surveillance and intelligence have provided a credible
alternative to nuclear weapons for some nations, but they pose threats
to other nations that lead them to increase their reliance on nuclear
weapons.

While these overly simplified illustrations of risk correlations present
a mixed picture, this commission finds an overall pattern: [risks
are]{.underline} generally [trending in the **wrong direction**. The cup
appears]{.underline} to be more than half [empty in today's]{.underline}
security [environment of proliferation, **nuclear [build-ups]{.mark}**
in **Asia**, [spreading **extremism**, burgeoning **cyber
war**]{.mark}**fare**, vulnerable]{.underline} nuclear
[**[c]{.mark}ommand [and c]{.mark}ontrol** networks]{.underline},
vulnerable and [**insecure** nuclear]{.underline} weapons [storage sites
[and **delivery**]{.mark} **platforms**]{.underline} (particularly
silo-based strategic missiles), and de-stabilizing global military
competition featuring rapid innovation in weapons technology and
modalities of warfare. In the current environment, much needs to be done
to reduce nuclear risks. [The [slope from]{.mark} a crisis to **nuclear
[brinksmanship]{.mark}** [to escalation]{.mark}]{.underline} to the use
of nuclear weapons [with cascading **global implications**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} a much [too steep and
[slippery]{.mark}]{.underline} one.

This latent instability is tremendously aggravated by the simple fact
that the amount of time for decision-making at any point along this
spectrum may be far too short. In general, warning and decision
timelines are getting shorter, and consequently the potential for
fateful human error in nuclear control systems is getting larger.

The short fuses on U.S. and Russian strategic forces compound the risks.
One-half of their strategic arsenals are continuously maintained on high
alert. Hundreds of missiles carrying nearly 1,800 warheads are ready to
fly at a moment's notice. These legacy postures of the Cold War are
anachronisms but they have not yet been consigned to the trash heap of
history. They remain fully operational.

These postures -- geared to very rapid reaction -- reflect an entrenched
mindset of "use or lose" with roots in the Cold War and in past
decisions that perpetuated vulnerabilities in strategic forces and their
chain of command. Bureaucratic inertia perpetuated a status quo that
featured vulnerable land-based forces and nuclear command, control, and
communications networks prone to collapse under the weight of attack,
even a small-scale strike. These vulnerabilities have not gone away. In
some respects the situation was better during the Cold War than it is
today. [[Vulnerability to **cyber**]{.mark} **attack**]{.underline}, for
example, [[is a **new**]{.mark} **wild [card]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the deck. [[Having]{.mark} many far-flung [missiles controlled
**electronically**]{.mark} through]{.underline} an [**aging** and
**flawed** command-control]{.underline} network and ready to launch upon
receipt of a short stream of computers signals [[is a
**nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark} (surety) [**[risk]{.mark}** of the
first order. [It seems]{.mark} the **height of [folly]{.mark}** [in an
era of]{.mark} **rapidly mutating** [cyber war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}
capabilities. Tis concern is reason enough to remove nuclear missiles
from launch-ready alert.

#### Dependence makes [Congolese intervention]{.underline} imminent.

[The [DRC's **mineral**]{.mark} **wealth** is both **vast** and
**diverse**]{.underline}. The nation is the world's dominant producer of
cobalt and a significant producer of copper, tantalum, diamonds, and
tin. All, except for diamonds, [**[are]{.underline}** [on
US]{.underline}]{.mark} [government **[critical]{.mark}** minerals
[lists]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[1\] [[**Cobalt** is]{.mark} a [key]{.mark}
input for **batteries**, **jet engines**, and **turbines**]{.underline};
[**tantalum** for **capacitors**, **semiconductors**, and **medical**
implants; tin for **solder**, **chemicals**, and
**energy**]{.underline}. [The DRC may have **significant deposits** of
lithium]{.underline} as well, though there are no active lithium mines
in the country at present. Currently, most of the DRC's cobalt and
copper production is destined for refining and processing in China.

[For [the US]{.mark}, going to the source seemingly makes **strategic**
and **economic sense**]{.underline}, especially [if the goal
is]{.underline} [for the US to **pivot** and [focus]{.mark} on mineral
**processing**]{.underline} [rather than kickstarting **domestic
mining**]{.underline}. From the Congolese perspective, courting US
partnerships would be a good strategy for diversifying its export
destinations and diluting the influence China currently holds over the
DRC's mining sector.

In the 21st century, [the US has [proven]{.mark} much more
**[willing]{.mark}** than China [to **intervene**]{.mark} directly in
other countries]{.underline}, so [the US]{.underline} could [provide
more decisive **military support**]{.underline}. US security assistance
could help the Congolese government stabilize eastern Congo. However,
[the most significant [**cobalt** and]{.mark} **copper** deposits are in
the comparatively **stable** Lualaba and Haut-Katanga
provinces]{.underline}, while [the [**security challenges** are]{.mark}
mostly in **North** and **South Kivu**, some five hundred [**miles**
away]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's a long distance in a country with some
of the world's sparsest road networks where only 2 percent are paved.

Political Context: Complicated and Violent

[[The]{.mark} Democratic Republic of [**Congo** is]{.mark} among the
world's **poorest** and **[least stable]{.mark}**
countries.]{.underline} Most recently, in January 2025, [the Congolese
**rebel** group]{.underline} March 23 Movement (**[M23]{.underline}**),
[backed by neighboring]{.underline} **[Rwanda]{.underline}**, [took
control of Goma, the capital of Nord Kivu province]{.underline} and the
easternmost major city in the DRC. Goma is home to between 800,000 and 2
million residents. Estimates range widely because Goma, like the rest of
[the DRC, has not had an official census since 1984]{.underline}\[2\]
and [is [home to]{.mark} a large and **[fluid refugee]{.mark}** and
internally displaced persons (**IDP**) community]{.underline}.\[3\]

[The **DRC** has been at war since 1993]{.underline}. Then known as
Zaire, it was ruled by Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, [a **[US-backed]{.mark}**
Cold War client who maintained **[power]{.mark}** in part by [stoking
**ethnic tensions**]{.mark} in the **mineral-rich** east.]{.underline}
As US support waned in the 1990s, Mobutu was left ruling 40 million
people in a country the size of Alaska and Texas combined, with an
economy half the size of Wyoming's.

[Eastern **Congo** soon plunged into **ethnic conflict** that escalated
after the **1994** genocide in neighboring Rwanda.\[]{.underline}4\]
[Millions of **Hutu** refugees]{.underline}---including
génocidaires---[fled into the region as the Rwandan Patriotic Front took
power in the **Rwandan** capital Kigali]{.underline}. In 1997, Mobutu
was ousted by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, a Congolese rebel\[5\], with
Rwandan and Ugandan support. His ouster was the culmination of the First
Congo War (1996--97). But [fighting continued]{.underline}. The Second
Congo War (1998--2003) drew in Angola, Chad, Namibia, and Zimbabwe on
Kabila's side, while Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda backed anti-Kabila
forces, leading to the deaths of nearly 6 million people.\[6\]

[Fast forward a decade.]{.underline} [**M23** formed in **2012** from
the remnants of an earlier, Tutsi-dominated Congolese **rebel
group**]{.underline}, the National Congress for the Defence of the
People ([CNDP]{.underline}).\[7\] [Both groups **received**/**receive**
support from the Rwandan government, which has been accused of
**[exploiting]{.mark}** the **[instability]{.mark}** in eastern Congo
and aiding and abetting the **[looting]{.mark}** of its mineral
resources by **armed groups**]{.underline}. The [endemic fighting and
associated **human rights** abuses, including **child** and **forced
labor**, were behind the 3TG]{.underline} (tin, tungsten, tantalum, and
gold) [provisions the US **Dodd-Frank** Act,]{.underline} [which sought
to keep **conflict minerals** from entering US **supply
chains**.]{.underline}

If this situation sounds complex, that's because it is. [The **DRC** has
five official **languages**, over two hundred spoken languages, and as
many as two hundred fifty different **ethnic groups**]{.underline}. The
physical terrain may not be as challenging as Afghanistan's arid
mountains, but [the human terrain is every bit its **equal**, with
**meddling neighbors** and weak **central** government
institutions.]{.underline}

These [challenges are a major reason **[Beijing]{.mark}** has been able
to [build up **influence**]{.mark} over **Congo's mineral**
resources]{.underline}, as [Chinese firms have historically had a
greater **tolerance** for working in challenging, institutionally **weak
contexts**]{.underline}. The Kisanfu mine has emerged as a significant
producer of copper and cobalt under Chinese ownership. [The concession
had previously been owned by US-based **Freeport-McMoRan**, which sold
to the Chinese mining company **CMOC** in 2020]{.underline}.
Freeport-McMoRan sold Kisanfu as part of a broader strategy of divesting
its African operations and to pay down debt---the latter being a much
weaker constraint on China's government-backed firms.

Big Risks

As a strategy for securing minerals, [a **[US-DRC]{.mark}**
minerals-for-security [deal]{.mark} would come with significant
**[risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The most]{.underline} obvious and
[**consequential** would be US forces being drawn into a [**complex**,
**multiparty** **civil war**]{.mark}**,** as happened following the
**invasions** of **Afghanistan** and **Iraq**]{.underline}. Both of
[those conflicts became **quagmires**, with the US ultimately
withdrawing on less than ideal terms after significant US **blood** and
**treasure** had been shed and spent.]{.underline}

Second, assuming the security situation could be improved simply through
a show of force and deterrence, the business environment would be
challenging. US miners, and Western miners more generally, historically
have had good reasons for avoiding markets with significant risk premia
and reputations for systemic corruption: The risk premia increase
operating costs, and bribing foreign officials is illegal. The Trump
administration recently paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act for 180 days, a pause that could be extended and which was
deemed necessary for US firms to compete in certain markets. But the
former challenge still stands, especially at a time when critical
mineral margins are razor-thin because of Chinese overcapacity and
pricing power, as well as the softening demand outlook as the future of
US green energy transition is in doubt.

Finally, the DRC is richest in a mineral---cobalt---for which the US
demand outlook is shaky. If the Inflation Reduction Act were to be
repealed, future US demand for cobalt would probably be lower than
previously forecast. And even if it weren't, changes in renewable energy
storage and battery technology may render cobalt not as important in the
future as it has been in the recent past. Cobalt-based batteries are
rapidly losing market share to cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP)
batteries whose constituent materials are easier to source.

[**[Diversifying]{.mark}** US critical [mineral s]{.mark}upply chains
[is **essential**]{.mark} for both **economic** and **national**
security]{.underline}. [Equally important is supporting **Africa's**
efforts to harness its **mineral wealth** for sustainable **growth** and
to create **opportunities** that reduce the incentives for **armed
rebellion**]{.underline}. But [[committing US security]{.mark}
resources, including **[personnel]{.mark}**, [to]{.mark} one of [the
**least stable** place]{.mark}]{.underline}s [on Earth would be a
[highly risky]{.mark} means of achieving them.]{.underline} [The US
would be better off pursuing **other options**]{.underline}.

An even [greater **[conflagration]{.mark}** in the Great Lakes region
could **[ignite]{.mark}** given the proper fuse]{.underline}. Several
[factors could lead to **escalation**]{.underline}. Should [border
**skirmishes** continue between **DRC** and **Rwanda**]{.underline}, [a
formal declaration of **war** could follow]{.underline}. This could also
occur if [**heavy weapons**, **equipment**, or **high-ranking**,
uniformed **officers** were seen crossing into DRC from one of
its neighbors]{.underline}. Further, [Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundi
forces could be caught up in **[firefights]{.mark}** within
DRC]{.underline}, [leading to further political tensions]{.underline}
should soldiers from any of these states be killed. After a DRC soldier
crossed into Rwanda and was killed after firing at Rwandans,
[**tensions** ratcheted up in **June** of this year.]{.underline} Such
[events are sparkplug moments for greater **military
action**.]{.underline}

[**Rwanda** and **Uganda** have a long history of **proxy warfare**
against each]{.underline} other, including supporting disparate elements
of M23 today. [Interstate **conflict** is never completely off the
**table**]{.underline}, as [both countries see competition in eastern
DRC as a **zero-sum** game with a single winner]{.underline}. [Should
such a conflict occur, the consequences could threaten governments and
populations]{.underline} across the Great Lakes region, likely
[[contributing to]{.mark} further **[insecurity]{.mark}**, **refugee
movements**, [and]{.mark} the **multiplication** and growth of non-state
**[military groups]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Kenya, a regional leader based on economic size, population, and
political footprint has thrown its hat into the ring as well, albeit as
a peacemaker. With DRC's recent accession to the East African Community,
which includes Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, and
Tanzania, Kenya now has a political stake in the outcome of such
conflicts and an interest in limiting greater warfare among East African
Community members. The Kenyan government has already begun hosting talks
between the parties involved, yet it has demurred to include M23, a key
actor and potential spoiler, harming the efficacy of such diplomacy.
Furthermore, the East African Community has agreed to deploy a
Kenyan-led peacekeeping force to eastern DRC, although only Burundian
forces have yet deployed. Initial results are less than promising, as
Burundian troops appear to be mainly bolstering their country's
interests in the region.

Ongoing election issues and eventual results in Kenya may limit the
country's long-term involvement, as expected victor William Ruto or
opposition leader Raila Odinga may develop foreign policy differences
relative to former president Uhurra Kenyatta.

Extra-Regional Actors

Other international actors have their own interests to consider at
several levels of this conflict. Western states, particularly France,
Belgium, and [the **United States**]{.underline}, [need to consider
DRC's significant **refugee** problems.]{.underline} DRC hosts 5.4
million internally displaced people due to conflict, [a truly
**stunning** number despite the country's size]{.underline}. [The DRC is
also home to **cobalt mines**]{.underline}, [which is a key metal used
in evolving **green technology**. **[Cobalt]{.mark}** is a key component
in durable electric car **batteries**]{.underline}, [and DRC's massive
reserves [have drawn]{.mark} economic [**competition** from
**US**]{.mark} [and **Chinese**]{.mark} companies seeking [to break
into]{.mark} a **new**, **lucrative** [market]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These humanitarian and economic concerns should fuel efforts to resolve
the conflict to create a durable and lasting peace.

[The **United States** and its **allies** should also pay attention to
the activities of [**China**, **Russia**,]{.mark} and [**extremist**
groups]{.mark} in the DRC]{.underline} and the Great Lakes region.
[Chinese companies [have]{.mark} a [significant]{.mark} **economic**
[role]{.mark} to play [in]{.mark} DRC, including [**copper** and
**cobalt**]{.mark} **concessions** that are worth **billions**
of dollars]{.underline}. In the event of a broader regional conflict,
[Chinese companies or the **[Chinese]{.mark} state** may choose to [call
in]{.mark} **private [military]{.mark}** contractors [to protect]{.mark}
their **[interests]{.mark}**, as has already occurred in neighboring
**Ethiopia**, **Eritrea**, **South Sudan**, and **Zambia**]{.underline}.
This represents a potential spoiler for any peace process and another
power broker in the region.

[Russian **proxies** may also attempt to embed themselves in
**DRC**]{.underline}. As seen in CAR and Mali, Wagner Group and other
Russian private military contractors prefer to trade mineral concessions
for security work, often [accelerating the direct **military**
relationship between the **[Russian state]{.mark}** and the
host country]{.underline}. Such [a scenario could unfold in DRC as
well]{.underline}, either in support of DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, or Burundi
in the context of each state's operations against non-state actors.
Indeed, Victor Tokmakov, who worked to build relations between the
Russian state, [**Wagner Group**, and **CAR**, now [holds]{.mark} a high
rank in Russia's embassy in Kinshasa and has offered Russian
**[military]{.mark}** equipment to bolster
DRC's **military**]{.underline}. This [development could aggravate
**conflict** in the country and create a security **relationship**
against Western interests]{.underline}.

[An expanded [conflict]{.mark} in the **Great** **Lakes** could
[provide]{.mark} an opportunity [for **terrorist**]{.mark}
groups]{.underline}---specifically, the Islamic State---[[to
recruit]{.mark} new **members**, conduct **operations**, [and plan
for]{.mark} **activities** around the continent.]{.underline} Although
certain Islamist groups in eastern DRC, including the Allied Democratic
Forces, have already pledged themselves in support of the Islamic State,
actual connections between these parties are weak at present. [Should
conflict expand, this could certainly change, particularly given the
proximity to [**Islamic State** affiliates]{.mark} in the Cabo Delgado
region of Mozambique]{.underline}.

Conclusion

Although elites in DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi reap the economic
gains of emergency-style rule in eastern DRC, [the status quo in the
Great Lakes region could change at a **moment's notice**]{.underline}.
[Simple missteps such as accidental [**firefights** could
trigger]{.mark} [**massive escalation**]{.mark} on the part of any of
these **four players**]{.underline}. The recent flare-up between DRC and
Rwanda provides a stark reminder that the nature of warfare can change
instantly.

#### Moral and tech evolution will [inevitably]{.underline} stop animal exploitation and prevent [wild animal]{.underline} suffering\-\--that's a [far bigger]{.underline} impact

Tobias **Leenaert 16**, Cofounder of Ethical Vegetarian Alternative,
Longtime Speaker, Trainer, Strategist, Author of How to Create a Vegan
World: A Pragmatic Approach, "Would You Press The Button To Make
Humanity Go Extinct?", The Vegan Strategist, 10/26/2016,
http://veganstrategist.org/2016/10/26/would-you-press-the-button-to-make-humanity-go-extinct/

[I often hear people entertaining the thought of making humanity
disappear from the universe because, as a species, we are causing a lot
of suffering, to]{.underline} ourselves and [other sentient beings and
the planet]{.underline}. One thought experiment goes like this: if you
could make humanity painlessly disappear with the pressing of a button,
would you press it? Or, slightly reframing the experiment so that you
can make an abstraction of your own responsibility: would you stop
someone else from pressing the button?

In the animal rights/vegan movement, more [[people]{.mark} seem to be in
[favor]{.mark} of human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} than among the
general population (just my anecdotal experience). That's not hard to
understand. People become animal rights activists and/or vegans because
[they have learned about the horrible suffering humans inflict on
animals]{.underline}, for food, clothing, research or entertainment. [It
is tempting to think that the planet would be a better place without
Homo sapiens]{.underline}, and given that in our thought experiment, no
humans would really suffer (it's just a matter of an instant, and no
humans are left to deplore the new situation), we might say: where's the
harm?

Now, from the viewpoint of the notoriously tricky field of population
ethics, there's a lot of stuff to say here. Apart from the consequences
for other species and the environment, we could talk about whether the
universe in general is a worse or a better place with humans gone. If
there is, on average, more value than disvalue in humans' lives, it
might seem that the net result is negative. But if there's more misery
than happiness, this could be good. We could also think about the value
of future people being born. They will obviously not be born if we let
humanity go extinct. I won't go into this minefield here, because I do
not have strong opinions about these issues, because I can't seem to
wrap my head around them, and mainly because here I want to touch on
some other factors.

[These are the reasons why [I would **not**]{.mark} press the
button.]{.underline}

[1. Humans may do a lot of damage, but they're also
wonderful.]{.underline}

[We all know the horrors]{.underline} that we cause in the world: [to
other people and]{.underline} annually to [65 billion farmed
animals]{.underline} (excluding fish). [We screw up our
environment]{.underline} and use a lot of finite natural resources.
There's no need to write a long and depressing list here. [However, we
can also focus on all the good that we do. Never in the history of our
planet]{.underline} -- or, as far as we know, the universe -- [has there
been a species that invests so much time in making things better for
others. Look at the millions of people active in the non-profit sector.
Look at those trying to help the weakest and the poorest]{.underline}.
Look at all the beautiful things we do. [Seeing Homo sapiens in this
light, it becomes really problematic and unfair to just call us a
shipwreck of a species that only does damage]{.underline}.

[2. [Humans]{.mark} still [have]{.mark} a **lot of [potential to
improve]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In many ways [our [history is **just beginning**]{.mark}. Moments ago we
were mere apes in trees. We developed culture, learning and education
only recently]{.underline}. We -- in the richer countries at least --
only recently managed to create comfortable environments where we no
longer need to worry about food and shelter, so that we can spend more
time on other things. [**[Violence is declining]{.mark}** and this era
is, counterintuitively to some, the **most peaceful era** in
history]{.underline} (read Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our
Nature). [[We're]{.mark} still **[expanding the circle of]{.mark} our
[moral concern]{.mark}**. We'll]{.underline} probably [have to work less
in the future and will devote even more time to creating change for
ourselves and others. And there is the promise]{.underline} (at least
for techno-optimists) [of **[future tech]{.mark}nological
[advancements]{.mark}** that [can]{.mark} help us [have a
**huge**]{.mark} **positive [impact]{.mark}** on ourselves and our
planet]{.underline}.

[3. Humans might be able to **help other species** further down the
road.]{.underline}

In the future, [[given]{.mark} more moral growth and technological
[improvements]{.mark}, rather than having a net negative impact on other
species, [our impact could become **net positive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Arguably [the [**biggest source** of suffering]{.mark} for animals
[is]{.mark} nature/[the **natural condition**. Animals die **by the
billions**]{.mark} because [of hunger, disease]{.mark}, parasitism, the
[climate, predation]{.mark}]{.underline} (see my post The extremely
inconvenient truth of wild animal suffering). Maybe **[in the future,
[we can limit]{.mark}]{.underline}** some of [**[this]{.mark}
suffering**. The [same]{.mark} applies [if]{.mark} at some point in our
more distant future, [we bump into]{.mark} sentient [life on **other
planets**]{.mark}. Chances are there is suffering there, and [if]{.mark}
by that time [we]{.mark} have **[advanced]{.mark} enough morally and
technologically**, [we may]{.mark} be able to
**[help]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course there is the chance that some
other species in our corner of the universe is already at that level,
thus making our own progress less important. But certainly in the event
that we're the only "advanced" ones around (in this region of the
universe), [[it becomes **very important**]{.mark} **that [we
survive]{.mark}** and grow to help. It would be a pity if
everything]{.underline} we have and everything [we are was
lost]{.underline}, and [the universe would need to restart]{.underline}
with another species to reach our level of development. **[Lots of time
and lives lost]{.underline}**.

As you see, I'm thinking a bit ahead. And why not? Some will believe
this is speculation and science fiction that has no relevance for the
problems and suffering at hand. But if we don't destroy ourselves, we
have to assume we're going to be here for a long, long time still. And
in that time, a lot is possible.

We're on our way. We're children still, growing up, getting better. It's
going to take ages or millennia, but we **[[humans might]{.mark} just
turn out to [be the best thing for the universe]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Let's not press that button just yet.

### Extinction O/W\-\--2AC

#### Extinction is the [worst possible impact]{.underline} by eradicating all [current and possible]{.underline} value for both [humans]{.underline} and [animals]{.underline}\-\--it's [profoundly evil]{.underline}, even if they win [all]{.underline} of their arguments.

But claiming that there should not be any more people does not imply
that the population should be zero. As already stated: [[life-extension
**tech**]{.mark}nologies [could enable]{.mark} people to live
indefinitely long lives -- that is, to attain]{.underline} what I call
**[["functional immortality"]{.underline}]{.mark}**, whereby one lives
until she either succumbs to injury, commits suicide, or perishes due to
the heat death of the universe.8 This gestures the "dual policy" at the
heart of no-extinction anti-natalism: first, we should stop procreating
entirely (anti-natalism), and second, [we should develop safe and
effective life-extension technologies]{.underline} (pro-immortalism).
This should appeal to Benatar himself given his anti-Epicurean view that
death is (often) bad and, as such, one ought to (typically) avoid it.
The reason is that, when evaluating an outcome, *any* harm at all "will
be decisive". Since "we (usually) have an interest in continuing to
exist...death may be thought of as a harm, even though coming into
existence is also a harm" (Benatar 2006, 213). This links to an
important distinction between "lives worth starting" and "lives worth
continuing". [Although life is much worse than most of us realise, many
[lives are not *so bad* as to warrant suicide]{.mark}. Thus, they are
**worth continuing** **even though they were not worth starting**, much
like a movie that is **worth finishing** but **not having
started**]{.underline}. (If only you had known the movie was bad, you
would have stayed home rather than venturing out to the theatre.)

[But **just as** there are human lives worth continuing, there are
arguments for why **human existence is worth continuing**, **even if**
it would have been better for our evolutionary lineage never to have
been. The strongest argument against human extinction]{.underline}, if
sound, [comes from **total utilitarianism**]{.underline}. The first to
articulate this idea was Henry Sidgwick \[1874\] 1962, although more
recent versions proceed by calculating how many people could come to
populate Earth or our future light cone, with some claiming that [up to
[10\^46]{.mark} "human [lifetimes" could exist per century]{.mark}
within our galactic supercluster]{.underline} (Ćirković 2002). [Since
[people are the]{.mark} **[substrate]{.mark}** or **"containers"**
[of]{.mark} well-being (or **[value]{.mark}**), the more people [there
are]{.mark} with **[net positive]{.mark}** amounts of
[well-being]{.mark}, the **better things will go** from the "point of
view of the universe"]{.underline}. But creating new lives is
incompatible with anti-natalism, so this line of argumentation is a
non-starter in the present context. There is, however, an alternative
approach that focuses not on the total number of people but on the
quality of their lives -- rather than merely "lives not so bad as to
warrant suicide", [there could exist **[future]{.mark}** life
[conditions]{.mark} that [are **extremely good** and]{.mark} hence
**very much [worth continuing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Why believe that life in the future could **improve**? There are at
least two reasons. First]{.underline}, there is at least some evidence
that [**[violence]{.mark} has [declined]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} the past
several [centuries]{.mark}, if not longer]{.underline} (see Ferguson
2012 for criticisms). Since the middle of the twentieth century, the
[[rights]{.underline}]{.mark} of many groups [has
[expanded]{.mark}]{.underline} in the West, [including women,
minorities, LGBTQ people, and non-human animals -- a process
driven]{.underline} by what Steven Pinker (2011) names [[the **"moral
Flynn effect"**]{.mark}. If this trend continues, we should [expect the
world to become]{.mark} even **more [peaceable and
tolerant]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the future; as Martin Luther King Jr.
(1958) hypothesised, "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it
bends toward justice". [Second]{.underline}, some transhumanists argue
that [[radical]{.mark} **human [enhancements]{.mark}** [could]{.mark}
significantly improve the human condition by **[augment]{.mark}**ing
[core]{.mark} human [capacities]{.mark} like cognition, emotion, wisdom,
and morality]{.underline} (Bostrom 2008; Persson and Savulescu 2012).
Transhumanist philosophers tell us that such [enhancements could [create
a **posthuman condition**]{.mark} that is **[far
superior]{.mark}**]{.underline} in uncontroversial ways than the present
human condition, which is marked by pervasive ignorance, violence,
foolishness, and iniquity. [Together, these]{.underline} two
[[trends]{.mark} could **[greatly decrease]{.mark}** the
"magnitude"]{.underline}, to borrow Benatar's term, [of [harm in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. In doing so, they would yield a future
situation marked by far more well-being than there is today, which is
good from a total (and average) utilitarian perspective.

[**But** one **need not embrace** utilitarianism to **strongly oppose**
human extinction]{.underline}. I have elsewhere explored these arguments
in great detail, so I will here offer only some brief summaries,
directing readers to my prior work. The point is to underline that there
are multiple lines of argumentation that (a) are compatible with
Benatarian anti-natalism, and (b) independently converge on the
conclusion that human extinction, if it were to occur, would constitute
an immense tragedy. A few of these are:

Many more arguments for ensuring our survival could be adduced. In
contrast, there are few compelling reasons for either indifference
toward human extinction or seeing this outcome as desirable. Perhaps the
two most notable are the *argument from negative utilitarianism* and the
*argument from anthropogenic destruction* (which ties into Benatar's
misanthropic case for anti-natalism). The first claims that all that
matters morally is the total amount of suffering in the world,
independent of the total amount of well-being. Thus, if possible, one
should become a "world-exploder" who destroys not just all sentient life
on Earth, but the potential for sentient life to exist in our future
light cone. (One realistic way of doing this might be to weaponise a
particle accelerator. If the universe is in a "false vacuum" state, then
it is theoretically possible to tip it into a "true vacuum" state by
nucleating a "vacuum bubble" that expands in all directions at the speed
of light, obliterating everything it encounters.10) The second claims
that humans have destroyed so much of the biosphere that we deserve to
perish. There are several fringe groups motivated by this view, such as
the Gaia Liberation Front, that advocate for the involuntary
annihilation of humanity; other groups, such as the Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement (VHEMT), argue that humanity should voluntarily
cease procreating for the sake of the "Gaian system". (Thus, VHEMT are
anti-natalists but for reasons unrelated to the harm-benefit asymmetry.)

Considering these for and against arguments together, [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, I believe, [**[overwhelming reason]{.mark}** to
advocate [for]{.mark} the **[continued existence]{.mark}** of
humanity]{.underline}. To quote Derek Parfit (1984, {452--453),

> [civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not
> destroy \[hu\]mankind, these few thousand years may be only a **tiny
> fraction** of the whole of civilized human history. The difference
> between \[nearly all and actually all people dying\] may thus be the
> difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this
> history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has
> occurred so far is **only a fraction of a second**]{.underline}.

### Suffering Not Inevitable---2AC

#### Measuring and alleviating animal suffering is [possible]{.underline} and [preferable]{.underline} to just [letting them die]{.underline}.

animals and are relatively common. They include, among many others,
cases when [people]{.underline} acting [**individually rescue**
animals]{.underline} drowning in ponds or mud ponds, trapped in frozen
lakes, stranded in beaches, and affected by floods, fires and different
types of natural disasters. [Some people build **structures** that
shelter animals]{.underline} from the effects of severe weather and
other threats. At a larger scale, [some]{.underline} private or public
[initiatives help a greater number]{.underline} of animals. [These
include **rescue centers**]{.underline}, [**wild animal hospitals** and
**orphanages**]{.underline}, where sick, injured or orphaned animals who
would otherwise probably die are taken care of. In some cases, feeding
projects conducted during especially harsh winters, or during droughts,
save the lives of many starving animals. Finally, [other projects help
animals much more extensively]{.underline}. [The clearest example may be
wild animal **vaccination programs**]{.underline} (Anderson & Anderson,
Citation2006; Animal Ethics, Citation2020a, ch. 8--10; Bovenkerk et al.,
Citation2003; Delahay et al., Citation2009; Kirkwood & Sainsbury,
Citation1996; Marion et al., Citation2008; Thompson et al.,
Citation2015).

Wild animals could be helped in other, more significant ways if there
were a will to do so. This would require investing the resources needed
to gain more knowledge about the best ways to help. There are clear
examples that show how this could be done. For the sake of both
biological conservation and human interests, [a **very significant
amount** of resources has been invested in researching the ways
ecosystems work]{.underline}. [The interventions implemented to pursue
these two aims have been informed by the knowledge acquired by such
research]{.underline}. Similarly, [research could be done for the sake
of **reducing wild animal suffering**]{.underline}. The progress made
thus far in achieving this aim has been very little, especially in
comparison to anthropocentric and conservationist goals. But this has
not been due to there being something especially inscrutable or
intractable about reducing such suffering, but because no significant
resources have been invested in the field.

Part of the explanation for why wild animal suffering has been neglected
is simply that animals are still largely disregarded in our societies.
Another reason is that it is often taken for granted that animals have
happy lives in the wild and that there is nothing they need help with.
This idyllic view is, however, challenged by the above-mentioned
examples of ways in which animals are rescued from situations of dire
need. Such cases take place in circumstances where animals are gravely
threatened and are often undergoing severe suffering. In fact, the
available evidence indicates that such cases are not uncommon, given the
[many factors]{.underline} negatively affecting wild animals' wellbeing
(Animal Ethics, Citation2020a; Duclos, Citation2022; Faria,
Citation2023; Horta, Citation2017; Horta, Citation2017/2022; Johannsen,
Citation2020; Ng, Citation1995; Tomasik, Citation2010/2015). Such
factors can pose formidable challenges that [cause wild animals to **die
in painful ways**]{.underline}, often shortly after coming into
existence and [without having had the chance to **enjoy significant
pleasurable experiences**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, together
with the large numbers of wild animals that there are (Ray,
Citation2017; Tomasik, Citation2009/2019), [means that efforts aiming at
helping them are **much more important** than they might
seem]{.underline} at first glance.

In light of its scale, there has been a growing amount of literature in
recent years claiming that wild animal suffering should receive much
more attention than it currently does. In addition to expressing support
for existing ways of helping wild animals, the most common claim made by
those who have worked on this problem is that more research should be
dedicated to it (see for instance Animal Ethics, Citation2020a; Faria &
Horta, Citation2019; Ng, Citation1995; Soryl et al., Citation2021). But
these [claims]{.underline} have met with objections. Some of them are
what we can call impracticability or intractability objections. They
appeal mostly to epistemic limitations in order to argue [that wild
animal suffering is an **intractable** cause area]{.underline}. Other
objections, instead, are normative ones, as they are based on the idea
that helping wild animals is not desirable. This paper will use the
information available about wild animal suffering to argue that such
objections **[fail]{.underline}**, especially [considering the ways of
helping animals that are **currently** being implemented]{.underline},
[and the ways that may be implemented in the **near
future**]{.underline}.

This paper will first present several ways of helping wild animals that
are especially promising at this point because of their potential to
foster future work on the topic. In doing this, it will consider the
results of a recent survey on this topic among natural science scholars
and students done by the animal organization Animal Ethics
(Citation2020b). The paper will then explain the kind of novel,
cross-disciplinary scientific work that would be necessary in order to
increase our understanding of the factors negatively affecting wild
animals, and of the ways to reduce their suffering. It will then
consider [the objection that there is **nothing that can be done** to
effectively reduce wild animal suffering]{.underline}. The paper will
argue that the available ways of helping wild animals suggest this
objection **[does not present a serious challenge]{.underline}**. Next,
it will argue that the ways of helping wild animals highlighted in the
survey by Animal Ethics can avoid some of the main normative objections
against preventing wild animal suffering. Finally, the paper concludes
by indicating some current perspectives on the development of this field
of work.

Promising Ways of Helping Wild Animals

A survey published in 2020 by the animal advocacy organization Animal
Ethics (Citation2020b) identified three [areas]{.underline} of research
[considered]{.underline} to be [especially promising]{.underline} by
biology, environmental studies and veterinary science scholars and
students: [helping animals affected by **weather events**]{.underline},
[wild animal **vaccination** and helping wild animals in **urban
environments**]{.underline}. Over 80% of respondents among both scholars
and students agreed that research on those topics would provide useful
knowledge (research on helping animals in urban areas was considered
especially promising, with more than 90% of respondents expressing
support for it).Footnote1 In addition, the majority of scholars (in some
cases, again over 80%) also agreed that such research would receive
support from fellow scholars and from their university, and the majority
of students agreed that they would be supported by their professors and
by their fellow students. It thus looks like these three topics may be
promising topics to start working on. We will see now what work in each
of them consists of.

Rescuing Animals Affected by Extreme Weather Events

Weather events regularly affect animals negatively, sometimes in very
serious ways. For instance, many animals drown in floods or due to lake
thaws, or are removed from the areas where they live by floods or by
heavy winds. Many animals that survive these events get orphaned and
cannot fend by themselves. Extreme weather can also cause other events
that can severely harm very large numbers of animals, such as forest
fires.

Concerned individuals sometimes aid animals in these situations. But, at
a larger scale, protocols aiming at preventing the harms that animals
can suffer during and after these events, or at introducing and
improving the efficiency of rescue programs carried out during these
event, can be designed and implemented (Gutiérrez & de Miguel,
Citation2021; McCumber & King, Citation2020; Sássi et al., Citation2021;
Sawyer & Huertas, Citation2018).

Vaccination

We already mentioned the importance of [wild animal vaccination
programs]{.underline}. These [have been carried out for **several
decades** already in different parts of the world]{.underline},
targeting diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, tuberculosis and,
especially, rabies, among others (Gormley et al., Citation2017;
Rupprecht et al., Citation2004; Turnbull et al., Citation2004). A common
method for delivering the vaccine is the use of oral baits that the
targeted animals are attracted to. To cover wide areas, these baits can
be air-dropped. In other cases, other delivery methods are used: for
instance, bats have been vaccinated using sprays that reach them in
large numbers (Fontaine, Citation2017).

While vaccination programs are implemented with the aim of preventing
diseases from being passed to either animals used by humans or to humans
themselves, [these programs have]{.underline} nonetheless [been **very
beneficial** for the **very large numbers** of nonhuman animals who have
been immunized]{.underline}. **[Rabies]{.underline}**, for instance,
[has been **eradicated** from large parts of different
countries]{.underline}. The success of wild animal vaccination programs,
coupled with the importance that they may have to human health, means
[there is currently **a lot of interest** in continuing to invest in
them]{.underline}. Furthermore, [interest in these programs is likely to
**increase further**]{.underline} due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
prevention of future outbreaks caused not just by new coronaviruses
different from SARS-CoV-2, but also by other pathogens, is likely to
receive more attention (Edwards et al., Citation2021; Monath,
Citation2013). In this way, [human interest in avoiding future zoonotic
diseases will]{.underline} as a side effect continue to [**reduce
suffering** and **deaths** among wild animals]{.underline}.

Reducing Suffering Among Synanthropic Animals

When people first think of wild animals, they tend to think of animals
living in the wilderness. However, many wild animals live close to
humans, in environments that have been transformed very significantly by
humans. These include urban, suburban, industrial and agricultural
areas. Animals living there are often called synanthropic, which means
that they live close to humans. Synanthropic animals include, among
others, many types of birds, small mammals and reptiles, amphibians, and
arthropods. In some areas, they can include larger animals like foxes,
storks, iguanas, etc. (Adams, Citation2016; Burger & Lunney,
Citation2004; Hadidian & Smith, Citation2001; Michelfelder,
Citation2018).

These animals face different opportunities and challenges. They not only
face a number of anthropogenic threats, but also suffer due to natural
factors. Due to the latter, a good starting point for measures that aim
to reduce wild animal suffering could be to implement programs that aim
to improve the lives of synanthropic animals. Programs would be easier
to implement, monitor, and assess in the areas where synanthropic
animals live than in more remote places. Such programs could also
include assistance programs for animals affected by extreme weather, and
vaccination programs. [Protocols for **extreme weather
events**]{.underline} ([and other **natural disasters**]{.underline})
affecting urban and rural areas [are increasingly taking]{.underline}
domesticated [animals into consideration]{.underline}. They could take
wild animals into consideration as well. As for wild animal vaccination,
it seems that vaccination plans for synanthropic animals are easy to
defend for anthropocentric reasons alone, and are a good way to start
increasing concern for these animals.

Other Promising Areas of Work

In addition to the ways of helping animals identified in the survey
mentioned above, there are others that seem to be promising for at least
three reasons: they appear to be relatively noncontroversial, their
development can take advantage of research that has already been done,
and they may have great potential in the long run for helping a large
number of animals. We will consider two of them here.

Contraception

Wild animal immunocontraception methods have been developed in recent
decades, targeting especially mammals and birds (Ansari et al.,
Citation2017; Asa et al., Citation2012; Cooman et al., Citation2011;
Patton et al., Citation2007). While in some cases the administration of
contraceptives requires interacting with the animals (as in the case of
injectable GonaCon immunocontraceptive vaccines for ungulates), in
others this is not necessary, since the contraceptives can be delivered
using oral baits (Cohn & Kirkpatrick, Citation2015; Fagerstone et al.,
Citation2010).

Contraception can save many animals from suffering and dying from both
anthropogenic and natural causes. It sometimes happens that certain
animal populations grow larger than humans want them to be, and as a
result, members of those populations are hunted down. We can of course
question the reasons for why this is done. However, we may not be able
to convince the relevant decision-makers that their reasons are poor. In
those cases, we can defend contraception as an alternative approach that
would save the lives of animals who would otherwise be killed. But this
is not the only way contraception can help animals. It can also help to
prevent animal populations from growing to the point where their members
die because they do not have enough food or other resources in their
environments. Moreover, contraception can be what eventually makes it
possible for other measures helping animals to succeed. In fact, this
may be where its most significant potential lies in the long-term. To
see why, consider an example. Suppose that there is a certain population
of animals whose members are suffering due to a certain factor limiting
its growth, such as, say, a disease. Suppose, further, that we have the
opportunity to eradicate this disease through some treatment. However,
if we do so, there is a risk that the population will grow substantially
and that, in the end, we will merely be postponing its members'
suffering. A solution may consist in combining the treatment for the
disease with a contraception program. This may allow us to improve the
present situation of this population, while preventing population growth
and the problems it would cause. Contraception may be even more
important in cases where animals are provided supplemental feeding,
since feeding programs have an even greater risk of increasing the
populations they target.

Measures Reducing Aggregate Suffering at the Ecosystem Level

There are other types of measures that can have an impact not just in
certain individuals or populations, but at the ecosystem level.
Consider, for instance, decisions concerning whether a previously
existing ecosystem should be restored or not, or about what kind of
trees or bushes should be planted if a reforestation plan is going to be
implemented. In such cases, [we may be able to **make**]{.underline}
some rough [**predictions** about the different ecosystems that
different decisions would produce]{.underline} in the targeted area.
Accordingly, we may be able to guess what kind of animals will be there
in each case. Such animals might be among those who have higher survival
rates and longer average lifespans, and who reproduce by having small
numbers of offspring. Or they may, instead, be among those who reproduce
in very large numbers and tend to die in their very early youth. The
latter, who unfortunately are the majority in nature, typically have
much harder lives. Their lives may be so hard that they often contain
more suffering than pleasure (Faria & Paez, Citation2015; Horta,
Citation2017; Ng, Citation1995).

In this way, [it's **possible** to]{.underline} roughly [**compare** the
expected wellbeing of the animals who would exist]{.underline} in
different possible ecosystems. Accordingly, [we may reach the conclusion
that in one of them animals will **generally be in a better
situation**]{.underline}. If that is so then [we would have reasons to
**favor** the **presence** of that ecosystem]{.underline}, [instead of
alternative ones where animals do **worse**]{.underline}. In particular,
we would have reason to favor the ecosystems containing animals that
tend to have longer lifespans, rather than those containing animals who
typically die shortly after coming into existence. The expected
wellbeing of animals could be considered in our decisions concerning
whether a reforestation program should take place in one way or in
another way. It could also be used to decide if a certain area should be
reforested at all. If the ecosystem existing at present in that area has
a lower level of wellbeing for animals than the one that would result
from reforestation, then we should favor reforestation, although if it
were the other way around, we would have reason to oppose reforestation.
(These comparisons can be done regardless of the particular
philosophical conception of wellbeing we hold).

A Cross-Disciplinary Applied Approach

The kind of approach needed in order to successfully research ways of
helping animals like the ones listed above is one that combines the
methods and viewpoints of different disciplines. To be more specific,
successfully researching how to help wild animals would require two
things: (i) expanding animal welfare assessments to wild animals living
outside direct human control (JWD Wildlife Welfare Supplement Editorial
Board, Citation2016; Kirkwood & Sainsbury, Citation1996); and (ii)
looking at the knowledge that can be gathered in different fields in the
science of ecology, and related disciplines, through the eyes of the
science of animal welfare (Faria & Horta, Citation2019; Soryl et al.,
Citation2021). While novel, this cross-disciplinary approach --
sometimes referred to as 'welfare biology' (Ng, Citation1995) -- would
nevertheless be grounded on the knowledge previously gathered in those
fields.

[Methods of welfare assessment have **developed
significantly**]{.underline} during the last decades, although for the
most part [they]{.underline} have been applied to domesticated animals
of the most populated species (mainly those that are kept and killed for
the production of food products, such as pigs, cows and chickens, among
others). Similar assessments of other animals have been done only to a
very limited extent. But progress in this field can be made with respect
to animals in the wild as well. This would [provide]{.underline} us with
[**very useful insights** into how wild animals are
feeling]{.underline}. In addition to developing these assessments it
would be necessary to gather more knowledge about the different external
factors affecting wild animals' wellbeing. This would be a job for the
science of ecology. Due to a disregard for animals as individuals with a
wellbeing of their own, previous work in ecology has not focused on the
experiences animals have, but on other matters, such as the
circumstances in which animals find themselves, how they try to deal
with them, and the manner in which some animals are eventually able to
transmit their genetic information to further generations. But such work
can nevertheless be enormously useful for making informed evaluations of
how animals in the wild are harmed in different ways. This is because
[such work has included]{.underline}, to a large extent, an [examination
of the factors affecting animal populations]{.underline}, [such as
weather variations]{.underline}, [food and water
availability]{.underline}, [antagonism with other animals]{.underline},
[disease]{.underline}, [etc]{.underline}. [The impact of these factors
has been **measured extensively** in many different populations all
around the world]{.underline}. Such [measurements]{.underline} have been
made in terms [of things such as mortality]{.underline}, [reproductive
success]{.underline}, [health indicators]{.underline}, [and other
dimensions]{.underline} different from wellbeing. However, they [provide
**significant information** about the wellbeing of animals]{.underline}.
The reason is that when animal populations are affected by a certain
factor in ways that increase mortality and reduce the average health of
animals, it is reasonable to infer that the wellbeing of those animals
is also being negatively affected (Faria & Horta, Citation2019; Hecht,
Citation2021). For instance, we know a great deal already about the
impact of variations in temperature on animal populations (Bowler et
al., Citation2017; Dillon et al., Citation2016). But if a cold wave
kills half of a population, we can conclude that the animals that were
killed were harmed by their death (Bradley, Citation2016; Kaldewaij,
Citation2006). In addition, it makes sense to assume that they suffered
in the process of dying. Moreover, it seems implausible that the only
animals who suffered from the cold wave were the ones who died. Rather,
the cold affected all the animals in the population, so it is likely
that the rest of those animals also had their wellbeing worsened, to
different degrees, by the cold wave. Similar inferences can be made when
we consider other factors.

In addition, the know-how already possessed in the fields of applied
ecology and wildlife management can be used to implement measures
benefiting animals. Work designing actual programs that put into
practice the ways of helping animals listed above can be useful not just
in themselves, but because they can light the path to further
cross-disciplinary work that would develop this novel field.

Responding to Intractability Objections

Having considered the positive case for expanding efforts to help wild
animals, we can now consider objections to such efforts. Perhaps the
most common objection is that, due to the complexity of ecosystems, we
do not know all the possible effects that our actions could have on
them. There could be a serious risk of causing unforeseen catastrophic
outcomes. Therefore, the objection goes, for the sake of animals
themselves, it would be safer to leave things as they are, since in
trying to help animals we may make things worse for them (Delon &
Purves, Citation2018).

There are several responses that can be given to this objection. The
following ones may be the most relevant:

Stressing the Importance of Research

The first point to make here is something we have stressed throughout
this paper, especially in the previous section. We have stressed the
importance of developing the study of the wellbeing of wild animals, the
factors affecting them, and the ways to help them. Gathering this
knowledge may have a much higher impact in the long run than rushing to
act immediately. To be sure, in order to optimize the results of our
actions we should try to minimize risks. But [if we **give up** on
helping wild animals]{.underline}, [we will not just minimize
risk]{.underline}, [but **abandon altogether** the goal of having a
**positive impact**]{.underline}. Instead, fostering further research
can help to attain this goal while significantly reducing risks.

The Example of Standard Practice in Ecology

In addition, the objection is at odds with the way we proceed when human
interests or biological conservation are at stake. When interventions in
ecosystems are implemented for conservationist or anthropocentric
reasons, [scientists do not expect to have complete
knowledge]{.underline} of everything that will happen. [Yet they make
some **reasonable predictions** on the basis of a **great deal** of
accumulated knowledge]{.underline}. Current practice in ecology, while
certainly supportive of the idea that ecosystems are very complex and
difficult to predict, also assumes that the success of programs in
applied ecology is possible so long as they are adequately planned and
monitored. On the basis of this, scientists accept some reasonable risks
for the sake of such goals, in part because inaction is costly. We
should do the same for the sake of animals' interests. Of course,
[conservation biologists typically study]{.underline}, [in **great
detail**]{.underline}, [the problem of **unforeseen
consequences**]{.underline}, [and on the basis of this they decide to
**limit** their activities]{.underline} accordingly, [or to **go
ahead**]{.underline} with them. Welfare biologists should proceed in the
same way.

It could be argued that aiming to reduce the suffering of wild animals
is problematic, while aiming to achieve other goals within ecosystems is
not. But it is not clear that this particular aim is uniquely
problematic. To be sure, [it could be argued that it is **very difficult
to know** exactly what kind of mental states nonhuman animals
have]{.underline}. However, [this objection **does not seem to be
correct**]{.underline}, for two reasons. First, as we have seen above,
[even if we can **never access** animals' mental states]{.underline},
[there are **indicators** we can use]{.underline} -- we have seen
already how death can be used as a proxy for suffering. Second, this
objection points to something important, but different from the matter
at stake here. The problem we are examining is whether efforts that aim
to reduce wild animal suffering should be expected to fail because there
will always be unexpected consequences. The basis for claiming this is
not the difficulty of adequately assessing the well-being of nonhuman
animals. Rather, it is the complexity of ecosystems, which is a factor
that is also relevant to interventions carried out for the sake of human
interests or biological conservation.

### Humans Outweigh---2AC

#### Animal welfare is [marginal]{.underline} and [outweighed]{.underline} by human potential.

**Morgensen, 22**---Global Priorities Institute, University of Oxford
(Andreas, "The weight of suffering," GPI Working Paper No . 4, May 2022,
dml) \[AO=Always Outweighable, RC=Repugnant Conclusion, RRC=Reverse
Repugnant Conclusion\]

Almost all welfare subjects are [non-human animals]{.underline}, very
many of which [live for only a **short time** and]{.underline} plausibly
[have only a **limited capacity** for well-being and **limited
experience** of positive welfare states]{.underline}. Some examples of
especially abundant animals (and their approximate standing populations)
include ants (10,000 trillion (Hölldolber and Wilson 1995)),
bristlemouth fish (100s of trillions (Broad 2015)), and chickens (20
billion (Robinson et al. 2014)). [Even if the lives of these animals are
worth living]{.underline}, [they are **very unlikely** to exceed a level
above which a life is better than **only just** worth
living]{.underline}, assuming that such a level is chosen to satisfy our
intuitions about RC. Thus, as one possible realization of the population
of drab lives quantified over in RC, Parfit (2016: 118) imagines a
population of "animals who \[have\] lives that \[are\] just worth
living, because these animals \[have\] enough slight pleasures like
those of cows munching grass or lizards basking in the sun." Conversely,
[we might think that such lives will be **only just** not worth
living]{.underline}, [if in fact they are beneath the neutral
level]{.underline}.

The view that most sentient animals have lives that are not worth living
is disturbingly plausible. Many wild non-human animals adopt
life-history strategies that emphasize high rates of reproduction and
minimal parental investment, producing offspring in quantities several
orders of magnitude greater than the replacement rate, almost none of
which survive to reproduce. Hapgood (1979: 44-45) writes: "In her
lifetime a lioness might leave 20 cubs; a pigeon 150 chicks; a mouse,
1,000 kits; a trout 20,000 fry, a tuna or a cod, a million fry or more".
The many offspring who do not survive to reproductive maturity may have
very brief lives whose affect balance is dominated by a painful death.
These many, many brief lives might therefore very well not be worth
living. If so, [their sheer abundance **could** be thought to make it
the case that total suffering **exceeds total enjoyment** among wild
non-human animals]{.underline} (Ng 1995; Tomasik 2015; Horta 2017).11
**[Nonetheless]{.underline}**, [because these lives are **so very
short**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} because the juveniles of the
animals that reproduce in the highest numbers are [**sufficiently
cognitively rudimentary** at the point of death that they might be
barely conscious]{.underline} (Browning and Veit 2021), [these
many]{.underline}, [many lives that are not worth living might be **only
barely so**]{.underline}.

Consider, next, domesticated animals. Setting aside fish and farmed
invertebrates, the population of domesticated animals consists in large
part of chickens raised for meat. The standing global population of
chickens is about 20 billion individuals, compared to only 1.5 billion
cattle, 2 billion sheep and goats, and 1 billion hogs (Robinson et al.
2014). In 2007, nearly 9 billion 'broiler' chickens were produced for
slaughter in the US, compared to an annual inventory of 320 million egg
laying hens (Norwood and Lusk 2011). Broilers are typically harvested at
just 4-8 weeks old. At the time of slaughter, birds have on average 0.7
square feet of space. They suffer from leg problems caused by their
oversized breasts, with one study of birds just prior to slaughter
finding that around 28% experience some pain due to leg problems and
3.3% are almost unable to walk (Knowles et al. 2008). Herzog (2010: 156)
describes the conditions in which these broilers are raised as
"Dante-esque: the chicks will never see sun nor sky. Because they are so
top-heavy, broiler chickens spend most of their day lying down, often in
litter contaminated with excrement. As a result, many will develop
breast blisters, hock burns, and sores on their feet." Nonetheless, they
have ample food and water, as well as litter for scratching. Some
authors therefore maintain that broiler chickens in the US on average
have lives worth living. Norwood and Lusk (2001: 131) write that "after
reviewing all the obstacles to welfare and the nature of the birds, in
our assessment, broiler farms do not cause large-scale suffering." I
know many who find this claim very hard to believe, because the lives of
broilers seem awful. However, Norwood and Lusk's conclusions are
generally even-handed and clearly explained, and they do not shy away
from condemning the lives of many farmed animals as worse than death.12
If in fact they are wrong, I would expect that they are not too far
wrong. Thus, while it may seem plausible to us that broiler chickens in
their billions have lives that are not worth living, they might well be
only barely so.

At the start of this paper, I asked whether the good experienced by
human and non- human animals in aggregate suffices to counterbalance all
the harms they suffer, such that the world is morally good on balance,
or whether the moral weight of suffering is greater. In light of the
evidence reviewed above, our answer could turn on AO. Given the sheer
number of lives that might not be worth living that are added to the
population year on year, if AO is true, the weight of suffering could
very easily be greater. If AO is false, the optimist can more easily
stand her ground. [Assuming that]{.underline} we are willing to say that
[animals]{.underline} with lives like those reviewed above [have lives
that are **at worst** only just not worth living]{.underline}, [we
may]{.underline} then go on to [assert that lives of that
kind]{.underline}, **[no matter how abundant]{.underline}**, [**cannot**
together **outweigh** the value inherent in at least the very best human
lives]{.underline}.

7\. Conclusion

In this paper, I have set out an argument for LTNU, which proceeds from
a small handful of intuitive structural principles and two individually
plausible additional premises to the conclusion that there exists some
depth of lifetime suffering that cannot be counterbalanced by any
measure of well-being experienced by others. As I've shown, there are
significant costs to accepting this conclusion. We have little hope of
avoiding these costs by questioning the argument's structural
principles. We do not do much better in giving up CON-RRC, unless we are
willing to accept RRC. By giving up AO, we are able to assert that
[there are some lives **so good** that their addition to the population
can **counterbalance** the addition of any number of lives that are only
barely not worth living]{.underline}. Independently, [this conclusion
could provide a way of **avoiding** the]{.underline} dreary [conclusion
that suffering in aggregate **morally outweighs** happiness among human
and non-human animals]{.underline}, at least for now.

Part of the reason for this confidence is that AI improvements seemed to
exhibit exponential growth over the last few years. This past growth
suggests that transformational capabilities could emerge unexpectedly
and quite suddenly. This is in line with some well-known examples of the
surprising effects of exponential growth. In "The Age of Spiritual
Machines," futurist Ray Kurzweil tells the story of doubling the number
of grains of rice on successive chessboard squares starting with one
grain. At the end of 63 doublings there are over 18 quadrillion grains
of rice on the last square. The hypothetical example of filling Lake
Michigan by doubling (every 18 months) the number of ounces of water
added to the lakebed makes the same point. After 60 years there's almost
nothing, but by 80 years there's 40 feet of water. In five more years,
the lake is filled.

These examples suggest to many that exponential quantitative growth in
AI achievements can create imperceptible change that suddenly blossoms
into transformative qualitative improvement in AI capabilities.

[But these analogies are misleading. **Exponential growth in a finite
system cannot go on forever,** and there is no guarantee that it will
continue in AI development even into the near future.]{.underline} [One
of the key developments from 2024 is the apparent recognition by
industry that training time scaling has hit a wall and that further
increases in data, parameters, and compute time produce diminishing
returns in capability improvements.]{.underline} The industry apparently
hopes that exponential growth in capabilities will emerge from increases
in inference time compute. But so far, [those improvements have been
smaller than earlier gains and limited to science, math, logic, and
coding---areas where reinforcement learning can produce improvements
since the answers are clear and knowable in advance]{.underline}.

Today's large language models (LLMs) show no signs of the exponential
improvements characteristic of 2022 and 2023. [OpenAI's GPT-5 project
ran into performance troubles and had to be downgraded to GPT-4.5,
representing only a "modest" improvement when it was released earlier
this year. It made up answers about 37% of the time,]{.underline} which
is an improvement over the company's faster, less expensive GPT-4o
model, released last year, which hallucinated nearly 60% of the time.
[But OpenAI's latest reasoning systems hallucinate at a higher rate than
the company's previous systems.]{.underline}

[Many in the AI research community think AGI will not emerge from the
currently dominant machine learning approach that relies on predicting
the next word in a sentence. In a report issued in March 2025, the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), a
professional association of AI researchers established in 1979, reported
that 76% of the 475 AI researchers surveyed thought that "scaling up
current AI approaches" would be "unlikely" or "very unlikely" to produce
general intelligence.]{.underline}

These doubts about whether current machine learning paradigms are
sufficient to reach general intelligence rest on widely understood
limitations in current AI models that the report outlines. [These
limitations include difficulties in long-term planning and reasoning,
generalization beyond training data, continual learning, memory and
recall, causal and counterfactual reasoning, and embodiment and
real-world interaction.]{.underline}

#### Misaligned AI is wrong -- AI checks itself

**Salib '24** (Peter N. Salib, Assistant Professor of Law at the
University of Houston. Executive Co-Director of the Center for Law and
AI Risk, Law and Policy Advisor to the Center for AI Safety, Senior
Research Affiliate at the Institute for Law & AI, and a Contributing

Social Contract: A Lawfare Paper Series, May 2024,
<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4445706>); LF

[This paper defends three claims in support of its conclusion that
self-improvement is less likely than generally assumed.]{.underline}
[First, an AI with the ability to self-improve will, in principle, have
reason to fear more capable systems, including if such systems result
from self-improvement.]{.underline} The arguments here are mostly
well-known ones, drawn from the literature on human-AI risk. The paper's
contribution is showing how [these arguments apply not just to humans
contemplating improving AI systems but also to AI systems contemplating
improving themselves.]{.underline}

[Second, the paper defends the claim that AIs that could self-improve
will likely fear more capable systems and will thus seek to avoid
self-improvement.]{.underline} This is not obvious. [It is at least
possible that some AIs with the ability to self-improve could lack other
capabilities necessary to recognize the risks of self-improvement.
Others might solve the alignment problem and self-improve without
risk.]{.underline} To determine what scenarios are likely, the paper
identifies three relevant capabilities for AI systems. It argues that
**[the temporal order in which these capabilities emerge determines
whether a given AI will seek to self-improve]{.underline}**. [The three
capabilities are the ability to self-improve, the ability to apprehend
risk from misaligned AI, and the ability to align improved AI. The paper
provides reasons to think that safer orderings of emergence are much
more likely than more dangerous ones. It also argues that if certain
prima facie dangerous orderings turned out to be likely, this would,
counterintuitively, provide independent reason to reduce estimates of AI
risk.]{.underline}

[Third and finally, the paper argues that if AIs individually wanted to
avoid self-improvement, they could collectively resist it.]{.underline}
This is not obvious, either. Even if every individual AI agent
disfavored selfimprovement, arms race dynamics might produce it anyway.
Such dynamics may be the reason that humans continue to rapidly improve
AI capabilities, despite the risks. [However, recent findings in
algorithmic game theory suggest that AIs can cooperate to overcome such
collective action problems more easily than humans can.]{.underline}

Here then, is the paper's argument: [If (1) certain AIs would, in
principle, fear self-improvement, and if (2) such AIs are more likely to
emerge than ones that would not fear it, and if (3) AIs that fear self
improvement are likely to be able to collectively resist it, then
self-improvement is somewhat unlikely to occur, even conditional on it
becoming possible.]{.underline}9 The paper also includes a concrete
prediction about AI progress. [Namely, once AIs reach rough human-level
capabilities, progress will plateau for a time---at least if AIs have
their way.]{.underline} [This is because rough human-level intelligence
appears more than sufficient to recognize the risks of
self-improvement]{.underline}. But, even for humans, solving alignment
remains difficult. [Thus, rational, human-level **AIs will likely prefer
to pause improvements until alignment is solved.**]{.underline} Current
forecasts of AI risk usually assume the opposite---that a capable,
agentic AI with the ability to self-improve would very likely do so, the
better to accomplish its goals. This paper thus hopes to provide a
better picture of the level and modality of risk from AI, so that
investments in safety, including regulation, can be better targeted.

### AT\-\--AGI

#### No [AGI]{.underline}\-\--it's [structurally impossible]{.underline} and [harmless]{.underline}.

**Hoel '21** \[Erik; April 20; Neuroscientist and assistant research

Columbia University, Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of
Wisconsin Madison; The Intrinsic Perspective, "Superintelligence is
impossible,"
https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/superintelligence-is-a-free-lunch\]

I don't really buy this sort of argument, but it's nice to see some
doubt around this issue. [An increase of **skepticism** is
important]{.underline} because there's been a great deal of intellectual
resources devoted to what is, in the end, a hypothetical risk. Of
course, for getting people to seriously contemplate existential threats
is something thinkers like Nick Bostrom deserve serious credit for, as
well as credit for crafting evocative thought experiments. But I agree
with Kevin Kelly and Ted Chiang that the risk of [this particular
**existential [threat]{.mark}** [has been]{.mark} **radically
[overblown]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and, more importantly, I think the
reasons why the claims are overblown are themselves interesting and
evocative.

First, some definitions. Superintelligence refers to some entity
compared to which humans would seem like children, at minimum, or ants,
at maximum. The worrying runaway threat is that something just a bit
smarter than us might be able to build something smarter than it, etc,
so the intelligence ratchet from viewing humans as children to viewing
humans as ants would occur exponentially quickly. While such an entity
could possibly adopt a beneficent attitude toward humanity, since it's
also incomprehensible and uncontrollable, its long-term goals would
probably be orthogonal to ours in such a way that "eliminates our maps"
as it were. Regardless, even just our fates being so far outside of our
control constitutes an existential threat, especially if we can't
predict what the AI will do when we ask it for something (this is called
the alignment problem).

Certainly it's an interesting hypothetical scenario. But [all
existential threats are **not equal**. Some are [so]{.mark}
**vanishingly [small]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} their
**[probabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (rogue planets, like in the film
Melancholia) [that it would be [**madness** to]{.mark} devote a lot of
time to **[worry]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing about them. And at this point
my impression from the tremors in the world wide web is that the threat
of superintelligent AI is being ranked by a significant number of
thinkers in the same category as the threat of nuclear war. Here's Elon
Musk, speaking at MIT back in 2014:

"I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I
had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably
that."

Consider that statement. Because [[the **obvious**]{.mark} answer
to]{.underline} the question of [the biggest **existential
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which people have been giving for
decades, [[is]{.mark} the threat of **[nuclear]{.mark} annihilation**.
After all, [the risk]{.mark} of civilizational reset]{.underline}
brought about by a global nuclear war [[is]{.mark} totally [**concrete**
and]{.mark} has **[almost happened]{.mark}** on multiple occasions.
Whereas the risk of [AI is]{.mark} **totally [hypothetical]{.mark}**[,
has]{.mark} a host of **underlying** and [**unproven assumptions**,
and]{.mark} has [**never** even **gotten close**]{.mark} to
happening]{.underline}.

To deserve its title as leading or even top-tier existential threat,
[[the **arg**]{.mark}ument**[s]{.mark}** for the risk of
superintelligent AI have to be **incredibly strong**]{.underline}. Kevin
Kelly in his article does a good job listing five pretty sensible
objections (wording is his):

> 1\. Intelligence is not a single dimension, [so "smarter than humans"
> [is]{.mark} a **[meaningless]{.mark} concept**]{.underline}.
>
> 2[. [Humans do **not** have **general**]{.mark} **purpose**
> [minds]{.mark}, and [**neither** will AIs]{.mark}]{.underline}.
>
> 3\. [[Emulation]{.mark} of human thinking]{.underline} in other media
> [will be [**constrained** by cost]{.mark}]{.underline}.
>
> 4\. [Dimensions of [intelligence]{.mark} are **[not
> infinite]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

5\. Intelligences are only one factor in progress.

While he lists five separate objections, I think most actually spring
naturally from using a specific framework to think about intelligence.
Here, I'd like to explore where I think the fundamental disagreement
between believers and non-believers in superintelligence lies. Roughly,
[there are two frameworks: either an **evolutionary** one]{.underline}
(non-believers) [or a **deistic** one]{.underline} (believers).

Note that I don't mean to imply that the deistic view is wrong merely
because I've labeled it as deistic; plenty of really wonderful thinkers
have had this framework and they aren't adopting it for trivial reasons.
Rather it's deistic in that it assumes that intelligence is effectively
a single variable (or dimension) in which rocks lie at one end of the
spectrum and god-like AI lies at the other end. It's "deistic" because
it assumes that omniscience, or something indistinguishable to it from
the human perspective, is possible.

All of the points Kevin Kelly makes actually stem from him eschewing the
deistic understanding of intelligence in favor of the evolutionary.
Which framework is correct? The demarcation between the two frameworks
begins with an image, a scale laid out in Nick Bostrom's book
Superintelligence:

This is the deistic frame in a nutshell: there's some continuum from
mice up to Einstein up to near-omniscient recursively self-improved AI.

While Kelly immediately objects to this by saying that there is no
agreed upon definition of general intelligence, I think actually there
are two broad options. One is to define intelligence based on human
intelligence, which can be captured (at least statistically) with IQ.
The Intelligence Quotient holds up well across life, is heritable, and
is predictive for all the things we associate intelligence with.
Essentially, we can use the difference between low-intelligence people
and high-intelligence people as a yardstick (this is how Chiang is
arguing as well).

But clearly rating a superintelligence using an IQ test is useless. We
wouldn't use Einstein as a metric for a real superintelligence of the
variety Bostrom is worried about. The danger isn't just from an AI with
an exceptionally high IQ (since it's not like high IQ people run the
world anyways). Rather, the danger comes from the possibility of a
runaway process of a learning algorithm that creates an AI with a
god-like IQ, something different in kind. To examine is that's possible
we need a more abstract and generalizable notion of intelligence than IQ
tests.

A mathematical definition of intelligence is actually given by Legg and
Hutter in their paper "Universal intelligence: a definition of machine
intelligence." Taking their point broadly, the intelligence of an agent
is the sum of the performance of that agent on all possible problems,
weighted by the simplicity of those problems (simple problems are worth
more). A superintelligent entity would then be something that scores
extremely high on this scale.

So universal intelligence is at least describable. Interestingly,
Einstein scores pretty low on this metric. In fact, every human would
score pretty low on this metric. This is because the space of all
problems is mostly stuff that human beings are really bad at, like
picking out the same two color pixels on a TV screen (and three pixels
triads, and so on). This scale or metric for intelligence fits perfectly
with the deistic framework for intelligence, making it imaginable or at
least definable that intelligence is a dial that can be turned up
indefinitely.

In contrast, let's now introduce the evolutionary framework. In this
framework, intelligence is really about adapting to some niche portion
of the massive state space of all possible problems. Its inspiration is
On the Origin of Species, the closing of which I'll quote in full
because it's such a wonderful paragraph:

It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many
plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various
insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,
and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different
from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,
have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in
the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is
almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct
action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of
Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence
to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the
Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from
famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of
conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly
follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several
powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms
or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according
to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms
most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.

In the evolutionary framework different intelligences live together on a
tangled bank (although here the bank is pretty abstract). This is pretty
much the way our artificial intelligences live together right now. One
AI to fly the plane, another AI to filter spam from email, and so on.

[The [evolution]{.mark}ary framework of intelligence **[doesn't]{.mark}
really [allow]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} a
**[superintelligence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To draw on something
specific to support the evolutionary framework, consider the "No Free
Lunch" theorem. Taken from the abstract of the paper by Wolpert and
Macready that defines the theorem:

"A number of "no free lunch" (NFL) theorems are presented which
establish that [for any **algorithm**, any **elevated
[performance]{.mark}** [over **one**]{.mark} **class** of [problems is
**offset** by]{.mark} performance over [another]{.mark}
class."]{.underline}

[The **proof**]{.underline}, which there are multiple versions of in the
field of machine learning, search, and optimization, [is highly relevant
to the field of intelligence research. **N**o **F**ree **L**unch means
that [no]{.mark} single model, or [**optimization**, works]{.mark} best
[for **all**]{.mark} circumstances]{.underline}.

However, I don't want to rely directly on the math or the specific proof
itself, as these kinds of things are always limited in their
universality by their assumptions. The "No Free Lunch" [[theorems
are]{.mark} **true**]{.underline}, but they are also in the context of
the entirety of possibility space (without weighing these spaces by the
likelihood of their existence). I think the No Free Lunch theorem should
instead be thought of [as a concrete example of the more
**[generalizable]{.mark}** idea. Some sort of broader "**N**o **F**ree
**L**unch principle"]{.underline} (rather than theorem), [that **applies
generally** [across]{.mark} evolution,
**[intelligence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, learning, engineering, [and
function]{.underline}.

First, an argument by analogy: consider the absurdity of designing a
"superorganism" that has higher fitness in all possible environments
than the highest fitness of any extant organism in any of those
environments. While such an entity is definable, it is not
constructible. It would need to be more temperature resistant than
deep-vent bacteria, more hardy than a tardigrade, need to double faster
than bacteria, hunt better than a pack of orcas, and, well, you get the
idea. While it might be definable in terms of a fitness optimization
problem (just wave your hands about precisely how it is optimizing for
fitness), there isn't any actual such thing as a universal organism that
has a high fitness in all possible, or even just likely-here-on-Earth,
environments. Again, a superorganism that is highly fit in every
environment is definable, but not possible.

This particular free lunch is impossible in evolution because there's no
way to increase an organism's fitness in regard to all niches or
contexts. In fact, it's probably the case that increasing fitness in
regards to any particular environment necessarily decreases fitness in
regards to other environments. While environments on Earth aren't
uniform in their likelihood, they are incredibly variable and they do
change quickly. We can make a general claim that the more changeable an
environment, and the more the likelihood is spread out over diverse
environments, the more generalized No Free Lunch principle is likely to
apply.

In fact, I think it's precisely this No Free Lunch principle that
actually generates the endless forms of evolution. A mutation may
increase the fitness of an organism with regard to the current
environment, but it will often, perhaps always, decrease fitness in
regard to other environments. Since the environment is always changing,
this will forever cause a warping and shifting of where organisms are
located in the landscape of possible phenotypes. The No Free Lunch
principle is why there's no end state to evolution. And since there are
never any free lunches, evolution is the one game nobody can stop
playing. It's the game that lasts forever.

This same sort of reasoning about fitness (in regards to the
environment) applies also to intelligence (in regards to a set of
problems). [While a [superintelligence]{.mark} is definable, [it's **not
possible**. There's]{.mark} just [no **one brain**]{.mark}]{.underline},
or one neural network, [[that plays **perfect**]{.mark} Go, can pick the
two matching pixels]{.underline} of color out of the noise of a TV
screen in an instant, [move with **agility**]{.underline}, come up with
a funny story, bluff in poker, factor immensely large numbers quickly,
[[and plan]{.mark} **world [domination]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For my PhD I studied Integrated Information Theory under Giulio Tononi,
trying to come up with mathematical ways to measure when when a system
breaks down into subsystems. [It's hard to make big integra]{.underline}

[ted systems, let alone]{.underline} those that can perform [multiple
functions, and I'd posit [there is **no integrated** **constructible**
system]{.mark} that can perform **all functions**
perfectly]{.underline}.

[The **N**o **F**ree **L**unch principle shows up in intelligence
because [**whenever** you're adapting a]{.mark} **neural
[network]{.mark}**]{.underline} or an organism [to perform in some way
[you're]{.mark} **implicitly [handicapping]{.mark}** it in [some
**other** way]{.mark}]{.underline}. The infamous difficulty of getting a
neural network trained on one task to perform well on another task is
implicit proof of this.

​I recently saw a practical example of the No Free Lunch principle as
specifically concerns AI, in a talk given at Yhouse in New York City by
Julian Togelius, who studies intelligence by designing AIs that play
computer games. Here's a figure from a paper of his where they
researched how different controllers (AIs) performed across a range of
different computer games.

Basically, no controller (read, simple AI) does well across the full
selection of games (and the games aren't actually even that different).
It's not like they are trying directly to build superintelligence, but
it's a telling example of how the [**N**o **F**ree **L**unch principle
crops up even in]{.underline} what seem like [**small domains** of
expertise]{.underline}.

[**[Even if]{.mark}** there were a [**general** intelligence]{.mark}
that did okay]{.underline} across a very broad domain of problems, [it
[would be **outcompeted** by **specialists**]{.mark} willing to
sacrifice their abilities in some domains to maximize]{.underline}
abilities in [others. In fact, this is **precisely** what's happening
with artificial **neural networks**]{.underline} and human beings right
now. [It's the **generalists** who are being **replaced**]{.underline}.

If the No Free Lunch principle applies to intelligence this in turn
indicates [there will **forever** be **[endless]{.mark} forms** of
[intelligence]{.mark}. Changes to the neural architecture]{.underline}
of a network or a brain [may help with the current problems at hand, but
this [will]{.mark} **necessarily [decrease]{.mark}** its [**capability**
of]{.mark} solving **[other]{.mark} types** of [problems]{.mark}.
Overall, a **tangled bank** will emerge]{.underline}.

### AT\-\--S-Risks

#### Suffering is reversible, death is not - Focus on long term s-risks increases suffering in the short-term -- it justifies policing, war, etc

**Torres, 2021**

(Emile P. Torres -- was a PhD student at the time of writing & now has a
PhD in Philosophy from Leibniz Universität Hannover, "Against
longtermism," Oct. 19, 2021,
https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo)

Why do I think [this ideology is]{.underline} so
[dangerous]{.underline}? The short answer is that [[elevating]{.mark}
the fulfilment of [humanity's *supposed* potential above all else
could]{.mark} nontrivially [increase the probability that]{.mark} actual
[people --]{.mark} those [alive today and in the near future --
suffer]{.mark} extreme harms, even death]{.underline}. Consider that, as
I noted elsewhere, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} longtermist [[ideology
inclines]{.mark} its adherents to take [an insouciant attitude towards
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why? Because even if climate change
causes island nations to disappear, triggers mass migrations and kills
millions of people, it probably isn't going to compromise our longterm
potential over the coming trillions of years. If one takes a cosmic view
of the situation, even a climate catastrophe that cuts the human
population by 75 per cent for the next two millennia will, in the grand
scheme of things, be nothing more than a small blip -- the equivalent of
a 90-year-old man having stubbed his toe when he was two.

Bostrom's argument is that 'a non-existential disaster causing the
breakdown of global civilisation is, from the perspective of humanity as
a whole, a potentially recoverable setback.' It might be 'a giant
massacre for man', he adds, but so long as humanity bounces back to
fulfil its potential, it will ultimately register as little more than 'a
small misstep for mankind'. Elsewhere, he writes that [[the
worst]{.mark} natural [disasters]{.mark} [and]{.mark} devastating
[atrocities]{.mark} in history [become]{.mark} almost [imperceptible
trivialities]{.mark} when seen from this grand perspective.]{.underline}
[[Referring to]{.mark} the two [world wars, AIDS and]{.mark} the
[Chernobyl]{.mark} nuclear accident]{.underline}, he declares that
'tragic as such events are to the people immediately affected, [in the
big picture]{.underline} of things ... even the worst of
[these]{.underline} catastrophes [are mere ripples on the surface of the
great sea of life.']{.underline}

[This way of seeing the world, of assessing the badness of AIDS and the
Holocaust, implies that future disasters of the same (non-existential)
scope and intensity should also be categorised as 'mere
ripples'.]{.underline} If they don't pose a direct existential risk,
then we ought not to worry much about them, however tragic they might be
to individuals. As Bostrom wrote in 2003, 'priority number one, two,
three and four should ... be to reduce existential risk.' He reiterated
this several years later in arguing that we mustn't 'fritter ... away'
our finite resources on 'feel-good projects of suboptimal efficacy' such
as alleviating global poverty and reducing animal suffering, since
neither threatens our longterm potential, and our longterm potential is
what really matters.

Ord echoes these views in arguing that, of all the problems facing
humanity, our 'first great task ... is to reach a place of safety -- a
place where existential risk' -- as he defines it -- 'is low and stays
low', which he dubs 'existential security'. More than anything else,
what matters is doing everything necessary to 'preserve' and 'protect'
our potential by 'extracting ourselves from immediate danger' and
devising robust 'safeguards that will defend humanity from dangers over
the longterm future, so that it becomes impossible to fail.' Although
Ord gives a nod to climate change, he also claims -- based on a dubious
methodology -- that the chance of climate change causing an existential
catastrophe is only ∼1 in 1,000, which is a whole two orders of
magnitude lower than the probability of superintelligent machines
destroying humanity this century, according to Ord.

What's really notable here is that [[the]{.mark} central [concern isn't
the effect of the climate catastrophe on]{.mark} actual
[people]{.mark}]{.underline} around the world (remember, in the grand
scheme, this would be, in Bostrom's words, a 'small misstep for
mankind') but the slim possibility that, as Ord puts it in The
Precipice, this catastrophe 'poses a risk of an unrecoverable collapse
of civilisation or even the complete extinction of humanity'. Again,
[[the harms caused to actual people (especially]{.mark} those [in the
Global South]{.mark}) might be significant in absolute terms, but [when
compared to the]{.mark}]{.underline} 'vastness' and '[[**glory'** of our
longterm potential in the cosmos,]{.mark} they [hardly]{.mark} even
[register]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Yet [the implications]{.underline} of longtermism [are]{.underline} far
more [worrisome]{.underline}. If our top four priorities are to avoid an
existential catastrophe -- ie, to **[fulfil 'our potential' -- then
what's not on the table for making this happen?]{.underline}** Consider
Thomas Nagel's comment about how the notion of what we might call the
'greater good' has been used to 'justify' certain atrocities (eg, during
war). If the ends 'justify' the means, he argues, and the ends are
thought to be sufficiently large (eg, national security), then this 'can
be brought to bear to ease the consciences of those responsible for a
certain number of charred babies'. Now imagine **[[what might be
'justified' if the 'greater good' isn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** national
**[[security but the cosmic potential of Earth-]{.mark}originating
intelligent life [over]{.mark} the coming [trillions of
years?]{.mark}]{.underline}** During the Second World War, 40 million
civilians perished, but compare this number to the 1054 or more people
(in Bostrom's estimate) who could come to exist if we can avoid an
existential catastrophe. What shouldn't we do to 'protect' and
'preserve' this potential? To ensure that these unborn people come to
exist? What means can't be 'justified' by this cosmically significant
moral end?

Bostrom himself argued that we should seriously consider establishing
[[a global, invasive surveillance system]{.mark} that monitors every
person on the planet in realtime]{.underline}, to amplify the
'capacities for preventive policing' (eg, to prevent omnicidal terrorist
attacks that could devastate civilisation). Elsewhere, he's written that
[states should use preemptive [violence/war]{.mark}]{.underline} to
avoid existential catastrophes, and argued that [[saving billions of
actual people is]{.underline}]{.mark} the moral equivalent of reducing
existential risk by utterly [[minuscule]{.underline}]{.mark} amounts. In
his words, even if there is 'a mere 1 per cent chance' of 1054 people
existing in the future, then 'the expected value of reducing existential
risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is
worth 100 billion times as much as a billion human lives.' [[Such
fanaticism]{.mark} --]{.underline} *[a word that some longtermists
embrace]{.underline}* -- [[has led]{.mark} a growing number of [critics
to worry]{.mark} about [what might happen]{.mark} if political leaders
in the real world were to take Bostrom's view seriously]{.underline}. To
quote the mathematical statistician Olle Häggström, who -- perplexingly
-- tends otherwise to speak favourably of longtermism:

I feel extremely uneasy about the prospect that \[the calculations
above\] might become recognised among politicians and decision-makers as
a guide to policy worth taking literally. It is simply too reminiscent
of the old saying 'If you want to make an omelette, you must be willing
to break a few eggs,' which has typically been used to explain that a
bit of genocide or so might be a good thing, if it can contribute to the
goal of creating a future utopia. Imagine a situation where the head of
the CIA explains to the US president that they have credible evidence
that somewhere in Germany, there is a lunatic who is working on a
doomsday weapon and intends to use it to wipe out humanity, and that
this lunatic has a one-in-a-million chance of succeeding. They have no
further information on the identity or whereabouts of this lunatic. If
the president has taken Bostrom's argument to heart, and if he knows how
to do the arithmetic, he may conclude that it is worthwhile conducting a
full-scale nuclear assault on Germany to kill every single person within
its borders.

#### Infinite suffering similations are wrong.

[There could also be massive [simulations]{.mark} running on exoplanets
that have been converted into computronium [in which billions]{.mark} of
sentient simulants [suffer]{.mark} **immense agony**]{.underline}. Given
the huge number of future beings who could exist if we do colonize
space, it stands to reason that someone somewhere would run such
simulations (perhaps from within a simulation), create new biospheres in
which wild animals are subject to Darwinian misery, and so on.
**[Clearly]{.underline}**, [the account [is
**biased**]{.mark},]{.underline} [since [it does not tell us anything
about the **upside** of such simulations, which would **counterbalance
the negative value created even on the most suffering-averse moral
theories**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [And [if humanity]{.mark}
**refrains** from space colonization and inevitably [goes
extinct]{.mark} -- due to either local Hobbesian warfare or a natural
cataclysm -- wild animals will (**surprise, surprise!**) continue to be
subject to "Darwinian misery" on Earth and on **infinite number of other
habitable planets in the universe**]{.underline}. Perhaps the least
importantly, [Torres]{.underline} inadvertently
**[conflates]{.underline}** [the two interpretations of the
**"orthogonality thesis" of Bostrom**]{.underline} (2012, 2014).
Orthogonality thesis as originally conceived applies to the possible
evolutionary pathways of a superintelligent AI, or a posthuman species,
or perhaps an extraterrestrial intelligent species. Its generalization
to a large set of such entities at any particular epoch in time is not
warranted, since the evolution of such entities is likely to be strongly
non-ergodic (to fill just a small region of the overall parameter
space). It is easy to understand why this is so: while the orthogonality
thesis allows for a stock example of paperclip maximizer, as well as,
for example, spaceship maximizer, it certainly does not tell us that the
two are on the same footing in a wider scheme of things. Obviously, the
spaceship maximizer would have made a short work of the paperclip
maximizer in any realistic conflict, violent or not, if they start from
the same initial conditions and distribution of resources. Therefore, it
is far likelier that the spaceship maximizer would be able to leave
progeny (in sufficiently broad sense of the term) and fill the universe
with its spaceship-maximizing values, rather than the
paperclip-maximizing values. Therefore, [it is naïve to conclude that
the validity of the orthogonality thesis suggests that the unconstrained
future evolution will bring about equipartition of the available design
space and that all kinds of posthuman species could be encountered in
equal measure. Quite the contrary, [it is likely that **nonsensical**
evolutionary trajectories, like those leading to the **paperclip
maximizing**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [will be driven to **zero relative
frequency**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, the original, microevolutionary
version of the orthogonality thesis does not entail the wider,
macroevolutionary version. And we need macroevolutionary insights in
order to assess the merits and demerits of our future space colonization
efforts.

### AT\-\--Death K

#### Examining death in [educational spaces]{.underline} fosters [empathy]{.underline}, encourages [critical thinking]{.underline}, and [reduces]{.underline} anxiety.

Psychology: The Impact of a Death Education Course for Italian
University Students," National Library of Medicine;
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952646/\]

The present [**[study]{.mark}** investigated the **effects
of**]{.underline} a hybrid online course [on]{.underline} a group of
Italian Master's degree [students]{.underline} involved in a European
Erasmus+ project. The course was composed of nine modules about **[death
education]{.underline}**, palliative psychology and the use of creative
arts therapies---such as psychodrama, intermodal psychodrama and
photovoice---in the end-of-life-field. The project involved 64 students
in the experimental group (who attended the course) and 56 students as
the control group. Both groups completed an online questionnaire before
and after the delivery of the course and 10 students from the
experimental group participated in a focus group at the end of the
course. The [quantitative analysis **[revealed]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that the experimental group [students showed lesser]{.underline} levels
of [perception of death as annihilation]{.underline}, fear of the death
and [death avoidance]{.underline}, while they
**[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark}** their levels of death acceptance,
[creative **[self-efficacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [**attitude
toward** the **[care]{.mark}** of the dying]{.underline}. Qualitative
analysis identified three main themes: the [positive impact]{.underline}
of the course [on]{.underline} death education and [end-of-life
care]{.underline}; the role of art therapies on death and end-of-life
care; and the unhelpful facets of the course. Overall, this intervention
[**changed** the **perception** and]{.underline} the
[feelings]{.underline} of the students **[regarding]{.underline}** the
themes of **[death]{.underline}** and palliative psychology and
[increased]{.underline} their creative [self-efficacy]{.underline} and
their interest in working in an end-of-life field. The term death
education denotes a set of activities that aim to **[[promote
reflection]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [facilitate
[understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} and the processing of dysfunctional
emotions **[[on existential issues]{.underline}]{.mark}** concerning
death, dying and bereavement \[1,2\]. The objectives of these activities
are to provide general information about death and dying [[**through**
simple]{.mark} and appropriate **[language]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to
create a space for reflection on the meaning of life and death, to
[[strengthen **critical thinking**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to
stimulate [discussion]{.underline} on feelings [of anxiety]{.underline},
suffering and fear provoked by the thought of death and dying \[2,3\].
Death education interventions are delivered at three different
levels: 1. Primary: this encompasses educational interventions in which
the topic of death is addressed with participants who are not personally
or closely experiencing death, and sharing the related emotions; 2.
Secondary: when accompanying a person to death, providing support to the
bereaved and their loved ones; 3. when the bereavement of a missing
person is processed \[4,5\]. The literature shows that death education
interventions are relevant because they
**[[reduce]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [attitudes of
**[fear]{.mark}**]{.underline} or death avoidance \[6,7,8,9,10,11\],
help participants to develop positive attitudes toward death and dying
and allow participants to view death as a natural transition at the end
of life \[9,12[\]. Death education]{.underline} interventions have also
been [proven]{.underline} to be [effective in
**[fostering]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[recognition]{.underline}]{.mark}** and expression [of
feelings]{.underline} related to the topic of death \[3,4,9\] and in
[**[strengthening]{.mark}** expressive and creative
**[skills]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when associated with art therapies
\[12,13\]. [[Discussing]{.underline}]{.mark} the topic of
[death]{.underline} in a welcoming and non-judgmental environment
[provides individuals with more effective language]{.underline} to
adequately express the emotions related to this topic \[3,9\] and
increases empathic understanding \[14,15\]. [Discussing]{.underline}
one's [[mortality]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[motivate people to
**improve** their]{.underline}]{.mark} physical and mental
**[[health]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [prioritize growth-oriented
**[goals]{.mark}**, and increase **[life
satisfaction]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[16,17\]. Among the methods used in
death education interventions, the literature indicates that creative
arts therapies have proven to be effective in [promoting participants'
psychological well-being]{.underline} \[9,18,19\]. In particular, the
literature shows that the use of creative arts therapies in death
education interventions brings [beneficial effects
regarding]{.underline} the [recognition of]{.underline} the end
expression of [emotions]{.underline} related to the themes of death and
dying, [to **better [manage]{.mark}** fear and death
**[anxiety]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the grieving process \[9,18,20\].
The term arts therapies encompasses multiple methods of psychological
support/psychotherapy: art therapy, dance/movement therapy, drama
therapy, psychodrama, music therapy and bibliotherapy \[21\]. By
fostering creative expression, creative arts therapies succeed in
enhancing the well-being of participants by providing adequate
psychological support \[22,23\]. Previous studies have shown that the
use of psychodrama in death education has proven to be effective in the
processing of dysfunctional emotions related to talking about the topic
\[8,12\] anticipatory grief \[18\], and bereavement processing
\[24,25\]. In addition, psychodrama has been shown to be useful in
improving participants' communicative and descriptive skills regarding
feelings related to death \[9,18\], bringing participants' attention to
their own inner dimensions \[9\]. The term psychodrama indicates a
method devised by J. L. Moreno used in psychotherapy and psychological
support that uses dramatization to explore the emotions and personal or
collective experiences of the participants' inner world \[26,27\].
Through this method, the participant is engaged in listening to the
different parts of his/her internal world and relationship, initiating
an internal dialogue that guides him/her to discover possible solutions
to his/her intrapsychic and/or relational conflicts with the external
world \[28\], re-experiencing past experiences and reaching a higher
level of consciousness and self-knowledge \[29\]. When psychodrama is
combined with other creative arts therapies, it is called intermodal
psychodrama \[30\]. One example is the CBN psychodrama model that
integrates visual art making with cognitive behavioral therapy and
narrative therapy \[31\]. A second example is the Kinetic Family in
Action assessment method that integrates drawing, writing and role
playing \[32\]. Another artistic method used effectively in death
education interventions is photovoice \[5,9\]. Photovoice uses
photography as an expressive and communicative channel, with the aim of
increasing knowledge and understanding of a given social phenomenon and
to integrate the knowledge gained with interventions of a political, or
social nature or, in general, for the benefit of community members
\[33,34\]. In this method, participants are asked to express their
perspectives, views, and feelings toward a research topic through
photography. First, the participants take a picture on a certain theme
or topic, and associate a short caption to their photo. Subsequently,
they discuss the taken photo and the given caption as a group and can
choose the most representative photo from those in the group, possibly
changing the caption and elaborating on further dialogues on the
research topics \[33,34\]. The literature confirms that the use of
photovoice in death education interventions increases the level of
wellbeing and self-awareness in participants \[12,35\], contributes to a
decrease in the fear of death and a more positive attitude towards
death, and fosters a greater understanding and expression of feelings
related to bereavement and managing death anxiety \[5,9,35\]. The aim of
the present study was to evaluate the impact of a death education and
palliative psychology course, associated with art therapy activities, on
Psychology master's degree students from the University of Padova
(Italy). In particular, the impact of the course on the perception and
vision of death was assessed, and it was investigated whether
psychodrama and photovoice could represent effective clinical tools
within death education and palliative psychology courses and the change
in professional interest towards the field of palliative care was
evaluated. [[The **study**]{.mark} followed]{.underline} an explanatory
sequential [mixed methods design]{.underline}, that **[[consisted
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** a first [quantitative
**research**]{.underline} phase in which the quantitative
**[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}** were [collected and **analyzed**,
[followed by]{.mark}]{.underline} a qualitative
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} phase to [explain the]{.underline}
qualitative [results in more detail]{.underline} \[36\]. The
quantitative phase consisted in the administration of an online
questionnaire to the experimental group before and after the project
intervention and at the same time to the control group. The qualitative
phase consisted in the participation of 10 students in the experimental
group in a focus group, which took place after the participation in the
project intervention.

The [[Coast Guard's]{.mark} Polar Security Cutter
[program]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[received]{.mark} \$[4.3
billion]{.mark} [under]{.mark} the [federal budget
bill]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} isn't expected to deliver its first
new ship until 2030 at the earliest.

When that ship, the Polar Sentinel, arrives in service, it likely will
replace the Polar Star, which was commissioned in 1976 and is primarily
used to keep open the sea lanes to American research stations in
Antarctica.

Additional ships are expected in the following years.

The budget bill [also contains \$[3.5 billion]{.mark}]{.underline} for a
new [Arctic Security Cutter]{.underline} [program]{.underline}, which
seeks to launch a lighter icebreaker within three years of a contract
being awarded.

That ship, according to published specifications, would only be able to
break ice up to 3 feet thick, less than the capability of the Coast
Guard's sole medium icebreaker, the Healy, and equivalent to a Class-5
icebreaker, second-lowest on the six-level international standards
rankings.

The bill also contains [\$[816 million]{.mark} to procure
additional]{.underline}, unspecified light and medium icebreaking
cutters.

That could involve buying and converting commercial ships.

Next month, the Coast Guard is expected to commission the icebreaker
Storis in Juneau. That ship was formerly the Arctic oil drilling support
ship Aiviq but was purchased by the Coast Guard as an interim
icebreaking solution.

Speaking Friday, Little confirmed that the Storis will be operating on a
more limited basis until it undergoes a comprehensive refit.

"She'll be transitioning from kind of an initial operating capability
into what we'll eventually consider full operational capability," he
said. "But that doesn't diminish the fact that we'll have a U.S. Coast
Guard cutter, painted red with a Coast Guard stripe, operating in the
region this summer."

The budget bill [includes [\$300 million]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[construct]{.mark} a [new]{.mark} [port]{.mark}]{.underline} and support
facilities in Juneau to support the Storis, but Little said he didn't
have any information Friday on the timeline for construction and
development.

For this summer, he said, the plan is to "limit the mission space" for
the Storis until its crew and the Coast Guard are familiar with the ship

"We'll step into that very thoughtfully," he said.

Friday's ceremony didn't include as much discussion of aviation. The
budget bill includes \$2.3 billion for up to 40 new MH-60 helicopters,
the long-distance workhorses of Coast Guard heliborne aviation.

It also allocates [\$[1.1 billion]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [six new]{.mark}
HC-130J fixed-wing aircraft]{.underline}. In Alaska, five of those
aircraft are based at Kodiak and used for extremely long-range
search-and-rescue missions, as well as "[[Arctic domain"]{.mark} flights
t]{.underline}hat can involve flights along the American border in the
Arctic Ocean.

The budget bill also contains [\$[2.2 billion]{.mark} for new
maintenance facilities nationally, [\$4.4 billion]{.mark} for shoreside
facilities]{.underline} --- including the \$[[300]{.mark} million for
Juneau --- and [\$266]{.mark} million for long-range drone
aircraft,]{.underline} an under-developed area for the Coast Guard.

Little said that [kind of [spending is a "fundamental
change]{.mark}]{.underline}" for the Coast Guard, whose annual budget is
only about \$14 billion.

Coming into his new job, he said he's aware that as ship traffic
increases in the Arctic Ocean and surrounding waters, there are
["increased risks, increased commercial traffic, increased tourist
traffic, cruise ships, and increased access to what were otherwise
hard-to-access waters."]{.underline}

LF

[The Norwegian government proposes to increase the defense budget for
2025 by NOK 19.2 billion, up to a total of NOK 110.1
billion.]{.underline} The proposal fulfills the first major promise of
the Norwegian long-term defence plan and exceeds NATO\'s target of its
members spending 2.16 percent of their gross national product (GDP) on
defense.

\- The government prioritizes security because the world has become less
safe. [With this budget proposal we are taking greater responsibility
both for our own security and for allied security.]{.underline} Just as
promised in our defense long-term plan that was approved by a united
Parliament earlier this year, says Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram
(Sp).

[The government proposes:]{.underline}

To increase the allocation to the Norwegian Armed Forces by
approximately NOK 5 billion. **[The money will mainly be spent on more
ammunition, better preparedness and more people.]{.underline}**

[To increase material investments by over NOK 7 billion. The main part
of the money will go to projects already started, and will include new
F-35 combat aircrafts with the necessary additional equipment and
services, new submarines, maritime surveillance capacity, maritime
helicopter capacity, artillery ammunition and sensors for military
airspace surveillance.]{.underline}

[An increase of investments in property and construction with NOK 1
billion for value preservation and renewal, and an increase of NOK 600
million for investments]{.underline}. This will provide better living
conditions for the personnel in the Armed Forces and increased
operational capability.

[To strengthen the Home Guard with NOK 277 million.]{.underline}

[To increase the educational capacity for basic officer training by
around 50, and strengthen efforts to recruit and retain
people.]{.underline}

\- [We will continue the growth in the number of soldiers and employees
in 2025, and we will take measures to make it more attractive to serve
in the Armed Forces, says the Minister of Defence.]{.underline}

The government will increase the number of employees by around 300, 400
more conscripts and 600 more reservists by the end of 2025.

[Norway met NATO\'s two percent target in 2024 after the strengthening
in the revised national budget. In 2025, the estimate for GDP share -
with the government\'s proposal - will be around 2.15 per
cent]{.underline}. If the Nansen funds, including re-acquisitions, are
excluded, the GDP share is 2.16 per cent.

The increase in the defense budget, without technical changes,
compensation for price and wage growth and currency adjustment of large
investments, is NOK 16.5 billion. [The nominal **increase in the defense
budget is about 21.2 per cent compared to the balanced budget for
2024**.]{.underline}

Missile launchers illuminated under the glowing green fingers of the
northern lights, white-and-gray camo with fur-lined hoods, Green Berets
perched two to a snowmobile---these were the scenes from Arctic Edge in
2022, a biannual joint training exercise first convened in 2018 to train
troops to operate in the marginal conditions north of the Arctic Circle.

"\[These exercises\] bring us all together as a joint, combined, and
allied force to think about how we can defend the Arctic, how we can
work together to not just survive up here, but thrive and be able to
protect our homeland," the commander of the military's Alaskan Command,
Lt. Gen. David Krumm, said after the 2022 exercise.

In recent years, the U.S. military has highlighted exercises like this
to underscore the importance of the Arctic, trumpeting its commitment to
protecting U.S. security interests there.

The military "must be able to ... shape the security environment" in the
region, states the Pentagon's 2019 congressional report on Arctic
strategy.

"U.S. Naval forces must operate more assertively across the Arctic
Region," proclaims the Navy's "Strategic Blueprint for the Arctic,"
released in 2021.

The Army published its strategy for "regaining Arctic dominance" the
same year.

But while these and other recent policies highlight the region's
critical importance, along with the military's growing interest in it as
climate change reshapes the polar environment, experts argue [the United
States has done little to commit the **targeted, long-term investment**
or build up the capacity needed to lead in the Arctic.]{.underline}

"We don't have the capability to sustain forces up there," says Ryan
Burke, the research director of the Homeland Defense Institute at U.S.
Northern Command, as well as an affiliate professor at University of
Alaska Fairbanks' Center for Arctic Security and Resilience and the
co-director of Project 6633 at West Point's Modern War Institute. ["We
don't have the **infrastructure**, [we don't have the **know-how**, we
don't have the]{.mark} [**institutional knowledge.** We don't have any
of what we need]{.mark} to be present, let alone to actually dominate
the damn thing."]{.underline}

As interest in the region grows, the military has begun to make some
changes. In December, Finland, which joined NATO this year, gave the
U.S. military access to 15 Finnish bases and the ability to store
weapons and equipment in the country; Sweden, which has applied to join
NATO, also gave the U.S. access to 17 bases. The agreements follow a
similar pact with Norway the previous year. In 2022, Eielson Air Force
Base, just over 100 miles south of the Arctic Circle, stood up a full
complement of F-35s. Marine units now rotate through cold-weather
training with their Norwegian counterparts, and during the past several
years, U.S. forces have participated in trainings like Arctic Edge or
Arctic Challenge, a Nordic-led joint military exercise.

[But much of the [necessary **communication systems**]{.mark}, general
infrastructure, [and, **critically**, sustained]{.mark} [**presence and
training** needed to understand and operate in such a complex
environment has yet to]{.mark} [materialize.]{.mark} The lofty visions
promised in recent strategies don't always match the realities on the
ground.]{.underline}

"The Army is a land force," Burke says of the Army's promise to
"dominate" the region. "The Arctic is principally a maritime domain."

As for the maritime side of things, [the [U.S. military has **just two
functional polar icebreakers**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Plans to bring on
additional ships have been repeatedly delayed. The operational capacity
of the U.S. military to regulate economic interests or respond to a
large-scale event, such as an oil spill or a mass casualty scenario,
isn't assured.

"The Army has a strategy, the Navy has a strategy, the Air Force has a
strategy," Burke says. "Congratulations. We can't do any of it."

**[['You Need Lots of Other Things']{.underline}]{.mark}**

Sixty years ago, at the height of the Cold War, the U.S. icebreaker
fleet was quadruple the size it is today. The Navy and the Coast Guard
operated seven heavily armed Wind Class diesel-electric ships between
them, along with the Coast Guard cutter Glacier, a larger heavy
icebreaker operated first by the Navy and then by the Coast Guard.

"During the Cold War, the Arctic was probably more important militarily
than ever before in history," says Scott Savitz, a senior engineer at
RAND who worked on a recent report assessing U.S. military arctic
capabilities. "It was the literal high ground. There was recognition
that if missiles were going to be flying between North America and the
Soviet Union, most of them would be going that way."

In the 1970s, as the Coast Guard decommissioned the Wind Class cutters
after decades in service, [the service brought two new heavy icebreakers
online: the Polar Sea and the Polar Star.]{.underline}

The Sea and the Star were joined by the Healy, a medium-class
icebreaker, in 1999. (Full disclosure: I served on the Healy as a Coast
Guard officer from 2009 to 2011.) Today, only the Polar Star---more than
45 years old---and the Healy are operational. The Polar Sea has been out
of service since 2010, slowly cannibalized for parts.

[Compare that with Russia's icebreaker fleet: More than 45 military
ships and counting]{.underline}---three additional ships are under
construction, and Vladimir Putin has said the country plans to have 13
new icebreakers online by 2035. Even China, a thousand miles from the
Arctic Circle, just laid the hull for its third icebreaker.

For years, the Coast Guard and Navy have been jointly developing a new
class of icebreakers: polar security cutters, heavy icebreakers, the
largest the United States has ever commissioned. The plan is for just
three new ships---to be followed, at some undefined point in the future,
by three additional medium icebreakers---but the program has been
repeatedly delayed and plagued by design issues. A GAO report last
summer found the Polar Security Cutter program was still at risk of a
"costly rework and further delays."

And while comparisons of the United States' paltry icebreaker fleet to
Russia's and China's are useful shorthand for the state of the country's
Arctic investment, the reality of the U.S. security landscape in the
Arctic is far more complex.

[**"Polar [icebreakers are necessary, but not sufficient]{.mark},"**
Savitz says. "You need lots of other things."]{.underline}

Chief among them are building up the capacity for [[domain
awareness]{.mark} and [operational readiness]{.mark}]{.underline}: the
[**[costly infrastructure]{.underline}**---]{.mark}things like
communications systems, equipment, and assets, along with the ability to
maintain them---[that helps the military understand what is happening in
the environment, and the [sustained presence of people]{.mark} who can
monitor that information and respond if necessary. For the most part,
[the United States has neither.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The most recent Pentagon Arctic strategy was released in 2019. It
emphasizes that Arctic security is U.S. security, and it focuses on
three lines of efforts in the region: improving domain awareness,
increasing operations, and bolstering rules-based order. But while it
nods to things like cold weather training and joint exercises, it does
little to pinpoint specific or significant fiscal or resource
commitments.

"I think a lot of people have done a good job laying out what needs to
happen to improve U.S. access and presence in the Arctic," says Abbie
Tingstad, a research professor at the Center for Arctic Study and Policy
at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, as well as the lead author on the
recent RAND study, conducted while she was with RAND. "Now it just costs
money and time and getting organized."

In 2022, the department stood up an Arctic Strategy and Global
Resilience Office to guide U.S. security strategy in the region and help
coordinate the three combatant commands that have responsibility over
the region: U.S. Northern Command, U.S. European Command, and U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command.

A national strategy for the Arctic, released by the White House in 2022,
highlights security as its first strategic pillar for the region,
pointing specifically to the need to "develop capabilities for expanded
Arctic activity."

Defense Department officials say an updated version of its Arctic
strategy will be released early this year.

"This was one of those areas where we could have gotten out in front of
it," says Cameron Carlson, the assistant director of the Center for
Arctic Security and Resilience and dean of the College of Business and
Security Management at University of Alaska Fairbanks. "And I think
every year that slips, we---especially on the DOD side---we end up
taking a step farther and farther back from it because we really haven't
defined what our true Arctic interests are, what our stake will be here
for the long term."

**[['Everything Breaks in the Arctic']{.underline}]{.mark}**

There are many reasons for the gulf that exists between platitudes in
policy and priorities in practice, but a primary one is just the sheer
complexity of operating in the Arctic. [[Maintaining equipment and
conducting operations in such an extremely cold environment]{.mark}
require unique standards and approaches.]{.underline}

[["Everything breaks]{.mark} in the Arctic," Savitz says. ["Fuels gel,
lubricants don't. The batteries fail, the materials shatter and snap,
**everything is iced over.** And it's extremely hard on
humans."]{.mark}]{.underline}

For instance, in the Pentagon's announcement of its Arctic strategy
office, Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for
Arctic and global resilience, pointed out that [much of the military's
[infrastructure]{.mark} in the far north [is **built on permafrost**,
which is melting as the planet warms.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"We're working to mitigate that," Ferguson said at the time.

[The harsh [environment makes continued maintenance paramount---a
challenge in budget cycles]{.mark} that tend to favor shiny new toys.
And the region's exceptional parameters mean equipment designed for the
Arctic might not be particularly useful elsewhere---another **[tough
fiscal sell.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Take the Navy's surface fleet, for example. U.S. naval submarines have,
for decades, operated in the Arctic---but primarily out of sight,
intentionally. The Navy's Arctic strategy promises an "enhanced
presence" in the Arctic, pledging to "provide our Sailors, Marines, and
Civilians with the education, training, and equipment necessary to
preserve peace and respond to crises in the region."

That's a complicated promise.

["[If you create a surface fleet that is specific to that region ...
that will become a heavier ship,"]{.mark} Carlson says. ["And heavier
ships don't move as fast. **They're not as agile. They're not as fuel
efficient."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

So instead, the Navy's strategy points to partnerships with the Coast
Guard, which has more institutional knowledge about Arctic operations as
well as the military's only icebreakers.

"The Coast Guard has been the most active of any of the services in
trying to maintain Arctic capabilities and build capacity," Savitz says.

In part, that's because of the nature of Arctic security: It's more
about competition than it is about conflict. The Coast Guard is used to
a mission set that focuses on enforcing laws and regulations, and
responding when things go wrong.

For the other military branches, being told to wait around "in a place
that is remote, and where it's really hard to operate, and where you're
likely going to have various systems fail, when there's intense
attention on other parts of the world, or flare-ups, or crises" isn't
popular, Savitz says. "Part of the problem is that there is such a
strong nondefense component of security up there."

[But the [Coast Guard]{.mark}, as the only military branch housed in the
Department of Homeland Security, is **[always]{.mark} [strapped for
cash]{.mark}**, and the need for U.S. presence and response in the
Arctic is only growing, analysts argue. A shrinking ice cap and
increasing ship traffic raise questions about regulating things like
fisheries and access to other resources, or enforcing international
standards. And then there's the issue of what happens if things go
wrong---like an environmental catastrophe or a search-and-rescue
disaster.]{.underline}

"The intersection of climate change and, say, economic factors, or the
intersection of changing demographics---all of those combinations also
then create these situations where I think these black swan-type events
may become a little bit more frequent," Tingstad says. "The U.S. as a
whole has such global priorities---something has to get racked and
stacked, and that's certainly understandable. But from an Arctic
perspective, of course, the concern is that it's low probability. It
feels low probability until it actually happens."

Other Arctic nations, particularly Russia, which has a substantial
military and economic presence in the region, may be better poised to
respond---and its day-to-day operations there raise questions about
whose values and interests are prioritized in the Arctic.

"Presence equals influence, and influence often translates to power,"
Burke says. "The point being is that if we collectively want to be
influential, and have any sort of power position in the Arctic
whatsoever, we actually need to be there."

//aka \-\-- ableist language is struck through and replaced in brackets.

Donald Trump sat down with The Atlantic a couple of weeks ago, and when
the discussion turned to his beleaguered defense secretary, the
president offered support --- in an awkwardly worded way. "I think he's
gonna get it together," Trump said about Pete Hegseth.

That might yet be true, but **[[the]{.mark} hapless [Pentagon
chief]{.mark} apparently [hasn't gotten it together]{.mark}
yet.]{.underline}**

[While Hegseth's entire tenure at the Department of Defense has been a
shambolic mess, the last week has been **especially
brutal**.]{.underline} Last Tuesday, for example, [the secretary took
steps to end the Pentagon's Women, Peace and Security program,
condemning it as a "woke" initiative championed by "feminists and
left-wing activists."]{.underline} What Hegseth apparently didn't know
was that Trump championed the program, characterizing it as a key
first-term accomplishment, after it was crafted by Marco Rubio and
Kristi Noem --- two of Hegseth's Cabinet colleagues.

One day later, The Washington Post published a deeply unflattering
report about [[Hegseth elevating his third]{.mark} [wife to an
"unorthodox role" shaping Pentagon affairs,]{.mark} which has apparently
[not been well received within]{.mark} [the
department.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[One day after that, The Wall Street Journal reported that the [Pentagon
inspector general decided to]{.mark} ["expand an investigation into
Hegseth's sharing of military plans to a second Signal chat that
included his wife and brother."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[As this week got underway, his troubles intensified: The Journal also
reported that [Hegseth used]{.mark} the [Signal]{.mark} messaging app
[for]{.mark} official [Pentagon]{.mark} business [more extensively
than]{.mark} had been previously [disclosed]{.mark}, "engaging in at
least a dozen separate chats." Soon after, Reuters reported that
[Hegseth sparked]{.mark} [**widespread confusion** among national
security officials]{.mark} in January [when he **unilaterally halted**
an arms]{.mark} [shipment to Ukraine]{.mark}, catching the White House
off guard.]{.underline}

It was against this backdrop that the former Fox News personality did
what he's done several times before: [Hegseth [advanced]{.mark} his
ongoing [purge of U.S. military leaders]{.mark}.]{.underline} The New
York Times reported:

Defense Secretary Pete [Hegseth ordered a [20 percent reduction of
four-star officers]{.mark} --- the military's [senior]{.mark}
[ranks]{.mark} --- continuing the wide swath of job reductions and
firings that have marked his three months at the helm of the Pentagon.
In a memo on Monday, Mr. Hegseth also [ordered a 10 percent reduction of
overall]{.mark} [general]{.mark}-level [officers]{.mark} in the
military, and a [20 percent cut of four-star positions in the National
Guard.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Through these measures, we will uphold our position as the most lethal
fighting force in the world, achieving peace through strength and
ensuring greater efficiency, innovation and preparedness for achieving
any challenge that lies ahead," the secretary said.

That's certainly one way to look at the developments. But as NBC News
noted, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, indicated Hegseth's explanation for the
dismissals fell short.

["I have always advocated for efficiency at the Department of Defense,
but tough personnel decisions should be based on facts and analysis, not
arbitrary percentages," Reed said in a statement. "[Eliminating
the]{.mark} [positions of]{.mark} many of [our most skilled and
experienced officers without sound justification would not
create]{.mark} ['efficiency' in the military --- it could]{.mark}
~~cripple~~ [\[destroy\] it."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Base Property and Historical Use

The former Naval Air Facility (NAF) Adak is located approximately 1,200
miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. The first inhabitants of Adak were
the Aleuts as early as 9,000 years ago. Russians began trading with the
Aleuts by the 1750s. The permanent Aleut villages were abandoned in the
1830s; however, seasonal and subsistence use of the island continued
until World War II (WWII). During WWII, Adak became a military base
operated by the Army Air Corps for defensive action against Japanese
forces occupying Attu and Kiska. As many as 90,000 troops mobilized to
the Aleutians during the peak military activity. After the war, Adak was
transferred to the US Air Force and operated until about 1950, at which
time the Navy took over operations. About 79,200 acres of the 180,000
acre Adak Island were set aside for Navy use in 1959 under Public Land
Order 1949. The remainder of the island remained part of the Aleutian
Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The number of military personnel on
Adak has fluctuated, but had not generally exceeded 6,000 persons
(outside of WWII). In 1980, under Public Law 96-487, the Aleutian
Islands National Wildlife Refuge was placed in the Alaska Maritime
National Wildlife Refuge.

Closure Dates

[By 1994, [**all military dependents had transferred** from
Adak]{.mark}. The Former Naval Air Facility was [listed]{.mark}
[under]{.mark} the [Base Realignment and Closure Program]{.mark} in July
1995.]{.underline} The military mission at Adak ended on March 31, 1997.
[The former base had two areas with extensive development. The first was
the \"downtown\" area, where the NAF was located. This area included an
airfield, port facilities, landfills, sewage treatment facilities, light
industrial, administration, commercial, recreational, and residential
areas. The second main area was formerly used by the Naval Security
Group Activity in the northern part of the island. Only the downtown
area is currently being used.]{.underline}

[On March 17, [2004]{.mark}, about [41,700 acres were transferred **from

The former Adak Navy Air Facility (NAF) is located near the center of
the Aleutian chain, approximately 1,200 miles west-southwest of
Anchorage, Alaska. The island is surrounded by the Bering Sea to the
north and the Pacific Ocean to the south.

In 1942, the Adak Army Airfield was established, which gave the United
States Army Air Force a forward base to mount a successful offensive
against the Japanese-held islands of Kiska and Attu during World War II
(WWII). The Adak Army Airfield was subsequently renamed Davis Army
Airfield. Following WWII, Davis Army Airfield was transferred to the
United States Navy and approximately 79,200 acres of the 180,000-acre
island were set aside for Navy use. The Navy conducted multiple
operations at the Adak Naval Air Facility/Naval Air Station through the
1990s. The Former Naval Air Facility was listed under the Base
Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Program in July 1995. The military
mission at Adak ended on March 31, 1997.

The former base had two areas with extensive development. The first was
the \"downtown\" area, where the NAF was located. This area included an
airfield, port facilities, landfills, sewage treatment facilities, light
industrial, administration, commercial, recreational, and residential
areas. The second main area was formerly used by the Naval Security
Group Activity (NSGA) on the northern part of the island.

In September 2000, following the base closure, an agreement was signed
by the Navy, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and The Aleut
Corporation (TAC), which allowed the United States, acting by and
through the Department of Interior (DOI) and the Department of the Navy,
to enter into a land exchange agreement with TAC. The exchange took
place in March 2004, with TAC receiving 47,271 acres of the northern
portion of Adak, including the downtown area, port facilities, utilities
infrastructure and light industrial, administration, commercial,
recreation and residential areas. TAC exchanged surface and subsurface
property from their Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)
entitlement lands, mostly in the Shumagin Islands. Under the terms of
the land transfer agreement, the Adak airfield was transferred to the
Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (ADOT&PG) for
operation and maintenance. The associated land transfer agreement
defines the limits of future environmental liability, set by both DEC
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

**[Contaminated Sites]{.underline}**

[Through military operations over the years, [releases of hazardous
chemicals have occurred via spills,]{.mark} [leaks, and]{.mark}
historical [disposal practices.]{.mark} The [Navy]{.mark} has
[identified **numerous sites with contamination**]{.mark} from past Air
Facility activities.]{.underline} In 1994, [the former [base]{.mark} was
[added to]{.mark} the **[National Priority List]{.mark}** (NPL) of
contaminated sites]{.underline}, under the terms of the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA). Beginning in the 1990s, the Navy, as the responsible party,
has been involved in the environmental restoration, cleanup and closure
activities , following the federal CERCLA standards for protecting
people, animals, and the environment. The EPA provides oversight for
CERCLA and munitions sites. The DEC Contaminated Sites Program oversees
the cleanup to ensure that it meets the State of Alaska standards for
protection of human health and the environment. The Navy, DEC and EPA
seek community involvement via a Restoration Advisory Board (RAB), run
by the Navy. RAB meetings are typically held in April and October.

In 1998, for technical and administrative purposes Adak was divided into
two operable units (OUs), OU A and OU B,.

Operable Unit A encompasses the entire military reservation with respect
to chemical contamination. [[Cleanup and monitoring]{.mark} of sites
within OU A [is]{.mark} [ongoing]{.mark}. [Contamination]{.mark} has
been [identified in soil, surface water, sediment]{.mark}, and as free
phase or dissolved contaminants in the groundwater. [Sources of
contamination include fuel tanks]{.mark} and [lines]{.mark}, drum
[disposal]{.mark} areas, [spill sites, pits]{.mark} for waste oil
disposal/firefighting training, [and landfills.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Surface waters in the area are used for sport, subsistence, and
commercial fishing. [**[Investigations considered]{.mark} the
[possibility of personnel being]{.mark} [exposed to contaminants]{.mark}
through the skin or accidental ingestion of contaminated soil or
water**. Exposure was also considered through **[ingestion of fish or
shellfish]{.mark}** that may have been affected by the site. Threatened
ecological resources included migratory birds, wetlands, spawning and
feeding fish, and various marine mammals.]{.underline}

Operable Unit B encompasses the entire military reservation with respect
to ordnance contamination. Use of live ordnance on Adak was primarily
limited to training ranges and their associated impact areas during the
WWII era. Residual munitions contamination is associated with munitions
storage, handling, and training. Operable Unit B includes two subunits,
OU B-1 and OU B-2. The sites in OU B-1 include the downtown and remote
exchange areas identified for transfer out of Navy control. OU B-2
includes areas in Parcel 4 that were retained by the U.S. Navy pending
additional cleanup. As of 2022, the Navy was still completing munitions
cleanup work in Parcel 4.

Institutional Controls

Institutional Controls are measures to prevent or limit exposure to
hazardous substances left at a site and are an important part of the
cleanup on Adak Island. **[[Total cleanup of all]{.mark} [hazardous
substances is costly and at times impossible.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[Institutional controls]{.mark} on Adak Island [include]{.mark} land
use [restrictions]{.mark}, fish [advisories]{.mark}, excavation
[restrictions, and prohibition of groundwater use.]{.mark} Any
excavation at any depth requires a dig permit from the
Navy.]{.underline} Engineering controls such as fences, signs, and
landfill caps are present throughout the island. Land use controls and
an education program have been implemented to help educate residents and
visitors about fish advisories, basic characteristics of unexploded
ordnance (UXO) items, and procedures to follow if a suspected UXO item
is encountered.

This means that the [U.S. Navy]{.underline} conducts
[[**FONOP**s]{.underline}]{.mark} [more frequently against **some
countries** than others.]{.underline} Most notably, it has [**[never
conducted]{.mark}** formal **F**reedom **o**f **N**avigation
**op**erations [against]{.mark} **Australia or
[Canada]{.mark}**]{.underline}, despite objecting to a number of their
"excessive" claims. 

For example, Washington rejects Australia\'s historic bay claims in
Anxious Bay, Encounter Bay, Lacepede Bay, and Rivoli Bay. It also
objects to the practice of mainland states drawing straight baselines
around offshore island groups, such as those drawn by Australia around
the Abrolhos Islands. (For unclear reasons, however, it does not appear
the United States has formally protested the Abrolhos baselines.) It
likewise objects to Canada\'s straight baselines around the Arctic
Archipelago and treatment of the waters therein --- a.k.a. the Northwest
Passage --- as internal waters. 

In neither case has it challenged these claims with military FONOPs. In
the case of Canada, Washington instead struck a private deal with the
Canadian government to permit the passage of its Navy submarines within
the waters of the archipelago in order to manage the dispute.

In contrast, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has [conducted]{.mark} FONOPs [against most]{.mark} other countries in
the Indian and Pacific oceans]{.underline} that make what it deems to be
"excessive" maritime claims --- a group that [includes virtually **all
[coastal Asian countries]{.mark}**, including [Japan]{.mark},
[So]{.mark}]{.underline}uth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea,
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea, [[China]{.mark}, Taiwan, the
Philippines,]{.underline} Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand, Myanmar, [India, Pakistan]{.underline}, Bangladesh, and Sri
Lanka. 

Using [unilateral military operations to [accuse Asian countries of
violating the l]{.mark}aw [o]{.mark}f the [s]{.mark}ea]{.underline} ---
[[when the U.S. has not even **ratified**]{.mark} the most relevant
international legal convention]{.underline}, the [U.N.
C]{.underline}onvention on the [[L]{.underline}]{.mark}aw
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f the [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea --- is probably
[**[not the best way to win friends]{.mark}** and influence]{.underline}
people in Asia. This is especially true when there is at least the
appearance of a double standard when it comes to the U.S. pursuing
diplomacy instead of military FONOPs against the "excessive" claims of
white-European-descended governments in Canberra and Ottawa.

Instead of using military operations to try to impose its version of the
so-called "liberal rules-based international order" on a world of mostly
formerly colonized nations, the [United States [should adopt a **less
militarized approach**]{.mark} toward f]{.underline}reedom
[o]{.underline}f [n]{.underline}avigation.

Washington should discontinue operational assertions and rely instead on
the **[[diplomatic protest]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
[consultations track]{.underline} of the Freedom of Navigation Program
to protect its rights to freedom of navigation. 

Indeed, the very fact the United States deems as \"excessive\" the
maritime claims of such a broad swath of states in Asia suggests that
perhaps it would do well to adopt a more compromise-oriented approach
that does not [deliberately disregard the security concerns of [coastal
states]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially non-Western formerly colonized
nations, who have legitimate reason to [**[fear foreign naval]{.mark}**
**[power]{.mark}** given the history of its use in their
subjugation.]{.underline}

The [maritime security concerns of nations in]{.underline} South Asia,
Southeast [Asia]{.underline}, and Northeast Asia that lead them to
restrict foreign military navigation [are not going away]{.underline},
especially as China\'s navy emulates the U.S. Navy in operating more
frequently in other countries\' waters. 

The United States should work together with Asian nations to identify
balanced compromises that can help them to feel more secure, while
enabling the major maritime powers like the United States and China to
navigate their navies in ways that adequately protect their overseas
interests. 

The good news is that non-governmental, [**[Track II efforts]{.mark}**
by the EEZ Group]{.underline} 21, a group convened by the Ocean Policy
Research Institute consisting of experts from several countries ---
Japan, the U.S., China, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Vietnam, Australia, India and Russia --- have already crafted an initial
set of guidelines. As I wrote in a recent report published by the Carter
Center, the U.S. should use these guidelines as the basis for
[[negotiat]{.mark}ing an [inclusive agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} with

Conducting an [[Arctic FONOP]{.mark} is a **[bad

[**Even if** the United States could **redress** those

the FONOP idea]{.underline}. Successfully traversing the Northern Sea
Route could [lead to even more **assertive Russian

likely to resist Russian demands, and [will damage U.S-Canadian
relations by setting a **dangerous precedent** for the contested

United States should promote a longer-term counter-narrative that
emphasizes innocent passage in Arctic waters, watches for (and exploits)
divergent Sino-Russian Arctic priorities, and builds the capabilities
necessary to manage Alaskan waters and support NATO allies in the
Arctic.

The Importance of the Northern Sea Route

The Arctic's climate has not been this hot in 10,000 years and is
warming at an alarming pace, raising the possibility of viable Arctic
shipping routes. The Northern Sea Route, one of three main passages
through Arctic waters, runs along Russia's northern coast from Murmansk
in the west to the Bering Strait in the east. It is usually the first,
and sometimes the only, polar shipping route each summer and the last to
become ice-encumbered each fall. The route makes travel between Europe
and Asia roughly 3,000 miles shorter and 11 days quicker than a southern
transit via the Strait of Malacca and Suez Canal.

Core Russian economic and security interests --- and aspects of national
identity --- are at stake in and around the Northern Sea Route.
Economically, one-fifth of Russia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and
over 30 percent of government revenue comes from the Arctic, according
to some estimates. Much of that is from the Yamal Peninsula's oil and
natural gas fields. Russia also has the potential to raise funds from
Northern Sea Route user fees and tolls. In terms of security, the
Russian Arctic is home to much of Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent
in the form of its Northern Fleet submarines based outside of Murmansk.
Were the United States to attack those submarines, it would most likely
route that attack over the North Pole and across the the route along
Russia's border. One way for Russia to protect their nuclear deterrent,
then, is to limit access to and across the Northern Sea Route. Finally,
the Arctic resonates with Russians' conceptions of self and with the
Putin regime's desire to maintain great power status. As detailed below,
these interests have led Russia to become more assertive in its control
of this route.

There are five choke points along the Northern Sea Route where Russia
could conceivably delay or stop shipping traffic should it so choose.
These are places where the channel flows between two pieces of Russian
territory, if not within their 12-mile territorial waters. Passing
through one or more of these choke points, circled in Figure 1, is
inevitable for users of the route The United States rejects Russian
control and militarization of the Northern Sea Route and seemingly wants
to conduct a FONOP to demonstrate that rejection.

Risks to a U.S. FONOP

The United States has a big problem [if it wants to conduct an Arctic
FONOP]{.underline} --- it [doesn't have the **right [ships]{.mark}** to
do it]{.underline}. The Navy has no ice-capable warships in its
inventory, though it is studying the issue. Though the Coast Guard has
one heavy and one medium icebreaker, neither is available for a FONOP in
this region. The heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star, is dedicated to
resupplying Antarctic research stations for roughly seven months a year.
It is in dry-dock for repairs and refitting during the Northern
Hemisphere's summer, exactly the time when the United States would
conduct a FONOP. The medium icebreaker, the Healy, is used along the
Alaska coast during navigable summer months for search and rescue and to
support Arctic scientific missions.

Most importantly, both ships are old and [could [break down]{.mark}
during a FONOP]{.underline}. In that event, the United States [would
[have to ask Russia for]{.mark} emergency
[assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Alternatively, Washington
could partner with a country that had spare summer icebreaking capacity
--- like Finland or Sweden --- but would have to convince that partner
that the benefits of challenging Russian policy would outweigh the
likely Russian blowback aimed at them. That capability deficit would
leave a U.S. FONOP vulnerable to the highly changeable and potentially
severe Arctic environment.

Compounding the U.S. ends-means mismatch are [[Russian **military
capabilities**]{.mark} along the N]{.underline}orthern [S]{.underline}ea
[R]{.underline}oute. The Russians now require passage users to
request permissions, accept ice-pilots, and provide payoffs before
traveling. Should [transiting vessels]{.underline} violate any of these
stipulations they are [subject to being boarded, inspected, fined,
impounded, and even destroyed]{.underline}.

The Russians say they are well within their rights to regulate the
Northern Sea Route given Articles 21 and 234 of the UN Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Article 21 gives states the ability to
regulate their territorial waters. Russia claims that parts of the route
are within their territorial waters. Article 234 states that countries
with adjacent ice-covered waters can regulate those waters if doing so
will protect the environment. The only restraint on that power is the
"due regard" for navigation, a vague statement that leaves much to
interpretation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently noted,
"We will do everything to ensure that the movement of foreign ships is
in full compliance with the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, that
it is carried out in full compliance with all international legal norms,
and that it is absolutely safe."

Russian military capabilities could [**[threaten or sink U.S.
ships]{.mark}** attempting a FONOP]{.underline}. The [Russians are
deploying anti-ship systems at choke points along the
passage]{.underline} to deter unauthorized users, essentially extending
their anti-access/area denial capabilities east from the Barents Sea
where Russia has long implemented a Bastion defense doctrine to protect
its submarine-based nuclear deterrent. Russia does not have to destroy
violating ships to control Northern Sea Route access, but having the
ability to harm violators makes possible the threat to board or impound
vessels. Possible sea-based targets include large ships that carry bulk
cargo, liquid natural gas tankers, container ships, and icebreaker
escort vessels. The Swedish Defense Research Agency has recently
produced an open-source, technical assessment of Russian A2AD military
systems. Figure 2 displays the threat to shipping from the Russian
Bastion and Bal anti-ship systems at three of the five Northern Sea
Route chokepoints using ranges from the Swedish report, places
where open-source reporting locates these or similar systems.

Russia can also [threaten [aircraft]{.mark} that might protect or
attempt to rescue seized or attacked ships]{.underline} and crew.
Airframes that could conduct rescue operations include transport,
rotary, or refueling aircraft, all relatively large and slow-moving
targets. Figure 3 displays the threat rings for the S-400 (SA-21
Growler) air-defense system at the same three chokepoints using
FOI-derived ranges. The [**[S-400]{.mark}** system armed with the 48N6
and 9M96 interceptors [provide]{.mark}s a wide [defensive
circle]{.mark}]{.underline} against rescue aircraft trying to liberate
an impounded ship and could make attacks against the Bastion or Bal
anti-ship systems difficult. And note that Russian doctrine calls for
the deployment of air defense systems rather than single capabilities.
That means that the S-400s themselves could be protected from attack by
shorter range air defense systems like the Pantsir (SA-22 Greyhound).

The Russians have started to overtly deploy these systems at
chokepoints, according to open source reports. Air defense systems are
being installed that "will fully cover the Arctic air space as a
shield," according to Admiral Nikolay Yevmenov, Russia's Northern Fleet
Commander. Lavrov has said that Arctic bases will "ensure the necessary
defense capability in view of the military-political situation near our
borders." Russia has also conducted weapons tests in the Barents and
Kara seas.

In short, the lack of U.S. capabilities leaves U.S. vessels vulnerable
to changing sea ice conditions. The relative imbalance between American
and Russian capabilities makes a FONOP militarily dangerous.

Risks from a U.S. FONOP

[[Even if]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates were to
**[redress]{.mark} the capabilities [imbalance]{.mark}**]{.underline},
an [Arctic [FONOP]{.mark} is **[still]{.mark} a [bad]{.mark}
idea**]{.underline} because of the risks from such an action. The
[long-run [**implications are dire**]{.mark} should a FONOP
fail]{.underline}, even if it did not lead to a military confrontation.
[[Failure]{.mark} would build perceptions that the United States **can't
compete** in the Arctic and that [**Russia can get away** with
**violating** f]{.mark}]{.underline}reedom [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f
[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}avigation [when challenged.]{.underline} Such
failure could have ripple effects for NATO's posture in the High North,
and for future Russian behavior. The [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}, who
are attempting inroads in the Arctic, could **[[become
emboldened.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

There are potentially [bad **secondary consequences** [even if]{.mark} a
U.S. FONOP **[succeeds]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Russia has core
interests]{.mark} at stake along the N]{.underline}orthern
[S]{.underline}ea [R]{.underline}oute. [The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[does not]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Russia]{.mark} could **[reimpose]{.mark}** Northern Sea Route
[restrictions]{.mark} **immediately after** a U.S. FONOP or [deploy
more]{.mark} extensive Russian [capabilities]{.mark}, making future
FONOPs more difficult]{.underline}. Remember that Russian behavior in
Crimea, eastern Ukraine, and online (with regard to election
interference) continued even in the face of Western sanctions. If
Russian behavior did not change in response to strong sanctions, there
is little reason to think that it will change after a few U.S. ships
sail through the Northern Sea Route.

U.S. officials also should understand that none of this will be done in
isolation. A [successful FONOP]{.underline} has [[implications
for]{.mark} the American and [**Canadian dispute** over]{.mark} the
[Northwest Passage]{.mark}]{.underline}, which Canada claims is an
internal waterway and a core Canadian interest. The [Canadians would
have to wonder if the Americans would feel bound to actively contest
Canada's claim]{.underline}, rather than quietly agreeing to disagree as
has been the case since the 1980s. A Northwest Passage dispute would
[[further strain]{.mark} cross-border relations]{.underline}, with
[implications for bilateral **political, trade, and [security
coop]{.mark}eration.**]{.underline}

Finally, [[shipping companies]{.mark} may **[continue to comply with
Russia]{.mark}n demands** even if a FONOP succeeds]{.underline} [because
the United States cannot maintain a permanent presence in the Northern
Sea Route]{.underline}. Shipping companies are loath to travel routes
unless indemnified from loss, and insurance companies hate risk. Yes,
Russian tolls will inflate shipping costs. Yet [shipping companies will
be [under **significant pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from
**insurance companies**]{.mark} to pay a known toll rather than risk the
much **larger potential cost** of losing a vessel]{.underline} (either
to ice, weather, or the Russians). As a result, shippers will comply
with Russian demands if they want insurance because the costs of user
compliance are lower than the potential costs of noncompliance.

WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - **[The [Trump]{.mark} administration has
[fired U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Linda]{.mark} [Lee
Fagan]{.mark},]{.underline}** the first female uniformed leader of an
armed forces branch, the Department of Homeland Security said on
Tuesday.

Former President Joe Biden nominated Fagan to lead the Coast Guard,
which is responsible for maritime security, in 2021. [She became the
first female uniformed leader of a branch of the U.S. Armed
Forces.]{.underline}

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamin Huffman, in a message posted
on the Coast Guard\'s website, confirmed Fagan had been relieved of her
duties after a \"long and illustrious career.\"

Huffman had terminated Fagan from her position because of \"leadership
deficiencies, operational failures, and inability to advance the
strategic objectives of the U.S. Coast Guard,\" a senior Department of
Homeland Security official said.

[[One of the reasons]{.mark}, the official said while speaking on the
condition of anonymity, [was]{.mark} Fagan\'s **\"excessive\" [focus
on]{.mark} Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ([DEI]{.mark})
policies.**]{.underline}

Fagan and the Coast Guard could not be immediately reached for comment.

[Trump has vowed to eliminate DEI programs in federal government
agencies. The goal of the programs had been to increase diversity
throughout the armed forces to **better reflect the American
population** they serve to protect.]{.underline}

The Coast Guard, in particular, has faced scrutiny in the past for
sexual assault complaints but also allegations of racism and hazing.

While the Coast Guard is an armed service, it falls under the Department
of Homeland Security, not the Pentagon.

Democratic Congressman Rick Larsen said [[the decision to remove Fagan
was **\"misguided and will hurt readiness.\"**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[\"The women and men of the U.S. [Coast Guard deserve better than
**reckless personnel decisions**]{.mark},\" Larsen said.]{.underline}

[The Coast Guard has been under scrutiny for sexual assault]{.underline}
since a media report alleged it covered up decades of abuse and a Senate
subcommittee found it shamed victims and failed to deal with
perpetrators.

More than a dozen former U.S. Coast Guard Academy students who say they
were victims of sexual assault filed complaints last year seeking \$130
million in damages, accusing the school of allowing sexual violence to
go unchecked.

Trump adviser Elon Musk, who leads the new administration\'s effort to
cut costs across the federal government, alluded to efforts to promote
diversity, equity and inclusion in a social media post, but did not
explicitly confirm Fagan\'s termination.

\"Undermining the U.S. military and border security to spend money on
racist/sexist DEI nonsense is no longer acceptable,\" Musk, the world\'s
richest man, wrote on X.

WashingtonCNN --- 

[As monstrous floodwaters surged across central Texas late last week,
officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency leapt into action,
preparing to deploy critical search and rescue teams and life-saving
resources, like they have in countless past disasters.]{.underline}

[But almost instantly, FEMA ran into bureaucratic obstacles, four
officials inside the agency told CNN.]{.underline}

[As ]{.underline}[CNN has previously
reported](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/politics/kristi-noem-fema-dhs-funding)[,
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem --- whose department oversees
FEMA --- recently enacted a sweeping rule aimed at cutting spending:
Every contract and grant over \$100,000 now requires her personal
sign-off before any funds can be released.]{.underline}

For FEMA, where disaster response costs routinely soar into the billions
as the agency contracts with on-the-ground crews, officials say that
threshold is essentially "pennies," requiring sign-off for relatively
small expenditures.

In essence, they say the order has stripped the agency of much of its
autonomy at the very moment its help is needed most.

["We were operating under a clear set of guidance: lean forward, be
prepared, anticipate what the state needs, and be ready to deliver it,"
a longtime FEMA official told CNN. "That is not as clear of an intent
for us at the moment."]{.underline}

[For example, as central Texas towns were submerged in rising waters,
FEMA officials realized they couldn't pre-position Urban Search and
Rescue crews from a network of teams stationed regionally across the
country.]{.underline}

#### East Asian proliferation causes a wider proliferation cascade, causes preemptive strikes, and goes nuclear

**Fitzpatrick 23**

Mark Fitzpatrick (Mark Fitzpatrick is an Associate Fellow at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies and a former U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, ), 3-31-2023, \"The
Unacceptable Costs of ROK Nuclearization and the Need for Congressional
Action\", National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR),
https://www.nbr.org/publication/the-unacceptable-costs-of-rok-nuclearization-and-the-need-for-congressional-action/
jt

For over half a century, [U.S. [presidents]{.mark} from both parties
[have upheld]{.mark} a universal policy of [nuclear
nonproliferation]{.mark}, applied to friend and foe alike]{.underline}.
[[Nonproliferation]{.mark} is a global good]{.underline}, for which
Washington has been the main architect and protector. [It also is in
U.S. national interests, not least because it [helps protect the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [against entanglement in nuclear
conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thanks to U.S. leadership, the nuclear
club has been kept to single digits.

In 1975 the Nixon administration forced the Republic of Korea (ROK) to
end its secret pursuit of nuclear weapons technology, warning President
Park Chung-hee that this pursuit put the alliance at risk. Later that
decade and the next, the United States repeatedly forced Taiwan under
President Chiang Kai-shek to end the development of nuclear weapons.
Throughout the Cold War, whenever Japanese leaders hinted about
considering nuclear weapons, [U.S. counterparts reinforced security
[assurances]{.mark} to [persuade Japan to remain]{.mark} a
[non-nuclear]{.mark} state.]{.underline}

[The [universal nonproliferation]{.mark} policy was [also
successfully]{.mark} applied to [curb nuclear aspirations in Argentina,
Brazil, Iran, Iraq, and Libya]{.mark}]{.underline}. It was unsuccessful,
however, regarding India, Pakistan, and North Korea, though not for lack
of trying. Israel has been the lone exception to U.S. nonproliferation
policy. President John Kennedy tried to halt the Dimona project, which
was based on French technology, but President Richard Nixon agreed with
Prime Minister Golda Meir to look the other way as long as Israel did
not publicly acknowledge its nuclear program.

[Today, a number of [South Koreans are knocking on the nuclear
door]{.mark}---for understandable reasons]{.underline}. [Across the 38th
parallel,]{.underline} [the ROK faces a hostile enemy building up
nuclear and missile arsenals without letup. Across the Yellow Sea,
China, while not as directly threatening, is also increasing its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}.

President Yoon Suk-yeol quickly backed away from his January 11 comment
that his country would consider building nuclear weapons of its own or
ask the United States to redeploy them on the Korean Peninsula if North
Korea's nuclear threat continued to grow. The impulse remains strong,
however. [A whopping 70% of South Koreans say in opinion polls that they
want a nuclear equalizer. A main motivation is a desire for "agency" in
their own national security, especially to negotiate with North Korea on
equal footing]{.underline}. Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon added fuel to the
nuclear push in a Reuters interview on March 13.

In mapping its policy, the ROK should weigh the supposed benefits of
going nuclear against the economic, political, and security costs of
breaking out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and other]{.mark} supplier[s]{.mark}
[would be bound]{.mark} by law [to stop]{.mark} providing the uranium
fuel for the country's 25 nuclear power plants and [the cooperation that
enables South Korea to be a major nuclear technology exporter]{.mark}.
Laws in the United States, Japan, and Europe would also affect defense
sales, loans, and credit guarantees. China could be expected to apply
sanctions that are more biting. **[North Korea might]{.mark} even be
tempted to [launch preemptive strikes during the vulnerable]{.mark} two
[years]{.mark} or so that it would take the ROK to realize a nuclear
capability. [And South Korean nuclearization is the likeliest trigger
for Japan to seek]{.mark} its own [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

These would also be serious costs to the United States. [[With the NPT
in tatters]{.mark}, other nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey,
would be more inclined to follow the ROK in pursuing nuclear weapons.
While a [proliferation cascade]{.mark} is not preordained, the [risk
would heighten]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[More nuclear]{.mark}-armed
[states]{.mark} would [mean more danger of]{.mark} nuclear [use and
fewer ways]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}for the United States [[to
exercise control]{.mark}. Additionally, a South Korean decision to go
nuclear would be tantamount to an expression of nonconfidence in the
U.S. security guarantee, thereby damaging the United States' standing
with allies and adversaries alike.]{.underline} Credibility rests on
perceptions, which a ROK nuclear program would seriously undermine.

#### Japanese prolif would be disastrous -- massively increases the risk of accidental war and risks drawing in China and Russia

**Mizokami 21**

Kyle Mizokami (Kyle Mizokami is a defense and national security writer
based in San Francisco who has appeared in The Diplomat, Foreign Policy,

Could Quickly Build Nuclear Weapons in a Crisis\", National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/surprise-japan-could-quickly-build-nuclear-weapons-crisis-190089
jt

Land-based missiles:

[[Japan could invest in]{.mark} a small arsenal of [land-based
missiles]{.mark}, each carrying one or more nuclear
warheads]{.underline}. The missiles could be stationed in hardened
silos, like the American Minuteman III, or on mobile launchers like the
Russian RS-24 Yars. A Japanese ICBM would be smaller, not needing the
range and fuel to reach North America. The ability to reach all of
China, European Russia and the Middle East would be sufficient.

[Eventually, Japan might settle on a force of 100 intermediate-range
ballistic missiles, each equipped with three 100 kiloton
warheads]{.underline}. The missiles could be based in hardened silos in
eastern Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, or moved around on mobile
launchers.

This is the least survivable of the three ideas. [[Japan's close
proximity to China]{.mark} means that in the event of a nuclear attack
from the latter it would need to have a "launch on warning" doctrine to
ensure the missiles survived. That [would considerably increase the
possibility of accidental nuclear war, as a]{.mark} hardware or software
[malfunction in Japan's early warning system could be]{.mark}
incorrectly [interpreted as an attack]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Geography makes land basing even less attractive. Japan's high
population density makes it impossible to find a location for 100
missile silos that would not would invite terrible collateral damage in
the event of attack. Even basing them in remote places like the northern
Island of Hokkaido would incur needless risk. Mobile launchers would be
far too large and heavy to travel Japan's road network, unless a
separate track were built somewhere. Even that would make their
positioning more predictable.

Another option might be to exploit Japan's extensive rail network.

Strategic bombers:

[Japan could build a wing of stealthy bombers to deliver cruise missiles
and nuclear gravity bombs]{.underline}. Such an aircraft could fly
nuclear penetration missions against adversaries, knocking out enemy
nuclear weapons, command and control and other counterforce targets.
Nuclear bombers would give Japanese strategic warfare planners the
flexibility to go after multiple targets or change the targets in
mid-flight. Nuclear bombers can be recalled at any point in the mission.

A bomber scheme could involve three squadrons of twenty-four bombers
each, for a total of seventy-two jets, each the size of an FB-111 strike
aircraft. Each bomber would carry four short-range attack missiles, each
with a 100 kiloton yield, for a total of 288 nuclear weapons.

Geography also makes strategic bombers unlikely. [A lightning attack
against Japan's bomber bases could wipe out the entire force on the
ground before they are given the order to scramble]{.underline}. If
tankers are necessary for the bombers to reach their targets, the
destruction of the Japanese tanker force would make the bombers
irrelevant. Furthermore, advances in air defense technology could make
the bombers dangerously vulnerable.

Japan could, like the U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command of old,
maintain a force of bombers permanently in the air, but that would be
expensive and require enough bombers in the air (and aerial tankers) at
any one time inflict a punishing blow. The cost and complexity of
standing up and maintaining such a force would be prohibitive.

Ballistic Missile Submarines:

This is the most attractive option. [[Ballistic missile submarines are
the most survivable]{.mark} platform---as long as at least one were out
on patrol at all times.]{.underline} Each Japanese "boomer" could just
sail east to the Mid-Pacific to relative safety; any anti-submarine
warfare ships and planes sent by Russia or China to hunt it would have
to get past Japan itself.

Japan could persuade the United States to share submarine, missile and
warhead technology with it the way it does with the United Kingdom. Of
the three basing schemes, the defensive nature of sea-based deterrent is
probably the most likely the United States would agree to help with.
Depending on the timeline, Japan could even end up funding certain parts
of the Ohio Replacement Program---particularly the missile.

[In a sea-basing scheme Japan could emulate China, France or the United
Kingdom, maintaining a force of five ballistic missile submarines, each
equipped with sixteen nuclear-tipped missiles]{.underline}. Each missile
would be equipped with four 100 kiloton warheads. The one submarine on
patrol at all times would be equipped with sixty-four warheads.

There are some drawbacks. [Ballistic missile [submarines would be more
difficult to keep in contact with during a crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Finally, if only two out of five submarines are on patrol at any time
only 128 warheads would be available.

Obviously, under current circumstances, [it's not in anyone's interests
for Japan to have nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Still, it must be
recognized that if pushed, it could certainly do so. Although a long
ways off, **[all sides should remember that [increasingly strained
relations between Japan, China, and Russia could make a bad
situation]{.mark} much, much [worse]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Japan is [incapable]{.underline} of deploying a nuke, and [domestic politics]{.underline}, [multilateral agreements]{.underline} and [testing hurdles]{.underline} check. Conventional capabilities are [sufficient]{.underline}.

Indeed, what happened to Ukraine came as a shock, not only to Japan, but
also to other countries, particularly those dependent on others to meet
their security needs. Abe is also aware of the Japanese public's
concerns about the ongoing North Korea threat and China's increasing
aggression in East Asia and the South China Sea region. Of course, Japan
has all the capabilities to be a nuclear power and already is in
possession of 45.5 tonnes of reparated Plutonium, enough to produce
6,000 nuclear bombs. [Japan could go nuclear within six to 12 months;
nevertheless, **[Japan will not acquire]{.mark} nuclear weapons** for
several reasons]{.underline}. First, as is well known, [Japan is the
only country to have suffered from nuclear attacks]{.underline}. This
was the main reason for its surrender in the Second World War. After the
war, Japan adopted the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, which stipulate
non-possession, non-production, and non-introduction of nuclear weapons
in its territories. [Japan is [still politically firmly stuck to]{.mark}
these principles in accordance with [its]{.mark} Peace
[Constitution]{.mark}]{.underline}. Former prime minister, Yoshihide
Suga, vowed not only to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,
but also to free the world of all nuclear arms. This [Japanese
sensitivity to nuclear technology was further reinforced after the
Fukushima disaster in 2011.]{.underline} Second, [The anti-nuclear
sentiment is strong among Japanese people]{.underline}. Indeed, the
Japanese are strikingly opposed to nuclear weapons. According to a
prevous public opinion poll, [[82 per cent of]{.mark} Japanese
[people]{.mark} are [against nuclear weapons]{.mark}, while 69 per cent
are also opposed to having these weapons brought into their country\'s
territories]{.underline}. Third, it is not only the Japanese public that
is opposed to nuclear weapons. Indeed, [there [many **internal
players**]{.mark} who [reject]{.mark} these [nuclear
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [nuclear energy industry]{.mark} in
Japan is advanced and thriving, but this [only gained acceptance on
account]{.mark} of the \'nuclear [energy, not]{.mark} nuclear [weapons\'
deal]{.mark} of the 1950s.]{.underline} Thus **[[ministries]{.mark},
[regulatory bodies]{.mark}, [industrial groups]{.mark}, and [local
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[have]{.mark} the [right of
veto]{.mark} against any political decision in this regard.]{.underline}
These [entities **[rely on strong public
opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [of course.]{.underline} Another
important point here is that the [nuclear [facilities]{.mark} in Japan
operate [in compliance with]{.mark} several [multilateral
agreements]{.mark} and treaties]{.underline}. It is also noteworthy that
[[all Japanese]{.mark} nuclear [activities]{.mark} are [under]{.mark}
the regulatory [control of]{.mark} the [I]{.mark}nternational
[A]{.mark}tomic [E]{.mark}nergy [A]{.mark}gency]{.underline}. Forth,
Japan is still, and will remain, under the American nuclear umbrella.
All American administrations, including Trump\'s, have reaffirmed their
commitment to Japan\'s security. Therefore, [[US nuclear
capacities]{.mark} together [with]{.mark} its [conventional]{.mark}
military [capabilities]{.mark} in the region [are sufficient]{.mark} to
deter any North Korean security threat to Japan]{.underline}, including
a nuclear attack. However, US withdrawal from the Pacific, though not
yet expected, could invoke Japan to conclude that the \"nuclear option\"
might be the best choice. Indeed, if [the US withdraws its security
commitment to Japan]{.underline}, which includes the nuclear umbrella,
[Japan could seriously consider becoming a nuclear power. But this is
not expected, at least not in the near future.]{.underline} Fifth,
[despite [Japan]{.mark}\'s potential to develop a nuclear capacity, it
still [faces **significant challenges** in]{.mark} the
[acquisition]{.mark} of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The [issue is not
limited to making an atomic bomb. [Developing]{.mark} a nuclear
[deterrent]{.mark} will be **[no easy matter]{.mark}** for Japan. It
will [need to conduct]{.mark} a **[series of]{.mark} nuclear
[tests]{.mark}**, [over]{.mark} a [period of years]{.mark}, to achieve
reliable nuclear capabilities.]{.underline} This also raises another
significant question: [**How will Japan deploy** such
weapons]{.underline}? [[Japan]{.underline} **[does not have
nuclear-capable aircraft]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, [nor]{.mark} does it
have specialised [bombers]{.mark} or strike planes]{.underline}. The
Japan Air Self-Defence Force does have several [[US
warplanes]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the F-15, which can be modified
to carry nuclear bombs. However, deploying these [[would require US
approval]{.mark} to access the \"black boxes\" on the plane, that is the
electronic codes. It is [hard to imagine]{.mark} that the US would
consent to this. [Despite]{.mark} the ongoing
[debates]{.mark}]{.underline} as to whether Japan should change its
long-standing policy of nuclear abstention, [given the profound changes
in the regional and international security environment, **it is [not
expected]{.mark} that [Japan will opt for
nuclearisation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at least not [in the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. However, the debate on sharing nuclear power with
the US will remain active from some time.

#### Even in the [worst-case scenario]{.underline}, Japan will only increase [conventional]{.underline} capabilities.

"Understanding Japan's Nuclear Dilemma." 1/18/23.
https://www.apln.network/news/member_activities/understanding-japans-nuclear-dilemma

In the wake of these palpable security threats, it is not surprising
that Japan's NDS 2022 has acknowledged that "Japan must: fundamentally
reinforce defense capability with a focus on opponents' capabilities and
the ways they prosecute warfare; and actively adapt to new ways of
warfare." Accordingly, the DBP has decided to hike defence spending from
1 per cent to 2 per cent of Japan's GDP by 2027, making it Japan's
largest military spending since World War II. Secondly, [[Japan]{.mark}
has also [outlined plans to acquire 'counterstrike
capability']{.mark}]{.underline} through long-range land and
sea-launched missiles. In the past, Tokyo preferred relying on missile
defence. But now, [it appears ready to accept counterstrike as a way [to
thwart enemy attacks]{.mark} rather than just defending
itself]{.underline}. Finally, of course, the NDS clarifies that
"counterstrike capabilities fall within the purview of Japan's
Constitution and international law; they do not change Japan's
exclusively defense-oriented policy." [**[None of the]{.mark} three
[documents]{.mark}** [mention]{.mark}s [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Japan continues to maintain the
centrality of the 'Three Non-Nuclear principles,']{.underline} adopted
by the National Diet in 1971. These include a commitment to "not
possess, not produce, and not permit the introduction of nuclear
weapons." However, discussion on nuclear sharing a la NATO has surfaced
amongst the Japanese strategic community of scholars and retired
practitioners. Soon after the Russian military action against Ukraine,
the former PM of Japan, late Shinzo Abe, also from the same political
party as the current PM, had hinted at a reappraisal of security
strategies by the NNWS, including Japan. He had called upon Tokyo to
cast off taboos around its possession of nuclear weapons and consider
hosting them as NATO members do in Europe. For now, though, [Japan does
not seem to be ready to accept this advice]{.underline}. Rather, [it
appears to be basing its defence strategy on three planks]{.underline}.
One, it is significantly enhancing its conventional forces. Secondly, it
is seeking reinforcement of the US commitment to keep nuclear weapons as
a core component of their alliance. So, Japan is supportive of the US
first-use strategy and its deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons to
deter regional contingencies. Thirdly, [Japan is looking for **universal
nuclear disarmament** to strip its adversaries of their nuclear weapons
and thus ease its security concerns in the long term]{.underline}. Is
there a dichotomy amongst these three efforts? Are the first two in
conflict with the last one? Not necessarily, when seen through the lens
of [Japan's increasingly hostile threat environment]{.underline}. This
[is forcing [Tokyo]{.mark} to [balance]{.mark} a [pacifist constitution
and]{.mark} a [desire for]{.mark} eventual [nuclear disarmament
with]{.mark} the compulsion of [military
enhancements]{.mark}]{.underline}, including through US affirmations of
an "unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan, including... by the
full range of conventional and nuclear capabilities." It may be recalled
that India, too, faced a somewhat similar dilemma in the 1980s and 1990s
when it was faced with threats from two nuclear-armed nations, China and
Pakistan. Without the protection of a nuclear umbrella of any NWS, India
too had then campaigned for prioritising nuclear disarmament. PM Rajiv
Gandhi presented an action plan to the third special session on
disarmament in 1988. However, Cold War politics killed the initiative.
Thereafter, the unconditional and indefinite extension of the NPT in
1995 made India realise that the non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) had
lost any leverage on the NWS to push them towards giving up their
nuclear weapons. The belief was strengthened when the CTBT, in 1996,
accepted the rights of the NWS to undertake non-explosive nuclear tests
to hone their nuclear arsenals while binding others to a ban on nuclear
testing. All these developments shattered New Delhi's hopes for
universal nuclear disarmament. Acquisition of nuclear weapons became a
necessity to safeguard against the threat of nuclear blackmail and
coercion from nuclear-armed neighbours who lay claim to Indian
territories. But, even as a nuclear possessor, India has continued to
campaign for a nuclear-weapon-free world (NWFW). There is no
contradiction in this position. Nuclear weapons remain a short-term
compulsion owing to immediate security threats, but an NWFW is a
long-term aspiration to remove nuclear risks and ease the security
environment. Today, [Japan]{.underline}, too, [is looking for its
security [by fortifying]{.mark} all possible routes: [conventional
modernisation, strengthening alliances]{.mark}]{.underline} (with the US
and others, such as the Quad), [[and]{.mark} searching for universal
[nuclear disarmament]{.mark}.]{.underline} Each one of them is being
built as a bulwark [[to **keep the country from having to amend its
policy** of nuclear 'no']{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [crossing that
bridge will not be easy, given that 75 per cent of the Japanese public
supports nuclear disarmament.]{.underline} It is, therefore, not
surprising that PM Kishida has chosen to give disarmament another chance
in the face of the deteriorating regional and global nuclear threat
environment. As he has said, "giving up is not an option".

Washington --- The **[[House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of
legislation to regulate crypto]{.mark}currency after its fate appeared
in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the
floor to a standstill.]{.underline}**

[The bill, known as the [GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto
legislation ever passed by Congress.]{.mark} It now heads to President
Trump\'s desk.]{.underline}

[It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and
102 Democrats supporting it.]{.underline}

On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance
three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a
regulatory framework for the \$250 billion market for stablecoins, a
type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S.
dollar.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled
the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to
meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to
fall in line.

But drama unfolded during Wednesday\'s procedural vote when a few
holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their
opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up
debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the
holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with
legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.

Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative
House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to
package the two digital asset measures.

The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and
upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"

House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married
with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a
digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the
crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and
slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the
GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader
in digital assets.

This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the
controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act,
which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank
digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate\'s stablecoin bill and
the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it
would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.

\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said
Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.

A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to tie the ban on a central
bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization
bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative
process to move on.

The Senate approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after
experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about
the Trump family\'s business ventures involving crypto and the potential
that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.

The Trump family\'s crypto investments have increased their wealth by
billions of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to
loosen the federal government\'s regulatory approach to the digital
currency industry as a whole. The White House has denied that there are
any conflicts of interest and said Mr. Trump\'s assets are in a trust
managed by his children.

Democratic critics were also worried that the legislation did not
contain strong enough provisions to protect consumers, the financial
system and national security.

It\'s faced similar criticism from House Democrats.

\"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress
is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence,\"
Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House
Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.

Democrats who back the legislation have argued that regulations are long
overdue, even if the measure is imperfect.

\"The question is, do you want some rules of the road or no rules of the
road?\" Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said during floor
debate.

**[The broader market structure bill also passed with bipartisan support
and now heads to the Senate. The legislation banning a central bank
digital currency was approved largely along party lines.]{.underline}**

[The space technology company [SpinLaunch]{.mark} has [signed a
**100-year land lease** with the Aleut Corp]{.mark}., the landowning
Native corporation on Adak, [where it plans to build a launchpad to send
satellites into low Earth orbit.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The agreement was finalized in October 2024 and announced Thursday in a
statement from the Aleut Corp.

Aleut Corp. spokesperson Kate Gilling said in an interview that the
corporation has been in talks with the California-based space start-up
for several years.

"Finally to be at the point where we can announce and share it is very
exciting," Gilling said.

[[SpinLaunch plans to use Adak as a site for its **centrifugal launch
technology**]{.mark}, which the company calls a mass acceleration
system. It [spins payloads in a vacuum chamber at high speeds and hurls
them into orbit without relying on fuel-powered
rockets.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Aleut Corp. Vice President of Regional Affairs Julie Toomey describes it
"like a high tech slingshot."

**[["It\'s cleaner, simpler and]{.mark} significantly more cost
effective," she said.]{.underline}**

SpinLaunch first drew attention in 2018 for proposing the method as a
lower-cost alternative to conventional rocket launches. The company has
since completed about 10 test flights using a scaled-down version of the
system at Spaceport America in New Mexico.

[In recent years **it explored locations for a permanent launch site**,
which included a 2020 visit to Unalaska. But that did not advance past
early discussions.]{.underline}

[Adak is the westernmost municipality in the United States and was once
the home of a naval air base. [SpinLaunch]{.mark} said in its Thursday
statement that it [chose Adak for the island's]{.mark} combination of
**[remoteness]{.mark}** [and **existing infrastructure**]{.mark}. The
island has a [deepwater port, regular commercial air service and
**existing military facilities**]{.mark} from the naval base, which
closed in 1997.]{.underline}

SpinLaunch also pointed to Adak's **[[potential for renewable energy
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including wind and geothermal
resources.

The island's population shrank rapidly when the base was decommissioned,
falling from over 4,000 residents in the 1990s to fewer than 50 people
today. The city closed its school last year due to shrinking enrollment.

Toomey said the existing infrastructure, much of it originating during
the military's buildup in the 1940s, attracted SpinLaunch to Adak.

**["There's operational airport and port infrastructure, former military
buildings we can repurpose, and renewable energy potential to help power
the site," she said.]{.underline}**

Gilling, with Aleut Corp., said she thinks the project will spur growth
and attract families back to the island.

"That will certainly mean an increase in population," she said. "We\'ll
need more restaurants. We\'ll need more hoteling and housing space.
We\'ll need more infrastructure. So that influx of a larger population
will only bring about benefits for the community."

Adak does not have a village corporation and is instead under the
umbrella of the regional corporation.

Aleut Corp. Board Chair Jenifer Nelson said the project will benefit the
corporation's more than 5,000 shareholders in addition to Adak's
community members.

"We are working to drive meaningful economic development that brings
long-term benefits to our shareholders and the region as a whole,"
Nelson said.

[U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has been outspoken in his support for Adak's
development, and Aleut Corp. representatives say he backs the
project.]{.underline}

Environmental planning is ongoing, and the Aleut Corp. said it's paying
special attention to nesting bird habitats.

A timeline for launch operations has not been announced.

#### US development of satellite broadband checks [Chinese space dominance]{.underline}.

Over the last five years, the security implications of [[China's **5G
prolif**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline} have [[received]{.mark} a
**steady amount of [attention]{.mark}**. [But]{.mark}]{.underline} there
is a lesser-discussed, increasingly important side of technological
competition between the US and China: [[Beijing's]{.mark} **growing
[involvement]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark} **many [other]{.mark} critical
components and [tech]{.mark}nologies** [that power]{.mark} the
**[future]{.mark} of [global telecom]{.mark}munications**]{.underline},
from the depths of the oceans to outer space.

[Advanced [tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} that [[will **ride** on top
of **5G** ]{.mark}**networks**]{.underline} --- such as [[**robotics**,
**drones**]{.underline}]{.mark}, autonomous vehicles, augmented
reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} video
[[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} cameras --- could prove vulnerable.
But so too can backhaul, subsea cables, mobile applications, and mobile
devices that all contribute to the global telecommunications network.
[China]{.underline} has [increased **state investment**]{.underline} in
these areas, [with an eye on **controlling** the networks that data is
transported on and]{.underline}, potentially, [access that critical
data]{.underline}.

[China is approaching these with the]{.underline} same
[stance]{.underline} they have taken towards 5G --- [that **domination**
is needed **across the board**. And unlike America, where the **various
communications technology sectors**]{.underline} tend to [run **parallel
but separate**, China [is seeking to]{.mark}]{.underline} i**[[ntertwine
everything]{.underline}]{.mark}**, an important strategy that could give
them a leg up on the US unless Washington can switch its thinking and
take countering actions.

The good news: [it's not too late to take action, and [in **one crucial
domain**, the US **still has dominance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
previously disassociated technologies begin to overlap,
[[5G]{.underline}]{.mark} applications [[through]{.mark} the
[space]{.mark} domain will be the **connective tissue**. [Washington
must **prepare** for this new frontier]{.mark} of **technological
[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} by taking several steps to change
the current thinking.

Washington should adapt a deliberate global mindset in addressing
Chinese maritime and telecom practices that are outside of established
global norms of behavior. Rather than approaching China's challenge in a
segmented approach by region or by industry, a holistic effort is needed
--- a global view across the government, in close cooperation with
industry and teaming with nations across the globe. While countries are
now moving to compete with China's use of economic power --- think the
United States' Build Back Better World, the European Union's Global
Gateway and the Quad's technology initiatives --- more must be done.
Organizations such as the Import-Export Bank and the US Development
Finance Corporation can be integrated into business opportunities to
provide viable alternatives to China's artificially low pricing in
developing countries. On the security side, the upcoming National
Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy should avoid a
stove-piped focus on defense and instead emphasize enhancing the
competitive advantage of the free market society.

In establishing a global maritime strategy, the United States should
expand investment in 5G and automation at ports to remain competitive,
limit future supply chain disruptions, and capture the benefits of the
trend of larger port utilization. This includes promoting and protecting
innovation of the advanced technologies that will be enhanced by 5G
networks, such as in the use of robotics, drones, and autonomous
vehicles. These fields will have a transformational impact on
productivity and the economy, while establishing innovative capabilities
that can be a basis for US companies to have a lasting global impact.

[[In developing a **global**]{.underline}]{.mark} Information,
Communications and Technology (**[[ICT]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[**[strategy]{.mark}**, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[[should **support**]{.mark} the growth of **[space-based

capabilities [enabled by]{.mark} **growing [constellations]{.mark}** [of
sat]{.mark}ellite[s in space is the **next frontier**]{.mark} of
national investment and strategic focus]{.underline}. As a growing
number of broadband providers, led by SpaceX and their Starlink
constellation, increase the number of broadband and 5G capable
satellites (including China) in space, more data will flow in, from, and
through space.

[**Emerging [satellite broadband networks]{.mark}** [can be an
**alternative**]{.mark}]{.underline} route [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
market into [[developing countries with]{.mark} **already established
[Chinese]{.mark} terrestrial [infrastructure]{.mark}**[. By]{.mark}

[control]{.mark}** of]{.underline} a nation's **[communication
networks]{.underline}**. Access to credible and free flowing information
will counter concerns over untrustworthy networks.

Every strength can also be a weakness. China's "strength" of
authoritarian control has given them an ability to manage globally
according to an all-of-government and state-owned-industry strategy.
However, this approach has diminished trust externally and has stifled
innovation internally. The United States needs to enhance its global
mindset to foster its strengths of its innate innovative spirit as well
as the breadth of relationships across industry and with allies and
partners to gain back momentum across the world's transportation and
communication networks.

[[This is]{.mark} the **[critical]{.mark} battleground** [for]{.mark}

**Kwast '19** \[Steve; August 19; M.A. in Public Policy from Harvard
John F. Kennedy School of Government; War On the Rocks, "THE REAL STAKES
IN THE NEW SPACE RACE,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/08/the-real-stakes-in-the-new-space-race/\]

[Why is **[space]{.mark}** so [**critical** to the future]{.mark}? Space
is powerful precisely because it benefits from the attributes and
principles of a network. A network can deliver power, information, and
goods from one node, or all nodes, at a fraction of the increase in cost
per customer compared to a linear system]{.underline}. The post office
is an example of a linear model. If you send a letter to 100 different
people, you have to pay for 100 stamps. The Internet is an example of a
networked model. If you want to send an email to 100 people you can send
it at a fraction of the cost. Most of our terrestrial economies are
modeled on linear design, driving up cost for every delivery to a new
customer. [A networked space infrastructure will always win the cost war
against a linear terrestrial infrastructure. Consequently, the first
civilization to build a robust networked space infrastructure will
dominate the global economy of the 21st century]{.underline}.

[Space will be a multi-trillion-dollar market that will
disproportionately benefit the first great power that builds a vibrant
infrastructure there. [Finishing second]{.mark} in this race
[means]{.mark} accepting **[defeat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Why is this
the case? Whoever moves into a new marketplace first defines and sets
the terms of that market. [[If America is first]{.mark} to build the
infrastructure of space, [its **rule of law** and values]{.mark},
including every human's inherent right to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness, [will underpin the marketplace]{.mark}. [If China is
first]{.mark}, [its values will dominate]{.mark}. China continues to
demonstrate a [lack of regard for fair economic practices]{.mark}, the
[rule of law,]{.mark} human dignity, or liberty]{.underline}.

[[From **transportation**, to **energy**, to info]{.mark}rmation, [to
manufacturing]{.mark} goods and services, China's strategy is to
[dominate]{.mark} the key engines of **[economic growth]{.mark}** that
have historically changed world power and it views space as the place to
seize and grow that advantage]{.underline}. It's well-accepted that
technological advantage drives economic prosperity, and economic
prosperity is essential to sustainable national security. Today, China
is applying this principle with new technologies and a superior strategy
in space. [**[America]{.mark}**, on the other hand, is [so
**underinvested**]{.mark}, it is relying on the Russians to launch its
astronauts into space. Fortunately, there is a way out, but only if we
wake up now]{.underline}.

[Most Americans are completely unaware that China has a plan to build
manned labs both on the moon and on Mars. Nor are they aware that China
has publicly announced its plans to build a nuclear powered space
shuttle or its plan to begin mining asteroids by 2040]{.underline}. This
isn't science fiction. China is investing billions and has achieved some
notable firsts including putting the first quantum satellite in orbit,
operating a rover on the far side of the moon, and its simulated Mars
habitat in the Gobi Desert.

[If [China stays on its current path]{.mark}, it will deploy a [power
station in]{.mark} space [that could]{.mark} begin generating energy
before 2040. China will claim that such stations are for peaceful means
only --- beaming clean energy via lasers or microwaves to anyone on
earth --- but they could also [be **weapons**]{.mark}. The same beams
could be [directed at]{.mark} nodes of the [U.S.]{.mark} power grid or a
military base with destructive effect. America has grown accustomed to
holding its adversaries at risk anywhere in the world in hours. China is
developing the capability to have a more sophisticated capability that
can reach virtually any target in seconds.]{.underline}

[[America]{.mark} has become [complacent]{.mark} and mistakes its
rapidly dissipating economic and military advantages as rights. The
United States is making the same mistake that other fallen great powers
have made]{.underline}. Namely, it is doubling down on the approach that
made America successful in previous generations and discounting rising
powers taking new approaches. While the U.S. government nibbles around
the edges of game-changing technologies, the Chinese party-state is
making huge investments in key areas to include: hypersonics, 5G,
supercomputing, artificial intelligence, 3D-printing, quantum computing
, and robotics. China is employing these and other leading-edge
technologies in wholistic and new strategic ways that could render
America a second-rate power.

Most Americans, and many in Congress, have not had that broader picture
painted. Congress is at a crossroads, but some of its members may not
even know it. It is time to make a deliberate decision to compete with
China or to surrender by default. While American companies are working
on these new technologies (albeit in separate silos), real power lies in
harnessing these technologies together from space in intentional and
innovative ways to achieve a dominant competitive advantage. China is
actively pursuing a plan to use space as the ultimate "high ground" to
dominate the global economy and transform economic, military, and
political power in its image. While the United States has used
terrestrial based strategies to contain its adversaries in the past,
China is positioning itself to surround the entire globe from space.

[The good news is that there is [still a way to win]{.mark}. The
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** [can build on]{.mark} key
competitive [advantages]{.mark}: namely, superior cultures [of]{.mark}
creativity and **[innovation]{.mark}**, rooted in an open society and a
free market]{.underline}. The U.S. government should start with a vision
that is both bigger than China's and meaningful to America's society and
values. From there, it can write and implement a strategy that can
secure the American way of life in this century and ensure the goods and
promises offered by space are not dominated by a country disinterested
in human freedom.

[The **[benefits]{.mark}** of such a course of action would appeal to
most Americans, and indeed most people, to [include **clean
energy**]{.mark}, ubiquitous and secure communications, [**protection**
from space objects]{.mark} like the "city killing" **meteor** that hit
Russia, [**deterrence** capabilities]{.mark} that will render nuclear
weapons obsolete, ensure the [**survival of humanity** through
expansion]{.mark}, and even modifying the Earth's weather using
satellites to [slow the effects of **climate
change**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--I/L\-\--Solvency

#### They are [getting close]{.underline} AND [testing]{.underline} proves that it works. 

**Appell 2/5/25** \[Jackie Appell is a writer and editor from
Pennsylvania with a background in astrophysics. "This Company is Getting
Close to Catapulting a Satellite Into Space."
https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/satellites/a63667536/spinlaunch-satellite-catapult/\]
//aka

Space company SpinLaunch is trying to re-invent the system for launching
craft off of our world and into space.

[The goal is to use their centrifuge-like launch mechanism to catapult
objects like satellites out through our atmosphere, **necessitating only
a small second-stage burn to fine-tune their position.**]{.underline}

[Recently, the team executed an important **proof-of-concept
experiment**: demonstrating that the intensity of their launch device
doesn't mean doom for the instruments being launched.]{.underline}

[Launching rockets is serious business. It takes a ton of fuel, a ton of
manpower, a ton of resources, and if it goes bad, it can go really,
really bad. It's also one of the least sustainable parts of an already
incredibly unsustainable industry.]{.underline}

But just because something is serious business and has serious problems,
that doesn't mean it can't have fun solutions. [Enter SpinLaunch, the
company that is trying to chuck satellites into orbit with what is
basically a souped-up catapult using **no rocket fuel.**]{.underline}

Seriously.

The concept, despite being nicely distillable for comedic effect, is not
an inherently ridiculous one. Basically, SpinLaunch has built a large,
disk-shaped centrifuge with an exit shoot positioned along one side and
a clock-style arm attached at the center. At the other end of that arm
sits the housing for a satellite which, once inserted, is spun around
and around at frankly unfathomable speeds. Then, at the perfect moment,
the arm releases its payload, and the satellite is flung out of the exit
chute into the sky.

Once the object exits the chute, it travels through as much of the
atmosphere as it can before activating a secondary propulsion system to
properly position itself in orbit. So, not exactly the no-rocket-fuel
launch that the company may proclaim, but [certainly **much less fuel
usage** than a traditional launch.]{.underline}

Now, none of that has been accomplished yet. [SpinLaunch is still very
much in the testing phase. But, in December of 2024, the company
partnered with Portland State University to reach a **significant
milestone.**]{.underline} They proved that a one unit (1U)
cubesat---that is, [a small, cube-shaped satellite measuring 10
centimeters on all sides---could survive **the full 10,000 Gs of force
necessary** to huck it into space. (For reference, astronauts on
traditional rocket launches throughout history have experienced maximum
forces of between three and six Gs.)]{.underline}

[With just **a few small tweaks** to bolster the integrity of the
satellite, SpinLaunch proved a very important point: that their launch
tech won't... you know... destroy anything it launches. If spinning
space instruments around in a centrifuge inherently spelled doom for the
instrument, there's no real point in pursuing the technology. But
luckily, that doesn't seem to be the case.]{.underline}

"We looked at \[SpinLaunch\], and we said, 'This is redonkulous,'"
Andrew Greenberg, faculty advisor to the Portland State Aerospace
Society (who designed and engineered the cubesat), said in a promotional
video produced by SpinLaunch. "We're building a 1U cubesat. The worst
thing that we could do is build it for 10,000 Gs. We can barely make it
for random \[vibration\]."

NASA\'s New Plasma Rocket Ready For Testing

But SpinLaunch put forth a convincing argument, and Greenburg and his
team of student engineers handed their cubesat over to the company for
"ruggedization." A few tweaks here and there made the cubesat much more
durable---swapping out case materials, rotating battery packs to better
distribute pressure, and reinforcing circuit boards. "While relatively
minimal," Sev Sandomirsky, director of satellite programs at SpinLaunch,
told Gizmodo**[, "these core adjustments ensured the satellite's
structural compatibility for SpinLaunch."]{.underline}**

[The statement proved true upon post-centrifuge examination. After
putting the newly-modified cubesat through some serious paces, the
SpinLaunch team took it out and tested its functionality. Very
excitedly, **everything seemed to be working exactly as it was meant
to.**]{.underline}

"Spinning the 1U has been a part of the development plan from the very
beginning," Sandomirsky said in the promotional video. "We weren't
surprised that the 1U survived because we've built up this engineering
intuition over time, and we have a good sense of what succeeds and what
is susceptible to failure. It\'s really exciting to be able to say that
we've spun a satellite up to 10,000 Gs."

[Next stop: outer space (or, at least, low earth orbit).]{.underline}

Executive Summary

[China's rapid advancement in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet
technology represents a direct challenge to **global US operations,
communications infrastructure, and the free flow of
information.**]{.underline} Leveraging BeiDou's Navigation Satellite
System (BDS), Beijing's Global Positioning System replacement is [poised
to circumvent US technological leadership.]{.underline} Beyond the
battlefield, [China's LEO network serves as an extension of the Great
Firewall, exporting its digital authoritarianism globally. If unchecked,
China could set global internet standards, restricting digital
sovereignty for countries that adopt its system. The United States and
its allies must act swiftly to counter this strategic push.]{.underline}

Introduction

China's growing dominance in space-based infrastructure is not just a
commercial development---it is a calculated geopolitical move. With the
full deployment of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System
(北斗卫星导航系统), Beijing has created a viable alternative to the US
Global Positioning System (GPS), and now it is aggressively expanding
its reach into satellite internet services. On February 11, 2025, China
launched a new batch of satellites for its planned 15,000+ satellite LEO
constellation, aiming to provide global internet services and
positioning, navigation, and timing data worldwide, challenging Western
dominance in space-based communications.

[However, this is far more than just an alternative to Western-backed
services like Starlink and Viasat. China's LEO satellite internet
**presents a threefold risk:**]{.underline}

[It enables China to replace US military GPS reliance worldwide,
**weakening US strategic advantages.**]{.underline}

[It provides a **censorship-controlled internet model** that
authoritarian regimes can adopt, extending Beijing's influence over
**global information flows.**]{.underline}

[It allows China to dictate international technology standards through
bodies like the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), creating
long-term dependencies on Chinese space infrastructure.]{.underline}

[The United States and its allies must recognize this initiative as a
direct challenge to **digital sovereignty,** military security, and
technological leadership and act accordingly.]{.underline}

Weakening US Strategic Advantages

China has already eliminated its military's reliance on the US Global
Positioning System by fully transitioning to its own BeiDou Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Now, Beijing is actively marketing
BeiDou to partner nations, particularly those with anti-Western
alignments, as a strategic alternative to GPS. Countries such as Russia,
Iran, Pakistan, and Venezuela have already begun integrating BeiDou into
their military navigation systems, thereby reducing US leverage over
their military operations and economic sanctions. As part of its broader
geopolitical strategy, China is also incorporating BeiDou into its Belt
and Road Initiative infrastructure deals, ensuring that participating
nations become increasingly dependent on Chinese military navigation and
surveillance capabilities. In a potential Taiwan contingency, **[China
could leverage this dependency by selectively disabling GPS access in
the region while maintaining full BeiDou functionality for its own
forces, creating a significant strategic advantage.]{.underline}**

Secure Communications for Adversaries

[China's LEO satellite network would create a **formidable alternative
to Western-controlled internet** infrastructure. It would allow
adversarial nations such as North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela to
take advantage of this system to operate beyond the reach of US
surveillance and control, effectively insulating themselves from US
economic restrictions and sanctions. **This shift would severely limit
Washington's ability to disrupt financial transactions, intelligence
sharing, and military coordination among hostile regimes.**]{.underline}

[Moreover, China could offer highly secure, encrypted military
communications through its LEO network, reducing the effectiveness of US
signals intelligence and electronic warfare capabilities. With a
dedicated and protected communications backbone, adversarial states
would be able to coordinate sensitive operations without fear of
interception or disruption by US intelligence agencies. This would mark
a significant transformation in global intelligence dynamics, allowing
nations aligned with Beijing to develop more resilient, independent
communication channels that would further weaken US influence in both
military and geopolitical arenas. **If widely adopted, China's LEO
network could reshape the global balance of power by enabling
authoritarian regimes and hostile states to evade Western oversight with
unprecedented ease.**]{.underline}

Information Warfare and Censorship Risks

A Low Earth Orbit Chinese Firewall

China's LEO satellite network is not just a technological advancement;
[it is a direct extension of Beijing's domestic internet control model,
designed to export its censorship regime globally.]{.underline} Unlike
Western satellite services that provide open and unrestricted access,
[China's system can be engineered to **filter information, suppress
dissenting voices, and promote state-approved narratives.**]{.underline}
Through this system, Beijing could enforce its version of the internet
worldwide, blocking foreign media, independent news sources, and social
platforms such as Google, YouTube, and Twitter, [effectively isolating
populations from alternative viewpoints and reinforcing
government-controlled narratives.]{.underline}

[This model would be particularly appealing to **authoritarian
governments** looking to tighten control over their populations.
Authoritarian nations could adopt China's LEO internet service to
suppress internal dissent and restrict media freedom. By offering a
turnkey solution for internet censorship, Beijing would empower regimes
to silence opposition, disrupt political movements, and monitor online
activity with far greater precision than ever before.]{.underline}

Furthermore[, China could leverage its LEO internet as a geopolitical
bargaining tool, providing discounted or even free access to allied
governments while restricting, manipulating, or shutting down service in
adversarial states.]{.underline} Countries that align with Beijing could
receive full, prioritized connectivity, while those that challenge
China's policies---particularly on sensitive issues like Taiwan, Hong
Kong, and the South China Sea---could experience network slowdowns,
disruptions, or outright denial of service.

[This capability would give Beijing an unprecedented level of influence
over digital access, economic activity, and political discourse in
developing nations, further entrenching its control over the global
information ecosystem.]{.underline} If widely adopted, China's LEO
network would represent a fundamental shift in the internet's
governance, moving it away from its decentralized, open foundations
toward a controlled, state-monitored model that serves Beijing's
strategic interests.

The China Data Law: A Built-in Backdoor for the Chinese Communist Party

[One of the most serious and far-reaching risks posed by China's LEO
satellite network is its built-in data **collection and surveillance
mechanisms**, which are deeply embedded in Beijing's legal and
regulatory framework.]{.underline} Under China's 2021 Data Security Law,
all Chinese technology companies are legally obligated to provide any
requested data to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), regardless of where
that data is collected or stored. This law extends far beyond China's
borders, meaning that any data transmitted through China's LEO network
could be subject to surveillance, storage, and potential exploitation by
the Chinese government.

Unlike traditional internet infrastructure, which relies on nationally
regulated internet service providers, China's space-based network
bypasses local oversight altogether. This means that any entity---be it
a government, corporation, or individual---using China's LEO internet
would have its communications exposed to CCP monitoring, creating
massive security vulnerabilities for foreign users. Sensitive commercial
data, government correspondence, and even classified military
communications could be inadvertently routed through a system controlled
by Beijing, granting China real-time access to critical global
information.

Unlike Huawei's 5G infrastructure, which Western nations have largely
been able to ban or remove, China's LEO satellite network presents a
much more difficult challenge. Because LEO satellites operate in space,
they cannot be easily blocked, shut down, or regulated by national
governments, making it nearly impossible to prevent data interception
and surveillance once a country adopts the system. If widely integrated,
[China's LEO internet would become a persistent, uncontrollable
intelligence asset, allowing the CCP to expand its surveillance state
beyond its borders and reshape the digital security landscape in its
favor.]{.underline}

Moreover, the Chinese LEO system would allow Beijing to track real-time
location data of users worldwide, including foreign government
officials, corporate executives, journalists, and political dissidents.
The ability to monitor movements, map networks, and analyze
communication patterns at a global scale would give China unprecedented
intelligence-gathering capabilities, far surpassing traditional cyber
espionage. [This is not a hypothetical concern---Chinese technology has
already been implicated in mass surveillance efforts, including the
tracking of Uyghur populations in Xinjiang and the suppression of
dissent.]{.underline}

China's Long Game in Global Standards Setting

China's long-term strategy in shaping global technology standards is a
critical but often overlooked component of its broader geopolitical
ambitions. Central to this strategy is Beijing's sustained effort to
position its officials within the International Telecommunication Union,
the United Nations agency responsible for setting global norms in
telecommunications, internet governance, and satellite communications.
By securing key leadership roles and influencing decision-making
processes within the ITU, China aims to ensure that future digital
infrastructure, including its LEO satellite internet network, conforms
to standards that favor Chinese technologies and governance models. This
approach reflects a deliberate effort to dictate the technical rules
underpinning global communications, effectively extending Beijing's
influence over how information flows across borders.

If China's LEO satellite network secures alignment with ITU-approved
standards, many developing nations may have no viable alternative but to
adopt it, especially those with limited financial or technological
capacity to build independent systems. Such alignment would enable China
to promote its state-centric, tightly controlled vision of the internet,
marked by censorship, surveillance, and restricted data flows. The
adoption of these standards would not only lock nations into
Chinese-made infrastructure but also expose them to Beijing's data
security regulations, potentially allowing China unprecedented access to
sensitive communications and national security information.

[This scenario poses a significant strategic risk for the United States
and its allies. The world could soon face a **bifurcated internet**,
with one ecosystem operating under democratic, open principles
championed by Western nations, and the other governed by China's
authoritarian digital framework. Such a division would create deep
technological dependencies on Chinese infrastructure among countries in
Asia, Africa, and Latin America, reducing their alignment with Western
norms and increasing Beijing's leverage in geopolitical
negotiations.]{.underline}

Furthermore, this bifurcation would complicate cross-border data
exchanges, international commerce, and global cybersecurity cooperation,
undermining the interoperability that has driven global digital
innovation for decades. If the United States and its allies do not
proactively counter China's influence within the ITU and other
standard-setting bodies, they risk ceding control over the fundamental
rules that will shape the internet and satellite communications for the
foreseeable future. Ultimately, China's success in this arena would
represent not just technological dominance but also a reshaping of the
global order, with profound implications for digital sovereignty,
economic independence, and international security.

Opportunities for the United States and Its Allies

Develop Competitive Western Alternatives

**[The most direct counter to China's expanding LEO satellite internet
ambitions is to invest heavily in Western alternatives that provide
secure, reliable, and open-access satellite internet.]{.underline}** By
supporting initiatives like Starlink, Viasat, and Project Kuiper, the
United States and its allies can prevent China's network from becoming
the default option in emerging markets. These Western-led projects not
only offer high-speed connectivity but also come without the
surveillance risks and information control concerns posed by Chinese
networks.

Opportunity -- The United States should accelerate funding and
deployment for Starlink, Viasat, and Project Kuiper, ensuring that
allies have viable, non-Chinese alternatives for satellite internet.
[This investment will also **enhance interoperability** among allied
forces, strengthen data security, and promote an open internet
infrastructure globally.]{.underline}

Strengthen Economic and Security Partnerships

Emerging markets are key battlegrounds in the digital infrastructure
race. China's Belt and Road Initiative has provided many developing
nations with much-needed digital infrastructure, but at the cost of
increased dependency on Beijing. The United States and its allies must
offer attractive alternatives that not only provide reliable
infrastructure but also respect digital sovereignty and open access
principles.

Opportunity -- The United States should expand digital infrastructure
projects in developing nations by partnering with international
development organizations, private sector leaders, and allied
governments. Initiatives like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment should be used to provide transparent, sustainable, and
secure alternatives, preventing China from dominating emerging markets
and ensuring that these regions remain aligned with democratic values
and open internet principles.

Expand ITU and Global Standards Leadership

China's influence over the ITU presents a long-term challenge, as
control over global standards could lock nations into Chinese-centric
technologies. The United States must counter this by reasserting
leadership in international bodies that set technical standards for
satellite communications and internet governance. By leading
standards-setting processes, the United States can ensure that open,
democratic principles guide the future of the global internet.

Opportunity -- The United States must counter Beijing's influence within
the ITU and other standards bodies by securing leadership positions for
American and allied experts. Additionally, the United States should
drive consensus on standards that emphasize transparency,
interoperability, and data privacy, ensuring that democratic nations
control future internet governance rules and prevent a bifurcated
internet dominated by Chinese norms.

Conclusion

[China's LEO satellite internet initiative is more than an ambitious
infrastructure project---it is a calculated move to dominate military
communications, global internet access, and technological standards. If
left unchecked, this system could diminish US military superiority,
extend Beijing's censorship model, and establish Chinese technological
hegemony for decades. The United States and its allies must take urgent
action to counter this threat, ensuring that the future of space-based
internet remains open, secure, and democratic.]{.underline}

### [2AC\-\--I/L\-\--Sats Fail]{.underline}

#### SpinLaunch fails: PHYSICS

**Siegel 22**\-\--a Ph.D. astrophysicist, and science communicator, who
professes physics and astronomy at various colleges. He has won numerous
awards for science writing since 2008 for his blog, including the award
for best science blog by the Institute of Physics. (Ethan, "Will physics
prevent SpinLaunch from succeeding?", Big Think, 11/17/22,
https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/physics-spinlaunch/) sh

[It's always preferable to build upon already-existing technologies than
it is to have to invent something entirely new]{.underline}, and yet the
latter is very much what's in store for a SpinLaunch payload. The reason
is simple: [if you have a liquid-based fuel on board, you need a
plumbing system to contain and control it; this is exactly the type of
system that will not survive the spin-up accelerations]{.underline} that
SpinLaunch requires.

[This means that solid rocket fuel will need to be used
instead:]{.underline} something with the hardness and durability of
something
like [formica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_(plastic)). In
principle, this can be done, [but it represents a substantial obstacle
toward reaching space.]{.underline}

While solid-propellant rockets offer a number of advantages over
liquid-propellant ones, those advantages include stability, durability,
and reliability. Unfortunately, however, [they have lowered efficiencies
and are less controllable than liquid propellant
alternatives,]{.underline} which is why solid-fuel rockets are primarily
used in military armaments but liquid-fuel rockets are typically used
for spaceflight. [Even if this difficulty can be overcome, the
limitations of solid-fuel applications will inherently limit the mass of
the payloads]{.underline} that can be delivered with SpinLaunch.

Problem #3: [**Piercing the mylar sheet preserving SpinLaunch's vacuum
could destroy the payload**.]{.underline}

Do you remember the unfortunate and tragic Space Shuttle Columbia
disaster? [When Columbia attempted atmospheric re-entry, the spacecraft
catastrophically broke apart, killing all astronauts on]{.underline}
board. The reason the shuttle disintegrated in the atmosphere, however,
[was simply a small, lightweight piece of foam insulation]{.underline}
that struck a portion of the craft at very high speeds. That's a key
concept in physics: [the amount of kinetic energy that something
possesses --- and hence, the amount of damage it can cause in a
collision --- is proportional to its mass, but proportional to its
speed *squared*.]{.underline}

[With an exit velocity of 5,000 miles-per-hour]{.underline} as opposed
to the 1,000 miles-per-hour of the current prototype, that means:

- [the launch vehicle will strike the mylar sheet with 25 times the
  kinetic energy of current tests]{.underline},

- the mylar sheet will impart 25 times the amount of energy as current
  tests to the payload,

- and the [transition from the payload traveling through vacuum to
  traveling through Earth's atmosphere means "hitting a wall" of
  atmosphere that the payload will strike with 25 times the amount of
  force]{.underline} that the current prototype experiences.

Can the launch vehicle/payload survive this set of conditions and remain
fully operational and undamaged? It's possible, but it's never been done
before. Again, this is an unprecedented obstacle that must be overcome.

Problem #4: [**The atmospheric drag force experienced by the payload
will be tremendous**.]{.underline}

If you hold your hand out of a car window when you're traveling at 100
kph (62 mph), how much of a drag force will it experience relative to
traveling at half that speed: 50 kph (31 mph)? The answer isn't twice as
much force, as one might expect, but rather four times as much force.
The drag force you experience is proportional to the cross-sectional
area of the object (your hand, in this case) but also to the velocity
you're moving at squared.

[Normally, rockets start out moving slowly near Earth's surface ---
where the atmosphere is thickest --- and pick up speed as they continue
accelerating up through the atmosphere.]{.underline} The highest speeds
are achieved at the highest altitudes: where the air is thinnest.

Not so [with SpinLaunch; in fact, the reverse is true. The payload will
be moving at its fastest where the atmosphere is the
thickest,]{.underline} which maximizes speed and energy losses due to
drag. [This will also heat up the payload substantially]{.underline},
and in ways that no payload that's ever made it to space before has
experienced. The biggest problem with Project HARP, back when it was
being run, is that [there was no payload that could be launched that
would be capable, at its high altitude, of taking it the rest of the way
to space]{.underline}. Can SpinLaunch overcome that problem? It remains
to be demonstrated.

TAMPA, Fla. --- [The Trump administration has released new rules for
distributing \$42.5 billion in U.S. rural broadband funding, easing
restrictions on Starlink]{.underline} and other satellite providers
competing for support under the Biden-era program.

The Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration ([NTIA) said June 6 it will now apply a
technology-neutral approach in awarding subgrants under]{.underline}
BEAD, or [Broadband Equity,]{.underline} Access, and Deployment.

Congress created the program in 2021 with a focus on fiber to help close
the country's digital divide.

Announcing a review of BEAD in March, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard
Lutnick blamed "woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies,
and burdensome regulations" for the program not yet connecting any
users.

A[rmand Musey, a space industry analyst and founder of advisory firm
Summit Ridge Group, said the tech-neutrality reform provision should
help SpaceX's Starlink, the satellite operator with the most to
gain.]{.underline}

"However, it's not clear how eagerly it will be embraced at the state
and local level," he added, "where there is often a bias towards job
creation, where fiber has more to offer."

NTIA's announcement came a day after a public spat between President
Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, which included threats to cancel the
company's government contracts not long after he ended a formal
cost-cutting advisory role in the administration.

Rural grants take two

SpaceX was provisionally awarded nearly \$900 million in rural broadband
subsidies toward the end of the first Trump administration in 2020,
under a separate program called the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund
(RDOF), managed by the Federal Communications Commission.

However, the FCC said in 2022 that SpaceX failed to demonstrate how it
would meet RDOF requirements, and upheld the denial in 2023 after an
appeal.

In November, shortly after Trump nominated him to lead the agency,
Reuters cited FCC chair Brendan Carr saying he did not expect the grant
to be reinstated, despite previously criticizing the rejection.

[In addition to embracing technology neutrality, the new BEAD rules aim
to streamline environmental reviews, remove workforce mandates and other
regulatory barriers.]{.underline}

[China is rapidly building out its arsenal of counterspace weapons:
everything from ground-based lasers to satellites that can grab other
satellites, all of which pose a "grave threat" to the U.S., according to
Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman. ]{.underline}

[The People's Liberation Army is developing missiles and ground-based
lasers to hit satellites from the ground---systems that could be
deployed before the end of the decade, Saltzman said in
written ]{.underline}[testimony](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/Chance_Saltzman_Testimony.pdf)[ ahead
of his appearance before the ]{.underline}[U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission](https://www.uscc.gov/)[ on Thursday. The
chief's testimony painted one of his most detailed and concerning
assessments of China's growing space threat.]{.underline}

["Aside from missiles, the PLA has fielded multiple ground-based laser
weapons able to disrupt, degrade, or damage satellite sensors. By the
mid-to-late 2020s, we expect them to deploy systems high enough in power
that they can physically damage satellite structures," he
said. ]{.underline}

[Further, China's military routinely employs jammers that can target
space-based communications, radars, and navigation systems, including
the
Pentagon's ]{.underline}[extremely-high-frequency](https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Article/2197713/advanced-extremely-high-frequency-system/#:~:text=The%20Advanced%20Extremely%20High%20Frequency,ground%2C%20sea%20and%20air%20assets.)[ (EHF)
systems.]{.underline}

[Saltzman also mentioned China's kinetic counterspace
operations---including satellites that can
"]{.underline}[dogfight](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/03/china-practicing-dogfighting-space-space-force-says/403863/)["
or
physically ]{.underline}[pull](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2023/03/space-force-building-virtual-training-ground-space-conflict/384561/)[ other
satellites out of orbit.]{.underline}

[One of China's most aggressive initiatives is building a "kill web"
that uses hundreds of satellites to find, track, and target forces on
Earth, Saltzman told the commission on Thursday.]{.underline}

[That means it's no longer sufficient to only focus on protecting U.S.
satellites, he said. The U.S. needs to develop systems that can deny
China's use of its space assets, he said, which is central to the
service's new mission of "space superiority."]{.underline}

["That\'s a new mission set and really rounds out what we say it means
to have space superiority, to use space control: protect ours, but also
deny theirs, and that\'s what we\'re trying to invest more in," Saltzman
said. ]{.underline}

But the Space Force doesn't have enough money to do it. Saltzman said
his service is "critically unfunded." 

"I will tell you that I believe we have more left unfunded than we have
funded. I think the new missions that have been given to the Space
Force, we still haven't developed the size and set of capabilities
necessary to perform those new missions," he said. 

Saltzman said counterspace weapons come in six categories: ground-based
jammers, kinetic weapons, and directed energy weapons, and space-based
versions of all three. He said China is investing in all six, while the
U.S. is not.

[For now, the service is concentrating on ground-based counterspace
weapons, he said, which require less new technology than orbiting
weapons. But the service will need to field weapons in all six areas, he
said, arguing that targets in different orbits will require different
kinds of weapons. ]{.underline}

[Saltzman also said the service is prioritizing jamming and other
non-kinetic effects first---and would only resort to physically
destroying another satellite if there was no other option. ]{.underline}

["Destroying something on orbit, as we\'ve seen with
the ]{.underline}[Chinese in
2007](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-anti-satellite-test)[ and
the ]{.underline}[Russians in
2021](https://www.spacecom.mil/Newsroom/News/Article-Display/Article/2842957/russian-direct-ascent-anti-satellite-missile-test-creates-significant-long-last/)[,
the debris that\'s generated by a destructive force on orbit can be
catastrophic for all of the users of the space domain. And so I feel the
last resort---and something that we don\'t want to create---this
long-lasting, hazardous debris field that can start to make the domain
far less sustainable," he said.]{.underline}

#### Their evidence is pure hype based on bad data.

5G is expected to provide the connective tissue for many emerging
technologies critical to productivity, innovation, and national
competitiveness. [Some commentators]{.underline} have [panicked over
the]{.underline} so-called "[race" for 5G]{.underline}, pointing in fear
at China's hundreds of thousands of new base stations, and projections
of hundreds of millions of 5G subscribers this year alone.

But if we are going to base policy decisions on this race (and it is
questionable that we should), understanding how infrastructure and
subscription numbers are actually counted matters. A closer look reveals
that [China's wireless]{.underline} [infrastructure and subscriber
numbers
are]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} **[impressive]{.underline}** [as
they may first appear]{.underline}: [By counting anyone on a 5G
plan]{.underline}---even if they only have a 4G device connecting to 4G
infrastructure---[as a 5G subscriber, and measuring individual base
stations instead of cell sites, China's 5G stats can paint
a]{.underline} **[misleading picture]{.underline}**. This misleading
picture leads to the interpretation that the sky is falling.

THE SKY IS FALLING: CLAIMS THAT CHINA IS BEATING THE UNITED STATES AT 5G

One can barely scan a technology news site without reading that the
United States is losing to China in 5G, and that this will mean economic
catastrophe. Headlines such as "China's Dominance Of 5G Networks Puts
U.S. Economic Future At Stake" and "China's growing 5G dominance is a
disaster for US security" keep policymakers on edge when considering how
the United States should move forward with the next generation of
wireless.1 The fear is that the first country to build 5G networks will
have a head start in developing the emerging technologies that depend on
5G's low-latency, high-throughput wireless connectivity. As Attorney
General William Barr put it, "China's success in 5G infrastructure is
also translating into advantages in a range of new technologies
associated with 5G."2 He claimed, "Within the next five years, 5G global
territory and application dominance will be determined," and "the stakes
for the United States could not be higher."3

Are these Chicken Littles to be believed? Certainly, China has
advantages in deploying 5G infrastructure, with state-directed companies
making investments that market actors might not. But it is important we
have a strong understanding of the metrics of Chinese 5G deployment, and
the methodology for counting before calling the 5G race.

5G USERS VERSUS SUBSCRIBERS

[Many]{.underline} [reports]{.underline} likely [overstate]{.underline} [the
extent of Chinese 5G]{.underline} [deployment]{.underline} for several
reasons. Part of [this is]{.underline} likely [due
to]{.underline} **[intentional inflation]{.underline}** **[of
statistics]{.underline}** [reported]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [operators]{.underline} [under
pressure from Chinese authorities]{.underline}. [This is
a]{.underline} **[long-standing practice]{.underline}** [in
China]{.underline}, going back at least as far as Mao and agricultural
communes reporting fake crop yields so as not to displease leadership.4
And today they are not unique to the telecom sector, as organizations of
all kinds inflate numbers in order to meet Beijing's expectations. The
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) put out a
statement encouraging telecommunications providers to "accelerate user
migration to 5G through measures such as package upgrade offer, and
credit purchases,
etc."5 [Providers]{.underline} then [started]{.underline} encouraging or
even [forcing]{.underline} [customers to upgrade to]{.underline} [5G
subscriptions]{.underline} [regardless of their actual need, use, or
device]{.underline}.6 [Some]{.underline} companies reduced
5G [subscription prices]{.underline} so much
they [are]{.underline} even [cheaper than]{.underline} staying on
a [4G]{.underline} plan.7 As one reporter put it, "\[W\]ith all of
China's big telcos slashing 5G package prices in the past few months, it
could well be that [customers are being drawn in more by attractive
tariffs than]{.underline} by [a desire to get their hands on the
latest]{.underline} hardware and its
related [capabilities]{.underline}."8 The push for 5G subscribers was
evident before 5G was even activated: Although 5G service was not turned
on in China until November of 2019, Chinese telecom providers listed 9
million 5G users in October 2019, a month prior to its actual
activation.9

Apparently, [the numbers game went]{.underline} **[too
far]{.underline}**, as the MIIT later called upon providers to "clean
up" reporting and end aggressive sales practices after news of
subscriber inflation spread.10 But current numbers are still plagued
with confusion. Consider that [China Telecom and China
Mobile]{.underline} (the two largest operators in China) [reported 150
million]{.underline} ["5G package]{.underline} [customers]{.underline}"
as of September 2020. [But]{.underline} according to China's Academy for
Information and Communications Technology, [only 94
million]{.underline} 5G [devices]{.underline} [had been shipped for all
of China]{.underline} [during the same
time]{.underline} [frame,]{.underline} indicating a sizable gap between
the number of "subscribers" and actual 5G users.11

The discrepancy may be due largely to terminology: "5G package
customers" is a blanket term often used by Chinese carriers to refer to
anyone on a 5G subscription, regardless of whether they actually have a
5G device or access to a 5G network.12 China Mobile acknowledges that
they count anyone "who has subscribed to 5G tariff plans" as a 5G
customer.13 The number of 5G-capable devices alone is impressive, and
the competitive threat from China justifies a thoughtful policy
response, but no one should be worked into a panic by goosed stats.

NETWORK DEPLOYMENT: BASE STATIONS VERSUS CELL SITES

Subscriptions are not the only potentially misunderstood
stat. [Chinese]{.underline} [operators]{.underline} tend
to [count]{.underline} [mobile]{.underline} [infrastructure
differently]{.underline} [from]{.underline} how [Western
operators]{.underline} generally do. The [key difference is between cell
sites]{.underline} (how U.S. telecommunications operators typically
measure deployment) [and base stations]{.underline} (how Chinese
telecommunications operators typically measure deployment). [A cell
site]{.underline} usually [refers to the entire area of a given
tower]{.underline}, which includes potentially multiple base stations
and antennas using different spectrum. The term "[base
station]{.underline}" generally [refers to the equipment each carrier
uses to send signals]{.underline} over multiple antennas at the cell
site. Often [one cell site will have multiple base
stations]{.underline}, sometimes it will host only one. But generally,
it is not a one-to-one conversion between base stations and cell sites
or towers; It is important that these numbers are not conflated to mean
the same thing.

Deployment figures are often further mischaracterized because of the
way [Chinese]{.underline} [operators]{.underline} sometimes [count each
spectrum band as a separate]{.underline} ["logical"]{.underline} [base
station]{.underline} [instead of actual pieces of
equipment]{.underline}.14 Just like how a Wi-Fi router can work on
different spectrum (generally 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), a mobile base station
can operate on multiple spectrum bands. [American
carriers]{.underline} would generally [count a multi-spectrum base
station]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [at
most]{.underline} [one]{.underline} [piece]{.underline} of equipment.
But some Chinese reporting apparently treats each individual spectrum
band a base station supports as a different "logical site."15 A
representative from Huawei explained that "a China Unicom base station
supports GSM 900, GSM 1800, WCDMA 2100 and LTE. Most of the equipment is
deployed in the same room at one physical site, but there are four
bands, so there are four logical sites."16

As a result, [Chinese numbers
could]{.underline} [easily]{.underline} [be misrepresented
as]{.underline} **[three to four times higher]{.underline}** **[compared
with]{.underline}** how **[Western operators]{.underline}** tend to
count equipment.17 Policymakers and the media should take care not to
conflate estimates of base stations for logical sites with actual,
physical cell sites---these are two totally different measurements. For
a rough comparison, it seems fair to assume two or three base stations
per cell site, but the number of logical sites---meaning each spectrum
band used---could be many more.

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE

The raw number of base stations is not always a good measure of a
network's performance. What we really care about is a network's
performance for the population it covers. Measuring performance becomes
increasingly complicated with 5G's diverse spectrum assets, some of
which do not use the traditional cellular architecture.

The utilization of different spectrum resources or amounts of bandwidth
results in varying levels of performance even with equal levels of
infrastructure. This is relevant when comparing [China]{.underline},
which so far [uses exclusively mid-band]{.underline} [spectrum for
5G]{.underline}, with the United States, which has made a large push to
focus on high-band
coverage. [High-band]{.underline} [5G]{.underline} [offers the
highest]{.underline} [performance]{.underline} [leap]{.underline} over
existing networks, at least where it is available.

But that being said, let's try a rough comparison, assuming the similar
spectrum assets and using China's announcement that it anticipates
600,000 5G base stations by the end of 2020.18 Assume three base
stations per Chinese cell site---one for each of the major
operators---and we get about 200,000 sites. This could be several times
lower if we're talking logical sites, but it is hard to say---let's keep
the estimate conservative and set that issue aside.

The population served also plays a big role in the performance of a
given network. China's population is about 1.39 billion. This is about
4.5 times larger than that of the United States, indicating Chinese
operators will need roughly 4.5 times as many base stations as their
U.S. counterparts to get a similar level of performance for each user
(all else being equal). So, those 200,000 sites work out to about 1 site
per 7,000 people. In 2019 alone, U.S. operators invested in 5G-ready
cell sites and added 46,000 new cell sites---roughly 1 site per 7,134
people.19 To the uninformed, 600,000 base stations might sound alarming,
but understanding what those numbers mean, we're about neck-and-neck. If
we assume that the Chinese sites include logical sites, and the spectral
efficiency of their base stations is less, then it appears the United
States is clearly in the lead.

Slow and steady may win the race. [Whereas
the]{.underline} [**U**nited]{.underline} [**S**tates]{.underline} [is
pursuing]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [gradual, economical
deployment]{.underline} [of 5G]{.underline}, the [problems with China's
rushed 5G]{.underline} [deployments are already]{.underline} **[starting

of [Huawei's]{.underline} [own]{.underline} [executives]{.underline} went
so far as to [call]{.underline} [China's 5G "fake,]{.underline} [dumb
and poor]{.underline}," mostly [due to]{.underline} **[poor

Another former official warned in a recent speech that [China's 5G
push]{.underline} [could become a]{.underline} **[failed
investment]{.underline}**.22 While China is no doubt investing
substantially in the expansion of its 5G network, including by
pressuring its state-owned carriers to invest faster than the market
demands, Chinese figures must be properly scrutinized when using them to
make U.S. policy decisions.

CONCLUSION

It is important that the advocates, experts, and policymakers in the
United States get these comparisons right if U.S. policy is going to be
oriented toward winning the race. Even with these numbers possibly being
misrepresented and overinflated, China's 5G ambitions should not be
underestimated. The country's deliberate all-hands-on-deck approach to
fast-track these networks demonstrates China's commitment to gaining an
edge with the industries of the future. And federal, state, and local
policy should also work to spur the expeditious and widespread
deployment of 5G systems by wireless carriers.23 And policymakers and
the media should view Chinese operators' 5G claims with
skepticism. [Chinese firms]{.underline} [count]{.underline} their [5G
deployment and subscribers differently]{.underline} than U.S. operators,
so [these]{.underline} [methodologies can be misleading]{.underline} [if
improperly compared]{.underline}.
