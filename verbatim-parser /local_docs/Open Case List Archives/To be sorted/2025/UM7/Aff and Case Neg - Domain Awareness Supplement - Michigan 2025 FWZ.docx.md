[[Russia's increased operations approached Alaska's coast repeatedly in
September]{.mark}, [with planes entering Alaska's air defense]{.mark}
identification [zone]{.mark} (ADIZ) [four times in five days]{.mark}.
Lt. Gen. Case Cunningham, chief of Alaskan Command and U.S. Northern
Command, said those recent flybys did not show a weapon profile, but
[Russian bombers]{.mark} in future missions [could carry cruise
missiles, posing]{.mark} a [strategic risk]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

["The [Russians have modernized their cruise missile
capabilities]{.mark} and have postured them in key regions," said
Stutzriem. [Russian]{.mark} Kalibr long-range [precision
missiles]{.mark} and hypersonic Zircon missiles, which can reach Mach 9,
[pose a particular challenge]{.mark}. "[We don't have enough domain
awareness to]{.mark} [provide sufficient decision time to]{.mark}
effectively dissuade or [deter such threats]{.mark}," Stutzriem said.
"That puts us at a significant disadvantage from a homeland security
perspective."]{.underline}

Former NORAD boss retired Gen. Glen D. VanHerck sought better Arctic
monitoring and increased funding to defend the High North, efforts that
gained urgency after a Chinese spy balloon slipped past NORAD radars
undetected in early 2023, drifting all the way across the U.S. before
being shot down over the Atlantic.

But Cunningham said what is most concerning now "is Russia's cooperation
with the PRC (People's Republic of China)." 

[[In July]{.mark}, NORAD tracked [two Chinese Xian H-6s and two Russian
Tu-95s]{.mark}, escorted by Russian fighter jets, [flying
through]{.mark} the [Alaskan ADIZ]{.mark}. It was the first appearance
of Beijing's bombers in a combined patrol through the
area. ]{.underline}

[U.S. experts said the flights marked the eighth time the two flew
together since 2019, and while they don't signify true interoperability,
they remain a "significant" concern. ]{.underline}

"Russia is providing access to China," Cunningham said. "Those
\[Chinese\] H-6K bombers took off from a Russian air base."            

Guillot noted that "China spends a lot more time up there" in the Arctic
today than it did in years past. "It shows, on a daily basis, that the
Arctic is an area where a number of nations are showing interest, not
only for military purposes, but also for scientific purposes."

Since declaring itself a "near-Arctic State" in 2018, China has
demonstrated its interest in the Arctic for both economic and strategic
reasons. Beijing views melting ice caps as a gateway to new trade
routes, and it may seek to leverage Russia's Arctic activities to
bolster its own presence and awareness in the region.  

[Meanwhile, [U.S. observers fret that the Air Force is dragging its feet
on acquiring]{.mark} OTHR [capability in the Arctic region]{.mark}. The
service has pushed back its investment from 2024 to at least
2026. ]{.underline}

[Stutzriem said [drones are]{.mark} not [a]{.mark} replacement for that
system, but a [complement]{.mark}: Once the radar arrives, air-breathing
sensing will remain "indispensable for real-time, detailed information
gathering."]{.underline}

["There's [always a need for aircraft to complement]{.mark}
over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) and [space-based sensors]{.mark},"
Stutzriem said. "While space-based sensing will grow over time,
[airborne sensors remain vital]{.mark} for focusing on specific areas,
[to provide]{.mark} higher-fidelity [data, precise target location, and
tactical, targeted operations."]{.mark}]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--Chinese Surveillance

#### Chinese surveillance in the arctic is increasing

the Arctic", BBC NEWS, 2-22-23,
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64727713

[[Canada\'s military]{.mark} has said it [recently discovered evidence
of Chinese surveillance efforts in the Arctic]{.mark}. The discovery,
first reported by Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, has raised
questions about China\'s activities in the far north. It [comes
after]{.mark} a [suspected Chinese spy balloon floated through US and
Canadian airspace]{.mark} before it was shot down by the US military.
[China]{.mark} has [also]{.mark} been [recently accused of interfering
with Canadian elections]{.mark}. [Monitoring buoys were discovered and
retrieved last fall]{.mark} as part of Operation Limpid, an ongoing
mission by the Canadian military tasked with identifying threats to the
country\'s security by surveilling air, land and sea domains. A
spokesperson for [Canada\'s D]{.mark}epartment of [N]{.mark}ational
[D]{.mark}efence, Daniel Le Bouthillier, [said]{.mark} in a statement
that [the military \"is fully aware of recent efforts by China to
conduct surveillance operations in Canadian airspace and maritime
approaches\"]{.mark}. Mr Le Bouthillier added that [China does this
using \"dual-purpose technologies\",]{.mark} meaning [devices that
conduct surveillance both for research and military purposes]{.mark}. He
said the [military has stopped attempts]{.mark} to surveil Canadian
territory [since 2022]{.mark}, but did not elaborate on their nature.
[China has long displayed interest in the Arctic]{.mark}. It has sent
high-level figures to the region 33 times in the last two decades, and
[participates in most]{.mark} major [Arctic institutions]{.mark}. It has
also expanded its icebreaker fleet and sent naval vessels to the north,
often for research expeditions. China hopes to unlock a shorter trade
route to Europe through the region as ice sheets melt due to climate
change, and gain access to emerging resources. But [experts say that
China\'s research interests in the region]{.mark} have [also doubled as
attempts to surveil military assets in the Arctic.]{.mark} Their efforts
are tied to a larger drive by several Arctic nations - namely the US,
Canada, Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden - to unlock untapped
potential in the region.]{.underline}

### IL\-\-- Arctic Deterrence

#### Drones efficiently solve credible deterrence in the Arctic.

[When it comes to investing in Arctic security, the Arctic 7
countries---all of which are NATO allies except for pending member
Sweden---are largely playing catch-up in their efforts to counter
Russia's investments. However, over the past year, US and NATO leaders
have woken up to the evolving environment and have reinvigorated their
focus on Arctic security. [If the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its Arctic [allies hope to]{.mark} quickly
[improve security]{.mark} in this vast region, [they will need to expand
Arctic awareness in a way that]{.mark} is efficient, is cost effective,
and [reduces risk to personnel and critical assets]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[New [modernized Arctic bases]{.mark} and fleets could expand Arctic
awareness, but [they're a tall order]{.mark}, even in the long term. The
Arctic is a very harsh environment for ground forces, and expensive
naval vessels and manned aircraft cannot safely and efficiently cover
the region without backup. For example, manned aircraft traditionally
need a secondary rescue capacity in case they go down. This requires
costly resources in terms of additional training, personnel, basing, and
aircraft.]{.underline}

[However, [cost-effective]{.mark}, [Arctic-ready unmanned aircraft
systems (UAS]{.mark}) may [help the allies fill their security
gaps]{.mark} today. If a UAS goes down, there is no need for a rapid
rescue mission because the remote pilot and crew are safely on the
ground in another location. As a cost-effective complement to manned
assets, UAS also can remotely fly longer missions using satellite
communications, connect joint forces, and maintain a shared real-time
intelligence picture of the Arctic, reducing the overall cost of
expanded operations and eliminating risks to human pilots or crew.
[Leveraging UAS would enable Arctic allies to]{.mark} quickly [expand
coverage]{.mark} in the region [from anywhere in the world]{.mark}.
(Disclosure: I work for General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which
manufactures one of several such UAS models.)]{.underline}

[With climate change's dramatic effects on the Arctic, and the resulting
increased maritime traffic and geopolitical competition for commercial
control, NATO will [need continuous airborne situational
awareness]{.mark} and communications [within the]{.mark} Alliance and
with [Arctic]{.mark} partners. New Arctic-ready [UAS]{.mark} [are
ideal]{.mark} assets [for conducting]{.mark} such [civil
operations]{.mark} in the Arctic. With the ability to withstand
extremely low temperatures and the ability to fly long missions via
satellite, Arctic-ready UAS are [well suited for]{.mark} continuously
[monitoring shipping lanes, fisheries, and environmental disasters, and
for conducting search and rescue operations.]{.mark} More UAS over the
Arctic [could enhance cooperation]{.mark}, help [ensure the safety of
peaceful commercial activity, and improve climate
security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For example, if a ship is in distress and a UAS is on mission, the
aircraft can easily be tasked to provide video, radar, and
communications relay in support of first responders; the UAS could
potentially deploy life-saving emergency supplies directly. Similarly,
if there are reports of illicit fishing operations and a suspected
vessel turns off its transponder identification, UAS can help
authorities to locate, identify, and apprehend the vessel, removing the
guesswork and initial risks to human patrols.

Arctic-ready UAS can also be valuable research tools for monitoring
wildlife, icemelt, and more to help scientists understand the
environmental and community impacts of climate change, despite
complications brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Before, Russia
and the Arctic 7 were largely able to collaborate on important
environmental research and socio-economic development activities in the
region through the [Arctic Council](https://arctic-council.org/about/).
But due to Russia's invasion, the Arctic 7 countries have largely
isolated Moscow from ongoing activities at a cost of resources and
regional access. The use of UAS could help fill gaps by supporting
important airborne research on the impacts of climate change on Arctic
ecosystems and communities.

[The United States and NATO need to focus on quickly expanding
collective surveillance capabilities to help deter aggression, avoid
unnecessary escalation, and strengthen cooperation between Arctic allies
and partners. [Many available UAS]{.mark}, which are familiar among the
US Air Force and NATO allies who widely operate them already, [could
help quickly and cost-effectively monitor and address Russian activity
in the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A fleet of [Arctic-ready UAS would significantly multiply the
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of joint
forces and serve as a credible deterrent at lower costs]{.mark}---and
without risking lives. And because many UAS are generally flexible,
[commanders can tailor them for a growing list of missions]{.mark} with
unique intelligence payloads, including submarine detection
capabilities. Some UAS can dispense and monitor sonobuoys to detect and
track Russian submarines to help protect vulnerable maritime assets.
Some new UAS can also detect various signals at long ranges, making them
a formidable early warning system for incoming Russian aircraft,
vessels, or even missile systems.]{.underline}

[These capabilities would enhance the United States' and NATO's
understanding of Russia's actions and intentions in the region, reducing
the risk of unnecessary escalations. In addition, [with UAS on pa8trol,
NATO allies could let any malign actors know that they are being watched
to deter aggression in disputed or contested areas. This is often
referred to as ]{.mark}]{.underline}[["deterrence by
detection."]{.mark}](https://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1518)

With Arctic security challenges on the rise, the United States and NATO
need to rapidly strengthen their collective security in the tundra. In
the short term, Arctic-ready UAS could bolster joint forces' and civil
authorities' abilities to collect and deliver actionable information
over satellite to the Arctic 7 and the wider allied intelligence
community, while removing risk to human pilots and decreasing the
overall cost of expanded and sustained security operations. A more
complete shared intelligence picture will strengthen awareness and
cooperation in the Arctic as allies adapt to and address evolving
security challenges.

#### UAVs are a game changer for effective maritime denial.

https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/september/drones-deterrence#:\~:text=Tangredi\'s%20other%20argument%20is%20that,targeting%20and%20further%20Russian%20losses.

[Antiaccess/area-denial (A2/AD) is, in essence, the PLA's technological
and
organizational ]{.underline}[answer](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/508167-two-us-carriers-through-the-taiwan-strait-in-48-years-time-for-more/)[ to
the capabilities that enabled U.S. Navy sea control in 1996, when the
Nimitz Carrier Strike Group last sailed through the Taiwan Strait. A2/AD
is China's theater deterrence. [To undermine Chinese A2/AD capabilities,
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must]{.mark} be capable of
reestablishing local sea control and [extend theater deterrence through
2026]{.mark}. Admiral Stavridis would ]{.underline}[[advocate coalition
building](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2021/july/great-power-competition-requires-theater-deterrence)[,
improved technology, and]{.underline}]{.mark} [paradigm-shifting
tactics, techniques, and procedures [(TTPs)]{.mark}. [Unmanned systems
lie at the intersection of those three ingredients.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Retired Navy Captain Sam Tangredi would likely agree that nuclear
deterrence will not be enough to deter war with China but that emerging
technologies with associated TTPs will. The thesis of his prize-winning
2024 *Proceedings *essay, "Replicate Ordnance, Not Cheap Drones," is
that drones are not the correct technology. He has two main arguments
against unmanned systems. 

First, China "is the very source of many of the cheap components needed
for low-cost
'[replication](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/march/replicate-ordnance-not-cheap-drones),'"
is a sound concern. The supply chain for drone components today is
vulnerable to exploitation. However, the Pentagon's Replicator
initiative, headed by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, has
two goals. One is to create an inventory of multisized, multidomain,
attritable and non-attritable unmanned systems. The other is
to [galvanize](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2023/12/19/replicator-an-inside-look-at-the-pentagons-ambitious-drone-program/) the
U.S.-based defense industrial base. 

[Tangredi's other argument is that, although UAS and USVs have created
tactical advantages in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, "They have not
had ]{.underline}[strategic effect](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/march/replicate-ordnance-not-cheap-drones)[."
This is incorrect. [Using drones]{.mark} such as the Magura
v5---domestically produced small USVs---Ukraine
[has ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[functionally](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-6852876)[ imposed
sea denial on the vastly superior Black Sea Fleet with little
navy]{.underline}]{.mark} [to speak of. Open-source reporting notes that
the Russian Navy is increasingly unwilling to send Kalibr-capable
surface combatants out of Sevastopol. Black Sea Fleet stagnancy in
Sevastopal has
[created ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[opportunities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2024/03/24/ukraine-just-blew-up-two-more-russian-landing-ships-its-too-late-to-matter/)[ for
more traditional targeting and further Russian
losses.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Though the Black Sea and the Taiwan Strait
have important differences, [unmanned systems have been a game-changing
technology in every war]{.mark} in which [they]{.mark} have [played a
part.]{.mark} Tangredi's alternative---mass-producing existing munitions
to bolster magazine depth in preparation for major conflict---is also
essential. Both must be done.]{.underline}

Within the 2026 scenario framework, Retired Captain Scott Tait and
Commander Anthony LaPova, U.S. Navy, describe a two-phased approach to
gaining sea control after initial PLAN aggression: rollback and shifting
from defense to offense. Their description of rollback from east to
west, presumably all the way back to Mainland China, is ambiguous:
"[Rollback](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2023/december/it-all-comes-down-sea-control) would
require a large number of ships and weapons and support from other Navy
warfare communities, the joint force, and allies, all with
well-practiced, robust, and resilient command and control (C2) and
interoperability on a scale not seen at sea since the 1945 Battle of
Okinawa." However, even with perfect C2 and interoperability, such a
rollback without unmanned systems will likely cost thousands of U.S.
sailors their lives. 

[Tait and LaPova give unmanned systems their due, though, pointing out
that
"]{.underline}[[uncrewed](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2023/december/it-all-comes-down-sea-control)[ systems]{.underline}]{.mark}
[of all sizes [would swarm in the air, on the surface, and undersea.
They would provide intelligence and targeting, deceive and overwhelm
enemy sensors, attack PLAN ships and submarines, and mine port
entrances.]{.mark}" Captain Tangredi similarly ]{.underline}[points
out](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/march/replicate-ordnance-not-cheap-drones)[ two
tasks for unmanned systems in the face of an invasion: [overwhelming
PLAN defenses]{.mark} with high numbers of small kinetic drones [and
providing communication relays]{.mark} for a variety of
circuits.]{.underline}

Retired Navy Admiral Sandy Winnefeld has written many times about the
importance of mine warfare, including his War of 2026 scenario piece
"Mine Warfare Could be Key." One of
Winnefeld's [recommendations](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2023/december/mine-warfare-could-be-key)---adding
jet propulsion to Quickstrike-Extended Range mine kits (500- and
1000-pound general purpose bombs converted to shallow water mines) for
more airdrop options---may be infeasible within the next two years
because of sluggishness in the acquisition process. But small USVs with
substantial loiter capabilities could achieve several of the effects
Winnefeld identifies as decisive. A loitering USV or unmanned underwater
vehicle (UUV) is not so different from a mine, it turns out.

The only limits to unmanned systems mission concepts are a warfighter's
imagination and ability to iterate. Unmanned systems iterations and
operations should be easier to approve than similar ones using manned
platforms. Unmanned systems are more expendable than any human and
therefore commanders should be more willing to accept risk to systems
during experimentation in the United States and operations overseas.
There are, however, concerns about adversary recovery of uncrewed
systems and their sensitive payloads. Outfitting drones with a kinetic
or a software-based antitampering device would be a simple solution.

#### Investing in Arctic drones now is critical to compete with Russia.

<https://irregularwarfare.org/articles/enhancing-arctic-security-role-drones-high-north/>\]

[[America's drones **struggle** to compete]{.mark} against Russia [in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2019,
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} equivalent of the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency [announced a drone [capable of remaining
airborne]{.mark} for [four]{.mark} [consecutive days]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [Russian state sources report their drones can
navigate in the Arctic without]{.underline} the use of [jammable
satellite-based]{.underline} navigation instead employing the
alternative GIRSAM system. While the processes behind this system are
unknown, supposedly it does not rely on GPS satellites or those of the
Russian-developed GLONASS. [Not until]{.underline} 2021---[[two years
later]{.underline}]{.mark}---did [[an American]{.underline}]{.mark}
MQ-9A Reaper [[drone complete]{.mark} a flight navigating with
satellites past the seventy-eighth parallel north]{.underline}.
Additionally, [Russia plans to build an Arctic drone reconnaissance base
four hundred and twenty miles off the Alaskan coastline. [By
2025,]{.mark} [the ability of Russian drones]{.mark} [to monitor]{.mark}
air, surface, and subsurface activity [will **far outpace** the United
States]{.mark} in the Arctic region]{.underline}. [[The Arctic security
environment is of **significant national interest**]{.mark} to Russia
and the United States]{.underline}. And this [**[interest will only
grow]{.mark}** as Arctic nations exploit the substantial natural gas
reserves and the opening of the Northern Sea Route to intercontinental
shipping]{.underline}. If current trends hold, Russia's polar drone
superiority will continue unless the United States can adequately
develop winterized drones. Today, American Arctic-aligned units possess
limited options when deploying these technologies. US policymakers have
begun to recognize this. The Army's Regaining Arctic Dominance strategy
states that manned aerial systems face limits due to the region's frigid
temperatures, but that employing Arctic-adapted drones will serve as a
"combat multiplier" in projecting presence. In the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, the Senate Committee on Armed
Services recognized that "in order to support persistent operations in
austere environments, additional investment in expeditionary launch and
recovery capabilities is warranted." But much remains to be done. Units
operating in the high north will be at a disadvantage until the United
States develops drones that can operate in the Arctic's extreme
conditions. The Value of Drones in the Arctic [**American
[Arctic-adapted]{.mark}** [drones are **cost-effective**]{.mark} **[for
intel]{.mark}**ligence [and]{.mark} [operation]{.mark}al
preparation]{.underline}, in-extremis sustainment, [and
targeting]{.underline} when compared to conventional helicopters or
aircraft. The [[development of polar drones does not necessitate new
technologies]{.mark}, [but rather requires **augmenting existing
systems**]{.mark}]{.underline}. During everyday competition,
[Arctic-adapted drones would provide **unique intelligence collection**
platforms to enhance intelligence and operational
preparation]{.underline}. [[Sensors onboard Arctic drones will **enhance
the decision-making**]{.mark} of US commanders]{.underline}.
[[Hyperspectral imagery can]{.underline}]{.mark} expose electromagnetic
equipment and [[collect information for enemy]{.mark} [analysis]{.mark}.
These [systems can also detect]{.mark}, measure, and discover
radioactivity that could identify **[underground nuclear
facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore[, [polar drones can
inform military commanders]{.mark} through thermal infrared heat imaging
of the adversary's physical footprint]{.underline}. Compared to
satellites and manned aircraft, [drones outperform in spectral and
temporal resolution]{.underline}. Drone spectral imagery resolution can
measure distances as small as one centimeter in photos. This surpasses
satellite and manned aircraft imagery, which are only optimized for one
to twenty meters. And while drone and aircraft temporal resolution
processing takes hours to days; satellites require days to weeks.
[Alongside the benefits drones provide to commanders in collecting
intelligence, [they]{.mark} can also help [resolve **logistical
constraints**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the moment, the military's main
sustainment vehicle in the Arctic is the outdated Small Unit Support
Vehicle. The military recognizes the system is obsolete and is scheduled
to field the Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle in 2022 to transport
cargo. [Harsh weather conditions, meanwhile, consistently degrade
helicopter performance and their viability for sustainment options.
[Drones]{.mark} also [travel greater ranges faster]{.mark} [than
ground]{.mark} support [vehicles]{.mark} in resupply
missions]{.underline}. The Bv-206S Small Unit Support Vehicle has a
three-hundred-kilometer range and a maximum speed of fifty-two
kilometers per hour on roads and 4.7 kilometers per hour in water. The
Oshkosh Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle, derived from the Bronco
platforms, has a five-hundred-kilometer range and a maximum speed of
sixty-five kilometers per hour on roads and five kilometers per hour in
water. The ArcticShark drone, a winterized TigerShark military-grade
surveillance drone, has a 1,184-kilometer range and a maximum speed of
148 kilometers per hour. The increased speed and reach of drones enable
a maneuver unit to receive rapid support at a greater distance. [What's
more, drones can provide in-extremis resupply in the
Arctic]{.underline}. When maneuvering in high elevation and
below-freezing temperatures, the human body requires additional
nutrition and equipment to operate. The average adult consumes
2,000--2,500 calories per day; in the Arctic, however, soldiers need at
least eight thousand calories just to maintain their weight. This
consumption rate requires each soldier to eat seven Meals, Ready-to-Eat
per day before counting their combat calories. Soldiers cannot afford to
carry the additional weight of seven meals, but [cargo-based drones can
help resolve these routine logistical issues]{.underline}. A
platoon-sized element would require four ArcticShark drones as each
system can deliver sixty-two Meals, Read-to-Eat. Although the Cold
Weather All-Terrain Vehicle aims to satisfy this functionality, drones
provide a rapid solution because of their flexibility to bypass ground
obstacles. However, the ArcticShark drone would need airdrop
capabilities and improved handling in high wind conditions to
effectively resupply remote units. [Finally, [drones help commanders
find and strike enemy targets]{.mark}. In the Arctic, [destroying
support vehicles and]{.mark} air [defense systems, such as
Russia]{.mark}'s Bastion-P and Pantsir-S1, [will be especially
important]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arctic-adapted drones could deliver
precision ordnance to destroy enemy targets and support units while they
maneuver against the enemy. In short, [the benefits of developing
cold-weather drones for sustainment, reconnaissance, and targeting in
the Arctic far outweigh the costs associated with implementing these
updates. [The U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates would do well to ramp up
[work on these programs **before it falls too far behind**]{.mark} its
competitors.]{.underline}

### Solves\-\--Arctic Challenges

#### Drones contribute to natural disaster response and other capabilities in the Arctic.

**NBT 13** -- The Norwegian Board of Technology is an independent body
for technology assessment established by the Norwegian Government in
1999, following an initiative by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget).
"Drones in the Arctic", NBT, 10-11-13,
<https://teknologiradet.no/en/drones-in-the-arctic/> newsci moyin;)

[Tough [weather conditions and]{.mark} vast [distances are challenges in
The Arctic]{.mark}. [Using drones]{.mark} as a part of the Norwegian
SAR-capacity [could mean that operations could be conducted more safely,
quickly and at a lower cost,]{.mark} says Moe.]{.underline}

[Drones, also known as [unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]{.mark}, [are
partially able to fly on their own. Drones]{.mark} come in all sizes
with all kinds of different flight ranges. [Even if they are associated
with military purposes, other sectors experience]{.mark} great
[growth.]{.mark} [Drones]{.mark} can [monitor and gather information
faster]{.mark} and at a lower cost [than]{.mark} manned [planes or
helicopters.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[According to Moe, [because drones can fly without a crew]{.mark}, [they
can perform high risk missions without]{.mark} exposing crew-members to
[danger.]{.mark} For example, [unmanned drones]{.mark} were [used to
assess the damages]{.mark} and radiation-levels [in]{.mark} the
[aftermath of]{.mark} the Fukushima [nuclear
disaster]{.mark}.]{.underline}

By combining the advantages of manned and unmanned aircrafts, such as
executing search and rescue operations where drones do the searching and
manned aircrafts or boats do the rescuing, we can considerably increase
SAR capacity in a simple and cost effective way.

-- Drones equipped with thermographic cameras and other intelligent
searching systems can monitor wide swaths of sea, during challenging
weather conditions and without putting the lives of crew members at
risk, says Moe.

here remain significant technical challenges when flying and navigating
drones in arctic conditions, but the technology is developing quickly,
especially with regard to improving the capacity to sustain extreme
weather conditions and icing.

The Nordic countries should consider harmonizing their drone regulations
for research and search and rescue purposes. It is also important to
expand the access to telecommunication networks in arctic areas. Without
being connected to a broadband network, drones are able to fly but not
to efficiently send data back home.

Surveillance and threats to privacy are challenges affecting use of
drones in populated areas. Aviation safety and risk of accidents is

As this vignette suggests, [[the time has come for the **U.S.**]{.mark}
**Navy** [to **pass** the **freedom of navigation mission** set to
**unmanned systems**]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} shift would [provide
s]{.mark}ignificant **benefits**, including substantial [cost savings, a
reduced risk to human life,]{.mark} increased [flexibility in escalation
dynamics, and an]{.mark} asymmetric [answer to geographically
advantaged]{.mark} peer [competitors]{.mark} in distant oceans.
Moreover, [using **unmanned systems for FONOPs** could]{.mark} help to
**[establish]{.mark}** the desired U.S. government
**[precedent]{.mark}** regarding these platforms and the law of the
sea.]{.underline} The U.S. Navy's proactive demonstration of unmanned
system operation across the globe could clearly communicate expected
norms regarding their usage under existing conventions and customary
law.

A FONOPs Primer

In order to understand the future of FONOPs within the context of
unmanned systems, one should first examine the genesis of the U.S.
Navy's freedom of navigation program, as well as the successes and
challenges attributed to it by observers throughout its forty years of
existence. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea codifies customary
international legal concepts pertinent to maritime claims. As President
Ronald Reagan outlined in his 1983 speech on oceans policy, [the United
States "will exercise and **assert** its **navigation** and **overflight
rights** and **freedoms** on a worldwide basis in a manner that is
**consistent** with the **balance of interests** reflected in the
convention."]{.underline}

Despite substantial commercial and government support for the
convention, the U.S. Senate has not joined over 160 other countries in
ratifying the 1982 law of the sea agreement. Initially, American
opponents of ratification feared that the convention's provisions for
the governance of deep-seabed mining would run counter to domestic
interests. More recently, concerns including sovereignty issues and
environmental restrictions have prevented the necessary Senate
ratification vote from occurring. Both Presidents George W. Bush and
Barack Obama pushed aggressively for ratification, yet failed due to
political opposition. And while the current administration has largely
remained quiet on any renewed efforts, in 2007 then-Senator Joe Biden
led an unsuccessful attempt to move forward with ratification as the
chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Even without congressional ratification of the convention, legal experts
cite enduring maritime law traditions that can create widely accepted
customary rules without a specific requirement for binding international
agreements. Based on this fundamental concept of customary international
law, [over the last four decades the **U.S. freedom of navigation
program** has **combined diplomatic efforts** with **at-sea operations**
across the globe, sailing or flying through excessive maritime claims to
reinforce the American interpretation of customary maritime claims.
[Through these operations, the U.S.]{.mark} government **[contests
claims]{.mark}** --- against allies and antagonists alike ---
[with]{.mark} [a]{.mark} military [**presence** in the disputed
**zone**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Each year, a number of these excessive
claims are contested. In Fiscal Year 2020, for instance, the Department
of Defense challenged 28 separate excessive claims made by 19 different
countries. Each challenge can represent a larger tempo of operations, as
one listed maritime challenge may include multiple passages by U.S.
assets throughout the year. [Proponents of **[FONOPs]{.mark}** assert
that the program [deserves credit for]{.mark} the **freedom** of the
global **commons** enjoyed by maritime shipping today, [the continued
**expansion** of global sea **trade**]{.mark} over the last forty years,
[and a **normalization** of maritime **claims** in line with convention
standards]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 2016 Chinese refusal to recognize
the arbitral tribunal's decision regarding disputes in the South China
Sea bolsters the case for U.S. FONOPs, highlighting the difficulty in
enforcing the convention through purely diplomatic efforts at the
international level. FONOPs detractors, meanwhile, perceive the program
as unnecessarily offensive in nature, emphasize the persistent threat of
collision at sea with resulting escalation concerns, and question
whether any behavioral changes can actually be attributed to military
contestations. Activity under the freedom of navigation program, which
is approved and directed at the presidential level, has largely remained
steady during recent administrations. This trend implies that
[[**American leadership values** the **program** and **supports** the
**conclusion** that **FONOPs** will remain a **vital** and **visible**
part of U.S. **national security** policy going
forward.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Advantages of Unmanned Systems During FONOPs

While forty years have elapsed since FONOPs' inception, the tools used
to execute the mission in 2021 still resemble those used in 1981.
[Twenty-first century **[unmanned]{.mark}** systems
**[technology]{.mark}** offers **opportunities** to
**[mitigate]{.mark}** past [**weaknesses** and **amplify**]{.mark}
current **[strengths]{.mark}**. By [**saving money** and **reducing
risk**]{.mark} while **providing** a **response** to rapidly expanding
**adversarial fleets**, [the U.S.]{.mark} Navy [can leverage unmanned
FONOPs to breathe new life into the program during a vital period in its
existence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

An Efficient Use of Assets

[The **Department of Defense** can **realize** significant and
much-needed cost **savings** by using **unmanned** platforms for the
freedom of navigation mission set.]{.underline} The state-of-the-art
Arleigh Burke Flight III destroyer, a likely candidate for completing
FONOPs in the twenty-first century, has an estimated unit cost of \$1.8
billion versus approximately \$35 million for a medium-sized unmanned
system prototype. [Beyond the reduced initial investment, experts
estimate daily **operating [costs ]{.mark}**[for]{.mark} the [manned
destroyer at \$700,000 versus]{.mark} a **[\$20,000]{.mark}** daily
price tag [for unmanned]{.mark} surface [systems]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as the Sea Hunter[. In a time of flat-line Department of Defense
budgets and a stated Department of the Navy desire to focus further on
unmanned systems, [employing drone **tech**]{.mark}**nology** for these
operations [**provides clear cost advantages** while **aligning** with
**modernization**]{.mark} efforts. Besides monetary savings, the use of
[unmanned systems]{.mark} for these missions **[allows]{.mark}**
more-capable [**manned platforms to focus** on]{.mark} those [**tasks**
that **require**]{.mark} different competences or a [**human**
touch]{.mark}.]{.underline} FONOPs fall neatly into the category of
"dull, dirty, and dangerous" operations that best fit unmanned systems.
[[An **unmanned** system can easily **refute**]{.mark} a challenged
nation's [**excessive** maritime **claim**]{.mark} that requires prior
permission for innocent transit by conducting an unannounced
straight-line passage through disputed waters, freeing a manned vessel
and its crew to conduct more in-depth operations elsewhere.]{.underline}

[[**Robots** Can **Reduce Risk** While **Providing
Flexibility**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[In the event of a **miscalculation** on either side during an unplanned
encounter at sea **involving unmanned assets**, metal and electronics
may incur damage, but [**no** human **life** will be
**lost**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As recent non-FONOP ship collisions have
shown, when two large-tonnage vessels collide at sea, a tragic loss of
life may result. [[By **removing** the **potential** for]{.mark} this
**[loss of life]{.mark}** from a collision in contested waters, the use
of **[unmanned]{.mark}** systems during **[FONOPs]{.mark}** allows
technology to [**accomplish** a]{.mark} potentially **dangerous
[mission]{.mark}** [with **no requirement for physical human
presence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Beyond the inherent heartbreak
involved, the loss of human life also has implications for escalation.
[A recent study examined the different emotions generated from the loss
of an unmanned system versus a manned system, and its findings
demonstrate **[de-escalation advantages]{.mark}** from an **unmanned**
loss. In simple terms, the destruction of an unmanned system does not
generate the same visceral and escalatory response as the loss of a
human life.]{.underline} This vital difference adds flexibility
following a collision at sea or a hostile act during FONOPs. [While
[unmanned systems]{.mark} do not negate the potential for an escalation
spiral, their use [provide]{.mark}s [de-escalation options to
decision-makers that do not exist with manned platforms]{.mark}. As
geopolitical tensions continue to grow, [**opportunities** to
**decrease**]{.mark} potential **[escalation]{.mark}** spirals stemming
[from]{.mark} collisions during [FONOPs **should not be
ignored**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

An Asymmetric Response to Being Outnumbered

Much attention in recent years has focused on the impressive scope of
Chinese shipbuilding capabilities. In the waters of the South China Sea,
the U.S. Navy already finds itself outnumbered --- even more
significantly so when one includes the tremendous size and coercive
capabilities of the Chinese maritime militia. According to the 2020
annual Department of Defense report to Congress, China has built the
largest navy in the world, comprising 350 ships compared to the U.S.
Navy's 293 ships. This disparity exists primarily in smaller hull
classes and further emphasizes the benefit of using lower-cost unmanned
systems to even the numerical playing field. [The maxim that "quantity
has a quality all its own" will likely hold true in a dynamic
twenty-first century battlespace]{.underline}. As recent budget
submissions demonstrate, [[the]{.mark} U.S. **[Navy]{.mark}** simply
[does **not have the necessary capital** to match adversary
numbers]{.mark} at traditional major surface combatant shipbuilding
costs. Low-cost [**unmanned** systems]{.mark} will
**[facilitate]{.mark}** the [**dispersion** of]{.mark} the naval
[**assets necessary** to ensure]{.mark} the **[successful]{.mark}**
conduct of peacetime **[FONOPs]{.mark}**, while also enabling the
execution of the distributed maritime operations wartime concept. The
deployment of [**unmanned** systems]{.mark} to **counter** current
asymmetry [creates an **achievable** and **efficient option** to
**execute**]{.mark} assigned **missions**, such as [FONOPs]{.mark},
while countering increasing naval proliferation across the
globe.]{.underline}

Concerns Addressed

[The near-term extensive **use** of **unmanned** systems during FONOPs
**necessitates** both prudent **planning** and measured operational
**execution**. [The U.S. government should establish]{.mark} a favorable
[precedent for]{.mark} the legal status of [unmanned systems]{.mark}
under existing conventions and enforce suitable repercussions for
external interference with unmanned systems operating in accordance with
customary international law.]{.underline}

**[Setting a Precedent]{.underline}**

There is debate in legal circles over whether unmanned systems qualify
as warships --- a classification advantageous to the execution of
freedom of navigation missions. Unfortunately, any comprehensive
solution to this complex question will likely suffer due to the frayed
relationships in today's global environment, which make consensus
difficult. [With this obstacle in mind, the **[best path
forward]{.mark}** for ensuring **unmanned** systems' ability to conduct
operations in accordance with accepted standards [is]{.mark} through
**clear communication** of intent and routine usage across the
globe]{.underline}. Just as the U.S. government has relied on its
interpretation of convention provisions to dictate its actions around
the world and reinforce customary international law, [a transparent and
publicly accessible U.S. policy on [unmanned system use]{.mark} on the
seas could combine with at-sea operations to provide the necessary
foundation for global acceptance.]{.underline}

Unmanned Systems as the Platform of Choice for FONOPs

[By properly **executing** a transition to **[unmanned]{.mark}** system
**[FONOPs]{.mark}**, the United States can use technological advances to
**[ensure]{.mark}** a continuing **ability** to "**provide a [legal
order]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} will, among other things, [facilitate
peaceful]{.mark} international [uses of]{.mark} the [oceans]{.mark}."
Properly leveraged, **unmanned** systems will **execute** this
**mission** at a significant cost **savings**, with a **reduction** in
**risk**, and at a **scale needed** in a twenty-first century defined by
**great-power competition**.]{.underline}

**US presence is key to prevent Russia from restricting navigation
rights.**

Open Seas in the Arctic]{.underline},"

Last week, [[the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates** Navy [**sent
ships** into the **Barents Sea**]{.mark} for the first time since
2010]{.underline}. The U.S. Naval Forces Europe announced that [the
exercise was intended ["to **assert freedom of navigation** and
demonstrate seamless integration among allies." This was a **good first
step**]{.mark}.]{.underline} But four ships operating in an ice-free
Barents Sea will not reverse the decades of neglect and lack of
investment in the types of ships necessary for the United States to
protect its interests and those of its allies in the Arctic region.
Currently, its lack of investment in icebreakers and other types of
ships that can operate consistently and safely in ice-laden seas is
freezing the U.S. out of conversations about the Arctic Ocean. This lack
of investment has translated into U.S. diplomatic and military
reluctance to push back against Russia's expanded maritime Arctic
claims. As a result, the historic principle of mare liberum (freedom of
the seas) --- a bedrock of international norms since the Dutch jurist
Grotius conceived it --- may yield to a maritime "Iron Curtain," [[as
Russia]{.mark} restricts who and what can [travel through]{.mark} its
near [waters]{.mark}. To reverse this trend, [the **U.S.** must
immediately]{.mark} begin **[conducti]{.mark}ng** consistent **Freedom
of Navigation Operations** ([FONOPs]{.mark}) [in the **high
north**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Since 1983, [**U.S. policy** has been to **exercise**]{.mark} U.S.
ships to assert its [**navigation rights** and **freedoms**]{.mark} in a
manner **consistent** with the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the
Sea (**UNCLOS**), even though the U.S. is not a signatory to the
convention.]{.underline} Since that time, according to a Department of
Defense website, the United States Navy has conducted well over 400
FONOPs, countering the excessive maritime claims of some 60 nations. The
reasons stated for these FONOPs have ranged from rejection of
requirements that foreign warships not enter a territorial sea without
prior authorization, to rejecting baselines not drawn in accordance with
current laws and norms and attempts to restrict transit or innocent
passage through international straits. More recently the U.S. Navy has
used FONOPs to push back on new attempts to limit foreign vessels from
entering exclusive economic zones or attempts by China to create
artificial islands and then use these illegal constructs to serve as
justification for territorial sea claims[. As might be expected, a large
proportion of [**FONOPs** have been **conducted against authoritarian
nations**]{.mark}, such as China and Iran, [which **reject**]{.mark} a
free sea, or **[freedom]{.mark}** generally.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [**[until]{.mark}** the recent exercise in [the **Barents
Sea**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- which some experts have described as a
Passing Exercise (PASSEX) that did not seek to reject an expansive
maritime claim rather than a FONOP --- [[**no FONOPs** have been
**conducted** against **Russia**]{.mark} since the **1980s**. That is
true [despite]{.mark} the fact that Russia has advanced
[territorial]{.mark} sea [claims over the Arctic]{.mark} Ocean, and
attempted to activate Article 234 of UNCLOS, which permits coastal
states to exercise extraordinary precautionary management over
ice-covered waters.]{.underline}

This route, [the **northern sea route**, promises to **cut weeks** off
**passage** between Asia and Europe. It opened in August last year and
has remained open longer on average over the past decade, allowing
**millions** of **tons** of **cargo** to flow along the **shorter
route**.]{.underline} One emerging cargo of great importance to Putin's
Russia is the liquified natural gas (LNG) being produced at a large
plant on the Yamal Peninsula. Cash-strapped Russia is very interested in
shipping LNG to China's burgeoning energy market.

Of course, more is involved than just a shipping route.
[**[Warming]{.mark}** in the region [has **opened** the **Arctic**
Ocean]{.mark} to **oil, natural gas, and mineral-resource extraction**
from the sea floor. The Arctic Ocean also **possesses military value**,
as armed vessels and aircraft operating in the region have shorter
routes to vital targets in Europe and North America.
**[Russia]{.mark}**, through its various claims, [is attempting to
**cast** a]{.mark} wide [**net** of **sovereignty** over **all**
valuable **attributes** of the **region**]{.mark}. The **U.S.** position
on the Russian case is **critical**, as **all nations** that have Arctic
borders (the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Russia) could
financially and strategically **benefit** from the environmental
phenomenon.]{.underline}

[[**FONOPs benefit** the]{.mark} United States as well as the rest of
the [**international community** -- and enjoy **bipartisan support** in
**Washington**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Since its founding, the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** has
**protected [freedom of navigation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Of all lawful
uses of the oceans, [freedom of navigation has proven the most
[**critical** to]{.mark} American national [**security** by enabling the
global mobility of U.S. forces, and to U.S. economic prosperity]{.mark}
by facilitating free and open maritime commerce. What is more, [these
**benefits** are]{.mark} not singularly **[enjoyed]{.mark}** by the
United States but rather [by **all law-abiding
countries**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[**Threats** to freedom of navigation]{.mark} this past year [have been
**multiple**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including manifestly hostile and
life-threatening ones, such as terrorism against private shipping in the
Middle East and resurgent piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. But [[maritime
threats can]{.mark} also [be]{.mark} less visible yet equally
[**destructive** to **national** and **economic
security**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Among such threats to freedom of navigation are "**[excessive maritime
claims]{.mark}**"]{.underline} --- that is, foreign laws, proclamations,
or decrees that assert more control over the maritime environment than
allowed by international law. [These claims seek to **[restrict
navigation]{.mark}** and overflight rights or other lawful uses of the
seas.]{.underline} They can be restrictions on military exercises in
international waters, prohibitions on the transit of nuclear-powered
vessels, assertions of security authority beyond territorial sea limits,
or any number of other restrictions inconsistent with the law of the
sea.

[[By undermining the rules-based international order, these]{.mark}
illegitimate assertions of authority, born out of patent self-interest,
are [a **danger** to **international peace and
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As part of the rules-based order that
has benefited all nations since World War II, the 1982 [U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea (**[UNCLOS]{.mark}**) [**strikes** a]{.mark}
deliberate [**balance** between maritime control]{.mark} by coastal
states, on the one hand, [and **navigational freedoms** for all]{.mark},
on the other. From a defense perspective, [this]{.mark} balance
[decreases]{.mark} the risk of [military miscalculation]{.mark}, but [it
also promotes cooperation]{.mark} in other areas, like law enforcement,
scientific exploration, and commercial development]{.underline}. When a
nation asserts an excessive maritime claim that upsets this balance, it
promotes instability, which has negative economic and security
implications for the entire international community, including
land-locked nations. Acquiescence to these unlawful, excessive maritime
claims could, over time, erode the law and permanently infringe on all
nations' navigational rights and freedoms.

[[To **defend**]{.mark} these [**rights** and **freedoms**, the
**U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates** has **challenged unlawful
claims** of authority **over** the **oceans** through its **[Freedom of
Navigation Program]{.mark}** for over forty years.]{.underline} The
program is administered jointly by the U.S. Departments of State and
Defense. [The Department of State [leads **diplomatic efforts**
and]{.mark} formally [**objects** to foreign **actions inconsistent**
with]{.mark} customary **[international law]{.mark}**, while the
Department of Defense **exercises maritime rights and freedoms**
[through]{.mark} freedom of navigation operations, commonly referred to
as "**[FONOPs]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

Contrary to the views of some nations, [[**FONOPs**]{.mark} are **not
provocative** excursions intended to inflame regional tensions and
impose the United States' will on the rest of the world. Rather, they
[are **peaceful, routine operations** that **protest** excessive
**maritime claims**]{.mark}. By **adhering** to **international law** as
reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention, **[FONOPs]{.mark}** serve to
**[uphold]{.mark}** the rules-based [**order** on behalf of **all
nations**]{.mark} large and small, without regard to their naval
strength, economic prowess, or international partnerships. [They prompt
**diplomatic dialogues**]{.mark} and academic **conversations**
[about]{.mark} the **[law]{.mark} of the sea**, its limits, [and]{.mark}
its rights and [freedom]{.mark}s. [And]{.mark} they [**encourage** other
**nations** to **comply** with the law of the sea]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The program's success is due to its even-handed application of the law
against any excessive maritime claims, whether promulgated by allies,
partners, or competitors. [[This]{.mark} **consistent** and **principled
[approach]{.mark}**[, utilized by]{.mark} both [**Democratic** and
**Republican** administrations]{.mark} over the past four decades, has
been **[key]{.mark}** to the **legitimacy** of the program. A focus on
unlawful claims, rather than the claimants making them, also **assures**
that the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'** commitment to the [**rule
of law** will **transcend** any current **events** or
**crises**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In recent years, the United States has significantly expanded the scope
and frequency of its FONOPs. Globally, the United States challenged
twice the number of unlawful maritime claims in 2020 as it did in 2009.
In the South China Sea, a body of water that is home to the most
expansive and flagrant excessive maritime claims in the world, the
United States more than doubled its number of annual FONOPs from 2016 to
2020. The United States also challenged Russia's excessive maritime
claims in 2018 and 2020 --- the first time such operations have occurred
since the end of the Cold War.

[**Like-minded countries** have **taken notice**. [Other nations]{.mark}
that respect the law of the sea [have become]{.mark} more [**active** in
**pushing back diplomatically** against **excessive maritime
claims**]{.mark}, and [they are]{.mark} now [speaking with a **unified**
voice]{.mark}.]{.underline} The joint statement made in September 2020
by the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, for instance, sent a clear
and united message to China that UNCLOS is the legal framework within
which all activities in the oceans are governed. The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also issued its strongest statement in
recent memory, reaffirming the importance of upholding freedom of
navigation and of peacefully settling South China Sea maritime disputes
in accordance with the Convention. [[The **U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates** [should]{.mark} remain ready to **build** on this
international **support**, **encouraging partnership** opportunities and
**helping** other like-minded **nations establish** their own formal
**programs** that **support the law of the sea**.]{.underline}

[**[Excessive maritime claims will continue]{.mark}** testing the
resolve of the international community and its commitment to the rule of
law for the foreseeable future. To best defend the rules-based order,
[the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates** [must]{.mark} **continue**
the steady drumbeat of **global FONOPs** to **[support international
law]{.mark}** and **strengthen** our **relationships** [with]{.mark}
other nations. **Sustaining** the **scope** and **pace** of
**[FONOPs]{.mark}** that we have **achieved** over [the]{.mark} past few
years will not only **safeguard [U.S.]{.mark} national security, foreign
policy, and economic objectives** but [will make the **world** more
**secure** and more **prosperous** for all]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[**Rejecting excessive claims** to **waterways** that are **vital** to
international **commerce** is]{.mark} both an **[essential]{.mark}**
economic **interest** [for the **United States** and]{.mark} **vital**
[for **preserving**]{.mark} a rules-based international
**[order]{.mark}** on the High Seas.]{.underline} While the
international courts will determine the legitimacy of Russia's seabed
claims, there is no such pending arbitration for Russia's claim that the
NSR is an interior waterway and subject to their jurisdiction.
[Therefore, the **United States** should adopt a **policy** in the
**Arctic** to **deter Russia** from enforcing their **excessive**
maritime **claims** and to **reassure allies** that the US is committed
to preserving a rules-based order on the High Seas in the region. To
accomplish this goal, [the **United States** should]{.mark} **use** the
Coast Guard Polar Security Cutter (PSC) **icebreakers** currently under
construction to **[conduct]{.mark}** Freedom of Navigation Operations
(**[FONOP]{.mark}**) [within the **NSR**]{.mark}]{.underline} at a rate
of one per year. A FONOP is a naval operation where a United States Navy
or Coast Guard ship exercises its right of free passage through a
maritime zone with contested territorial status. Such exercises would
demonstrate American commitment to freedom of navigation in the Arctic,
reassure allies of our intent to contest Russian expansionism in the
region, and reaffirm international norms.

FONOPs are a unique policy tool because they require both domestic and
international authorization. Domestically, the President, the Department
of Defense, and the Department of Homeland security must draw from
constitutional and executive authority to justify the use of military
force in this way. The rationale for the President's authority to
command the Coast Guard and Navy to undertake a FONOP is found in
article 2, section 2 of the Constitution which grants the President the
powers of the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed forces.37 As
the Coast Guard is a military branch, albeit one normally under the
control of the Department of Homeland Security, the President's command
authority authorizes the executive to order them to conduct a FONOP.
[**Internationally**, the United States must be able to **justify** its
**claim** of an **excessive maritime jurisdiction** by a foreign power
for **the Freedom of Navigation Operation** to be considered
**legitimate** and **not** a form of military **aggression**. The
**rationale** for the **FONOP** can be found in the **UNCLOS treaty**
which states in Article 87 that [**states** have the **right**
to]{.mark} the same **freedom** of [**navigation** within a **national
EEZ**]{.mark} as they would on the High Seas.]{.underline}38 Further,
the Russian position states that the straits that access the NSR are
internal waterways rather than international straits. [A [FONOP]{.mark}
operation through these areas [relies on]{.mark} article 38 of [UNCLOS
which states]{.mark} that all [**vessels** have a **right** to
"**continuous and expeditious transit**]{.mark}," otherwise known as the
**right of transit passage**, [through **international
straights**]{.mark} connecting portions of the High Seas.]{.underline}
These two portions of the Conventions establish the legal case for
United States FONOPs under international law. Importantly, the United
States is a signatory, but the senate has not ratified UNCLOS due to
ongoing resistance from some Republicans about security and sovereignty
concerns. However, the US government does consider the UNCLOS treaty to
be "customary" international law and treats it in the same way as other
unratified executive agreements. 39 Despite not ratifying the treaty,
the United States does follow the law as laid down in UNCLOS and expects
the international community to abide by it. The idea of customary
international law, or jus cogens, is firmly embedded as a fundamental
principle of the international legal order.40 Russia and all other
Arctic nations have ratified the treaty. [[The]{.mark} operational
[**framework** to **conduct FONOPs** already **exists** within the
**DoD**]{.mark}. DoD Instruction S-2005.01 **establishes** the **FONOP**
program [and the **Navy produces** a]{.mark}n annual [**report** for
**congress** each year]{.mark} on the **FONOPS** conducted globally per
congressional reporting requirements.41 [**FONOPs** are **authorized**
and **conducted**]{.mark} under the executive's **constitutional
authority** [and **customary international law**]{.mark}. Functionally,
[authorizing **FONOPs** in the **NSR** is as **simple** as **adding**
the contested **territory** to the]{.mark} **Navy** and **Coast
Guard's** annual **[schedule]{.mark}** under this
**program**.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} PSC [**program** is **already funded** and the **FONOP**
would be part of the **normal**]{.mark} operating **[budget]{.mark}**
for the **ships assigned** to the mission. [This]{.mark} program [would
**not extend** any **additional costs** to the **government**]{.mark}
than are already built into the yearly budget.]{.underline} It is worth
noting that the PSC is far from a cheap program. At \$9.8B in total
lifecycle costs and \$2.6B per ship in design and production costs, the
program represents a significant investment for DHS. 45 As the Coast
Guard's two current icebreakers are likely to be retired following the
delivery of the ships, the opportunity costs associated with a single
month-long FONOP are high. These costs only expand when one considers
that the first FONOP would have to be followed by more for the policy to
have the intended effect. This would require at least one of only 3
American icebreakers that would otherwise be used to break for American
shipping or resupply at other Arctic missions.

[Given that the [**inputs** are]{.mark} relatively [**small** and **do
not introduce** any new **weapons**]{.mark} systems to the region that
we do not already have on station, **[FONOPs achieve]{.mark}** our
**goal** of **[deterrence without]{.mark}** precipitating an
**[arms]{.mark} [race]{.mark}** [in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, at
least in the short term. Though the Russians might respond by further
increasing armaments in the region, [[**FONOPs** represent the **least
militarized deterrence option** while still **achieving** the]{.mark}
policy **[goal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Though the Russians might respond
by increasing the military presence in the region, the United States
would not be the escalating party. [**[Promoting peace]{.mark}** in the
region [while also pushing back]{.mark} against Russian expansionism [is
a **key benefit**]{.mark} of the **FONOP** strategy over trying to match
Russia's military buildup in the region.]{.underline} However, given the
low monetary investment that FONOPs require, as discussed above, it also
grants the DoD flexibility to send more troops and equipment to the
region should the strategy prove fruitless, allowing the US to hedge its
bets without looking too aggressive.

[FONOPs also embolden our allies to take similar positions]{.underline}.
When the United States credibly demonstrates the capability to operate
in the Arctic, [[it will have the effect of **reassuring**]{.mark} our
[**allies** that we stand behind them if they **conduct similar
operations** and **adopt similar policies**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
this way, conducting FONOPs in the Arctic nest within the Biden
administration's larger goal to empower NATO to confront Russian
expansionism. Ultimately, legal arbitration in international courts does
not provide the forceful mechanism required to deter a state that has
shown its lack of regard for international institutions. Though FONOPs
in the Arctic may not force Russia to abandon their claims, it would
demonstrate their impotence to enforce them, essentially rendering them
moot in the eyes of our Arctic allies.

[Reconnaissance UAVs are a vital category of unmanned aerial vehicles
designed for information gathering]{.underline}. T[heir primary purpose
includes conducting aerial reconnaissance, collecting intelligence data,
monitoring objects and areas, and mapping terrain]{.underline}. These
devices enable real-time monitoring of various objects and processes,
which is critical for the safety and protection of the interests of both
governmental and private organizations \[17-18\]. The key
characteristics of reconnaissance UAVs vary depending on their intended
use and type. Their operational range can differ significantly: tactical
reconnaissance UAVs typically have a range of 70 to 200 km,
operational-tactical UAVs can reach 200 to 500 km, while strategic UAVs
may operate over distances exceeding 1500 km. Flight duration is also an
important factor; medium UAVs can typically remain airborne for 6 to 10
hours, while high-altitude long-endurance UAVs can stay in the air for
24 to 48 hours. The altitude at which these UAVs operate also varies:
low-altitude UAVs can fly at heights from 50 to 3000 m, mid-altitude
UAVs operate between 5000 and 8000 m, and high-altitude UAVs can ascend
to 20,000 m and beyond. Reconnaissance UAVs are equipped with various
sensors and equipment, such as electrooptical systems, infrared cameras,
radar stations, signals intelligence systems, and laser designators.
[These devices allow for the observation of a wide range of objects and
the collection of data necessary for situational analysis and
decision-makin]{.underline}g. The design of these UAVs typically follows
an aircraft configuration, which provides greater range and endurance.
Composite materials are used to reduce weight, and stealthy designs help
decrease their radar visibility, which is particularly important during
military operations. The communication systems in reconnaissance UAVs
provide secure data transmission channels and integrate multiple radio
channels across different frequency ranges. The use of energy-efficient
modulation types, such as BPSK and QPSK, maximizes communication range.
This enables effective real-time transmission of collected data, which
is critical for rapid responses to threats and changes in local
situations. In the Arctic, reconnaissance UAVs play an especially
important role, as they can conduct monitoring in extreme climatic
conditions and remote areas where traditional reconnaissance methods may
be ineffective or impossible. [Utilizing UAVs in this region allows for
the collection of data on ice conditions, ecosystem changes, and the
assessment of climate change impacts on Arctic nature]{.underline}.
[Their high maneuverability and capability to operate in strong winds
and low temperatures enable reconnaissance UAVs to monitor maritime
shipping, observe glacier movements, and investigate the state of Arctic
ecosystems]{.underline}. Additionally, they can be employed to oversee
activities in the Arctic region, which is increasingly relevant given
the rising geopolitical activity and interest in the resources located
in this unique and fragile area[. Thus, reconnaissance UAVs are becoming
indispensable tools in ensuring the security and sustainable development
of the Arctic]{.underline}. The Orlan-10 UAV is a Russian medium-range
drone that is actively used in various extreme conditions, including the
Arctic. This aircraft is designed for reconnaissance, monitoring,
mapping, and infrastructure surveillance. Due to its versatility and
adaptability to harsh climatic conditions, the Orlan-10 has become an
essential tool for Arctic expeditions and operations. The drone is used
for monitoring the ice cover, including assessing ice density, its
structure, and tracking the appearance of cracks and ice fields, which
is crucial for ensuring the safety of maritime navigation in Arctic
waters. Equipped with thermal imaging cameras and high-resolution
cameras, the Orlan-10 allows for precise measurements and the recording
of changes in the glacier zone, which is important for forecasting and
preventing accidents on sea routes \[19\]. In addition, the drone is
actively used for mapping and geodetic surveys, creating highly accurate
terrain maps and 3D models, which is vital for conducting scientific
research and planning infrastructure projects in the Arctic. In terms of
security and safety, the Orlan-10 is used for patrolling territories,
ensuring the safety of Arctic expeditions, and monitoring remote areas
where access is limited. In such conditions, the drone helps promptly
identify dangers such as changes in the ice situation or emergency
situations. The Orlan-10 is also used for environmental monitoring,
observing the condition of local ecosystems, flora, and fauna, as well
as assessing the impact of climate change on the Arctic environment. In
search-and-rescue operations, this UAV helps locate people in
hard-to-reach areas, thanks to its thermal imaging and high-resolution
cameras. In the Arctic, where low temperatures and severe weather
conditions limit traditional monitoring capabilities, the Orlan-10
ensures effective and safe operation, reducing risks and enhancing
operational efficiency. The Orlan-10 is a crucial tool for scientific
research, safety, and monitoring in the Arctic, and its technical
capabilities and resilience to extreme conditions make it indispensable
in this remote and challenging region.

climatic and ecological conditions of the region]{.underline}. They are
[designed to undertake]{.underline} a variety of tasks related to
[scientific research, monitoring, and data collection regarding
environmental conditions]{.underline}, which is particularly [pertinent
in light of climate change and ecosystem processes]{.underline} \[25\].
One of the [primary purposes of research UAVs is to gather data on
climate changes, such as temperature variations, radiation levels, and
the extent of glacier melting.]{.underline} These devices facilitate
comprehensive studies aimed at understanding the processes occurring in
the atmosphere, on the surface, and underwater. [Research UAVs can
collect data on air and ocean currents and observe changes in
ecosystems, including animal migration and vegetation
growth]{.underline}. Research UAVs are equipped with a range of sensors
and equipment, such as electrooptical systems, infrared cameras, radar
stations, and devices for measuring atmospheric parameters. This enables
them to effectively capture data on temperature, humidity, air
composition, and other critical indicators. Furthermore, [they can be
employed to monitor glacier conditions, collecting information on their
thickness, area, and melt rates, which is crucial for assessing the
impact of climate change on sea levels and ecosystems. Key
characteristics of research UAVs include their high maneuverability and
capability to operate in challenging climatic conditions. Their
operational range may vary from 200 to 1,500 kilometers, depending on
the type of device, while flight duration can reach 12 to 24 hours. This
allows them to cover significant areas and gather data in real time,
which is especially important for scientific
investigation]{.underline}s. Research UAVs can operate at various
altitudes, ranging from low (up to 3,000 meters) to high (up to 8,000
meters and beyond), enabling the exploration of different atmospheric
layers and their effects on climatic processes. They can also be
utilized for aerial surveys, facilitating the creation of high-quality
maps and models essential for scientific research. The design features
of research UAVs are adapted to the extreme conditions of the Arctic.
They often possess a lightweight yet robust structure that enables them
to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Composite materials and
low-observable shapes minimize their radar signature and extend flight
duration. The communication systems of research UAVs must ensure
reliable and secure data transmission. [The use of satellite systems and
secure radio channels maintains stable communication between UAVs and
ground stations, which is critical for the successful execution of
scientific tasks. In the Arctic, research UAVs assist scientists in
obtaining unique data necessary for understanding global climate changes
and their impact on ecosystems]{.underline}. They open new avenues for
scientific research, enabling comprehensive environmental monitoring and

[UAVs designed for data collection and transmission are specialized
devices intended for monitoring and analyzing various environmental
parameters in the harsh conditions of the Arctic]{.underline}. These
devices play a crucial role in studying ice cover, climate change, and
ensuring the safety of navigation and ecosystems in this region. Their
primary function involves the collection of data on air and water
temperatures, radiation levels, ice density and movement, as well as
other ecological parameters such as humidity, wind speed, atmospheric
pressure, and air composition. [This data is critical for predicting
climate changes and assessing environmental conditions, as it helps
identify trends and anomalies in the climate system while evaluating the
impact of human activities on Arctic ecosystems]{.underline}. These UAVs
are capable of recording data on glaciers, including their thickness and
area, which allows for monitoring the melting process and changes in ice
cover dynamics. Additionally, [these devices can be used to monitor
marine ecosystems, gathering information about seawater temperature and
salinity, as well as the distribution of plankton and other biological
components]{.underline}. This information is vital for understanding the
effects of climate change on marine flora and fauna and for developing
resource management strategies \[13-14\]. [Moreover, these UAVs can be
equipped with specialized sensors to analyze pollutants in the
atmosphere and water, facilitating the assessment of pollution levels
and sources]{.underline}. They are also capable of conducting
photographic and infrared imaging, which aids in vegetation studies,
ecosystem monitoring, and wildlife population assessments. All these
parameters collected via UAVs provide invaluable data for scientists,
researchers, and governmental agencies working in environmental
protection and climate change within the Arctic region. [UAVs for data
collection and transmission boast a high operational range, enabling
them to cover significant territories, with ranges varying from 100 to
2,000 kilometers depending on the model. This capability allows for
effective exploration of remote and inaccessible areas.]{.underline}
Their flight duration can extend from several hours to over 24 hours,
[facilitating longterm research and monitoring without the need for
frequent recharging or battery replacement]{.underline}. Typically, UAVs
operate at altitudes ranging from 100 to 5,000 meters, with the flight
height adjustable based on the specific tasks at hand. For instance,
altitude may be reduced for detailed observation of ice fields or
ecosystems. These UAVs can be outfitted with various sensors, including
high-resolution cameras, infrared and ultrasonic sensors, barometers,
thermometers, and other data collection devices, enabling comprehensive
environmental studies and providing precise data for analysis. The
devices often feature a robust design resistant to low temperatures,
strong winds, and other adverse weather conditions, utilizing special
materials to ensure reliability and durability in extreme environments.
Furthermore, UAVs are equipped with advanced communication systems that
allow real-time data transmission through satellite communication, radio
channels, and other technologies that ensure reliable connectivity even
in areas with limited coverage. Efficient communication systems enable
the transmission of data to control centers for subsequent analysis,
which is critically important for rapid response to changes in the
environment. The DJI Matrice 300 RTK showcases exceptional capabilities
for operating in the harsh conditions of the Arctic, making it an
indispensable tool for monitoring, research, and safety assurance in
this remote region. [With its modular design, resilience to extreme
weather, and highly accurate RTK navigation system, the drone enables
efficient data collection in environments characterized by low
temperatures, strong winds, and limited visibility]{.underline} \[15-
16\]. One of the drone's primary functions is ice monitoring. Equipped
with LiDAR and highresolution cameras, it generates 3D maps of ice
formations, capturing their density, movement, and cracks. [This
information is crucial for navigation, as it helps define safe routes
and predict hazardous areas]{.underline}. Thermal imaging sensors
enhance its ability to analyze ice structures, including hidden
cavities, making it invaluable for both research and ensuring the safety
of expeditions. The drone also plays a significant role in Arctic
ecological research. The DJI Matrice 300 RTK can be outfitted with
sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and air composition, as well
as multispectral cameras for monitoring water conditions and detecting
pollution. These capabilities assist scientists in studying the impact
of climate change on Arctic ecosystems. For example, analyzing carbon
dioxide and methane emissions provides insights into the dynamics of
greenhouse gases and their influence on global warming processes.
Ensuring maritime safety is another critical application of this
technology. [Operating in real-time, the drone transmits data on weather
conditions, wind speeds, and ice coverage, helping ship captains avoid
dangerous situations]{.underline}. High-zoom cameras and thermal sensors
allow for long-range observation of ice conditions, significantly
reducing risks during navigation. Additionally, [the drone is
extensively used for tracking animal migrations and studying ecosystems.
Through non-invasive data collection]{.underline}, the DJI Matrice 300
RTK minimizes disruption to the natural habitats of Arctic species such
as seals and polar bears. Thermal imaging makes it possible to monitor
their movements even in low visibility or nighttime conditions.

Marine and [underwater UAVs]{.underline} [play a **crucial
role**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the [research and monitoring of
Arctic waters]{.underline}, [where conditions can be extremely harsh and
inaccessible]{.underline}. These [devices are designed]{.underline}
**[to perform various tasks]{.underline}** related to the investigation
of marine ecosystems, [**environmental** monitoring, **search and
rescue** operations, and **military applications**]{.underline} \[23,
24\]. [Marine UAVs]{.underline} are unmanned aerial vehicles capable of
conducting operations over water. They can be utilized for monitoring
the marine environment, including [collect]{.underline}ing
[data]{.underline} [on water temperature]{.underline}, [salinity,
pollution levels, and biodiversity]{.underline}. [Equipped with various
sensors and cameras, marine UAVs can detect changes in ecosystems, study
marine animal populations, and monitor ice conditions while forecasting
ice movements. This capability is **particularly relevant**]{.underline}
in the context of climate change[, as the Arctic environment undergoes
**significant alterations**]{.underline}. Key characteristics of marine
UAVs include high maneuverability and resilience to adverse weather
conditions. They can operate over distances ranging from 100 to 500
kilometers and remain airborne for 6 to 12 hours. Some models feature
vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, making them especially
convenient for operations in challenging conditions where suitable
landing sites are unavailable. These [UAVs are often equipped with
communication systems that enable real-time data
transmission]{.underline}, which is [crucial for timely responses to
changing situations.]{.underline} Underwater UAVs are specifically
designed to operate submerged. They are employed for [exploring the
seafloor, monitoring the status of underwater ecosystems, conducting
geophysical research, and mapping the seabed]{.underline}. Underwater
UAVs can [collect data regarding the condition of the seabed, depth,
soil composition]{.underline}, and the presence of resources such as oil
and gas, making them indispensable for resource exploration. The main
features of underwater UAVs include autonomy and the ability to operate
at great depths. They can dive to depths of up to 6,000 meters and
remain submerged for several days while performing data collection
tasks. These UAVs are also outfitted with various sensors, such as
sonars and cameras, which provide information about the seafloor and
underwater objects. In the Arctic, marine and underwater UAVs hold
particular significance due to the complexities of research operations
and the necessity of obtaining data about rapidly changing environments.
These devices can perform tasks such as [assessing glacier conditions,
investigating changes in marine ecosystems, and monitoring pollution and
resource status]{.underline}. Their application can substantially reduce
the time and resources required for research and monitoring while
enhancing operational safety, as UAVs can function in conditions that
may be hazardous to human personnel. Manta Ray is an autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) specifically designed for missions in
challenging marine and Arctic conditions. It is used for researching
underwater ecosystems, monitoring ice shelves, assessing the condition
of the seafloor, and collecting data on climate change, which is crucial
for understanding the impact of global warming on the Arctic. In Arctic
conditions, Manta Ray plays a key role in monitoring underwater
conditions and ice cover. It helps explore various parameters of the
marine environment, such as water temperature, salinity, current speed,
and the composition of underwater ecosystems. It can also be used to
study subglacial lakes, which are important objects for studying climate
change and its impact on the marine and ice environment. Manta Ray has a
number of technical features that make it suitable for operation in
harsh Arctic conditions. It boasts long autonomy, allowing for
continuous research and monitoring in remote areas where access is
limited. With its flexibility in tasks and equipped with various
sensors, such as those for collecting water composition data, measuring
depth, and temperature, Manta Ray can perform environmental monitoring
and gather key data. The underwater drone also has high mobility,
enabling it to operate under ice, exploring areas that are inaccessible
to traditional submarines and other equipment. This allows monitoring of
ice shelf conditions, their changes, and potential cracks, which is
crucial for predicting ice-related catastrophes. Manta Ray can also
collect data on seafloor geology, investigating its structure and
composition, which is especially important for scientific expeditions in
the Arctic, where underwater geophysical research can reveal information
about climate change. In the Arctic, this drone is used to study the
condition of ice cover, tracking the dynamics of ice melt and observing
the state of ice shelves, which helps predict changes and their impact
on global sea levels. It also enables monitoring of marine flora and
fauna, which allows for assessing the impact of climate change on
biodiversity. Manta Ray is actively used in subglacial research,
studying hard-to-reach subglacial lakes and other underwater objects
that provide unique information on geological and climate processes.
Furthermore[, the drone is used to assess pollution impacts, such as
oil, in Arctic waters, where protecting ecosystems from anthropogenic
impacts is critically important]{.underline}.

Opportunities for Decisionmakers

[The [fallout from]{.mark} the [COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic [will
introduce unique fiscal challenges]{.mark}, including a worldwide
decline in military spending]{.underline}.47 During this period of rapid
change, [[Russia, China, the United States, and NATO allies will assert
their territorial, economic, and military
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore,
a pivotal [[time to support]{.mark} affordable and [persistent satellite
capabilities for comm]{.mark}unicatio[ns]{.mark}, [connectivity,
navigation, and observation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [space enterprise can start
by]{.underline} considering the following opportunities:

[Emphasize open, available, and shared systems for multi-partner
cooperation]{.underline}. Commercial [[**satellite** **services**
**offer open and readily available systems** for]{.underline}]{.mark}
responding to missions that require [[multinational
interoperability]{.mark}, and multistakeholder cooperation]{.underline}.

Open solutions. [The Air Force Arctic Strategy calls for greater
investments in areas such as C3ISR, space operations, and missile
defense. Beyond secure and protected defense-focused satellite systems,
[more open and available systems are needed for emergency
response]{.mark}]{.underline}. These missions require joint,
multi-national capabilities to prepare and respond to large-scale
disasters (natural and man-made), coordinate readiness with allies and
partners, and plan for rescue and personal recovery.48

[Ready access]{.underline}. Defense systems often require 15- to 20-year
acquisition cycles. [Decisionmaking and design/production processes
alone can [take 5 years]{.mark}]{.underline}, on average, [[to
mature]{.mark} a concept]{.underline}, gain stakeholder validated
requirements[, [and establish]{.underline}]{.mark} [[an acquisition
program]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[another 7.5
years]{.underline}]{.mark}, on average, [[to]{.mark} reach first
[launch]{.mark}]{.underline}.49,50 [By contrast, [contracting]{.mark}
[with a commercial space provider to develop and operate]{.mark}
communications, navigation, and [remote sensing services could entail
**a couple of years**]{.mark}]{.underline} instead of close to a decade,
which is the amount of time government programs often need.51

[Optimize networks, data sharing, and cloud connectivity]{.underline}.
Arctic sta[keholders can optimize communication paths through network
convergence and interoperability standards]{.underline}. Enterprise
cloud connectivity for polar region customers (commercial, civil, and
military users) will also drive efficiencies and allow remote Arctic
business locations and operations to become more integrated and central.

[Update the U.S. relationship with our Arctic allies to integrate an
evolving Arctic Strategy.]{.underline} [The United States has a unique
relationship with Canada for mutual deterrence, defense, and space
operations]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} now a propitious [[time to
update our space alliances and partnerships to address the new Air Force
Arctic Strategy]{.mark}, including optimizing combined space
capabilities, [exploring new surveillance]{.mark} and communication
capabilities (including commercial solutions), and updating regional
infrastructure]{.underline}. Canada's combined space operations with the
United States includes Sapphire orbital space surveillance and RADARSAT
Earth observation. As a partner, Canada participates with the United
States in the following programs: Space Situational Awareness (SSA);
Wideband Global SATCOM; North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)
Command, and missile warning, maritime warning, and positioning,
navigation and timing capabilities.52 To ensure that our longstanding
relationship with our northern neighbor remains strong, the United
States and Canada should jointly operate all domain Arctic awareness for
security and stability applications.53 The United States should continue
to promote and expand the enduring defense relationship with Canada via
NORAD and bolster strategic messaging to enhance deterrence. On the
civil front, the Alaska Domain Awareness Center (ADAC) works as a
collaboration hub for safety, security, and crisis response and should
be further resourced.

[Engage and incentivize the commercial sector]{.underline}. [Expanding
commercial space capabilities [can provide the rapid access, reach, and
domain awareness to advance our political, economic, national
security]{.mark}, environmental, [and]{.mark} cultural [interests as an
Arctic nation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now is the time for policymakers to
examine how government can encourage commercial ventures, perhaps as a
committed customer, anchor tenant, or seed investor, to support critical
mission areas and to improve the lives of the people in the Far North
region.

Looking Forward

[[The]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} region [will]{.mark} continue to [grow in
strategic importance]{.mark} for commercial, national security, and
environmental interests]{.underline} at a time when space assets are
poised to respond to a range of challenges and needs across private
sector, civil, and defense interests. [[This is a unique time in the
space sector]{.mark} as commercial space is proving its resilient
capacity [to]{.mark} provide open and hybrid architectures across a
range of orbital regimes.]{.underline} Emerging ubiquitous networking
[options]{.underline} and open data sharing will [[usher in a new age of
greater persistence, transparency, and cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
By strengthening our international Arctic partnerships, particularly
with Canada, and fully leveraging our commercial satellite-based
assets[, [the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [S]{.mark}tates [can]{.mark}
build Arctic awareness, [enhance]{.mark}]{.underline} Arctic

region.](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/new-strategy-arctic-china-russia-cooperation/)]{.underline}

["[A]{.mark} key [focus]{.mark} ... [is]{.mark} championing investments
that will [enhance]{.mark} [our]{.mark} [awareness]{.mark} of threats
[in]{.mark} the region,"]{.underline} Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Arctic and Global Resilience Iris Ferguson told reporters
July 22. "We want to make sure that we have the [[right]{.mark}
[sensing]{.mark} [architecture]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[right]{.mark} [communications]{.mark} architecture for command and
control]{.underline}." 

Since 2020, the Department of the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy have
all released [[Arctic]{.mark} strategies [[calling for more
investment]{.mark}](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-to-increase-arctic-investment/) in
the region]{.underline}, and former U.S. Northern Command boss Gen. Glen
D. VanHerck
[and [others](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/dod-leaders-increased-arctic-funding-not-right-now/) have [noted
a lack of funding for domain
awareness](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/arctic-past-pentagon-budgets-vanherck-2023/)]{.underline}.
 

Those concerns gained prominence in early 2023 when a [[Chinese spy
balloon flew over the
U.S.]{.underline}](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/norad-missed-previous-chinese-spy-balloons-a-domain-awareness-gap-we-have-to-figure-out/) and
Canada, including time near the Aleutian islands. More recently, new
NORTHCOM commander Gen. Gregory M. Guillot revealed in March that
[[Russian bombers [approached American
airspace](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/norad-boss-russian-bombers-china-us/)]{.mark} from
the northeast for the first time in two years]{.underline}. He also
warned that the [[Chinese]{.mark} are [likely]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[send]{.mark} [warplanes]{.mark}]{.underline} near Alaska as soon as
this year. 

"[The [Arctic is]{.mark} perhaps the [shortest]{.mark} and
[least]{.mark} [defended]{.mark} threat [vector]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[North]{.mark} [America]{.mark}, and that's what makes it so
important]{.underline}," Guillot's deputy, Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Carden,
said July 23 at an event hosted by the Wilson Center. 

With [[Russia and China cooperating]{.mark} more and more [in]{.mark}
the [Arctic]{.mark}, the [U.S]{.mark}. [needs]{.mark} [better]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology and infrastructure [to]{.mark} [sense]{.mark}
[threats]{.mark} and communicate them,]{.underline} officials say. Much
of the infrastructure in place dates back to the Cold War, and the harsh
conditions of the region take a toll on both buildings and equipment. 

"It's not like those sensors can exist in the Arctic, without some
hardened, climate-controlled infrastructure," said Carden. "You know, I
spent a lot of time early in my career training for operations in the
desert, and we used to have a say, 'Life's hard in the desert.' I'll
tell you, life is harder in the Arctic, and we're learning that very
quickly."

Installations like Pituffik Space Base are slated to get millions of
dollars to modernize, Ferguson said. Meanwhile, the [[DOD]{.mark} is
also [eyeing]{.mark} [sensors]{.mark} [that]{.mark} can [handle]{.mark}
the [conditions]{.mark}---and make it such that human operators don't
have to brave them as much.]{.underline} 

"[[Domain]{.mark} [awareness]{.mark} missions are well [suited]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} uncrewed [systems]{.mark} approaches [in]{.mark}
[all]{.mark} [domains]{.mark}, so sensing missions, ISR,]{.underline}
etc.," Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen H. Hicks told reporters July
22. "So this is a clear area where we can apply some of what we're doing
in the department. The features we're looking for there are endurance,
not putting humans at risk in a harsh environment. But at the same time
... [you have to ensure that even those uncrewed systems are survivable
long enough at least to endure or are so inexpensive, that their
attritable nature is still worth it for the mission you're putting them
on. So that means a lot of research and development and testing, and
that's where we're focused in this area." ]{.underline}

[[Space]{.mark} also [features]{.mark} [prominently]{.mark} in the new
strategy, [with]{.mark} mentions of [possible]{.mark} new
[missile]{.mark} [warning/missile tracking, communications]{.mark},

of commercial satellites. ]{.underline}

[more]{.mark} polar-specific [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. DOD will
work on those systems, while also trying to leverage partnerships to
keep costs down, officials said. 

"[It's an area that we haven't invested in to date]{.underline} as much
because of the inclination of our geosynchronous orbits," Ferguson said.
"[[We]{.mark} [have]{.mark} [to]{.mark} actively [invest]{.mark}

Introduction

[Over the past two decades]{.underline}, and [especially
since]{.underline} Russia's invasion of **[Ukraine]{.underline}** in
2022, [the [Arctic]{.mark} has become]{.underline} increasingly
[characterized by **[competition]{.mark}** rather than
**cooperation**]{.underline}.1 As described by Icelandic Prime Minister
Bjarni Benediktsson in October 2024, "whether we like it or not, [the
Arctic [is]{.mark} fast becoming a theater of **global competition** and
**militarization**]{.underline}, and it is up to us to determine the
parameters for developing this region."2 The Arctic security environment
has changed politically, reflective of an increasingly competitive
posture between a consolidated NATO bloc in the West and a belligerent
Russia in the East.

Prominent among the political challenges facing NATO allies in the
Arctic is addressing these changes materially. The issue is
comprehensive and involves combining means in order to underpin
deterrence---of both warfare and gray-zone actions---as well as to
prepare for potential warfighting scenarios. In responding to these
challenges, [Arctic states have [an opportunity to]{.mark}]{.underline}
learn from, and [[leverage, lessons from Ukraine]{.mark} on]{.underline}
the role of **[tech]{.underline}**nological development [in
**contemporary warfare**]{.underline}.

[The Ukrainian battlefield]{.underline} has [illustrated]{.underline}
the [strengths and limitations of]{.underline} several rapidly
**[evolving tech]{.underline}**nologies [impacting]{.underline} the
character [of]{.underline} warfare. While some technological solutions
have provided robust military advantages (e.g., the Starlink
constellation) others have been caught in action-reaction cycles where
advantages have been quickly neutralized by the adversary (e.g., certain
configurations of drones or precision-guided artillery).3 These lessons
are already influencing the strategies and force postures of Arctic
states, including Russia.4

[Any response to]{.underline} the changing [[Arctic
security]{.underline}]{.mark} environment [[requires]{.mark} addressing
several key concerns]{.underline}. The first is analyzing the
vulnerabilities that impede the ability of Arctic states to credibly and
capably both deter and fight in the High North. At least partially [due
to]{.underline} the [absence of an independent]{.underline} command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (**[[C4ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [capability,
**[situational awareness]{.mark}** is a vulnerability]{.underline} of
particular significance.5 [[Arctic states]{.mark} are]{.underline}
instead [[depend]{.mark}ent [on vulnerable **undersea
communications**]{.mark}]{.underline} infrastructure, [[or
**space**]{.mark}**-based** [capabilities that are]{.mark} **relatively
[scarce]{.mark}**]{.underline} and characterized by intra-alliance
dependency on the United States.6 Additionally, Europe's reliance on
Norway as an energy provider is vulnerable to Russian gray-zone
tactics.7

The second concern is addressing these vulnerabilities, taking stock of
which technological capabilities will make a difference and how lessons
from the war in Ukraine can be efficiently applied to strategy and force
postures. The most immediate priority to alleviate Arctic security
concerns should be bolstering maritime domain awareness in the region,
which directly impacts European energy security as well as nuclear
security and deterrence by enhancing NATO's ability to detect, monitor,
and respond to potential threats. Ukraine has demonstrated the utility
and resiliency of advanced space capabilities and unmanned systems when
used in nonpermissive environments. [As Arctic geography]{.underline}
already [creates dependency on satellites, [investing in **space
capabilities** should be a **main priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, certain configurations of unmanned systems can
cost-efficiently bolster both situational awareness and offensive
options in Arctic security.

The Utility of Situational Awareness in the Arctic

Harnessing benefits from technological development is particularly
important given the ongoing geopolitical changes in the Arctic. [Growing
[tension between **NATO** and **Russia** is]{.mark} likely to lead [to
**increase**]{.mark}**d [naval activity]{.mark}** in the High North,
[where **vulnerable**]{.mark} military, communications, and energy
[infrastructure is **at risk of sabotage**]{.mark} and
interference]{.underline}. While China is unlikely to establish a
significant presence in the Arctic, [monitoring Chinese maritime
traffic]{.underline} and their potential activities in building C4ISR
ground infrastructure [remains important]{.underline}.8 [Monitoring
Russian]{.underline} activity around its [nuclear]{.underline} deterrent
[posture has been of particular consequence]{.underline} since the
beginning of the war in Ukraine---in September 2024, Russian president
Vladimir Putin announced changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine involving
an "expansion" of its mission, although any substantial differences are
yet to be revealed.9

The White House has already identified C4ISR capabilities as essential
to its Arctic ambitions. Reflecting its "monitor-and-respond" global
posture as outlined in its National Defense Strategy, the United States
asserts a general readiness to respond to threats in the Arctic along
with its regional allies, yet highlights two focal points: the Arctic
(1) houses various early-warning and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and (2) acts as the U.S. northern
flank in carrying out Indo-Pacific operations.10 In the strategy's
implementation plan, the first strategic objective is improving the
understanding of the Arctic operating environment, particularly
emphasizing the bolstering of space capabilities and maritime domain
awareness.11

[[The **strategic utility**]{.mark} of an Arctic presence [is
considerable for **early warning**]{.mark} purposes. [Its]{.mark}
**geographical [location]{.mark}** [makes the Arctic an **important
vantage point**]{.mark} for [monitoring]{.mark} potential ballistic
**[missile launches]{.mark}** and]{.underline} other [airborne
threats]{.underline}.12 [[Russia and the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates---with its allies---[[depend
on]{.mark} Arctic [infrastructure for]{.mark} their [early
warning]{.mark}]{.underline} systems, both [[through
**ground**]{.mark}**-based** [radars and]{.mark} **ground
[stations]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} satellite communications
(**[[SATCOM]{.underline}]{.mark}**). Russia and China are increasingly
collaborating in developing defense technology, decidedly prioritizing
space and new technologies, and it is with Russia's cooperation that
China is seeking to develop and deploy its own early warning
infrastructure.13

More broadly, [with]{.underline} their [increasing dependence on
space-based capabilities]{.underline} for advanced warfare, [states
seeking global or Arctic]{.underline} regional [coverage]{.underline}
for their space systems [are **reliant on ground infrastructure** in the
Arctic [due to its **latitude-restricting
coverage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.14 [[The Arctic is also an **ideal
location** for this]{.mark} type of
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Particularly for states with
ambitions of global space-power projection such as the United States and
China, this incentivizes a growing physical presence in the Arctic to
support developing space infrastructure, including dual-use projects.15
China has advanced its global space capabilities drastically in recent
years, and reports have emerged that Russia is becoming reliant on
Chinese satellite imagery of Ukraine.16 Moreover, the geopolitical
tension between NATO and Russia heightens the risk for assets such as
Norway's K-SAT satellite station on Svalbard and the space-launch
capabilities in Andøya, Norway, and Kiruna, Sweden.17

### Solv\-\--US Drones Fail

#### The West lacks the technology to field arctic drones.

Jacob **Gronholt-Pedersen and** Gwladys **Fouche 1/30**/25 Copenhagen
bureau chief, Reuters and Oslo Bureau Chief, Deputy Bureau Chief for the
Nordics "'We're all having to catch up': NATO scrambles for drones that
can survive the Arctic" Reuters
https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-scrambles-drones-that-can-survive-arctic-2025-01-30/

The United States, which sees the Arctic as crucial for territorial
defence and its early warning system against nuclear attacks, said in a
July strategy document it would focus on unmanned technology to counter
Chinese-Russian collaboration there. Russian and Chinese bomber planes
flew together off the coast of Alaska in July and their coast guard
ships sailed together through the Bering Strait in October.

But [drones]{.underline} -- whether multicopters or fixed wing models --
**[are vulnerable]{.underline}**. [Only the largest, long-range models
have enough power for anti-icing systems like those used by aircraft.
Cold, fog, rain or snow can cause a malfunction or crash.]{.underline}

With countries boosting military spending, a Reuters survey of 14
companies and six defence ministries and armed forces in northern Europe
and America shows the industry working at pace to buy or develop drones
that can endure icy conditions, and increasing urgency among NATO states
to acquire them."We are all having to catch up with Ukraine and Russia,"
said General Major Lars Lervik, head of the Norwegian Army.

No global data is publicly available on states' military drone fleets,
but Lervik said the war in [Ukraine has given Moscow]{.underline} and
Kyiv valuable [experience of drone technology]{.underline} that [NATO
countries lack.]{.underline}

[Russia]{.underline}, whose military [began building up a drone fleet in
the Arctic in 2014]{.underline}, **[took an early lead]{.underline}** in
the race [to control the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}, a passage
between Europe and Asia along Russia's northern coast, said James Patton
Rogers, a drone expert at Cornell University and a UN and NATO policy
adviser.

Russia's Zala Aero, part of the Kalashnikov Group, already offers drones
designed for extreme Arctic conditions and Russia has also said its
long-range S-70 Okhotnik combat drone can operate at minus 12 Celsius
and will be deployed there.

"We're moving towards a point where [Russia will not only have unarmed
**surveillance** drone systems along the Northern Sea Route, but
potentially **armed systems** that are constantly patrolling those areas
as well]{.underline}," said Rogers.

He said NATO had been slow to devise a coherent response. NATO said it
has strengthened its presence in the Arctic and set up a new  Command to
keep Atlantic lines free and secure; NATO states are investing in new
air and maritime capabilities.

The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment on
that but said in an email the U.S. would continue to prioritise security
in the Western Hemisphere and its presence in the Arctic.

The U.S. has already invested heavily in long-range drones to monitor
and gather real-time information from the Arctic -- a vast region where
radar and satellite coverage are limited. These craft can operate at
lower altitudes for surveillance, but if they do they face the same risk
of icing as smaller models.

[The risk to drones is highest in temperatures just either side of
freezing -- between 8 degrees and minus 10 degrees Celsius]{.underline},
according to drone pilots and experts. [A thin layer of ice forms on
propellers and wings and **destroys the aerodynamic**]{.underline}.

### AT: FONOPs

#### Status Quo FONOPs are aggressive and hurt India's confidence in security

Kim **Heriot-Darragh**, 04 **2024**, Research Fellow at the Australia
India Institute, "FONOPS Send a Message -- But They Don't Speak for
Themselves", The Interpreter,
<https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/fonops-send-message-they-don-t-speak-themselves>.

[The Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) program run by the US
Department of Defense has become a symbol of China-US naval
competition]{.underline} and of the West's advocacy for a rules-based
order. [Operational assertions are thrust into the limelight whenever
China responds to one. And barely any US statement goes by without
reference to freedom of navigation and global norms]{.underline}.

That's a problem. [FONOPs were only ever meant to uphold narrow
principles with select audiences in mind. Those principles uphold the
right of all navies to operate in the world's waters
unimpeded]{.underline}. A core [audience]{.underline} since the program
was established in 1979 has been foreign governments that [may dispute
the US stance on those rights but at least had context for the
debate]{.underline}. To them FONOPs are often an irritation, not a
serious problem.

[But that audience has expanded. Commentators, journalists and officials
have more reason to monitor maritime developments because they're so
central to Indo‑Pacific security]{.underline}. They mightn't have
expertise in arcane aspects of international law. But their voices
matter deeply in shaping their country's attitude to the United States
-- especially in democracies.

It wouldn't hurt for America to more-consistently highlight when other
countries exercise their navigation rights off its own coast, and to be
clearer that that freedom of navigation rights exist beyond the UNCLOS
framework.

[Some of them will view FONOPs through an intuitive rather than legal
lens. **Warships can be imposing**.]{.underline} Sailing close by
uninvited can appear like attempted intimidation -- especially if
histories of colonialism and gunboat diplomacy are at play. [FONOPs are
easily perceived as the **antithesis** of the rules-based order that
America seeks to uphold, **muddying** the distinction between its
behaviour and China's]{.underline}.

We've seen what happens when operational assertions occur without
helpful messaging. In April 2021, a terse US Navy press release
announced that the USS John Paul Jones "[asserted navigational rights
and freedoms ... inside India's exclusive economic zone, **without**
requesting India's prior **consent**]{.underline}," [adding that the
operation challenged "India's excessive maritime claims]{.underline}."

India's foreign policy community responded with nuance, and neither side
allowed the incident to distract from higher priorities. But the
statement prompted outcry from some commentators who seemed unaware that
the United States had been conducting such operations for decades.

[At least four unhelpful themes]{.underline} emerged publicly.

First, ordinary people -- in any country -- could be forgiven for not
distinguishing between foreign navies operating in their EEZ or in
territorial waters. Countries have sovereignty over the latter, not the
former. But to laypeople, [a foreign warship operating in either can
sound like an affront]{.underline}.

\<\<\<\<Image removed\>\>\>\>

[Second, the global view of the United States doesn't automatically
translate locally]{.underline}. For Washington's program to work, it
must uphold the rules everywhere, not just where it's convenient. But
[most countries are pragmatically focused on their immediate region.
They don't have the resources, reach and desire to sail the globe to
underscore their right to do so. When America reaches out to touch their
maritime zones from the other side of the world, it can appear
**targeted**]{.underline} -- not routine. It's no surprise that some
Indian commentators looked for political messaging behind the US navy's
statement; [one speculated it may partly relate to American displeasure
over India's relationship with Russia]{.underline}.

Third, [some reactions revealed an assumption that the United States
reserves FONOPs for countries that aren't its closest
partners]{.underline}. Prominent [Indian opposition figure Shashi
Tharoor]{.underline} [implied]{.underline} that [America]{.underline}
[didn't]{.underline} [conduct FONOPs]{.underline} against countries such
as Australia because they are formal allies -- not [because their
maritime stances are largely aligned]{.underline}. More than one analyst
told me that even if America could legally conduct FONOPs in India's
EEZ, its relationship with India meant that it shouldn't. It should
focus on China. [Few seemed convinced that FONOPs were about rules
rather than power]{.underline}.

Finally, [the United States was accused of hypocrisy]{.underline}. This
is familiar: [Washington's reticence to join]{.underline} the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ([UNCLOS) is often seen to
undermine its credibility to uphold maritime rights]{.underline}.
Further, one senior military officer from South Asia asked me: Could I
imagine how America would react if China entered its maritime zones? It
does, and with no objection.

The answer to some of this is straightforward: [the United States
needs]{.underline} a good website. Offerings such as the State
Department's Limits of the Seas site provide valuable legal analysis for
specialists. But they don't [help laypeople demystify FONOPs,
which]{.underline} for the United States [are]{.underline} one of the
most visible -- and [potentially **provocative**]{.underline} -- means
of upholding international law.

Government statements can assert the relevant principles, but still
emphasise that the program doesn't diminish America's regard for its
partners. And they can still pro-actively tackle common misperceptions
about FONOPs. [It wouldn't hurt for America]{.underline} to
more-consistently highlight when other countries exercise their
navigation rights off its own coast, and [to be clearer that that
freedom of navigation rights exist beyond the UNCLOS
framework]{.underline}. Supporting them without having joined the treaty
isn't as hypocritical as some assume.

[Indo-Pacific states have good historic reasons to be cautious about
external powers. Their perceptions of US foreign and strategic policy
are shaped by their strong focus on practical issues -- as well as
diverse cultural assumptions about law's role in strategy and national
power]{.underline}. Advocating a rules-based order requires clarity
about exactly what rules America is promoting -- and a willingness to
consider whether the message is landing with important audiences.

[FONOPs should]{.underline} be about more than ticking legal boxes. They
are an opportunity for America to persuade, [not just
assert]{.underline}.

#### FONOPs are ineffective

Legal Logics of a U.S. Navy FONOP in the Canadian or Russian Arctic",

[The Arctic's growing maritime significance may lead the United States
to consider conducting a Freedom of Navigation operation (FONOP) in the
Arctic straits]{.underline}. [In 2018]{.underline}, then-[Secretary of
the Navy]{.underline} Richard V. Spencer [called for FONOPs in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Schreiber, 2019). [In 2021]{.underline}, as the
Trump administration ended, then-Secretary of the Navy [Kenneth
Braithwaite likewise pushed for FONOPs]{.underline} in the Arctic
against Russian claims, both in the Barents Sea near the Kola Peninsula
and, eventually, along the Russian Arctic straits (McCleary, 2021).

[Despite these developments, FONOPs would be ineffective challenges
against Russian claims and of partial use against Canadian claims. This
is because U.S. FONOPs are conducted by government vessels, which are
exempt from many navigation restrictions in the Arctic.]{.underline}

First, this article discusses the U.S. government's Freedom of
Navigation program's legal effects. It then explores what current
Canadian and Russian claims and laws mean for commercial and government
vessels navigating in Arctic passages. The article concludes by
scrutinizing these restrictions to determine the viable legal targets
for a U.S. Arctic FONOP.

Freedom of Navigation operations

[To defend its interpretation of the law of the sea, the United States
has coupled diplomatic protest with operational assertions of rights
constrained by coastal states since the 1970s]{.underline}. The Freedom
of Navigation (FON) program [combines diplomatic and military actions to
"preserve and enhance navigational freedoms" necessary for U.S. maritime
mobility]{.underline}, as well as to reinforce recognition of the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea's (UNCLOS) navigational components
(Roach & Smith, 1994: 3--4). In conjunction with diplomatic protest and
consultations, the United States conducts Freedom of Navigation
operations (FONOPs)---operational assertions of various maritime rights
in defiance of coastal state claims deemed excessive by the United
States, whether made by allied, neutral, or adversary states (U.S.
Department of Defense Freedom of Navigation (FON) Program, 2016).

Although some legal scholars have questioned the practice, FONOPs have
legal utility. Some [scholars assert that diplomatic protest is
sufficient, and operational assertions are legally unnecessary,
diplomatically unhelpful, and potentially even an unlawful abuse of
rights]{.underline} (Aceves, 1995). In their definitive statement,
however, Roach and Smith argue that the FON program simply hedges
effectively against the possibility that U.S. protests on paper might be
invalidated by sustained U.S. behavior on the seas. They note, "These
assertions of rights and freedoms tangibly exhibit U.S. determination
not to acquiesce in excessive claims to maritime jurisdiction by other
states" (Roach & Smith, 1994: 6). Dale Stephens has offered a similar
argument for the utility of such operations (Stephens, 2012).

[The U.S. cannot target every excessive claim impinging on navigational
rights through the Freedom of Navigation program's operational
dimension. In a strictly legal sense, the logic of a FONOP is that a
vessel is doing something that the coastal state prohibits that vessel
from doing]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} that [the flag state
believes]{.underline} [is]{.underline} within the [right]{.underline}s
of the vessel. [A vessel's actions can only protest a restriction that
applies to it. For example, government-owned and -operated vessels,
including warships, enjoy immunity from environmental regulations under
Article 236 UNCLOS]{.underline} (McDorman, 2015). They [thus cannot be
used]{.underline} to protest excessive environmental regulations [on
behalf of all vessels]{.underline}---at most they can protest that
environmental rules are applied to sovereign immune vessels.

#### FONOPs are largely useless and hurt relations

Cornell **Overfield**, **2021** ,a specialist in the relationship
between maritime law and foreign policy at CNA, "FONOP in Vain: The
Legal Logics of a U.S. Navy FONOP in the Canadian or Russian Arctic",
Arctic Yearbook,
<https://arcticyearbook.com/arctic-yearbook/2021/2021-scholarly-papers/375-fonop-in-vain-the-legal-logics-of-a-us-navy-fonop-in-the-canadian-or-russian-arctic>

Based on the analysis here, [the U.S. Navy will find precious little in
the Arctic to target in a FONOP. Because Russia's Northern Sea Route
regime applies to commercial vessels, a U.S. FONOP by a government ship
against the NSR regime would have no legal effect]{.underline}. The U.S.
Navy or Coast Guard could sail there---but it would not be a FONOP. [The
United States could target only Russia's internal waters policy in the
Russian Arctic straits]{.underline}, although this would secure rights
for both government and commercial traffic. [If the United States or
Asian states, for that matter, are concerned about Russian restrictions
on commercial navigation, they would need to rely purely on diplomatic
protests, or conceive of new ways to protest with commercial, rather
than government, vessels]{.underline}.

[Since Canada's Arctic maritime claims impose significant constraints on
both government and commercial vessels, any U.S. Arctic FONOP would be
of greatest utility against Canada]{.underline}. Canada's internal water
claim is expansive, and the United States' counter-position affords
significant rights to both government and commercial users. [Canadian
restrictions covering the EEZ, however, only partially apply to
government vessels, and only government vessels would benefit from the
FONOP. A Canadian FONOP would have significant diplomatic costs. Such an
action would rip open the dispute that Ottawa and Washington have
successfully managed since 1988]{.underline}.

Finally, journalists and legal scholars need to press policymakers and
analysts calling for an Arctic FONOP to explicitly identify what
precisely such an action would target. [FONOPs are a common policy
prescription, but they can happen only where the operation resists an
actual legal claim applying to a warship]{.underline}. In the Arctic,
this drives the United States toward a FONOP against Canadaand offers
little purchase against Russian claims.
