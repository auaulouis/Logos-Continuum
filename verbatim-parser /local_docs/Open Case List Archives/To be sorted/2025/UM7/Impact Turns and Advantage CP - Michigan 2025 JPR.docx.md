# Notes

Thank you everyone for putting together this file!! Here is each
contributors explanation of the file.

Andrew \-\-- This file is intended to be used against military affs with
an advantage related to miscalc, nuclear escalation, etc (think domain
awareness) AND an advantage related to hegemony. The file aims to solve
the first with an advantage counterplan and impact turns the second.The
advantage counterplan does three things:\
1.    It creates hotlines\-\--if escalations escalate the president can
get on the phone to try and deescalate tensions. The evidence in this
file is intended as an addendum to the hotlines counterplan found in the
starter packet domain awareness file.\
2.    It institutes a policy of virtual nuclear deterrence\-\--it
disarms the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal but maintains the capability to
quickly build it back up.\
3.    It institutes a no first use policy which aims to signal to
adversaries that the United States isn't aggressive.The impact turn
portion of the file basically boils down to hegemony bad for x reasons
(bad for climate leadership, general military hedge, LIO bad etc.)

Tomas \-- You can use this file against affs in whatever you way you
please, but the vision for this file is to impact turn a
deterrence/assurance aff while solving residual miscalc offense with the
advantage counterplans. Most of the impact turns in this file are
contextual to either U.S. deterrence or something to do with the US-led
order, that meaning heg/LIO/alliance network, which are all things that
quite a few affs have been defending so every aff should link to
something in here. The file also contains a few revisionism updates as
well as impact defense to some scenarios.The counterplans are meant to
be a supplement for the "Hotlines CP" in the Domain Awareness file, in
that it solves miscalculation scenarios that many affirmatives present.
The file includes supplements to that counterplan while also containing
2 other planks that accomplish a similar purpose through perhaps a
better mechanism, those being the NFU and VND counterplans.

Terry \-- The file contains 3 CP\'s that are centered around solving
deterrence: miscalc CP, hotlines CP, NFU CP.\
The Miscalc Counterplan is predicated on the idea of \"Virtual
Deterrence\" in order to lead global disarmarment. However, this
doesn\'t really have alot of good extension cards and probably needs
some more work but, there are some strong answers to it. The same
explanation applies to the miscalc CP. The Hotlines CP is an extension
of the counterplan that was put out in the Military Logistics file by
BFHR and aims are making it a more viable off to run in the block or the
1NC. The counterplan specficially focuses/leans in on the say yes
arguments, but I think the aff card for PDB and the revisionism deficit
are still pretty devastating. The rest of the file is based on various
net benefits to why deterrence, assurances, and heg is bad which should
be used in conjunction with the counterplans which all aim at utilizing
soft power to circumvent nuclear escalation/miscalc scenarios instead of
hard power deployment.The aff answers are a little bit very uneven. This
file was made with the intention that affs and other camp files have
already put out the aff side for these arguments and that we are only
adding to beef up the neg a little bit lot more. The best part of the
file is probably the deterrence bad scenarios and the climate heg
scenarios because they are pretty unique.

Linchang \-\-- This file contains two big pieces of offense that are
most strategic versus the domain awareness AFF but is applicable to
future miscalculation and cooperation AFFs. First, an advantage
counterplan which resolves any miscalculation scenarios that are
specifically premised on deterrence. The most strategic utility of the
counterplan is probably the NFU plank which provides a better way to
reduce the risk of miscalculation while avoiding "deterrence" links and
avoids the net benefit to strat stab.\
Second, is the impact turns on case. Can be read as a big-stick hegemony
or deterrence bad scenario but is most strategic when utilized as
offense against any combination of Russia-China-US cooperation is key
warrants on this topic. They're also applicable to specific scenarios on
AFF's later in the year (ie. assurances bad, hard power bad, etc.)

Claire \-\-- This file has a lot of good answers vs. the Domain
Awareness aff, but the arguments can definitely be applied to similar
affs that rely on intense military action to increase deterrence and
reduce tensions in the Arctic. There's two strategies vs the two
advantages that are developed here --\
The advantage counterplan (with planks about NFU agreements, hotlines...
aka the hotlines CP from the starter packet doc, and virtual nuclear
deterrence) are meant to solve advantages about decreasing the risk of
miscalc/decreasing tensions. The second part of the file contains impact
turns to aff advantages about the importance of US heg and soft power as
a means to deter rivals, so most of the arguments in that section can be
summarized as US heg bad/deterrence through US \[hard\] power bad.

Guthrie \-\-- This file contains one-two off-case positions: an
advantage CP that solves the risk of miscalculation without increasing
US HEG (through the planks of virtual nuclear deterrence, hotlines, and
no-first use policies) and then possibly a HEG link to a FEM IR K. To
respond to advantages about alliances to counter Russia/China, there are
more cards about why deterrence or US heg is bad (for various reasons
including climate leadership, LIO, etc.). Essentially, it works very
well against any AFFs that rely upon realist military solutions to deter
Russia/China and strengthen US influence. The virtual nuclear deterrence
suggests that the US disassemble all of its nuclear capabilities but
maintain the ability to construct them. The hotline refers to increased
communication between China and the USA. The NFU plank refers to the US
officially confirming the principle of \"no-first use\" ie. that the US
will never launch its nuclear weapons first. This solves miscalc and
strat stab and doesn\'t link to HEG bad.

Haley \-\-- File Explanation:This file has impact turns to most military
affs on this topic. You can choose to impact turn certain scenarios the
aff defends (e.g. Climate Leadership) or the whole thing (e.g. Heg Bad).
This means this file also has responses to a lot of aff tricks. It makes
it much harder to get out of 'no but our hegemony is good' when the
negative has a specific straight turn to their version of hegemony. For
example this file has responses to liberal international order,
deterrence, assurances, and hard power, which are all popular
advantages. This file was structured to be run against affs like domain
awareness that have a miscalculation scenario, and a competitiveness
scenario. To deal with this, theres an advantage counterplan with
multiple planks to solve de-escalation/miscalculation/and potentially
deterrence without linking to the impact turn.A couple things to be
careful about:\
Some cards in this file may be slightly contradictory. If you're reading
the advantage counterplan plank that does virtual deterrence, it's best
not to read that with deterrence bad (or kick the plank/concede
deterrence at some point). Theres multiple options for negative strategy
but if you combine too much you might end up double turning yourself.
Some cards say US Heg is declining now but clinging to it lets
revisionist actors like Russia and China fill in, but some other cards
might say that Russia and china aren't revisionist. Most parts of this
file aren't contradictory with other DAs like Russia PTX, Relations, or
even stuff like the Security K but the aff might be able to cross apply
some things. It also probably doesn't wouldn't work very well with China
Soft Power.Good luck and have fun! Happy Impact Turning!

Eva \-\-- The main strategy for this file was based around a 1nc for
domain awareness or any aff with a deterrence advantage and an 
assurance advantage since those are looking like the most popular kinds
of affs so far.  This file was also heavily based on the case neg
already out for domain awareness like the hotlines CP but the turns are
the biggest part of this file, and the most important.For the assurance
advantage we made a advantage counterplan with hotlines, NFU, and
miscalc planks. The net benefit to the CP is the turns (heg bad/
deterrence bad etc) which turns the deterrence advantage. NFU is a
really strategic plank since it disproves perm shields the link. The heg
bad turn is the most substantial part of this file because its the most
strategic even without counterplans but it also takes the longest to
extend since you need to prove multipol is better or the current LIO is
bad. Overall I think this file will be super useful even if you dont use
everything from it because each part can be applied in so many ways to
so many different affs.

Dalton \-- Something important to note is that if you have other
advantage counterplans which solve other (non-heg) scenarios you can
read them with this file and impact turn the heg stuff, but this file's
advantage counterplans are focused on beating affs like domain awareness
with a heg scenario and a miscalc scenario, so I'll be talking in the
context of that. I think the best way to utilize this file is to read an
Advantage Counterplan that solves any 'miscalc' impact (i.e. NFU,
Hotlines, etc.) whilst impact turning any and all 'deterrence',
'assurance', 'LIO Good', etc. type of scenarios, since this prevents
them from getting any offense from the part of the case that doesn't
rely on the U.S. being great and Russia and China being the most evil
countries ever, as the advantage counterplan doesn't take up too much
time and allows you to moot around half or more of the 1AC and focus the
debate on heg good/bad, which is a really good position for the negative
to be in considering how massive the block is and how well prepared the
negative probably is for these debates compared to the aff.I think the
aff's best bet is probably to straight up kick their non-heg scenarios
and focus on heg good (like transition wars, Russia and china evil,
etc.) or focus on the non-heg scenario and spend a lot more time on the
counterplan, since if you try to do both you will do neither. I think
both routes are good, but you probably want to do the former if your
miscalc scenario is fast, since it'll probably kill everyone before heg
kills us. However, if their scenario is more along the lines of
something like "Plan causes Taiwan War" you should probably go more for
arguments like 'US heg key to deterrence' and 'china/russia evil'.\
"I  car seat headrest" -- isaac kim (Thomas please keep this in this is
ESSENTIAL for the explanation)

Devi \-\-- The file consists of many key applicable elements for both
affirmative and negative teams to apply to any argument. Some are
generic and some are specific. It starts with generic impact scenarios
and why they are good or bad (Ex. heg good, prolif good, ect) so you can
turn the AFF impact no matter their case. There are so many great cards
that you can use to create DA's, CPs, and kritik specific links.\
There are also three counterplans. First, the Hotlines CP which has been
updated from the one in Domain Awareness AFF and has better specific
links. Neg answers have also been added talking about alt reasons why
hotlines fail. Next is the Miscalculation CP because this is going to be
a common aff impact. This specific CP is still in the works but it\'s
started for you and you can add generics or cut your own cards. Finally
there is the NFU CP (no first use) which says that the US formally says
that they won\'t launch nukes first which convinces other countries
(russia, china, ect) and you can run strat stab DA and no miscalc turn
for potentially OFF case positions.\
You can also change the tags of some cards to make them case specific.
For example, Domain Awareness -\> tech fails card -\> domain awareness
tech (name ones in the card) fails to link better to the AFF which is
good for both sides.\
Finally there are AFF answers, although not as substantial as the NEG
cards but there are other generics you can find in other files put out
in the UM Camp Files.\
Overall this is a great file to use for any impact scenario, to turn
case, DA, CP, ect. and you can use these on the case page for extra
offense and defense. All the cards are applicable anywhere in the
debate.

#### The United States Federal Government should institute a no-first use policy. 

#### It [solves]{.underline}. NFU sends a credible signal which spurs [risk mitigation]{.underline} and [follow-on]{.underline} better in [all domains]{.underline}.

In important respects, however, the situation is different today.
[[There is a]{.underline} [greater **need to find ways to
signal**]{.underline}]{.mark} [mutual **[nuclear restraint]{.mark}** and
to clarify each other's respective strategic intentions.]{.underline} US
allies in Asia, no less than US officials past and present, moreover,
can see that Chinese nuclear modernization is intended to [sustain US
vulnerability.]{.underline} Refusing to formally acknowledge such
vulnerability will not change that reality. Political criticism can
still be expected. However, [it [could]{.mark} well [be muted if by
lessening Chinese concerns about US intentions]{.mark}, that statement
pays of **[with lessened pressures for Chinese nuclear
modernization]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [restraint
in]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese **[[behavior in other
domains]{.underline}]{.mark}** impacting (including counter-space),
[[and overall greater]{.underline}
**[transparency]{.underline}**]{.mark} [concerning China's nuclear
intentions, plans, and programs]{.underline}. Both countries would
benefit. Thus, a new look at such a joint statement is warranted.
[[A]{.mark} related joint [statement would be a]{.mark} "**Mutual
[No-First-Strategic-Attacks]{.mark}**["
pledge]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}16 This pledge would encompass, but
[extend beyond a mutual commitment to no-first-use]{.underline} of
nuclear weapons. Regardless of the means, [[it would]{.underline}
[include first attacks **against nuclear
deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark} [delivery systems, space- or
ground-based **[NC3]{.mark}**, **[early-warning]{.mark}** architecture,
national command authorities, [and **homeland
defenses**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A no-first-strategic-attacks pledge
could be a stand-alone statement or be folded into the broader statement
on stabilizing the mutual deterrence relationship. At one level, a joint
no-first-strategic attacks [[pledge]{.mark} again [would be an]{.mark}
[important **signal** of strategic intent]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
As such, [[it could reduce pressures]{.underline}]{.mark} for
competitive armament. Negotiation or exchanges on such a statement,
e.g., how to define a strategic attack, also would provide insights into
each country's thinking as well as an opportunity to clarify red lines
and [[address **misperceptions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} If realized, a
no-first-strategic attacks commitment also could be expected to
influence elements of each country's military programs and [force
posture of concern to the other country]{.underline}, from sizing of US
homeland missile defenses and longer range **[[hypersonic]{.mark}
missile capabilitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Chinese [counter-space
capabilities to a shift to a launch-on-warning nuclear
posture]{.underline}. Backed by restraint in practice, [it would [help
**mitigate the risk of conflict** escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}
[toward the nuclear threshold]{.underline}. Its violation in the midst
of conflict would come at significant risk, not least, possible counter
escalation based on an expectation of a more complete breakdown of
mutual restraint. Chinese [[officials have]{.mark} long [emphasized
China's no-first-use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons]{.underline} policy
[[and **called on other nuc**]{.mark}**lear-armed [states to]{.mark}
[adopt]{.mark} comparable [policies.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Chinese
participants in the semi-official Track 1.5 dialogue also have [stressed
that [a **US commitment**]{.mark} to no-first-use of nuclear weapons
[would be]{.mark} **highly [reassuring to China]{.mark}**]{.underline}
as an indication of US strategic intentions.17 A US commitment to
no-first-strategic attacks also would bring [more practical benefits for
sustaining China's nuclear deter rent]{.underline}, given its expected
i[mpacts on US programs]{.underline} and posture. Nonetheless, a [more
comprehensive no-first-strategic-attacks commitment would require China
to forgo options in which it has **invested significantly**]{.underline}
as part of its anti-access, anti-intervention posture (e.g., strikes
against dual-purpose US satellites).

As Kingston Reif and Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association have
argued[, "[a clear U.S. no first-use policy would reduce the risk of
Russian or Chinese nuclear miscalc]{.mark}ulation during a crisis by
alleviating concerns about a devastating U.S. nuclear
first-strike."]{.underline}24 This would mean that the United States
would rely on nuclear weapons only to deter nuclear attacks. [[Adopting
this approach would]{.mark} involve more than "cheap talk," for it would
[require meaningful doctrinal]{.mark} and operational
[changes]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 Specifically, it would allow the United
States to adopt a less threatening nuclear posture. It would eliminate
first-strike postures, preemptive capabilities, and other types of
destabilizing warfighting strategies. It would emphasize restraint in
targeting, launch-on-warning, alert levels of deployed systems,
procurement, and modernization plans. In other words[, [it
would]{.underline}]{.mark} [help shape the physical qualities of nuclear
forces in a way that renders them unsuitable for missions other than
deterrence of nuclear attacks.]{.underline}26 Implementing these steps
would [[significantly reduce the risk of accidental, unauthorized,
mistaken, or preemptive use]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The removal of
threats of a nuclear first strike would [also strengthen
strategic]{.mark} and crisis [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}.27 Of
perhaps equal importance[, [adopting an NFU policy would]{.mark} help
[address humanitarian concerns]{.mark} and reduce the salience of
nuclear weapons.]{.underline}28 Likewise, it would "be more consistent
with the long-term goal of global nuclear disarmament [and would [better
contribute to]{.underline}]{.mark} [US [nuclear nonproliferation
objectives]{.mark}."29 [A multilateral NFU pledge would have **even
more** benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would [[move Russia and
Pakistan away from their high-risk doctrines and reduce]{.mark} a source
of [Russia-NATO tensions]{.mark}. A common [NFU policy would help
anchor]{.mark} the [existing NFU policies of China and India]{.mark} and
implicitly acknowledge their leadership in this area]{.underline}, a
virtue when middlepower states are feeling disenfranchised from the
global nuclear order. Some analysts have questioned whether[, [in an
asymmetric conflict]{.mark}, an [American NFU policy would]{.mark}
actually [help reduce the risk of nuclear escalation]{.mark} by an
adversary]{.underline}. The United States is so conventionally dominant,
they argue that, in a crisis, a country like North Korea might employ
nuclear weapons preemptively because the United States could take out
North Korean targets even with just conventional weapons.30 It is true
that an NFU policy might make no difference in such a situation. Still,
it might nevertheless remove at least one source of crisis instability.
Most importantly, however, in an era of "multi-front" deterrence, North
Korea is not the only adversary [and]{.mark} a [U.S. NFU policy would
remain valuable [in less asymmetric conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
second concern is that a real NFU strategy would require a greater
commitment to a countervalue targeting strategy --- targeting civilians
rather than nuclear silos --- and thus run up against moral and legal
rules prohibiting the direct targeting of civilians.31 This is a
legitimate point. However, current U.S. counterforce targeting policy
will likely result in massive civilian casualties as "collateral
damage," making the risk to civilians of an NFU strategy little
different.3 [[**The United States ought to unilaterally adopt an NFU
policy**, and ask other nuclear-armed states to do the same. This would
constitute the formal adoption of what is already]{.mark} essentially
[de facto U.S. policy]{.mark}]{.underline}.33 A [[U.S. NFU policy would
create political space for Russia to follow suit]{.mark}: For Russia to
consider NFU, its concerns about U.S. ballistic missile defenses,
imbalances in conventional forces, and issues of NATO enlargement would
need to be addressed. The United States would also need to tackle the
issue of extended deterrence with its allies and move toward
conventional extended deterrence]{.underline}.34 India and Pakistan
would need a modus vivendi on Kashmir, while the United States and North
Korea would need to sign a non-aggression pact. In fact, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} actually [negotiate
a]{.mark} mutual NFU [agreement with North Korea]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The United States is extremely unlikely to use nuclear weapons first on
North Korea, therefore an agreement that provided a basis for [imposing
some restraint on the North Korean arsenal would be [in America's
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 Doctrinal and operational changes would
need to follow such a declaration. China's restrained nuclear arsenal
provides the best example of an NFU pledge implemented in practice.
Unlike the United States and Russia, [[China keeps its warheads and
missiles separated]{.mark}. It has not developed precision-strike
nuclear war-fighting capabilities, such as tactical nuclear weapons,
[and it does not keep its forces on "launch-on-warning"
alert]{.mark}.]{.underline} China has also invested heavily in
conventional military modernization so that it would not have to
consider nuclear escalation in a conventional war.36 [[India, too, keeps
its warheads and missiles separate in support of its NFU
pledge]{.underline}]{.mark}, though some analysts argue that India's NFU
policy does not run especially deep and that it "is neither a stable nor
a reliable predictor of how the Indian military and political leadership
might actually use nuclear weapons."37 Nevertheless, both countries'
operational postures reflect (to some degree) their NFU policies.38
[[The United States and the other nuclear powers should move in this
direction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### CP solves miscalculation and strategic stability

**Kimball, '18** (Daryl G. Kimball is the Executive Director of the Arms
Control Association, October 2018, \"The Case for a U.S. No-First-Use
Policy\", The Arms Control Association,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-10/focus/case-us-no-first-use-policy> -
[GL]{.mark}

Stanley Kubrick's classic 1964 film "Dr. Strangelove" delivers an eerily
accurate depiction of the absurd logic and catastrophic risks of U.S.
and Russian Cold War nuclear deterrence strategy, but for one key
detail: President Merkin Muffley was wrong when he said, "It is the
avowed policy of our country never to strike first with nuclear
weapons." But it should be. Fortunately, the nuclear "doomsday machine"
has not yet been unleashed. [Arms control agreements have led to
significant, verifiable reductions in the U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals, the two countries have ceased nuclear testing, and they have
tightened checks on nuclear command and control. But [the potential for
a catastrophic nuclear war remains]{.mark}. [The core elements of Cold
War-era U.S. nuclear strategy are]{.mark} largely [the same]{.mark},
[including the option to use nuclear weapons first and the]{.mark}
maintenance of prompt-launch [policies that]{.mark} still [give the
president unchecked authority to order]{.mark} the use of [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} Today, the [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and Russia deploy]{.mark} massive strategic nuclear
[arsenals consisting of up to 1,550 warheads]{.mark} on each
side]{.underline}, as allowed under the 2010 New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty. These numbers greatly exceed what it would take to
decimate the other side and are far larger than required to deter a
nuclear attack. Worse still, [each side maintains the capability to fire
a significant portion of its land- and sea-based missiles promptly and
retains plans to launch these forces, particularly land-based missiles,
under attack to guard against a "disarming" first strike. U.S. and
Russian leaders also still reserve the option to use nuclear weapons
first.]{.underline} As a result, President Donald [[Trump]{.mark}, whom
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reportedly [described as having the
intellect of a "fifth-]{.mark} or sixth-[grader]{.mark}," [has the
authority to order the launch]{.mark} of some [800 nuclear warheads
within about 15 minutes]{.mark}, with hundreds more weapons remaining in
reserve. [No other]{.mark} military or civilian [official must approve
the order. Congress]{.mark} currently [has no say]{.mark} in the
matter.]{.underline} Continuing to vest such destructive power in the
hands of one person is undemocratic, irresponsible, unnecessary and
increasingly untenable. [Cavalier and [reckless statements from
Trump]{.mark} about nuclear weapons use [only underscore the folly of
vesting]{.mark} such [unchecked authority in one
person]{.mark}]{.underline}. Making matters worse, the Trump
administration's Nuclear Posture Review expands the range of
contingencies and options for potential nuclear use and proposes the
development of "more-usable" low-yield nuclear weapons in order to give
the president the flexibility to respond quickly in a crisis, including
by using nuclear weapons first in response to a non-nuclear attack. [The
reality is that [a launch-under-attack policy is unnecessary because
U.S. nuclear force]{.mark}s and command-and-control systems [could
withstand even a massive attack]{.mark}. Given the size, accuracy, and
diversity of U.S. forces, [the remaining nuclear force would be more
than sufficient]{.mark} to deliver a devastating blow to any nuclear
aggressor]{.underline}. In addition[, [keeping]{.underline}]{.mark}
[strategic [forces on launch-under-attack mode **increases the risk of
miscalculation and misjudgment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Throughout
the history of the nuclear age, there have been several incidents in
which false signals of an attack have prompted U.S. and Russian
officials to consider, in the dead of the night and under the pressure
of time, launching nuclear weapons in retaliation. No U.S. leader should
be put in a situation that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons
based on false information. [Retaining the option [to use nuclear
weapons first is fraught with]{.mark} unnecessary
[peril]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the overwhelming conventional
military edge of the United States and its allies, there is no plausible
circumstance that could justify legally, morally, or militarily the use
of nuclear weapons to deal with a non-nuclear threat. [Even in the event
of a conventional military conflict with Russia, China, or North Korea[,
the first use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [would be counterproductive
because it]{.mark} likely [would trigger]{.mark} an uncontrollable,
potentially [suicidal all-out nuclear exchange]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Some in Washington and Brussels believe Moscow might use or threaten to
use nuclear weapons first to try to deter NATO from pressing its
conventional military advantage in a conflict. Clearly, a nuclear war
cannot be won and should not be initiated by either side. [The threat of
[first use]{.mark}, however, cannot overcome perceived or real
conventional force imbalances and are [not an effective substitute
for]{.mark} prudently [maintaining U.S. and NATO conventional forces in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the major nuclear powers race to develop
new nuclear capabilities and advanced conventional-strike weapons and
consider using cybercapabilities to pre-empt nuclear attacks by
adversaries, [[the risk that one leader may be tempted]{.mark} to use
nuclear weapons first [during a crisis likely will grow]{.mark}**. [A
shift to a no-first-use posture]{.mark}, on the other hand, [would
increase strategic stability]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Although the Trump
administration is not going to rethink nuclear old-think, leaders in
Congress and the next administration must re-examine and revise outdated
nuclear launch policies in ways that reduce the nuclear danger.
[[Shifting to a formal policy stating that the United States will not be
the first to use nuclear weapons]{.mark} and that the sole purpose of
nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack [would be a
significant]{.mark} and smart step in the right direction.]{.underline}

### 2NC/1NR\-\--Solvency, China

#### NFU solves tensions with China 

Hans **Binnendijk**, 2-7-20**23** \"Towards Nuclear Stewardship with
China\", Taylor & Francis,
<https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2023.2172846//evchkra>

With the rising risk of complex crises and military escalation in the
Pacific region, [[the United States]{.mark} [should invite China
into]{.mark} a process of nuclear restraint and confidence-building,
which we call '**[nuclear stewardship']{.mark}**. This process could
[start]{.mark} with a [joint bilateral declaration that neither]{.mark}
superpower [would]{.mark} [use nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s first against
the other or its]{.mark} formal [allies]{.mark}. This would acknowledge
that neither side could gain by striking first with a nuclear device.
[This]{.mark} declaration [could]{.mark} be the [lead]{.mark}ing edge of
a [broader]{.mark} set of [discussions on strategic stability
and]{.mark} eventual implementation of confidence-building measures
designed to enhance mutual understanding and [trust]{.mark} in the
US--Chinese nuclear relationship.]{.underline}

While some might argue that a no-first-use (NFU) pledge is flawed
because it could be ignored in a crisis[, it would nonetheless [help
start a process]{.mark} aimed [at **reducing mutual suspicion**]{.mark}
about the nuclear motives of the other party. And such a pledge could be
reinforced in peacetime by monitoring the military exercises of the
other party and in a crisis by America's overwhelming nuclear strength.
[The **benefits** ]{.mark}**far [outweigh the
risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Such an initiative would [introduce a [coop]{.mark}erative
[pursuit]{.mark} in an otherwise fraught relationship, while also
[set]{.mark}ting an [example for other nuclearweapons
states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Conventional deterrence in the region can
be sustained with strong US and allied defence efforts, and Asian allies
can be further reassured that the US will defend them conventionally and

[The Benefits of No First Use]{.underline}

For the United States and its allies, [[NFU has several]{.mark} military
and political [benefits]{.mark}. First, [it would **enhance crisis
stability**]{.mark}. A [credible]{.mark} NFU [policy]{.mark} would help
[decrease]{.mark} an opponent\'s trepidations about a U.S. first strike,
thereby reducing the [possibility that nuclear weapons are used
accidentally]{.mark}, inadvertently, or deliberately in a severe
crisis.]{.underline}

Second, NFU would give the United States a consistent and inherently
credible nuclear policy. Although some states might question U.S.
political resolve to use nuclear weapons first, [[adversaries cannot
dismiss the possibility of a]{.mark} nuclear
[response]{.mark}]{.underline} after U.S. interests have been attacked
with nuclear weapons. The threat to use nuclear weapons in response to a
nuclear attack is highly credible, and it is a threat that U.S.
political leaders should want to execute if deterrence fails.

Third, NFU could help assuage some of the recent criticisms of U.S.
missile defense and nuclear stockpile maintenance initiatives. [A
[credible]{.mark} NFU [policy]{.mark} could help [**alleviate concerns**
that missile defenses might be used to complement offensive
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as providing a \"safety net\" for
any remaining weapons launched in retaliation after a U.S. first strike
against a state\'s nuclear capabilities. [An NFU [policy]{.mark} might
also [score]{.mark} political [points with domestic]{.mark} opposition
to [efforts]{.mark} by the United States [to update]{.mark} its aging
nuclear stockpile. NFU could help ease domestic and international
concerns that efforts to update [and enhance]{.mark} the safety and
[security]{.mark} features [of the]{.mark} U.S. nuclear [arsenal]{.mark}
might [inadvertently **signal** that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[views]{.mark} [nuclear weapons as]{.mark} militarily
[useful.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Finally, [[NFU]{.mark} would provide the United States with important
political benefits in its efforts to [lead]{.mark} the [nonproliferation
regime]{.mark} and encourage greater international support for
nonproliferation initiatives.]{.underline} Many nonnuclear member states
of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) often base their lack of support
for U.S.-led multilateral nonproliferation initiatives on the grounds
that the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[has **not done enough** to fulfill its obligation to Article
6]{.underline}]{.mark} of the NPT, which commits the declared nuclear
states to disarmament. Thus, [[NFU]{.underline}]{.mark}, by
[[symboliz]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[an important
step]{.underline}]{.mark} toward realizing Article 6, would help remove
a significant roadblock to greater support for and participation in the
NPT regime among nonnuclear NPT member states.

[Reality: Like any political commitment, [the credibility of an NFU
policy will rely on the actions the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[takes to back it up]{.mark}. In the long term, the United States can
take steps to shift to a "deterrence-only" nuclear force
posture.]{.underline} For example, de-alerting the land-based leg of the
triad would work in conjunction with an NFU policy to improve stability
in a crisis. Eventually, Washington could reevaluate the necessity of
the ICBM force altogether. [In the near-term, [even if allies and
adversaries are skeptical of a U.S. NFU policy at first, the commitment
will create an incentive and opportunity for an adversary to communicate
directly with the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to confirm its
intentions and reduce the risk of miscalculation]{.mark} in a
crisis.]{.underline}

**Why not no limits instead of no first use? **The case for no first use
rests on two main pillars: keeping the option of first use is
dangerous*,* and it is unnecessary. One could also conceivably invoke a
further argument that any first use would be potentially illegal under
international humanitarian law. But the relevant considerations
here---necessity, proportionality, and so on---are just as applicable to
retaliatory use as they are to first use, and as such don't advance the
present argument.

*A no-limits option is dangerous.* Retaining a first-use option is
dangerous, both for wider global peace and security and often for
nuclear-armed states' own interests, in five main ways:

A nuclear-armed state that keeps a first-strike option runs the risk of
an adversary misreading its intentions and, fearing decapitation,
launching a preemptive strike of its own, precipitating an otherwise
wholly avoidable nuclear war.

A nuclear-armed state that fears a surprise first-use attack from
another which has kept open that option is more likely to put its own
forces on extreme launch alert, thereby increasing the risk of human or
system error or miscalculation causing a launch which precipitates the
very catastrophe it is trying to avert.

[[Refusing to adopt]{.mark} no first use [encourages vertical]{.mark}
nuclear [proliferation]{.mark}, which incentivises potential
[adversaries]{.mark} to [upgrade their]{.mark} own nuclear [forces to
deny]{.mark} their [opponents]{.mark} a [first-use advantage or gain one
themselves]{.mark}. That way fosters nuclear arms races, with all the
multiplication of risk these necessarily involve.]{.underline}

[Refusing to adopt no first use inherently [encourages
horizontal]{.mark} nuclear [proliferation]{.mark}---[adding]{.mark} new
nuclear-armed [states to]{.mark} the [mix]{.mark}---with all the risks
of both deliberate and accidental nuclear exchange that come with that.
When a state with any kind of conventional capability insists that it
needs nuclear weapons to deter or defeat non-nuclear attacks, it
necessarily concedes that right to any other country fearing, or
claiming to fear, such attack.]{.underline}

Major-power refusal to embrace no first use can make it harder to wind
back breakouts by others actually or apparently under way. Insisting
that "all options are on the table," as the Bush administration did with
Tehran, played into the hands of Iran's domestic hardliners and made
negotiated nuclear risk reduction much more difficult to achieve.
Arguably, a clear US no-first-use policy would also help alleviate at
least some of the anxieties currently inhibiting progress on North
Korean denuclearization.

[In its most straightforward form, \'virtual nuclear capabilities\'
([VNC]{.mark}) are [possessed]{.mark} [by a state which has]{.mark}, or
could have [access to]{.mark} sufficient quantities of [weapons-usable
fissile material]{.mark} and/or the ability to produce it, and which
also possesses the requisite technical equipment, materials and [skills
to produce]{.mark} a nuclear [device]{.mark}.]{.underline} \'Virtual
nuclear deterrence\' (VND) could be the assumed benefit a state might
wish to derive from its VNC, especially if that state can use its
fissile material, equipment and skills to produce a nuclear device in a
period of only weeks or months. This definition of VND can be modified
to suit several different types of VND posture. The term
\'weapons-usable\' is employed here because of the proven ability of
nuclear powers to build nuclear weapons lIsing reactor-grade, rather
than weapons-grade fissile material. The United States is known to have
conducted at least two nuclear tests using reactor-grade material and
Sweden also investigated this technology. Other nuclear powers, notably
India, may also have conducted research into this option, which would
become much more significant after any future ban on the manufacture of
weaponsgrade fissile material takes effect. This report assumes that
after a nuclear disarmament treaty the former nuclear powers might still
have faith in their understanding of the concept of \'deterrence\' in
the context of their \'virtual nuclear arsenals\'. They would do so
because there is no reason to suppose that such a treaty would
necessarily, in their eyes, invalidate previous deterrence theories.
Opponents of nuclear weapons have often felt uncomfortable with-if not
contemptuous of-nuclear deterrence theory. But for those who believe
that nuclear weapons do deter, the core of nuclear deterrence theory was
always the impossibility of disproving, at least as long as nuclear
weapons were never used, that possession of nuclear weapons would deter
a hostile power. The same arguments about deterrence theory would all
continue to be aired and would no doubt still be the source of intense
debate after any future nuclear disarmament treaty was implemented. The
debate would arguably even strengthen deterrence. For the record,
nuclear deterrence at the end of the Cold War was assumed to mean the
following strategy, as outlined by the NATO heads of state and
government in their London Declaration of 6 July 1990:1 These \[nuclear
weapons\] will continue to fulfil an essential role in the overall
strategy of the Alliance to prevent war by ensuring that there are 110
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation might be discounted. By 1998,
in the British Strategic Defence Review. one justification of nuclear
deterrence theory had been modified:2 Deterrence is about preventing war
rather than fighting it \... The Government wishes to see a safer world
in which there is no place for nuclear weapons \.... while large nuclear
arsenals and risks of proliferation remain, our n11nlmum deterrent
remains a necessary element of our security. Clearly the current nuclear
weapon states (NWS) and de bcrn nuclear weapon states (DfNWS) would
satisfy the basic VNC requirements of possessing fissile material and
the relevant technologies even after they had dismantled their nuclear
arsenals under the provisions of a nuclear disarmament treaty. This
would be rhe case even if all their weapons-grade fissile material had
been safeguarded. A number of other countries would also be in the same
category, even though the great majority are currently parties to the
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and most are nor judged to be
\'nations of concern\'. A country which has possessed nuclear weapons
take a long time for various South Africans\' tacit knowledge ahout
nuclear weapons assembly to dissipate. Without documentation and the
ordered dissemination of tacit knowledge, it could be said that such
knowledge will only disappear when the scientists involved actually pass
away- as long as they do not commit the essentials of their tacit
knowledge and skills to others, or leave it on paper. If weapon design
documentation is retained-and as Mazzarr has observed there is no reason
\[0 suppose it has not been kept somewhere in Sweden for example-a
country could be said to retain its VNC. The tacit knowledge associated
with nuclear weapons will continue to exist in the minds of many
personnel formerly involved in the various nuclear weapon programs
following any nuclear disarmament treaty. Even without the tacit
knowledge of the cognoscenti, a wealth of material about nuclear weapons
will still be available in open print and in the electronic media.
SOl11e of that information includes surprising levels of detail on
nuclear weapon design, providing any country with a basic
\'do-it-yourself kit\' on the essential technical requirements of a
basic VND posture. Various internet sites demonstrate that the
essentials about nuclear weaponry, including detailed information on and
diagrams of weapons ,1 nd design principles, are freely available to
anyone with the dme and inclination to 10ok.S .lust as there is also the
ever-present threat of a sub-national group developing a simple and,
using the hackneyed term, \'crude\' nuclear weapon using less
challenging technologies, countries could conceivably choose to exercise
a \'virtual\' deterrence in the same way. One authority, quoting an
admittedly controversial analysis, has said that all it might take to
build a nuclear device is one year\'s effort or the efforts of two major
industrial companies.6 The Office of Technology Assessment (OTAI of the
US Congress concluded in 1977 that:7 A small group of people, none of
whom have ever had access to the classified literature, could possibly
design and build a crude nuclear· explosive device. They would not
necessarily require a great deal of technological equipment Of have to
undertake any experiments. Only modest machine-shop facilities that
could be contracted for without arousing suspicion would be required.
The financial resources for the acquisition of necessary equipment on
open markets need not exceed a fraction of a million dollars. The group
would have to include, at the minimum, a person capablc of researching
and understanding the literature In several fields and a jack-of·all
trades technician \... There is a clear possibility that a clever and
competent group could design and construct a device which would produce
a significant yield (i.e. a yield much greater than the yield of an
equal mass of high explosive). Because of the documentation and tacit
knowledge-never mind the fissile materialwhich might still be available
in a future \'nuclear weapon-free world\', it is very important to avoid
hyperbole in considering what \'free of nuclear weapons\' might actually
mean after a nuclear disarmament treaty is implemented. Even if worries
over the residual ambitions of the NWS and DFNWS are discounted
following conclusion of such a treaty (and these worries would he
considerable) any state with VNC (civil nuclear power-plants and a
reasonable industrial infrastructure and scientific skills base) will
still be theoretically able ro exercise a form of VND if it wishes-even
if it has never had any military nuclear ambitions in the past. In 1988
some 40 states were expected to be capable of manufacturing a nuclear
device by 2000.8 Of the states on that list, perhaps five or six could
still theoretically build a nuclear weapon in a matter of months,
depending on the concentration of national effort. Those states are
Belgium, Germany, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands. North Korea could be
added if, as suspected, it has retained sufficient weapons-usable
plutonium reprocessed from fuel rods clandestinely removed from the
Yongbyon reactor before meaningful IAEA controls were introduced.\') All
these countries are industrialised states with the requisite facilities
ro build nuclear weapons, even if all are NPT parties; North Korea has
also pledged not to build nuclear weapons under its arrangements with
the US. The original tnt list on which this estimate is based also
included India, Israel, Pakistan and South Africa. 10 South Africa has
disposed of its nuclear arsenal, while India and Pakistan have tested
devices and possess small arsenals. Israel is known to possess a
somewhat larger arsenal. If these states or the NWS ever disarm they
will still retain a theoretical capability, which has been well defined
by Jonathan Schell in The AiJOliti011 as \'weaponless aeterrence\'.l1
However, a so-called \'minimal\' or \'low salieqt\' deterrent under
which a small number of weapons might be retained by a NNWS or DFNWS, in
eirher assembled or disassembled form, would still not constitute a truc
\'virtual\' arsenal and should not be regarded as such. Such a
capability is fairly routinely-and mistakenly-assumed in some of the
literature to have the same meaning as the explicit VND posture
described in this report. Such a capability, which would certainly exist
in the period before \'zero\', is covered in more detail in the second
report in this VERTIC study. Some ideas on how minimal or low salient
deterrents might constitute a form of VND or virtual arsenal are very
curious, when considered in the context of nuclear disarmament. For
instance, one \'post-nuclear ethic\' which has been suggested is the
retention of 100-200 \'actual\' nuclear weapons, with a much larger
\'virtual\' arsenal of disassembled or deactivated weapons held in
teserve.12 Retaining 100-200 weapons plus a larger number of
disassembled weapons as a so-called minimal nuclear force would mean
retaining an arsenal which is probably close in size to those now
deployed by the United Kingdom or Israel-hardly models of virtual
nuclear deterrence. [[Retaining]{.mark}, say, anything between 10 and 80
weapons, or the [fissile material needed to produce]{.mark} them, might
e[quate to the present size of the Indian and Pakistani]{.mark} actual
or \'virtual\' [nuclear arsenals]{.mark}, and would be larger than the
past South African arsenal.]{.underline} In this context it is also
irrelevant whether or not a DFNWS is a \'screw turn\' or two away from
an assembled device. The DFNWS are nuclear powers in every substantive
sense of the term. Their remaining nuclear ambiguities (if there are
any) may even undermine their own notions of what constitutes
deterrence, especially if their new advances in nuclear weapons-related
technology (missiles, reactors and the like) only worsen tensions over
their de facto military nuclear capabilities. In a more extreme version
of the above, far removed from VND and yet described as providing the
building blocks of a so-called \'minimum deterrence\' or \'virtual
abolition\' environment, a \'stable\' US virtual nuclear arsenal in the
year 2040 comprising hundreds of warheads could effectively be a major
capability13. In the eyes of any nuclear power other than the US or
Russia, such retained weapons and capabilities would be a more than
adequate nuclear capability today. Such ideas are far removed from how a
truly virtual capability might better protect the interests of a country
which has signed a nuclear disarmament treaty. The worries of the
non-NWS parties to the NPT that VND might allow parties to a nuclear
disarmament treaty to keep their military nuclear capabilities for ever,
preserving the gap between the nuclear \'haves\' and the nuclear \'have
nots\', will have to be addressed within the architecture of the
disarmament treaty. This would mean that the treaty would have to be
unambiguous in reinforcing any existing ban on the production of
weapons-usable fissile material and would have to contain a process for
the gradual dismantlement of the nuclear weapon infrastructures of the
NWS and DFNWS. This period, perhaps ten years, is assumed to be the
operating period of the VND postures outlined in this report. The
unavoidable lesson of the foregoing is that all the NWS and DFNWS would
still be able to count on what they might perceive to be the
\'benefits\' of some form of VND posture following implementation of a
nuclear disarmament treaty if they wished-as might many other countries.
The next question is: to what ends might virtual capabilities and a VND
posture be put?

[[Virtual]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence]{.mark} could be the [best interim
form of security]{.mark} that parties [to a global]{.mark} nuclear
[disarmament treaty]{.mark} might have against \'hreakout\', thar is,
when another party breaches the treaty and reassembles nuclear devices.
The [assumption that VND]{.mark} could [become]{.mark} part of the
[disarmament \'end game\']{.mark} for the NWS and DFNWS could critically
[influence]{.mark} the nuclear powers\' [willingness to sign]{.mark}
such a nuclear [disarmament treaty.]{.mark}]{.underline} The varying
degrees of scepticism about disarmament which the NWS displayed since
they became nuclear powers demonstrate that the task of ever persuading
them to accept disarmament will be an immense political challenge. If
there is ever to be the faintest hope of meeting this objective it will
be necessary to show them that It could he in their security interests
to sign such a treaty. [The merits of [VND]{.mark} could be used to
[sweeten]{.mark} what the nuclear [powers]{.mark} Illay [regard as the
bitter and hazardous pill of disarmament]{.mark}.]{.underline} It could
help convince them that the signature of a treaty is not quite the leap
into the unknown they might fear, because there will be the temporary
security afforded by virtual nuclear deterrence. But VND should not he
regarded as an end in itself, only as a stage on the road to a world
unambiguously free of nuclear weapons. As proposed, any VND posture
would at most be a temporary security measure lasting up to ten years.
The former NWS and DFNWS would adopt VND precisely because it could be
presented as a temporary form of security against \'breakout\' from 3.
nuclear disarmament treaty by another former nuclear power. Just as it
will be very difficult to ever persuade the NWS to accept nuclear
disarmamene, there will be no chance of it ever being accepted if the
DFNWS do not sign up to it. Therefore a policy reliant on VND might
become the internationally recognised temporary security policy of the
DFNWS after such a treaty. The past stance of all of the DFNWS was that
they never admitted to possessing nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan
have now openly tested, although Israel still adopts a deliberately
ambiguous stance, despite its known capabilities. All these countries
can produce nuclear devices: India tested one in 1974 and five more in
1998; an astonishing wealth of detail about the Israeli programme was
revealed by formet Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu in 1986,
while Israel may have clandestinely tested in the 1960s and 1979;
Pakistan tested six devices in\] 998, following a long-standing research
programme. But in the context of VND\'s role in getting to \'zero\', it
might nevertheless be very useful for the NWS to simply accept the
preferred stance of each of the DFNWS- whatever each may be- during the
negotiations on a nuclear disarmament treaty. Such an apparently relaxed
attitude on the part of the NWS would shift the argument over the
DFNWS\' actual nuclear capabilities to consideration of what their
desired future status should he following a nuclear disarmament treaty.
At that time, they too could adopt a VND posture. The temporary security
that this would afford them could become a major inducement to securing
their agreement to actual nuclear disarmament. This would essentially
mean that India, Israel and Pakistan would adopt the South African model
as part of the nuclear disarmamem \'end game\', unilaterally dismantling
weapons in thdf possession and placing the fissile rnaterial in storage
prior to its disposal. Given the extreme scepticism of the nuclear
powers about disarmament and the certainty that sustained political
pressure will have to be maintained to achieve that end, VND could well
provide what these powers may feel is a welcome alternative to the
politically increasingly embarrassing choice of doing nothing. (Ill this
context, NWS reactions to the Indian and Pakistani tests in 1998 provide
an interesting indicator of how easily minds can be concemrated on the
previously unacceptable idea of a level negotiating playing field with
the DFNWS). VND could therefore help tip the balance towards an
acceptance of complete nuclear disarmament. It could provide roday\'s
nuclear we.tpOll decision-makers with an alternative to the view that
nuclear disarmament is impossible. since it could give them confidence
that a reliable form of security could he maintained during the final
\'end game\' phase of the nuclear disarmament process following
implementation of a disarmament treaty. If the potential benefits of VND
are to be appreciated, the arguments against both it and other virtual
arsenal concepts must be faced. One persistent critic, Kenneth Waltz,
has written that: 14 Nuclear weapons have always formed part of the
scenery of international politics, which is the appropriate place for
weapons suited for deterring rather than for fighting. One may hope, and
virtual wea/Jcmceys do in {act hope, (emphasis added) that nuclear
weapons will continue to cast their shadow over international affairs,
thus providing a considerable assurance of peace among states enjoying
their protection. The notion that virtual weaponeers hope that nuclear
weapons will \'continue to cast their shadow over international
affairs\' does not take inro account the concept of tacit VND, or
something like it, as a stage on the road to complete nuclear
disarmament, as outlined in this report. In the same commentary Waltz
asserts that: IS For two closely connected reasons a system of virtual
arsenals is untenable. First, deterrence without second-strike forces
will not work. Second, a system of virtual arsenals would be unstable.
[The [idea that]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence]{.mark} is [dependent on
second-strike]{.mark} forces has [been]{.mark} a [mantra of]{.mark}
nuclear [strategists since]{.mark} the 19[50s.]{.mark} But it [does not
take into account]{.mark} the [deterrent]{.mark} qualities [of very
small]{.mark} nuclear [arsenals, whose]{.mark} second-strike
[capabilities are,]{.mark} at the very least[, questionable.]{.mark} For
instance, whether [Israel, with]{.mark} its small territory and
potentially [vulnerable nuclear weapon storage sites]{.mark}-whose
general locations are likely to be known to potential adversaries-has a
true second-strike capability may [not be important to the states which
are likely to be targets of an Israeli first
strike]{.mark}.]{.underline} This seems to be a much more significant
factor in Israeli deterrent thinking than second-strike considerations.
16 The assertion that virtual arsenals would be \'unstable\' rests on
the assumption that an arsenal which is not \'ready to go\' would have
uncertain deterrent vCllue. But the example of India\'s and Pakistan\'s
current nuclear capabilities following theirl99S tests, in which their
arsenals may still be small or very small, shows that the smallest
actual arsenal might yet provide a compelling deterrent in the mind of
an adversary whose thinking is guided by deterrence theory. [If only the
capabilities and infrastructure are there, but not the completed
weapons, the [potential may still represent a virtual
deterrent]{.mark}.]{.underline} A more self-interested criticism of
virtual arsenals is the threat they would represent to the international
scams of the smaller European nuclear powers, Britain and France. These
countries have relied on their possession of nuclear weapons to
demonstrate that they are still militarily more capable than other major
conventional powers, Germany being the obvious example. Shorn of
assembled nuclear weapons, in a world in which nations like Germany and
Japan may be pressing for eventual permanent membership of the UN
Security Council, the British and French virtual nuclear arsenals would
seem to be little different from the virtual nuclear capabilities of
other major industrialised countries. Nuclear disarmament would still be
a great leveller, leaving VND postures as the sale measure of the
different status of the former NWS and DFNWS. Britain and-though it does
not care to admit it-France have both relied on their nuclear arsenals
as a key to binding the US to a firm commitment to European security,
For that reason they might be very unhappy about a VND posture and might
therefore insist that the US make an even greater conventional
commitment to Europe\'s defenceadmittedly an unlikely prospect at
present. Trenchant criticisms might also be levelled at VND by Russia,
whose arsenal\'s reliability is being called into question while its
size shrinks. Russia has come to rely on nuclear deterrence as an
increasingly important element of its military posture, while its
conventional armed forces atrophy. Reliable operational nuclear weapons
have also become more important to Russia\'s perceptions of its status,
as the country hecomes weaker. \'I? These factors will also present a
major challenge to the task of persuading Russia to ever take part in
nuclear disarmament, For China, like Russia and the smaller nuclear
p.owers, another central issue in the VND debate would be the potential
of advanced anti-ballistic missile defences to alter the calculus of
VND-especially if, as is highly probable, they form part of a
dual-purpose air defence arsenal in future.IS Waltz raises a more
serious criticism when he suggests that virtual arsenals may not deter
an aggressor from, say, seizing territory and immediately announcing
that it had clandestinely assembled a small nuclear arsenal, thereby
undermining the deterrent potential of an opposing virtual nuclear
capability which would still take some time to transform into the real
thing19 . Schell however argues that the delay in activating a virtual
capability would not matter, as the extent of the delay could never be
known before the event. In effect, this strikes at the nub of a problem
which, in Waltz\'s view, may face virtual arsenals: they may not be
sufficiently threatening to deter \'breakout\' and, if they cannot do
that, how then can they be justified? The answer must lie in relying on
a sufficiently convincing form of VND to dissuade a would-be miscreant
from considering the idea of \'break-out\'. It is presumed that no
rational party to a nuclear disarmament treaty would consider
\'break-out\' unless it felt its vital security interests were at stake.
Even an irrational regime might be dissuaded from breaking out of the
treaty by the possibility of what others, especially former nuclear
powers, will be able to deploy against it. The irrational miscreant
would have no way of knowing that another treaty party has not retained
some form of VND capability. Writing in 1984 Schell presented the
options open to a former nuclear power as insurance against
\'break-out\'. \[n so doing, he also countered the arguments against
VNClVND advanced subsequently by sceptics. In describing the provisions
of an \'abolition\' agreement, Schell effectively argues for the
benefits of VND when he says that a provision of the abolition
agreement:20 \... would permit nations to hold themselves in a
particular, defined state of readiness for nuclear rearmament. This
provision would, in fact, be the very core of the military side of the
agreement. It would be the definition, in technical terms, of what
\'abolition\' was to be. And it would be the final guarantor of the
safety of nations against attack. However, this guarantor would not
defend. It would deter. The most important element in this readiness
would simply be the knowledge of how to make the weapons- knowledge that
nations are powerless to get rid of even if they want to. This un
losable knowledge is \... the root fact of life in the nuclear world,
from which the entire predicament proceeds. But, just as the potential
for nuclear aggression flows from the knowledge, menacing the stability
of the agreement, so does the potential for retaliation, restoring the
stability of the agreement. Its persistence is the reason that
deterrence doesn\'t dissolve when the weapons are abolished. So, if VND,
based on a nation\'s VNC, is a viable option, what types of VND might a
former nuclear weapon state, actual or de facto, expect \[0 have

## Hotlines

### 1NC\-\--Shell

#### Only the CP creates stable US-China dialogue - New hotlines model overcome historical shortfalls.

**Ruhl '24** -- Christian Ruhl, a senior researcher at Founders Pledge
and the fund manager of the Global Catastrophic Risks Fund. ("Beijing is
unavailable to take your call: Why the US-China crisis hotline doesn't
work," Jun. 24, 2024; Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists;

[[No expert]{.mark} I spoke to [was able to confirm whether hotlines
would work even in]{.mark} a non-nuclear [war]{.mark} or a limited
nuclear war.]{.underline} [Many believed the system would fail at this
critical moment for civilization---after hostilities have broken out but
before a conflict has escalated into a total thermonuclear war and
therefore could potentially still be avoided.]{.underline} To negotiate
an end to a war, parties need a way to communicate their
intentions---one that ideally does not involve more bombs. But more
likely than not, **[[hotlines]{.underline}]{.mark}** may
**[[fail]{.underline}]{.mark}** just when we need them most. In fact,
based on all publicly available evidence, [[the odds that hotlines would
fail should a]{.mark} major [war]{.mark} [break out might well be
greater than **50 percent**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Cooperate to communicate. [[Fortunately]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
[[problems with hotlines are]{.mark} all [tractable]{.mark}, and
**[leaders]{.mark}** of both sides [have **signaled their**]{.mark}
[**willingness to discuss** crisis communications]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In May, for example, Zhou Bo, now retired from the Chinese military,
argued that "trust but talk" should be the motto of the US-China
relationship---just as "trust but verify" was the motto of the US-Soviet
relationship during the Cold War---and pointed to the importance of
resuming military-to-military communications.

Policymakers need to acknowledge that the issue is not merely one of
cultural differences or strategic behavior; the problem involves the
very organization of the US-China crisis communications infrastructure
itself, with its 48-hour response allowance and arcane bureaucratic
procedures. The simple [[commitment to "reopen" existing channels is not
enough]{.underline}]{.mark}. The overarching problem with hotlines needs
practical solutions.

First, [[setting up a true]{.mark} US-China [hotline **modeled after the
US-Russia DCL**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and [[designing it for
speed, would solve half of the issue]{.underline}]{.mark} (hotline
slowness). Like the US-Russia DCL, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} true
[[hotline could be text-based]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it could be
limited to nuclear issues (or it could also include other
high-consequence technologies, like artificial intelligence).

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}n improved [[system should]{.mark} also [include
a mechanism for acknowledging receipt of
information]{.mark}]{.underline} without having to formally issue a
reply---a suggestion some analysts already made. As Morris explained to
me, [["just being able to have]{.underline}]{.mark} the \[Chinese
military\] say '[[confirm receipt,' is very
important]{.underline}]{.mark}." There may be situations when even
knowing unilateral technical information has made it to the other side
can help reduce tensions. Such [[information]{.underline}]{.mark} could
[[include messages designed to **reduce warhead
ambiguity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as whether a given weapons system
is armed with a conventional or a nuclear explosive.

The second half of the issue ([[hotline
survivability]{.underline}]{.mark}) may be more challenging to address,
as it [[involves]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[sensitive]{.underline}
[questions about]{.underline}]{.mark} [[nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[effects]{.mark}]{.underline}, nuclear command, control [[and
communications resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, continuity of government
planning, operations in space and cyberspace, and more. But working with
hotlines already requires a certain level of trust. As Morris explained
to me, there is a sealed Chinese encryption box in the Pentagon and a US
encryption device on the other end of the DTL in China, which serve to
ensure the security of communications.

Conducting [[discussions of hotline survivability]{.underline}]{.mark}
would not necessarily require disclosure of sensitive information. For
example, [[agree]{.mark}ing [on a **text-based
system**]{.mark}]{.underline} (rather than videoconference) [[would
**facilitate low-bandwidth communications**]{.underline}]{.mark}, if a
war or natural disaster degrades communications infrastructure. Reaching
an agreement on hotline survivability does not need to include technical
discussions of the related disabling events. Similarly, each side could
agree that it would be prudent to unilaterally harden their terminals,
clearly mark hotline-related infrastructure, and avoid targeting certain
communications systems even in a war---a step that nuclear arms control
advocates have recommended since the Cold War.

However difficult, [[bilateral discussions on]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[issues]{.underline}]{.mark} between the United States and China would
also [[function as a confidence-building tool]{.underline}]{.mark} and
help both sides better understand the causes of their disagreements. In
the latest round of US-China track-2 dialogues earlier this spring,
Santoro recalls witnessing a slight change in tone among some Chinese
participants compared to previous sessions:
[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} strategists now "do **[[see value in
crisis management]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They do think it needs to
happen. They do want better channels.

A cost-benefit [[analysis of Beijing's]{.mark} perceived risks and costs

reluctance to establish military [[hotlines reflect a calculated

should]{.mark} therefore [be seen as deliberate]{.mark}]{.underline}
rather than the result of incompetence. In other words, [[when Beijing
does not]{.mark} [respond, it signals that]{.mark} PRC [leaders do not
see a]{.mark}n immediate [threat]{.mark} of escalation.]{.underline}
Conversely, [[when they do engage, it indicates they]{.mark} [take the
situation seriously and fear potential escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This analysis underscores the critical importance of recognizing
Beijing's distinct approach to military hotlines, suggesting a need to
reassess expectations surrounding their use. [A [deeper understanding
of]{.mark} how the [PRC]{.mark} perceives and uses these communication
[tools]{.mark} can [help avoid misinterpretation and]{.mark} ensure more

Institutionalism and Liberalism -- **[[Arms Control Isn't
Everything]{.underline}]{.mark}** Constructivism is not the only theory
critical of realism. Liberalism and institutionalism offer their own
critiques of realist theory. Critiques from institutionalists have been
validated by the fact that realists failed to predict the willingness of
states to choose to obey the rules of international organizations in the
absence of an effective command mechanism.7 In his reassertion of
realist theory as a counter to institutionalism, Mearsheimer fails to
recognize the strength of international institutions like the European
Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the United Nations
and fails to predict just how enduring they are. It is true that not all
states comply with all of the rules of the United Nations Charter, for
example the United States in 2003 and Russia in 2014 and 2022 expose a
real weakness. Similarly, not every member of NATO spends the required
two percent of their gross domestic product on defense, but none of that
is done "under the radar" or as a secret form of cheating. But despite
their imperfection, no state has withdrawn from the organizations and
all states parrot their written obligations in the charter and/or treaty
as the rules to continue to shape state behavior in the future. Realists
are still waiting for it all to fall apart.8 In their poignant response,
institutionalists Robert Keohane and Lisa Martin point out that realism
is "replete with global generalizations" and the idea that "every state"
seeks to emulate the most powerful in the system is demonstrably false.9
The authors assert that institutions are created by states specifically
because of their "anticipated effects on state behavior."10 This is
contrary to Mearsheimer's realist perspective on relative gains and
cheating.11 In fact, the institutionalists validate part of the
independent variable in this research in relation to international
institutions: establishing norms of interaction among states creates its
own positive feedback loop that generates its own constitutive
power-shaping dynamic. The expectation of reciprocity within an
international organization is a desirable component of its appeal.
**[[Liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** offers a similar position to the
internationalists but with a different emphasis**.** [The theory
[posits]{.mark} domestic drivers and [transnational **social context
influence state behavior**]{.mark} -- that state preferences and the
**state-society relationship** matter **[more than]{.mark}** the
international distribution of **[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.12
Liberalism's assumption that individuals and private groups are the
primary actors in international relations is a clear distinction from
realism.13 The value of liberalism's "bottom-up approach of interest
aggregation that disaggregates the state...into bureaucracies, parties,
or branches of government" is separate from the desire to cooperate
through international institutions but persists as an important
driver.14 The idea that individuals matter in decision-making and an
acknowledgement that states do not have their own agency are critical
pieces to the theory presented in this chapter. Before the theory, it is
necessary to explain a functional decomposition of the final and most
critical piece necessary for building it -- capturing this author's
assessment on the difference between status and power. The Distinction
between Power and Status [And how does status differ from power? This is
perhaps the most difficult question to answer in a research project on
status. [**Power is used to threaten,** with violence, actors to
**behave a certain way**]{.mark} or punish them if they do not.
**Defense is an application of power,** although it is typically
practiced in the form of deterrence first, then if deterrence fails, the
actor uses force to compel the aggressor to stop**.**]{.underline}
Deterrence theory helps explain this concept. Power often refers to
resources or capabilities, physical and material possessions.15
[**[Status]{.mark},** on the other hand, [is a **social**]{.mark}
**phenomenon** and a cognitive **[perception]{.mark}.** In international
relations, status **differs from power** because it is the preservation
[of]{.mark} influence and **[authority to establish]{.mark}** social and
[international **norms that reinforce** ]{.mark}the existing
**[hierarchy]{.mark}** and benefit those with the highest ranking in it.
[Regardless of how the present ranking came into existence, it is not
only power that preserves it]{.mark}. The effects of status become a
constitutive and reinforcing mechanism of **reciprocated identity** and
recognition behavior; meaning, [if an actor is]{.mark} consistently
[treated as a **"less than,"** but]{.mark} they **[perceive they deserve
better]{.mark},** then **compensating** for [that deficit will]{.mark}
be **a [motivat]{.mark}ing factor** in the actor's
[behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. The target of the actor's behavior is
the "other" who they are trying to influence. Although there is obvious
competition within the existing hierarchies, it mostly falls short of
conflict. Thomas Schelling is one of the founding fathers of deterrence
theory. We often associate deterrence with nuclear weapons, which is
appropriate, but nuclear deterrence is not the only application of
deterrence theory. First, if we accept Schelling's theory, **[deterrence
is a form of coercion. One actor's input into the system is intended to
shape another actor's perceptions,]{.underline}** resulting in the
second actor refraining from an action that is undesirable to the first
actor. Let's call the actors State A and State B and let's postulate
that State A and B have a dispute over some territory in a contested
sphere of influence. Status quo would preserve the disputed territory as
neutral and is supported by State A. State B wants to change the status
quo and exert its authority in the disputed area, eventually absorbing
it into its own territory. Even though State B would benefit from the
action State A wants to prevent, because of State A's input into the
system of interaction, e.g. the international system, defense of the
disputed territory, and galvanized support for State A and the status
quo, let's assume in the short-term State B is deterred from taking that
action. There are a few possible reasons for this outcome. First, State
B believes that following through will result in unacceptable costs
levied by State A and its partners that State B is unwilling to pay or
unable to withstand. In this case, the cost of action outweighs the
benefit of action, in the short term. It is possible State B would begin
preparations to be able to absorb the cost in the future, but State A
can also adjust its activities to make that more difficult. A second
possible reason State B is deterred is their perception that the benefit
of restraint outweighs the benefit of action. Restraint will help them
bide their time until more favorable conditions or their objective
changes. In both cases, State A sets the conditions where State B
believes it is not the time to annex the disputed territory. In this
example, [[**deterrence** can take the form of **threats**]{.mark} of
punishment or denial**, [but the threat of violence is not conflict; it
is coercion]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Deterrence is intended to prevent an
outcome and in this example between States A and B, it worked. [If we
take the same example a step further, let's say that State A was unable
to shape State B's perception that the cost would be too much to bear if
State B were to annex the disputed territory**.**]{.underline} State B
was willing to pay whatever anticipated cost would be incurred, possibly
because State A's threats were not credible. Additionally, the cost of
restraint and 47 perception of future risk was so high that State B was
unwilling to accept the status quo any longer. State B invades the
disputed area. Now State A has to make a choice: accept State B's
actions or compel them to stop. Acceptance would damage State A's
credibility even more than State B's escalation already did, and
compelling State B to stop will require escalation from State A that
risks conflict with State B. Compellence requires the application of
force or other measures across the instruments of power (like sanctions)
to stop State B's behavior. This is another form of coercion, but this
time it is taking an action to force a change in State B's behavior.
Deterrence failed; the next step is to follow through on the threats to
compel State B to stop by imposing further costs and threatening
unacceptable risk.16 There is no clear, obvious, and distinct method of
applying status as an effective tool for compellence[**.** Status exists
in social interactions relative to the actors engaging with each other.
In the first part of the example, once can infer that State A enjoyed
the ability to preserve its influence and authority to reinforce social
and international norms that supported the existing hierarchy. [Even
if]{.mark} we assume [State A has more **material capability to
fight**]{.mark} **in a conflict**[, their power was **not enough to
convince State B**]{.mark} not to invade in the second part of the
example. [The **only variable that changed** was State B's
**perception.** Each state's ability to wield its material power
remained **static**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} When power manifests as
the employment of military or other capabilities, is becomes a tool for
compellence. When it is not used, it is a symbol of
status**[.]{.underline}** Remember, status evokes voluntary deference.17
[Status can be an effective tool in coercion, defined as the threat of
or use of force,]{.underline} but harder to apply when it comes to
compellence, which is the use of force to stop another's behavior and
return to the status quo ex ante or compel a new status quo. This
distinction is critical to the theory presented in this research. Once
the ideas of power and status are deconstructed, the nuance that status
and power are distinctly different can be observed. Leveraging status is
a form of influence, persuasion, manipulation, or possibly coercion. The
application of power to coerce is to compel. The ability to threaten
with military power to deny or punish requires actual military power,
but rather than assume conflict where there is a status deficit, as
other scholars cited in this work have done, this research makes no such
assumption. Plainly put, power enables more effective coercion in order
to deter or compel behavior in another state. Status enables influence
in the cognitive domain. [[If we consider]{.mark} a spectrum that spans
[**day-to-day competition** among states]{.mark}, from peace through
war, enjoying status superior to others is one possible way [to **shape
the perceptions of others**]{.mark}. It [could be through coercion,
**but it would not be through**]{.mark} **compellence by using [military
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Coercion comes in many forms and
the states with the highest comparative ranking, the most secure
identities, and consistent voluntary deference enables many different
types of influence[**.** If we look at the nuclear weapons states,
possession of nuclear weapons does not equate to equal status among the
reference group**.**]{.underline} Nuclear weapons are not the only
variable that confers status in the system, but they are the variable
examined here. [**[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea** [is a nuclear weapons
state]{.mark} labeled as a rogue nation, led by a dictator **[desperate
for recognition from the West]{.mark},** whose policy has been keeping
its thumb on the North Korean economy]{.underline} in response to Kim
Jong-Un's egregious domestic policies. [In the case of North Korea,
nuclear proliferation has not yet achieved reciprocated status from the
existing hierarchy and therefore [the regime will **continue**
]{.mark}**its [status-seeking behavior ]{.mark}**[by continuing to grow
its nuclear arsenal]{.mark} until it is sufficient to achieve the
desired effect**.**]{.underline} Perhaps North Korea and its leader will
be taken more seriously by the West when their status matches their
desired identity perception. The process where this change happens will
be messy and obscure and one should not assume all status-holders will
49 look or apply their status the same way. The shift will not happen in
a vacuum, and this is where material capabilities, (i.e. power) enhance
and enable the desired cognitive effect: voluntary deference to their
new status position. North Korea's actions can be classified as an
emulation of dominant powers, a social identity method for achieving
social mobility that equates to a change in status ranking. [Because
North Korea still suffers a status deficit and the salience of nuclear
weapons continues to persist, it follows that North Korea will **remain
on its path of proliferation.**]{.underline}

### AT: Revisionism

#### Russia and China are [NOT]{.underline} revisionist powers. Their affirmation of international order contradicts revisionist aims.

**Wilson 2019**--Jeanne L. Wilson is an Emeritus Professor of Political
Science at Wheaton College, Norton, MA. Previously, she was the Shelby
Cullom Davis Chair of Russian Studies at Wheaton. Her research interests
are focused on aspects of the Russian-Chinese relationship with an
emphasis on their convergent status in the international political
system. She is especially interested in issues of identity and the
significance of the increasingly asymmetric disparity in power relations
between the two states. "Are Russia and China Revisionist States?" (June
11, 2019)
<https://theasiadialogue.com/2019/06/11/are-russia-and-china-revisionist-states////>
newsciabo

In the past few years, Russia and China have increasingly been referred
to as revisionist powers. For example, both the [United States' 2017
National Security
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf)
and the [United States' 2018 National Defence
Strategy](https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf)
identify Russia and China as revisionist states. The concept of
revisionism encompasses various meanings that typically distinguish
between states that accept the status quo distribution of power in the
international system and those which seek to alter it to their
advantage. Here, I am primarily concerned with the extent to which
Russia and China challenge the implicit assumptions that underpin the
norms and values of what might be referred to as the international
community in the English School sense of the term**.** [I argue that
[Russia and China]{.mark} are not revisionist but rather
**[neo-revisionist states. ]{.mark}**]{.underline}However, it is China
rather than Russia that is more likely substantively to challenge the
status quo and assume the position of a full-blown revisionist power in
the future. Both Western analysts and policymakers have identified a
litany of Russian and Chinese behaviour that indicates nonconformance to
what is portrayed as universal norms and values. [In fact, Russia and
China contest a set of neoliberal practices that have evolved in the
post-World War Two international order.]{.underline} Foremost amongst
these is the evolution of human rights as a universal value that
legitimizes intervention in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state
(although Russia has made use of the rhetoric of the "responsibility to
protect" to justify its activities in the post-Soviet space). Russia and
China similarly view the West's elevation of liberal democracy as a
universal ideal as a subterfuge for the fomenting of Colour Revolutions
that seek regime change in noncompliant targeted states.

[At the same time, Russia and China [accept]{.mark} and in fact
**[continuously]{.mark}** reaffirm [**their commitment** to]{.mark} a
number of fundamental precepts of the [international order]{.mark}.
These include the primacy of **state sovereignty** and **territorial
integrity**, the importance of **international law**, and the
**centrality of the** United Nations, particularly with [respect]{.mark}
to the key [role of the **United Nations Security
Council**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It must be acknowledged that Russian and
Chinese promotion of these concepts does not necessarily provide a
reliable guide to their foreign policy behaviour (although the same
criticism can be lodged against countless other states). [Russia and
China [also **actively participate** in]{.mark} aspects of [**global
governance**]{.mark}, placing an **emphasis** on the United Nations as
the **ultimate** source of **international authority.** Both states have
**signed a number** of United Nations Conventions and Covenants
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They
are **members of a number of multilateral and regional
structures**]{.underline} (although Russia has been suspended from
participation in the G-7)[. The two states **[stress]{.mark}** their
[**commitment** to the maintenance of **global and regional
security**]{.mark} supporting the **[non-prolif]{.mark}eration [of
nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons]{.mark}**, **the non-militarization of space,**
and the need to **fight terrorism.** Critically, Russia and China **[act
as rule takers rather than challengers]{.mark}** in their participation
in the global financial institutions. **China**, in particular, has
emerged as a **vocal supporter of globalization** and free trade in
conspicuous **contrast to the** United States in the **Trump**
administration. [Russia and China]{.mark}'s view of the operation of the
international system conforms in a large part to Westphalian precepts,
while **[reject]{.mark}ing [the West's]{.mark} more recent adoption of
humanitarian and [individualistic]{.mark} norms and
[values]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which in fact exist in a state of uneasy
tension with the traditional assumptions of the Westphalian order). In
this sense, Russia and China are neo-revisionist rather than revisionist
states.

Under the Xi Jinping leadership, China has adopted a more assertive
foreign policy that, in contrast to the behaviour of past leadership,
confidently asserts China's status as a great power. On the one hand,
this is reflected in the State's efforts to readjust China's role in
international structures, as seen in the attempt to expand its
decision-making power within the International Monetary Fund. This sort
of behaviour, however, takes place within the boundaries of the
contemporary international community. On the other hand, China's
launching of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 can be viewed as
offering an alternative vision of global governance that challenges the
approach promoted by the hegemonic Western powers. Beijing has offered a
number of rationales for BRI which are in themselves at least in part
persuasive. This massive infrastructure project can be seen as a means
of developing China's Western regions, utilizing surplus capital and
providing employment, extending Chinese export markets, and securing
domestic energy supplies. Generally speaking, the Chinese leadership has
sought to downplay the strategic and geopolitical implications of BRI.

#### Russia and China are [NOT]{.underline} revisionist nations. Their continued maintenance of the current international system disproves this narrative.

After a quarter century of stasis, the pattern of world order is
changing. The inter-cold war period of the cold peace is giving way not
to a thaw, but to the re-entrenchment of bipolar confrontation. Like the
First Cold War, the second is also about the conflicting views of world
order, although the language and modalities differ. The U.S.-led liberal
international order is challenged by the emergence of a putative
anti-hegemonic alignment (Sakwa 2017). [This phenomenon is much bigger
than simply the **re-emergence of China as a global actor or Russia's
neo-revisionist stance that challenges the practices of the previously

adopted elements of the neo-revisionist position, and this provides the
ideational framework for the emerging anti-hegemonic world order.
Members of this nascent alignment stress that it is not directed against
anyone.]{.underline} The stated goal is to restore balance in world
affairs within the framework not simply of multipolarity (although
polycentrism, as Russians put it, is a key value), but through a
positive agenda of a new model of international relations. [The
alignment is thus not "counter" hegemonic, which would simply replicate
the existing pattern of international behaviour, but "anti" hegemonic,
questioning the very idea that a single state and its allies can claim
"primacy" in world affairs or that their ideology can be considered
universal.]{.underline} This position was already implicitly asserted in
1945 in the Yalta system of great power relationships, but was then
"democratised" through the principles enunciated in the Helsinki Final
Act of August 1975. In the First Cold War, the U.S.- led liberal
international order was challenged by the Soviet bloc within the
framework of a bipolar international order, but in the post-1989 period,
the assertion of unipolarity undermined the principles of both Yalta and
Helsinki (Ikenberry 2011). Today the aspirations for multipolarity are
embedded in the broader emergence of two contesting visions of world
order (Smith 2013). The confrontation between the expansive liberal
international order and the 2 resistance of a group of states provoked
the Second Cold War. [The [Trump phenomenon]{.mark} then emerged as an
intervening variable, challenging both post-war [representations of
American hegemony and]{.mark} those who were coalescing in [resistance
to it.]{.mark}]{.underline} This chapter seeks to explore Russia's
perceptions regarding the emergence of an antihegemonic world order at a
time when the stasis in the international system is being replaced by
dynamics of change. The first section discusses the end of stasis in the
international system and how Russia responds to it -- particularly in
terms of its relations with the West. [The second section elaborates on
the factors shaping [Russia's distinct neo-revisionism]{.mark} which has
emerged largely as a [reaction to the absence]{.mark} of transformation
of the [European security system at the end of the Cold
War.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The third section focuses on the dynamics of
change in the international system and the way [Russia]{.mark} tries to
[redefine its relations with the West]{.mark} as well **as other rising
powers like China.**]{.underline} The International System and the End
of Stasis The emergence of a putative alternative model of world order
promises to disrupt the long stasis in international affairs that
predominated since 1945. Although 1989 brought important changes to the
practice of international politics, the international system was not
fundamentally transformed (Pouliot 2010). [Equally, the current period
of [dynamic change]{.mark} is not intended by the key subaltern actors
[to revise the international system but only its practices.]{.mark} This
is why Russia and China are not revisionist powers, but
[**neo-revisionist: seeking to change how the existing works rather than
changing the system itself.**]{.mark} In the quarter century of the
inter-Cold War years (1989-2014), otherwise known as the period of the
cold peace, the liberal international order became more ambitious
(within the framework of the ideology of globalisation and the "end of
history"), but the post-1945 order prevailed]{.underline}. The main
process after 1989 was the "enlargement" of the liberal order
accompanied by extensive claims to hegemony. From that perspective, 1989
did not represent such a radical break, other than for the countries
directly involved. Only after the expanding liberal order "hit reality"
has some rethinking begun (Mearsheimer 2018).

Amid the US relative decline, Russia has violated the 1945 UN Charter's
prohibition against the use of force and other fundamental tenets of the
rules‐based order by invading Ukraine, first by its annexation of Crimea
and attack on Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and later by the full‐scale
invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. This study examines how
Russia's violent break with the world order affects a regional part of
the establishment, namely the institutions and arrangements that can be
conceptualized as Arctic regional governance (e.g., Heininen et al.,
2015; Wilson Rowe, 2020) or an Arctic regime complex (Young, 2012).
These concepts comprise treaties, inter‐governmental organizations,
non‐governmental organizations, non‐state actors, transnational
networks, ad hoc arrangements, and/or informal arenas for regional
interaction. [While Moscow may regard the prevailing world order---still
widely referred to as the liberal international order--- as unfavorable,
[Russia]{.mark} has shown **[strong support]{.mark}** for a
**[rules‐based order in the Arctic]{.mark}** region. Developments in the
law of the sea from 1945 through the 1970s added vast maritime areas to
the jurisdiction of the coastal state.]{.underline} The legal concepts
of a 200 nautical‐mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the continental
shelf, which in Russia's case extends far into the Central Arctic Ocean,
put an unimaginable wealth of natural resources exclusively in Russian
hands. The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea further allows the
Kremlin to regulate international shipping through ice‐covered seas
inside Russia's EEZ, that is, most of the Northeast Passage (UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, Art. 234). [In its 2022 maritime
doctrine, Moscow concluded that maritime **[sovereign rights]{.mark},**
obtained through gradual developments in the law of the sea, had become
[**vital to Russia's security** and]{.mark} **its very
[existence]{.mark}** (Russia Maritime Studies Institute, 2022). In
addition to legal developments, [Russia]{.mark} has played a defining
**role** in exclusive forums that have [set]{.mark} the [**regional
agenda and shaped Arctic governance**]{.mark} (Pedersen,
2012).]{.underline} These include the Arctic Council (the Arctic Eight),
established as the preeminent forum for international cooperation in the
region, and the even more exclusive ad hoc constellation of states
littoral to the Arctic Ocean (the Arctic Five, i.e., Russia together
with the US, Canada, Denmark, and Norway; Pedersen, 2012). In Ilulissat
in 2008, the Arctic Five solemnly proclaimed they had a unique and
special stewardship role that derived from their "sovereignty, sovereign
rights, and jurisdiction in large parts of the Arctic Ocean" (Danish
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2008, p. 1)[. Other regional arrangements,
equally favorable to Russia, have included formal and informal
arrangements with other Arctic states pertaining to issues such as
fisheries, search and rescue, socio‐economic development, and nuclear
proliferation.]{.underline} While Russia is a self‐declared revisionist
state in the global system, scholars assert that Russia is a status quo
advocate in an Arctic regional sub‐system (e.g., Exner‐Pirot & Murray,
2017, p. 59). Summarized by Konyshev and Sergunin (2014), most Russian
experts argue that: [[Moscow **does not pursue a revisionist policy in
the Arctic**]{.mark}. On the contrary, [**Russia is a status quo power**
which wants]{.mark} to solve all disputes in this region by
**[peace]{.mark}ful means, with the [help of international law and
international organizations.]{.mark}**]{.underline} (p. 324) This study
finds that Russia's seemingly incompatible mix of revisionist and status
quo ambitions may prove to be just that---incompatible. Data for the
following analysis has been drawn from governmental strategies and
policies, Arctic Council archive documents, member states' chairmanship
programs, academic publications, reports, new articles, and
commentaries.

Arctic Governance: Between Revisionism and the Status Quo

This section will argue that [[China's]{.mark} approach to]{.underline}
Arctic [[governance]{.underline}]{.mark} is also marked by [[dialectical
thinking about]{.underline}]{.mark} striking **[a [balance
between]{.mark}]{.underline}** preserving **[the [s]{.mark}tatus [quo
and revisionism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Previous [studies]{.underline}
have [characterised China as]{.underline} a 'mildly [revisionist Arctic
power']{.underline} that 'challenges the rules and norms protecting the
exclusive rights of circumpolar states' (Rainwater Citation2013, 77) and
argued that China will 'insist on having a say on any new Arctic
governance measures' (Brady Citation2017, 198). Kossa (Citation2024,
117) notes that '[Chinese analysts]{.underline} and academics are more
[vocal in]{.underline} their [criticisms of]{.underline} the
**[current]{.underline}** state of [**Arctic governance'** than the
official discourse]{.underline}. The subsequent section will argue that
the discernible tension between revisionism and adherence to the status
quo should also be understood in terms of dialectical thinking. Building
upon the interpretation that Beijing aims to preserve international
legal frameworks that facilitate its Arctic engagement while
simultaneously advocating for normative changes that would better
accommodate its interests, this section will argue that the two
aspirations are seen as noncontradictory and mutually supportive.

In the exploratory keyness analysis of academic articles, the terms
'Arctic governance' (beiji zhili) and governance mechanisms, such as
'UNCLOS' and 'Arctic Council', emerged more frequently than in the
reference corpus, indicating their significance for qualitative
research. Although China's rights and interests in the Arctic are
substantiated by UNCLOS and international law generally, in order to
exercise these rights, China must engage with other international
institutions, such as the AC. The prominence of the AC within this
discourse is arguably incommensurate with the actual role it plays as a
soft law governance mechanism. Figure 4 shows that governance was
initially barely conceptualised in the discourse (although there was
interest in environmental protection mechanisms), but it rapidly grew in
prominence, with 83% of articles mentioning it in 2022. Initially, the
percentage of academic articles concerned with UNCLOS was significantly
higher than those mentioning the AC, but over time, the AC gained a
prominent position, with as many as 72% of all articles mentioning it in
2022. A common view among Chinese scholars is that China faces a dilemma
in that [[appearing as]{.mark} a [revisionist]{.mark} power is
[unappealing]{.mark}, but]{.underline} the [[current
system]{.underline}]{.mark} of governance **[[does not]{.mark} reflect
Chinese [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** or the [common heritage of
humanity]{.underline} (Cheng Citation2012b; Yang Citation2018).

and the Arctic Council, 2007--2022.

\*FIG 4 OMITTED

Arctic governance is a point of contestation in Chinese discourse.
[Realist accounts hold]{.underline} that there is [not much point in
China engaging]{.underline} with Arctic governance as such because it is
ultimately geopolitical considerations that dictate the political
landscape (Ye Citation2012). Within an anarchical international order,
efforts should be concentrated on using opportunities as they present
themselves, as well as strengthening bilateral relations with Arctic
countries in an effort to gain the upper hand in this geopolitical
struggle (Lu Citation2010, 329--337). Although not mainstream, [these
accounts reflected]{.underline} the [**widespread [sentiment]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} while it could be advantageous for China to
gain a seat in the AC as an observer, ultimately, '**[[China can
transcend]{.underline}]{.mark}** (chaoyue) [**[the A]{.mark}rctic
[C]{.mark}ouncil'** and exercise its rights in the region]{.underline}
through other platforms (Guo and Sun Citation2013, 134).
Institutionalist accounts [also [criticised]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[status quo]{.mark} in [Arctic governance]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, the [AC]{.underline} was [described as]{.underline} **[having a
'congenital' defect]{.underline}** (xiantianxing quexian). This was
because the council was not an international organisation and lacked
legally binding obligations and regulations. At that time, participation
was also limited to Arctic countries and there was no permanent
secretariat or long-term funding (Cheng Citation2012a; Guo and Young
Citation2012).

Initially, [Chinese scholars agreed]{.underline} that the [current
system]{.underline} of Arctic governance was [built on]{.underline} the
principle of **[excluding external actors]{.underline}** from platforms
such as the AC (Cheng Citation2013; Chen, Tao, and Qin Citation2011;
Xiao Citation2014; Ye Citation2012) or fisheries management (Zhao
Citation2013, Citation2016). The [[institutionalist
understanding]{.mark} of exclusion]{.underline} (paita, paiwai)
[[emphasised]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[barriers to Chinese
participation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Arctic governance. In contrast,
the [realist understanding]{.underline} of exclusion as it [relates to
[resources and rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline} in consumption has been
systematised primarily in terms of the economic rights and interests
that China already has, including scientific exploration, navigation and
resource development (Lu and Zhang Citation2016). Exclusion was seen as
the reason for the unwillingness to grant China observer status before
2013, despite the fact that [[China]{.mark} had [attended AC
meetings]{.mark}]{.underline} as an ad hoc observer **[[since
2006]{.underline}]{.mark}** and had sought full observer status since
2007. [Further development]{.underline} of the AC building up to
[China's [admission as]{.mark} a [permanent observer]{.mark} in
2013]{.underline}, such as the 2011 Nuuk Declaration and the
establishment of a permanent secretariat in Tromsø, [[boosted]{.mark}
the [importance of the council as]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[focus of
Chinese diplomatic efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Sun and Guo
Citation2012). Increased coope[ration between Arctic states]{.underline}
at the expense of non-Arctic states had thus been [seen as an attempt to
exclude]{.underline} [external actors]{.underline} (Liu Citation2014;
Sun and Guo Citation2012; Sun and Wang Citation2014b).

The [[acceptance]{.underline}]{.mark} of China as an AC observer has
[[strengthened Chinese]{.mark} scholars' [confidence **in the
s**]{.mark}**tatus [quo]{.mark}**, resulting in]{.underline} a
[dialectical synthesis between the s]{.underline}tatus [quo
and]{.underline} the **[desire to reform]{.underline}** it. Some
scholars have interpreted [these moves [as]{.mark}]{.underline} a final
**[[recognition of China's position a]{.mark}s a [stakeholder]{.mark} in
the Arctic]{.underline}** (Liu Citation2014; Sun Citation2014; Sun and
Zhang Citation2016; Xiao Citation2014). The decision-maker-oriented
academic publication The Blue Book on the Arctic concludes that although
the observer system is an equilibrium between Arctic and non-Arctic
states, [it [is a 'cooperative game]{.mark} situation [that
expands]{.mark}]{.underline} the actual and potential [**[interests of
all parties]{.underline}**']{.mark} and is thus positive (Ma
Citation2015, 318). Xu (Citation2017), 8), the [director of]{.underline}
the Treaty and Law Department of the Ministry of [Foreign Affairs of
China]{.underline}, underscored in an academic article that '[[China
supports]{.underline}]{.mark} the [advancement of Ar[ctic governance
**in compliance with**]{.mark} **the basic principles of [international
law]{.mark}**]{.underline} and internationally recognised norms'
[to]{.underline} 'continuously [improve [and]{.mark} develop [the
**rules-based Arctic**]{.mark} **governance
[system']{.mark}**]{.underline}. This translated into [increased
optimism about]{.underline} China's equal role in [new governance
mechanisms]{.underline}, such as the CAOFA (Bai and Zhuang Citation2017;
Fu Citation2021). [In line with]{.underline} the official aim of
'[guiding the international community]{.underline} to jointly shape a
more just and reasonable new international order' (Ribao Citation2017,
para. 1), [[contributing to]{.mark} Arctic
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline} by 'China's wisdom and power' (Zhongguo
zhihui he Zhongguo liliang) has become **[firmly established [as]{.mark}
an [official policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (China's Arctic Policy

Xi Jinping's announcement of three global initiatives since 2021 has
sparked considerable debate about Beijing's articulation of the
international order. However, much of the analysis and commentary
surrounding these initiatives have focused on the degree to which they
illustrate China's revisionism. As a result, they fall short in three
regards.

[First, the **[status quo-revisionist binary]{.mark} is inherently
[[flawed]{.mark}](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02185377.2020.1837193)**
as a means of assessing state intentions. This is particularly important
when the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**, the [assumed status quo
power]{.mark} and architect of the existing order, [has]{.mark} often
**[taken actions that are
[revisionist](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300257281/pacific-power-paradox/).]{.mark}**
Second, these analyses implicitly **assume** that **international
orders** are **static** rather than fluid and **multilayered.**
[Historically]{.mark}, [international order]{.mark}s and their
constituent parts have been contested or [interpreted
differently]{.mark} by other actors, the post-WWII order is no
different. Third, and more importantly, such narratives [do not
account]{.mark} for the ways in which these initiatives integrate a
series of long-standing discourses that articulate [**Beijing's
interpretation** of the international order.]{.mark} The origins of
these discourses and their content, as well as how Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) officials mobilize them, matter -- they not only reveal
**China's understanding and preferences of the international order, but
also China's role and place within it.**]{.underline} In this context,
the announcement speeches, subsequent official statements, and white
papers of the Global
[Development](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202109/22/WS614a8126a310cdd39bc6a935.html),
[Security](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230221_11028348.html),
and
[Civilization](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202303/16/WS6412496da31057c47ebb4b23.html)
Initiatives reveal (1) the integration of prior discourses; (2) the
preference and promotion of a multipolar international system; and (3)
the preference and promotion of particularistic universalism.
Integration of Discourses

The [Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence](http://ir.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/dtxw/201407/t20140702_1894012.htm#:~:text=The%20Five%20Principles%20of%20Peaceful%20Co%2DExistence%20are%3A%20mutual%20respect,mutual%20benefit%2C%20and%20peaceful%20coexistence.)
have been a foundational component of China's foreign policy discourse
for decades. [To that end, [Chinese officials]{.mark} make regular
[state]{.mark}ments on the [**importance of sovereignty,** territorial
integrity, **non-interference,** mutual benefit, and **peaceful
coexistence**]{.mark} during diplomatic summits with their
counterparts.]{.underline} It is, therefore, unsurprising that various
components of these principles have made their way into key policy
slogans like the "[Community with a Shared Future for
Mankind](https://english.news.cn/20230323/6d411c2465664137a7ad8e45ac0de8da/c.html),"
the "[Silk Road
Spirit](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/14/c_136282982.htm),"
and ultimately, the three global initiatives. These principles have also
intersected with another official discourse that links security and
development. This security-development nexus is a discourse contending
that security issues are the product of underdevelopment and advocates
for the centrality of the CCP. While it originated as a mechanism for
domestic governance in China, over the past few decades, Chinese
officials have
[externalized](https://www.routledge.com/Chinas-Western-Frontier-and-Eurasia-The-Politics-of-State-and-Region-Building/Garcia/p/book/9780367694449)
this discourse as part of China's foreign policy.

[The intersection of the principles of peaceful coexistence and the
security-development nexus produces another discourse advocating for
non-interference in a country's political and economic development.
Consequently, China's [foreign policy discourse promotes **respect for
plurality,** ]{.mark}while simultaneously [seeking]{.mark} international
cooperation on the grounds of **[development and stability]{.mark}** in
the spirit of mutual benefit, all of which are **viewed [as a form of
shared interest. ]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In other words, China's global initiatives have become the most recent
embodiment of two foundational discourses that have been mobilized by
the CCP for several decades. As a result, they reveal a preference for
multipolarity as well as a particularistic form of universality.

"True Multilateralism" and Multipolarity While none of the three
initiatives directly address polarity as a central theme in the way that
other policy statements have, they implicitly reject unipolarity and its
associated American hegemony. [This is [evident in]{.mark} their appeals
to multilateralism to solve common global issues and the
[centering]{.mark} of the [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations and its
bodies as the platform to facilitate this process.]{.underline}

For example, Xi Jinping's
[statement](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202109/22/WS614a8126a310cdd39bc6a935.html)
to the U.N. General Assembly in 2021, which focused on development,
contended that the United Nations "should hold high the banner of true
multilateralism and serve as the platform for countries to jointly
safeguard universal security, share development achievements and chart
the course for the future world." The
[concept](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230221_11028348.html)
paper for the Global Security Initiative also contends that the purpose
and principles of the U.N. Charter can only be maintained and
implemented if all countries practice true multilateralism. [These
repeated [references]{.mark} to "[true multilateralism]{.mark}"
represent an implicit [**critique of** what **Beijing** perceives as
**American unilateralism, and therefore actions destabilizing to the
international order.** ]{.mark}]{.underline}By appealing to
multilateralism Beijing is promoting a multipolar order that aims to
restrain that behavior. Furthermore, it centers China as a key player in
that multipolar order.

The Paradox of Particularistic Universalism Through their embodiment of
China's longstanding foreign policy discourses, these three initiatives
also represent a critique of Western universalism and the role it plays
in the international order. A particular point of contention for Beijing
has been the West's efforts to promote liberal democracy and neoliberal
economics in the Global South. While these initiatives do not explicitly
reject such forms of organizing political and economic life, they aim to
provide discursive space for greater plurality by recognizing the
multiple different trajectories of political and economic development of
all countries. Paradoxically, despite their critique of Western
universalism through the promotion of particularity, it is evident that
these initiatives incorporate a measure of universality as well. For
example, the Global Development and Security Initiatives inherently view
development and security as co-constitutive. In other words, there is a
universal link between the two. Furthermore, the [Global Civilization
Initiative](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202303/16/WS6412496da31057c47ebb4b23.html),
in its reference to the diversity and particularity of peoples and
places, advocates for common values such as "peace, development, equity,
justice, democracy and freedom."

[In essence, to the extent that universalism exists in [Chinese
visions]{.mark} of the international order, it is [one **devoid of the
promotion** of]{.mark} liberal values as [interpreted]{.mark} and
promoted [by]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** and the
[West]{.mark} more [broadly.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Implications [Ultimately, while there are **inevitable disconnects**
between, and within, words and actions, these initiatives represent the
discursive mechanism through which Chinese officials articulate their
preferences for the international order and, therefore, warrant deeper
engagement. Importantly, their **articulation** of the international
order **precludes the binary of status quo-revisionist power
competition.** In a traditional sense, [China cannot be]{.mark} a
[revisionist]{.mark} power [if it **centers core bodies and principles
of the existing order** in their vision of the
future.]{.mark}]{.underline} This complicates general arguments that
China seeks to upend the existing system. However, China is not a status
quo power either. [Despite centering key international bodies like the
U.N. and associated institutions, the promotion of **multipolarity and
particularistic universalism** indicates that Chinese officials seek to
**erode** what they view as **American hegemony** and the centrality of
the **Western liberal values** the U.S. promotes as
universal.]{.underline}

China's foreign policy discourse does not necessarily represent an
inherent threat to international order per se. After all, the
international order has never been static and has always had competing
interpretations, including by officials in Washington. However, these
global initiatives do challenge the current dominant interpretation of
the international order promoted by the United States. which is espoused
in its "rules-based order" discourse. Consequently, to the extent that
the current order must be unipolar and defined by universalist Western
liberal values, China clearly represents a challenge.

### AT: Hard Power Key

#### Hard power is [counterintuitive]{.underline} to deterrence -- and exacerbated by Trump's realist strategies

[President Donald [**Trump** marked]{.mark} a clear **departure of
interventionism.** [Principled **realism**]{.mark}**,** the idea that
the **nation-state, not an interventionist hegemon,** was the center of
analysis. [The **America First model**]{.mark} **hoped to [protect
American interests]{.mark}** and leadership. For instance, Trump
pressured allies to the point of **threatening the
relationship**]{.underline}. NATO members were told to meet their 2%
military spending requirement and instructed to 2 THE PROBLEM OF
IDEOLOGY IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY 35 stop buying oil from Russia.
Trump also brought an increasingly aggressive China to the forefront.
[[The image of the **"ugly American" was front and center**]{.mark}, and
it was clear that [Trump was **sacrificing "soft power" for**]{.mark}
economic security and **[military influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Steff & Tidwell, 2020). Ultimately, [**[American exceptionalism
was]{.mark}** still **[clearly presented]{.mark}**, as the America First
model defends American security and interests over the concerns of
others]{.underline}. If the United States did well, others would follow.
If anyone were to challenge the United States under Trump, they would
meet the fate of Qassam Soleimani. Trump also respected the enemies of
the United States. He reached out to Kim Jong Un in an effort to settle
matters, but also insulted his manhood. [This strategy seemed **[similar
to]{.mark} President Richard [Nixon's madman strategy: remaining
unpredictable to establish deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Boys,
2021). With the Covid-19 pandemic and BLM protests, it was clear that
Americans wanted something more normal. Normalcy was equated with Joseph
Biden. He won the election handedly. Biden's presidency was rife with
foreign policy disaster: from the chaotic Afghan withdrawal (2021) to
the Russia-Ukraine War (2022), to the Israel-Iran proxy war (2023) to
the spy-balloons, the Biden administration faced serious humiliations
that the United States, the most powerful state on earth backed by
American exceptionalism, simply could not neutralize. These humiliations
may have led to the reelection of Trump. As of writing, it is very
difficult to predict the next four years. In all, the ideas of American
exceptionalism was truly brought out during the Bush administration. It
is the ability of the United States to be the chief decision-maker,
governing its international order. Decisionism is the appropriation of
jus bellum, suspending peace to save peace; democratic peace: the more
democracies, the safer the United States becomes. The interesting notion
is that American power is not simply to preserve its democracy, but to
preserve power for generations to come. [In many ways, the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[behavior today is similar
to]{.mark}** the United States [behavior **during the Cold
War.**]{.mark} Many have pointed out that American behavior has
**deviated from its initial vision of isolation,** particularly steering
away from permanent alliances]{.underline} (Kupchan, 2020; Wertheim,
2020). Of course, the nature of the international system was very
different during Washington's time. For example, President Dwight
Eisenhower understood that the nature of war had changed with the advent
of nuclear weapons and other rapidly evolving technologies. Both
presidents, however, perceived specific perspectives in American foreign
policy taking root that were 36 H. S. KASSAB not in the best interests
of the country. Washington wanted the United States to refrain from any
permanent alliances in Europe while Eisenhower warned of the unchecked
power of the military-industrial complex, connections between the
Department of Defense and other bureaucratic agencies to defense
companies**.** [Together, these two presidents warned of [losing
the]{.mark} main [**democratic vision** of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates[: to remain **liberal and democratic, but also free of
overextension**]{.mark}**.** In many ways, **[those two issues have
combined]{.mark}** together to create the landscape faced today by
American foreign policy decision-makers. However, one might make the
argument that **[democracy should promote itself. It is not necessary to
have to embark on crusades]{.mark} to spread democracy.**]{.underline}
Before we make this argument, it is important to note common traits
between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding decisionism.

#### **Hard power deterrence [uniquely]{.underline} fails for states like the US -- creates a [double standard]{.underline} with liberal governance and realist strategies.**

[The most prevalent factor linking deterrence and diplomacy is **the
role of diplomacy in communicating deterrence.** Power is at the heart
of deterrence and it can come **[in the form of hard]{.mark} power,**
underwritten by the coercive capability of military force**, [or]{.mark}
in the form of [non-hard power]{.mark}, through the use of political or
economic threats or inducements**]{.underline}. The reference to
non-hard power is to distinguish it from soft power, as defined by
Joseph Nye (2004), which is considered to be the power of attraction.
Soft power cannot, strictly speaking, be capable of deterrent effect
because deterrence requires that a potential adversary selects a less
attractive course of action[**.** Whether **diplomacy** either supports
a largely military deterrence or is used instead of military force is
mainly **[determined by a state's foreign policy outlook]{.mark}** and
its strategic culture. **[In liberal systems, diplomacy is used to
deter]{.mark}** unacceptable outcomes using political and economic
pressures. These can involve negotiations where compromises and
inducements may be offered and accepted by both sides. States where
**[realist]{.mark} foreign [policies]{.mark} predominate, tend to [give
prominence to hard power]{.mark} deterrence.**]{.underline} Indeed, [in
some cases these [states may **not want to deter**]{.mark} an adversary
from a threatening stance [because their goals are]{.mark} more readily
**[achieved through military intervention]{.mark} to**]{.underline}, for
example, achieve regime change. States rarely select either a purely
liberal or a strictly realist approach to international relations. The
two approaches invariably exist as a blend, with relative priority of
each approach being affected by factors such as the level and nature of
the threat and the possible deterrence options. This duality of
political philosophy is near universal in international relations, but
is starkest in the West where historic divisions over whether security
can be obtained through power or through principles, have resulted in a
confusion bordering on political schizophrenia. American independence
from Europe in the nineteenth century led to more than a political
separation from Europe. It involved a new philosophical and moral
approach to security because, "America ascribed the frequency of
European wars to the prevalence of governmental institutions which
denied the values of freedom and human dignity" (Kissinger 1994, p. 32).
[European leaders of the time believed that security could come from "a
competition of selfish interests" while [American leadership]{.mark}
[imagined]{.mark} a system "in which **[states]{.mark} would [act
as]{.mark} co-operative [partners]{.mark}**, not as distrustful
rivals" -- thus, the idea of dignity was linked to a new political
outlook through the role of morality in international
affairs:]{.underline} "American leaders rejected the A. Ashraf 47
European idea that the morality of states should be judged by different
criteria than the morality of individuals" (Kissinger 1994, p. 32). Old
European realism progressively gave way to American liberalism as the
USA gained power through its involvement in the two World Wars and
European empires declined because of them. [The emergence of a
[**threat** from a **rival superpower**]{.mark} during the Cold War and
the opportunities for power maximisation afforded by the USA's
subsequent political and military supremacy [has seen a **reversal of
outlooks**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Europe now champions a liberal
international order based on values of human dignity while the waves of
liberal and realist approaches of various US administrations have seen
the tide turn away from liberalism towards realism[**.** It is mainly
[this]{.mark} apparent **[contradiction]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [the
USA's]{.mark} articulation of [liberal international relations and a
realist approach to power]{.mark} that [gives rise to claims of double
standards]{.mark} by other nations. It further [complicates deterrence
strategies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Diplomatic mechanisms like sanctions
are underpinned by international laws based on liberal values. However,
the perception of many in the global community is that Western powers
manage to bypass these when it suits their national interests. [**Many
[non-democratic regimes cite these instances to justify their own
noncompliance]{.mark}** with international norms**, thereby weakening
the moral effect of diplomatic deterrence-based
sanctions.**]{.underline} Elements of realist thinking can exist within
liberal states and in international institutions such as the UN. Sir
Zafrullah Khan, Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the UN in the
1960s, and a passionate defender of the Arab and Palestinian cause,
commented following one of the Arab Israeli wars "What is lost on the
battle field, cannot be recovered in negotiations. The Arabs have lost
their case. Diplomacy can only soften the effects of defeat" (Koreshi
2004, p. 36). The 'wisdom' of this assessment has stood the test of
time, [presumably because once parties step away from peaceful means of
dispute resolution to embark on war, they step into the domain of
realism.]{.underline} This empirical reality may have been a significant
deterrent to wars in the post-colonial era, but the counterfactual
nature of this hypothesis makes any proof difficult. Several useful
conclusions could be drawn from a detailed study of the relationship
between deterrence diplomacy. One may be that when deterrence is being
achieved by a simple, single state action, a realist approach is likely
and where it might require a collective or coalition approach, a
liberalist response involving international institutions may be
employed.

## Deterrence

### 1NC\-\--General

#### Extended deterrence triggers adversarial aggression -- the plan creates the perception of 'encirclement' 

**Hoell et. al. '25 \--** Maximilian Hoell, a postdoctoral research
fellow at the Center for Global Security Research at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory. ("Extended Deterrence in a Multipolar
World," Mar. 25-26, 2025; Center for Global Security Research;

[[Russia and China view U.S. extended]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence as a
critical obstacle]{.mark} to their strategic ambitions,]{.underline}
though their perspectives differ based on their geopolitical priorities.
Although it remains to be seen how the [[Russian approach is
changing]{.underline}]{.mark} in light of the new U.S. administration,
since Russia initiated its war of aggression against Ukraine in 2022,
[[Moscow]{.mark} has [focused on countering]{.mark} what it perceives as
a [war against the collective West]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia
struggles to differentiate between U.S. extended nuclear deterrence to
NATO and U.S. aid to Ukraine. While Russia seeks to undermine U.S. aid
to Ukraine, it has not directly challenged NATO's article 5 by kinetic
means. The reason is the Russian assumption that a regional or
large-scale war with a likelihood of escalation to a nuclear war would
potentially be catastrophic for the Russian leadership and population.
At the same time, there appears to be some reflection about how Russia
fits into the European security architecture. Although one can debate if
these reflections are sincere, they exist and they are tied to the U.S.
effort to pivot to the Indo-Pacific. Russia also appears to view
critically the prospects of a Europe without U.S. extended nuclear
deterrence, particularly one with enhanced nuclear deterrents in Britain
and France and possibly newly emerging nuclear-armed states.
[[China]{.mark}, on the other hand, [views U.S.]{.mark} extended nuclear
[deterrence as part of a broader]{.mark} U.S. [strategy to contain its
rise]{.mark} and rightful place in the global order. [China]{.mark}
never isolates U.S. extended nuclear deterrence in its thinking but
[views it]{.mark} instead [as an inseparable part of a larger
problem;]{.mark} that is, [how do U.S.]{.mark} extended nuclear
deterrence and [alliances work]{.mark} together to roll back China's
rise? From China's perspective, the United States uses allies and
extended nuclear deterrence [as tools to]{.mark} extend and [push back
aggression]{.mark} against China. [Beijing does **not** view]{.mark}
U.S. extended nuclear [deterrence as]{.mark} [something that]{.mark}
deters or **[prevents]{.mark}** something[, but]{.mark} as [an effort to
**win**]{.mark}]{.underline} against China, denying Beijing its rightful
place in the world. Extended nuclear deterrence, then, is a U.S. grand
strategy to prevent the normal course of history for the middle kingdom.
[[Both]{.mark} Russia and China [employ multifaceted approaches to
counter]{.mark} U.S. extended nuclear [deterrence]{.mark}, targeting its
military, political, and alliance dimensions. These [efforts move along
a spectrum]{.mark} of alignment, [ranging from]{.mark} ad-hoc
[**coordination** to]{.mark} deeper collaboration. Russia has innovated
**[disinformation]{.mark}** campaigns, using AI tools [to sow discord
among]{.mark} Western [allies]{.mark}. Russia has further [ramped
up]{.mark} its **[gray zone activities]{.mark}** like cutting undersea
cables, [blurring]{.mark} the [lines]{.mark} between covert sabotage and
overt aggression.]{.underline} The role of Russian nuclear weapons at
the regional level is less clear, though Moscow has several options. The
forward-basing of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus facilitates
signaling and complicates NATO decision-making. [[Additionally,
Russia]{.mark} has [issued **nuclear** threats]{.mark} to limit Western
military aid to Ukraine, [aiming to establish red lines and]{.mark}
[reduce]{.mark} the [effectiveness of extended]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} indirectly]{.underline}

### AT: Deterrence Successful

#### Deterrence [theory is flawed]{.underline}

#### 1. [MICROFOUNDATIONS]{.underline}. Deterrence theory is founded on the [false presumption]{.underline} that decision-makers are [perfectly]{.underline} rational.

Tim **Sweijs &** Mattia **Bertolini 23**, \[Tim Sweijs, The Hague Centre
for Strategic Studies Director of Research; Mattia Bertolini, HCSS
Assistant Analyst, "Dancing in the Dark: The Seven Sins of Deterrence
Assessment",
https://hcss.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dancing-In-The-Dark-7-Sins-Deterrence-HCSS-2023-V2.pdf\]
lzhao

The seventh and last sin of [[deterrence scholarship]{.mark} is the
tendency to **either [ignore or use the wrong microfoundations]{.mark}**
of decision-making.]{.underline} At the very core of the deterrence
logic lies the decision-making calculus of the aggressor that, if
deterrence policies are successful, is dissuaded from attacking on the
basis that "the costs and/or risks of that action \[...\] outweigh its
benefits".65 [Yet, deterrence research often refrains from specifying
these causal [mechanisms that are **traced back to the
decisionmaker**]{.mark}, which is central to deterrence
theory]{.underline}. How exactly is the decisionmaker dissuaded (or not)
from engaging in an attack? What exactly is the decision-making calculus
of the attacker? And at what point and how [do deterrence measures enter
the decision-making calculus of an attacker?]{.underline}

[[Deterrence]{.mark} analysis [tends to ignore]{.mark} these
foundational questions of the deterrence logic [**and fail to address**
the]{.mark} decision-making calculus,]{.underline} which is at the
**[[very core of deterrence theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It sticks to
the system level of analysis and [[treats the various
states]{.underline} **[involved as unitary]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[actors,]{.underline}** ignoring the decision-making processes within
these states by key individuals. For example, recent commentary on
whether or not Western deterrence posture has failed in Ukraine, fails
to address how Western deterrence strategies have affected the
decision-making process of Russian leaders.66 Not only do deterrence
scholars ignore the decision-making calculus, [[oftentimes **wrong
microfoundations are used** to make sense of]{.mark} decision-makers'
[actions]{.mark}, most notably [through the use of rational
models]{.mark} of decision-making.]{.underline}

Jervis, Lebow, and Stein put it well: "[deterrence posits a
psychological relationship, so it is [**strange that most analyses of it
have ignored decision makers' emotions, perceptions, and calculations**
and]{.mark} have [instead relied on]{.mark} deductive [logic based on
**the premise that people are highly rational**]{.mark}.]{.underline}"67
Rational models of deterrence hypothesise that a challenger is more
likely to initiate an attack when the expected costs of armed conflict
are lower.68 This is, admittedly, an attractive explanation of leaders'
decision-making given its rigour and parsimony. [However, the
**[behaviour of decisionmakers]{.mark} often [deviates]{.mark}** from
the core tenets of rational deterrence theories.]{.underline} Jervis
states that deterrence theory "**[[overestimates the rationality]{.mark}
of decisionmakers]{.underline}**, [[especially under **high
stress**]{.underline}]{.mark}."69 [Instead, their decision-making
calculus is [prone to]{.mark} **misperceptions and
[miscalculations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The assumption of rationality [[fails to take]{.underline} [note of
these deviations]{.underline}]{.mark} [that shape leaders' judgement and
choices]{.underline}. Moreover, when assessing deterrence, one asks
whether the threat persuades and whether it is deemed credible by the
adversary. [This line of questioning already departs from the assumption
of rationality.]{.underline}70 Whilst rational deterrence theory may be
simple and elegant, its **[[empirical relevance is
questionable]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Deterrence scholarship should seek
to open the black box of decision-making to shed light on the
[microfoundations of the theory]{.underline}. Scholars should look to
other theories of decision-making in their analysis of deterrence
encounters, including bureaucratic, psychological, and emotional models
of decision-making. Various scholars, most notably Jervis, Lebow, and
Stein, have explored the psychological foundations that persuade or
dissuade a challenger from attacking.71

#### 2. [AMBIGUITY]{.underline}. Aggressive deterrence incites a [violent]{.underline} 'who started it first' paradox.

Tim **Sweijs &** Mattia **Bertolini 23**, \[Tim Sweijs, The Hague Centre
for Strategic Studies Director of Research; Mattia Bertolini, HCSS
Assistant Analyst, "Dancing in the Dark: The Seven Sins of Deterrence

lzhao

The third sin involves the [inherent bias in the designation of defender
and challenger in a deterrence encounter: [**who is deterring whom is in
the** eye of the beholder]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even though the defender
and challenger are conceptually different, it is sometimes hard to
distinguish them in reality. The interchangeability of defender and
challenger leads to a fundamental problem: [[**one's own deterrence
policies can be seen as** aggressive, calling for
countermeasures]{.mark} by an opponent,]{.underline} and, thus,
[[defeating the **initial purpose of
deterrence**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Whilst defender and challenger are easy to distinguish theoretically, it
is **[[not]{.mark} always [easy to differentiate]{.mark} a defender and
challenger from an empirical perspective.]{.underline}** Both actors
want to deter the other, both through threats and actions. [The party
that "[started it first"]{.underline}]{.mark} [can arguably be
identified as the challenger, since it [is **challenging the
status-quo**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} However, [**"[who started it
first"]{.underline}** [is always]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the eye of the
beholder as the status-quo is a **[subjective]{.mark}
one.**]{.underline}

For example, [many analyses of deterrence encounters during the Cold War
designate China and the Soviet Union as the challengers.]{.underline}
However, this **[[disregards the possibility]{.mark} that]{.underline}**
from their side the Chinese and Soviets might have been motivated by
defensive considerations. Such judgments are politically sensitive and
even deterrence analysts whose goal is to offer dispassionate, fact
based descriptions of deterrence encounters, [tread carefully over what
are hotly contested issues.]{.underline}35

More recently, [Sino-US competition in the Taiwan Strait sees [both
sides **accusing one another of challenging the
status-quo**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and being the **[aggressor that has
to be deterred]{.underline}**.]{.mark}36 The difficulty to distinguish
defender and challenger is not just a potential complication for the
measurement of deterrence itself but poses a fundamental strategic
problem because it may lead to misguided deterrence policies. These,
rather than being [defensive in nature aimed at **[deterring an
attack]{.mark} from an opponent**, [can be interpreted as
**offensive**]{.mark} **in nature [and trigger]{.mark} [unintended
escalation]{.mark}** in deterrence]{.underline} encounters as both
parties regard the other as the challenger.

#### 3. USE IT OR LOSE IT.

\*possible rehighlight on how increasing defensive capabilities is good
-- but you should answer by stressing that does not deter escalation and
only "gives a better chance" in case of conflict

Studies. ("Reconsidering Deterrence for Space and Cyberspace," Sept.

[[Deterrence is **no longer**]{.mark} a **[sufficient]{.mark}** goal
[for strategy]{.mark}. To paraphrase Sir Michael Howard, there is
widespread [doubt that]{.mark} a posture of [deterrence, however
structured, will be enough to prevent]{.mark} an opponent that accepts
[war]{.mark} as an instrument of policy and has built up a formidable
arsenal from not only initiating but fighting through a conflict in the
expectation of victory, whether the United States wishes it or
not.]{.underline}19 If the question is whether the United States can
apply concepts of deterrence developed for nuclear weapons to deter
attacks on networks or space assets, the answer is no. [In peacetime,
[opponents]{.mark} will [avoid]{.mark} destructive [attacks that]{.mark}
would [justify]{.mark} the use of force by the United States in
retaliation. [During]{.mark} armed [conflict]{.mark}, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will not be able to deter]{.mark} or
prevent [attacks given]{.mark} different [perceptions of]{.mark} risk by
attackers that derive from the perception of **[asymmetric
vulnerability]{.mark}**. [Opponents]{.mark} will [stand to gain more
than]{.mark} they expect to [lose]{.mark} in any exchange. Deterrence is
no longer a sufficient goal for strategy.]{.underline} 78 Future
conflict will certainly include cyberattacks and possibly attacks on
satellites. The goal of American strategy should be to deny these
attacks success in achieving their larger objective of gaining military
advantage over US forces by disruption of cyber and space assets. The
best way to accomplish this objective is to create the ability to fight
and win even if attacked in the space and cyber domains. Planning and
acquisitions must be based on the assumption that opponents will attack
space and cyber assets and that the United States must retain the
ability to deliver the services these assets provide and limit any
degradation in overall performance. A second objective for strategy is
to shape and constrain the use of cyberattack to influence opponent
calculations during conflict. The development of agreed international
norms could define constraints and escalatory thresholds and shape
wartime use of cyberattacks by making it easier for opponents to
calculate risk. Broad international acceptance of norms could lead
opponents to choose targets or modes of attack that hold less political
risk. Multilateral understandings on acceptable behavior would increase
the political risk of an attack and might justify retaliation. Just as
the use -- and even the threat of use -- of nuclear weapons has been
stigmatized,20 stigmatizing certain space and cyberattacks, or attacks
against certain classes of targets, could reduce the risk of these
attacks being launched. Stigmatization might be harder to create, as
cyberattacks do not produce the moral repugnance that the planned use of
nuclear weapons created, and the United States might, in the case of
cyberattack, wish to preserve freedom of action to use these techniques.
[The absence of a visible cyber or space "arms race," where nations
publicize the development of new capabilities in order to change
opponent [calculations of]{.mark} the benefits of [military action,
suggest]{.mark}s that in practical terms, [deterrence]{.mark} now
**[plays a subsidiary]{.mark}** and supporting [**role**, confined
to]{.mark} a few specialized and [unlikely kinds of
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nuclear weapons are no longer the focus
of warfare. They exist, serve some symbolic function and perhaps cancel
out their use by adversaries. Perhaps as a result, new forms of conflict
have gained prominence in [which [classic concepts of]{.mark}
[deterrence have little value]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taking Brodie's
point on the utility of military force, the intent of building strategic
arms was to deter. [Now, [adversaries build weapons **designed to foil
deterrence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The arms race was a kind of implicit
bargaining between opponents, where one side's deployments or programs
led to a countering effort to preserve stability. Maintaining The goal
of American strategy should be to create the ability to fight and win
even if attacked in the space and cyber domains. 79 a rough parity drove
investment and planning. Now, countries build cyber and space weapons
for warfighting advantage. Improving defensive capabilities,
constructing a normative framework that creates political disincentives
for satellite and cyberattacks, and building in operational robustness
that limits the benefit an attacker could gain, would all change
opponent calculations in ways favorable to the United States. None of
these steps entail repeating the Cold War experience of building
offensive capabilities whose threatened use would deter attack. This
essay questions whether the strategies and concepts developed for
nuclear deterrence can be usefully applied to other kinds of conflict.
Nuclear weapons are uniquely destructive, and the bipolar global
conflict was a unique political moment in international affairs. In this
context, deterrence made sense, but these conditions do not exist for
space or cyberspace. [[Deterrence]{.mark},]{.underline} like Alfred
Thayer Mahan's decisive battle between fleets of battleships, [may be
[an artifact of st]{.mark}rategy from an earlier era that political and
technological change [has overtaken]{.mark} and made instructive, [but
not actionable]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## AI Deterrence

#### AI deterrence causes miscalculation and Unmanned systems can't send credible signals to adversaries\-\--that [turns]{.underline} strategic stability.

Alternatively, allies might see [[U.S. reliance on unmanned
systems]{.mark} as an unwillingness]{.underline} to put American lives
on the line during confrontations with adversaries. This
[[could]{.underline} [reduce the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited
[S]{.mark}tates' [ability to assure its
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Widespread [AI]{.mark} and
autonomous systems [could lead to]{.mark} inadvertent [escalation and
crisis instability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Decisions made at machine
rather than human speeds [also have the potential to **escalate crises
at machine speeds.**]{.underline} During protracted crises and
conflicts, there could be strong incentives for each side to use
autonomous capabilities early and extensively to gain military
advantage. [[This raises the possibility of **first-strike**]{.mark}
instability.]{.underline}

[[AI]{.mark} and autonomous [systems also have the potential to **reduce
strategic stability**]{.mark}]{.underline} between adversaries and make
the use of force more likely as they lower the risks to military
personnel. An arms race in autonomous systems between the United States
and China already appears imminent and is likely to increase
instability[. [A **proliferation of autonomous systems** could]{.mark}
also ignite a serious search for countermeasures]{.underline} and
[[exacerbate uncertainties]{.underline}]{.mark} that leave countries
perceiving themselves as less secure, in a textbook example of the
security dilemma. Different mixes of human and artificial agents [could
affect the escalatory dynamics between two sides.]{.underline} In our
wargame, [[U.S. and Japanese forces went down a path of
using]{.underline}]{.mark} [largely [**unmanned systems with human**
control]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas [[Chinese forces
included]{.underline} **[manned systems]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[**controlled by machines**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [This created a
dynamic in which U.S. and Japanese forces tried several times to
deescalate the crisis because of their reluctance to kill Chinese
personnel,]{.underline} whereas the player for the [[Chinese
forces]{.underline} **[did not]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[appear to [feel
the need to deescalate]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} From this, we
hypothesize a larger dynamic whereby different configurations of humans
and machines---in terms of both physical presence and
decisionmaking---may affect escalatory dynamics.

First, we hypothesize that when physical presence and decisionmaking are
both primarily human, there is a lower escalatory dynamic (due to
slower, human decisionmaking) but a higher cost to miscalculation
(because human lives are at stake). Second, we postulate that when the
physical presence is primarily machine and decisionmaking is primarily
human, as U.S. forces were in our wargame, there is both a lower
escalatory dynamic and a lower cost of miscalculation (because human
lives are not at stake). For the third case, where physical presence is
primarily human, as U.S. forces were in our wargame, there is both a
lower escalatory dynamic and a lower cost of miscalculation (because
human lives are not at stake). For the third case, where physical
presence is primarily human but the decisionmaking is primarily machine,
as were Chinese forces in the wargame, we hypothesize a higher
escalatory dynamic (due to machine decisionmaking) and a higher cost of
miscalculation. Lastly, we hypothesize that when both the physical
presence and the decisionmaking are primarily machine, there is a higher
escalatory dynamic but a lower cost of miscalculation (because human
lives are not at stake). When adversaries have different configurations,
the onus may be more on one to deescalate.

[[Machines will]{.mark} likely [be **worse at understanding**]{.mark}
**the [human signaling involved in deterrence]{.mark}**[, especially
**deescalation**. ]{.mark}]{.underline}[AI]{.mark} that is programmed to
aggressively exploit tactical and operational advantages [**[could
misunderstand]{.mark}** adversary [attempts to signal resolve]{.mark}
but avoid signaling imminent attack, to avoid further
escalation]{.underline}, to or actively deescalate a situation. Whereas
traditional deterrence has largely been about humans attempting to
understand other humans, deterrence in this new age involves
understanding [along a number of **additional** pathways]{.underline}.
Not only must humans understand adversary humans, they must adequately
understand their own machines and adversary machines. Machines must also
accurately understand their own humans, adversary humans, and adversary
machines.

[[These additional pathways introduce possibilities for]{.underline}
**[misinterpretation, misperception, and
miscalculation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Continual modernization over time
means that countries will likely always have a mix of new and legacy
systems, potentially making it difficult to understand the full set of
human machine interactions within any military. Past cases of
inadvertent engagement of friendly or civilian targets by autonomous
systems may offer insights [about the technical accidents or failures
involving more-advanced systems.]{.underline} Military autonomous
systems are not new, and neither is inadvertent engagement by such
autonomous systems as landmines, torpedoes, the Phalanx antimissile
system, and the Aegis weapon system. Human or system target
misidentification was one common problem in many of these historical
cases. It is possible that AI could improve target identification and
reduce this type of error. [It is also possible that [human **error
interacting with even more-complex**]{.mark} **[systems could contribute
to future inadvertent engagement.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

## Space Deterrence

### 1NC

#### Space deterrence capabilities bad -- escalates to a Sino-American Cold War, extinction.

The [[US dependency on space will grow as Chinese]{.mark} military
[space capabilities grow.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[As a consequence, the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is obliged
to reinforce]{.mark} space [deterrence capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}
while engaging in diplomatic initiatives aimed at reassurance . This
combination of initiatives proved successful during the Cold War, and
can continue to be successful in the future. The [key elements of space
deterrence,]{.underline} as with nuclear deterrence, [are secure
retaliatory capabilities sufficient to deny advantages to an attacker,
effective command and control mechanisms, and redundant safety and
security mechanisms to prevent accidental as well as unauthorized use of
military capabilities. In addition, [successful]{.mark} successful
[deterrence requires **situational awareness**]{.mark}**, attribution
capabilities**, as well as resilient space assets]{.underline} 37
deterrence requires situational awareness, attribution capabilities, as
well as resilient space assets so that the United States is able to
identify the perpetrator of harmful actions and continue to utilize
space for national and economic security despite these acts. These
requirements are not controversial, although they may not be affordable
in sufficient measure -- as was the case with the perceived requirements
of nuclear deterrence. The crux of debate over space deterrence is
whether to continue to rely very heavily on latent or residual
capabilities to engage in warfare, if necessary, or to shift toward more
evident, dedicated, kinetic and deployed means of dissuasion. There are
several powerful arguments for the United States to continue to rely on
inferred rather than heavily [[demonstrable deterrence]{.mark} in space.
To begin with, a non-dedicated, nondeployed, non-kinetic space
deterrence posture has been successful in the past. An inferred posture
is also more conducive to stabilizing deterrence than the deployment and
testing of dedicated, kinetic counter-space capabilities. These
hallmarks of an [intensified arms competition]{.mark} did not produce a
great sense of security in the nuclear domain, [and are **unlikely** to
offer a greater sense of security in space. Instead]{.mark}, more
demonstrable space [deterrence efforts]{.mark} are likely to
[increase]{.mark} requirements and [costs **while decreasing
assurance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [An [accelerated competition]{.mark}
in the development, testing and deployment of US and Chinese
counter-space capabilities [is likely to **spill over into the nuclear
domain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The practical effect of this linkage
would be to increase nuclear requirements in China, while retarding
reductions in deployed US nuclear capabilities that are in excess of the
Pentagon's needs. In a constrained budget environment, the United States
could apply defense dollars more wisely and enjoy added security if this
dynamic could be avoided. Another reason to avoid an intensified
competition in dedicated and deployed counter-space capabilities is that
residual and latent [US counter-space capabilities are [growing]{.mark}
significantly, particularly with respect to [new missile defense]{.mark}
interceptors. The growth in inferred capability provides the basis to
avoid a competition in dedicated, deployed counter-space capabilities --
if China is amenable to inferential deterrence.]{.underline} This [[is
an essential qualifier]{.mark}. A continued US preference [to]{.mark}
avoid a [heightened competition]{.mark} marked by repeated displays of
dedicated capability to disrupt, damage or destroy space assets depends
on Beijing's acceptance of inferred deterrence.]{.underline} The United
States and China have both demonstrated counter-space capabilities. If
Beijing decides to ramp up its space warfare capabilities, the Pentagon
will not be found wanting in this competition. A far more [[preferable
posture would be]{.underline}]{.mark} one of "contingent 38
[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}," whereby the Pentagon does not
exercise options well within its capabilities, as long as the PLA is
similarly constrained. Parallel policies of contingent restraint worked
during most, but not all, intervals of the Cold War.28 This dynamic can
also succeed under far less demanding contemporary circumstances.
Deterrence is based on threats. [[Deterrence,]{.mark} by itself[, is not
reassuring]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Cold War did not become hot because
deterrence was complemented by reassurance in the form of diplomatic
accords to reduce nuclear dangers. Contingent restraint can be
inferential, or it can be reinforced by diplomatic accords. Stable
deterrence requires reassurance when competitors possess devastating
military options.29

[[Space weapons and missile \"defence\"]{.mark}]{.underline} While as
far as anyone knows there are currently no weapons deployed in space,
the United States has invested in developing potential technologies, and
[both China and the United States [have demonstrated anti-satellite
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In
response to the potential threats of space weaponization, as well as
perceived ballistic missile threats, the [US is also developing a
ballistic missile defense shield. While missile [defense]{.mark} is
[presented as]{.mark} a [defense]{.mark} of American and allied
territories [against a]{.mark} limited missile [attack]{.mark}, it [is
in reality one]{.mark} more [step towards full]{.mark} spectrum
[dominance]{.mark}. Missile [defence allows countries to develop
offensive technologies under the pretence of defense.]{.mark} For
example, [Kinetic]{.mark} Energy [Inteceptors]{.mark} are missiles that
are launched into space to take out enemy missiles by smashing into
them. They also [have potential applications as offensive]{.mark}
anti-satellite [weapons]{.mark}, because the same maneovering abilities
and set of controls is necessary to destroy satellites.]{.underline}
Major defense contractors are actively developing their aerospace
capabilities, and smaller aerospace corporations are competing to prove
their technical innovation in making satellites smaller and launch
vehicles less expensive. There are many reasons to be concerned about
the [[development of]{.mark} missile defence and [space]{.mark} weapon
[tech]{.mark}nology, including the [increased]{.mark} conventional
[military dominance]{.mark} by the United States, the vast waste of
resources that accompanies any arms build-up, whether it\'s a race or an
asymmetrical surge, and the physical results of [fighting in]{.mark}
outer [space]{.mark} - especially space debris, which will [destroy
civil and commercial]{.mark} space [infrastructure]{.mark} such as
satellites.]{.underline} The corporations studied in Reaching Critical
Will\'s Dirty Dozen and the Dirty Dozen Annex are all contributing to
the steady drive toward a future in which these concerns are our dirty
reality. Space debris Besides creating an new arms race, the
[[weaponization of space means proliferation of space debris]{.mark}.
Such [debris]{.mark}, resulting from 50 years of space activity,
[already poses a]{.mark} considerable [hazard]{.mark} to
spacecraft.]{.underline} This crowding problem could worsen as a large
number of space weapons could be deployed in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The
launching and testing of weapons would also increase space debris.
Moreover, [[deploying]{.mark} space-based [weapons in the]{.mark}
increasingly crowded realm of [LEO would leave less room for civilian
systems]{.mark}. Those problems would also occur during periods of
peace. [If a number of satellites were to be destroyed]{.mark} during
the course of a war, some [scientists warn]{.mark}, they would create so
much debris [that it would prevent future satellites from being
stationed]{.mark} in space and generally limit space
access.]{.underline} Effects on arms control and nuclear disarmament The
[[weaponization of space will destroy strategic]{.mark} balance and
[stability,]{.mark} undermine international and national security, [and
disrupt existing]{.mark} [arms control instruments]{.mark}, [in
particular those related to nuclear weapons and missiles]{.mark}. These
[effects]{.mark} will inevitably [lead to a new arms
race]{.mark}.]{.underline} Space weaponization would seriously disrupt
the arms control and disarmament process. The United States\' withdrawal
from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2001 and the development of US
ground- and sea- based "[[missile defenses" have already increased
tensions with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and have led to increased
missile proliferation.The [[deployment of]{.underline}]{.mark} these
technologies or the development of [[space-based techn]{.mark}ologies
will [likely]{.mark} [cause]{.mark} Russia, as well as the United States
(in response to Russia), to make smaller and [smaller reductions of
their nuclear arsenals and]{.mark} to [reject]{.mark} the development of
[new treaties to regulate]{.mark} nuclear weapons and their delivery
systems. China would likely build more warheads to maintain its nuclear
deterrent, which could in turn encourage India and then Pakistan to
follow sui]{.underline}t. [In January 2007, China tested an
anti-satellite weapon against one of its own ageing weather satellites.
The United States, while condemning the test, forged ahead with several
space and missile defence projects with dual-use capabilities. In
addition, in February 2008, the United States shot down own of it\'s own
failed satellites that was carrying a half-ton of hydrazine rocket fuel
(a toxic chemical). The US military shot it down with a Standard

Military and security

The rapid rise of [[Chinese military]{.mark} strength]{.underline} has
[forced]{.underline} a **[rethink of security]{.underline}** issues in
the Asia-Pacific region. Although Chinese military spending as a share
of GDP has been stable for decades, the **[speed of
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the economy has [[allowed China
to]{.mark} build a formidable [challenge]{.mark} to [U.S.]{.mark}
military [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. China's more [assertive military
posture]{.underline} in the region has [frightened]{.underline} U.S.
military [planners]{.underline} and unnerved China's neighbors. Even as
the U.S. maintains a far larger and more powerful military presence
around the world and annually spends about three times as much as China
on its military, [the gap in military power has **fallen
rapidly**]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific region. 

[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [has a
**[crucial]{.mark} role** to play [in]{.mark}]{.underline} preserving
[stability]{.underline} and security in the region. At the same time,
[U.S.--China [tension]{.mark} is [setting in motion]{.mark}]{.underline}
a highly [**destabilizing [security dilemma]{.mark}**,]{.underline} in
which [[each side takes]{.mark} measures it considers
[defens]{.mark}ive]{.underline} but that [the [other side **perceives as
threatening**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If allowed to continue, [the
[outcome]{.mark} will]{.underline} be **[[spiraling]{.mark} military
escalation]{.underline}**, a regional [[arms race]{.underline}]{.mark},
increasing [militarism]{.underline} and nationalism in all countries, a
loss of resources for social needs on all sides,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[a **catastrophic military
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [first priority]{.underline} should be [reducing military
tensions]{.underline} in the region. The U.S. and China are currently
engaged in [tit-for-tat provocations]{.underline} around Taiwan and in
the South China Sea that [**reduce security for everyone** and raise the
[risk of]{.mark}]{.underline} an accident or
[[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}ulation exploding into serious conflict.

This [constant friction helps nationalists]{.underline} in both
countries while further eroding previous understandings that secured the
peace. One of the only material gains from the reopening of U.S.--China
diplomatic exchanges over the last year has been progress in reducing
the rhetorical temperature and discussions on safety protocols and
confidence-building measures, but much remains to be done on these
counts.

Particularly fruitful would be [[open]{.mark}ing **[arms control]{.mark}
talks** with China.]{.underline} Last February, China --- breaking from
its previous refusal to discuss limiting nuclear weapons because its own
arsenal is dwarfed by those of the U.S. and Russia --- proposed
negotiations among all nuclear powers on a shared no-first-use treaty.

Biden, who broke his campaign pledge that his administration would
codify a strictly defensive nuclear policy,has not responded.

Second, we should [reject]{.underline} calls from [the
**m**]{.underline}ilitary-**[i]{.underline}**ndustrial
**[c]{.underline}**omplex [and]{.underline} the foreign policy
establishment [to **dramatically expand** the U.S.
military]{.underline}. Rather than huge new outlays on weapons, military
[[planners should]{.mark} be [rethink]{.mark}ing U.S. **[force
posture]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific [to better deter
China]{.underline}. The impulse to maintain [[absolute
access]{.underline}]{.mark} for the U.S. military over waters and
airspace near China [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} both needlessly
[**[threatening]{.mark} and resource-intensive**. Instead, the [U.S.
should]{.mark} support]{.underline} regional [allies]{.underline} to
build up their [own]{.underline} coastal and air [defenses
while]{.underline} switching to a lighter footprint for the U.S.
presence: [[reduc]{.mark}ing the size of **[forward
deployments]{.mark}**]{.underline}, dispersing existing forces, and
developing a strategy aimed at denying China control over the space in
the event of conflict.

Even as the U.S. takes these prudent measures with its partners,
however, it should repudiate the current push that they take sides
against China, which antagonizes leaders in third countries afraid of
being caught between the two powers while confirming Chinese fears of
encirclement[. Current U.S. policy]{.underline} one-sidedly
[emphasizes]{.underline} measures aimed at **[[intimidating
China]{.mark} into restraint]{.underline}**, with almost no positive
initiatives that would make peace an appealing prospect. Far from
stabilizing the situation, [such]{.underline} an imbalance [exacerbates
elite resentment]{.underline} and popular nationalism [in
China]{.underline} and [[risks convincing]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[military]{.mark} action [is
their only choice]{.mark}]{.underline}** to secure core interests.

An [[effective]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[balance of power]{.mark}
requires]{.underline} far greater [emphasis on]{.underline} nonmilitary
opportunities to strengthen **[relations]{.underline}** with both third
countries and China itself, with a particular focus on nonexclusionary
initiatives. The economic side of a positive program is addressed above
--- and its [success is [possible only through]{.mark} U.S.--China
[cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The security agenda should build on
existing ASEAN frameworks and revive bilateral U.S.--China diplomacy
that Trump abandoned and Biden only nominally restored. Such measures
are not meant to solve the underlying source of tensions, but to buy
time for the structural reforms to the global economy and longer term
security initiatives that could.

China's response to U.S. extended nuclear deterrence falls into three
categories. In the economic/political/diplomatic category, [[China seeks
to]{.mark} **[undermine]{.mark}** U.S. [**alliances** whenever it
can]{.mark}.]{.underline} By going after alliances, it seeks to
undermine U.S. extended nuclear deterrence. As President Xi noted in
2014, China seeks an "Asia for Asians." From this perspective, Beijing
should not engage in crisis management because if the United States were
not in the region in the first place, there would be no crises to
manage. Instead, China likes to speak of crisis prevention. [[At
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2024 Preparatory Committee for the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty ([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}) in Geneva, the
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} Arms Control and Disarmament Association
hosted a side event on nuclear sharing, claiming that U.S. extended
nuclear deterrence was a dangerous undertaking contradicting the NPT and
that the United States was pushing for nuclear sharing in Indo-Pacific.
China, by contrast, sought a no-first use policy. Beijing further
[[criticizes]{.mark} U.S. [extended]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence as
**preventing** nonproliferation]{.mark} and nuclear-weapon free zones.
[China has also taken actions]{.mark} against specific decisions to
counter the strengthening of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence [through
**economic** coercion]{.mark} (e.g., [sanctioning]{.mark} South
[Korea]{.mark} because of THAAD; using trade as a weapon against
Australia; [or leveraging Belt and Road investments to prevent]{.mark}
deeper [cooperation]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and the Philippines]{.mark}). On the whole, U.S.
[allies have resisted]{.mark} these attacks. The second category entails
[military]{.mark} [responses]{.mark}, particularly [in the gray
zone]{.mark} where thresholds of aggression are less clear. China
[employs]{.mark} gray zone tactics, such as deploying coast guard and
fishing [vessels to harass]{.mark} U.S. allies [and]{.mark} conducting
[cyber campaigns]{.mark} against Taiwan. Military [exercises]{.mark}
simulating an invasion of Taiwan are timed strategically to
psychologically [condition the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its
allies]{.mark}. Additionally, [China's]{.mark} ongoing nuclear and
conventional [military buildup aims to]{.mark} enable quick territorial
seizures, [creati]{.mark}ng [**fait accompli scenarios** that make U.S.
intervention more costly]{.mark}]{.underline} and difficult. While
China's military buildup predates this strategy, it now views
territorial grabs as a viable way to make it more difficult for the
United States to fight back. The final category is the Alliance
category. China is careful not to respond alone to U.S. extended nuclear
deterrence. At the same time, [[China]{.mark}]{.underline} avoids fully
[[align]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[itself with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} but h[[as increased **coordination** in
economic and military spheres]{.mark}. China also promotes
[alternative]{.mark} governance [regimes like]{.mark} the [BRICS]{.mark}
and renewed its friendship treaty with North Korea in 2020,
[signal]{.mark}ing its broader [efforts to counter U.S.
influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are more similarities than
differences between Russia and China's approaches to countering U.S.
extended nuclear deterrence, which can only be concerning for the West.
Both countries view U.S. extended nuclear deterrence as part of a larger
U.S. strategy to maintain dominance; both seek to reshape regional
security architectures to diminish U.S. influence; both view quick
territorial grabs as a viable strategy to make it difficult for the
United States to restore the status quo ante; and both believe they have
the upper hand, that geography is in their favor. Finally, both [[Russia
and China]{.mark} have hitherto largely avoided direct kinetic
confrontation with the United States, preferring gray zone tactics for
the most part. In terms of differences, China [see]{.mark}s U.S.
[extended]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence as an]{.mark} [**encirclement**
problem]{.mark} (that is, an effort to prevent its rise), whereas
[Russia sees it more as an **existential** problem]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moscow prefers political subversion and disinformation, whereas China
emphasizes economic coercion. Historically, Chinese nuclear weapons
played a limited role in responding to U.S. extended nuclear deterrence
but that might be changing with its nuclear buildup. Finally, Russia's
strategic focus has historically been on Europe, while China's has been
on the Indo-Pacific -- though this is changing in light of
Chinese-Russian rapprochement. To respond, the United States and its
allies should be guided by the question of whether they have adapted
fast enough, at the speed of relevance, to Russian and Chinese
challenges. This implies a leadership focus on coordinated pushback in
diplomacy, developing new partnerships, expanding our thinking on
counter-challenges (e.g., "a whole-of-society" response is necessary but
insufficiently systematic); developing concepts and capabilities to
operate in theater fast, under a nuclear shadow, and in a nuclear
environment. Finally, the United States must consider more seriously the
implications of a China-Russia rapprochement and opportunistic
aggression, including by initiating a cross-regional dialogue between
U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific.

## Assurances Bad

### 1NC

#### Strengthening Alliances [cause war]{.underline}:

#### 1. [FREE-RIDING]{.underline}. Confident [underspending]{.underline} causes [unnecessary risk]{.underline} of war.

Pathologies of the hub-and-spoke model

[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
currently [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} more than 50 treaty allies spread
across seven defense pacts, as well as [dozens of]{.underline} other
"[[strategic partners]{.underline}]{.mark}."44 Most of these alliances
have been in effect for about seven decades, despite dramatic changes to
the United States' security environment. Today we see evidence that [the
U.S. alliance [system]{.mark} is [experiencing]{.mark}]{.underline} many
of the **[[drawbacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** to alliances explained in
previous sections. That might be acceptable if our alliances were needed
to counter a major threat. However, many of our alliances have been
inherited from prior eras and circumstances, not intentionally crafted
to counter threats in the present.

[The [first problem]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States'
alliances [is **[free-riding]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Free-riding is
often framed in terms of dollar costs, but the more pressing issue is
that it [results in [military unpreparedness on]{.mark} the [part
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and thus
undermines deterrence. The United States has a number of w[ealthy
allies]{.underline} that [**[under-spend on]{.mark} their
[defense]{.mark}**[, despite]{.mark}]{.underline} often
[facing]{.underline} more [[threatening
environments]{.underline}]{.mark} than the United States. In particular,
[Japan and Germany]{.underline}, the third and fourth largest economies
in the world, have consistently [spent]{.underline} around [**1 percent
of their GDPs on defense**, despite]{.underline} their respective
[proximity to China and Russia]{.underline}.45 This problem extends to
partners and quasi-allies, like Taiwan, which, despite being in
potentially great danger, has been conspicuously casual about its own
defense, likely [[because of]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[confidence in
**U.S. protection**]{.underline}]{.mark}.46

#### 2. [RECKLESS DRIVING]{.underline}. U.S. commitment emboldens [allied aggression]{.underline}.

Christopher **Mccallion '24** \[(Christopher Mccallion is a Fellow at
Defense Priorities) "Grand strategy: Alliances," Defense Priorities,
https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/grand-strategy-alliances/,
9-17-2024\]

A [second]{.underline} problem [is **[reckless driving]{.mark}**,
where]{.underline}by [[allies take risky policy]{.underline}]{.mark}
chances [[they would]{.mark} be]{.underline} too [[cautious]{.mark}
to]{.underline} attempt [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} the backing of
**[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.
In addition to being underprepared, the United States' [allies are
[encouraged by]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. security [[guarantees to be
**less**]{.underline}]{.mark} cost- and
**[[risk-averse]{.underline}]{.mark}** than they would be if they were
primarily responsible for their own security. [This
[distorts]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[decision-making and]{.mark} can
[lead to **provocative behavior**]{.mark}]{.underline} vis-à-vis rivals.
Japan's assertive stance on the
**[[Senkaku]{.underline}]{.mark}**/Diaoyu [islands]{.underline} and its
provocative dismissal of its neighbors' grievances from World War II are
one example.50 The problem extends beyond the United States' treaty
allies to its "strategic partners" as well. [[Ukraine
targeting]{.underline}]{.mark} early warning [radar stations **inside
Russia**, [Israeli **attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} on Rafah, Lebanon,
and Syria, [[and Taiwan's claims to]{.underline}]{.mark} "de facto
**[[independence]{.underline}]{.mark}**" from China are all examples.51

#### 3. [OVEREXTENSION]{.underline}. Alliance guarantees causes [commitment traps]{.underline}---that [weakens deterrence]{.underline} and forces U.S. [draw-in]{.underline}.

Christopher **Mccallion '24** \[(Christopher Mccallion is a Fellow at
Defense Priorities) "Grand strategy: Alliances," Defense Priorities,
https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/grand-strategy-alliances/,
9-17-2024\]

A [third]{.underline} major problem [is
**[overextension]{.mark}**]{.underline} of capabilities and commitments.
While U.S. [[policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} have historically been
paranoid about credibility---arguably fighting unnecessary wars just to
prove their willingness to fight over anything---they nonetheless [are
[eager to provide guarantees]{.mark} to states]{.underline} whose
security [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[**[has no]{.mark} vital [interest in]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} which
[they **cannot**]{.mark}]{.underline} confidently
**[[defend]{.underline}]{.mark}**.52

During the unipolar moment, the United States took on a number of
dependents to whose defense it could not be plausibly committed,
particularly the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The
dubious credibility of U.S. expanded commitments after the Cold War was
in large part compensated for by its overwhelming preponderance of
capabilities. [With the [resurgence of Russia]{.mark},]{.underline}
however, [the [prospect that]{.mark}]{.underline} deterrence might fail
and these [[commitments]{.underline}]{.mark} may **[[have to be
honored]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [[**increased**, underlining]{.mark}
their [non-credible]{.mark}]{.underline} and therefore risky
[[nature]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. commitment to use [nuclear
[weapons to defend]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Baltics]{.mark}
is]{.underline}, on the one hand, **[[implausible]{.mark}
enough]{.underline}** from the perspective of the security of the United
States and the core economies of Europe [[that]{.underline} [Russia
might]{.underline}]{.mark} choose to **[[call the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
United States' **[[bluff]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the other hand, if
Russia were to call the United States' bluff and attack the
Baltics---which would be difficult for NATO to defend
conventionally---[the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [may, in turn]{.underline}, become more
likely to [[escalate]{.mark} to]{.underline} the use of [nuclear weapons
[if]{.mark}]{.underline} it feels a failure to successfully defend [the
[Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} its
more **[important [commitments elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}**.53

Credible [deterrence rests on]{.underline} a combination of [capability
and resolve]{.underline}. It is inherently more credible that a state
will defend itself rather than another state. The United States'
"**[[hub-and-spoke]{.underline}]{.mark}**" alliance
**[[structure]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [at the center]{.underline} and its allies
maintained as dependents---[[results in]{.mark} a perverse scenario
where]{.underline}by the [[states]{.mark} with]{.underline} the most
**[[interest in defending]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves
**[[neglect]{.mark} their [capability]{.mark}]{.underline}** to do so,
[[while]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[state with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
most [[capability]{.mark} [has]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[less]{.underline}]{.mark}** obvious **[[interest in]{.mark}
taking]{.underline}** on the **[risks of]{.underline}** a great power
[[**war**. This undermines deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} in these
regions [by [placing]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[responsibility
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the shoulders of **[a distant [an]{.mark}d
[overstretched U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, rather than more proximate and
resolute states with considerable latent power potential.

Failed?" (Mar 26, 2025)
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/03/after-18-years-has-the-quad-failed.html>
///newsciabo

[When [Japan]{.mark}ese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe [introduced]{.mark}
the idea of a [**Quadrilateral** Security Dialogue]{.mark} (QSD)
[to]{.mark} the heads of state of [Australia, India]{.mark}, and the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates at a side meeting of the ASEAN Regional
Forum Summit in May [2007]{.mark}, his vision was [to forge a
**coalition of democracies to [counterbalance
China](https://www.delhipolicygroup.org/uploads_dpg/publication_file/harnessing-the-quads-maritime-power-5277.pdf)**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[]{.mark}[(PDF)]{.underline}](https://www.delhipolicygroup.org/uploads_dpg/publication_file/harnessing-the-quads-maritime-power-5277.pdf)
[in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} Eighteen years later, it\'s not clear
that the initiative has been a success. [The objectives of Abe\'s
[proposal covered [national security and
diplomacy](https://chellaney.net/2007/06/01/the-u-s-india-japan-australia-quadrilateral-initiative/)]{.mark},
ranging "from promotion of democracy and collaboration on homeland
security to [joint]{.mark} disaster-[response operations]{.mark} and
building greater [military interoperability.]{.mark}"]{.underline} It
initially received support from India and the United States, which were
strengthening ties through a nuclear fuel agreement and viewed the QSD
as a means for India to forge closer relationships with U.S. allies.
Australia was, however, hesitant, being concerned about the addition of
a country, India, that it saw as a weaker partner, to an ongoing robust
trilateral security dialogue between Australia, Japan, and the United
States. The timing turned out to be poor. Abe resigned as prime minister
of Japan in September 2007. [By that time, [China]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
several [ASEAN nations]{.mark} had [expressed concerns]{.mark} that the
QSD aimed to establish an exclusive security framework in their
region.]{.underline} Australia, under newly elected Prime Minister Kevin
Rudd, prioritized deepening trade relations with China. Meanwhile, the
United States entered the Great Recession and sought economic
cooperation with Beijing. India, wary of antagonizing China and
competing with ASEAN, remained cautious. When Australia withdrew from
the next QSD meeting in February 2008, the initiative seemed doomed,
with Japan left as its sole advocate. [Revived [in]{.mark} November
[2017]{.mark} by the United States, the [Quad]{.mark} by then [had more
willing partners.]{.mark}]{.underline} India had faced a military
standoff with China in Doklam that summer, and Australia was grappling
with Chinese [influence
operations](https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/rise-fall-rebirth-quad/).
Largely to accommodate India\'s continued concerns about antagonizing
China, however, the group renamed itself as the Quad. [It distanced
itself from overt security objectives, instead [emphasizing]{.mark}
support for a "[rules-based order]{.mark}" and humanitarian efforts. The
vision was to forge a coalition of democracies to counterbalance China
in the Indo-Pacific. [**Eighteen years later,** it\'s **not** clear that
the initiative has been **a success**. ]{.mark}]{.underline} To clarify
that support for a rules-based order did not involve military action,
the Quad declared that all its activities would be planned with ASEAN\'s
three goals in mind: "support for ASEAN centrality, ASEAN-led regional
architecture, and ASEAN\'s adoption of its [Indo-Pacific Outlook
(PDF)](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ASEAN-Outlook-on-the-Indo-Pacific_FINAL_22062019.pdf)."
The latter contained a key condition: It called for dialogue and
cooperation rather than rivalry. An important aspect of the Quad that
should not be ignored is how public its posture has always been
regarding its proposed activities. This would not have been necessary
had the objective been just to discuss the China threat[. Instead, the
[public posture]{.mark} seems to be a way of [undertaking public
diplomacy in the target countries]{.mark}. By doing so, it committed the
[Quad]{.mark} to being [accountable]{.mark} to the public of the target
countries [in the provision of the public goods
promised.]{.mark}]{.underline} How well has the Quad fulfilled its role
as a public goods provider? The list of proposed public goods
initiatives of the Quad has been vast in scope. Starting with
humanitarian disaster aid, a second area, pandemic support, was added in
2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic began. With each subsequent Quad
meeting, the list was further expanded. The Quad\'s mission commits it
to delivering resources for education fellowships, cancer research, the
development of ports, coast guard training, tracking maritime activity
in the South China Sea, solar cell production, regional connectivity
infrastructure (digital and physical), AI in agriculture, research and
development in critical and emerging technologies, cybersecurity,
climate management, and semiconductor supply chain reliability---all of
which are designed to "support the Indo-Pacific." [Despite this
ambitious agenda, financial [**commitments** have been
**modest**.]{.mark} Aside from COVID-19 vaccine aid, total funding for
these initiatives has **amounted to less than \$50
million.**]{.underline} Why has the Quad struggled to deliver meaningful
public goods?

Some major obstacles stand out. First, the nature of public goods
delivery in the region limits what an external grouping like the Quad
can effectively provide. Public goods differ in their geographical
impact and require matching resolutions---cross-border pollution, for
example, is best handled bilaterally or through trusted regional
institutions like ASEAN, which has a strong track record in resolving
bilateral issues. Similarly, global public goods, such as climate change
mitigation, require adherence to international agreements rather than
separate Quad-led efforts.

However, the Quad could add value in areas that are regional public
goods, particularly where ASEAN lacks adequate capacity, such as
pandemic response, STEM education, maritime security, disaster relief,
and regional connectivity. [Yet [progress]{.mark} in these areas has
been [**slow,** highlighting **further obstacles.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
One is ASEAN\'s concerns about activities that could have more than
their stated purposes. [**[Maritime security efforts]{.mark}**, for
example, have **[stalled]{.mark}** due to ASEAN nations\' [fears]{.mark}
that the]{.underline} [[[Quad\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} [real
objective]{.underline}](https://pacforum.org/publications/pacnet-48-a-work-in-progress-the-indo-pacific-partnership-for-maritime-domain-awareness/)

[[East Asia presents]{.mark} a]{.underline} somewhat [greater

security [[guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark}. Japan's
[[confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the U.S. commitment
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark} the fact
that the United States has some **[[54,000 troops]{.mark} stationed
there]{.underline}** as a tripwire against an attack.65

If [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
maintains its Asian alliances to hedge against the potential threat of a
rising China, it [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [make clear
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} that [it is
[only]{.mark} willing to act as [a **backstop, not**]{.mark} **as [a
vanguard]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [surest way]{.underline} for the
United States to convey this message [would be to [remove
its]{.mark}]{.underline} forward-deployed **[[troops from East
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and adopt a maritime strategy, [acting as an
"[offshore balance]{.mark}r.]{.underline}"66 This would not only
[[incentivize regional]{.mark} actors to **take**]{.underline} principal
**[[responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** for their own defense, but
would [encourage them [to develop]{.mark}]{.underline} security
[[ties]{.mark} independent of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, **[[making]{.mark} regional [deterrence more
credible]{.mark}]{.underline}** and durable than if it remained
dependent on U.S. guarantees backed by the threat of nuclear use.

U.S. [retrenchment may incentivize Japan]{.underline}, Germany, and/[or
South Korea]{.underline} to seek a **[nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**
of their own. While [[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} carry the
low-probability and high-consequence risk of nuclear war, they also
[greatly [reduce]{.mark}]{.underline}---even if they do not
eliminate---**[the [risk of]{.mark} conventional great [power
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**67 [Conventional wars]{.underline} between
great powers were both a recurrent and increasingly costly phenomenon
prior to the invention of nuclear weapons, but one has [not occurred
in]{.underline} the subsequent [eight decades]{.underline} that mark the
nuclear age. [[Nuclear weapons discourage]{.underline} [conventional
war]{.underline}]{.mark} between nuclear powers **[[by
raising]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [**[costs]{.mark}**, compelling
caution]{.underline} in the face of uncertainty in order to avoid
cataclysmic miscalculation.

The [[threat by]{.underline}]{.mark} a state like
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} or Germany [to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in order to prevent an existential threat to its
survival **[[is]{.mark} infinitely [more
credible]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and therefore produces greater
stability---[[than]{.mark} the [current arrangement]{.mark}]{.underline}
of extended deterrence. There is [no]{.underline} compelling reason to
think this would cause a [cascade]{.underline} of regional
proliferation, [as these states']{.underline} most likely
**[adversaries]{.underline}**---China, Russia, and North Korea---[**are
all already nuclear-armed states**, as are]{.underline} a number of
their [local]{.underline} [allies]{.underline} or partners. The threat
that nuclear weapons may be acquired by malevolent non-state actors who
cannot be deterred is another risk that must be considered, but this is
more a question of stability, management, control, and cooperation among
nuclear-armed states than one of preventing any and all proliferation
among states.68

[DOWNSIZING]{.underline} U.S. FOREIGN [COMMITMENTS]{.underline}

The United States' alliance [commitments are insolvent]{.underline} in
part because [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[has]{.underline}** committed its
**[[overstretched]{.underline}]{.mark}** resources either to defend
states with the latent capacity to defend themselves or less capable
states in whose security it only has a peripheral interest. The United
States maintains these commitments [out of]{.underline} a
[fear]{.underline} that extricating itself will produce catastrophic
instability. Allies take advantage of this fear by pleading helplessness
while deliberately neglecting their own defense.

NATO-Europe vs. Russia

[[NATO-Europe has]{.mark} **more than [enough]{.mark}** latent
[power]{.mark}]{.underline} to balance Russia and defend itself without
U.S. assistance.

But when assessing the international scene, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [has little
reason to be]{.underline} so [paralyzed]{.underline} that it can't
prudently adapt to new circumstances. The United States [[should
adopt]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[buck-passing]{.mark}
strategy]{.underline}** that [[incentivizes local]{.mark} powers to
[balance]{.mark}]{.underline} against threats as they emerge. The United
States should [act only as]{.underline} the "**[balancer of last
resort]{.underline}**" if it deems it necessary to thwart a potential
Eurasian hegemon. [This [means shifting the]{.mark}]{.underline} main
[[burden]{.underline}]{.mark} of defense over [[to allies]{.mark} and
partners]{.underline}, rather than sharing the burden with them.62

NATO's European nations have more than enough aggregate latent power
potential to balance against Russia without the U.S. presence on the
continent.63 The [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}an Union [[has a]{.mark}
collective [GDP **on par with the U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and China]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
European [[governments are]{.mark} institutionally
[sound]{.mark}]{.underline} and have been [[socialized by]{.mark}
decades of [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} and fraternity.
[[If]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates were to gradually but [steadily [remove
its troops]{.mark}]{.underline} and turn over control of NATO to
European commanders, there is little doubt [the
[Europe]{.mark}ans]{.underline} would be **[[compelled to take]{.mark}
their own [defense]{.mark}]{.underline}** more
**[[seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States [[could
maintain]{.mark} a]{.underline} separate and [[limited agreement
on]{.underline}]{.mark} security [[coop]{.mark}eration with]{.underline}
the **[major states]{.underline}** of Western Europe and states in the
actual North Atlantic. But if it is true, as the Europeans say, that the
Baltics, the Balkans, and Ukraine are vital to their security, then it
is well past time for them to take on the burden of their defense,
rather than the United States shouldering that burden.

liberal, model of governance **gaining popularity**]{.underline} \[62\].
For the US, [Taiwan joining China would represent **defeat** on **both
indicators**.]{.underline} Taiwan's staying outside China's rule make
one of the US' highest stakes \[14, 93, 102\] The situation may appear
to be a classic security dilemma in alliance politics \[125\], with the
US trapped too deeply in Taiwan's quest for independence. Still, it is
not typical because two security dilemmas exist simultaneously
between 1) the US and China and 2) Taiwan and China.

[[Taiwan has **not declared independence officially**]{.mark}, although
[hav]{.mark}ing all [other attributes of]{.mark} **independent
[statehood]{.mark}** than diplomatic recognition.]{.underline} Taiwan
has launched anti-Chinese campaigns to the effect that most voters
support independence \[127, 146\]. [[Given China's]{.mark}
**demonstrated** [determination to **deter**]{.mark} Taiwan's
[independence]{.mark}, [Taiwan has not taken]{.mark} the [**final step**
of declaring independence.]{.mark}]{.underline} Between Taiwan and
China, [[the **understanding**]{.mark} used to be for [both]{.mark} to
[**refrain** from **forcing** a solution.]{.mark} Note that China's
**anxiety** is registered in **Taiwan's independence** instead of the
**US dominance** in the world, as [Taiwan's independence]{.mark} would
**[destroy]{.mark}** China's **[regime legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[112\]. [However, [if the US]{.mark} could [ensure]{.mark} its
**absolute [superiority]{.mark}** [over China]{.mark},
**[Taiwan]{.mark}** would [have **no reason** to stay with]{.mark} the
**[existing understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[113\]. Accordingly,
the [[US dominance has **direct implications** for China]{.mark}'s vital
interests.]{.underline}

#### It\'s an [ontological threat]{.underline}. Taiwan unification is a [part]{.underline} of Chinese National Identity so a formal independence declaration is [existential]{.underline}. Realism [can't]{.underline} explain this.

Ontological Threat and Security

According to Laing \[50, 77\], [[an ontological threat is an
**existential threat**,]{.mark} more [a threat to **self**]{.mark} than
to the body]{.underline} \[72, 73, 95, 148\]. Specifically, in this
paper, [[it refers to being **denied**]{.mark} of a relation that
constitutes [what]{.mark} **one believes [one
is]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} According to this definition,
ontological security in international relations cannot be denied to a
national actor directly \[1\]. [The threat is only real when the
relation of belonging that constitutes a nation's being faces
**denial**, which is a particularly **acute point** in the separatist
movement]{.underline} \[47\]. [[A separatist makes no]{.mark}
necessarily [**physical threat** but]{.mark} inevitably [an
**ontological** threat]{.mark}]{.underline} because she cannot be
categorized by belonging to an already agreed relation \[30, 60\].
Separatism easily obliges third parties' intervention when ethnic,
religious, and ideological identities are in jeopardy, regardless of the
lack of a physical threat. [[In]{.mark} the case of [Taiwan, keeping it
from]{.mark} the **pressure of [unification]{.mark}** [is critical to
the credit of]{.mark} the world order---i.e., **[American
leadership]{.mark}**, rather than the homeland security of the
US.]{.underline}

To the extent that ontological security is primarily relational,
scholars simultaneously locate it internationally and internally \[19,
76, 96, 100, 126\]. Together, [[it is what the]{.mark} **domestic
[constituency]{.mark}** collectively [believes about what the nation is
**entitled**]{.mark} in the world. [Denying]{.mark} the relations
[composes an **ontological threat** and a **powerful
motivation**]{.mark} in itself [for]{.mark} all parties subscribing to
the relations to **take [action]{.mark}s**]{.underline}, not necessarily
contingent upon the balance of power calculus \[121, 143\]. [This means
that deterrence **must be mutual**]{.underline} \[34\]. [A **weak
power** can sometimes **challenge** a **strong power**, and the
**latter** can **compromise**.]{.underline} Both protect a specific
relation that constitutes the national identities of the disputing
parties \[59\]. The force of ontological security is registered in the
domestic determination to protect an international relational order
threatened by anti-/revisionism \[9\].

[Scholars note that [ontological security is]{.mark} necessarily
**discursive** and **interpretive**]{.underline} \[16, 39, 49, 56, 91,
137\], and [[**expressed** through]{.mark} narratives on [**values** and
**history**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Being intrinsic to the regimes' and
the leaders' legitimacy, the notions of natural rights and democracy are
components of ontological security for liberal democratic countries,
including the US. In contrast, [**national [unification]{.mark}** [is
the ontological issue **paramount** in]{.mark} the [Chinese discursive
environment.]{.mark} Instead of being the major indicator of the
ontological security condition, the **military capability** can
**support** or revise, but **not determine**, an **ontological
relation**.]{.underline} Such an ontological relation is prior and
continuous \[6, 10\]. It simultaneously defines the national identities
of actors subscribing to the same prior relation \[73\]. [Preparing for
**war** can be an **ontological threat** for war could **disrupt**
long-established **peaceful coexistence**. Therefore, China's
**preparation** for **armed unification** disrupts four decades of all
around **exchanges** with Taiwan. However, the literature notes that
stabilizing peace that assumes mutual recognition can likewise be an
ontological threat]{.underline} \[41, 52, 75, 95, 122\], for peace could
disrupt a long-established rival relationship. Accordingly, signing a
long-term peace pact with China could jeopardize Taiwan's pursuit of an
un-Chinese identity.

### AT: Deterrence Solves

#### U.S. efforts at deterrence [fail]{.underline}---it only [emboldens]{.underline} China to [push harder]{.underline} in order to [deter]{.underline} calls for independence.

[In sum, **[deterrence]{.mark}** to incur fear [**must be
relational**.]{.mark} It either **rings no bell** or **backfires
otherwise**. [US]{.mark} military [capability does not deter
China]{.mark} [from entering a spiral because China wants to **deter
Taiwan**]{.mark}**'s [independence]{.mark}** instead of the US threat to
China. [China does not respond to US]{.mark} [military]{.mark}
activities **[elsewhere]{.mark}** as much]{.underline}. Even on the
[[S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea[,]{.mark} the [Chinese
response has been]{.mark} strictly [**requesting** to **steer
away**]{.mark} after verifying and **identifying** the passing US
warships [rather than **escalating**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[85\].
Likewise, in terms of ontological security, [the US **increasingly
understands** China's anti-Taiwan independence in the double relations
of the neoliberal order and **hegemonic stability** as China becomes the
**second** strongest military power in the world.]{.underline} Taiwan's
ontological security concerns complicate/simplify the mismatched
security dilemma between the US and China. [They **nullify** the US'
deterrence because Taiwan turns this into their own relational
deterrence to China, which constitutes an ontological issue for
China.]{.underline} The Taiwan-China pair composes an ontological
security dilemma. Their mutual threat reinforces China's one-China
stance and Taiwan's belonging to (non-Chinese) superior modernity.
Finally, [an [**implicit security dilemma** exists between the US and
Taiwan.]{.mark} The inflexibility of Taiwan's **ontological position**
incentivizes the US to transfer the security dilemma to a vicarious
dilemma between China and Taiwan. Still, [the US **risks
entrapment**]{.mark} in the ontological security dilemma between Taiwan
and China.]{.underline}

[[The **solution**]{.mark}, for the practitioners to consider, [is for
**none** of the]{.mark} three [parties to **push**]{.mark} on [their own
ontological security **to the extreme**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Therefore,
to reduce the ontological security dilemma would take, [[as an **initial
step**, the reduction of US']{.mark} military [support to
Taiwan]{.mark}, which would [automatically]{.mark}
**[de-escalate]{.mark}** the [passion for]{.mark} immediate
[independence in Taiwan]{.mark}, [China's]{.mark} **ontological
[need]{.mark}** [to react]{.mark} **militarily**, [and]{.mark} the [US'
**anxiety** regarding]{.mark} an [ontological **challenge**]{.mark}
across the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} This proposed solution is exactly
the [**opposite** of the concept of the **classic security dilemma**,
which would recommend **no backing down** on military support for
Taiwan.]{.underline} However, as already discussed, such a line of
argument would fall prey to the ontological security dilemma.

### AT: Won't Declare Independence.

[Taiwan [Qing]{.mark} Dynasty [**conceded** Taiwan to Japan]{.mark} in
1895.]{.underline} Under Japanese colonialism, [[Taiwan
**acquired**]{.mark} a [**civilizational identity** of]{.mark} belonging
to [Japan]{.mark} and **[surpassing China]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[25,
86\]. [[Japan returned Taiwan to China]{.mark} at the end of WWII.
[Taiwan]{.mark} became the **rare postcolonial society**
[ruled]{.mark}]{.underline} not by the formerly colonized population but
[by a **migrant** Chinese regime, which arrived [with]{.mark} the
**[expectation]{.mark}** of Taiwan [to **re-Sinicize**.]{.mark} [Ruled
by a]{.mark} presumably [**inferior** government]{.mark} claiming
**superiority**]{.underline} \[8, 33\], the [**deprived** postcolonial
[population]{.mark} simultaneously [**suffered silencing** by
the]{.mark} continuous **Chinese [Civil War]{.mark}** [and the **Cold
War**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[63\]. When both receded, [the postcolonial
population [**transcends** Chinese consciousness by retrieving colonial
**modernity consciousness**]{.mark} \[64, 133\], [which **fits**
the]{.mark} American **[neoliberal order]{.mark}** well. [Colonial
modernity **informs**]{.mark} contemporary [Taiwan's]{.mark}
[ontological security.]{.mark} It reverses **colonial inferiority** and
distinguishes Taiwan from China.]{.underline} Such a consciousness
[**contributes** to the indifference to the **territories** and
**waters** that the Chinese migrant regime used to claim]{.underline}
but failed the US or the Japanese consent \[57, 61\]. [[Having felt
**increasingly intimate**]{.mark} [with **superior** Americans and
Japanese, the postcolonial population can **regain**
self-respect]{.mark} \[32\].]{.underline}

[[Taiwan's **separatist** sensibilities indicate **revisionism** to
China]{.mark}, whereas China's appeal to **unification** poses
**revisionism** to Taiwan]{.underline} and the US, and Japan \[21,
128\]. [[Taiwan]{.mark} thus [holds]{.mark} the [**strongest relational
deterrence** against unification]{.mark}, [i.e.]{.mark}, the
[**readiness** to declare **official independence**.]{.mark} Derived
from Taiwan's relational deterrence, the second-ordered relational
deterrence is in the **US' hands**]{.underline}, i.e., the
[[determination to protect Taiwan from]{.mark} **China's
[unification]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Taiwan also [[faces]{.mark} China's
**relational deterrence**, i.e., the [plausibility of **armed**
unification]{.mark}, which **nullifies** Taiwan's colonial **modernity**
and the US' neoliberal order.]{.underline} A double ontological security
dilemma---the US vs. China and China vs. Taiwan---constitutes Taiwan.

[[To **investigate** how **changes** in]{.mark} U.S. [**security
policy** influence Taiwanese attitudes toward **independence**]{.mark},
we [conducted]{.mark} a [**difference-in-difference
estimation**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In both scenarios, we set U.S.
strategic ambiguity as a reference point. First, given China's military
coercion scenario (Scenario 1), [[U.S. **strategic clarity**
increases]{.mark} the public's [**support** for **independence** by 0.23
points]{.mark} relative to strategic ambiguity as shown in Fig. 4. This
[result achieves]{.mark} **conventional [statistical
significance]{.mark}**]{.underline} (p=.082, 90% CI \[0.12, 0.44\]).
However, [U.S. strategic **abandonment**, unsurprisingly, **lowers
support** by 0.29 points compared to the **baseline**. This result is
**also statistically significant**]{.underline} (p=.016, 90% CI \[−0.49,
−0.09\]). This evidence aligns with our expectations. In the absence of
direct military conflict, [[Taiwanese citizens are **more likely** to
**support independence** when Washington pledges]{.mark} to **come [to
Taiwan's defense]{.mark}** and less likely when Washington declares that
it will not intervene in any military contingencies.]{.underline}

## LIO

### 1NC

#### The LIO entrenches colonialism and imperialism 

**Parmar '18** \[Inderjeet Parmar, professor of international politics,
and head of the Department of International Politics at City, University
of London, The US-led liberal order: imperialism by another
name?, International Affairs, Volume 94, Issue 1, January 2018,
https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iix240\] evchkra

The overall finding is that liberal internationalist thinking/theory is,
in effect (albeit unconsciously on the part of its proponents), a
legitimating ideology rather than an effective explanatory frame for
understanding the way in which the LIO actually works. That conclusion
is reached, in part, by suggesting the applicability of a rather
different perspective on the operations of the LIO and US power:
specifically, a synthesized Gramscian--Kautskyian framework, explained
below. The key point is that [[the **LIO i**s]{.mark} a class-based,
[elitist hegemony]{.mark}---[strongly **imbued with**]{.mark} explicit
and implicit **[racial and colonial]{.mark}**/imperial
**[assumptions]{.mark}**---in [both]{.mark} US [domestic and
foreign]{.mark} relation]{.underline}s. At home, [[this analysis]{.mark}
helps to [explain]{.mark} in part the phenomenon of the ['left behind'
white working]{.mark}/middle [class]{.mark}, including the affluent but
economically anxious voters whose salience on the right has transformed
US politics since the Reagan revolution]{.underline} of the 1980s.2
Responding to the (minorities') rights revolution of the 1960s, and the
loss of economic opportunity and decline in living standards due to
technological change and the global redistribution of industry,[3 white
working- and middle-class [voters drifted towards]{.mark} the
[Republicans]{.mark} as the party of low taxes and fiscal
conservatism.]{.underline}4 This delivered little in material terms,
however; and[, [as inequality increased]{.mark} with market freedom and
real wages stagnated, [workers]{.mark} in the 'rust belt' and other
areas [grew]{.mark} increasingly [dissatisfied]{.mark} with the status
quo of establishment politics, [their frustration exacerbated by
anxieties about]{.mark} ethno-racial [diversity]{.mark} and American
identity as the United States moves towards a society in which whites
are a minority.5 [The result was]{.mark} the election as president in
2016 of Donald Trump on [an overtly anti-conservative]{.mark} and barely
concealed [white identity]{.mark} platform at home and a programme of
protectionism and non-interventionism---America
First---abroad]{.underline}.6 Yet political dissatisfaction or
disaffection was not confined to the political right.7 'Occupy Wall
Street' and other movements and groups vented their anger at the
inequalities of power, wealth and income, particularly in the wake of
the Iraq War and the 2008 financial crisis.8 In external policy, the
analysis helps to explain the difficulty, perhaps the impossibility, of
the US readily embracing a more diverse international order, as well as
the character of that very embrace.9 [[Accepting nations of]{.mark} [the
global South]{.mark} on an equal footing may [become a]{.mark} strategic
[necessity]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} the process remains [problematic given
the racialized discourses of western power]{.mark} over the past several
centuries]{.underline}, fortified in the United States by the experience
of the slave trade, slavery, the 'Jim Crow' era, Orientalist views of
Asians, and other factors.10 Class power helps to explain the strategic
embrace of foreign elites as the sources of change and the agents of
American influence, however diluted it may have been due to target
states' national interest considerations. Those at the apex of America's
hierarchies sought to forge alliances with and incorporate their foreign
elite counterparts--- with their full cooperation---in South Korea and
China.11 Hence, the liberal internationalist 'successes' in the cases of
South Korea and China must be qualified by considering the repercussions
of developing market-oriented societies marked by economic inequality,
rising social unrest and varying degrees of political repression. In
'successful' China and South Korea, as in India and other emerging
powers, [[there remain major challenges underpinned by]{.mark} profound
[inequalities in power]{.mark}, [wealth]{.mark} and income, [associated
with]{.mark} a [politics]{.mark} that is frequently class-based but
[also heavily racialized and xenophobic]{.mark}.]{.underline}12 Why
choose South Korea and China as key cases? Although these are two very
different states, varying in global significance, and analysed at
different periods of historical time, they do allow us to test out
important claims made by liberal internationalists. South Korea is
considered as a key test at the very birth of the US-led order---at a
time when we might expect the new principles embodied in the UN, such as
the rule of law, the lessons of the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes
trials, the Geneva Conventions and the rights of civilians in combat
zones, to be pursued with some determination if not fully achieved.
Given the fervour of anti-colonialism at the time, and US claims to
champion that cause, we might also expect the behaviour of the
international system's leading power to differ sharply from that of
colonial rulers in what became known as the Third World. The case of
South Korea tells us a great deal about the practical application of a
new international system developed by US power within an international
system of rules, applicable to hegemon and others alike, a key liberal
internationalist claim. China's integration into the US-led
international system from the late 1970s also tells us a great deal
about the character of the international order, especially about how
significant change is managed within it and what the embrace of
diversity means in practical terms.

[Nevertheless, [liberal internationalists]{.mark} are
cosmopolitans---opposed to narrow nationalism and trade protectionism,
within a US-led international system.]{.underline} But its core
ideas---rule of law, superiority of the western idea (however lightly
worn), a [[rules-]{.mark}based institutional order open to all, in
principle---[are deeply embedded in US]{.mark}
[political]{.mark}-intellectual [elite think-tanks]{.mark}, university
public policy schools, [corporate media]{.mark} and the [leaderships of
both main]{.mark} political [parties]{.mark},]{.underline}17 the core of
the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant establishment.18 Importantly, however,
there are influential voices in the emerging powers and regions that
support the liberal international order by calling for internal reform
to take account of the changing distribution of global power away from
the West and towards the 'rest'.19 The upshot is a broad consensus
around certain core ideas: that the post-1945 rules-based world order,
whatever its weaknesses, serves the world well by spreading prosperity
and maintaining peace; and that, although it cannot continue unreformed,
[[the]{.mark} US-led [system draws on]{.mark} deep
resources---[economic, military]{.mark}, [systemic]{.mark} and
'[soft']{.mark}---[that]{.mark} bestow upon it [continu]{.mark}ing
[strengths to]{.mark} [contain]{.mark}, engage, [manage]{.mark} and
[socialize emerging powers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Charles Kupchan lists a
range of problems requiring US leadership, even if only within a
suitably reformed international system reflecting 'the real distribution
of power'.20 John Ikenberry of Princeton University, the leading
proponent of this school of thought, makes significant claims as well as
several unquestioned assumptions, undeveloped allusions to core powers'
violent and other connections with the periphery, and a number of
significant silences. [He claims, for example, that [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates is a fully functioning democracy, yet [fails to
acknowledge]{.mark} evidence of [the power of racialized, class-based
elites]{.mark}]{.underline}. For critical theorists, such as Robert Cox,
Stephen Gill and Craig Murphy,21 the international relations of elites
across states and societies operate to reproduce extant patterns of
power and manage or engineer change to the benefit of elites in a
generally zero-sum game in which broad masses and lower classes lose
out. This is clearly a far cry from liberal internationalist claims
associated with the benefits of globalization, notwithstanding proposed
ameliorative remedies against the harshest effects[. Likewise, claims
about the centrality of the rule of law occlude consideration of
significant violations in practice. The question of imperial power is
hardly addressed, and there is a general Eurocentric neglect of the
significance of global areas beyond the core to the 'welfare' and
cohesion of the core itself.]{.underline} There is a clear link between
Ikenberry's overt theory of American democracy and its liberal-hegemonic
world role. [The United States, and the western order it built, is
characterized as a pluralistic liberal market democracy that is broadly
inclusive and tolerant of ethnic diversity. [The US-built
security]{.mark} community [exhibits its leading state's]{.mark}
internal [character]{.mark} as a plural one and, very significantly, one
in which the United States [is bound by rules]{.mark}]{.underline}.22
Yet liberal internationalists' underlying assumptions effectively deny
the findings of numerous well-researched studies challenging American
democracy's principal claims.23 [As far as Ikenberry and Deudney (and
[many]{.mark} others) [are concerned, the 'western idea' is a
significant part of]{.mark} the strength of [the]{.mark} [US-led
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}24 The West, a spectacularly successful
'civilizational heritage', was underpinned by America's New Deal
liberalism, and extended globally via Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan
and NATO. In effect, this vision and programme aimed to defuse domestic
class conflict and the threat of war through 'activist government,
political democracy, and international alliance'. That system is in
principle capable of assimilating emerging powers, given the
universalism of its values and its tolerance of ethnic differences,
although others joining this privileged grouping are expected to conform
to its rules and accept US leadership. [[Western order is
exclusive]{.mark} also [because special rules apply within its]{.mark}
[zone of peace]{.mark}. Beyond it, conversely, [other rules
apply]{.mark}---[cruder, neo-imperial and violent]{.mark}, although the
implications of this contrast are left unaddressed]{.underline}.25 By
drawing a line around the West, Ikenberry cuts off the rest of the world
while addressing questions about the sources of world order which,
empirically, lie in a symbiotic relationship between core and periphery.
[[Yet]{.mark}, even [within the 'greater']{.mark} [West]{.mark},
[Japan]{.mark} and [South Korea]{.mark} were [not accorded the same
treatment]{.mark} as western Europe.26 [The LIO]{.mark} really
[was]{.mark} conceived and [developed as a system of the West]{.mark}
and the rest, [in a zero-sum game]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Donald Tusk,
President of the European Council, noted on Twitter in May 2017, the
whole point of 'Euro-Atlanticism' was to 'prevent post-West world
order'.27

[the]{.mark} post--Cold War [liberal international order]{.mark} was
doomed to collapse, because [**the [key policies]{.mark}** on which it
rested [are deeply **flawed**]{.mark}. Spreading liberal democracy
around the globe, which is of paramount importance for building such an
order, not only is extremely difficult, but **[often poisons]{.mark}
[relations ]{.mark}**[with]{.mark} other [countries]{.mark} and
sometimes [leads to]{.mark} disastrous [wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Nationalism within the target state is the main obstacle to the
promotion of democracy, but balance of power politics also function as
an important blocking force. Furthermore, [[the]{.mark} liberal [order's
tendency to privilege international]{.mark} [institutions over
domestic]{.mark} considerations, as well as its deep commitment to
porous, if not open borders, [has]{.mark} had [toxic political effects
inside]{.mark} the leading [liberal states]{.mark}
themselves]{.underline}, including the U.S. unipole. Those policies
clash with nationalism over key issues such as sovereignty and national
identity. [Because [nationalism]{.mark} is the most powerful political
ideology on the planet, it [invariably trumps]{.mark} [liberalism
when]{.mark}ever [the two clash]{.mark}, thus [undermining the
order]{.mark} at its core]{.underline}. In addition,
[[hyperglobalization,]{.mark} which sought to minimize barriers to
global trade and investment, [resulted in lost]{.mark} [jobs, declining
wages,]{.mark} and [rising income inequality]{.mark} throughout the
liberal world.]{.underline} It also [made the]{.mark} international
[financial system less sta]{.mark}ble, leading to **[recurring financial
crises]{.mark}**. [Those]{.mark} troubles then morphed into political
problems, further [erod]{.mark}ing [support for the liberal
order]{.mark}. A hyperglobalized economy undermines the order in yet
another way: it helps countries other than the unipole grow more
powerful, which can undermine unipolarity and bring the liberal order to
an end. This is what is happening with the rise of China, which, along
with the revival of Russian power, has brought the unipolar era to a
close. The emerging multipolar world will consist of a realist-based
international order, which will play an important role in managing the
world economy, dealing with arms control, and handling problems of the
global commons such as climate change. In addition to this new
international order, the United States and China will lead bounded
orders that will compete with each other in both the economic and
military realms.2 The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
First, I explain what the term "order" means and why orders are an
important feature of international politics. Second, I describe the
different kinds of orders and the circumstances under which a liberal
international order will emerge. Relatedly, I examine in the third
section what accounts for the rise and decline of international orders.
In the fourth section, I describe the different Cold War orders. In the
next three sections, I recount the history of the liberal international
order. Then, in the subsequent four sections, I explain why it failed.
In the penultimate section, I discuss what the new order will look like
under multipolarity. The conclusion provides a brief summary of my
argument and some policy recommendations.

countries\--[are not seeking to destroy

to expand their influence in long-existing multinational institutions

#### Trump kills LIO -- Clinging to the order crowds ensures reckless US action and makes multilateralism impossible.

**Lazcano, 25** - Martinez Lazcano, Alfonso Jaime, FROM MONARCHICAL
ABSOLUTISM TO UNILATERAL HEGEMONY: \"I AM THE STATE\" TO THE CLAIM OF
\"I AM THE UN\" IN THE 21ST CENTURY (June 25, 2025). Available at
SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5320549 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5320549
/SHCP Haf9000/

[In contrast to this trajectory, the 21st century has witnessed the
emergence of political actors who, with challenging and often sarcastic
rhetoric, advocate a unilateralist vision that could be summarized in
the expression \"The UN is me.\"]{.underline} This phrase, far from
representing an evolution toward shared sovereignty or global citizen
participation, [denotes [an intention to subvert]{.mark} the
[multilateral order, to concentrate global authority]{.mark} in a single
figure or nation, and to [delegitimize]{.mark} the institutions of
[collective governance]{.mark}.]{.underline} This analysis delves into
this distortion of sovereignty, examining its implications and most
pernicious manifestations. II. THE DECONSTRUCTION OF \"I AM THE UN\": AN
ACT OF CHALLENGE TO GLOBAL GOVERNANCE The expression \"I am the UN,\" in
the context of contemporary leaders with nationalist and unilateralist
leanings, should not be interpreted as a manifestation of individual
empowerment or popular sovereignty at the global level. [On the
contrary, it represents a performative act of direct defiance of the
principles of multilateralism and the legitimacy of international
institutions.]{.underline} This stance is characterized by: a) [[Disdain
for multilateral institutions:]{.mark} There is a profound distrust and
disdain for the norms, procedures, and consensus collectively developed
within organizations such as the UN. [Multilateral action]{.mark} is
[perceived as a restriction on national autonomy]{.mark} or the will of
a leader. b) [Hegemonic centralization of global
power]{.mark}:]{.underline} Like the absolutist monarch, the leader who
adopts this stance seeks to project his authority and national interests
as the only relevant ones on the international stage, minimizing or
ignoring the diversity of interests and the need for compromise among
sovereign states. [[Global decisionmaking is perceived as a unilateral
prerogative.]{.mark}]{.underline} c) Appropriation of moral and
political authority: An attempt is being made to replace the collective
authority and moral legitimacy of an international organization with
that of an individual or a nation. This undermines the UN\'s role as a
forum for debate, negotiation, and peaceful conflict resolution,
relegating it to a secondary or irrelevant role. d) Exacerbated
nationalism and unilateralism: This rhetoric is framed within a
nationalist ideology that prioritizes self-interest in an exclusive
manner, often under slogans such as \"my country first,\" justifying
unilateral actions that contravene international treaties or agreements.
III. CONTRADICTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES: THE HYPOCRISY OF POWER IN THE 21ST
CENTURY The \"UN is me\" stance is exacerbated by a series of
contradictions and acts of hypocrisy that undermine the credibility of
the actors and the international system itself. It is at this point that
observations about the European Union and humanitarian crises take on
particular scientific relevance: 3.1. The paradox of peace and war
profit The criticism of the \"subordination\" of entities like the
European Union (EU) to a logic that, under the guise of a \"fool\'s
errand,\" promotes arms sales while aspiring to moral legitimacy ( e.g.
, the Nobel Peace Prize), reveals a fundamental ethical dichotomy. This
contradiction exposes a cognitive dissonance in the foreign policy of
influential actors: a) Peace as rhetoric vs. peace as practice: There is
a discrepancy between the narrative of promoting peace and international
security and the economic practices that support a robust arms industry.
The EU, despite its origins as a peace project, is a significant player
in the global arms trade, which creates an intrinsic conflict with its
aspirations for ethical leadership and its recognition with the Nobel
Peace Prize. b) interests over ethical principles: The implicit or
explicit promotion of arms sales suggests that economic and geopolitical
interests prevail over the principles of peaceful conflict resolution
and violence reduction. This dilutes the credibility of any actor
presenting itself as a defender of peace. 3.2. Selective blindness,
contradiction and the instrumentalization of human rights [The
observation of the \"blindness\" to tragedies and the i[nconsistency in
foreign policy of figures like Donald Trump]{.mark} underscores a
serious [deficiency]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the international response and
the [application of human rights]{.mark} principles:]{.underline} a)
Violation of due process and family human rights: The separation of
families, in the context of strict immigration policies, represents a
flagrant violation of the right to family unity and due process of law[.
The [justification]{.mark} of these actions under national security or
immigration control criteria often [ignores]{.mark} obligations under
[i]{.mark}nternational human rights [law]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
indifference or lack of strong condemnation by global actors who
proclaim themselves defenders of human rights reveals a selective
application of these principles. b) Indifference to the humanitarian
catastrophe in Gaza: The inaction or insufficient response to the
magnitude of the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza, including the massive
loss of civilian life, forced displacement, and the destruction of
essential infrastructure, evidences a global crisis of conscience. The
politicization of human suffering and the failure to achieve an
effective international consensus to protect civilian populations in
conflict situations highlight the limitations and inherent flaws of the
current multilateral system. Selective blindness to this tragedy
contrasts sharply with proclamations of moral and humanitarian
leadership. c) Contradictions in Unilateralist Foreign Policy: The
rhetoric and actions of a leader who proclaims himself \"the UN is me\"
often fall into blatant contradictions. [Clear examples include: i.
[Unjustified aggression]{.mark} and then peace order: The [decision to
attack Iran]{.mark} ( e.g. , the assassination of General Qasem
Soleimani ) without clear justification under international law,
followed by the [claim of being able to \"arrange peace between Israel
and Iran,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} underscores a personalistic and
unregulated view of diplomacy. [This unilateral approach [ignores
historical complexity]{.mark}, multiple [actors]{.mark}, and
[established diplomatic processes,]{.mark} assuming that the will of a
single actor can dictate the resolution of deep-rooted regional
conflicts. ii. Broken promises of conflict resolution: The promise to
resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine within \"24 hours\" during an
election campaign represents an extreme [simplification of]{.mark} a
complex [geopolitical conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. The failure to
fulfill such a promise not only exposes a lack of understanding of the
dynamics of armed conflict, but also exploits peace for domestic
political ends, delegitimizing genuine diplomatic efforts and the role
of international organizations in mediation. IV. CONCLUSION The
transition from the absolutist maxim \"I am the State\" to the
contemporary, satirical claim of \"I am the UN\" by leaders who
challenge multilateralism is not only a paradigm shift in the conception
of sovereignty, but also a warning sign about the coherence and
accountability of global governance[. This stance, rooted in nationalism
and [unilateralism]{.mark}, is [compounded by]{.mark} the blatant
[hypocrisy]{.mark} of actors who promote peace while fomenting conflict,
and who selectively defend human rights, ignoring massive tragedies. The
evident contradictions in the foreign policy of figures like [Donald
Trump]{.mark}, who [attack without justification and then \"order\"
peace]{.mark}, or promise magical solutions to complex conflicts,
demonstrate the [danger of this personalistic approach]{.mark} detached
from international law.]{.underline} The \"crazy world\" referred to
reflects a crisis of values and leadership on the international stage.
[[To revitalize the multilateral system]{.mark} and [address]{.mark}
interconnected [global challenges--- from climate change to humanitarian
conflicts]{.mark}---it is imperative to [transcend the rhetoric of
absolute sovereignty]{.mark} and hypocrisy.]{.underline} What is
required is a genuine commitment to cooperation, the primacy of
international law, and an ethical coherence that places human dignity
and peace above particular interests and geopolitical gain. Only in this
way can the international community aspire to more just and effective
governance.

#### The LIO inevitable collapse under Trump 

Caio **Gontijo '25**, \[MSc in International Relations at PUC Minas,
Brazil. His work focuses on political economy, ideology, gramscianism
7-10-2025, \"Global Crisis and the Liberal International Order:
 Critical Nodes in a Totality, *International Studies Review*, Volume
27, Issue 3, September 2025,
viaf013, [[https://doi.org/10.1093/isr/viaf013]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1093/isr/viaf013)\]

The discussion above leads to several key syntheses. Although
the crises that have led to the emergence of far-right movements across
the West may appear to be primarily "national" events within individual
states, this interpretation captures only a partial aspect of a broader
totality. [[Crises of heg]{.mark}emony [are not confined within national
boundaries;]{.mark} like the concept of hegemony itself, [they
are]{.mark} inherently [international in character]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Yet, even this binary framing---national versus international---remains
partial. While it is a more advanced analytical position than a solely
national reading, it still rests on the perspective of external
relations. A more dialectically developed analysis sublates this
opposition by turning to the perspective of internal relations.

From this vantage point, the crisis is global---a structural feature of
a totality---yet it manifests concretely in time and space through
particular nodal points. [[Far-right emergences throughout the West
are]{.mark} thus [not isolated]{.mark} political phenomena [but]{.mark}
concrete [expressions of a deeper global process]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Each represents a node through which the broader crisis of passive
revolution reveals its historical limits. Likewise, the eruption of
recent proxy wars---in Ukraine, in Palestine---should be seen as
geopolitical or military expressions of the same crisis, provided we do
not ontologically separate "war" from "politics."

Just as every totality has predominant moments, so too must we clarify
that [while the current crisis is global, its effects are not evenly
distributed. [The]{.mark} contemporary [crisis]{.mark} of hegemony is
predominantly international in the sense that it [concerns]{.mark} a
specific hierarchical political arrangement: [the
LIO]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the overarching totality remains global
capitalism, the present crisis reflects a breakdown in the reproduction
of its political form---passive revolution. This breakdown is marked by
a shift away from war of position and toward war of manoeuvre: the
intensification of political violence both within Western domestic
contexts and between Western powers and emerging geopolitical actors.

Understanding the Brazilian crisis as a particularly salient nodal
point offers valuable insights into the global conjuncture. Brazil is
simultaneously entangled with the Western LIO, engaged with the BRICS
initiative, and affected by the far-right surge. Just as the universal
expresses itself in the particular, the concept of passive
revolution---while globally relevant---materializes as a national
process. In Brazil, this process appears to encapsulate the
contradictions of the broader global crisis. Its immediate appearance is
one of everyday "small politics" (Coutinho 2010; Gramsci 2015, Q13§5),
involving scandals, partisan disputes, and media spectacle. However,
this surface instability is underpinned by a deeper trajectory. From
1985 to the mid-2010s, Brazil experienced a relatively stable passive
revolution---a fusion of liberal democracy and neoliberalism---well
captured by Brazilian Gramscian thought (Vianna 1996; Coutinho 2012).

On one hand, [this postdictatorship democratic process achieved the
long-awaited political transition to liberal democracy.]{.underline} On
the other, it introduced neoliberal economic restructuring, marked by
deindustrialization, unemployment, and rising inequality. Within the
terrain of common sense, this dynamic produced a latent popular
resentment toward political elites and hegemonic institutions---an
affective pattern echoed across other Western states undergoing
neoliberal transformation. What followed was a series of
"national" crises of hegemony, activated by ideological elements
previously formed during the period of stability. These included
regressive tendencies within common sense---meritocratic individualism,
self-reliance under scarcity, and the erosion of class consciousness.
Even in crisis, hegemony persists as a morbid symptom. These ideological
voids are then filled by far-right intellectual projects, such as
Bolsonarism in Brazil.

[[Both the Western far-right and]{.mark} the [BRICS]{.mark} project [can
be interpreted as]{.mark} violent [negations of]{.mark} political
[liberalism]{.mark}. These negations can be seen, from different angles
of the totality, either as rejections of the recent passive revolution
of neoliberal globalization or as oppositions to the institutional
architecture of the LIO.]{.underline} While these forces may appear
contradictory in the short term---[[Trump's hostility to China]{.mark}
or [Bolsonaro's opposition to]{.mark} Lula and the [BRICS]{.mark}
agenda---they [are ultimately]{.mark} part of [the]{.mark} same
historical process. Their convergence lies not in ideological coherence
but in their [shared challenge to]{.mark} [liberalism as the ideological
framework of global capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This convergence
has led scholars to deploy the concept of illiberalism to capture actors
as diverse as Trump, Putin, Orbán, Xi Jinping, and Bolsonaro.

The expectation of developed countries' leadership is institutionalised
in the United Nations' climate agreements. [Hence, [climate leadership
discussion often builds on the experience of the Global North and
ignores the non-western contexts]{.mark}. This article analyses how
[climate leadership is socially constructed through discourse by
developed and emerging countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Here, developed
countries were limited to Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, New Zealand,
**[and the US]{.mark}**, and emerging countries to the BASIC group,
comprising Brazil, China, India, and South Africa.]{.underline} The
analysis was conducted by drafting storylines and discourse-coalitions
based on national speeches at the UN climate conferences in 2016--2019.
The results underline that the two sides diﬀer primarily in perceptions
of leadership responsibility and problematisation but share ideas about
transition as a problem solution. [Furthermore, neither side constructs
their own leadership on the basis of responsibility, [and the demand for
collective responsibility particularly beneﬁts the Global
North.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The ﬁrst UN agreement to combat climate change, the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), was adopted in 1992.
[Following the principle of common but diﬀerentiated responsibilities
and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), the Convention recognised the
varying national circumstances to act for climate and divided all
nations into developed (Annex I) and developing (non-Annex I)1
parties.]{.underline} [Developed countries were expected to lead the
eﬀorts due to their greater historical emissions and capacity to act and
developing countries' higher vulnerability to climate
change]{.underline}. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted to
operationalise the Convention by setting emission reduction targets for
the developed countries. After Kyoto, the negotiations became
increasingly complex while the US never ratiﬁed the protocol, Canada
withdrew, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan announced that they would
not participate in a second Kyoto period (Gupta 2016). During this time,
the division between developed, and developing became more fragmented
and new negotiation groups began to emerge (Blaxekjær and Nielsen 2015).
The challenges in the negotiations led to the preliminary idea of an
agreement with targets for all the parties. Following this, Paris
Agreement was adopted in 2015 and requested all nations to submit their
nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC secretariat[.
The CBDR-RC principle is institutionalised in all these agreements, but
in the Paris text, it was adopted with the phrase "in light of diﬀerent
national circumstances" weakening [the strict diﬀerentiation between the
North--South]{.mark} (Albuquerque 2021). Nevertheless, the
diﬀerentiation [has remained a perennial question in climate
negotiations before and during Paris]{.mark} (Okereke and Coventry
2016).]{.underline} The post-Paris negotiations have proven diﬃcult, and
the world is not on track to reach the Paris Agreement goal to limit the
global average temperature rise to below 2°C or preferably 1.5°C above
the pre-industrial levels (UNEP 2021). The year 2020 has appeared as a
signiﬁcant line in the post-Paris era dividing it into pre-2020 and
post-2020 action; by this benchmark, parties were expected to increase
their mitigation ambition and developed countries to mobilise USD
100billion per year to address the needs of developing countries. As
achieving these goals has proven challenging, the trust among parties
has decreased. The complexity of climate change and the large variety of
negotiating actors underline the signiﬁcance of leadership in the
success of climate negotiations (Underdal 1994). Raising the level of
ambition requires leaders, as leadership can reinforce trust among
nations and accelerate others' actions (Parker and Karlsson 2010).
Post-Paris time creates a new era for potential new climate leaders.
[Although the Paris Agreement includes the traditional expectation of
developed countries' leadership, it allows new leaders to step up by
committing all nations to act.]{.underline} Due to developed countries'
insuﬃcient leadership, the expectations have increased for emerging
countries; their growing capabilities and emissions have increased hopes
for them to take the lead in tackling climate change in the post-Paris
era. Research on climate leadership has tended to analyse developed
countries, particularly the European Union (EU) and the United States
(US) (Parker and Karlsson 2018), but emerging countries' potential to
lead is increasingly recognised (see for example, Hoch-stetler 2012;
Petrone 2019; Hurri 2020). Furthermore, a research gap has been
identiﬁed on how the emerging powers shape outcomes in international
organisations and how they understand appropriate behaviour in their
mercurial position (Weinhardt 2020). I contribute to this discussion by
deconstructing the narrow western view of climate leadership. I ask: is
there a shared understanding of climate leadership within or between the
Annex II and the BASIC groups in the post-Paris era? In addition, I ask
how these groups attempt to position each other in this argumentative
struggle on climate leadership ?To compare these two contexts, I utilise
argumentative discourse analysis (ADA) and storyline and
discourse-coalition concepts to identify patterns of coherence and
reduce the discursive complexity (Hajer 1995). Storylines and
discourse-coalitions were drafted based on material including national
speeches from the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP) and joint
statements from 2016 to 2019. I compare two groups: developed countries
are deﬁned as the Annex II parties, comprising Australia, Canada,
Iceland, theEU, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the US, and
emerging countries as the BASIC group, a coalition of Brazil, India,
China, and South Africa. The Annex I consist of the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members as of 1992 and
economies in transition (EIT). However, because of EIT countries' weaker
economic position, a new sub-group of Annex II parties was formed out of
richer developed countries (Gupta 2010). As of 20 May 2021, the UNFCCC
explains on its website that Annex II parties are obliged to provide
ﬁnancial support for developing countries' climate mitigation and
adaptation and "take all practicable steps to promote the development
and transfer of environmen-tally friendly technologies to EIT parties
and developing countries". Annex II has notrepresented as an explicit
coalition in the negotiations but for the aim of this study,they
represent the ones who were traditionally expected to take the lead. It
is only byresearching these parties, though as a loose group, that it is
possible to understandhow these traditional leaders construct leadership
in the post-Paris era.Power dynamics within the UNFCCC are changing as
emerging countries increasinglyinﬂuence the negotiations. The
establishment of the BASIC group in 2009 was motivatedby the wish to
highlight their non-western historical and cultural experience and
theirshared Global South identity (Weinhardt 2020). The future of the
BASIC group hasbeen debated since its foundation because, despite their
growing status in worldaﬀairs, the interests of these four countries
diﬀer widely and even conﬂict (Halldinget al. 2013). BASIC countries
have emphasised the CBDR-RC principle but have acceptedthe bottom-up
approach of Paris as it enables them to determine their climate
actionnationally (Albuquerque 2019). In 2020--2021, all four countries
announced their net-zero targets, which can be considered a sign of
willingness to carry more internationalresponsibility. Due to their
conﬂicting interests, the BASIC group cannot be expectedto share a
vision of climate leadership, and therefore, this study aims at
understandingwhich issues they can agree on about climate leadership
with each other and the devel-oped countries.In the following section, I
brieﬂy introduce climate leadership literature. Then, after anoutline of
the materials and method, I present the results, which underline that
the twosides diﬀer primarily in perceptions of leadership responsibility
and problematisation butshare ideas on problem solutions.

2\. Climate leadership

Gupta (2016) has divided the history of climate leadership at the UNFCCC
into the three stages: leadership paradigm (pre-1996), conditional
leadership (1997--2007), and leadership in recession (2008--2020). The
leadership paradigm adopted by the Convention in 1992 committed the
North to lead. The interest behind the leadership paradigm was to create
a regime that included developing countries. This paradigm indicated
mutual trust, the developed countries promised to act ﬁrst, and they
expected the developing countries to follow when the time would come.
The conditional leadership stage began in 1997 after the US withdrawal
from the Kyoto negotiations. Demand grew for the key developing
countries, such as China and India, to increase their participation
because they were claimed to have a competitive advantage over developed
countries who were obliged to change their fossil-energy-based growth
(Audet 2013). Finally, the stage of leadership in recession began with
the economic crisis in 2008, as settingbinding targets for developed
countries proved impossible (Gupta 2016). AlthoughParis Agreement
expects action from all, it nevertheless includes the traditional
expec-tation of developed countries taking the lead. These paradigms
describe the history ofclimate leadership at the UNFCCC, but the
bottom-up approach of the Paris Agreementhas the potential to change the
paradigm in the post-Paris era. Does the stage of leader-ship in
recession continue, or are there signs of a new paradigm with new
potentialleaders?Analytically and empirically leadership has proven a
challenging concept (for an over-view, see Kopra 2020). It is
challenging to deﬁne leadership as distinct from other bar-gaining
behaviour and to set benchmarks for identifying leadership (Skodvin
andAndresen 2006; Eckersley 2020). A leader provides vision and
inspiration, suggests,and implements solutions to a problem (Underdal
1994; Young 1991). [[Leadership in multilateral negotiations is "an
asymmetrical relationship of inﬂuence,]{.mark} where one actorguides or
directs the behaviour of others towards a certain goal over a certain
periodof time"]{.underline} (Underdal 1994, 178). Leadership is an act
between leader and followers; there-fore, it should be deconstructed by
analysing political processes (Nabers 2011). This research turns
attention away from the individual leaders typically researched and
instead understands leadership as "co-constructed by diﬀerent actors
that participate in ﬁnding solutions to collective environmental
problems" (Uusi-Rauva 2010, 75). [[Leadership is often presented as a
universal and achievable concept when in reality]{.mark}; the context of
leadership is seldom highlighted (Case et al. 2015). [This narrow view
and **ignorance of the non-western context can lead to ethnocentric
views** on leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, single-case
studies have dominated discursive environmental research(Leipold et al.
2019). Although the comparative perspective increases the complexityof
the research, in this study, I wish to broaden the view on leadership by
comparingtwo contexts. A comparison between contexts can be the ﬁrst
step to better understand-ing the phenomenon but few studies have
analysed leadership perceptions in diﬀerentparts of the world (Moan and
Hetland 2012).Critical theorists have pointed out that UNFCCC
negotiations and climate change dis-course are guided by the interests,
values, and experiences of the North and that this oftenpasses unnoticed
(Doyle and Chaturvedi 2010; Chakrabarty 2017; Sealey-Huggins 2017).The
North--South aspect is signiﬁcant for this study since the groups
researched representboth sides of this division. Nevertheless, my
intention is not to reinforce this binary division(Acharya and Buzan
2007). Instead, we should broaden our perspective from merely
criti-cising the western perspective to detecting diﬀerent narratives
and storylines about theglobal (Hurrell 2016). I do not wish to
formulate a [non-western perspective on leadership; rather, this article
aims to contribute to a non-universalizing climate leadership
concept]{.underline}.

This dissertation has applied a constructivist approach to role theory
and discursive methodology in an effort to understand how China's
climate leadership is constructed[. This construction is understood as a
gradual process whereperceptions and expectations of climate leadership
change simultaneously in various contexts.]{.underline} These changes
occur in debates that do not necessarily even concern China explicitly[;
expectations of China change when expectations change for developing
countries, major emitters, or emerging countries]{.underline}. In
addition, [expectations of China's climate leadership change when
perceptions of climate leadership change]{.underline}.This dissertation
has covered the first six years of the post-Paris era. China's claims on
the appropriateness of its climate-leader role gradually intensified
during 2016--2021. Based on the findings, [China does not see an
inter-role conflict between the auxiliary role of climate leader and the
master roles of responsible great power and leader of the developing
world.]{.underline} However, [the alter expectations do not seem to
recognize China's strengthening claims on climate leadership, suggesting
an intra-role conflict between the ego and alter
expectations]{.underline}. In addition, external expectations of China
seem to assume that there is an inter-role conflict in China's role set.
Hence, despite China's strengthened ideational and material capabilities
and leadership efforts, during these first six years of the post-Paris
era, the alter expectations of China's climate leadership do not
exemplify a radical change from the pre-Paris era. These ego and alter
expectations support the idea that gradual role changes are more
predominant than rapid shifts since the centrality of roles in a role
set increases or decreases moderately (cf. Breuning, 2019). Yet due to
the recency of China's leadership claims intensifying in 2021 in
particular, future studies are better equipped to analyze the influence
of these claims on alterexpectations. [[Western-centrism]{.mark} at the
UNFCCC [perpetuates a perception of climate leadership that is
constructed on the]{.mark} experiences and [interests of developed
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is reflected, for instance, in
conflicting perceptions of whose responsibility it is to lead, how
successful leadership has been, and [who can play the role of a climate
leader. These conflicts make it [difficult to find shared understandings
of climate leadership that bridge **the Global North-South
divide**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite the promise of role theory to
bridge agency and structure in IR, and its versatile analytical tools,
the ability of role-theoretical analysis to identify these broader,
prevalent constraining structures, such as structural inequality, is not
yet strong enough. Although the scope of empirical cases in role theory
has broadened from the Global North (Breuning, 2019), particularly in
the past, [role-theoretical analyses have focused on the roles of the
most powerful nations]{.underline}. Therefore, the influence of
constraining structures requires more understanding in the future. I
argue that the analysis of [[climate-leader roles needs to take into
account the underlying Western-centrism in global climate
governance]{.mark} as a boundary condition of the social interaction in
which the roles are constructed.]{.underline} The discussion about
[[structures reproducing inequality is clearly more relevant for
developing countries that have fewer ideational and material
capabilities than China]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, in China's case,
the discussion suggests that [[even though China and other emerging
parties might have gained more power]{.mark} during the post-Paris era
negotiations, they might [not]{.mark} have [as much power as could be
assumed based on their growing material
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Breuning (2019) argues that role
theory has the potential to enhance understanding of emerging powers in
particular. Analysis of emerging countries has resulted in the
understanding that the increase in their material capabilities does not
unequivocally lead to a change in their identities and foreign policy
behavior (Thies & Nieman, 2017). Instead, the change happens gradually
in response to growing material capabilities and a range of domestic and
international explanations (Thies & Nieman, 2017). China's case provides
an example of how material changes, such as its growing emissions and
capabilities, generate needs for constructions, namely the need for
China's role to be reviewed. However, [these changes do not squarely
grant China a particular role [because climate-leader roles are
constructed in social interaction]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this sense[,
[China's case exemplifies the constructivist ontology]{.mark}, meaning
that although the focus on material power should not be excessive, the
material forces should not be dismissed as these social constructions
are not arbitrary or independent of the actor's material
capabilities]{.underline}. I contribute to the discussion on the
boundary conditions of social interaction by demonstrating how the
**[underlying [Western-centrism can]{.mark} even [create role conflicts,
and consequently narrow the idea of who can be acknowledged as a climate
leader]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the structures of the UNFCCC
[[reproduce global hierarchies in favor of large, Western,
English-speaking delegations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Falzon, 2021), these
structures decrease recognition of China's climate leadership efforts
and [constrain the roles that China can play [in global climate
governance]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, this dissertation argues
that taking the conflicts surrounding China's role for granted, and
assuming that China's adherence to a developing country identity equates
with its unwillingness to lead, creates [a narrow view of China's role
in global climate governance in the post-Paris era and may even
contribute to perpetuating a Western-centric perception of climate
leadership]{.underline}. I do not wish to emphasize the structure as a
determinant of China's roles, but rather to [[question whether a climate
leader can have a developing country identity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These findings open up new questions that could be answered by the
approach taken by this dissertation. An approach combining discursive
methodology with constructivist role theory would be equipped to respond
to questions about how individuals, states, and others construct their
climate leadership at the international level. For instance, future
studies could ask how constructions of climate leadership vary at the
individual level between different US presidents, or at the state level
between democratic India and authoritarian China. Furthermore, moving
beyond the state-centrism of this research, this approach could be
applied to explore whether [the Western-centrism underlying global
climate governance becomes visible in recognizing the climate leadership
of non-state actors]{.underline}. As complex challenges such as climate
change call for more functionally specific roles (Harnisch et al.,
2011), future studies should pay more attention to understanding changes
and tensions particularly between different auxiliary roles and between
master and auxiliary roles. The identified role conflict between climate
leadership and developing country identity raises important questions
that deserve further attention beyond China and climate leadership.
Using the approach adopted by this dissertation, one could research
whether similar conflicts are visible in the role expectations of other
powerful actors outside the Global North. Besides China, this question
would also be relevant for other emerging nations such as Brazil and
India, or SIDS, for instance. Analyzing these potential conflicts could
enhance understanding of the kind of underlying assumptions that exist
about the roles that can be played simultaneously, and whether these
assumptions vary between the Global North and South. In particular,
[[the Global South expectations deserve more attention]{.mark} in order
[to raise awareness of]{.mark} how **[the structures favoring the Global
North]{.mark}** are reflected in them]{.underline}. The Global South
role expectations would be particularly interesting in China's case
because if it wishes to uphold the role of leader of the developing
world, these expectations will have a strong impact on China's roles. In
this sense, the self-declared leadership of China studied in Article III
could be supplemented with a further analysis of external recognition.
Given China's role as the leader of the Global South, an analysis of the
LDCs' or G-77 nations' expectations of China could improve understanding
of the variation within the Global South; not all developing or emerging
countries have similar expectations of China. Future analyses of
external expectations of China, based for instance on voting patterns in
other international institutions or attitudes toward China's investments
in the Global South, could help answer Torney's (2019) thorny question
about how followership materializes. Here, role theory could tackle the
challenges involved in identifying followership in the climate
leadership literature (e.g., Torney 2019) by analyzing whether
followership can be detected as part of an actor's egoexpectations, or
whether it remains a counter-role that prospective leaders seek to
altercast onto others. This dissertation provides insights into role
expectations based on forma lcommunication in the UNFCCC context, such
as the high-level segments. These choices inevitably influence the
outcome as roles are defined in a context, which makes them "limited in
time and scope" and "dependent on the group's structure and purpose"
(Harnisch, 2011a, p. 8). Supplementing the analysis presented here with
interviews would have allowed the inclusion of more informal
communication than the exploration of national speeches at the annual
COPs. Interviews could have complemented the analysis of alter
expectations in particular because they might have revealed more
explicit expectations of China. Hence, combining formal and informal
communication in future investigations could provide a more
comprehensive view of the alter expectations. Including interviews might
also serve to broaden the ego expectations. However, given China's
authoritarian regime, I believe that the value of interviews in
supplementing the speeches and documents prepared by the
foreign-policy-making elite would not have been as great as in the case
of alter expectations. My choice to approach climate leadership through
role theory naturally limits the questions that can be asked about
China's climate leadership. [This approach enabled me to answer several
"how" questions in depth and focus on the discursive understanding of
China's climate leadership, but not analyze leadership
implementation.]{.underline} Yet analyzing the roles of states furthers
understanding of how they wish to be seen by others and how they
position themselves vis-à-vis others. I reviewed the credibility of
China's leadership mainly based on the social interaction between China
and its significant others and how these others accepted China's claims.
Due to the recency of China's promises announced in 2021, these claims
have not yet materialized, which means that fully analyzing the
implementation dimension at this stage would not have been possible. By
including this dimension, future studies could compare role play and
role performance, and duly evaluate the credibility of China's
leadership claims more comprehensively. Nevertheless, from the
perspective of global inequality, the focus on the discursive
constructions of reality is justified because generalizations and
processesof inclusion and exclusion make these discursive constructions
"important realms of power" (Hajer, 1995, p. 21). During this project,
ADA enabled me to immersemyself in language nuances that appear to be
shared. Due to these nuances, sharedunderstandings are easily
interpreted ambiguously (e.g., Hajer, 1995). However, atleast in the way
I applied ADA, its limitation lay in its inability to uncover what
wasnot discussed. The method did not provide an explicit analytical way
to pinpointwhat is excluded from the storylines. On the one hand, I see
this limitation asresulting from my state-centric focus; with a broader
focus, the storylines at theelite policy-making level could have been
compared to storylines subscribed to by67scientists and journalists, for
instance, to better justify what was omitted at the statelevel. On the
other hand, this limitation derived from the aim to go beyond
thecritique of the Global North. In line with this objective, the aim
was to find commonground rather than exclusions. ADA allowed the search
for this ground in thecontext of the discursive complexity of global
climate governance. It facilitatedfinding both shared and conflicting
ways to talk about [[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} leadership
betweenactors and groups with differing interests and worldviews. In
another researchdesign, exclusions could be made more visible by
applying Critical DiscourseAnalysis (CDA) instead of ADA. CDA strives to
understand the underlyingideological agendas and discrimination (Leipold
et al., 2019), which would help to comprehend how [[discourses reproduce
historical inequalities and whose voices go unheard in the role
expectations of climate leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline} More generally,
by incorporating more critical reviews of Western-centrism, the climate
leadership literature could intensify its contribution to the
discussions on climate responsibility and justice. [Understanding
climate [leadership based on the experiences of developed countries
affects the efficiency]{.mark} and ambition [of climate leadership as
their leadership has proved to be inadequate and constructed on
favorable framings. Due to weakly defined climate-leadership
goals]{.mark} [and the]{.mark} excessive [focus on the negotiation
phase]{.mark}]{.underline}, the ambition of prospective leaders is not
linked to the Paris Agreement goals. Therefore, the aspirations of an
effective climate leader need to be defined in various contexts, in
accordance with the Paris Agreement goals, in order to emphasize the
relevance of climate leadership as an analytical concept. Such an
application will most likely decrease the number of recognized climate
leaders, but will steer efforts toward the 1.5˚C path and not remain at
the level of comparing the ambition of different actors. In addition, it
should be emphasized that the leadership expectations of the Paris
Agreement not only concern mitigation but also taking the lead in
climate finance and sustainable lifestyles, consumption, and production.
Analyzing discursive constructions of reality serve as a reminder of the
dangers of considering a perception to be universal. Such narrowness can
often be observed in the media during the annual COPs: the roles of
different actors are defined from the perspective of a particular
worldview. For instance, the newspaper headlines quoted at the beginning
of this dissertation define the negotiation position of developing
countries and China from a Finnish perspective. However, the positioning
might be entirely different if the headlines were written from a
Burundian or Chinese perspective. These differences must be recognized
in order to find common ground on climate leadership. In this
dissertation, common ground between [[emerging and developed
nations]{.mark} was mainly found in the context of climate solutions,
but the two sides [differ]{.mark}ed [in]{.mark} particular in [their
perceptions of climate problematization and leadership
responsibilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to cooperation and
more ambitious climate action by China and other nations, achieving the
Paris goals will require finding and building shared understanding,
especially between the Global North and South. [We all need China's
climate action to increase. To this end, ignoring and [rejecting the
importance of the Global South]{.mark} identity for China [is
not]{.mark} necessarily [the]{.mark} quickest or [**easiest strategy to
enhance**]{.mark} the [**global cooperation**]{.mark} needed to achieve
carbon neutrality]{.underline}.

[Numerous [examples highlight leadership and real climate action in the
Global South]{.mark}. With financial support from and partnership with
countries in the Global North, [this leadership can be a cornerstone
for]{.mark} getting on track to [meeting the Paris
Agreement]{.mark}.]{.underline} The headlines from the recent COP26
climate conference in Glasgow cast countries from the Global South in a
starkly negative light. The media criticized India's announcement that
it will meet its emissions targets only by 2070 (ref. 1), two decades
behind the United States and European Union, as well as Nigeria's pledge
to reach net zero by 2060 and plans to heavily use natural gas2 as a
transitional fuel until 2040. The Washington Post called Brazil a
"climate antagonist"3, while China --- the world's second-largest
economy and top greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter --- was largely absent from
the conference4. [These talking points overlook the ambitious actions
already taken by the Global South to cut GHG emissions and enhance
natural carbon sinks, despite the socioeconomic cards stacked against
it.]{.underline} Stopping climate change requires collaboration among
all stakeholders. [To foster such collaboration, high-income countries
must acknowledge the contributions of low- and middle-income countries
towards climate action, while working with and learning from them to
accelerate climate-positive practices and policies]{.underline}. Many
nations in the Global South face the most dire impacts of global
warming, yet emit only a fraction of the world's GHGs. Per capita CO2
emissions are 1.8 metric tons per year (t yr−1) in India, and 2 t yr−1
in Brazil --- far lower than the global average of 4.8 t yr−1. Even
China's annual per capita emissions of 7.4 t are less than half those of
the United States, which clock in at 15.2 t (ref. 5). [Furthermore,
[these nations are being asked to leapfrog fossil fuels on their paths
to development]{.mark} --- something no Global North country has ever
even attempted --- [without receiving the capacity-building and
financial support they will need]{.mark} to do so. Despite these
challenges, Global South nations are mobilizing innovative solutions to
cut emissions across all sectors.]{.underline}

Food, agriculture and oceans Although destructive practices in the
Global South, such as the destruction of Brazil's rainforest and
overfishing in China, have rightfully earned the ire of the world,
broadly speaking [[the Global South performs better than the Global
North within]{.mark} these sectors.]{.underline} First, [many Global
South [food systems]{.mark} have substantially smaller footprints than
those in the Global North. The Indian diet, for example, is largely
plant rich]{.underline} --- Indians consume only 5 kg of meat per person
per year, compared with the world average of 43 kg. [Smallholder
farmers, who are key to scaling regenerative agricultural practices with
lower climate impacts [and]{.mark} carbon drawdown potential, are well
represented in the Global South,]{.underline} producing 30--34% of food
grown there6. Moreover[, many Global South countries have adopted
resource-efficient methods of growing food]{.underline}; Brazil, for
example, has 77.3% of its total irrigated area under micro-irrigation,
[compared with 56.5% in the United States. The Global South is also
leading the way with respect to [the oceans]{.mark}. Of 15 countries on
the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, which aims to
sustainably manage 100% of its member nations' waters, more than half
are from the Global South. [Brazil prohibits bottom trawling]{.mark}
below 600 m in most of its national waters --- protecting both marine
fauna and the carbon stored in the seabed[. In contrast, the European
Union has the highest bottom-trawling footprint]{.mark} in the world.
Many [Global South nations are also turning their coastal waters into
carbon sinks through seaweed farming]{.mark}, a powerful ocean-based
climate solution.]{.underline} In 2018, China and Indonesia alone were
responsible for around 85% of global seaweed production. Meanwhile,
[coastal communities in Africa are building seaweed farms as well. In
addition to the carbon benefits, these are providing jobs, food and
capacity building for local communities]{.underline}.

Transportation and energy [[The Global South is also well positioned to
lead the 'race to zero emissions' in the transportation and energy
sectors]{.mark}. India has the fourth longest rail network in the
world10,]{.underline} and electrified more than 5,000 km of rail as part
of its plan to electrify its entire network by 2030 (ref. 11). It plans
to add more than 1,000 km of metro line by 2030, and has 9 high-speed
rail lines in development10. Only 6% of Indians own a car and 35% use
bicycles, compared with 88% and 13% in the United States,
respectively12. [Meanwhile, [renewable energy sources produce 37% of
India's electricity, compared with less than 20% in the European Union
and the United States]{.mark}13]{.underline}.Brazil is the birthplace of
bus rapid transit (BRT), an innovative public transit system that more
than 20 million passengers across South America ride each day. BRT has
had a significant impact on congestion and air pollution in many cities,
contributing to reduced emissions14 (Fig. 1). [[Brazil is]{.mark} also
[the world leader in biofuel and waste energy use]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- 50% of its total energy supply comes from these sources15, and 75%
of its light vehicle fleet uses ethanol fuel[. [China has more than half
of the world's electric cars]{.mark}, more than 90% of its electric
buses and trucks, and the largest electric-vehicle-charging
infrastructure in the world16. It also has the most high-speed rail
lines17]{.underline}. Only 17% of Chinese people own cars, and 25% use
bicycles12. [While it currently meets only 28% of its energy demand
using renewable sources18, China is making strides to further green its
electricity grid19, which could one day make it home to the world's
largest zero-emissions transportation sector.]{.underline}

Policy and investment [Many of these [innovations and infrastructure
improvements]{.mark} have been driven by government policy and
investment from both public and private sources. The impetus for acting
in the Global South reflects the need to address economic development by
protecting and sustainably using natural resources, improving
livelihoods and promoting more inclusive growth]{.underline}. Moving
ahead by adopting climate solutions to leapfrog fossil-fuel development
helps achieve these goals, while avoiding the need to decarbonize their
economies in the future, and [[position]{.mark}s [countries as leaders
in a global green economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the policy side,
Nigeria followed COP26 by passing its Climate Change Act, which includes
key provisions for a REDD+ registry, a climate change fund, natural
capital accounts, carbon budgets and a national council on climate
change. The act seeks to provide a legal framework for how Nigeria plans
to respond to the Paris Agreement by committing to protecting its forest
resources, improving sustainable transport and abating methane
emissions. [New [financial instruments are being developed across the
Global South]{.mark} to stimulate further green innovation]{.underline}.
For example, Pakistan may begin to issue nature performance bonds, which
could help solve the sovereign debt crisis by tying it to measurable
climate and biodiversity indicators20. In 2022, Chile made history by
issuing the first sovereign sustainability-linked bond, with investor
demand four times higher than its initial US\$2 billion issuance21. Many
countries in the Global South have also made significant policy
interventions and investments in education access and reproductive
health services over the past few decades. These rights-based
interventions can help avoid around \~40 Gt of GHG emissions by 2050
(ref. 22). In India and Nigeria, secondary school completion rates
increased from 10.9% to 37.2% and from 11.5% to 45%, respectively,
between 2000 and 2017 (ref. 23). Meanwhile, between 1990 and 2019,
voluntary family-planning uptake increased throughout Central and
Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and in Latin America and the
Caribbean. In addition to initiatives led by the Global South, recently
launched international initiatives, such as the Build Back Better World
(B3W) initiative and the Just Energy Transition Fund, may also play a
crucial role supporting solution implementation. However, these types of
initiatives are reminiscent of the unmet pledge made by high-income
countries at COP15 in Copenhagen to raise US\$100 billion per year in
climate finance by 2020. The success of these new initiatives relies on
evasion of the flaws that marred the realization of the COP15 pledge for
over a decade24.

Working in partnership [Climate mitigation and adaptation solutions in
the Global South are critical to stopping global warming and should
undoubtedly be a focal point of efforts to curb emissions, enhance
carbon drawdown and promote climate resiliency. [Countries in the Global
South offer perhaps **the greatest potential** for the rapid
implementation of natural climate solutions and are ripe markets for
carbon-leapfrogging technologies.]{.mark}]{.underline} There is also an
acute need to act quickly to avoid and/or adapt to climate-related
challenges already being felt. [However, the Global North should
recognize Global South countries for the strides they have taken,
particularly [given that the Global North's historic and current
emissions form the bulk of atmospheric GHG concentrations]{.mark}.
Countries in the Global North should further acknowledge the deep
historical economic inequities that contribute to the differentiated
implementation of climate solutions.]{.underline} They must recommit to
the 'common but differentiated responsibilities' principle formalized in
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 and,
while acknowledging existing progress, provide tangible financial
support for further advancing climate solutions. Climate change affects
us all. Partnerships at local, regional and international scales are key
to the successful implementation of climate solutions, and the strongest
partnerships are those built on mutual respect and shared goals25. To
achieve the ambitious 1.5 °C warming target, we will need all hands
working together in an equitable way. Only through true partnership
between the Global North and Global South, and shared recognition of
advances made in countries around the world, can we ever hope to advance
climate action.

[[The second Trump administration]{.mark} has announced various
anti-climate policies under its "America first" strategy. Leaving the
Paris agreement, kicking off a trade war, shutting down USAid and
drilling for more oil and gas [will not only undermine the US's
international reputation but will undermine the global effort to combat
climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline} With the US in retreat from climate
action and Europe preoccupied by security challenges[, [new leadership
is urgently needed]{.mark}. [China may be poised to fill this
gap]{.mark}. The country is [already dominant in most clean
technologies, and]{.mark} its top leaders say climate action can help
the country fulfill its responsibilities as a major power.]{.underline}
The Chinese president, [[Xi]{.mark} Jinping, reiterated this message at
a recent closed-door meeting of heads of state, organised by the UN
secretary general to discuss the climate crisis]{.underline}. After
nodding to the Trump-initiated global economic shock[, [Xi said China
"will]{.underline}]{.mark} [overcome the headwinds and steadily [move
forward global climate governance"]{.mark}.]{.underline} But to take on
this leadership, Beijing must first strengthen [China]{.mark}'s domestic
policies along with its support for climate action in the global south.
[The [country has made remarkable progress on clean energy]{.mark} and
its carbon emissions may peak this year]{.underline}. But more than 60%
of the electricity generated in the country still comes from coal, and
it remains unclear how fast the government plans to phase out fossil
fuels. Meanwhile, some provincial governments are still issuing permits
to add new coal-fired power plants. There are things China can do almost
immediately to show its commitment to climate action and rebuild
international confidence in the Paris agreement. [First, it must set
very ambitious pledges to reduce its emissions for the coming decades
ahead of this year's UN climate conference (Cop30) to be held in
November in Belém, Brazil]{.underline}. China was one of the many
countries that missed a February deadline for submitting its targets
(only 15 countries were on time). [Until now, Beijing's strategy has
been to "wait and see" given the turbulence caused by the new Trump
administration. [What China ends up pledging will have a profound impact
on global ambition]{.mark}. An ambitious target might mean reducing its
emissions from their peak level by at least 30%. [This is]{.mark} still
[achievable if the country can maintain its current progress in
renewables]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite the missed deadline, there are
some positive noises coming from Beijing. In a recent high-level meeting
organised by the UN secretary general, [[Xi announced that
China's]{.mark} next set of emission [reduction targets]{.mark},
covering the period up to 2035, [will cover all economic sectors and all
greenhouse gases]{.mark}.]{.underline} This will be a major progress
compared to China's previous pledges, which only covered carbon dioxide
(China is the world's biggest emitter of the potent greenhouse gas
methane, for instance) and did not integrate national targets into
individual sectoral policies. [[China has also been instrumental in
bridging gaps between developed and developing countries]{.mark} in
recent international talks]{.underline}. This was especially the case
during negotiations at Cop29 last year in Baku, Azerbaijan, for a new
global climate finance goal. [Climate finance, in this context, refers
to providing developing countries with the resources [to help them
reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change]{.mark}. [China still
has developing country status]{.mark}]{.underline} in the UN's climate
change convention and, as such, has no official obligation to provide
international climate finance. [[Despite this, it has already]{.mark}
provided or [helped raise around]{.mark} US\$[24.5 billion]{.mark}
(£18.32 billion) [for clean energy, disaster recovery]{.mark} and other
climate actions [in developing countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} That
makes it the world's fifth-largest climate finance donor according to
some estimates. But for this investment to have a lasting impact,
Beijing needs to be more transparent about where its funding goes and
how projects are financed. It should also get local people more involved
in designing and implementing the projects it funds. [China]{.mark}
should also play a major role in reforming the global financial system
to make it aligned with the Paris agreement. [As a strong supporter of
green finance, it [can influence upcoming international talks]{.mark}
such as the Financing for Development conference in Seville, as well as
the UN's negotiations on international tax cooperation. As co-chair of
the G20's sustainable finance working group, China also has the
opportunity [to push for more funding to support net
zero]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China is]{.mark} by far [the world's
biggest producer of renewables, batteries, electric vehicles]{.mark} and
many other clean technologies, and is in a unique position to supply
them affordably]{.underline}. While it has already exported lots of
these products, many developing countries still don't have the know-how
or the basic infrastructure to make the most of them (solar farms are of
limited use if you don't have a battery capable of storing the
electricity they generate, for instance[). [China can]{.mark} address
this by [partner]{.mark}ing [with other governments in the global
south]{.mark} to share technologies and invest in manufacturing[. **With
global climate leadership at risk, China has the chance to step
up**]{.mark}. As an emerging superpower with advantages in clean
technologies and a leadership that recently reaffirmed their commitment
to climate action, **[the country is well positioned]{.mark}**. The
world is watching to see if China will follow through.]{.underline}

The role of anti-science rhetoric in right-wing populism

[Climate change denial has been found to correlate positively with
right- wing ideological political beliefs, according to a recent
multi-nation study eL e S A ZeHnD o RFeR12 6 by Jylhӓ & Hellmer (2020),
with political narratives that focus on climate change observed to be a
polarising subject (e.g. Whitmarsh & Cornel, 2017). In embracing this
denial, Trump was able to appeal directly to a conservative base.
Populist right-wing parties, usually led by a charismatic individual,
also tend to dismiss climate change (e.g. Lockwood, 2018, Forchtner,
Kroneder &Wetzel, 2018) as part of a wider strategy that embraces
socially conserva- tive ideologies (Mudde, 2007).]{.underline} RW
charismatic populism tends to embrace the communication of traditional
values whilst romanticising nationalistic notions, usually to the
detriment of minority groups. Given that RW populism tends to focus on
denigrating attacks on the 'other' -- that is, minority groups (such as
Jews in 1930s Germany, and Muslims and Mexicans under the Trump
administration) (e.g. Lobban et al., 2020), [the [conscious effort to
reject liberal, egalitarian values]{.mark} might [represent]{.mark} not
only an ideological approach but an associated, [conscious strategic
effort to appeal to a conservative base]{.mark}. Charisma, populism and
climate change denial [Right-wing populism]{.mark}, interestingly,
[is]{.mark} [generally characterised by]{.mark} a scepti- cism towards
climate policy and a [far lower readiness to support action on climate
change]{.mark} (e.g. Lockwood, 2018, McCright et al., 2016) with a
recent 12-country study of 13 right-wing populist parties demonstrating
a clear anti-environmental bias (Gemenis et al., 2012).]{.underline}
Further, Hamilton and Saito (2015) and Shao (2017) found intra-party
differences in the US Republican Party where Tea Party members (a
far-right faction of the Republican Party) held far more pronounced
views that related to climate scepticism than their more moderate
conservative counterparts. It is interesting that 'aversion to wealth
distribution partly mediates the correlation between Trump support and
climate change denial' (Jylhӓ & Hellmer (2020, p. 3) and that climate
change denial also correlates with racist and anti-immigrant views,
Social Dominance Orientation and Right- Wing Authoritarianism (ibid., p.
12). [They are also most likely to hold anti- immigration views, which
Trump's aggressive anti-immigration stance courts and amplifies
powerfully.8 It also appears to be [linked with a pro-conspiracy
mindset]{.mark} (Lewandowsky, Oberauer & Gignac, 2013) and is predicted
by anti-establishment attitudes,]{.underline} T He W e A P o nIS AT I o
n o F CL IM AT e CH A n Ge 1 2 7 traditional values and anti-egalitarian
practices, which in turn were found to be positive predictors of
pseudoscientific beliefs (Jylhӓ & Hellmer 2020, p. 8). [Together, the
conflagration of these observed beliefs forms a strong likelihood of
climate change and anti-science denial (Rutjens, Sutton & van der Lee,
2017) alongside a willingness to instead invest in, and welcome,
conspiracies and pseudo-science. [Trump's rhetoric clearly]{.mark} plays
to and [amplifies these]{.mark} preferences and [descriptors whilst
seemingly also betraying a personal tendency to conform to these
cognitive descriptors]{.mark} (e.g. 'Any and all weather events are used
by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our
planet! They don't believe it! \$\$\$\$' (@realdonaldtrump, 26 January
2014).]{.underline} The administration utilises propagandist techniques
to amplify Trump's environmental narrative; a recent Brown University
doctoral study found that roughly 25% of all cli- mate change denial
tweets are in fact produced by mechanised bot activity (Marlow et al.,
2020). Research also identifies that the Big Five trait of 'openness'
(McCrae & Costa, 2008) correlates negatively with climate change denial,
likely because it reflects a greater acceptance of the status quo and
predicts acceptance of group-based hierarchies (Jylhӓ, 2016), whilst
dampening a readiness to reject novel, complex ideas (such as those that
emerge throughout the sci- entific process). Since the early 1990s,
there is evidence that conservative think tanks explicitly formed to
counter environmental decision-making (De Pryck & Gemenne, 2017),
engaging with a wider network of actors in manufacturing uncertainty
(e.g. Dunlap, 2013) such as energy giants Koch Industries and the George
C. Marshall Institute think tank. Thus, the Trump administration is
capitalising on the anti-environmental work of a powerful, existing
sub-culture (the Republican Party and associated actors). The party has
(as it currently appears) largely ceded control to Trump, and it is
Trump who is now capitalising on that work, and on the embedded
anti-environmental beliefs of its followers. Science vs. rhetoric
Comparing scientific consensus relating to anthropogenic climate change
with Republican commentary offers a compelling insight into the forces
that drive both beliefs: Republican senator for Kentucky, Rand Paul, for
example, recently shared his disdain for scientific evidence of climate
eL e S A ZeHnD o RFeR12 8 change (e.g. Brulle, 2018; Dunlap & McCright,
2008; Kool, 2010) by saying that: I think this debate has become so
dumbed down beyond belief \... We have real data \[for\] about 100
years. So somebody tell me what 100 years' data is in an earth that is
4.6 billion years old? My guess is that the conclusions you make from
that are not conclusive. Politicians might make guesses about science,
but scientists, of course, do not. Anthropogenic climate change simply
describes 'a statistically significant variation in either the mean
state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended
period' (VijayaVenkataRaman, Iniyan & Goic, 2012, p. 879). [It is
apolitical but has been rendered political, at least in the perceptions
of [right-wing voters]{.mark}, who now [view climate change as a
'liberal' concept]{.mark}. The evidence for, [and]{.mark} broad
scientific consensus around, the concept of climate change is immense
(e.g. NASA, n.d.), yet it runs counter to RW populist ambitions to
acknowledge it. Creationism vs. climate [change Creationist education
policy has grown notably during Trump's presidency]{.mark} (National Law
Review, 2019), representing a favouring of Christian prot- estant
evangelism and a courting of faith-based agencies by the administration
[at the same time as the scientific and academic organisations have been
attacked and vilified]{.mark}]{.underline}. The strategic favouring of
religion is a common feature of authoritarian and totalitarian states,
as is the denigration of science (Linz, 2004). The movement to support
creationism and faith-based academic approaches in favour of scientific
content has received high-level support within the Republican Party;
former Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos
both vigorously supported the teaching of creationist theory, falsely
communicating the supposition that creationism simply offers a competing
theory to evolution. Both have furthered this narrative despite a US
Supreme Court ruling that forcing a requirement to teach creationism in
schools would represent a clear violation of the First Amendment's
Establishment Clause (a clause which exists to prevent 'sponsorship,
financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity').11 T He W e A P o nIS AT I o n o F CL IM AT e CH A n Ge 1 2 9
The weaponisation of truth: religion vs. science Trump's relationship
with religion, most notably the Evangelical Christian movement, remained
a powerful boon to his continued position as POTUS, even in the face of
a recent impeachment (a reported 81% of US Christian Evangelicals voted
for Trump in 2016).12 This enthusiastic support, confusing to many
observers, might hold its roots in American Evangelical history. Science
denial first gained traction in the context of Darwinism in the late
1800s in the USA, and less than a century ago, teaching evolutionary
science was still illegal in Texas. The GOP has historically formed a
close bond with the Protestant Evangelical movement -- a bond that the
current administration is exploiting effectively. White American
Evangelical Protestants are most likely amongst all religious groups to
be sceptical of climate change, with only 27% believing that climate
change is real (Jones, Cox & Navarro-Rivera, 2014). It is this sector of
the GOP votership that is often described as the 'base' of the
Republican Party (Brint & Abrutyn, 2010[). [If the campaign slogan 'Make
America Great Again' is]{.mark} to be [considered, rightly]{.mark}, a
form of [revivalist nationalism]{.mark}, [then it would]{.mark} be
sensible to [include creationism and the removal of evolution
theory]{.mark} as one key part of that patchwork American revivalist
nostalgia that the MAGA campaign has tapped so powerfully
into.]{.underline} Science, God and a cult of charisma The powerfully
symbiotic relationship that the Republican Party has historically
enjoyed with the conservative Christian right has undoubtedly
strengthened further under the Trump administration: 3 January 2020, for
example, saw the launch of Evangelicals for Trump in Florida, a key bat-
tleground state, with President Trump promoting a powerful and popular
Pentacostal mega-church evangelist named Paula White-Cain to lead the
White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative. White is a major presence
in the Evangelicals for Trump organisation, often hosting religious
prayer events where various Evangelical pastors pray openly for Trump,
sometimes even engaging in a 'laying on hands' activity when Trump
himself is present. As Trump's Presidential tenure progressed and
accusations of moral tur- pitude increased, support from mainstream
religion waned. The influential eL e S A ZeHnD o RFeR13 0 religious
publication Christianity Today, for example, denounced Trump as 'grossly
immoral' (Galli, 2019). A rejection by some in mainstream religion may
explain in part Trump's higher engagement with mega-church pastors such
as Paula White-Cain over more orthodox figures in the mainstream
Christian movement; it removes the bureaucratic checks-and-balances of
an established religious organisation, further removing limits on his
behav- iour, yet still conveys an image of a high-profile, close
relationship with religion. As the relationship has been cultivated, so
references to Trump's Messianic status have also increased; Trump, for
example, referred to his recent Covid-19 diagnosis as a 'blessing from
God' in a video posted to Twitter (@realdonaldtrump, 7 October 2020).
According to Eatwell (2004), the leader is driven by a special mission
(p. 106); he positions himself as a superman, a Messiah figure, endowed
with special powers (Weber, 1968). Trump's self-positioning as a man
endowed by supernatural qualities can thus be considered a common
charismatic leadership strategy. The 'laying on hands' imagery and the
direct equation of Trump with God himself invokes powerfully the
Weberian 'Messiah' image so sought after by the charismatic populist
leader (Weber, 1968). Controlling the narrative [[The goal of RW
charismatic populists is to control the political narrative and to
transfer expert power from]{.mark} experts (e.g. [scientists]{.mark})
[to that of his own voice]{.mark} and coterie (e.g. Homolar & Scholz,
2019). [Science]{.mark} has long been viewed as a pillar of democracy,
exerting key checks-and-balances that act to constrain (and facilitate)
executive power (Collins & Evans, 2019) -- thus it makes sense that it
[would become a natural target to]{.mark} a leader of this
kind.]{.underline}

Realist scholars are wont to point out that, because economic growth and
wealth creation form the bedrock of a nation's latent and military
power, [public officials will tend to be reluctant to enter
[international agreements]{.mark} which, they fear, [might undermine the
ability of]{.mark} their [nations to create wealth]{.mark} (Mearsheimer
2003). [This]{.mark} fear [has been one of the factors behind
the]{.mark} frequent [lack of diligence of U.S. public officials with
regard to climate change.]{.mark}]{.underline} Until now, fossil fuels
have been identified as both the main cause of human-made climate change
and the driving force behind economic expansion in the U.S. and
elsewhere (McNeill 2016). Without exploita- tion of coal, oil, and
natural gas on a monumental scale, the indus- trialization first of
European countries, the U.S., and a few others, then of emerging
countries like China, Brazil, and India, would have been unthinkable.
According to the Energy Information Administration (2020), for instance,
80% of primary energy consumed in the U.S. in 2019 was derived from
coal, oil, and natural gas. In like manner, the use of fossil fuels,
particularly coal and oil, has laid the groundwork for China's
spectacular economic ascent over the last four decades. From a realist
standpoint, it makes little sense to expect those two geopolitical
rivals to adhere to climate agreements that have the potential to allow
one to make relative gains at the expense of the other. This trend was
very often on display when Republican Presidents were in office.
Although the evidence suggests that George H. W. Bush was more inclined
to take climate change seriously than his two Repub- lican successors,
his administration made it plain that no compromise would be made on
U.S. economic prosperity, and that preserving U.S. economic
competitiveness would be a core objective. On the one hand, he signed
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which
still serves as the main foundation for the current international
climate regime, and went on record as saying that the U.S. would
confront the climate challenge head-on, but, on the other hand, his
administration did its utmost to empty the framework of a large part of
its substance by ruling out any binding mechanism and refusing to
consider mutually agreed upon targets and timetables (Layzer 2012,
168--169). [An even more obvious illustration of this stance was Donald
Trump's quest for "energy dominance." Energy dominance meant that the
U.S. would try to go beyond energy independence, by extracting its vast
fossil fuel resources as much as possible so as to satisfy its own
needs, while being able to export some of them. This, according to its
proponents, would stimulate economic growth at home, and enhance U.S.
power and influence abroad.]{.underline} For instance, the Trump
administration hoped to boost exports of liquified natural gas (LNG) as
a means of making up for economic losses resulting from its trade war
with China, and of less- ening European dependence on Russian gas.
[Likewise, robust U.S. shale oil production made it possible to keep the
supply of oil steady even as the Trump administration slapped more
sanctions on Iran (Yergin 2020, 39--40). In a way that is reminiscent of
[realist thinking]{.mark}, President Trump [viewed economic competition
as a zero-sum game in which the U.S. was to make the most of its huge
fossil fuel resources, not just to enhance national prosperity, but also
to wield more influence overseas]{.mark}]{.underline}. This goal,
needless to say, can hardly be reconciled with bona fide U.S. climate
leadership. The attitudes of Democratic officials have been more
ambivalent. Bill Clinton, after all, did sign the Kyoto protocol in
1998, and Barack Obama was one of the main architects of the Paris
Accord. President Biden is set to make use of substantially larger
amounts of federal funding than any of his predecessors to foster the
energy transition through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
passed by the U.S. Congress in November 2021. It would be inaccurate to
argue that Democrats and Republicans are indis- tinguishable on climate
and that no action is ever taken in the U.S. [Yet, on further
examination, the [Democratic contributions to climate]{.mark} action and
[leadership have]{.mark} also [been severely limited by concerns about
relative economic gains and U.S. competitiveness.]{.mark} From 1993
onwards, the Clinton administration tried to move forward on climate,
but was thwarted by Republican opposition and by the reluc- tance of
some Democrats from coal-rich states]{.underline}. Ahead of COP3 in
Kyoto, the Clinton administration tried to lead by signaling its support
for a binding mechanism to bring about mandatory cuts in carbon
emissions. True to his word, President Clinton went on to sign the Kyoto
protocol, under which the U.S. was to pledge itself to reducing its
emissions 7% below 1990 levels by 2008, while developing countries would
not be required to cut back on their own emissions. His move sparked a
severe backlash in the U.S. Senate. The year before, at the initiative
of Democratic Senator Robert Byrd and his Republican colleague Chuck
Hagel, the Senate had passed Resolution 98 with unanimous support from
Republicans and Democrats, informing him that the Senate would not
consider ratification as long as developing countries were free to
pursue their economic development without having to lower their carbon
footprints. Senate Resolution 98 (1997) revolved mostly around concerns
about relative gains for emerging countries at the expense of the U.S.
to justify the refusal to endorse an agreement that "would result in
serious harm to the economy of the U.S." Four years later, the newly
elected Republican President, George W. Bush, formally announced that
the U.S. would not join the Kyoto protocol, also invoking the
unacceptable risk it posed to U.S. economic competitiveness. [The energy
policies implemented by the Obama administration also exemplify the
limitations imposed by concerns over economic growth on the ability of
the U.S. to exercise climate leadership. [While Barack Obama had pledged
himself to taking bold action on climate, his pres- idency saw a steep
rise in U.S. domestic production of natural gas and petroleum]{.mark},
thanks to extensive use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing
in regions like the Permian Basin and the Bakken formation, which had
begun in the mid-2000s]{.underline}. This crucial development quickly
turned the U.S. into the world's number one producer of oil and natural
gas. According to Yergin (2020, 26), this energy boom made possible
"America's manufacturing revival and its increased competitiveness in
the world economy." [Even though Barack Obama voiced his desire to exer-
cise climate leadership, [his administration was careful not to trammel
oil and gas production significantly]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the one
hand, he did impose regulations to address fugitive methane emissions
from natural gas extraction at the end of his second term, but, on the
other hand, he described natural gas as a necessary bridge fuel to a
decarbonized U.S. economy and left most of the task of regulating
fracking to state and local authorities. In 2015, he signed into law a
bipartisan Congressional compromise which lifted a ban on U.S. crude oil
exports dating back to the 1970s in return for extending tax credits for
the wind and solar industries notwithstanding opposition from
environmentalists (Yergin 2020, 55). In an effort to prove the bona
fides of the U.S. in the run up to COP21, the Obama administration opted
to predicate its climate policy on reducing the use of coal. It put
forward its Clean Power Plan, the aim of which was to use the
President's executive authority to regulate most coal-fired plants out
of existence. Because coal is the worst contributor to climate change
and because it has accounted for a large fraction of energy use in the
U.S. for more than a century, this could be seen as a way for the Obama
administration to exert climate leadership, by setting an important
example for countries such as India and China which still rely heavily
on this fuel. The Clean Power Plan, however, was never implemented
because it was put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 and was
later abandoned by the Trump administration. The Obama administration's
choice to focus on coal should give us pause because the coal industry
had already started to decline rapidly as a result of fierce competition
from cheap and abundant natural gas before Obama's election and has
continued to do so since, despite efforts by the Trump administration to
revive it. In other words, one may wonder if the center-piece of Barack
Obama's climate policy would have made a difference hadit been
implemented. This preference for low-hanging fruit as opposed to
potentially more destabilizing deep cuts is reminiscent of the Clinton
administration's insistence on the recognition of carbon sinks and its
demand that more flexible mechanisms be included in the Kyoto protocol
in the late 1990s (Aykut and Dahan 2015), which would have lowered the
economic burden of climate action on the U.S. economy, while making its
impact more limited. Such stances align with realist expectations that
great powers will protect their economic capabilities jealously. The way
the Biden administration will tackle shale gas production and fracking
will provide key indications as to the seriousness of its commit- ment
to substantial climate leadership. During its first year, the Biden
administration sent mixed messages. As Democrats seized all the levers
of power in Washington, they continued to tout their firm intention of
following through on their campaign pledges by adopting a three- pronged
strategy combining massive public investments in energy transition,
ambitious regulations and mandates, and an emphasis on climate change in
U.S. diplomatic dealings with the rest of the world. The Treasury
Department urged multilateral development banks to stop financing gas
exploration and production, while the administration promoted an
international pledge to cut global methane emissions by at least 30% by
2030. Given how much the U.S. economy has benefited from increased
natural gas output over the previous decade, promoting such an initia-
tive undeniably qualifies as a form of climate leadership on the part of
the Biden administration. However, the international framework needed to
make it a reality remains to be built, and other major emitters, such as
China, Russia, and India, have yet to endorse the initiative. As soon as
he became president, Joe Biden lost no time in pausing oil and gas
leasing on federal lands, but this move did not affect the many leases
on federal acreage which pre-dated his election, thus giving oil and gas
companies a lot of leeway to continue drilling on federal lands, let
alone on privately held ones where most natural gas extraction takes
place. [The Biden administration's unwillingness to discourage U.S.
liquefied natural gas exports offered another indication of its
ambivalence on this crucial issue. The energy crisis sparked by the
Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 prompted the Biden
administration to lower its short-term climate ambitions. In order to
rein in inflation at home and to help European countries wean themselves
off Russian gas, it took several steps indicating that [tackling climate
change]{.mark} urgently [no longer ranked as high on]{.mark} its
[agenda]{.mark} as in early 2021]{.underline}. In late March 2022, for
example, the Biden administration pressed oil and gas companies which
controlled leases on public lands to produce more oil and gas. It went
on to call for additional E.U. imports of about 50 billion cubic meters
of U.S. LNG annually until 2030 (Fact Sheet 2022). Whether these policy
options will be quickly discontinued remains to be seen. In more ways
than one, the Biden administration's climate proposal hinges on the
success of green growth, i.e. the ability of the U.S. economy to
decouple GDP growth from a rise in emissions. Absent such a decoupling,
it would have to choose between inadequate measures and degrowth. If
recent history is any guide, climate leadership from the U.S. or any
other nation is severely hampered by their unwillingness to go beyond
efforts whose economic repercussions will be modest. This is why,
despite lofty rhetoric at large climate gatherings, the policies put in
place to mitigate climate change are very often found wanting. For
example, Liu and Raftery (2021) have found that nations' formal pledges
under the Paris Accord would need to be 80% stronger than current plans
for them to be able to meet existing goals. A report from the UN
Environment Programme (2020) suggested that the Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs) put forward within the framework of the Paris
Accord would need to be made three times more ambitious for the world to
have a chance to meet the 2 °C target by 2100, and five times more
ambitious to meet the even more virtuous 1.5 °C target. Sachs (2019) has
argued that as deeper cuts become necessary, the appetite for climate
action may subside accordingly[. This does not necessarily mean that the
[U.S. government]{.mark} will show no interest in exercising climate
leadership, but its [willingness]{.mark} to do so is likely to be
[constrained by the short-term economic cost of substantial
action.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A Democratic president was in the White House. The Democratic Party held
a majority of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
But a single senator --- a moderate Democrat from West Virginia ---
blocked the White House's preferred climate plan. No, this wasn't 2021
--- the year was 1993: Jurassic Park had just been released, Bill
Clinton was president, and atmospheric carbon dioxide was only 357 parts
per million (it's 415 ppm today). Senator Robert Byrd of fossil-fuel
laden West Virginia was the chair of the Senate Appropriations
committee, and without his support, the Clinton administration couldn't
pass a tax on carbon emissions to address climate change. The White
House opted to support an energy tax instead, which passed the House
but, faced with substantial opposition and fossil-fuel lobbying, never
became law.

It was the first climate policy failure of many. Four years later, Byrd
spearheaded a resolution that prevented the U.S. from ratifying the
Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
[Other efforts to pass climate legislation stalled nearly every year
after. Indeed,]{.underline} [[the last three decades of U.S. climate
policy look like a graveyard of failed bills]{.underline}]{.mark}:
[Carbon taxes have died on the Senate floor and been torched by attack
ads. Cap-and-trade systems have been endorsed --- and then]{.underline}
[[abandoned]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[by Republicans and Democrats
alike]{.underline}]{.mark}. [According to the Climate Change Performance
Index, the [U.S. is 55th in the world]{.mark} when it comes to climate
policy; another analysis by Yale University and Columbia University
ranked the country 24th for environmental performance]{.underline}. Now,
as Democrats struggle to regroup after current West Virginia Senator Joe
Manchin's refusal to support President Joe Biden's landmark climate and
social welfare bill, it seems to be happening again. The U.S. is within
reach of passing climate policy, but perilously close to falling short.
Biden's giant climate bill --- known as the Build Back Better Act --- is
still in play. Democrats have vowed to try and pass it regardless of
Manchin's stance, while the West Virginia senator has said publicly that
the climate sections of the bill may be easier to reach agreement on
than, say, the Child Tax Credit. But earlier this week, Manchin also
claimed that there have been "no negotiations" about the bill. For the
moment, Build Back Better looks like a grim bookend to decades of
inaction on climate change[. So what's wrong with the U.S. political
system? Is [American democracy uniquely incapable of tackling global
warming]{.mark}? "In most countries around the world, it is extremely
difficult to pass climate reform," said Matto Mildenberger, a professor
of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
But, he added, there are a few things that make dealing with global
warming uniquely difficult in the United States; not impossible, but
very hard.]{.underline} In his book, *Carbon Captured*, Mildenberger
argues that the most difficult part about [passing climate policy is
that [fossil fuel]{.mark} interests enjoy something he calls "double
representation."]{.underline} That means that they are [[represented on
both the left]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[through labor unions and
industrial workers]{.underline}**, [[and on the
right]{.underline}]{.mark} **[through business interests]{.underline}**.
This "double representation" has been the death knell of climate
policies. That's because in most democracies, it's easier to block
change than to create it. And the United States government, with its
separation of powers baked into the Constitution, offers many more
opportunities for blocking than other democracies. "The United States
has a lot of what in political science are called '**[[veto
points]{.mark},]{.underline}**'" Mildenberger explained. "There's a lot
of different individuals in different places that [[can block a
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, all the way from having a majority in the
House of Representatives to having a really conservative Supreme Court."
Those "veto points" have been visible in many of the U.S.'s major
climate flops to date. [In 2009, a cap-and-trade bill, the centerpiece
of President Barack Obama's climate strategy, died [in the
Senate]{.mark} after it became clear that Democrats could not rustle up
60 "yes" votes to overcome the filibuster. (The filibuster: a veto
point.) Later, Obama's back-up plan --- an order to require utilities to
switch over to clean sources of electricity --- was challenged [in the
courts and]{.mark} never implemented. (The courts: another veto point.)
Then, [in]{.mark} 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he would
pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, even though
the treaty was non-binding. ([Executive action]{.mark}: yet another veto
point.) Every time climate advocates have tried to push through change,
the story has been distinctly American: veto point, veto point, veto
point. The U.S. electoral system doesn't help much either. The United
States has [a presidential system]{.mark}, rather than a parliamentary
system]{.underline} --- meaning that the president, or head of state,
does not necessarily belong to the same party as the majority of
Congress. [That [means]{.mark} two branches of government are often
pulling in different directions, [dooming bills]{.mark} to a no man's
land of inaction.]{.underline} Studies have shown that parliamentary
systems are generally quicker to establish climate-friendly policies:
Many [[parliamentary democracies like the United Kingdom, Japan, and
Germany have already managed to establish carbon prices or similar
carbon-cutting measures]{.underline}]{.mark}, but there are exceptions,
like the climate policy-averse Australia. Then there's the U.S.'s
single-member House districts which create Congresspeople more focused
on representing their geographical areas than toeing the party line.
Taken together, the system creates what Roger Karapin calls
"centrifugal" forces that separate and divide legislators. "We have 50
states, a huge territory, and a huge population," said Karapin, a
professor of political science at Hunter College, City University of New
York. "By their nature, members of Congress are appealing to their base
back home --- and those bases are far apart." Karapin says the makeup of
Congress tilts the country toward fossil fuel interests: Two senators
per state means that states dependent on oil and gas or coal have
disproportionate weight while less populous states gain outsized
representation in Congress. Several of those less populous states ---
Wyoming, Alaska, the Dakotas --- also have substantial fossil fuel
reserves. Combine those barriers with an extremely polarized political
system and a powerful fossil fuel industry that can use cash to
influence politicians, and the United States' idea of democracy doesn't
look like a great place to enact positive climate policies.

Technological optimism and climate isolationism

Recognizing the gendered realities of climate policy and climate
decision-making, this section reviews technological optimism and climate
isolationism to masculinity. Since the 1980s and 1990s, when climate
change first emerged as a global challenge, leading voices advocating
for action focused on the need to invest in understanding better the
science of climate change and in technological innovation to reduce the
impacts (Stephens & Markusson, 2018). [Technological optimism has
distorted climate policy and climate action in countries throughout the
world because the [science and engineering focus has dominated climate
discourse]{.mark} (Stephens, 2009]{.underline}). Review of the history
of climate action in the United States demonstrates that [the [US has
been a climate technology leader but a climate policy
laggard]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stephens, 2009). A major [[consequence of
this masculine technological optimism has been climate
isolationism]{.mark}. Climate isolationism refers to the narrow
technocratic lens that is prevalent in patriarchal decision-making
around both climate mitigation and climate adaptation]{.underline}. When
climate isolationism is applied to climate mitigation, decarbonization
is usually the goal (Geels et al., 2017), carbon accounting is the
primary metric, and incentives and costs of a variety of different
mitigating technologies are often projected and compared (Auel &
Cassady, 2016). [When [climate isolationism is]{.mark} applied to
climate adaptation, a [disproportionate focus on investing in technical
infrastructure]{.mark} (i.e., sea walls [and]{.mark} drought-resistant
crops) often [detracts]{.mark} attention and [investment from social
innovation]{.mark} and social changes [that could enhance climate
resilience]{.mark} (Rodima-Taylor et al., 2012).]{.underline} The
narrowness of climate isolationism results in limited opportunities for
people to connect and engage (Peterson et al., 2015). [The technocratic
focus limits public discourse because it excludes people for whom these
abstract, scientific terms, or the technological details may not be
meaningful and it makes the challenge seem distant and unapproachable
(Stephens, 2020). Not only does [this very technical way of discussing
climate change]{.mark} resonate with only a small subgroup of society,
it also often [projects the need for sacrifice]{.mark} and hardship
[rather than highlighting]{.mark} benefits and [opportunities]{.mark}
(Peeters et al., 2019).]{.underline} Climate isolationism is also
exclusive because many proposed technological "solutions" are also
expensive and perceived as options that are only accessible to the rich
(Biermann & Möller, 2019). Driving a Tesla electric vehicle, for
example, is not an option for most people, so the focus on this
technological innovation results in many people feeling disempowered and
disengaged (Stephens & Surprise, 2020). [This disempowerment is
compounded by [science and engineering being fields that continue to be
dominated by white men]{.mark} (Woolston, 2020). Despite efforts to
diversify science and engineering, [persistent racial, gendered, and
economic injustices]{.mark} of our economy and our educational systems
[perpetuate exclusive access to science and engineering]{.mark}
(Valantine & Collins, 2015)]{.underline}. Participating in science
continues to be a selective activity only accessible to a privileged few
(Lee, 2016). [The [lack of diversity]{.mark} within the fields of
science and engineering limits the scope of inquiry and
[constrains]{.mark} the types of connections that are made among
[science, technology, and society]{.mark} (Stephens, 2020).]{.underline}
As we move to incorporate innovative responses that promote social
justice to climate change beyond technological justifications for energy
transformation, there is a need to include other kinds of expertise,
experiences, and perspectives. [The technical focus of [climate
isolationism]{.mark} also obfuscates and **[diminishes the potential for
transformative social change]{.mark}** (Anderson & Peters, 2016) and it
limits the possibilities for investing in social innovation, social
infrastructure, and social justice (Stephens, 2020).]{.underline} When
the climate crisis is framed as a scientific problem with a possible
technological fix, the systemic societal and economic problems,
including the concentration of wealth and power among those profiting
from maintaining fossil fuel reliance, are all-too-often ignored
(Stephens, 2020). The prevalence of climate isolationism has encouraged
too many leaders to be blind to the important opportunities for
[improving people\'s lives and strengthening communities as we
transition away from a society reliant on fossil fuels (Stephens,
2019).]{.underline} [The narrow technocratic approach of [climate
isolationism]{.mark} has not only been ineffective in mobilizing
transformative change but it [has]{.mark} also [resulted in
climate]{.mark} and energy programs and [policies that exacerbate
inequities and perpetuate injustice]{.mark} (Jenkins et al., 2020).
Because the social dimensions of climate and energy have not been
adequately considered, [we have ended up with policies that]{.mark}
further exclude and **[disadvantage low-income communities, women, and
communities of color]{.mark}** (Reames, 2016)]{.underline}. The
quantitative technocratic tendency of climate isolationism reinforces a
dubious technological optimism (Basiago, 1994), which has led to growing
interest and funding for technological fixes to the climate crisis
(Stephens & Markusson, 2018).While technology is an essential part of a
transition toward a more just, equitable, and climate-stable future[,
investments in science and technology have not yet been balanced with
investments in social science, social infrastructure, social
innovations, and social justice. This [lack of investment in social
infrastructure]{.mark} and social innovations [has weakened our social
ties and reduced our societal resilience]{.mark} (Aldrich,
2012)]{.underline}. For decades, strategic governmental responses to the
climate crisis have been focused almost exclusively on investments in
science and technology (Stephens, 2009), while very little has been
invested in social innovation.By focusing almost exclusively on
technological innovation, climate isolationism obfuscates the potential
for transformative social change and diminishes the priority of
investing in climate-resilient innovations that simultaneously advance
social justice (Jenkins, 2018). [The persistence of the narrow [climate
isolationism]{.mark} perspective [has been beneficial for the polluter
elite]{.mark}, those wealthy individuals and organizations that do not
want transformative change because they are [profiting from fossil fuel
reliance]{.mark} and exploitative corporate business practices (Kenner,
2019).]{.underline} Climate denialism, which has been supported by
fossil fuel interests and the polluter elite, has also required climate
decision-makers to spend a lot of time and energy defending what is
known about the science of climate change (Oreskes, 2019). The polluter
elite\'s decades-long strategic misinformation campaign to confuse the
public about the science of climate change has been an effective delay
tactic (Frumhoff et al., 2015). [The prevalence of climate denialism has
confined climate discourse to the scientific realm and limited options
for nonscientific discourse about how to respond to the climate crisis
and reduce climate vulnerabilities.]{.underline} Continuing to increase
investment in technological innovation while underinvesting in social
innovation is preventing the transformative changes that are required
both for stabilizing the climate and for reducing social injustice. So
not only does climate isolationism result in missed opportunities to
advance social and economic justice, but it also results in insufficient
environmental protection (Jenkins, 2018).

Feminist, antiracist values

This final section provides [[a transformative alternative to the
ineffective and dangerous masculine technological
optimism]{.underline}]{.mark}. [To counter and resist the perpetuation
of masculine technological optimism and climate isolationism, [feminist,
antiracist values need be prioritized in climate and energy
policy]{.mark}. Feminist, antiracist values involve constant
consideration of power dynamics, that is, [paying attention to who has
power and privilege, who is being excluded or marginalized]{.mark}, what
legacy processes and priorities are perpetuating discrepancies in power,
and ultimately whether and how power is being concentrated or
distributed (Stephens, 2020).]{.underline} Vigilant and transparent
analysis and assessment of power, including understanding the multiple
ways that social, economic, and political power shape institutions and
social change (Kashwan et al., 2019), are fundamental to the
transformations that are needed for a more just, equitable, healthy and
prosperous future. Recognizing that social change and innovation can
disrupt or reinforce existing and legacy power dynamics, explicit and
continuous attention to different forms of empowerment and
disempowerment are critically important (Avelino, 2021). [Given the
disruptive time and the human suffering exacerbated by the pandemic and
the climate crisis, [elevating feminist, antiracist values is a
central]{.mark} priority for societal transformation.]{.underline} To
understand the term "antiracist," Ibram X. Kendi\'s powerful 2019 book
How to Be an Antiracist provides guidance. In his book, Kendi explains
that anyone who declares that they are not racist is signifying
neutrality, but, he points out, in the struggle with racism there is no
neutrality (2019). Kendi explains that [[the opposite of "racist" is not
"not racist" but it is "antiracist"---whenever we ignore issues of race
we are inadvertently perpetuating racism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the
deep legacy of racial injustice embedded in our culture, in our
institutions, in our communities, in our economy, and in our policies,
those who do not actively resist racism are in fact supporting it.
[Embracing antiracist values requires continual recognition and active
resistance to racism in all its many legacy forms and structures. A
similar argument can be made regarding feminist values which are
consistently resisting the power of patriarchy, misogyny, and gender
discrimination (Manne, 2018). Like racism, sexism is deeply rooted in
our society, and many of our institutions, norms, and values will
continue to reinforce gender discrimination unless we are continually
and actively resisting. **[Unless we are actively resisting racism and
patriarchy we are actually perpetuating these systems of
oppression]{.mark}**.]{.underline} According to Chimamanda Ngozi
Adichie, author of We Should All be Feminists, many men say that they do
not think much about gender or notice gender disparities (Adichie,
2012). Similarly, many white people say that they do not think much
about race or notice racial disparities. [[Those with privilege]{.mark}
who consider themselves successful within current systems [are]{.mark}
generally [less aware of]{.mark} the [structural oppression]{.mark} that
stratifies society.]{.underline} This is why feminist antiracist values
are so critical in society\'s efforts to confront the interconnected
crises facing humanity. **[[If society\'s response to the climate crisis
is based on proposals from those who are]{.mark} unaware of or
[indifferent to racism and sexism, climate action is almost guaranteed
to reinforce those inequities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[And]{.mark}, if
antiracist and feminist values are not prioritized, [society is unlikely
to succeed in designing]{.mark} inclusive and effective [responses to
the climate crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is important to note that
anyone can embrace antiracist and feminist values. Every human being has
the capacity to learn, understand and have empathy for other human
beings, so all of us can resist systems of oppression regardless of
where we are positioned within those systems. Ultimately, everyone is
negatively impacted by racism, misogyny, and other forms of oppression.
So everyone, regardless of gender, race, or any other identities, can be
encouraged to embrace and prioritize feminist, antiracist values. [To
move mainstream climate decision-making beyond climate isolationism
toward climate justice, it is helpful to understand how climate
isolationism is being perpetuated and why a gender lens is so important
in advancing climate justice and resisting climate
isolationism]{.underline}. The prevalence of climate isolationism can be
attributed to multiple factors including the limited experiences and
perspectives of many climate experts whose knowledge is limited to
climate science and technology. [[White men have made up the majority of
climate and energy experts]{.mark} (Kempe, 2021[), and]{.mark} the
systemic [exclusion]{.mark} of diverse voices in mainstream climate
decision-making has [contributed to climate isolationism]{.mark}
(Stephens & Surprise, 2020).]{.underline} Since the climate crisis was
first recognized as an emerging problem in the late 1970s and early
1980s (Keeling et al., 1976, Marchetti, 1977, National Research Council,
1983), a [technocratic, reductionist, top-down approach to climate
policy has dominated]{.underline}. Large investments have been made in
technological innovations to mitigate climate change (Gallagher et al.,
2006, Holdren, 2006), but minimal attention has been given to social
innovation, power dynamics, and how climate and energy policy could
leverage change toward social justice (Webler & Tuler, 2010). One
prominent and influential privileged white man who has not embraced
climate justice but is instead perpetuating climate isolationism is Bill
Gates. His 2021 book "How to Avoid Climate Disaster" focuses exclusively
on technological innovations demonstrating the inadequacy and dangers of
climate isolationism (Gates, 2021). In this book, Gates openly
acknowledges that he does not "have a solution to the politics of
climate change." Rather he professes that new and existing technologies
can solve the climate crisis; all that is needed is more investment in
technological innovation to speed up the pace (Gates, 2021). Gates also
describes solar geoengineering as a "cutting edge, 'Break Glass in Case
of Emergency' kind of tool" that is valuable to have in case things get
so bad that there are few other options. He says "There may come a day
when we don't have a choice. Best to prepare for that day now." Gates
singular focus on technological innovation is [characteristic of climate
isolationism and represents a trend of privileged tech-savy men, the
so-called ["climate dudes"]{.mark} who [think they can swoop and solve
complex problem]{.mark}s that others have spent decades attempting to
address]{.underline} (Jones, 2021).The prevalence of climate
isolationism can also be attributed to a [male-dominated climate and
energy leadership that continues to prioritize scientific and
technological expertise to inform climate policy]{.underline} (Fraune,
2015, Pearl-Martinez & Stephens, 2016). Like many other aspects of
society, the science, politics, and economics of climate and energy have
been dominated by privileged white-male leadership which has tended to
[be technocratic, reductionist, patriarchal, and top-down]{.underline}
(Faber et al., 2017, Sorman et al., 2020). The technological optimism
that is characteristic of climate isolationism is also linked to
masculinity as the colloquial phrase "boys and their toys" represents
(Lohan & Faulkner, 2004).

Conclusions

To move beyond masculine technological optimism and climate isolationism
toward climate justice, [[climate decision-making has to embrace
feminist antiracist priorities]{.mark} by focusing more explicitly on
power dynamics and social innovations to redistribute power to people
and communities who are most vulnerable.]{.underline} Climate
decision-making needs to explicitly consider how policies, practices,
and priorities either reinforce or disrupt the systems that are
currently concentrating wealth and power. For less powerful groups to
gain a foothold in decision-making processes, renewed attention to the
multiple ways that social, economic, and political power shape social
change must be acknowledged (Kashwan et al., 2019). Feminist theory
offers expertise in the study of power (Bell et al., 2020), so embracing
[a feminist lens is one valuable approach to moving away from climate
isolationism toward climate justice.]{.underline} The social science
literature on sociotechnical transitions has been critiqued for
minimizing the role of power (Avelino, 2017), and a recent contribution
by Avelino (2021) identifies seven specific ways to consider power in
decision-making, processes of change, and innovation: (a) power over
versus power to, (b) centered versus diffused, (c) consensual versus
conflictual, (d) constraining versus enabling, (e) quantity versus
quality, (f) empowerment versus disempowerment, and (g) power in
relation to knowledge (Avelino, 2021). As jurisdictions around the world
grapple with the interconnected crises of housing and food insecurity,
climate disruptions, and economic precarity, narrow efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions or control the global average temperature are
likely to cause more harm than good. New ways of strategically
integrating climate action into other social policies, in the way that
the Biden/Harris administration is "quietly" integrating their climate
agenda in 2021 into pandemic recovery and infrastructure investments,
provides an empirical example of the practical valuable potential of
moving away from climate isolationism (Osaka, 2021). Mary Robinson and
many others too have recognized that the most powerful decision-makers
in climate and energy are "too male, too pale, and too stale." [[There
is an underrepresentation of women in energy and climate

### AT: US leadership Key

#### Leadership framing is flawed -- The aff treats policy as zero sum locks in climate change.

The business of climate change negotiation can usefully be analysed in
terms of game theory, following the work of the Princeton economist John
Nash, who developed the theory of so-called 'non- cooperative games'.
[This theory demonstrated how [a 'game' such as a climate change
negotiation could result in a stable, sub-optimal equilibrium]{.mark} in
which no single player can benefit from unilaterally changing his or her
move.]{.underline} Nash proved that sub-optimaloutcomes could arise in a
much wider set of games than previously thought, in particular those
involving many players. [This phenomenon is clearly encountered in
climate change negotiations that attempt to set emission-reduction
goals.]{.underline} The idea is that negotiation targets are carved up
between different parties in order to achieve a global goal. This
automatically creates a situation where countries will tend towards the
Nash equilibrium -- [[no one country will benefit by changing its
approach while the other players keep their strategies
unchanged]{.mark}. So long as each party refuses to give ground[, the
equilibrium will be perpetuated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Climate change
leaders have attempted to breakaway from this zero-sum-game mentality by
committing also to regional-level actions outside the international
negotiations. The rationale is that taking unilateral action creates the
potential for everyone to benefit. The European Union's 20% reduction
target is one such example[. This target was agreed on the understanding
that the future lies in the development of a low- or even zero-carbon
economy, and a belief that all countries will want to travel down this
path eventually, so it is constructive for one party -- Europe in this
case -- to be at the forefront]{.underline}. Central to this approach is
a concept that is fundamental to climate leadership -- interdependency.
This is explored in detail in the analysis of 'Europe in the World' by
Burke and Mabey. Their analysis recognizes that 'the determinants of
Europe's peace and prosperity no longer lie predominantly within its
geographical borders. We cannot make a transition to sustainable
development on our own.' By understanding, and taking account of,
interdependence, it becomes possible to make decisions that will benefit
not only Europe but also the rest of the world. [According to this
reasoning, this will enable [Europe]{.mark} to [move towards a
collaborative approach]{.mark}, and seek ways of working with other
nations on energy and climate security [to achieve mutual
interests]{.mark}. [This contrasts markedly to the approach of the
US]{.mark} administration, [which has prevaricated over]{.mark} emission
reduction [targets]{.mark} (since withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol in
2001) [out of a fear of damaging US international
competitiveness]{.mark}, not least [vis-à-vis China]{.mark}, with
attendant job losses.]{.underline} However, Krugman and others have
argued that the concept of competitiveness has little meaning at the
level of the nation-state. The argument carries serious weight only at
the level of the firm or sector, where it is possible to identify
winners and losers. Krugman argues that at the level of the nation-state
it is more appropriate to focus on productivity. In the context of
climate change, this includes the potential for the global carbon market
-- valued at \$30 billion in 200633-- to create new business
opportunities that will contribute to national growth[. Nevertheless,
the reluctance of the US administration to commit to a binding 50%
reduction target at the G8 summit on 7 June demonstrates that [the US
administration is]{.mark} still unconvinced about the overall potential
benefits of the carbon market to the US economy and [wary about handing
over a competitive advantage to China and India.]{.mark} There is still
more work to be done by climate leaders [to break down the zero-sum-game
mentality]{.mark}.]{.underline}

History shows that world orders, disorders or new orders often result
from the disturbing dynamics unleashed by crises amid the rise of new
powers and the resistance of existing powers. Current dynamics can be
understood by analyzing how the world order is transitioning from a
state of hegemony to one of "intertwined hegemony". Hegemony is a
concept that was employed by Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci
and is applied in international relations to describe the enduring
aspects of an existing order maintained by a leading actor through a
skillful combination of coercive and non-coercive power. Hegemony is
often associated with the United States, which has served as the primary
hegemon shaping the post-war order. [[US]{.mark} [heg]{.mark}emony has
been [exerted through]{.mark} its [econ]{.mark}omic [and
military]{.mark} power, [as well as]{.mark} through [international
institutions]{.mark} used as tools to uphold global norms, trade and
security structures.]{.underline} [[However]{.mark}, since September 11
and the 2008 global financial crisis, the [world]{.mark} order has
[undergone]{.mark} multiple [crises]{.mark} and pivotal moments, such as
[China's rise]{.mark}, the [US-China rivalry]{.mark}, the
Russia-[Ukraine war, China's]{.mark} increasing [role in the Middle
East,]{.mark} Israel's latest assault in [Palestine]{.mark} and Donald
[Trump's second term.]{.mark} These [crises]{.mark} and pivotal moments
have [exposed]{.mark} [vulnerabilities in]{.mark} the existing [world
order]{.mark} and challenged the hegemony of Western-led institutions
and norms.]{.underline} [The existing world order is facing crises
across four key domains. Multilateral cooperation is increasingly
elusive due to great power rivalries and interstate conflicts,
highlighting a crisis of functionality as global institutions
[struggle]{.mark} to build [consensus]{.mark} on critical issues, such
as [climate change, pandemics and cybersecurity]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The [US-led]{.mark} "rules-based" global [governance]{.mark}
architecture has [shown]{.mark} its [inability to]{.mark} effectively
[address]{.mark} [worldwide challenges]{.mark}. The [failure to
deliver]{.mark} a secure and [equitable]{.mark} global [system
underscores a crisis of legitimacy.]{.mark} Finally, [shifting power
dynamics]{.mark} between emerging and established powers signifies a
[crisis of authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this context, intertwined
hegemony is a better way to describe the transition from the current
world order to an emerging one. [[Intertwined heg]{.mark}emony reflects
a [process defined by mutual challenges, constraints,
dependencies]{.mark} and [accommodation between]{.mark} existing and
emerging [powers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Defenders and challengers of the
existing order are deeply intertwined. [Firstly, intertwined hegemony
indicates that globalization is [steering the world]{.mark} economy
[towards]{.mark} an era of multiple development models characterized by
the coexistence of multiple [competing economic systems and modes of
governance]{.mark}. Global economic players now include not only private
entities but also states, exemplified by Chinese state-owned
enterprises.]{.underline} The Chinese development model, often referred
to as the Beijing Consensus -- understood as regulated state-market -
society relations -- stands in contrast to the US-led Washington
Consensus defined by liberal economic policies. Non-state entities like
transnational corporations, tech giants and social movements also play
an outsize role in shaping the world order. Secondly, intertwined
hegemony reflects a shift towards a post-hegemonic world, where no
single power, like the US or the West more broadly, unilaterally shapes
global norms or leadership. Decentralized platforms, internet
connections, the digital economy and tech competition have eroded
traditional monopolies on discourse, narratives and soft power. Global
norms are becoming more flexible and less universal, while alliances
form around specific challenges and interests rather than shared
ideologies. In this post-hegemonic era, no single power can enforce
global order, raising the risk of regional conflicts and power
rivalries. Thirdly, intertwined hegemony emphasizes the diverse
perspectives on mechanisms, policies and strategies that drive national
development and growth. [Today, [emerging powers]{.mark} have the
capacity to [formulate]{.mark} collective [positioning
strategies]{.mark} and balancing tactics [in the global arena.]{.mark}
For example, the expansion of [BRICS promotes]{.mark} a more
[inclusive]{.mark} [model of]{.mark} global [governance]{.mark} that
values cultural and civilizational diversity, providing an [alternative
to the universalism]{.mark} often espoused by the West.]{.underline} The
expansion of the BRICS grouping indicates emerging powers are navigating
the evolving world order through a selective interplay of strategies,
including watching or observing developments, actively engaging in
global affairs, and influencing the world system to align with their
interests. Last but not least, intertwined hegemony marks a new era in
which stratification between nations in the traditional core,
semi-periphery and periphery, as well as the conventional North-South
axis, may no longer fully capture the complexities of today's globalized
and interconnected world. While they remain useful for understanding
global inequality and historical patterns of exploitation, the rise of
emerging economies like China has reshaped the established structure of
global economic stratification. This is not the first time the world
order has encountered a post-hegemonic reality. Historical transitions,
such as the period following the fall of the Roman Empire and the
interwar years between the first and second world wars, experienced
similar phases of uncertainty and transformation. The unprecedented pace
of technological, economic and environmental changes are key
distinctions in today's world. [[Whether these transformations lead to a
new equilibrium or devolve into chaos depends]{.mark} largely [on
how]{.mark} global [actors address]{.mark} and navigate these
[challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, intertwined hegemony is
perhaps the best way to describe evolving global dynamics, where power
and influence are increasingly shared, contested and co-produced across
different regions and actors. The emerging world order characterized by
intertwined hegemony embodies a duality. As existing powers gradually
lose their dominance, emerging powers have yet to establish an
alternative hegemony grounded in universal principles and norms.

#### Clinging to dominance ensures nuclear war, econ collapse, and arms racing. 

Chris **Wright 23,** professor of history at the City University of New
York, Ph.D., 4/28/2023, \"The Second Cold War Is More Dangerous than the
First,\"
https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/04/28/the-second-cold-war-is-more-dangerous-than-the-first/

[Modern history shows that [the most dangerous periods are when two or
more great powers are struggling for heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}. The
eighteenth century in Europe was a time of "multipolarity," as Britain,
France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia were almost continually at war,
competing for geopolitical advantage and to divide the continent between
them. The conflicts escalated in the era of the French Revolution and
Napoleonic Wars, as a mighty France, bursting with revolutionary energy,
strove for absolute dominance against, in the end, Britain and Russia.
The 1815 Congress of Vienna led to a century-long balance of power
presided over by an industrializing Britain, which soon became the
supreme world power. Once industrialization swept the rest of Europe,
however, particularly Germany, Britain's power began to be challenged,
not only in the Scramble for Africa but in Europe itself. German elites
wanted their country to be the next Britain, and to a great extent it
was their desire for hegemony that precipitated both world wars. [Since
1945, the United States has been virtually a global
hegemon.]{.underline} As John Ross notes in the recently published
Washington's New Cold War, even at the height of its relative economic
achievement in the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union's GDP was only 44 percent
of the U.S.'s. The Soviets had vast power in their limited sphere
encompassing Eastern Europe and Central Asia, but they were not a
capitalistically expansive, dynamically growing imperial power in the
mode of the United States---or, more recently, of a resurgent China.
China's GDP is 74 percent of the U.S.'s, and its growth rate is higher
(it has grown seven times faster than the American economy since 2007).
Measured by purchasing power parities, the U.S. accounts for only 16
percent of the world economy, and China's economy is 18 percent larger.
[In short, for [the first time since World War]{.mark} II, we [are
entering]{.mark} an [era of real]{.mark} [competition]{.mark} between
two mammoth economies, a [declining]{.mark} hegemon [and]{.mark} an
[aspiring hegemon]{.mark}. When people talk about "the China threat,"
this is, in effect, all they mean. In the long run, [China]{.mark} poses
a greater threat to U.S. power than the Soviet Union ever
did.]{.underline} Mainstream commentators and politicians prate about
China's threat to democratic values and human rights---there always has
to be an ideological rationalization for geopolitical strategy---but
U.S. foreign and domestic policy since the Second World War tells us how
much its elites care about democracy and human rights. From the Vietnam
War to the catastrophic invasion of Iraq, and from U.S. support for
thugs like Batista, Diem, Iran's Shah, Suharto, Duvalier, Trujillo,
Somoza, Pinochet, Marcos, Rios Montt, Mobutu, Saddam Hussein, Mubarak,
Sisi, Modi, Mohammed bin Salman, and Netanyahu to CIA coups and
attempted coups against countless governments, it is self-evident that
policymakers care little about the moral values they pretend to
espouse[. Americans have to ask themselves: [is]{.mark} [it]{.mark}
[worth]{.mark} [risking]{.mark} [nuclear]{.mark}
[war]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} an apocalyptic [nuclear]{.mark}
[winter]{.mark}---for no loftier purpose than [to]{.mark}
[maintain]{.mark} their country's violently enforced grasp of
overwhelming [global]{.mark} [power]{.mark}? [Threats]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [U.S]{.mark}. [Power]{.mark} The current flashpoint, of
course[, is the war in Ukraine]{.mark}, which is helping to [midwife a
"partnership" between China and Russia]{.mark}, both of which are also
deepening their ties with [Iran]{.mark}.]{.underline} Decades ago,
Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote that ["a [coalition]{.mark} allying Russia
with both China and Iran can [develop]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [if]{.mark}
[the United States]{.mark} is shortsighted enough to [antagonize China
and Iran]{.mark} simultaneously."]{.underline} He would presumably not
be very happy with U.S. policies that are bringing about exactly this
coalition. [At the same time, U.S. [missteps in the Middle East]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} its relative [disengagement]{.mark} from the region since
the Obama presidency are [allowing]{.mark} [China]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[improve]{.mark} [its]{.mark} [position]{.mark} there, as illustrated by
the [deal]{.mark} it recently brokered [between]{.mark} [Iran]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia to normalize relations]{.underline}.
China's burgeoning economic interests not only in the Middle East but
across most of the world, a function of its colossal, globe-spanning
Belt and Road Initiative, require the country to play an ever-greater
diplomatic role in fraught regions. Saudi Arabia, for its part, has
shown it is happy to defy Washington, even joining much of the world in
disregarding Western sanctions on Russia. While Washington's failure to
convince most countries to economically and diplomatically isolate
Russia highlights the U.S.'s declining "hegemony," the real threats to
American power run deeper than diplomatic embarrassments. [In coming
years, the very [status of the dollar as the world's dominant currency
may be threatened]{.mark}.]{.underline} A kind of "de-dollarization" has
been happening for some time now, as, for example, the share of dollar
reserves held by central banks declined from 71 percent in 1999 to 59
percent in 2021. [But in the last few years, and especially [since
Russia's invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine[, the ongoing effort by many
countries to undermine the dollar's dominance]{.mark} of the global
financial system has [intensified]{.mark}. In part, this is
[because]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [U.S.'s "weaponization" of the
dollar:]{.mark} in the recent past, [Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Afghanistan,
and Russia]{.mark} have [all suffered]{.mark} [from]{.mark} financial
and trade [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} that have included even
freezing overseas assets and removal from the SWIFT messaging system
that underpins the world's financial infrastructure. Other countries,
understandably worried about suffering the same fate, share Russia's
interest in developing new financial institutions and networks outside
of the U.S.-led system. Apart from this motivation, they simply want to
reduce their exposure to the effects of U.S. economic and monetary
policy, which can devastate economies. And as China rises, it makes
sense for it to promote use of the renminbi, or at least non-dollar
currencies. To that end, the BRICS countries, for instance, have been
establishing new institutions and market mechanisms to bypass the
dollar, and are even exploring the possibility of creating a new reserve
currency based on the BRICS basket of currencies. Institutions like the
New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, new payment
infrastructures that are alternatives to SWIFT, central bank digital
currencies, bilateral trade conducted in currencies other than the
dollar, and a renminbi oil futures market to partially de-dollarize the
global oil trade all point toward a future currency regime that is at
least multilateral, if not bilateral. [The economist Nouriel Roubini
argues that, "[in a world that will be]{.mark} increasingly [divided
into two]{.mark} [geopolitical spheres]{.mark} of influence," [a
bilateral currency regime is likely to emerge]{.mark}, perhaps in the
next decade]{.underline}. Given that "the dollar's dominant position in
the global financial system \[is\] the very foundation of \[the U.S.'s\]
global leadership," as two experts note, Washington can hardly be
viewing all these developments with equanimity[. [Loss of the dollar's
status]{.underline}]{.mark} [as the world's reserve currency would have
severe [consequences for the American economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But
this outcome is exactly the [end-goal of Washington's]{.mark} bellicose
[policies toward]{.mark} its perceived [rivals]{.mark}! Through
[economic sanctions and aggressive military]{.mark} actions---[expanding
NATO]{.mark} to Russia's borders and [encircling China with U.S. bases,
military]{.mark} forces, and [militarized partner states]{.mark} like
Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and even Taiwan---the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is driving]{.mark} into existence [a
hostile bloc of great]{.mark} powers [and medium-sized powers]{.mark}
that are necessarily committed to its defeat. Their policies, then, will
[become increasingly belligerent]{.mark}, which will serve to justify
even more belligerent U.S. policies, in a [vicious circle]{.mark} that
amounts [to]{.mark} an extraordinarily dangerous ["hybrid war" and arms
race.]{.mark}]{.underline}

OUP cemented the bipartisan adoption of this neoliberal economic and
foreign policy agenda, already begun by Clinton Administration's
expansions of NATO, along the dictates of the neoconservatives, as
explained by Wesley Clark and featured in the front matter of this
study[.]{.underline} As noted in the introduction, the deceptive
execution of OUP that blatantly exceeded the [mandate of UNSCR 1973
accelerated the [decline of the United States' unipolar heg]{.mark}emony
[into an ongoing de-hegemonic cyclical
feedback-loop]{.mark}]{.underline} which Wallerstein predicted and [the
[United States now]{.mark} finds itself stuck in, currently [thrashed
between two rocks in Ukraine and the Middle East]{.mark} at time of
writing in 2024.]{.underline}137As Glenn Diesen details this
self-defeating phenomenon[, "[Hegemony]{.mark} tends to become
[unsustainable]{.mark} as the [costs of an empire become
unaffordable]{.mark} and its [legitimacy collapses.]{.mark} [The liberal
hegemonic order had]{.mark} predictable [problems]{.mark}. Preserving
[unipolarity exhausted U.S. economic resources, challenged the norms of
state sovereignty, and]{.mark} the [reli]{.mark}ance [on
coercion]{.mark} undermined legitimacy."]{.underline}138 The ways the
neoliberal economic agenda (as well as neoliberal international
relations (IR) theory) fit hand-in-glove with the neoconservative's
militant interventionism will be examined below. The dictates of
neoliberal IR theory should not be taken at face value, much as the
previous examination of 138 Diesen, "Decline of the West and the Liberal
Order," epub. 137 Wallerstein, World-Systems Analysis, 58-59. 136
Campbell, Global NATO, 40. 50 neoliberal economics demonstrated it
should not be. However it is useful to examine the function of
Euro-centric academia which offers intellectualized justifications for
the abuses of the state in general rather than Libya and OUP in
particular (which works on OUP and Libya specifically are examined at
length below).139 [The ideological [promises of democratization, liberal
values, and economic gains]{.mark} [offered]{.mark} by neoliberal
doctrine, summarized euphemistically as 'the freer the market the freer
the people,[' cannot be taken seriously.]{.mark}]{.underline} As noted
by Harvey, data driven works by Gerard Dumenil and Dominique Levy
conclude neoliberalism "was from the very beginning a project to achieve
the restoration of class power."140 The ideological promises instead
simply serve as rhetorical justifications for whatever means necessary
to achieve the restoration of elite power, and should not be mistaken as
genuine motivations or intended consequences of neoliberalism.141
Adapting the function of Dumenil and Levy's conception of the neoliberal
economic rhetorical justification to the IR theory lends it a stricter
coherence to reality. Neoliberal IR theorists promote the
liberal-democratic state as the best fundamental baseline unit of the
international system, in which anarchy is 141 Harvey, A Brief History of
Neoliberalism, 16. 140 Harvey, A Brief History of Neoliberalism, 16. 139
Campbell, Global NATO, 141-153. As Horace Campbell notes, these
intellectual exercises and justifications are a form of narrative
control or information warfare (or even a psychological operation)
intended for the pan-European audience, as Africans and the previously
colonized people of the world are likely to reflexively reject these
assertions on the basis of their own historical experiences. 51 inherent
and the state acts as a rational agent that maximizes its interests in
the international arena- adapting the capitalist doctrine of individuals
as rational self-interest maximizing agents in the marketplace to the
state.142 [These [theorists]{.mark} [suppose]{.mark} the
[lib]{.mark}eral-[dem]{.mark}ocratic [state is the most cooperative and
least likely to wage war]{.mark} since its leaders are supposedly
accountable to the population and human rights are
respected]{.underline}.143 It is believed that cooperation amongst
states, and the creation of international institutions that foster
economic interdependence (in other words, institutions that foster the
processes of globalization) can replace the anarchy of the international
system with order. 144 Thus, the spread of liberal-democracy and
neoliberal economic institutions is seen as a win-win towards creating a
sustained peace and mutual economic benefits according to the neoliberal
IR theory. 145 [Further highlighting [an innate interventionist
tendency,]{.mark} the [neoliberal order favors a hegemonic power]{.mark}
able to supplant the natural balance of power between competing states,
like that of the [United States]{.mark} in its [pursuit]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [full spectrum dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}[146
In such a system the [paradoxical incentives]{.mark} for the supposedly
peaceful neoliberal states [to enact]{.mark} [further interventionist
measures abroad to create]{.mark} similar [neoliberal
liberal-democracies]{.mark} is clear]{.underline}. [The realist school
considers the balance of power between competing states as a deterrent
to conflict, while the neoliberals consider the balance of power
competition a hurdle to international cooperation that bolsters
authoritarian regimes ([ironic considering the United States' proclivity
to install authoritarian client regimes]{.mark} across the
globe).]{.underline}147 Functionally, neoliberal IR theory greases the
tracks for Western interventionist policy motivated by neoliberal
economics. Synthesizing neoliberal IR theory with Harvey, Dumenil, and
Levy's commentary on the function of the rhetoric of neoliberal
economics, and if the given humanitarian motivations of neoliberal IR
theory are assumed to be shallow rhetorical justifications for the
consolidation of the economic elite's wealth and power, then neoliberal
IR theory becomes ideologically coherent with reality. 148 In this
formulation war and conflict is understood as the product and tool of
neoliberal capitalist elites motivated to force states into an
interlinked global network of neoliberal trade relationships[.
[Democratic and humanitarian concerns]{.mark} can be [waived off]{.mark}
and the spoils of the economic system are filtered up to the elites.
Once illuminated in this way[, international integration into]{.mark}
the neoliberal network of trade, or [globalization]{.mark}, is
[not]{.mark} as [benevolent]{.mark} a concept as the win-win economic
integration the neoliberal IR theorists suggest]{.underline}.149

core-periphery relationship. [[The 'well-intentioned' aspects of
neoliberal theory]{.mark} function as an ideological cover, in [the
same]{.mark} fashion humanitarian rhetoric given as [justification

Short-run Futures

[By short-run futures we mean configurations that are likely to emerge
in the next 25 years---from 2025 to 2050.^23^ Although there are
[important similarities between]{.mark} the late-19th-century and
early-20th-century [decline of the British hegemony]{.mark} with what is
happening with US decline, there are also important differences. One
[similarity is the **arrival of a multipolar configuration**]{.mark} of
power among the most powerful states, a configuration that, in the past,
has led to interimperial rivalries and hot wars among core states. An
important [difference]{.mark} is [between]{.mark} an interstate system
that is configured [as a set of sovereign nation-states rather
than]{.mark} as a set of [colonial empires,]{.mark} a more developed set
of [**multilateral governmental institutions**,]{.mark} a [more
**globalized structure of production**]{.mark} and class relations,
hugely [increased long-distance transportation and
comm]{.mark}unications infrastructure, the evolution of military
technology to include much [more]{.mark} lethal and [destructive
weapons]{.mark}, and the expansion of the arenas of power projection
that have added airpower, space power, and cyberwarfare to the older
land and sea power theaters.]{.underline} The answer to the question
about the future of great power war is likely to be influenced by all
these differences.¶ Inflection Points and Great Power War¶ Heim and
Miller (2020) used a modified version of the Pardee GPI to model future
changes in the relative distribution of power using a baseline model
that does not include international conflict to examine what differences
population explosion, a lost decade of Chinese economic growth, or
different degrees and speed of onset of global warming would make for
the relative power shares of national-states. They also employed Charles
Doran's (2012) version of power transition theory to try to predict when
the risk of war between the United States and the P.R.C. would be
highest. All the models of power transition imply that when a rising
power gets close to, or passes, the relative power of the old hegemon
the risk of war is high. But Doran's version sees other inflection
points when the rates of change increase or decrease. This produces
confusion and uncertainty and makes it difficult for decision-makers to
be clear about what is happening. And Doran contends that when several
of the great powers (core states) go through inflection points in the
same short period the risk of warfare is higher. The most obvious
inflection point in Figure 6 is around 2040 when China's GPI score is
likely to pass the United States. But when we track economic and
military power shares separately, as in Figure 5, we can see that it
will probably take China longer to catch up with the US military share
level than the US economic power share level. The risk of war is
probably more influenced by military inflection points, and this implies
that the dangerous period might not arrive until the 2050s. The uneven
onset of global warming and climate change disasters will probably alter
the probabilities regarding which configurations of global power emerge
in the next several decades. The Heim and Miller model of the GPI tried
different levels of temperature increase and models of which regions are
likely to be affected the most. The global warming scenarios show that
China will see a significant increase in global power relative to the
baseline model, Russia will see a slight gain and the United States and
India will experience moderate declines (Heim and Miller 2020: Figure
19, p.20; Figure 21, p.21).¶ Thompson's (2022) book on the decline of US
systemic leadership uses the power cycle theoretical research program
that he developed with George Modelski to update their estimates of
shares of long-distance military power projection (see also Lee and
Thompson, 2018) and to ponder the short-run future of the global power
system. Thompson thinks that the avoidance of the use of weapons of mass
destruction that has worked to prevent wars among the great powers since
World War II will hold in the next few decades because a war that uses
these would likely be disastrous for all sides of the conflict and for
large numbers of others not directly involved (but see Goddard and
Larkin, 2025). So far, the Russia--Ukraine war seems to encourage this
position. But Thompson also notes that the situation of mutually assured
mass destruction has been, and still is, vulnerable to accidents and
miscommunications of the kind that nearly led to nuclear war several
times during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet
Union. We agree with Thompson that even with growing interimperial
rivalry between China and the United States and concurrent hot wars in
Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the likelihood is that there will
not be a war among great powers in which weapons of mass destruction are
used because decision-makers believe that such a war is unwinnable and
would be devastating for both sides. But we also note what Thompson said
about accidents and miscommunication during periods of stress. Another
world war is not likely but could happen. If it does, it would probably
not kill all the humans and so sociocultural evolution would start back
up again.¶ Power Configurations: G2 Bipolarity, Tripolarity, or
Multipolarity? [Thompson thinks that the [most likely **next power
configuration**]{.mark} **will be [bipolarity]{.mark}** between a
[regional system]{.mark} in [East Asia]{.mark} with [China]{.mark} [as
the regional hegemon]{.mark} and in the [Americas with the US]{.mark}
world hegemony reduced to a regional hegemony. **He calls this 'G2'.
Thompson contends that the [US decline in global power shares will
likely cease at about 25%,]{.mark}** down from its post-World War II
peak, but will probably **[stabilize]{.mark}** at around that point. And
that **the [United States]{.mark} will [establish]{.mark} a secure
[regional hegemony]{.mark} that [it can]{.mark} afford to
[defend]{.mark}** and provide for.]{.underline} We agree that this
bipolar G-2 configuration of global power is probably the most likely
power configuration for the next several decades. [This would be
[bipolar]{.mark}, but the [difference between the US and the Chinese
shares of global power]{.mark} would probably be [smaller]{.mark}
[than]{.mark} was the difference between the United States and Soviet
Union shares during the [Cold War]{.mark} (see Figure 6). And there
could [be other regional hegemonies centered on Europe, Russia, Brazil,
India, or South Africa]{.mark} during the period of multicentricity.
Depending on the relative power sizes of these, the coming power
configuration could be bipolar, tripolar, or multipolar.]{.underline}

#### Multilateral institutions and other great powers offset the balance.

Donald Trump: Implications for international relations, Global Dynamics
and strategic balance. AKSU Journal of Management Sciences, 10(1),

[The potential [re-election of Donald Trump]{.mark} in 2024 would have
[significant implications]{.mark} for international relations, global
dynamics, and the strategic balance of power.]{.underline} Based on his
past policies and \"America First\" approach, the following are key
recommendations for various actors in the global arena to consider: i.
Strengthening Multilateral Institutions with Caution: While Trump's
previous tenure saw skepticism and withdrawal from various multilateral
agreements, it's important for international organizations to
recalibrate their engagement strategies in anticipation of his potential
re-election. These organizations should explore ways to maintain
influence by offering more flexible, pragmatic partnerships,
accommodating U.S. interests while ensuring the overall integrity of the
system. [For example: [NATO]{.mark} should work to [reassure the
U.S]{.mark}. that European security and collective defense remain a
priority while encouraging more equitable burden-sharing within the
alliance. The [UN and WTO]{.mark} should consider [reform]{.mark}ing
their structures to make them more responsive to U.S.
concerns]{.underline}, while ensuring that the core principles of global
cooperation, human rights, and free trade remain intact. ii. European
Union: Defending Interests While Engaging with the U.S[[.: European
leaders will]{.mark} need to [balance a commitment]{.mark} to
transatlantic unity with the reality of potential tensions due to
Trump's ―America First‖ stance. A two-pronged approach is necessary: The
EU should continue to work closely with the U.S. on key security issues,
such as NATO defense spending and counterterrorism, but should [avoid
becoming overly dependent]{.mark} on Washington's leadership in global
governance. In the face of potential U.S. withdrawal from international
agreements, the [EU]{.mark} should [bolster its own foreign
policy]{.mark} and security capabilities, especially in areas like
defense, trade, and climate action.]{.underline} It could further cement
its role as a counterbalance to both U.S. and Chinese influence in
global forums. iii. China and Russia: Leveraging Opportunities,
Preparing for Rivalry: [Both of these global powers have seen
opportunities to advance their interests in a world where U.S.
leadership is less predictable. However, they must be prepared for the
volatility that a re-elected Trump may bring, especially in terms of
trade and security dynamics. [China and Russia]{.mark} should
[strengthen their partnerships]{.mark}, particularly in economic and
technological sectors, [to counterbalance a potentially retrenched U.S.
role in global leadership.]{.mark}]{.underline} The strengthening of
ties through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and
closer defense cooperation could align their strategic interests in
Eurasia and beyond. Both China and Russia must stay attuned to Trump's
potential protectionist and unilateral approach, particularly in terms
of tariffs, sanctions, and military posture. They must remain agile and
ready to pivot quickly in response to U.S. moves that could affect their
interests iv. Global South: Navigating a Changing Geopolitical
Landscape: Countries in the Global South, particularly in Africa, Latin
America, and Southeast Asia, will face growing challenges as U.S.
foreign policy becomes more transactional. Many of these nations rely on
the U.S. for trade, aid, and security cooperation[. To reduce dependency
on the U.S., these countries should strengthen ties with [other global
players like China, the EU, India, and regional
powers]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, countries in Africa could
increase engagement with China's BRI, while Latin American states may
look to diversify trade agreements away from the U.S. Building regional
coalitions and strengthening organizations such as the African Union
(AU) or the Latin American Community of Nations (CELAC) could allow
these countries to build resilience to potential disruptions in U.S.
foreign policy. v. The Middle East: Navigating Shifting Alliances:
Trump's \"America First\" policies often led to a transactional approach
to the Middle East, notably through the Abraham Accords and his support
for authoritarian leaders. If re-elected, Trump's policies could lead to
further instability in the region, especially in terms of U.S.
disengagement from multilateral peace processes and security agreements.
Middle Eastern countries should expect that the U.S. will demand more
from its allies, particularly in defense spending and trade agreements.
However, they should also be prepared for a potential pullback from U.S.
intervention in regional conflicts. Countries like Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, and Israel could look to deepen their ties with Russia and China
for security and economic purposes. [The formation of [new security
pacts]{.mark}, possibly with Russia, could [provide a counterbalance to
any perceived U.S. retreat]{.mark} from the region.]{.underline} vi.
Global Trade and Economic Cooperation: Prepare for Protectionism:
Trump's economic policies, such as tariffs, trade wars, and the
withdrawal from trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP), could continue to disrupt global trade patterns. [Countries may
increasingly [pursue bilateral or regional trade agreements
outside]{.mark} of the U.S. sphere. [The EU, China, and Japan could
strengthen existing partnership]{.mark}s, while emerging economies could
pursue new trade deals to bypass U.S. tariffs. Countries should continue
to champion free trade agreements within regional groupings (e.g., the
RCEP in Asia) and focus on digital economy partnerships, which could
provide growth avenues even amid protectionist trends.]{.underline} vii.
Climate Change and Global Governance: Anticipate Fragmentation: Trump's
past decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement demonstrated
a lack of prioritization for global environmental issues. If re-elected,
his stance could make coordinated global action on climate change more
difficult. Nations should take the lead on climate action in their
regions. The EU, for example, could deepen its Green Deal, while
countries in Asia or Africa could push for regional sustainability
agreements that are less dependent on U.S. leadership. [Countries
heavily invested in climate action, such as small island states, should
seek to deepen their partnerships with other climate-conscious nations
(e.g., the EU, China, India), bypassing the U.S. when
necessary.]{.underline}

#### Nato Fills In

Narrative on China in a Shifting Global Order (Dissertation). Retrieved

//HAF9000**

Complicating this effort is the alliance's diverse composition, with
member states holding varying political, economic, and security
interests concerning China. These differences can make achieving
alignment on a unified approach challenging. NATO must navigate the dual
task of deterring potential 6 aggressive actions by China while
preserving diplomatic flexibility and avoiding unnecessary escalation.
[The structure and decision-making processes within NATO add to the
academic significance of this analysis. As an [intergovernmental]{.mark}
[organisation]{.mark}, [NATO]{.mark} embodies a [broad spectrum of
interest]{.mark}s and perspectives (NATO, 2024)]{.underline}.
Investigating its strategic narrative provides insight into how the
alliance negotiates internal differences, builds strategic consensus,
and conveys a unified message to global audiences. It also highlights
the diplomatic and communicative strategies required to align national
interests with collective objectives, shedding light on the complexities
of alliance management and the pursuit of unity in diversity. In this
context, the research problem lies in examining how NATO constructs a
strategic narrative that addresses these challenges while positioning
China as a significant security concern. [By analysing NATO's strategic
narrative on China, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of
how [intergovernmental organisations adapt to and address emerging
global security challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} 1.2 Aim Studying
NATO\'s strategic narrative surrounding China offers an opportunity to
explore the intersection of international security, geopolitics, and
alliance dynamics. [As [China]{.mark} rises as a global power, its
[expanding]{.mark} [influence]{.mark} has [profound]{.mark}
[implications]{.mark} for global order and security (Simón, 2023).
[NATO]{.mark}, historically [focused]{.mark} [on]{.mark} safeguarding
[Euro]{.mark}-[Atlantic]{.mark} security, now [finds]{.mark}
[itself]{.mark} [navigating]{.mark} a rapidly shifting landscape where
[China's]{.mark} [presence]{.mark} and actions are felt far
[beyond]{.mark} [Asia]{.mark}, extending [into]{.mark} [regions]{.mark}
[traditionally]{.mark} seen as [peripheral]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[NATO's]{.mark} core interests.]{.underline} Understanding NATO\'s
evolving narrative on China sheds light on how the alliance perceives
this transformation and adapts to address it. Strategic narratives, such
as NATO\'s framing of China, are more than mere descriptions of reality,
they are also prescriptive tools that actively shape perceptions, build
legitimacy for policies, and influence stakeholders on multiple levels
(Miskimmon et al, 2013: 1-2). [Through its narrative, [NATO]{.mark}
[positions]{.mark} [itself]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [a]{.mark} global
[actor]{.mark} capable of [addressing]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [only]{.mark}
[regional]{.mark} [threats]{.mark} but [also]{.mark} [challenges]{.mark}
[posed]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a major power like [China]{.mark}. This
narrative reflects [NATO]{.mark}'s attempt to [redefine]{.mark}
[its]{.mark} [mandate]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [scope]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}n increasingly interconnected and [multipolar world]{.mark}.
At its core, NATO\'s narrative on China serves as a lens to [explore
broader themes of global power dynamics, alliance cohesion, and]{.mark}
the evolving concept of [security in the 21st
century]{.mark}.]{.underline} It raises critical questions about the
role of traditional 7 security alliances in addressing non-traditional
threats, such as economic coercion, cyberattacks, and the strategic
implications of technological advancements. Finally, this thesis aims to
address a research gap in the study of strategic narratives by focusing
on NATO's construction of a strategic narrative about China. While
previous research has explored how China crafts strategic narratives
about NATO, limited attention has been given to the reverse. Although
there is extensive research on NATO's construction of strategic
narratives in general, these studies primarily focus on other actors or
issues, such as Russia or Euro-Atlantic security, rather than China. By
examining NATO's evolving narrative on China, this thesis contributes an
empirical example to the broader study of strategic narrative

CONCLUSION In order to be able to predict what the world economy has
experienced from the past to the present and the possible scenarios it
will experience in the future, it is necessary to understand the
phenomenon of globalization. With globalization, there has been an
increase in communication and transportation resources in particular.
This has led to an easier movement of goods, services, capital, etc.
between countries[. Therefore, in the postglobalization period,
[connections]{.mark} between countries have [increased]{.mark} and all
[countries]{.mark} have almost [become]{.mark} [competitors]{.mark}. The
competitive environment has [helped]{.mark} [countries]{.mark}
[develop]{.mark}. This situation has brought [new]{.mark} pole
[candidates]{.mark} to the agenda that can [shake]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[economic power of the USA]{.mark}. The 21st-century [economy]{.mark} is
[progressively shifting away from]{.mark} a [unipolar]{.mark}
framework.]{.underline} A primary factor contributing to this transition
has been identified as the swift expansion of developing nations
following the global financial crisis of 2008. Consequently, the 2008
crisis is widely regarded as the onset of the decline of the United
States, the epitome of unipolarity. [Current assessments indicate [that
emerging global powers have begun to eclipse the United States]{.mark}.
[Should]{.mark} [one]{.mark} or more of these rising economies succeed
in [dismant]{.mark}ling [U.S. hegemony]{.mark}, which embodies
unipolarity, they may establish themselves as a new global power[,
lead]{.mark}ing the 21st century [toward]{.mark} a [multipolar]{.mark}
system]{.underline}. A defining characteristic of this multipolar world
is the diminishing centrality of the United States in economic cycles
and financial market trends, which will increasingly reflect a
multipolar nature. In this context, business practices will also
transform within a more multipolar global economy. Companies in various
markets are expected to gain influence over industrial sectors in
developing nations, mirroring trends seen in developed countries[. A
more [multipolar global econ]{.mark}omy will hold [significant
implications for all developing nations]{.mark}, even if not for each
one individually. Conversely, the [widespread distribution of global
growth]{.mark} is set to generate [new external drivers for
expansion]{.mark}. Consequently, the [shocks]{.mark} experienced within
a multipolar system will [exert lesser effects on nations compared
to]{.mark} those arising in a [unipolar]{.mark} system. 13 In terms of
international finance, the most probable scenario within the
international [monetary system is likely to be]{.mark} [around
the]{.mark} US [dollar]{.mark}, the [Euro]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[Renminbi]{.mark}. [Diversification]{.mark} [of]{.mark} foreign exchange
[reserve]{.mark} sources will [help developing countries]{.mark} more
easily [achieve]{.mark} their [reserve]{.mark} accumulation
[goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the existence of more than one
reserve increases the supply of safe assets, the increase in different
reserve substitutes will also limit fluctuations in exchange rates and
reserve asset prices. On the other hand, the emergence of new
competitors to the dollar will expand the range of market actors. This
will make it difficult for the reserve issuer to act arbitrarily. The
monopoly status of the dollar in the market allows the US to act without
worry. However, reversal of this situation by multipolarity will cause
the US to be more cautious. [When examining the transition process to
multipolarity, it is necessary to start with the US, the sole hegemonic
power. The power of the [US]{.mark}, which represents
[unipolarity]{.mark}, [will]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [continue]{.mark}
[into]{.mark} the [infinite]{.mark} [future]{.mark} and will
[prepare]{.mark} the ground for the [transition]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[multipolarity]{.mark} with the emergence of new centers of power. When
the global economy is evaluated as a whole, it is likely that
[power]{.mark} is [shifting]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the West [to]{.mark}
the [East]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is possible to say that Asia\'s
dynamic economy and young population have left most of the world behind
as a leader. Especially after 2008, approximately 50% of the world
economy has shifted to Asia and the Eastern Regions. This rise of Asia
has revealed that the idea of the superiority of the West is changing.
[When the study results are evaluated as a whole, they include evidence
that [economic]{.mark} [multipolarity]{.mark} has a [positive]{.mark}
[effect]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [growth]{.mark}. At this point, the spread
of [multipolarity]{.mark} in the economy [will]{.mark}
[positively]{.mark} [affect]{.mark} [growth]{.mark} rates in the world.
In order to increase the degree of multipolarity and to make it
widespread, the following situations should be taken into consideration.
When evaluated in general, taking steps on issues such as giving
importance to [trade]{.mark}, [increasing]{.mark} [direct]{.mark}
[foreign]{.mark} [investment]{.mark} flows and intra-industry trade,
spreading and developing [info]{.mark}rmation [and]{.mark}
[comm]{.mark}unication [tech]{.mark}nologies, increasing
[sustainable]{.mark} [investments]{.mark}, especially in human capital,
and continuing [governance]{.mark} [reforms]{.mark} together with
institutional reforms will [help]{.mark} countries to [create]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark} [poles]{.mark}. In this context, the increase in the
power of countries that can create [multiple]{.mark} [poles]{.mark} will
also [create]{.mark} [positive]{.mark} [effects]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
economic [growth]{.mark} and make the world a stronger
place.]{.underline} It is thought that the study will provide a
different perspective on the concept of \"multipolarity\", which is a
new economic order, and will shed light on the evaluation of its
relationship with different economic areas and the conduct of different
empirical studies with different data.

#### Multipolarity is stabilizing and cooperative.

[We found that [multipolarity]{.mark}, characterized by the presence of
several powerful states, could [enhance the likelihood of international
coop]{.mark}eration.]{.underline} Thus, H1 is confirmed. In essence,
[[large, powerful countries]{.mark} can [play a stabilizing role]{.mark}
in the international system [by promoting cooperative behavior]{.mark}
among states.]{.underline} [Large countries have more resources to
invest in cooperative ventures, which can serve as anchors for stability
and predictability (**Waltz 1979**). Additionally[, their greater
technological and economic capabilities may lead to higher gains from
cooperation, incentivizing them to pursue collaborative
strategies]{.mark} (**Keohane 1984**). These findings support the idea
that multipolar systems are more flexible and contain more interaction
opportunities (**Väyrynen 1995**). Under multipolarity,
[countries]{.mark} could [exhibit greater risk aversion,]{.mark} leading
to [a more pluralistic and balanced state--society]{.mark} relationship
due to greater variations in beliefs and institutions (**Väyrynen
1995**).]{.underline} This could decrease the global risks associated
with the economy, society, and geopolitical domains (**Acharya et al.
2023**). On the other hand, the main concern associated with
multipolarity is the isolation of states that are capable of building
advanced weapons, posing a significant threat to global welfare (**Posen
2009**). Negative risk perceptions could also trigger a feeling of
insecurity, followed by an organized shift towards self-sufficiency and
autarky (**Malcomson 2021**). Major-power autarky is defensive, and it
is not necessarily associated with a more dangerous world scenario
(**Malcomson 2021**); however, because of the inevitable locked-in
situations in the global system, this is a very concerning situation to
address. An unagonized return to protectionism and autarky could lead to
a situation known as a "security dilemma" (**Axelrod 1984**), in which
agents prioritize their own security over the security and welfare of
others. In the context of our analysis, global cooperation can falter
for several reasons. One significant factor is when cooperation reaches
a low point, creating a fertile ground for generalized disruption. Our
simulations consistently exhibit a pattern of alternating cycles between
increasing cooperation and increasing competition, akin to Kondratieff
cycles observed in economic theories, regardless of the chosen
parameters or number of large countries involved. Therefore, H2 is
confirmed. In such scenarios, minor disagreements or conflicts can
escalate rapidly, undermining trust and collaboration among nations,
leading to armed conflicts and destabilization (**Keohane 1984**).
Additionally, the introduction of new, aggressive strategies by
influential countries aiming to alter the status quo can destabilize the
existing balance of power (**Jervis 1978**). This shift can lead to an
environment in which competitive rather than cooperative behaviors
dominate, increasing the likelihood of widespread international crises
(**Mearsheimer 2001**). Multipolarity could take two possible
directions: (i) multi-growth and cooperation with sustainability, or
(ii) multi-threat of the world as we know it today (**Perskaya 2017**).
In an international geopolitical setting, multipolarity supported by
conflicting agendas is the most serious source of uncertainty concerning
global governance[. On the other hand, a more optimistic development for
international cooperation in a multipolar framework is cooperative
multipolarity (**de Aguiar Patriota 2017**). To achieve sustainability
and welfare at a global level, institutions and legislative frameworks
operating at a global level are in a position to define, apply, monitor,
and enforce technical and economic conditions and rules for a set of
operators (**Agrell 2015**).]{.underline} Consequently, if societies and
countries aim to promote social welfare, the role of institutions and
specific economic structures in fostering sufficient, sustainable, and
inclusive growth through the interconnection effect is crucial
(**Kanzola 2023**). [This discussion is already prominent because
[promoting stability under multipolarity is critical]{.mark} (**Roberts
2023**). In this direction, there is [an emerging need for the
configuration of conditions that favor cooperation]{.mark}.
[Multilateral organizations]{.mark} such as the International Monetary
Fund ([IMF]{.mark}), [World Bank]{.mark}, and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([NATO]{.mark}) will play a pivotal role (**Tago
2017**).]{.underline} Nonetheless, the aforementioned international
cooperation platforms as well as the overall global governance
architecture need reform (**Sithole et al. 2024**). This argument is
supported by the historical evolution of these mechanisms. They were
established after World War II, when the dynamics of world powers
differed significantly from those today. It is questionable whether the
current institutional framework can adequately respond to the challenges
posed by the diverse influences on universal balance. The international
system of intervention and supervision of the global cooperation agenda,
such as the IMF, World Bank, and World Trade Organization (WTO), should
adapt to the new conditions. In this direction, it is important to
redefine the meaning of development, economic growth, global threats,
and sustainability in order to align with life values and, therefore, be
acceptable to all players (**Orliange 2021**). In economics, there is
also the rising question of whether the dollar, as a reserve currency,
is slowly but steadily losing its influence. This is a double-edged
sword because it raises issues regarding the global lender of the last
resort and questions global stability. For the time being, the USA
remains at the top of the global power hierarchy (**Ryan 2023**).
Another example of the destabilization of the world order is the
possibility of a food crisis. During the 2008 food crisis (**De Schutter
2009**), it was required to use new "unconventional" policy measures,
highlighting the need for the establishment of new cooperation tools
capable to prevent universal hunger (**Peres and De Souza Daibert
2017**). Hence, the absence of effective world back-stop mechanisms (in
economic and security relations) increases the difficulty of keeping the
ball from leaving the field---by increasing the risk and the possibility
of systematic world welfare leakages. A factor that potentially promotes
cooperation is global trade, but this does not include the globalization
of production (**Brooks 2024**). [Furthermore, [enhancing trust,
transparency, and respect for cultural and national values]{.mark} as
well as establishing [an accepted agenda for common global action are
indispensable]{.mark} for effective cooperation and conflict resolution
in our increasingly interconnected world.]{.underline} In the history of
human cooperation, forces and changes have bound us together, while
others have driven us apart. As a principle, the future is
simultaneously unknown and known because it is generated in the present
(**Kanzola 2023**). Taking action in the present will favor a desirable
future in terms of global developments, provided that individuals,
institutions, and governments are forward looking. Nevertheless, it is
important to remember that the future also depends on elements of order
and randomness (**McKinsey Global Institute 2023**; **Watts 2003**). In
other words, it is impossible to predict negative or positive
serendipity; we can only prepare for what we know. [Therefore,
[efficient cooperation is possible and promotes stability]{.mark} but is
not inherently guaranteed; [it requires time, trust, effort, and proper
dynamics.]{.mark} In return, it [offers stability, risk mitigation, and
security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### It can facilitate peace- but attempts at hegemony undermine necessary cooperation.

5\. Concluding Remarks¶ In this study, we explored whether multipolarity
contributes to cooperation using an iterated game theory approach. [Our
findings suggest that the [presence of multipolarity tends to
increase]{.mark} the likelihood of [cooperation]{.mark}, at least from a
theoretical perspective. This finding is important given the current
discussion that the new multipolar order of the world economy could
undermine global stability.]{.underline} Nevertheless, in order to ward
off this dangerous possibility, proper institutional structures and the
alignment of social goal setting are required (Waltz 2000). Under these
conditions, a multipolar system could lead to the development of the
global economy by avoiding the use of military conflicts. In any case,
it should be mentioned that the promotion of cooperation is a difficult
attempt given that policymakers and governments often discard
theoretical models and insights for reasons related to the importance of
historical path dependence, national interests, and tradition.¶ To
ensure global sustainability, it is important to introduce a consistent
framework for the market economy that balances risks and rewards and
promotes systematic resilience (Roberts 2023). Otherwise, trying to
minimize risks reduces rewards and creates vulnerabilities (Roberts
2023). At the same time, trying to always maximize rewards could lead to
overlooking potential threats and risks (Roberts 2023). [Therefore, the
future of [global cooperation]{.mark} and welfare in a multipolar
setting [depends on]{.mark} finding mutually beneficial activities and
[a]{.mark} strict [legislative framework that prohibits one party from

ability to foresee the dangers and opportunities of a changing order of

for maintaining international stability and peace (Oye 1986).

A balance of power reading of Thucydides suggests that US\' efforts to
maintain its post-Cold War hegemonic position, either unilaterally or
through broader consent, are bound to fail. [The [post-Cold War
"unipolar]{.mark} moment" was not a permanent fact but rather [a
temporary artifact of]{.mark} the sudden and [unexpected collapse of one
pole]{.mark} in a bipolar system.^187^]{.underline} By virtue of its
large population and high level of economic growth, China was destined
to replace the Soviet Union as another pole in the 21st century
international system. The interesting question is not whether
unipolarity will last but will it be replaced with a bipolar or
multipolar system?^[188]{.underline}^

One of the most important causes of hegemonic wars in the wake of power
transitions is the security dilemma, the unintended dynamic in which the
efforts one state takes to ensure its security often undermine that of
others.^[189]{.underline}^ [While in an anarchical international system,
the [security]{.mark} [dilemma can]{.mark} never be completely
eliminated, it can be [mitigated by]{.mark} the [policies]{.mark} states
adopt.]{.underline} Thucydides attributes the Peloponnesian War to the
breakdown of the balance of power between Athens and Sparta and he
applauds Pericles' efforts to try to re-establish it through restraint
rather than replacing Spartan hegemony. [Not only is a [balance of
power]{.mark} grand strategy [less likely to exacerbate the security
dilemma]{.mark}, it is eminently more feasible and [will better serve
American interests.]{.mark}^190^]{.underline}

A balance of power approach by the USA in its rivalry with China will be
effective because it builds upon a number of well-established tendencies
in international politics.^[191]{.underline}^ Most importantly, states
tend to balance against threats, rather than bandwagoning with
them.^[192]{.underline}^ As China grows more powerful and assertive,
states closest to it are feeling a greater sense of peril. Their
response will be to seek ways to respond to that threat by
counterbalancing it. [A [less]{.mark} forward and [assertive US
posture]{.mark} will not only mitigate the security dilemma with China
but also [dampen]{.mark} common pathologies of balancing such as
[buck-passing by allies]{.mark} to the larger power and otherwise
[under-providing for their own security]{.mark}.]{.underline} The common
problem behind both is what economists call "moral hazard," or the
propensity of actors to behave recklessly if another is insuring them
against its consequences.^[193]{.underline}^

Some fret that recent Chinese investments in anti-access/area denial
(A2/AD) technologies make it harder for the USA to continue to project
power close to China. However, these same technologies could also
bolster America's beleaguered allies in the
region.^[194]{.underline}^ Taiwan, the most probable *casus belli*, is
further from mainland China than Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe
and about the same distance that Cuba was from Cold War Florida. Despite
these relatively short distances, neither was ever successfully invaded.
Today, China will have to project power across water, always a dicey
proposition but one made even harder now if US allies in the region
invest in their own A2/AD technologies to preserve the balance of power.

[Donald [Trump's return]{.mark} to the White House [raises the question
of whether he might be more amenable to replacing America's
long-standing Primacy approach]{.mark} to maintaining the status quo in
the Western Pacific [with one premised upon a balance]{.mark} of
power?^195^ There are, in fact, grounds for thinking that [Trump might
be.]{.mark}]{.underline} The latter approach would not seek to prevent
any change in the region, only those that threaten the global balance of
power. [[During his first term]{.mark} in office, he [adopted a more
"transactional approach]{.mark} \[which\] often [differed from]{.mark}
his team's [competitive approach]{.mark}."^196^]{.underline} To be sure,
the recently re-elected former President has not shied away from
economic competition with China and has shown little compunction about
rattling the tariff saber and even threatening a trade war. [But he
seems "[ambivalent" about embracing]{.mark} the [American China
hawks']{.mark} commitment to defend Taiwan against China if it seeks
independence.^197^ Hardly anyone would compare the former and future
President to the great Athenian leader Pericles, but it is entirely
possible that Trump might at least embrace a Periclean balance of power
approach as a way out of the Thucydides' Trap.]{.underline}

Inflection Points and Great Power War

Heim and Miller (2020) used a modified version of the Pardee GPI to
model future changes in the relative distribution of power using a
baseline model that does not include international conflict to examine
what differences population explosion, a lost decade of Chinese economic
growth, or different degrees and speed of onset of global warming would
make for the relative power shares of national-states. They also
employed Charles Doran's (2012) version of power transition theory to
try to predict when the risk of war between the United States and the
P.R.C. would be highest. All the models of power transition imply that
when a rising power gets close to, or passes, the relative power of the
old hegemon the risk of war is high. But Doran's version sees other
inflection points when the rates of change increase or decrease. This
produces confusion and uncertainty and makes it difficult for
decision-makers to be clear about what is happening. And Doran contends
that when several of the great powers (core states) go through
inflection points in the same short period the risk of warfare is
higher. The most obvious inflection point in Figure 6 is around 2040
when China's GPI score is likely to pass the United States. But when we
track economic and military power shares separately[, as in Figure 5, we
can see that it will probably **take China longer to catch up with the
US military** share level than the US economic power share level. [The
risk of war]{.mark} is probably more influenced by military inflection
points, and this implies that the dangerous period might [**not arrive
until the 2050s**.]{.mark} The]{.underline} uneven onset of global
warming and climate change disasters will probably alter the
probabilities regarding which configurations of global power emerge in
the next several decades. The Heim and Miller model of the GPI tried
different levels of temperature increase and models of which regions are
likely to be affected the most. [The global warming scenarios show that
**China will see a significant increase in global power relative to the
baseline model, Russia will see a slight gain and the United States and
India will experience moderate declines**]{.underline} (Heim and Miller
2020: Figure 19, p.20; Figure 21, p.21).

Thompson's (2022) book on the decline of US systemic leadership uses the
power cycle theoretical research program that he developed with George
Modelski to update their estimates of shares of long-distance military
power projection (see also Lee and Thompson, 2018) and to ponder the
short-run future of the global power system. [Thompson thinks that the
avoidance of the use of **[w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction that has worked to [prevent wars]{.mark}** among
the great powers since World War II will hold in the next few decades
because a [war]{.mark} that uses these would likely [be disastrous for
all sides]{.mark} of the conflict and for large numbers of others not
directly involved (but see Goddard and Larkin, 2025)]{.underline}. So
far, the Russia--Ukraine war seems to encourage this position. But
Thompson also notes that the situation of mutually assured mass
destruction has been, and still is, vulnerable to accidents and
miscommunications of the kind that nearly led to nuclear war several
times during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet
Union. [We agree with Thompson that [even with growing]{.mark}
interimperial [rivalry]{.mark} between China and the United States and
concurrent hot wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the
likelihood is that there [will not be a war among great powers]{.mark}
in which weapons of mass destruction are used because decision-makers
believe that such a war is unwinnable and would be devastating for both
sides.]{.underline} [But we also note what Thompson said about accidents
and miscommunication during periods of stress. Another world war is not
likely but could happen. **If it does, it [would]{.mark} probably [not
kill all]{.mark} the [humans]{.mark}** and so sociocultural evolution
would start back up again.]{.underline}

SHCP AB\]**

In this third nuclear age, North Korea is no longer a nonproliferation
challenge, but a nuclear deterrence problem for the US.

For American allies in Europe and East Asia, these developments are
leading to greater insecurity and anxiety. The world is more dangerous
and, with it, the threat of conventional war between states and an
ensuing nuclear conflict is higher than it has been in decades. [An
[America]{.mark} that was [faithful]{.mark} to the essential insight of
the Gilpatric committee [would respond]{.mark} to this [with
reassurance]{.mark}. [Instead]{.mark}, at the Munich Security Conference
in February, US Vice President JD [Vance excoriated European
values,]{.mark} suggesting a [US]{.mark} [administration]{.mark} that is
[uninterested in Europe's sovereignty]{.mark} -- perhaps even its
survival. His speech [echoed]{.mark} what [Trump]{.mark} has long
stated: that America's [allies]{.mark} have been taking Washington for a
ride for decades, were [undeserving of its protection]{.mark} and must
'pay their fair share'.\]{.underline}
\
[[At question]{.mark} now [is]{.mark} America's [commitment to]{.mark}
NATO and the [Article 5]{.mark} collective defence clause,
[including]{.mark} its willingness to maintain the [US nuclear
umbrella]{.mark} under which member states have sheltered. The
ambivalence is underscored by Trump's inconsistent pronouncements.
Campaigning in the run-up to his first presidency,
[Trump suggested So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Japan]{.mark} might
[need to acquire nuclear weapons]{.mark}, for instance.]{.underline} At
other times he has termed the spread of nuclear weapons the 'single
biggest threat' to the world.

Like his predecessors, Trump appears to believe that American
adversaries such as Iran should remain non-nuclear. [Yet in 2018 during
his first presidential term, [Trump]{.mark} chose to [withdraw]{.mark}
the US [from]{.mark} the 2015 [Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action]{.mark} which [limited Iran's nuclear weapons programme]{.mark}
in exchange for sanctions relief.]{.underline} Iran is now believed to
be closer than ever to developing its first nuclear weapon.

Trump contradictions

At the same time, Trump has shown an interest in deep arms reductions
with Russia and China, an objective that would become far more difficult
should American ambivalence towards its allies push them to acquire
nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear-armed Germany, Poland,
South Korea and Japan may be unlikely -- but should it take shape and
impinge upon the security interests of Moscow and Beijing, arms control
and reduction among the major powers would be nigh-on impossible.\
\
For America's allies, these contradictions may be beside the point[.
America [can no longer be treated as]{.mark} the cornerstone of their
[national defence]{.mark}, and relying on [Washington]{.mark} for
deterrence [may be]{.mark} more of a [liability]{.mark} than an
asset.]{.underline} Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, failed to persuade
allies that their experience in Trump's first term was an aberration and
that the US was fundamentally ready to 'repair our alliances and engage
with the world once again'.

For allies, relying on Washington for deterrence may be more of a
liability than an asset.

With Trump's re-election, allies are starting to take matters into their
own hands. [[European spending on]{.mark} national [defence]{.mark}
has [spiked in]{.mark} the first months of [2025]{.mark} and the
continent's two nuclear powers, Britain and France, are exploring ways
to reassure European allies in order to prevent uncontrolled
proliferation.]{.underline}

US--ROK relations for the first time in decades. [The [US commitment to
So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [rests on an internationalist
consensus]{.mark} in the Washington foreign policy
community.]{.underline}**60** [Post Trump, that consensus is no longer
assured.]{.underline} Trump has upended the Republican Party and its
traditional internationalism. He clearly resents US alliance
commitments.**61** [For example, in 2024, he said he would "[encourage
Russia to do whatever]{.mark} the hell [they want]{.mark}" in Europe,
because NATO states were not spending enough on
defense]{.underline}.**62** So concerned were South Koreans after that
remark, that the ROK defense minister felt compelled to publicly address
potential US abandonment.**63** During his first presidency, Trump
stated his desire to "blow up" the US--ROK alliance if re-elected.**64**
[He also [hinted at breaking the US--Japan]{.mark} Security
[Treaty]{.mark}.]{.underline}**65** Further, Trump\'s remaking of the
Republican Party will likely endure. He has so reshaped it that critics
routinely deride it as a cult of personality.**66** Polling suggests
that Republican voters agree with Trump\'s America First
unilateralism.**67** Trumpist Republican disinterest in partnerships is
already evident in Europe, where Republican opposition to Ukraine
assistance has grown over the course of the Russo--Ukraine War. Even
participation in NATO has become problematic for the Trumpized
GOP.**68** For South Korea, this implies abandonment anxieties whenever
a Republican holds the US presidency. Scenarios: Ukraine and Korea [As
noted, [Ukraine]{.mark} is a [possible analogue to So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea [and its nuc]{.mark}lear [dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Both countries are middle-sized players in the American network whose
loss would not directly impact US homeland security. It is unclear how
much nuclear risk the United States will carry for such states. Russian
President Vladimir Putin has successfully deterred deeper NATO
involvement in the Russo--Ukraine war with oblique threats of nuclear
escalation. Western pundits were quite candid at the war\'s start that
nuclear escalation fears were the reason for NATO to reject Ukraine\'s
request for a no-fly zone.**69** Similarly, fears of provoking Russian
escalation have consistently limited NATO weapons shipments to
Ukraine.**70** [There is [a lesson]{.mark} here [for No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea: [its nuclear weapons might inhibit US aid]{.mark} in a
similar peninsular scenario.]{.underline} Importantly, US guarantees to
South Korea are formalized as treaty; NATO is not thusly committed to
Ukraine.**71** The United States also has some forces on the peninsula
in a trip-wire capacity. So perhaps the United States would more
willingly risk nuclear retaliation to help South Korea than Ukraine. Or
it might be chain-ganged into a Korean conflict by initial tripwire
casualties. Both arguments suggest an automaticity to US involvement in
Korea, what strategic theory calls "hand-tying"**72**: even if the
United States did not want to fight, it would be pulled in anyway. There
are no historical data to corroborate a tripwire\'s chain-gang
efficaciousness in a nuclear scenario. However, much strategic theory is
skeptical, as was de Gaulle. Nuclear theorist Robert Jervis decried the
"conventionalization" of nuclear weapons, in which their unique impact
on military decisions, such as escalation, was overlooked.**73** The
likelihood of one\'s country being struck by nuclear weapons, he
thought, produces a dramatic risk aversion in decision-makers. Nuclear
retaliation against the homeland was so terrifying -- Jervis called it
"armageddon" -- that states would show extraordinary caution. US
behavior in the Cuban missile crisis and the Russo--Ukraine War
illustrates that caution. So does India\'s restrained response to
repeated Pakistani post-nuclear provocations.**74** Kenneth Waltz found
extreme caution so likely that he controversially counseled
proliferation to keep the peace!**75** If this is correct, intense risk
aversion to a nuclear strike, coupled to North Korea\'s high nuclear use
incentives, undermine the automatic chain gang effect of the US
alliance[. And this uncertainty -- what Thomas Schelling called the
"[threat]{.mark} that leaves something to chance"]{.underline}**76** [--
is [enough to alter Seoul\'s strategic perceptions]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As Gerzhoy writes,**77** even if the patron would meet its obligations,
"the slightest possibility that the patron will renege on its promises
has disproportionate effects on the client\'s calculations." [This
nicely summarizes [the ROK pronuclear position:]{.mark} hope the
Americans will fight but [develop local deterrence in case]{.mark} they
do not.]{.underline}

1\. Introduction At the center of one of the most ongoing and complex
geopolitical discussions in the modern Middle East is Iran\'s nuclear
initiative. Often seen through the binary prism of proliferation versus
compliance, the program is really the result of a deeply ingrained
strategic calculus molded by Iran\'s past, regional rivalries, and
changing security environment. By means of regional power dynamics,
strategic hedging, and ideological identification, this study aims to
expose the fundamental reasons behind Iran\'s nuclear aspirations. The
report underlines that Iran\'s nuclear policy is not only an attempt to
achieve military capability but also a deliberate and symbolic maneuver
to safeguard sovereignty, reinforce regional influence, and balance
asymmetric threats. Iran has chosen a strategy of nuclear hedging,
developing the technical means to reach nuclear threshold status while
staying inside the legal limits of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) instead of following an obvious road toward nuclear weaponization.
Tehran\'s ambiguous posture lets it benefit from diplomatic leverage and
deterrence without inviting the full results of international reprisals.
Combined with ongoing U.S. hostility and regional Sunni rivalries,
especially with Israel and Saudi Arabia, historical grievances,
including the 1953 coup and the Iran-Iraq War, have ingrained a sense of
existential threat. Iran\'s answer thus is based on a security rationale
that sees nuclear capacity as a defensive barrier against encirclement
and foreign intervention. But without considering Iran\'s domestic
political narratives and ideological construction, one cannot completely
grasp the reasons behind her nuclear approach. [[Iran presents]{.mark}
the [nuclear program as]{.mark} a symbol of scientific success, national
pride, and [opposition against Western hegemony.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Between reformists, conservatives, and the Revolutionary Guard, the
internal power dynamics help to further embed the nuclear debate inside
a struggle over legitimacy and national identity. Theoretical models
such constructivism and status theory help to clarify how Iran\'s quest
for international recognition and a sovereign technological identity
supports its will to keep its nuclear course. This paper also looks at
Iran\'s nuclear posture in view of its strategic hegemony ambitions for
a region. Iran wants to establish itself as an indispensable regional
actor by increasing its influence in regional theaters, including Syria,
Iraq, and Lebanon, and by diplomatic assertiveness in JCPOA
negotiations. In this regard, the nuclear program serves as both a 4
diplomatic tool and a deterrent, supporting Iran\'s strategic depth in
hostile surroundings. This study intends to provide a complete and
multidimensional picture of Iran\'s nuclear path by including
neorealism, detergent theory, constructivist models, and status-seeking
frameworks. It refutes oversimplified characterizations of Iranian
policy as aggressive or illogical and instead presents the nuclear issue
as a rational, ideologically reinforced, geopolitically located tactic.
By doing this, the study advances knowledge of Middle Eastern nuclear
politics as well as the strategic behavior of states negotiating
regional instability and worldwide power hierarchies. 2. Main Questions
of the Research • How do strategic security concerns, including
historical experiences and regional rivalries, shape Iran's pursuit of a
nuclear program? • To what extent does Iran's nuclear policy reflect its
ambition for regional hegemonic power, and how is this influenced by
international diplomacy and the global nonproliferation regime? 3.
Literature Review The strategic motivations behind Iran's nuclear
program are best understood through the lens of nuclear hedging rather
than an outright pursuit of nuclear weapons. [[Iran]{.mark} has
[developed]{.mark} extensive [enrichment capabilities]{.mark} that
[exceed]{.mark} its [civilian]{.mark} energy [needs]{.mark}, concealed
parts of its program, and resisted full cooperation with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).]{.underline} These actions
suggest a hedging strategy that maintains the option to rapidly develop
nuclear weapons if necessary. This approach allows Tehran to project
regional power, deter adversaries, and secure diplomatic leverage while
remaining within the formal boundaries of the Nuclear NonProliferation
Treaty (NPT). By staying near the nuclear threshold, Iran complicates
international efforts to assess its true intentions, thus gaining
strategic advantages without crossing red lines (Bowen & Moran, 2015).
The hedging approach also plays a significant role in regional power
dynamics. [Iran [portrays]{.mark} its nuclear [program as a sovereign
right and]{.mark} symbol of technological progress, [reinforcing]{.mark}
its domestic [legitimacy]{.mark} and [challenging Western-dominated
nuclear norms.]{.mark}]{.underline} Frameworks such as the 5 Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) implicitly tolerate this ambiguity,
potentially encouraging similar hedging strategies by regional rivals
like Saudi Arabia. Iran\'s dual-track strategy of negotiating while
advancing technical capabilities demonstrates its intent to manage
external pressures while preserving strategic depth (Bowen & Moran,
2015; Yaphe, 2010). The security dimension of Iran's nuclear motivations
is central to analysis, which applies a gametheoretical model rooted in
Sagan's security, domestic politics, and norms framework. [Aydın argues
that [Iran's]{.mark} nuclear [ambitions]{.mark} are a rational r[esponse
to perceived existential threats]{.mark}, especially [from]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies. These fears are deeply
[rooted in]{.mark} historical [grievances]{.mark} [such as]{.mark}
Western [support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
the 1953 [U.S.-backed coup]{.mark}. This enduring [threat perception
underpins Iran's belief in]{.mark} [nuclear deterrence as essential for
survival and regime continuit]{.mark}y (Aydin, 2009).]{.underline}
Domestic political dynamics also shape Iran's nuclear policy. Internal
power struggles between reformist and conservative factions, along with
public support grounded in nationalism and scientific pride, create an
environment in which nuclear development is both politically useful and
ideologically reinforced. And it deepens this understanding by arguing
that the nuclear issue is infused with cultural and discursive
constructs of honor. For Iranian elites, defending the nuclear program
is synonymous with defending national identity and revolutionary
principles. The narrative of honor explains internal opposition to
compromise, framing negotiations such as the Paris and Geneva Agreements
as betrayals of national dignity (Aydin, 2009; Rivera, 2016). This
domestic-ideological lens is further expanded by constructivist model of
"strategic identity." Rather than viewing nuclear policy through purely
realist or liberal perspectives, Khalili presents Iran's actions as
rooted in a triad of internal political identity, regional rivalry, and
international hierarchy. He emphasizes ideational elements such as
martyrdom and resistance, which contribute to a national discourse that
prioritizes autonomy and sovereignty over material calculations. The
strategic identity model shows how Iran's revolutionary heritage and
ideological independence shape its nuclear stance as much as
conventional security concerns (Khalili, 2018). While deterrence and
prestige are prominent themes, it introduces a sociological
interpretation by linking Iran's nuclear motivations to status
frustration. [He argues that [Iran]{.mark}, despite its scientific 6 and
cultural heritage[, feels denied recognition]{.mark} on the global
stage. The [pursuit of nuclear technology]{.mark} becomes [a symbolic
route to]{.mark} re[claiming its]{.mark} rightful [place among
influential states.]{.mark}]{.underline} Unlike deterministic realist
views, Prosser posits that Iran's behavior is not inevitably aimed at
weaponization but reflects a desire for respect and inclusion. He
suggests that pathways for deescalation exist through international
recognition, status incentives, and integration into global governance
frameworks (Prosser, 2017). Iran's quest for regional hegemony as
another critical driver. Nuclear capability is viewed as a tool to
enhance Iran\'s influence in the Middle East, counterbalance
U.S.-aligned Sunni Arab states, and resist encirclement by American
military bases. Iran's historical experiences, especially during the
Iran-Iraq War, have convinced its leadership of the need for strategic
self-reliance. Nuclear development thus becomes part of a broader policy
of asserting geopolitical agency while mitigating foreign intervention
and sanctions (Mahboub, 2013; Yaphe, 2010). A nuanced assessment of
Iran's strategic ambiguity. Rather than signaling offensive intent,
Iran's nuclear posture is a deterrent mechanism born from asymmetric
regional power structures. The ambiguity strategy allows Iran to remain
within NPT limits while gaining strategic leverage. links this to
broader nuclear deterrence theory and neorealist survival logic,
emphasizing that states facing superior enemies and lacking strong
alliances naturally gravitate toward latent nuclear capabilities. He
also refutes the notion that Iran's nuclear drive is about reviving
Persian imperialism, arguing instead that its motivations are primarily
defensive and regional in nature (Mahboub, 2013)

First: The U.S. Government and the Nuclear Terror Industry

[In 1945, the U.S. government became the first country to use nuclear
weapons against civilians in [Hiroshima]{.mark} and
[Nagasaki]{.mark}.]{.underline} The American nuclear attack took the
lives of more than 100,000 innocent Japanese civilians in an instant, a
moral and humane violation unprecedented in history. [This [fundamental
event of]{.mark} American [hegemony]{.mark} had a [profound]{.mark}
impact [on]{.mark} the [world]{.mark} [order]{.mark}, establishing the
logic of "force above the law," and [Washington monopolizing]{.mark} the
means of [deterrence without being effectively monitored]{.mark}
internationally.]{.underline}

Second: U.S. Wars and Military Interventions

[From the [Korean]{.mark} War (1950-1953), the [Vietnam]{.mark} War
(1955-1975), the invasion of [Iraq]{.mark} (2003), the [war in
Afghanistan]{.mark} (2001-2021), and the [military intervention in
Iran]{.mark} in June 2025, [U.S.]{.mark} government [policy
shows]{.mark} a clear [pattern of military interventions]{.mark} that
[go beyond self-defence]{.mark} or humanitarian aid. These wars, in
essence, reflect imperialist ambitions driven by geopolitical and
economic interests, often with the expansion of war, disrupting peace
and security. Global, chaos and violence end.]{.underline}

Third: Economic Sanctions as a Tool of Hegemony

Economic sanctions are no less dangerous than military wars; they
represent a silent cold war against the people, not the regimes.
Sanctions imposed on countries such as Iran, Cuba, Syria, and Venezuela
have weakened domestic economies, increased poverty rates, and deprived
millions of people of access to medicine and food. international law and
political blackmail by a great power.

Fourth: Support for the Israeli occupation

[The unconditional [support]{.mark} of the U.S. government [for
Israel]{.mark} is one of the most [prominent]{.mark} [factors of
instability in the Middle East]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States,
through political, military, and economic support, covers up the
practices of occupation, displacement, and aggression against the
Palestinian people, and obstructs all UN initiatives aimed at a just and
comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question. This attitude has
helped fuel anger among Arab and Muslim peoples. has led many movements
to the option of armed resistance.

Few American observers---including primacy realists---are content with
the status quo. [[Presidents]{.mark} are typically torn between
frustration at the complex-ity of the region and [fear of letting
go.]{.mark}]{.underline} Ever since the Carter Doctrine of1980, denying
control of the region to the Soviet Union after British with-drawal,
most presidents attempted to impose order while limiting America's
liability. [[Ronald Reagan]{.mark}, who believed no region "presents
America with more difficult, more frustrating or more convoluted
prob-lems,"14 nevertheless [continued]{.mark} [as]{.mark} the [guarantor
of Israel]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [Gulf]{.mark} Cooperation Council
(GCC) [states]{.mark}, [oversaw]{.mark} the creation of a Middle
East-focused [US Central Command,]{.mark} and [intervened in the
Iran--Iraq War.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even the Beirut barracks bombing of
1983 led merely to a tactical shift offshore, not the abandonment of the
theater. His successor, George H. W. Bush, 9forcibly expelled Saddam
Hussein's forces from Kuwait, increased America's ground presence to
preserve the West's oil windpipe and the Gulf balance, and tried to
resolve the Israeli--Palestinian conflict, to shape what he called a
"new world order." Bill Clinton felt the limits of US authority after
meeting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Yet he maintained a
United Nations (UN) blockade and "no-fly" zone over Iraq and a policy of
"dual containment." [[George W. Bush]{.mark} ran for office promis-ing
humility abroad, yet the "Global [War on Terror]{.mark}" (GWoT),
centered on the Arab--Islamic world, was the consuming priority of his
presidency.]{.underline} [[Even reluctant presidents, such as Obama and
Trump,]{.mark} feel a "pull" to remain engaged. Both voiced frustration:
after the Libya "shitshow," Obama complained of the "Washington
playbook"15 as he attempted a grand-stra-tegic "pivot" toward Asia,
while Trump vowed to leave the "blood stained sand" of the Middle East.
16 Yet [both continued the effort to maintain US
hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Obama conducted an expanded [targeted
assassination]{.mark} program, helped [overthrow Muammar Gaddafi's
regime]{.mark} in Libya, [degraded]{.mark} the Islamic State
([ISIL]{.mark}) [with airstrikes]{.mark} and support for proxies, used
sanctions to [coerce]{.mark} the Islamic Republic of [Iran into rolling
back its nuc]{.mark}lear [program]{.mark}, and invested a billion
dollars a year in [sponsor]{.mark}ing the [Syrian
revolt.]{.mark}]{.underline} His drawdown from Iraq marked a return to
overall troop levels in the region below the largest spike during the
occupation of Iraq but well above the pre-GWoT norm.17 In his
presidency's final years, the United States main-tained bases in every
MENA country except Yemen and Iran. [In a year [when]{.mark} [critics
accused Obama of "retreat,]{.mark}"18 in the Middle East the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [implemented]{.mark} a [nuclear
agreement with Iran]{.mark}, gave approximately [\$12 billion in
aid,]{.mark} participated in the [Syrian Geneva peace talks,]{.mark}
laid out an [Israel--Palestine peace plan]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [dropped
26,171 bombs]{.mark} on six Middle Eastern countries]{.underline}. 19
[Trump]{.mark} enlarged America's footprint further and more
secretively. He increased civilian and military personnel there,20 as
well as Pentagon contractors,21 escalated a confrontation with Iran,
reinforced ties with Saudi Arabia, the Gulf monarchies, and Israel, and
bombed Syria to punish its chemical weapons use. Arms sales to the
region rose by 108%over the period of 2013--2017. 22 [Such troop
withdrawals that occur---in Afghanistan and Syria---mostly involve
redeployment to larger bases else-where in the region. The overall trend
is sustained presence.]{.underline}

Democracy and Autocracy Since 1900¶ The Varieties of Democracy Institute
(V-Dem) was founded in 2014 at the Department of Political Science at
the University of Gothenburg (Sweden) to study the changing
characteristics of national governments. V-Dem produces an annual
Democracy Report that codes regimes to study changes over time in the
strength of national democratic institutions. The V-Dem coding sorts
types of political behavior and regulation into two main categories:
*democracy* (mutual consultation and majority rule) and *autocracy* (a
small elite makes social decisions regardless of the majority[). A large
[panel of experts scores regimes]{.mark} into two levels of
[democracy]{.mark}, two levels of [autocracy]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} two
'[grey zones']{.mark} of uncertainty, and they [study how regimes have
changed since 1900]{.mark} using this scheme.¶]{.underline} The 2025
Democracy Report ([Nord et al.,

is a fascinating study of the trends of countries and averages of
regions and of the world. The codings are done by five experts per
country-year observation, using a pool of over 4200 country experts who

struggling with the Triffin dilemma ---]{.underline} the provider of the
international reserve currency cannot sustain currency convertibility
alongside control over domestic currency valuation and trade balances.
[Previous US leaders wielded monetary instruments to control inflation
and improve current account deficits.]{.underline} [Trump is now using
the blunter instruments of raising tariffs and cutting foreign aid, with
the ostensible aim of improving US export access and competitiveness.
[Trump's tariffs ring the death knell of the low- or no-tariff global
trading]{.mark} system.]{.underline} Trump's giant shove is likely to
stimulate economic initiatives among 'the rest' excluding the United
States. The ultimate decoupling may turn out to be between the United
States and the rest of the world, not just the United States and China.

Transglobal technologies will continue to break borders but geography

threat.]{.mark} East [Asia must learn to live with]{.mark} a risen
[China]{.mark} without an unreliable offshore balancer]{.underline}. The
rest of the world is a large and amorphous bunch. They can and have been
followers, pawns or sites of great power rivalry and conflict. But they
can and have also been innovators, leaders, collective action
specialists and out-of-the-box thinkers and shakers. Consider the
Non-Aligned Movement, the European and African Unions, the BRICS' New
Development Bank and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,
to name a few examples. Regions including East, South and Central Asia,
Africa, Latin America and parts of the Middle East are used to
value-diverse, dynamic and often dangerous environments. [They have had
to navigate regional and international orders not of their own making
and make their way without **neat categories of perpetual friends or
sworn enemies.**]{.underline} They may hate it, and dread the costs, but
the Global Majority is better prepared psychologically to face the
current world of relative revisionism. [At this juncture, being willing
to go beyond old assumptions and to ask different questions will help
[all countries to navigate]{.mark} the [new normal]{.mark} of an
international system dominated by [three [revisionist great
powers](https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/03/24/time-to-revise-our-idea-of-who-the-revisionist-powers-are/).]{.mark}]{.underline}
One supposedly worst-case scenario under discussion in Canberra is that
Southeast Asia falls into China's sphere of influence. Australia has
limited direct ability to prevent that development, yet it's a scenario
that's unlikely to eventuate. Fear about the potential 'loss' of
Southeast Asia is misplaced. Regional doubts about the United States are
not new. The United States has allies and firm friends but Southeast
Asia does not see it the same way as Australia --- it's regarded the
United States as neither a necessarily benign nor an altruistic hegemon.
Southeast Asian responses to Chinese power are also not conditioned
mainly by what they think about the United States. Southeast Asians
largely do not see themselves as living in a world circumscribed by two
great powers locked in rivalry. Most engage in hedging, omni-enmeshment
and complex balancing, and their conception is of a layered hierarchical
regional order. Because of China's vital role in economic production and
as a growing source of investment and consumption, the region's main
concern now is the consequence of a serious and prolonged economic
slowdown in China. This will impose a huge, additional strain upon
Southeast Asia's economic prospects on top of US-created volatility. The
Trump tariffs will compel some regional economies to manage an even
greater influx of cheaper Chinese products. Yet the major regional worry
is not centred on China's economic strength, which is viewed as good for
a region that has experience in managing the asymmetry of power with its
neighbouring giant.

Deterrence

[[Deterrence is]{.underline}]{.mark} the practice of [using [threats
to]{.mark}]{.underline} dissuade an actor from taking a certain action.
112 It often involves an effort to stop or [**[prevent an
action]{.mark}** from being taken]{.underline} rather than forcing an
action to be taken.113 Deterrence discourages states from taking
unwanted actions (in most cases, military aggression). Strategy is the
art of organizing an effort to achieve a certain outcome, often altering
an opponent\'s preferences so they align with one's liking. Deterrence
is a prime example of strategy because deterrence intends to alter an
opponent\'s actions without fighting in an effort to ensure peace,
preserve the status quo or ensure that diplomacy is the main course of
action and not war in order to conduct international affairs.114

Deterrence [intends to prevent war or]{.underline} the event of an
[unwanted action]{.underline}, not promote it **[and
[relies]{.mark}]{.underline}** almost solely **[[on]{.mark}
[capability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Simply put, unless [a
state]{.underline} is willing to gamble on a bluff, it [must have the
military capability]{.underline} to carry out [its threats [in case
deterrence fails]{.mark}]{.underline}.115 The chances of deterrence
being effective are higher if the opposing side knows that the state
issuing the threat genuinely has the military power to do so.

There are many types of deterrence theories, but the main ones that will
be highlighted here are (1) conventional deterrence and (2) nuclear
deterrence. As the term suggests, conventional deterrence is based on
threats regarding conventional weaponry.116 Nuclear deterrence, on the
other hand, is based on threats regarding the use of nuclear weapons.117
[[Conventional deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, is
[often]{.underline}times **[[exposed to
weakness]{.mark}es]{.underline}**. For example, as mentioned earlier,
despite [[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} having the military backing of
the West [in the [1960s]{.mark}]{.underline}, it was still un[able to
avoid war and suffered a **military loss**]{.underline} to its
arch-enemy, India. Even currently, conventional deterrence has flaws.

The U.S. military employed [conventional deterrence [in
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} against China for several decades by
providing Taiwan with military arms. Because Taiwan is a leading
democracy and technological powerhouse, it is a key U.S. partner in the
Indo-Pacific region and is a leading country within the global
economy.118 Since the signing of the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the
U.S. has provided Taiwan with military arms and established a military
presence in the region.119 However, the U.S. attempt at trying to
minimize and combat China's growing influence in the region has
[[not]{.mark} been [without difficulties]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since
2016, [[China]{.mark} has been pursuing a **more [aggressive
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} with regard to military activity within
the Taiwan Strait. China's [rejection of]{.underline} the claim of the
Taiwan Strait being "[international waters]{.underline}" has
[[led]{.mark} it [to]{.mark}]{.underline} flying across the Strait and
**[[provoking]{.mark} the Taiwanese and U.S. militaries]{.underline}**,
oftentimes playing war games.120 These war games include China's
deployment of naval vessels along the border, flying into Taiwanese air
space, and taunting Taiwanese and U.S. pilots in the area.121

There are a number of reasons why the U.S. is struggling with this
[conventional]{.underline} approach. First, any [support]{.underline}
the U.S. provides to Taiwan can be swiftly [countered by China due
to]{.underline} its **[[geographic proximity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
Trump administration took a strategy of military deterrence in the
Taiwan Strait by announcing the regular passage of U.S. warships through
the Strait, which the Biden administration has continued to do.122 For
example, in 2021, the U.S. called on China to cease pressure on Taiwan
and to respond by diplomatic dialogue after it sent 13 military aircraft
into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).123 The next day,
however, China sent 15 military aircraft into the ADIZ.124 Secondly, the
U.S. is limited geographically as to how many troops it is able to
provide Taiwan in a timely manner seeing as it is thousands of miles
away from the region. China, being a direct neighbour, is able to
continue its efforts with great ease and put constant pressure on
Taiwan. Although this conventional method has worked for a number of
years now, China's military capabilities continue to grow as it seeks to
increase its influence in the region. Additionally, its recent [[war
games]{.mark}]{.underline} have [brought into question]{.underline} the
**[limited abilities]{.underline}** that U.S. forces in the area are
able to provide **[for Taiwan]{.underline}**. These [weaknesses
in]{.underline} the U.S. conventional [deterrence]{.underline} approach
could have [[significant]{.underline}]{.mark} implications [[if]{.mark}
there were to be a **case of military [escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
between China and Taiwan and how efficiently the U.S. would be able to
provide support for Taiwan's defence.

[[Nuclear deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [is far
[more effective]{.mark} as]{.underline} the **[[risks]{.mark} are
[higher]{.mark}]{.underline}**. American political scientist Kenneth
Waltz makes convincing arguments as to how nuclear
[[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} can help [serve
strategic]{.underline} and defensive [purposes while]{.underline} also
crediting it toward its role in **[[promoting peace]{.mark} and
stability]{.underline}** among rival states. Waltz takes the realist
perspective (not surprising considering that he is the founder of
Neo-Realist school in International Relations) and [states
that]{.underline} the primary goal of **[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is ultimately to **[[attain secu]{.mark}rity]{.underline}**.125
Additionally, Waltz argues that the influence of nuclear weapons is
unambiguously clear. Waltz states that "the absolute qu[ality of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} sharply [sets a nuclear world **off
from**]{.underline} a **[conventional]{.underline}** one".126 Waltz
argues that in [[conventional]{.underline}]{.mark} war,
[[miscalcu]{.mark}lation]{.underline} is [[always a
given]{.underline}]{.mark} because the [decision to go to war is based
on]{.underline} the interpretation of **[data available at the
time]{.underline}** hostilities are initiated. Not only can one
incorrectly assess the capability of their forces, but also that of
their enemy.127

An [example]{.underline} of this would be [Iraq]{.underline} in 1990,
when Saddam Hussein severely miscalculated the American capability. When
Saddam invaded Kuwait, he stated that he did not fear a U.S. response
because "the American society was not willing to accept 10,000
casualties".128 Learning from their lessons in Vietnam, U.S. General H.
Norman Schwarzkopf launched an extensive air campaign which saw them
gain superiority over Saddam's forces and led to a quick victory and
minimal casualties.129 History has shown many more examples of states
miscalculating their reasons to go to war, and as Waltz argues,
predicting the results of conventional conflicts "has proved difficult"
to say the least.130

While miscalculation is always a significant risk in conventional
conflicts, [there is [no potential]{.mark}]{.underline} for such
**[[in]{.mark} a [nuclear]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}**. Waltz argues
that "the probability of major war among states having nuclear weapons
approaches zero" and is of the belief that [a war between nuclear powers
would be difficult to maintain]{.underline} at the
[conventional]{.underline} level.131 In his article, "Nuclear Myths and
Political Realities", Waltz looked at the USSR and the U.S. during the
time of the Cold War and argued that [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline}** of both countries
[[**grew**, so did]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[chance
of]{.underline}]{.mark} mutually assured destruction
([[MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}), which forced both countries to a
stalemate.132

The reason the USSR and U.S. were able to emerge from the Cold War,
having not engaged in direct military engagement with each other, was
because of the risk of mutually assured destruction from their nuclear
weapons. Due to the factor that MAD posed and either side having a
second-strike capability, there was [no realistic scenario
where]{.underline} it was convincible for [either side]{.underline} to
[emerge victorious in a]{.underline} full-scale **[nuclear
exchange]{.underline}**. As James Wirtz states, "When it comes to
nuclear deterrence, the side issuing the deterrent threat may or may not
win, but the side facing the deterrent threat is most certainly going to
lose.133 Unlike conventional weapons, nuclear weapons are so destructive
that there is no way to avoid the destructive power they pose, which, as
mentioned, is simply too high of a risk to consider. In situations of
MAD, [where both sides have]{.underline} a **[second
strike]{.underline}** capability, there results in no benefit to the
side which deployed the nuclear weapon first as both sides would be able
to inflict massive retaliatory damage.134 Therefore, nuclear weapons are
able to ensure a level of peace and stability because of their
destructive potential.

In a strategic sense, [[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [introduce a
balance]{.mark}]{.underline} between two sides. Waltz states that
"deterrence depends on what one can do, not on what one will do. What
deters is the fact that we can do as much damage to them as we choose
and they to us. The country suffering the retaliatory attack cannot
limit the damage done to it, only the retaliator can do that".135 Even
if either side were to launch an attack on the other, they would have to
consider a number of possibilities. First, [would it be [strategically
realistic]{.mark}]{.underline} to risk the safety and the lives of their
citizens for an attack on an enemy? Such a [decision would]{.underline}
ultimately **[go against the primary goal of states]{.underline}**,
which, as mentioned earlier, is [[to ensure
security]{.underline}]{.mark}.136 Second, the [[weapon]{.mark} would
[need to be accurate]{.mark}]{.underline} enough [to hit its
targets]{.underline}. The moment a weapon (of any kind) is launched, the
oppo[sing side would be notified **within minutes**]{.underline} due to
multiple global defence monitoring systems. Thirdly, if the weapon were
to go [off course]{.underline}, it could hit an unintended target and
[have severe consequences]{.underline}, whether diplomatic or
environmental. Similarly, if the weapon were to be
[intercepted]{.underline}, it would be an obvious attempt at an attack
and [cause the opposing side to **act similarly**]{.underline} in
defence. Moscow is not the only location in Russia that can fire a
nuclear warhead, and neither is Washington in the U.S.

[In addition]{.underline}, a nuclear [[attack on
one]{.underline}]{.mark} country could also be **[seen [as an attack on
another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}), there are specific
[agreements regarding]{.underline} collective [defence and
retaliation]{.underline}. Collective defence means that an attack
against one ally is considered an attack against all and is specifically
mentioned in **[[Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}** of NATO's treaty.137
Article 5 states that if a NATO ally is attacked, "all of the members of
the Alliance will consider this as an attack against all members and
[will take the actions it deems necess]{.underline}ary to assist the
Ally attacked".138 Seeing as Europe's major powers (the [U.K. and
France) are nuclear powers]{.underline} and U.S. allies,
[this]{.underline} has **[[ensured]{.mark} a level of [stability against
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. All parties are also members of the UNSC,
where their primary goal is to ensure global peace. A nuclear
confrontation is unwanted by all parties because, in a nuclear war,
there are no winners, only losers. The Cold War is arguably one of the
most successful cases of deterrence, as both sides came close to
conflict but were ultimately deterred as a nuclear conflict would have
been an unprecedented catastrophe.139 These circumstances are not unique
to the U.S. and Russia alone; [these [factors must be taken into
consideration by **all states**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Prolif Bad

#### Proliferation causes [nuclear war]{.underline}---[irrationality]{.underline}, [preparation]{.underline}, and [unique instability]{.underline} ensure it.

Jing **Ge '25** \[(Jing Ge, Florida International University, Miami,
Florida, USA.) "Nuclear Proliferation and Global Peace Threat or
Guarantee," SCIRP,
https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=141102,
3-6-2025\]

The [[U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}. has played a [pivotal]{.underline} role
[in reducing nuclear weapons]{.underline} through a combination of arms
control agreements, non-proliferation initiatives, and diplomatic
efforts aimed at fostering global security. Since the Cold War, the U.S.
has engaged in [bilateral **[treaties with
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the START series and the New
START Treaty, which have significantly reduced the number of deployed
nuclear warheads and delivery systems. Additionally, Washington has been
a leading advocate for the Treaty on the [[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark},
reinforcing global norms against the spread of nuclear weapons. U.S.-led
initiatives, such as the [[C]{.mark}ooperative [T]{.mark}hreat
[R]{.mark}eduction]{.underline} (CTR) Program, have also helped secure
and dismantle nuclear stockpiles in former Soviet states, mitigating the
risks of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. However,
[[challenges]{.mark} remain, [including]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[modernization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of nuclear arsenals, emerging
threats from [**[rogue states]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [and the
[breakdown of]{.mark} arms control [agreements]{.mark}]{.underline} due
to geopolitical tensions. While these efforts have contributed to global
stability, the [U.S. [must continue diplomatic
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} with nuclear and non-nuclear states
alike [to prevent **arms races**]{.underline} and strengthen
international security frameworks. Ultimately, its leadership in nuclear
disarmament is crucial for maintaining strategic stability and fostering
long-term global peace.

Furthermore, based on two opposing theories concerning nuclear
proliferation and non-proliferation, the study challenged Waltz's theory
about supporting nuclear proliferation, such as his nuclear peace
theory. Peace should refer to positive aspects of mutual support and
cooperation. However, Waltz gave a new meaning to the notion of peace,
that is, brought by nuclear weapons. In my view, Waltz turned "peace"
into negative peace---a [peace in the shadow of **terror**,]{.underline}
as well as the absence of conflict, which was [imposed by nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. Moreover, because of the
limitations of the deterrence strategy, nuclear proliferation
[[establishes]{.mark} a [**balance of** **terror**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the international power structure. Nowadays, nuclear weapons still
constitute a main determinant of relations between states with nuclear
weapons and states without nuclear weapons. Compared with the nuclear
states, the non-nuclear states were vulnerable in protecting their
national interests.

In sum, [any use]{.underline} of nuclear weapons by miscalculation and
malicious intentions c[an cause a **catastrophic disaster**]{.underline}
for human society, the economy, and the environment. Therefore, nuclear
[weapons cannot bring world peace]{.underline} for five reasons. First,
[[only rationa]{.mark}l]{.underline} and predictable
[[behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[make]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} work, however, [[**this is not the way
people work**, especially during war]{.underline}]{.mark}fare. Second,
from the [historical narrative]{.underline}, since 1945, nuclear weapons
[do [no]{.mark}t play a significant [role in **preventing**]{.mark}
**military [conflict]{.mark}s**]{.underline} (such as aggressing against
states with nuclear weapons) and bringing positive peace. Third, instead
of making the conflicts better, [[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [make them
worse]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the
[[Russia-Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} war [shows]{.underline} how
[[states with nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons (Russia)
**[[threaten]{.mark} the states with no nuclear]{.underline}** weapons
(Ukraine), and constrain their capacities to respond. Fourth, nuclear
[[deterrence makes]{.mark} the [use]{.mark}]{.underline} of nuclear
weapons become [[possible]{.mark}, because [states with
nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons always **[[prepare to
launch]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear weapons. At last,
[[nowadays]{.underline}]{.mark}, there are [many factors]{.underline}
that can [threaten world peace]{.underline}, such as
**[[terror]{.underline}]{.mark}**ism, **[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
change, poverty, **[[cyber-attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and human
trafficking. Although [stopping these]{.underline} activities is a
national security priority for most states, it is [[not
reasonable]{.underline}]{.mark} for them [[to use
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons to deter these threats or to compel
the states engaged in them to stop. In a nutshell, nuclear weapons
cannot be used to solve such security issues. In fact, [these
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline} can [[reinforce the instability]{.mark} in
the world [in turn]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance,
[cyber-attacks]{.underline} can **[[manipulate]{.mark} national [leaders
to launch]{.mark}]{.underline}** nuclear strikes due to misinformation
or miscalculation. Therefore, eliminating nuclear weapons can remove
potential collateral risks, and eventually bring the world positive
peace.

### AT: Hard Power Fails

#### The US needs [hard power]{.underline} and a [realist]{.underline} ideology to deter Chinese encroachment in the Indo-Pacific region.

[[The **best chance** for success in maintaining]{.mark} conventional
[**deterrence** with **China** is a **neorealist** approach with the
strategy of **denial**]{.mark} as the driving force. Additionally,
[**theory** and]{.mark} 216 [**strategy** must be coherent]{.mark} to
allow implementation. Domestic [policies]{.mark} should [involve]{.mark}
protecting **[cybersecurity]{.mark}** and **intellectual** **property**,
as well as focus on manufacturing critical supplies at home [and working
toward]{.mark} a partial **[disengagement]{.mark}** strategy [with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. The strategy of denial accounts for coercion
and persuasion because [the [focus]{.mark} is [to make it unlikely for
an adversary to]{.mark} militarily [succeed through a **hard power
attack**,]{.mark} not simply convince the adversary that the costs
outweigh the benefits. Instead, [denial]{.mark} is meant to **[prepare
for a war ensure that it does not happen.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The [need]{.mark} of the United States [to]{.mark}
**[modernize]{.mark}** its forces is immediate in terms of maintaining
conventional [deterrence]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [Indo-Pac]{.mark}ific
in the long-term. First is the modernization of the U.S.
**Navy**]{.underline}. On average, it can take up to 15 years for a
conceptualized ship to reach the water (Forecast International, 2023).
During this time, delays and stops can occur. Alongside this, "The U.S.
Navy has the highest ship turnover of any navy in the world. This is not
due to the quality of the ships built (far from it), but rather to the
high mileage wear and tear on each ship" (Forecast International, 2023).
[Such a system is not **sustainable** for growth, and therefore could
have drastic impacts on deterrent efforts in the
**Indo-Pacific.**]{.underline}

Additionally, the USMC must adapt as well. The document Force Design
2030 is a good start to the modernization of the USMC, and it follows
the direction of the 2018 NDS. [This adaptation requires a deep
[integration of the **USMC** and the U.S. Navy]{.mark} as "Such a
profound shift in missions, from inland to littoral, and from non-state
actor to peer competitor, necessarily requires substantial adjustments
in how \[the USMC\] organize\[s\], train\[s\], and equip\[s their\]
Corps]{.underline}" (USMC, 2020). Furthermore, the USAF requires
changes. Although good things have occurred recently in the USAF, such
as the planned replacement of F-15EXs for F-15C/Ds at Kadena Air Base
and 217 F-35As at Misawa Air Base, more can still be done (Hadley,
2024). In early 2024, the Department of the Air Force launched a plan
for the Reoptimization for Great Power Competition. [This plan is set to
develop people, generate readiness, project power, and develop
capabilities (USAF, 2024). According to the USAF, "[Embracing change is
not a choice; it is a necessity]{.mark}"]{.underline} (USAF, 2024).
Although there is now a well-defined plan of action, this plan needs to
be given the proper resources and urgency to come to fruition. As
revealed by the results from the case studies[, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates **[lacks]{.mark}** a sense of [**urgency** in]{.mark}
the [implementation]{.mark} of policy or strategy in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. As discussed in the case studies in Chapter
Four, [**[Japan]{.mark}** has [made]{.mark} [strides]{.mark} in a
relatively short period regarding their counterstrike capabilities. It
could be argued that the [increasing China threat, alongside]{.mark} the
implications of the [Russia-Ukraine]{.mark} war, [as well as]{.mark} the
disappointing [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [withdrawal from
Afghanistan spurred]{.mark} their [shift]{.mark} [to]{.mark}, not only
more [realism]{.mark}, but implementing a strategy of denial much more
**quickly**.]{.underline} This shift has been maintained across the
three epochs that this study analyzed. Inversely, [the United States has
struggled to maintain the same driving theory of foreign policy,
therefore also **struggling** with implementation of policy. This lack
of focus and [lack of urgency could be **catastrophic** for
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [efforts on]{.mark} conventional
[deterrence]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific region in the
long-term.]{.underline}

### AT: Retrenchment Good

#### Even perceived Retrenchment emboldens revisionist powers and sparks aggression.

[Amid the intensifying competition for supremacy in Eurasia, the 2021
[US]{.mark} and NATO force [withdrawal from Afghanistan]{.mark}
constituted [a critical juncture in international geopolitics,]{.mark}
prompting substantial shifts in both regional alignments and the broader
global balance of power. The departure not only highlighted the
limitations of Western interventionism14 but also o[pened the door for
revisionist states, such as Iran, Russia, and China, to
consolidate]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Revisionist
types of states are actors that "want to change the way the world is
ordered" and employ such changes to advance their interests. [15 For
[Iran]{.mark}, a long-standing critic of US hegemony, the withdrawal
presented [a unique opportunity to assert its regional authority]{.mark}
and [deepen]{.mark} its strategic [partnerships]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
major powers such as [China and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Following
the US withdrawal, Iran\'s rapid integration into organizations such as
the SCO and BRICS is emblematic of its growing self-confidence in the
multipolar world order, as Tehran seeks to balance against Western
influence through closer alignment with its eastern counterparts.
[Simultaneously, [Russia and China,]{.mark} already deeply skeptical of
US global dominance, [perceived]{.mark} the [US retreat]{.mark} from
Afghanistan [as evidence of a declining American]{.mark} ability to
project [power]{.mark} abroad. This shift in the balance of power
[emboldened Moscow, Tehran, and Beijing]{.mark} to pursue more assertive
foreign policies. For Russia, the withdrawal provided strategic latitude
to advance its geopolitical objectives, particularly in Eastern Europe.
The subsequent Russian military [intervention in Ukraine]{.mark} in 2022
was a direct challenge to the Western dominated unipolar international
system.]{.underline} This operation, often framed as an effort to
protect Russian-speaking populations and counter NATO encroachment, was
a critical step in Moscow's broader strategy of reshaping the global
order by undermining US influence in key regions[. The war in Ukraine
has become a [litmus test for Russia's ability to resist Western
sanctions, military pressure, and economic isolation]{.mark}
[while]{.mark} simultaneously [solidifying its role]{.mark} as a key
player [in]{.mark} [the]{.mark} emerging [multipolar
world]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 This became increasingly evident following
Trump's ascension to office in 2025. Likewise, China interpreted the US
withdrawal as a signal of shifting global power dynamics. [The perceived
American [retrenchment]{.mark} from Eurasian [affairs encouraged Beijing
to pursue its BRI]{.mark} with renewed vigor, seeking to establish
economic and strategic footholds across Central Asia and the Middle
East. The convergence of interests between China and Russia, both of
whom aim to challenge the US-led international system, [emphasizes the
growing multipolarity]{.mark} in global affairs.]{.underline} This
collaboration has been particularly visible in the energy and military
domains, as Moscow and Beijing have increasingly coordinated their
policies to counterbalance Western influence. The Ukrainian war also had
profound implications for Iran[. As a revisionist state that has long
resisted Western pressure, [Iran views]{.mark} the [weakening]{.mark} of
US [influence]{.mark} and the emergence of a more fragmented global
system as an [opportunity]{.mark} to assert itself both regionally and
globally]{.underline}. Its Seyidbayli: U.S. Withdrawal from Afghanistan
and Realignment of Eurasian Riva Produced by The Berkeley Electronic
Press, 2025 220 deepening relationship with Russia and China has allowed
Tehran to circumvent US-led sanctions regimes, enabling it to bolster
its economic resilience and expand its diplomatic reach. Iran's
increasing participation in multilateral organizations, such as the SCO
and BRICS, signifies a strategic recalibration that seeks to align its
foreign policy with the shifting global power dynamics. 17 [In sum, the
[US withdrawal]{.mark} from Afghanistan has catalyzed a broader
realignment of power in the international system[, empowering
revisionist and determined states,]{.mark} such as Iran, Russia, and
China, to [challenge the once-dominant unipolarity]{.mark} of the
post-Cold War order. The war in Ukraine has further accelerated this
process, offering Russia an opportunity to consolidate its influence and
signaling the emergence of a multipolar world in which multiple centers
of power compete for dominance.18 The withdrawal also contributed to
[the rising perception that the US is weak,]{.mark} emboldening Russia
to invade Ukraine, and raising concerns that such a norm could
[encourage China to attempt a]{.mark} military [move on
Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline} As these dynamics unfold, the global order
remains in flux, marked by uncertainty and the rising influence of
non-Western powers, prompting the three actors to gravitate toward the
Eurasian axis.19

## AT: ADV CPs

### V N D Fails

#### VNC guarantees instant nuclear war, and won't lead to disarmament 

**Wellen 11** \[Russ Wellen, Editor of Focal Points (the Foreign Policy
in Focus blog) and "Nukes and Other WMDs" desk editor at The Faster
Times; longtime FPIF contributor on nuclear policy and disarmament;
described as a student of the metaphysics of nuclear weapons, 4-20-2011,
"Could 'Virtual Deterrence' Actually Increase the Chances of Nuclear
War?," Foreign Policy in Focus,
<https://fpif.org/could_virtual_deterrence_actually_increase_the_chances_of_nuclear_war/>,
SHCP AB\]

We'll return now to how virtual deterrence can make us less safe. In his
talk, Christopher Ford cites nuclear strategist Thomas Schelling, who
expressed a concern that, if nuclear weapons are de-mobilized

. . [. "every responsible [government]{.mark} must [consider]{.mark}
that [other]{.mark} responsible [governments]{.mark} will
[mobilize]{.mark} their nuclear [weapons]{.mark} base [as soon as war
erupts, or]{.mark} as soon as war appears [likely]{.mark}."]{.underline}
As a result, "there will be at least covert frantic efforts . . . to
acquire deliverable nuclear weapons as rapidly as possible." [Worse yet,
there [might be incentives]{.mark} for the country that acquired nuclear
weapons first actually [to **use **them preemptively]{.mark}. . . .
employing a temporary monopoly upon nuclear weaponry. . . . [in order to
halt its opponent's]{.mark} analogous [rush toward]{.mark} nuclear
[armament.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In short, Schelling

. . . suggests that a world without nuclear weapons would become one in
which many countries "would have hair-trigger mobilization plans to
rebuild nuclear weapons. . . . [The [urge to preempt]{.mark} would
[dominate]{.mark}; whoever gets the first few weapons will coerce or
preempt. It would be [a nervous world."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Hawks and realpolitikers both discount disarmament because the road to
it is filled with potholes or, if it were a healthcare policy, gaps in
coverage. But, even if one believes that proceeding down that path is
more of a risk than retaining nuclear weapons, the balance of power that
deterrence supposedly affords is an illusion. [[States]{.mark} that
aspire to nuclear weapons aside, some that possess them, such as North
Korea, Pakistan, and perhaps Israel, [haven't given up]{.mark} the
notion [that they're]{.mark} just as [essential for]{.mark} their
[offensive]{.mark}, first-strike capability than for
deterrence.]{.underline}

#### Virtual nuclear deterrence fails

**Ichimasa, '11** (Sukeyuki Ichimasa is the head of the Policy Studies
Department, Cyber Security Division at the National Institute of Defense
Studies); The Concept of Virtual Nuclear Arsenals and "a World without
Nuclear Weapons"; Boei Kenkyusyo Kiyo (NIDS Security Studies), Vol. 14,
No. 1, December 2011 - [GL]{.mark}

[As noted, a variety of approaches have been argued with regard to the
deterrence inherent in [the concept of virtual nuclear arsenals]{.mark}.
However, it should be noted once again that the concept's "weaponless
deterrence" dimension [has drawn fierce criticisms from]{.mark}
supporters of nuclear deterrence and strategy [scholars]{.mark}. In
particular, [the criticism]{.mark}, which is along the same lines of the
criticism of minimum deterrence, i.e., 46 [that the concept of virtual
nuclear arsenals lacks credibility about the use of nuclear
weapons]{.mark} --- a major premise of the concept --- [and cannot
constitute an effective nuclear deterrence]{.mark},47 must be
considered]{.underline}. Kenneth Waltz says he cannot support the
concept of virtual nuclear arsenals. He reasons that virtual nuclear
arsenals are equivalent to deterrence without second strike capability,
[and]{.mark} [notes [the unstableness]{.mark} inherent [in the system of
virtual nuclear arsenals, i.e., the dangers of deterring by mutual
monitoring]{.mark} and reconstruction of nuclear arsenals.
48]{.underline} Colin Gray makes the case that it is difficult to
conceive that nuclear deterrence would be realized, arguing that: [the
concept of [virtual nuclear arsenals will]{.mark} likely [lead to an
end]{.mark} result that is disproportionate [to today's power
distribution]{.mark} for the five nuclear weapon states and other
de-facto nuclear weapon states; [the delayed response]{.mark} that is a
given condition of the mechanism [of reconstructing nuclear arsenals
will favor non-compliant states both politically and militarily; and
**no state would deem that a state is a "nuclear weapon state"**]{.mark}
because it retained nuclear weapons which are actually
non-operational]{.underline}.49 According to Michael Wheeler,
[[dismantled nuclear arsenals are more vulnerable to attacks]{.mark}
than nuclear arsenals that are operationally deployed; hence, [it is
difficult to deem them as an effective deterrent]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Wheeler also criticizes that considering that even in today's world[,
[the]{.mark} building and [maintenance of nuclear arsenals requires
specialized, large-scale infra]{.mark}structure, [including]{.mark}
means of [delivery]{.mark} of nuclear warheads, targeting systems,
[recon]{.mark}naissance systems, [comm]{.mark}unication[s]{.mark}
systems, procurement systems, and logistics support systems, [the
reconstruction]{.mark} of nuclear arsenals [under]{.mark} a [virtual
nuclear arsenal]{.mark} regime [is equivalent to **developing nuclear
arsenals from scratch**]{.mark} and will prove to be
futile.]{.underline}50 George Perkovich and James Acton et al. contend
that [the [monitoring and inspection of dismantled]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenals would]{.mark} increase the [risk]{.mark}s of inappropriate
[leakage of the storage facilities' location, which would bring on
a]{.mark} [preemptive first strike by the enemy]{.mark} and accordingly
cause a destabilization of deterrence]{.underline}.51As such, from the
perspective of the conventional theory of nuclear deterrence which has
extended from the Cold War era, there is no way of getting around saying
[that **[the concept of virtual nuclear arsenals is in an extremely
insufficient and unstable situation]{.mark}.**]{.underline} On the other
hand, however, if the concept of virtual nuclear arsenals is redefined
as being in a transition phase toward "a worldwithout nuclear weapons,"
perhaps it would be possible to find subtle inter-linkages between the
theories of deterrence and nuclear disarmament. In light of the above
awareness, the next section will examine the relationship between the
concept of virtual nuclear arsenals and nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation.

[The U.S. [extended]{.mark} nuclear [deterrent]{.mark} is [underpinned
by]{.mark} the deterrent threat option to escalate to nuclear [first
use]{.mark} in the event of otherwise unstoppable aggression against an
ally. ]{.underline} For decades, major allies have testified as to the
critical importance they attach to this nuclear escalation threat behind
the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent.  [It is a [key]{.mark} reason,
[allies insist]{.mark}, that they are able to stand back from pursuing
their own national possession of nuclear weapons---and thus a key to
U.S. nuclear non-proliferation goals.  It is no overstatement to
conclude that, for decades, the U.S. extended deterrent, including the
nuclear escalation option, have been essential [to]{.mark} the cohesion
of U.S. [alliances and]{.mark} the relative success of nuclear
[non-proliferation.]{.mark}\[1\]]{.underline}

[Episodic U.S. initiatives to move to no first use (NFU) or "sole
purpose" nuclear weapon policies---that would preclude U.S. nuclear
employment in response to anything other than an opponent's nuclear
attack---would directly [contradict]{.mark} the traditional U.S.
extended nuclear deterrent [commitment to allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}
These initiatives are a prime example of how the U.S. pursuit of arms
control goals can unintentionally undermine the keys to alliance
cohesion---extended nuclear deterrence and the assurance of allies.
[U.S. allies have [consistently expressed]{.mark} sharp, substantive
[opposition to U.S. proposals for]{.mark} an [NFU]{.mark} or "sole
purpose" nuclear policy---two different titles for essentially the same
policy constraint on U.S. deterrent strategies, i.e., precluding a U.S.
nuclear response to an opponent's non-nuclear attack, including an
opponent's chemical or biological weapons (CBW)
attack.\[2\]]{.underline}

Despite this consistent, enduring allied opposition and a deteriorating
national security environment, recent U.S. presidential administrations
continue to signal their enthusiasm for an NFU or "sole purpose" policy
in an effort to showcase their commitment to reducing the number and
role of nuclear weapons.  For example, coincident with Secretary of
State Antony Blinken's most recent three-day visit in China, Assistant
Secretary of State Mallory Stewart reportedly declared with seeming
enthusiasm that the United States "is open to considering a proposal by
China that nuclear weapons states negotiate a treaty on the no-first use
(NFU) of nuclear weapons."\[3\] This renewed signaling by the Biden
Administration of interest in NFU is only the latest in Washington's
expressions of interest in an NFU policy, and will likely again be
followed by strong allied pushback. This cycle has been repeated
numerous times over the past five decades.  As a recent academic study
of the subject rightly concluded, "The question of whether the United
States should adopt an NFU pledge has arisen repeatedly in debates of
declaratory policy and is likely to recur..."\[4\]

Various administrations' efforts to move toward an NFU policy in
contradiction of the U.S. nuclear umbrella for allies typically have
been supported by some members of Congress who have proposed laws
articulating their own version of the NFU or "sole purpose"
policy.\[5\] Washington's continuing initiatives to adopt such an arms
control policy that allies expressly and repeatedly oppose, based on
their serious and understandable concerns about its degrading effect on
the credibility of the U.S. extended deterrent, contribute to growing
allied questioning of U.S. credibility as a guarantor of their security.

Ironically, perhaps, Washington's numerous arms control forays toward an
NFU policy contribute to allied doubts about extended deterrence and
undermine U.S. efforts to assure allies regarding their security
position. In short, Washington's repeated moves in the direction of an
NFU policy fan allied fears about U.S. extended deterrence credibility
that, in turn, undermine U.S. efforts to sustain allied cohesion and
non-proliferation goals. Rather than recognizing this problem and
finally curtailing its initiatives to advance an NFU policy, or spending
the enormous resources needed to provide a plausible alternative to the
traditional U.S. nuclear escalation threat backstopping extended
deterrence, Washington continually disturbs allies with its repeated NFU
forays---only to stand back following equally-repeated allied pushback.

**Allied Opposition to NFU**

[Allied [opposition]{.mark} to NFU and "sole purpose" policies is
[based]{.mark} largely [on]{.mark} understandable [fears that, at a time
of]{.mark} increasing [regional threats]{.mark} to their security, U.S.
[adoption]{.mark} of such policies would [undermine]{.mark} the
[credibility of extended nuclear deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[6\] 
This fear is almost certain to be accurate in plausible
circumstances.\[7\]  Yet, U.S. administrations have repeatedly expressed
interest in implementing NFU or "sole purpose" policies---raising
questions among allies about U.S. intentions and the continuing
credibility of the U.S. extended deterrent---and thus undermining needed
alliance cohesion and expanding the potential for nuclear proliferation.
[By continuing to pursue [NFU]{.mark} or "sole purpose" policies despite
consistent allied objections, Washington [contributes to allied
uncertainty regarding]{.mark} the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence
and to their [security]{.mark}, and thereby [contributes to]{.mark} the
very allied doubts and associated [proliferation]{.mark} problem
Washington seeks to avoid in the first place.]{.underline}

Washington should keep in mind the guidance that former Defense
Secretaries William Perry and James Schlesinger offered pertaining to
allied concerns regarding U.S. nuclear policy choices. Secretary
Schlesinger advised:  "[It is [important]{.mark} for us [to pay
attention to]{.mark} their \[[allied\] concern]{.mark} and not to judge
whether deterrence is effective by our standards, but we have to take
their standards into account as well."\[8\] Secretary Perry went on to
argue that "the failure to do this, as suggested by Dr. Schlesinger, the
[failure]{.mark} to do this [will be that]{.mark} those [nations]{.mark}
will feel that they have to provide their own deterrence---in other
words, they will have to provide their own [nuclear weapons]{.mark}. So
that will lead to a failure of \[non\]proliferation."\[9\]]{.underline}

[Alliance dissolution and the consequent likely cascade of nuclear
proliferation [would be a major blow to U.S. national security]{.mark}
and non-proliferation goals.]{.underline} Yet, by periodically floating
NFU policies that are anathema to allied perceptions of extended
deterrence and assurance requirements, Washington continues to fan the
prospects for alliance dissolution and a cascade of nuclear
proliferation. This ongoing problem is wholly avoidable if only
Washington would recognize the implications this arms control aspiration
holds for extended deterrence credibility---and its corresponding
potential effect on alliance cohesion and proliferation incentives.

Reality: [[Adopting a No First Use policy will not reduce the United
States' commitment to extended deterrence**. Extended deterrence is
about much more than just nuclear weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Forward deployments of [[U.S. conventional forces paired with]{.mark}
strong and unwavering [political commitments play the most immediate
roles in deterring aggression]{.mark} against the United States and its
allies. [The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [maintains
thousands of troops and hundreds of ships]{.mark} in commands [around
the world to]{.mark} balance crisis zones and [deter aggression]{.mark}.
The United States employs advanced conventional capabilities including
[intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tools and
precision-guided weapons]{.mark} in conflicts, but also to [help deter
potential attacks]{.mark}. The United States' robust conventional forces
are more than sufficient to deter or counter non-nuclear attacks on U.S.
allies, and conventional military threats are more credible than threats
to use nuclear weapons first.]{.underline} Current and former military
officials have emphasized the crucial role that U.S. conventional forces
play in projecting power globally and credibly deterring aggression.
[[The credible U.S. second-strike capability]{.mark} is and [will remain
a deterrent to nuclear attack, but the **threat of nuclear preemption
is** ]{.mark}unnecessary and **[dangerous]{.mark}**. [If]{.mark}
nuclear-armed [adversaries believe]{.mark} [that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [would use nuclear weapons first, they will]{.mark} be
incentivized to [use their nuclear weapons before]{.mark} a devastating
U.S. strike degrades the capability. [This]{.mark} dynamic [is
destabilizing and increases the chance of a nuclear
miscalc]{.mark}ulation.]{.underline} Maintaining extended deterrence
guarantees requires consistent communication and coordination. Any
change to U.S. declaratory policy should be made after consultation with
allies about why this change is in our collective security interest.

### NFU, Say No

#### [SAY NO]{.underline}. Even if the counterplan is a [good idea]{.underline}, the US is [empirically opposed]{.underline} to it.

For their part, [[**US officials are likely to be skeptical** of
a]{.mark} joint [**no-first-strategic attacks commitment**, much as they
have been of **China's no-first-use of nuclear weapons
policy.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Skepticism of nuclear no-first-use
largely **r[ejected an assumption]{.underline}** [that China's policy
was rhetoric and could be rapidly changed in extremis.]{.underline}
However, one result of the earlier semi-official US--China Track 1.5
dialogue was the recognition by American participants that
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [no-first-use [policy **significantly
impacted**]{.mark} China's nuclear force [posture
choices]{.mark}]{.underline}. Subsumed under a no-first-strategic
attacks commitment, [it **[could be expected to continue to do
so.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[In turn]{.underline}**, the credibility of
no-first-strategic-attacks would be shaped by Chinese actions, including
[**restraints** on its testing of options]{.underline} for space and
cyberspace operations against NC3 discussed below. [[There]{.mark} also
[**could be opposition** to]{.mark} a joint [US--China
no-first-]{.mark}strategic-[attacks commitment from **US allies in
Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}on the grounds that [deterrence
would be weakened.]{.underline} [That [concern has been another source
of American **reluctance to enunciate a
no-first-use**]{.underline}]{.mark} of nuclear weapons policy, whether
unilaterally or otherwise. However, allies' opposition could be muted by
the fact that in a mutual US--China no-first-strategic-attacks
commitment, US strategic options would not be constrained vis-à-vis
North Korea.

**Bureaucratic obstacles.** Beyond Chinese attitudes, a more practical
reason as to [**why [hotlines don't work]{.mark} with China may have
[to]{.mark} [do]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [structure]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
the [communications]{.mark} links themselves.**]{.underline} First,
[[hotline problems are in part the result of bureaucratic and
organizational obstacles in the Chinese
party-state]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Sometimes](https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/journals/twq/v31i1/0000371.pdf) those
political officials who are "authorized" to communicate via the DTL do
not have clear visibility into the movements of Chinese military forces,
and those military officials who have knowledge of the situation on the
battlefield are not authorized to speak. Despite [attempts to

the [military]{.mark} likely [worsen]{.mark} these
[problems]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Zhao explained to me,
["\[[Chinese]{.mark}\] [military]{.mark} [officials]{.mark}
[feel]{.mark} even [less]{.mark} [comfortable]{.mark} [picking]{.mark}
[up]{.mark} the phone [and]{.mark} [talking]{.mark} [with]{.mark} their
[American]{.mark} counterparts [without]{.mark} first
[consulting]{.mark} the [political leadership and receiving]{.mark}
explicit [approval]{.mark} and guidance."]{.underline} However,
[[organizational hurdles to crisis communications exist not just on the
Chinese side]{.mark}.]{.underline} [US-China crisis communications
channels have [structural features]{.mark} that simply [make them
unsuitable as "true" hotlines]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to Morris,
"[[mechanical]{.mark}ly, there is a [misperception]{.mark} out
there]{.underline}, about there being a direct line" between the two
countries that is analogous to the DCL between the United States and
Russia. But current US-China military-to-military links may be
structured closer to a game of "phone tag" in which the two sides have
to communicate back and forth asynchronously before even getting on the
phone. When someone at the Pentagon wants to communicate with their
Chinese counterparts about an incident, they first must use the DTL to
let those counterparts know "there's an incident and we'd like to talk,"
Morris told me. This initial contact can include a variety of formal
questions, such as "Which level of official do you expect to talk to?"
or "What's the alternative official that you expect to talk with if your
primary official is not available?" Zhao added. Second, the Chinese side
must send a message to agree to discuss the incident. Third, both
parties must schedule a time to talk. [Then, finally, the
[parties]{.mark} can [discuss]{.mark} the [crisis]{.mark}---though, of
course, [not]{.mark} [without]{.mark} the [Chinese military leadership
first running everything by the party bureaucracy.]{.mark}
Unfortunately, **[no]{.mark} [part]{.mark} [of]{.mark} this
[process]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [fast]{.mark} [enough]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[rapid]{.mark} [de-escalation in a crisis.]{.mark}** The fact that the

minutes]{.mark}](https://thebulletin.org/2024/04/an-interview-with-annie-jacobsen-author-of-nuclear-war-a-scenario/)[.]{.underline}
Morris explained that the same onerous process applies to the
Beijing-Washington presidential hotline. Even though these links are
generously called "hotlines," in practice, they are more similar to
communication through the slower and more routine [National and Nuclear
Risk Reduction
Center](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-arms-control-and-international-security-affairs/bureau-of-arms-control-deterrence-and-stability/nuclear-risk-reduction-center/)---a

#### HOTLINE SURVAVABLITY IS AT 0% AND TURNS IMPACTS BY RUINING TECH AND MAKING INEVITABLE WAR HARDER FOR THE US

**Hotline survivability.** In a major crisis, even if US and Chinese
military leaders were to somehow manage to establish communication, [the
[channels]{.mark} themselves may [fail if war]{.mark} were to [break
out]{.mark}.]{.underline} Over the years, some defense analysts have
pointed out the glaring omission of state-to-state communication systems
in the effort to harden nuclear command, control, and communications
infrastructure. In 1987, Ash Carter, then a Harvard
professor, [explained](https://securityandtechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/synthesis_report_last_chance_final_report_IST.pdf) that
"some thought needs to be given to communications between the
superpowers, since terminating a nuclear war before it escalates to
all-out exchanges is a goal of US strategy." Carter concluded that,
"\[f\]or the existing Washington-Moscow hotline to have a chance at
functioning in a nuclear war, both sides would have to withhold attack
on national capitals." Others have [publicly
agreed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/424385) that the hotline "[is [not
a survivable link]{.mark} and will [not be available for general nuclear
war termination communications"]{.mark} and that "[despite the system's
critical importance for war termination, no special measures have been
taken to protect it from the collateral effects of a nuclear
exchange."]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, a [**[hotline's most valuable
function resides in its availability, even---or especially---after
hostilities have already broken out]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Chief
commanders and officials need to be able to talk to each other in order
to limit a war and find routes to quickly end the war and negotiate a
peace---[before the war escalates
further](https://www.founderspledge.com/research/philanthropy-to-the-right-of-boom) to
a suicidal all-out thermonuclear exchange. As Acton put it, "perhaps the
even more important application for hotlines \[is\] being able to
communicate and try and find a formula for ending the hostilities." At
least some elements of hotline infrastructure may be able to survive a
war. For example, DCL terminals are [known to
exist](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/hotline/) not only at the
Pentagon and the White House, but also at the National Military Command
Center located inside the [Raven Rock Mountain
Complex](https://whitehouse.gov1.info/raven-rock/), a massive
underground nuclear shelter in Pennsylvania from which surviving
elements of the US government would conduct a nuclear war. Experts,
however, still believe that the government is neglecting hotline
survivability. A 2020 report by the California-based Institute for
Security and
Technology [stated](https://securityandtechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/synthesis_report_last_chance_final_report_IST.pdf) that
"adversaries may not have a trustworthy means to communicate to avoid
nuclear cataclysm." The institute's chief executive officer, Philip
Reiner, who served on the National Security Council and in the Defense
Department, explained that nuclear command, control, and communications
survivability has predominantly been first to "make sure that the EAM
\[the Emergency Action Message that directs nuclear attack\] gets
through." Communicating with an adversary, on the other hand, is "always
an afterthought." The problem of [[hotline survivability]{.mark}---a
highly technical topic that can [fall into the bureaucratic cracks
between defense and diplomacy]{.mark}---might not even cross the minds
of most decision-makers.]{.underline} For Acton, "it would not for one
second occur to [national [leaders]{.mark} to [worry]{.mark}
[about]{.mark} the [fragility]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[hotline]{.mark}."]{.underline} When asked about the survivability of
the US-China DTL, Morris told me that this question "quickly gets into
classified, sensitive information," adding that after a nuclear
detonation, state-to-state communications may become extremely
challenging. After this point, he said, "you really can't say with
certainty that we would be able to talk. All bets are off." Despite the
lack of publicly-available information on nuclear communications
infrastructure, there are [reasons to suspect current hotlines would not
survive long in a conflict.]{.underline} First, [[parties to a war may
target each other's military communications infrastructure---on the
ground, under sea, and over the electromagnetic spectrum---to gain a
tactical advantage on the battlefield]{.mark}**. But in doing so, they
might [disable hotlines]{.mark} that [serve for strategic stability and
that rely on the same infrastructure or simply happen to be
nearby]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Reiner explained that in the
first phase of a conflict, [[China]{.mark} would likely "[knock
out]{.mark} as much of \[[US\] communications]{.mark} capability as
possible]{.underline}." Second, [the [effects of nuclear weapons]{.mark}
(like electromagnetic pulse damage) [could]{.mark}
outright ]{.underline}[[disable
communications](https://www.brookings.edu/books/managing-nuclear-operations/)[,
especially for high-bandwidth communications]{.underline}]{.mark} [like
the videoconference capability]{.underline} that the DTL currently
relies on. (A text-only channel may be easier to protect against such
damage.). Third, [war between the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
[China]{.mark} or [Russia]{.mark} [would]{.mark} likely

[[In the United States]{.mark}, the case for greater action on climate
change is typically made on environmental grounds. But [there
are]{.mark} equally [compelling economic, geopolitical, and national
security rationales for the United States to lead]{.mark} the world on
[climate policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even those who remain skeptical of
the environmental urgency of the problem should recognize the
overwhelming strategic advantages of U.S. climate action at home and
abroad. Those who oppose greater U.S. engagement and ambition have
legitimate concerns. These concerns tend to fall into two buckets. The
first is economic: the chief worry is that global climate solutions
could put the U.S. economy at a competitive disadvantage with its
trading partners and reduce American living standards. The second set is
geopolitical: some observers wonder why the United States should reduce
its own greenhouse gas emissions if other countries won't do their part.
[But [a well-designed U.S. climate policy can replace national
vulnerabilities with major strategic opportunities]{.mark}.]{.underline}
We propose here an environmentally ambitious, economically sound, and
politically feasible plan that situates the United States at the
forefront of a clean energy future, enhances the competitiveness of U.S.
firms, and allows all Americans to benefit directly from emission
reductions. Such a plan would also speed up and strengthen the United
States' economic recovery once the immediate health concerns from the
novel coronavirus outbreak subside. AMERICA'S CARBON ADVANTAGE Consider
first the relationship between national climate policy and international
competitiveness. Contrary to the traditional perception that more action
on climate change would undermine American competitiveness, the lack of
a coherent national climate policy now poses a significant risk to U.S.
firms. [That is because the [current rules of global trade]{.mark}
effectively [subsidize carbon-intensive production overseas and prevent
the United States from reaping the economic benefits of its competitive
advantage in low-emission manufacturing]{.mark}. The chief competitors
to U.S.-based firms in China, India, [Russia]{.mark}, and other
countries generally operate under lax environmental standards and
produce goods in a more carbon-intensive manner.]{.underline} Yet they
currently pay no penalty for this. For example, China is now the world's
largest steel manufacturer, even though its average production of steel
is more than twice as carbon intensive as the United States'. A similar
pattern emerges in a variety of industries: motor vehicles, chemicals,
even solar panels and agricultural products. In each case, U.S.-based
firms compete on an unlevel playing field because the current rules of
the game put them at a competitive disadvantage. Rather than lower U.S.
climate ambitions, a better response would be to encourage U.S. trading
partners to raise their standards or penalize them for their polluting
ways. Further misconceptions exist about technology. Republicans are
right to focus on clean energy innovation as the key to reducing carbon
emissions. Yet some conservatives seem not to realize that the United
States is falling behind in the clean energy race. The innovation coming
out of U.S. universities, national labs, and businesses is impressive,
but too few of the results are being produced in the United States and
too little of it is making its way into commercial applications. Here,
too, a comparison with China is revealing. China is now the world's top
producer, exporter, and user of wind turbines, solar panels, and
batteries---the essential building blocks of a clean energy economy; the
United States is in fourth place, trailing Germany and Japan. China also
accounts for 60 percent of global electric vehicle sales, and the
country has long-range plans in place to turn itself into the global
leader in developing the fuels and cars of the future. [[The United
States cannot remain the world's foremost power if it is not also its
leading energy innovator]{.mark}. Another common misconception is that
climate action in the United States is too expensive or risks
undermining the U.S. economy.]{.underline} Thanks largely to the shale
and fracking revolution pioneered in the United States, market prices
for natural gas have fallen by 70 percent since 2008, so the cleanest
fossil fuel is now also the cheapest fossil fuel. During roughly the
same period, the cost of solar power dropped by nearly 90 percent, and
the price of wind power dropped by 70 percent. By capitalizing on
efficiency gains and replacing coal with natural gas and solar and wind
energy, the United States has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 12
percent since 2005, all while maintaining a vibrant economy. Although
the United States and its trading partners have a long way to go in
reducing emissions, a fundamental paradigm shift is occurring. Climate
action and economic growth, far from being mutually exclusive, are not
only compatible but also increasingly interdependent. The U.S. economy
has prospered in recent decades because the U.S. public and private
sectors were the first to embrace the communications and information
technology revolutions. The transition to clean energy promises equally
far-reaching economic advantages. Next generation renewables and nuclear
energy could substantially drive down the per unit cost of electricity,
just as the digital revolution drove down costs in recent decades. That
is why China is investing so heavily in these sectors. And that is why
the United States could be putting its global economic leadership
position at risk if it continues to ignore this transformation. Many
corporate leaders have already come to this realization and are pushing
for climate action, not just because their customers and shareholders
are demanding it but also because of facts on the ground that are
affecting their bottom line. The potential domestic economic toll of a
warming planet is already difficult to ignore. Greater fooding, storms,
wildfires, and droughts harm sectors as varied as real estate and
agriculture. Today, taxpayer spending on federal disaster relief is
almost ten times what it was three decades ago, after adjusting for
inflation. Climate change will exact an ever-greater toll on the U.S.
economy over the next several decades if emissions remain on their
current course. RISKS TO THE NATIONAL INTEREST [[The United States' lack
of a coherent climate strategy also threatens its national
security]{.mark} and, most important, its position and influence in the
international arena. The national security implications of climate
change are substantial.]{.underline} New research published in Nature
Communications has estimated that rising sea levels will put up to 340
million people at risk of annual fooding. China is now the world's top
producer, exporter, and user of wind turbines, solar panels, and
batteries---the essential building blocks of a clean energy economy; the
United States is in fourth place. or permanent inundation during the
next 30 years, largely in Asian megacities. The World Bank, meanwhile,
has found that increased fooding, as well as food and water insecurity,
in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia alone could
generate an additional 51 million to 118 million internal "climate
migrants" by 2050. This could profoundly destabilize countries around
the world, particularly those with poor governance. [As [water
scarcity]{.mark} gets worse, control over this vital resource [will
become a growing source of conflict]{.mark} among states. The current
tension between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Nile River foreshadows what
might come. And [the retreat of Arctic sea ice could change the balance
of power among China, Russia, and the United States]{.mark}. A
relatively ice-free Arctic would not only open vast new mineral riches
to China and Russia; it would also alter world trade routes between
Europe and East Asia. **Competition in today's multipolar world is
characterized less by direct military confrontation among great powers
and more by economic and diplomatic rivalry**]{.underline}. Seen through
this prism, the United States' lack of a long-term climate strategy
harms its ability to promote American interests on a rapidly evolving
world stage. The United States risks becoming a bystander, as a goods
overly dependent on Middle Eastern oil gives way to a new one dominated
by clean energy. The winner of the emerging clean energy race will
determine the economic and geopolitical balance of power for decades to
come. [The United States faces steep competition in this field. Russia
is one of the United States' main challengers in energy; [Moscow]{.mark}
has flooded the world with cheap oil and gas through new pipelines and
[has]{.mark} unveiled [a new generation of nuclear plants and fuel
agreements with developing countries]{.mark}. Each such investment
creates closer geopolitical relationships.]{.underline} Meanwhile, China
and India are making major investments in renewable energy technologies
(as well as coal-fred electricity). China, already a leading
manufacturer of solar and wind technology, seeks to dominate the coming
transformation in energy storage and delivery, as well. At the same
time, a lack of economic incentives to reduce carbon emissions in China,
India, and other developing countries has resulted in an uneven playing
field that forces carbon-efficient U.S. and European companies to
compete directly with rivals that have far weaker environmental
standards. The lower energy-production costs in developing countries
lure global firms away from the United States and Europe. China is
adding to the competition by promoting carbon-intensive
industrialization in other emerging economies, often powered by new coal
plants built through its **[Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline}**.
Such investments risk saddling poorer countries with rising carbon
emissions. As if that were not enough, China and other emerging
economies export their more carbon-intensive goods to the United States
in what amounts to "carbon dumping." The European Union poses a
different kind of challenge. For the past 15 years, the EU has limited
emissions through a trading system that allows companies to emit
greenhouse gases based on the number of allowances they have purchased
within a limited, or capped, marketplace. It is now dramatically
expanding its climate-related regulations and planning to tax
energy-intensive imports. The United States and the European Union
should be working together to defend their collective advantage over
more carbon-intensive competitors. Unfortunately, the regulatory burden
Europe already imposes on U.S. firms will soon increase as the EU adopts
tougher measures to combat climate change, sharpening transatlantic
rivalries and reducing the opportunities for collaboration. If
Washington wants to avoid accepting new rules imposed by other
countries, it should step up and set its own. [Specifically, [the United
States]{.mark} needs to become the global front-runner in clean energy
technologies and forge a U.S.-led climate alliance to advance its
national interest. The country [has everything to gain from positioning
itself]{.mark}, as it so often has, [at the head of the
table]{.mark}.]{.underline} CLIMATE POLICY BY DEFAULT An American-led
global energy policy must be grounded in a coherent and cost-efective
domestic climate policy. By default rather than by design, however, the
United States has a national climate policy that leaves a lot to be
desired and is clearly not getting the job done. It consists of an array
of federal climate regulations left over from previous administrations,
many of them being unwound by the current one; a variety of federal tax
credits and subsidies for both conventional and low-emission energy
sources; a patchwork of state-based climate regulations and
carbon-pricing regimes, which have proliferated in response to the
retrenchment of federal policy; and a constellation of clean energy
commitments and investments made by large companies, some of them aided
by earlier federal subsidies and research investments. These four
elements of U.S. climate policy ultimately leave all the key
stakeholders in the debate dissatisfied---whether they be
environmentalists, businesses, or voters of various political
orientations. The U.S. government has three main options for reducing
emissions: regulations, subsidies, and carbon pricing. The United States
has experimented with regulations and subsidies for many years, with
mixed results at best. Economists have long maintained that carbon
pricing, which involves placing a fee on emissions to reduce them and to
drive investment into cleaner technologies, is the fastest and most
cost-effective way to cut emissions. Several of the candidates for the
Democratic presidential primary voiced support for some form of carbon
pricing. Yet they also proposed costly regulations and massive
government expenditures that would hurt businesses and the economy.
**[Through both their rhetoric and their policies, high-profile figures
in the Democratic Party have gone out of their way to demonize the
companies that provide most of the United States' energy and that are
among the largest investors in clean technology ventures.]{.underline}**
[[Republican members]{.mark} of Congress, meanwhile, [have started to
signal that the era of climate denialism is over]{.mark}. Representative
Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, has warned that
the GOP ignores the climate issue at its own peril, and Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, recently emphasized that the
Republican Party needs climate solutions of its own. This represents a
critical infection point in the national climate debate.]{.underline}
Republicans still need to determine the cornerstone of their climate
strategy. With the regulatory approach of the table, the GOP is leaning
toward promoting clean energy innovation through tax credits and
subsidies. So far, this has mostly taken the form of incremental
proposals that do not add up to a coherent strategy. Democrats and
Republicans alike should accept the fact that neither regulations nor
subsidies alone will get the job done and that compared with carbon
pricing, these two instruments are much more expensive means of reducing
emissions, requiring higher overall taxes and defcits. In the end, it is
better to rely on the market rather than the government to determine
winners and losers. The time has come for both parties to embrace carbon
pricing, which economists and business leaders consistently point to as
the most businessfriendly and environmentally ambitious way forward.
[[The Republican Party]{.mark}, in particular, [can play a major role
in]{.mark} this transformation. As the party Americans most associate
with business innovation and free-market solutions, the GOP is well
positioned to set the terms of a cost-efective and politically [viable
climate policy breakthrough]{.mark}.]{.underline} THE WAY FORWARD In
February 2017, we outlined what came to be known as "the Baker-Shultz
Carbon Dividends Plan." Our starting premise was that Democrats and
Republicans must work together with corporate America and
environmentalists to fnd a market-based, small-government solution
capable of overcoming the primary political obstacle to carbon pricing,
the risk of harming American living standards. [Our second premise was
that in order to protect American jobs and competitiveness, [the United
States must give other leading emitters]{.mark}, such as China and
India, [a stark choice: do their fair share to reduce emissions or face
economic penalties]{.mark}]{.underline}. A broad coalition has since
joined together to turn this plan into a detailed blueprint for
bipartisan introduction, hopefully in the current Congress. This
coalition includes 19 Fortune 100 companies; three leading environmental
nongovernmental organizations; opinion leaders from across the political
spectrum; and in the energy sector alone, fve of the seven oil and gas
supermajors, the largest solar company in the United States, and three
of the nation's leading utilities. Last year, our carbon dividends
framework was also endorsed by over 3,500 U.S. economists, including the
past four chairs of the Federal Reserve, 27 Nobel laureates, and 15
former chairs of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, including
all eight former Republican chairs. The frst pillar of this approach
would be an economy-wide and revenue-neutral carbon fee. Carbon pricing
of this sort would produce faster and greater emission reductions at a
lower cost to the economy than regulations or subsidies. Studies show
that reducing greenhouse gas emissions by deploying today's most
commonly used regula tions and subsidies can cost, on average, between
\$100 and \$600 per ton. These costs are largely hidden, contributing to
the misallocation of capital. By contrast, our transparent carbon fee
would start at \$40 per ton and increase by fve percent per year above
infation. According to modeling by Resources for the Future, an American
nonproft that researches resource use and allocation, if the plan were
enacted in 2021, it would cut U.S. carbon emissions in half by 2035 from
2005 levels. If cumulative U.S. carbon emissions were not on track to
meet that objective after fve years, then our annual carbon-fee
escalator would automatically increase from its base rate of fve percent
per year to 7.5 percent per year, and then to ten percent per year if
emissions were still not on track. The best modeling indicates that it
is highly unlikely that this fee escalator would be triggered, but it is
nevertheless an essential component of our approach. The plan's second
pillar calls for returning the revenue from carbon fees directly to the
American people in the form of quarterly checks, or dividends. A family
of four would receive approximately \$2,000 per year in carbon dividends
in the frst year, an amount that would increase over time as the annual
carbon fee increased. According to a study produced by the Treasury
Department in 2017, 70 percent of U.S. families---including the least
well-of ones---would receive more, on average, in carbon dividends than
they would pay in increased energy prices. Using carrots is a much more
efective way to build long-term support than relying on sticks. These
provisions would align the economic interests of ordinary Americans with
climate progress. And they would create a positive feedback loop: the
higher the carbon fee, the lower the carbon emissions and the higher the
dividend to all Americans. Moreover, this approach would empower
individual Americans to address climate change on their own terms. It is
transparent and easy to understand, leaving decisions over energy
choices to consumers and businesses. The fee would increase gradually,
allowing people to adjust their habits. And it would incentivize
conservation rather than imposing it. By contrast, regulations often
take away people's decision-making power, handing it to far-away
bureaucratic agencies that are often unresponsive to local concerns. The
dividend would also make the plan revenue neutral. Any climate plan with
a high price tag will set of partisan debates over how to pay for the
changes and over the size of the government. By contrast, this plan
would encourage a smooth transition to a lowcarbon future by harnessing
the power of the market and incentivizing the private sector to deploy
its vast resources for innovation and investment. PRO-BUSINESS
PROVISIONS A third pillar of the plan would involve signifcantly
simplifying or eliminating regulations, which should be particularly
appealing to Republicans. In the many cases in which the carbon fee
would provide a more cost-efective policy solution, the fee should
replace current and future regulations, which would no longer be
necessary. For instance, it should supplant all current and future
federal carbon regulations that apply to stationary sources of
emissions, such as factories. Given that roughly two-thirds of U.S.
carbon emissions currently come from such sources, this regulatory
streamlining would provide signifcant benefts to businesses and the
economy. Yet this is not a blanket deregulatory agenda; for example, it
would not afect regulations covering other greenhouse gases, such as
methane, or building and appliance standards, for which a carbon price
is not as efective. The plan would ultimately give businesses the
predictability and fexibility they need to make long-term investments in
a low-carbon future. Regulatory stability and a predictable price on
carbon would spur clean technology innovation and investment by American
companies. Government research and development is, of course, important
in establishing a scientifc foundation for technological innovation, and
targeted subsidies can accelerate the pace. But a rising carbon fee is
the most powerful tool to unleash the innovative power of the private
sector. By making it proftable to reduce carbon emissions, such a fee
would incentivize businesses across the economy to take their
discoveries and use them to pioneer new clean industrial methods and
energy sources. Once a technology had proved its commercial viability,
the fee would propel its wide and rapid deployment. The fourth and fnal
pillar of this plan is a carbon tarif designed to level the
international playing feld by applying the domestic carbon price to
energy-intensive imports. This would enable the United States to fully
beneft from and leverage its competitive advantage in low-emission
manufacturing over many emerging economies. As with the carbon fee,
revenues collected from the tarif would be returned to the American
people in the form of a quarterly dividend. Our carbon dividends
solution doesn't appeal just to businesses and opinion leaders. When
ordinary Americans hear about this approach, they like it, too. A recent
survey by the research frm Luntz Global found that 66 percent of
American voters would support the plan, as would an even larger share of
voters under the age of 40 from both parties. The survey and research
company Morning Consult recently polled Americans on all four pillars of
the plan separately and found that roughly two thirds of voters support
each one. [And both of the polls found that [climate change is one of
the rare national issues on which Americans truly want a bipartisan
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}. A NEW CLIMATE ALLIANCE Climate change is
the ultimate foreign policy challenge, because any viable solution
requires all major countries to act in concert. A domestic reduction of
U.S. carbon emissions will be of limited value if other nations, such as
China--- now the world's top emitter---don't do their part. The United
States, accordingly, must complement a carbon dividends plan at home
with an international strategy that accounts for the failures of global
action so far. The most successful global environmental treaty to date
was the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone
Layer, which protected the ozone layer by phasing out the production of
chemicals responsible for its depletion. Two of us (Baker and Shultz)
played signifcant roles in negotiating that agreement, which succeeded
because it was balanced and bipartisan. As the ozone science developed
through the 1980s, so did the technological options to address it. That
gave U.S. President Ronald Reagan and contemporaries such as British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the confdence to negotiate a gradual
but binding agreement that would encourage the deployment of a
substitute class of chemicals. The approach was unanimously ratifed by
the U.S. Senate. Reagan called it a "monumental achievement." At the
time, some environmentalists criticized the deal as too modest. But
within just a few years, President George H. W. Bush was able to further
increase its ambition, again with broad bipartisan support. By contrast,
28 years of concerted international eforts---starting in Rio de Janeiro
in 1992---to negotiate an efective treaty to reduce global greenhouse
gas emissions have proved disappointing. In large part, this is due to
the far greater diplomatic challenge of convincing the leading economies
of the world to alter their fundamental energy uses, with all the
attendant geopolitical and economic consequences. The 1997 Kyoto
Protocol was unsuccessful, mostly because its binding obligations
applied only to developed countries and not developing ones, such as
China and India; it was ultimately rejected by the U.S. Senate. The 2015
Paris agreement fared better by getting all parties to the same table.
But its voluntary pledge-and-review system lacked an enforcement
mechanism. In 2017, the United States decided to withdraw from the
agreement. A new, more robust and realistic diplomatic strategy is now
needed to address climate change. The United States should use its
dominant position in the world economy, together with its extensive
network of international alliances, to persuade other countries,
particularly China and India, to do their fair share. The combination of
a domestic carbon fee and a carbon tarif can be used to encourage
Washington's closest trading partners to join a carbon customs alliance.
Such an alliance would have a harmonized carbon price
[[among]{.underline}]{.mark} its members, paired with a common trade
policy applied to countries outside the alliance. The United States'
natural partners for an alliance of this sort are Canada, the United
Kingdom, and the EU, which already have signifcant carbon-pricing
measures in place and have expressed a clear interest in carbon tarifs.
[Each may hesitate to go it alone in imposing its own individual carbon
tarif due to the risk of igniting a trade war. But given the importance
that [U.S. allies]{.mark} now attach to climate change, [there is good
reason to believe that if the United States led the way, they would
join]{.mark}.]{.underline} Together, the North American and European
economies make up nearly half of the world's GDP, giving them
considerable market infuence over other economies. That infuence could
grow even further if Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations joined the alliance.
[[The]{.mark} very [threat of being locked out of]{.mark} such [a carbon
alliance might be enough to move]{.mark} the largest emitters, including
[China and India, toward a similar regime]{.mark}.]{.underline} An
international climate alliance of this size would do more than just
shape the rules of trade governing carbon-intensive goods. It would also
partly determine which economies will dominate the energy industries of
the future. Naturally, those economies inside the coalition would have
the upper hand in any international competition. It would be in China's
strategic interest to join, rather than resist, a climate alliance whose
price of membership was harmonizing its domestic carbon price with that
of its trading partners. China is already experimenting with a domestic
carbon price, so this idea is hardly far-fetched. Beijing, after all,
would likely understand that it would enjoy greater energy security
inside such an alliance than it would outside it. In the meantime,
climate policy does not need to become another source of confict between
China and the United States. In fact, the two great powers could use
climate as a means of cooperating to bring greater prosperity to the
world. As China emerges on the world stage, both China and the United
States would do well to focus on areas of mutual beneft, even as both
sides position themselves for the future. The world faces a global
challenge of uncertain and potentially enormous consequence that is
within humanity's innovative capability to solve. Yet not a single major
power is implementing adequate solutions, because none has found a
viable political, economic, or international formula. The carbon
dividends program we propose ofers the best solution to resolve this
impasse. Domestically, it would enable environmentalists, businesses,
and political leaders to forge a lasting pact that leaves the majority
of American families economically better of. Internationally, **[only a
U.S.-led climate alliance can muster enough economic leverage to compel
China, India, and other major economies to join, face carbon tariffs, or
ultimately risk being shut out of the world's largest market. The United
States must lead the way.]{.underline}**

[- GL]{.mark}

[State climate action has never been more important[. Donald Trump's
reelection]{.mark} to the White House, and his administration's stated
intention to stall and reverse federal climate and clean energy
policies, [means it is even more imperative that states lead the way on
climate]{.mark}.]{.underline}1 [A [majority of the American
people]{.underline}]{.mark} [know that climate change is real and harms
the nation, and they [want the government to do something about
it.]{.mark}2]{.underline} And a majority support expanding access to
clean energy, rather than more fossil fuels.3 However, starting in
January, the Trump administration could work in the opposite direction.
[For years, [many state governments have demonstrated strong leadership
on climate change.]{.mark} Indeed, the Center for American Progress and
its partners have argued that [states laid a policy road map for bold
nationwide climate action]{.mark}, which informed the groundbreaking
policies advanced in the Biden-Harris administration]{.underline}.4
However, as the impacts of climate change continue to accelerate---with
deadly consequences for American communities and around the globe---and
as federal lawmakers look to take U.S. climate policy backward, more
state governments must go further in this leadership. [State governments
must enact new ambitious policies to foster even faster progress to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs, as well as to deliver
good jobs, equitable economic development, and healthier communities.
[Those states that lead on climate will lower energy costs for their
consumers and create more good jobs for their residents, as evidenced by
the states that led on climate during the first Trump
administration]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 Under the landmark Paris
Agreement, the United States is committed to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions by 50 percent to 52 percent by 2030. With the federal and
state policies enacted as of June 2024, the United States is estimated
to be on track to reduce this climate pollution by 32 percent to 43
percent below 2005 levels by 2030.6 Even without the incoming Trump
administration's problematic climate policies, this gap between the
emissions reductions needed to stabilize the climate and the emissions
cuts expected from current policy raised a call for more ambitious
action at all levels of government. In December 2024, President Biden
announced a new climate target for the United States: a 61 percent to 66
percent reduction in 2035 from 2005 levels in economywide net greenhouse
gas emissions.[7 Now, however, with the incoming Trump administration
and other policymakers who are openly hostile to climate policy
returning to the White House,8 and a federal judiciary that has already
targeted environmental protections,9 it will once again fall upon state
governments to carry the mantle of U.S. climate leadership.]{.underline}
Local governments have a critically important role to play as well[.
States are no strangers to making game-changing moves on climate.
[States created the nation's first pollution control laws and clean
energy standards and demonstrated continued climate leadership
when]{.mark} former President [Trump first tried to pull the United
States out of the Paris Agreement]{.mark}. State leadership on climate
change, justice, and jobs laid much of the groundwork for the progress
made by the federal government during the Biden-Harris
administration.10]{.underline} And state leadership continues to this
day: For example, in 2024, Vermont made history as the first state to
require the fossil fuel industry to pay for the cost of recovering from
and preparing for extreme weather events driven by climate change.11
Also, in 2024, Washington state voters overwhelmingly affirmed the
state's Climate Commitment Act, aimed at achieving a 95 percent
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury and investing
billions in community solutions.12 And in 2023, Minnesota was one of the
first states to require a comprehensive evaluation of the climate
pollution associated with new transportation infrastructure projects.[13
In many ways, [state governments are]{.mark} much [better positioned
today to continue advancing climate action than when Trump first took
office]{.mark} in 2017. The U.S. Climate Alliance---a coalition of
governors committed to continued climate progress---now boasts 24 member
governors.14 In addition, [there are now twice as many pro-clean energy
state legislatures]{.mark}.15 As 2025 begins, states must be called upon
to go further and faster by taking action on climate strategies across
every sector of their economies. [States]{.mark} that [have adopted a
robust agenda for 100 percent clean electricity]{.mark} must now do the
same for transportation and built infrastructure. States must lead the
way in industrial decarbonization and pollution reduction by supporting
clean and globally competitive U.S. manufacturing industries. And
[states must]{.mark} advance policies that deliver an equitable clean
energy transition, and [make polluters pay to clean up their
mess]{.mark}.]{.underline} This report identifies key policy
advancements that are possible in a state-focused climate action race to
the top, especially if states adopt the best-in-class climate policy
ideas of other states in the power, transportation, buildings, and
industrial sectors, as well as cross-cutting policies such as
environmental justice and workforce development needed for a
climate-ready workforce. In addition, this report also identifies
best-in-class policies for states to hold polluters accountable and to
finance an equitable clean energy transition. Key policies for specific
sectors include the following: Power sector: delivering 100 percent
clean electricity Adopt and accelerate clean electricity standards Hold
utilities accountable via public utility commissions Set energy storage
targets and promote grid-enhancing technologies Streamline clean energy
and transmission siting, permitting, and interconnection Support
community solar Transportation sector: accelerating the zero-emission
vehicle market and build-out of zero-emission transportation
infrastructure Adopt Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks
standards Set and deliver on statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction
targets Integrate climate assessment in the transportation planning
processes Invest in transit infrastructure Establish electric
vehicle-ready requirements for buildings Industry sector: supporting
clean and competitive U.S. manufacturing industries Adopt green public
procurement policies Incentivize industry to achieve emissions
reductions Establish industrial emission standards Establish methane
regulations for landfills Divert food waste from landfills Phase out
products using hydrofluorocarbons Finance conservation and climate-smart
practices in agriculture Buildings sector: reducing energy use and
pollution from buildings Adopt building performance standards Adopt
clean heat standards Adopt appliance efficiency and emission standards
Enhance clean building codes Enact state housing and land-use reforms

#### Assurance dilemmas [don't]{.underline} assume the [great-power alliance]{.underline} system.

Andris **Banka '25** \[(Andris Banka,

That said, [numerous [scholars]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[pushed
back]{.underline}]{.mark} against this reasoning and counselled
[[against]{.mark} **overstating [entrapment]{.mark}
risks**]{.underline}. After all, there are [[mitigation
strategies]{.mark} that]{.underline} great [powers can
pursue]{.underline} to minimise the likelihood of this phenomenon. One
such remedy presents itself at the alliance design stage. Here, the
record indicates that [when it comes to **potentially problematic
allies**]{.underline} located in contested regions, [the
[US]{.mark}]{.underline} government has sought to [deliberately
insert]{.underline} certain loopholes or [[**escape clauses** in]{.mark}
the [alliance contracts]{.mark}]{.underline}, just [in case]{.underline}
the 'insured' ally would one day decide to undertake [provocative moves
and]{.underline} push Washington into [an undesirable war]{.underline}.
The careful language in which security pacts are crafted thus may offer
the United States a way out of a situation where an alliance partner
seeks to pull it into a crisis of its own making.20 Indeed, a body of
scholarship demonstrates that the terms of [security
alliances]{.underline} are often purposefully spelled out with a degree
of ambiguity and conditionality, thus [[allow]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
the [involved parties]{.underline} some **[[room for
manoeuvre]{.underline}]{.mark}**.21

[Another dimension]{.underline} that could come into play [is regime
type. [Democratic nations]{.mark}]{.underline} tend to be [**[more
dependable]{.mark} alliance partners**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
security [alliances]{.underline} formed between democratic states [enjoy
[greater longevity]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 That being said, the work by
Chiba et al. further suggests that while 'democracies may be more likely
to fulfill their commitments', they are [[**more selective**
during]{.mark} the alliance [formation stage]{.mark}]{.underline},
seeking [to avoid]{.underline} obligating themselves to participate in
'[conflicts]{.underline} in which [they may not have an
interest']{.underline}.23 Probing this issue from the public opinion
angle, Justwan and Berejikian further find that
[[if]{.underline}]{.mark} a US ally, in their examined case [**[South
Korea]{.mark}**, were]{.underline} to be [the [instigat]{.mark}or
of]{.underline} a military [[crisis, this would]{.underline} somewhat
**[reduce American support]{.underline}**]{.mark} for the government in
Seoul, but only '[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} certain types of military
operations (**[cruise missile and [nuclear
strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}**) but not others'.24 The study concluded
that the US population remained largely interested in defending South
Korea, irrespective of how the conflict had originally unfolded.

Even [after the formation stage, [great powers]{.mark} have]{.underline}
some [tools]{.underline} at their disposal to rein in an overly
bellicose ally. For instance, a partner government can **[[privately
convey]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
**[[dissatisfaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** with allied behaviour,
[apply]{.underline} bilateral [[**diplomatic pressure**,
or]{.underline}]{.mark} seek to **[[publicise]{.mark} its
[complaints]{.mark}]{.underline}**.25 Another factor that may work
towards alleviating the risk of entrapment is the notion of tight
alliance relations.26 Scholars such as Press-Barnathan have advanced the
argument that 'institutionalized [channels of
communication]{.underline}, consultations, [and
[decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline} and operational
[[procedures]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[allow]{.underline}
[members]{.underline}]{.mark} in the alliance [to exert
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline} on other members, [**[to
restrain]{.mark} them** [from]{.mark}]{.underline} unilaterally pursuing
[[undesired policies']{.underline}]{.mark}.27 A similar point is put
forward by Pressman, who notes that close alliances facilitate the
exchange of information and enable close monitoring of partners, thus
ameliorating risks of alliance entrapment. In such instances,
withholding information from one's ally becomes very problematic.28
Likewise, Tierney posits that alliance ties enable 'consultation, giving
doves an opportunity to point out the pitfalls of reckless military
action and highlight alternative paths to achieving policy goals'.29

Conclusion

The United States opposes the spread of nuclear weapons, even to US
allies, for good reason. Primarily,
[[nonprolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} (1)
[[mitigates]{.underline}]{.mark} the [risks and consequences of
**[entanglement]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the United States, (2)
[[preserves]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[influence]{.mark} in
regions]{.underline} where there is a **[high risk of
conflict]{.underline}**, (3) [encourages]{.underline} allies to make
[conventional investments to deter war, and]{.underline} (4)
[[reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[risks of]{.underline}]{.mark} an
employment of **[a [nuclear]{.mark} weapon]{.underline}**. Still, the
United States should prioritize nonproliferation among other security
interests, a process that is a matter of evaluating dynamic risks and
benefits.

Extended [deterrence and [assurance]{.mark}]{.underline} have been
America's [[**most successful** means]{.mark} of achieving]{.underline}
its **[nonproliferation]{.underline}** goals. [[By assuring]{.mark}
allies]{.underline} that [[extended deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} is
credible, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[limits]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark}]{.underline}** of proliferation. But [[North
Korea's]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing military
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially the potential ability to
hold the US homeland at risk, could [[weaken
confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in US extended deterrence. As global
demands on the United States grow, [the [requirements to assure
**So**]{.mark}]{.underline}uth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea
[and]{.underline} thus [limit]{.underline} the risk of [proliferation
**[will]{.mark}**]{.underline} also probably
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} best [[manage]{.underline}]{.mark}
proliferation [risks [by improving]{.mark}]{.underline} extended
[[deterrence and assurance]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has a number of
policy, posture, and programmatic options to take, as the risks and
benefits of nonproliferation call for them. While the United States
continues to collaborate and follow through with its commitments under
the Washington Declaration, prudence requires additional US preparation.
We recommend the United States prepare to deploy or station dual-capable
aircraft and construct nuclear weapons storage facilities in South
Korea. As security on the Korean Peninsula deteriorates, the [US [needs
to get started]{.mark}]{.underline} to provide the president of the
United States this option **[in a [timely]{.mark} manner]{.underline}**.

Acceleration of Regional Instability

The [decision to pursue]{.underline} independent [[nuclear armament
reflects]{.underline}]{.mark} already **[[deteriorating]{.mark} regional
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**; however, there will be short-term
drastic changes to regional stability. Firstly, extended [deterrence
relies on]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[assuring allies]{.underline} that they will protect them using the full
range of capabilities. Perhaps there are security benefits for the
United States [if [So]{.mark}]{.underline}uth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [possessed [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} -- but their acquisition **[[prompts Japan
to reevaluate]{.underline}]{.mark}** its security guarantee. While Japan
traditionally holds conflicted views on nuclear armament45, with the
public heavily opposed, [2022]{.underline} marked a [noteworthy shift in
defense policy]{.underline}46 . [[Surrounded by]{.mark} multiple
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline} growing and [modernizing]{.underline}
their nuclear arsenals, **[[Japan]{.mark} may [follow
suit]{.mark}]{.underline}** if South Korea pursues a sovereign nuclear
deterrent, though it is unlikely.

Just months before his assassination, former Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo [Abe broke a long-standing taboo]{.underline} by signaling should
have an active debate on nuclear weapons. [Japan is]{.underline} a
"**[[nuclear hedging]{.mark}" state]{.underline}**, which preserves the
capacity to develop nuclear weapons in case the state decides to change
course on their strategic posture. [They do not face technical
obstacles]{.underline} -- in fact, they are the only nation with the
[[ability to **enrich uranium**]{.underline}]{.mark} and **[reprocess
[plutonium]{.mark}]{.underline}** that doesn't possess nuclear
weapons.47 Much like the ROK years ago, nuclear proliferation remains on
the far-right conservative fringe, and to go nuclear would require a
drastic change in Japan's security environment. But a [[nuclear ROK
gives]{.underline}]{.mark} Japanese [[conservatives]{.mark} the
[opportunity]{.mark} to call for]{.underline} a [change]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} their three **[non-nuclear principles]{.underline}**.
Japanese politicians and pundits even considering the nuclear [de[bate
already is a]{.mark}]{.underline} drastic [[reversal]{.mark},
considering Japan's history [of]{.mark}]{.underline} reinforcing
[[nonprolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration and opposition to nuclear
weapons.

The [[DPRK]{.mark} will]{.underline} certainly
[[view]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration by
the ROK, either through nuclear sharing or the creation of an
independent arsenal, [[as]{.mark} a **direct [attack]{.mark}** [on state
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2023, the DPRK enshrined nuclear
weapons into its constitution in order to deter U.S. provocations, a
year after the state also enshrined in law preemptive strikes to protect
the state. [Deterrence experts expect]{.underline} a tactical nuclear
weapons test is imminent for the DPRK48 -- [[if tensions
rise]{.underline}]{.mark} between the DPRK and ROK, [we]{.underline}
could [[expect]{.underline}]{.mark} the former to use a [**tactical
[nuclear weapon]{.mark}** [to '**escalate to
deescalate'**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Unless developed in secret or
under security provided during its transition, the [DPRK]{.underline}
could [[launch a **preventative war**]{.mark} in response]{.underline}.
Take for example, when Israel launched an attack during the final stages
of the construction of a French nuclear reactor in Iraq. The [[DPRK
lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[conventional]{.mark}
force]{.underline}s to match the US and ROK -- a [[preemptive
nuclear]{.mark} strike]{.underline} may be [**the [best chance]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} state [survival]{.mark}]{.underline} if a war were to break
out. Unfortunately, the [ROK's development]{.underline} of an
independent nuclear arsenal would be counterproductive and [make their
position less safe]{.underline} than before.

It's important to note the [magnitude of technical
disadvantages]{.underline} the ROK faces if they are [to
develop]{.underline} nuclear **[weapons to deter the
DPRK]{.underline}**, as it would be a major national undertaking. The
ROK possesses one of, if not the world's most prominent civilian nuclear
energy programs; however, a nuclear engineering professor at Seoul
National University predicts it would take roughly three years to build
the necessary infrastructure to produce the bomb.49 In undertaking this
production, their energy industry would risk losing licenses globally
and put its renowned civilian nuclear program in jeopardy. To create a
credible deterrent, the ROK would not only need a few warheads, but a
complete nuclear arsenal with at least thirty-forty warheads. Thus,
creating a nuclear weapons program makes both their security less safe
from the north, but as well as compromise significant parts of their
civilian infrastructure.

The [worst-case scenario]{.underline} for the ROK if its attempts on
nuclear proliferation push **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** to cooperate
more closely with the DPRK. China will [seek to
[reject]{.mark}]{.underline} any [[shift of power]{.mark}
that]{.underline} would **[benefit the U.S]{.underline}**. and ROK, and
[[will not sit idlily]{.underline}]{.mark} if the ROK acquired an
independent nuclear weapons program. China remains the ROK's largest
trading partner and has significant economic leverage, albeit reduced
since 2017, when China utilized that leverage to halt the normalization
of the ROK's THAAD missile-defense system. Part of [China's
calculus]{.underline} is [dependent on]{.underline} the [US
reaction]{.underline} to nuclear proliferation. China may ease on
sanctions of the ROK if they sacrifice their security alliance with the
US due to nuclear proliferation. Either both China and the US could
execute major sanctions and costs against the ROK, as the DPRK ramps
their aggressive behavior, or the ROK lose their security alliance with
Washington to expect a tolerant China. Regardless, [nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration [would]{.mark}]{.underline} substantially
**[[alter the balance of power]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region,
likely [leadi[ng to]{.mark} more [instability and]{.mark}]{.underline}
lower-level [[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

mean they want]{.mark} a **[formal declaration]{.mark}** of
independence.]{.underline} Among both the general public and political
elites, the country's understanding of independence has evolved
significantly over the last generation. [In decades past, independence
was commonly thought to require an [**unequivocal**, formal

today, such a move [is **widely seen** as
**unnecessary**.]{.mark}]{.underline} To most people, [[Taiwan is

declaring what is already the case, especially [given]{.mark} that [it

an action.]{.underline} And since [[Taiwanese politicians]{.mark} **must
[respond]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [public opinion]{.mark}]{.underline},
political [elites who support independence have **largely come** to the

quixotically challenging the status quo, [[most]{.mark} of them have

[The [PRC]{.mark} is [**unlikely** to **abandon**]{.mark} its [quest
for]{.mark} **control over [Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- what it
calls "reunification with the motherland" --- no matter who is in power
in Beijing. [The **[Qing]{.mark}** dynasty's [**loss** of Taiwan]{.mark}
to Japan in 1895, [and]{.mark} the island's [**recovery** at the end

important, to the [**legitimacy** of the]{.mark} [C]{.mark}hinese
[C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty (CCP).]{.underline} 

But to date, [[Taiwan remains **outside of**]{.mark} **Beijing's

(although not the same political party) [that **fled** the mainland when
the Chinese Communist Party took power in 1949.]{.underline} Taiwan's
[government has [survived]{.mark} for more than [**seven decades**
thanks to **security assurances** from]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} --- first in the form of a mutual security
treaty and later in the form of a political commitment without a formal
defense arrangement, embodied in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.
[Starting in 1986, [Taiwan went through]{.mark} a
**[transition]{.mark}** [to democratic rule, making it]{.mark} a **more
valuable** partner for the United States and [more challenging]{.mark}
for the CCP [to]{.mark} move toward [reunify]{.mark}ing it with the
mainland.]{.underline}

PRC rulers from Mao Zedong to Deng Xiaoping acknowledged that the
unification of Taiwan with the mainland would take a long time. [At the
same time, [CCP **leaders** and]{.mark} party **[documents]{.mark}**
have [**repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction** with]{.mark} the
**[s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} In 2002,
under Jiang Zemin's leadership, the [16th Party Congress report declared
that the "[Taiwan]{.mark} issue [cannot be postponed
**indefinitely**.]{.mark}" In 2013, President [Xi]{.mark}
Jinping [stated]{.mark} that "we [**should not** allow this problem to
be **passed down**]{.mark} from one generation to the
next."]{.underline} Xi has since [identified [unification]{.mark} as
**[essential]{.mark}** for the "**Great Rejuvenation** of the Chinese
Nation,"]{.underline} a mission to which he has linked his personal
legacy and for which he has set a [target date of 2049, the centennial
of PRC's founding.]{.underline} 

[[The PRC continues to state]{.mark} that it prefers to unify with
Taiwan through **peaceful means**, but **insists** that [it has the
**right** to]{.mark} do so by [force if Taiwan **declares
independence**]{.mark}, takes steps to establish Taiwan's **permanent
separation**, [or]{.mark} [**delays unification
indefinitely**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Article 8 of 2005 China's
Anti-Secession Law states that "In the event that the 'Taiwan
independence' secessionist forces should act under any name or by any
means to cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China, or that major
incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or that
possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely
exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary
measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

[[Beijing has]{.mark} for decades [been building up]{.mark} the
**[military]{.mark} capability** to make **credible** the military
threat to Taiwan and to any U.S. forces that **might intervene** in
Taiwan's defense.]{.underline} This includes developing what the U.S.
Department of Defense calls "**[[anti-access area
denial]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (A2AD) capabilities --- [large
inventories of Chinese **[missiles]{.mark}**,
**[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}**, military **[aircraft]{.mark}**, and
**[cyber]{.mark}** weapons [that put **at risk** U.S.]{.mark} surface
ships (including aircraft carriers), aircraft, **[military]{.mark}**
satellites [and]{.mark} American [**bases** in the Western
Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}, like those in Japan and Guam. After
Speaker Pelosi's August visit, the Chinese military sought to
demonstrate its ability to surround and squeeze the island, signaling a
potential blockade strategy that could strangle Taiwan's economy and
force the island to enter political talks on Beijing's terms.

Nuclear internal balancing is neither an aberration in the international
order nor a particularly rare occurrence. Or, at least it may not be in
the future. [[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [attempted]{.mark} to
undertake independent [proliferation]{.mark} efforts [as US
cred]{.mark}ibility [waned in the]{.mark} 19[70s]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[West [Germany]{.mark}, [Taiwan]{.mark}, and [Japan]{.mark} each
[expressed]{.mark} [the same tendency]{.mark} periodically in the
decades [after the Second World War.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nuclear
internal balancing behavior exists. [[As the heg]{.mark}emony [of the
United States]{.mark} continues to [decline]{.mark} in the twenty-first
century, we [may find more and more US allies engaging in nuclear
internal balancing]{.mark}---and perhaps with greater success than in
prior attempts. [An abandoned state has four
options]{.mark}:]{.underline} 1) to appease its adversaries; 2) to seek
guarantees from another power; 3) to join the adversary; or 4) to
construct an independent deterrent capability. [Options one and three
involve widespread concessions to the power threatening an abandoned
state. However, past state behavior indicates that [balancing is far
more likely]{.mark}.]{.underline} Options two and four represent
external and internal balancing, respectively[. An abandoned state may
not have the luxury of external balancing. [States who]{.mark} once [had
a great power ally]{.mark} would be [unlikely to find a friend in a
geopolitical enemy of that]{.mark} former great power
[ally]{.mark}.]{.underline} Say I played center for five years on the
Chicago Bears. If I decided I wanted to play for the Green Bay Packers
due to an awful quarterback, it is unlikely I would be received well by
my longtime rival. Geopolitical antagonism does not simply evaporate.
[[A bipolar geopolitical world]{.mark}, such as during the Cold War, may
[eliminate the]{.mark} possibility of [external balancing]{.mark}
entirely should a nuclear protector become unreliable or renege on its
guarantees. Such was [the case]{.mark} for one prominent ally of the
United States [during the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The
literature on abandoned states and threat response is incomplete. One
case of abandonment and subsequent internal balancing remains largely
unexamined by scholars: France. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the
government of France did not perceive the United Esperne 5 States'
nuclear 'umbrella' of extended deterrence to be credible. Lack of US
support in conventional warfighting called the commitment of the United
States to ensure French territorial sovereignty into question.7 [The
expansionist [Soviet Union,]{.mark} providing no trustworthy assurances
of restrained action to the West, certainly [gave France reason to seek
its own security guarantees.]{.mark} The [threat of US
abandonment]{.mark} was [insufficient]{.mark} to pacify France's search
for an independent deterrent. In response, [France balanced internally
through acquiring nuclear weapons]{.mark}. [Prolif]{.mark}eration was
[the most cost-effective means]{.mark} by which [France could ensure its
survival]{.mark} in the face of Soviet attack or coercion.]{.underline}
In the minds of French leaders, the United States did not signal that it
would provide a credible deterrent against Soviet aggression. [They
[perceived]{.mark} the existence of [non-credibility]{.mark},
[lead]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} the behavior of [internal
balancing.]{.mark} In this thesis, the perceived existence of
non-credible US assurances serves as an independent variable. Dependent
upon the lack of credibility is the behavior of internal
balancing]{.underline}

Economic Growth through Trade Routes and Economic Zones: Expansionist

lead to the creation of new trade agreements or partnerships that
benefit U.S. businesses and strengthen its economic leadership.

DISCUSSION

The [transition]{.underline} from a unipolar [to]{.underline} a
[[multipolar]{.mark} world **[presents]{.mark} profound
[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline} and opportunities [for]{.underline}
international [peace and security]{.underline}. The Cold War era,
characterized by a bipolar structure, offers valuable lessons for
navigating the [complexities of today's multipolar
landscape]{.underline}. Historically prevalent, [multipolarity
height[ens **uncertainty and fluidity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[allowing]{.underline}]{.mark} [states]{.underline} the [[flexibility
to]{.underline}]{.mark} pursue strategies aimed at
[**[revis]{.mark}**i]{.underline}ng **[the established
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Christensen and Snyder Citation1990).
This [shift [necessitates]{.mark}]{.underline} a [reevaluation of global
strategies]{.underline}, [emphasizing]{.underline} the importance of
strategic [restraint]{.underline}, balanced [[alliances, and diplomatic
engagement to prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} the devastating consequences
of **[[unchecked]{.mark} power [competition]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In the multipolar world, [power is increasingly dispersed]{.underline}
rather than concentrated. It complicates the process of generating
collective responses to pressing regional and global issues due to the
increased number of decision-makers involved - but is hardly impossible,
akin to the nineteenth century Concert Systems in the wake of the
Napoleonic Wars (Kegley and Raymond Citation1994). This dispersion of
power also [heightens the number and]{.underline} potential [severity of
threats]{.underline}, including those posed by [[**rogue states**,
**non-state**]{.underline}]{.mark} armed
**[[actors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and militias. [Resisting]{.underline}
the [[spread of nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} and securing
nuclear materials [becomes [paramount]{.mark}]{.underline} in such a
[fragmented landscape]{.underline} (Pearson and Simpson Citation2022;
Simpson Citation2016).

Power dynamics today are not what they once were. The traditional
concepts of compelling other states to act against their will (Guzzini
Citation2013) diminish in a multipolar world where non-state actors,
transnational organizations, and technology play significant roles.
Multiple layers of powerful actors or groups of actors, such as the G20
(Cooper 2013; Golub Citation2013) or Six-Party Talks on the DPRK (Carlin
and Lewis Citation2008), characterize the current global landscape.
Countries such as India, Brazil, and members of the EU play increasingly
significant roles on the global stage with the influence of
international organizations (Mielniczuk Citation2013).

The [lessons from]{.underline} the [Cold War provide]{.underline}
valuable [insights]{.underline} into the behavior of states in the
current multipolar world[. As the world transitions]{.underline} from
unipolarity to multipolarity, [[we observe]{.underline}]{.mark} similar
patterns in major power competition in terms of the [**strategic
[maneuvering of alliances]{.mark}** with balance of power
behavior]{.underline}, nuclear [[posturing]{.underline}]{.mark},
indirect [confrontations]{.underline} through [[proxy
contests]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} economic
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. While bipolarity was a more balanced
and restrained power dynamic, multipolarity allows actors to exert their
power **[[with]{.mark} relatively [fewer negative
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}** for disrupting the international
system. The [Russian invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}
exemplifies]{.underline} this pattern, and the [DPRK's [nuclear
tests]{.mark}]{.underline} remain as a valid concern. In this complex
environment, our analysis underscores the imperative for major powers to
exercise restraint and adopt prudent policies to prevent the
catastrophic consequences of direct conflict.

The [[inability to form]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[unified international
response]{.underline}]{.mark}** to conflicts such as the [[ongoing
wars]{.mark} in Ukraine, Syria, and Gaza]{.underline}, [as well as
the]{.underline} persistent [threat of]{.underline} nuclear
[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration and brinkmanship,
[[highlights]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[challenges]{.mark} of
multipolarity]{.underline}**. These [[situations risk]{.mark} becoming
[tinderboxes for]{.mark}]{.underline} broader
**[[conflagrations]{.underline}]{.mark}** with significant [implications
for]{.underline} regional and [[global security]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Fragmenting power [[necessitates]{.mark} **enhanced [cooperation
among]{.mark}**]{.underline} diverse **[global
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline}** to address these threats effectively. As
in certain decisions of states, this less state-centric global landscape
requires a departure from purely Realist or Liberalist perspectives and
demands a nuanced understanding of overlapping spheres of influence and
the resulting inefficiencies in global governance.Footnote7

The [stakes]{.underline} in a multipolar world [are]{.underline}
extraordinarily [high]{.underline}, with the potential for unprecedented
destruction given the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the
interconnectedness of the global community. The Cold War's legacy offers
a blueprint for [[managing]{.mark} great power [competition
through]{.mark}]{.underline} restraint, strategic **[[alliances,
and]{.mark} diplomatic [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By applying
these lessons to the contemporary multipolar landscape, we [[can work
toward]{.mark} a more **[stable]{.mark} and peaceful [international
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, avoiding the tragic outcomes that marked
previous periods of intense power rivalry. Major powers must remember
the lessons of living history and commit to policies that prioritize
peace, stability, and the well-being of humanity. If we want to avoid
the pitfalls of the twentieth century - so defined by warfare,
bloodshed, and competition - in the twenty first century, scholars and
policy makers alike must promote restrained and cautious foreign
policies, lest we repeat the mistakes of the past.
