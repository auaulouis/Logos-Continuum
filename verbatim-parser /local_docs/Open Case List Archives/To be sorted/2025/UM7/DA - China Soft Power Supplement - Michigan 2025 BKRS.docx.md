**[[China]{.mark} has surpassed the United Kingdom to [become]{.mark}
the [second most]{.mark} influential [s]{.mark}oft [p]{.mark}ower
[nation]{.mark}, according to the 2025 Brand Finance Global Soft Power
Index released today]{.underline}**. The latest ranking
**[[marks]{.mark} a significant [shift]{.mark} in global influence,
[reinforcing China's]{.mark} growing [ability to shape]{.mark}
[international]{.mark} perceptions through [tech]{.mark}nology,
[business]{.mark}, and [culture]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The annual index, **[based on a survey of more than 170,000 respondents
across 100 countries]{.underline}**, highlights China's rising status
across multiple dimensions. **[[Economic]{.mark} [diplomacy]{.mark},
[tech]{.mark}nology leadership, and the global [expansion of Chinese
brands]{.mark} have [propelled]{.mark} the [country to]{.mark} an
[all-time high]{.mark} soft power]{.underline}** score of 72.8 out of
100.

While the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates retained the top position,
its [declining reputation]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- driven by political
instability and governance concerns under President Donald Trump's
second term --- signals mounting challenges for U.S. influence. The
United Kingdom's fall to third place underscores stagnation in its
business and governance metrics, contrasting with **[[China's]{.mark}
deliberate [efforts]{.mark} to [enhance]{.mark} its [global
standing]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

David Haigh, Chairman of Brand Finance, attributes **[[China's]{.mark}
rise to its sustained [investments in economic]{.mark} attractiveness,
[cultural]{.mark} engagement, [and]{.mark} [governance
stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** He points to China's
**[[growing]{.mark} [rep]{.mark}utation [for]{.mark}
[sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, its expanding influence in the
luxury and technology sectors, and its positioning as an increasingly
trusted international partner.

Although China has been recognized as an economic powerhouse for
decades, its ability to shape global culture and consumer behavior
remains an open question.

The country's entertainment sector has made significant strides,
evidenced by the box office success of Nezha 2. The animated sequel
recently overtook Pixar's Inside Out 2 to become the highest-grossing
animated film globally, earning \$1.69 billion. However, over 99% of its
revenue came from the domestic market --- a stark contrast to the
globalized distribution strategy of Hollywood films.

At the same time, **[[Chinese brands in]{.mark} [luxury]{.mark},
[tech]{.mark}nology, and [e-commerce]{.mark} continue to [make
international inroads]{.mark}.]{.underline}** BYD, now the
**[[world's]{.mark} [largest]{.mark} [e]{.mark}lectric [v]{.mark}ehicle
[manufacturer]{.mark}, recorded an [83 percent]{.mark}
[y]{.mark}ear-[o]{.mark}ver-[y]{.mark}ear [increase]{.mark} in overseas
sales last month]{.underline}**. Beauty brand Florasis has expanded into
European markets, while Pinduoduo's fusion of social networking and
e-commerce has been increasingly recognized as an innovative model for
online retail.

AI disruption: China\'s DeepSeek is reshaping the market #

China's soft power gains are also emerging in the technology sector,
where the launch of **[[DeepSeek]{.mark} AI has [shaken up U.S.
markets]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The debut of the cost-efficient AI model
triggered a \$969 billion selloff in semiconductor and AI infrastructure
stocks, signaling a major disruption in the global AI race.

The immediate reaction in financial markets was striking. More than 70%
of stocks in the Technology Select Sector ETF (XLK) declined, with
Nvidia losing nearly \$600 billion in value before rebounding as
investors bought the dip. **[DeepSeek's success suggests that
[China]{.mark} is no longer merely catching up in AI innovation --- it
is [actively reshaping]{.mark} the [industry's
trajectory]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

However, a key challenge is censorship. DeepSeek AI employs
multi-layered content moderation, filtering sensitive topics, erasing
responses mid-sentence, and retrospectively reviewing answers for
compliance. While this aligns with China's regulatory framework, it also
raises concerns about the AI model's international adoption.

China\'s soft power impact on global luxury, culture #

**[[Luxury brands]{.mark} must also [consider]{.mark} the broader
[implications]{.mark} of [China's s]{.mark}oft [p]{.mark}ower
[expansion]{.mark}.]{.underline}** With global influence increasingly
dictated by digital ecosystems, entertainment, and sustainability
narratives, Western luxury houses may need to rethink their approach.

For decades, Hollywood, French fashion, and European heritage brands
have maintained uncontested cultural dominance. Now, China is closing
the gap, driven by homegrown brands expanding overseas, the success of
domestic films, and advancements in AI-driven consumer engagement.

Yet, the question remains: can Chinese luxury and cultural brands
transcend their domestic success to achieve true global influence? The
record-breaking box office of Nezha 2 is a milestone, but the challenge
remains whether Chinese entertainment and fashion can scale globally in
the same way Hollywood and European maisons have.

Who's gaining and who's losing in soft power? #

Despite China's rise, the U.S. continues to lead the Global Soft Power
Index, ranking high in Familiarity, Influence, and Business & Trade. But
its governance rankings have slipped, reflecting growing political
instability and economic unpredictability.

Notably, the United Arab Emirates maintained its 10th position,
bolstered by business-friendly policies and diplomatic influence.

Israel and Ukraine saw sharp declines due to ongoing geopolitical
conflicts affecting their global reputation.

What's next? The future of China's soft power influence #

Whether in AI, luxury, or cultural exports, China is no longer simply
competing --- it is reshaping the global balance of influence. The
coming years will reveal whether this momentum translates into lasting
power, or if China remains an economic force without full cultural
integration.

For brands, investors, and global policymakers, **[[China's]{.mark}
[s]{.mark}oft [p]{.mark}ower [expansion]{.mark} is no longer a future
possibility --- it is a [present reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### China filled the soft power vacuum created by Trump.

The global landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, a
**[tectonic [shift in]{.mark} the balance of
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The sixth annual Global Soft Power
Index, released by Brand Finance, confirms what many have observed:
**[[China]{.mark} has [ascended]{.mark} to the world's [second
most]{.mark} influential [s]{.mark}oft [p]{.mark}ower]{.underline}**
nation, trailing only the United States.

This achievement, coinciding with **[[contrasting]{.mark} political
[pronouncements from Beijing and Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[underscores a [pivotal moment]{.mark} in [international]{.mark}
[relations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While China's Premier Li
Qiang outlines a vision of openness and engagement, U.S. president
Donald Trump champions a retreat into isolationism. This divergence
presents a fertile ground for China's soft power to flourish,
**[[filling]{.mark} the perceived [vacuum]{.mark} [left by]{.mark} a
[receding American presence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

China's ascent is not a sudden phenomenon; it is the
**[[culmination]{.mark} of a [deliberate, multi-faceted
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unlike the hard power dominance of
military might and economic coercion, soft power relies on attraction
and persuasion, on shaping perceptions and influencing preferences.
**[China has [meticulously]{.mark} [cultivated]{.mark} its [s]{.mark}oft
[p]{.mark}ower [through]{.mark} a diverse array of [cultural]{.mark},
[technological]{.mark}, and [diplomatic
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

At the heart of China's soft power strategy lies its burgeoning cultural
industry. Chinese films, once confined to domestic audiences, are
now garnering international acclaim. Blockbusters like *Ne Zha 2* and
the international buzz surrounding *Black Myth:
Wukong* demonstrate China's growing prowess in animation and gaming,
industries that resonate strongly with younger generations worldwide**[.
The [global success]{.mark} of [Chinese dramas]{.mark} and historical
series on streaming platforms underscores the universal appeal of
compelling storytelling.]{.underline}**

Beyond cinema and gaming, **[[China's]{.mark} digital [platforms]{.mark}
are [reshaping]{.mark} global [communication]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[TikTok]{.mark}, with its viral content and [trendsetting]{.mark}
[influence]{.mark}, has become a cultural phenomenon]{.underline}**,
particularly among young people. Xiaohongshu, a lifestyle and e-commerce
platform, is attracting a growing user base in the West, showcasing
Chinese trends and consumer culture. These platforms, while raising
concerns about data privacy and censorship**[, serve as powerful
[conduits]{.mark} [for]{.mark} cultural exchange and [s]{.mark}oft
[p]{.mark}ower [projection]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The promotion of the Chinese [language]{.mark} and culture is
[another cornerstone]{.mark} of China's [s]{.mark}oft [p]{.mark}ower
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Confucius Institutes, despite facing
scrutiny in some countries, have played a significant role in
**[disseminating Mandarin language education and cultural
awareness]{.underline}**. Online language learning platforms and
educational programs are further expanding access to Chinese language
and culture, fostering a deeper understanding of China among global
audiences.

**[China's [tech]{.mark}nological advancements are
[also]{.mark} [contributing]{.mark} to its [s]{.mark}oft
[p]{.mark}ower]{.underline}**. The country's rapid development in areas
like artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and telecommunications
has positioned it as a global leader in innovation. For instance**[,
companies like [DeepSeek]{.mark} are making significant strides in
developing advanced AI models]{.underline}**, showcasing China's growing
**[[capabilities]{.mark} in [cutting-edge
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**. DeepSeek's progress in areas like
large language models and AI-driven applications demonstrates China's
commitment to pushing the boundaries of technological innovation,
attracting international attention and respect. Huawei's 5G
infrastructure development and China's leadership in solar panel
production have resonated with nations seeking technological solutions.
China's investments in green technology and its commitment to addressing
climate change have also resonated with nations seeking sustainable
solutions.

Furthermore, **[[China's]{.mark} proactive diplomacy and its engagement
in [multilateral institutions]{.mark} have enhanced its international
standing. Its [B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad
[I]{.mark}nitiative,]{.underline}** while facing criticism for the
so-called debt traps, has provided infrastructure development and
economic opportunities to numerous countries, particularly in the
developing world. China's contributions to peacekeeping missions and
humanitarian aid efforts have further solidified its image as a
responsible global actor.

The timing of China's soft power ascent is particularly significant. As
the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates appears to be [retreating
from]{.mark} its traditional role of global [leadership]{.mark},
[China]{.mark} is [stepping]{.mark} forward to [fill]{.mark} the
perceived [vacuum]{.mark}. [Trump's]{.mark} "America First"
[rhetoric]{.mark}, his withdrawal from international
agreements,]{.underline}** and his imposition of trade tariffs have
alienated allies and **[[created uncertainty]{.mark} in the
international system.]{.underline}**

**[This perceived decline in U.S. soft power is creating
[opportunities]{.mark} for [China to expand its
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. U.S. cultural dominance, once
unquestioned, is facing increasing competition from Chinese cultural
products and digital platforms. The U.S. emphasis on unilateralism and
its skepticism towards multilateral institutions contrast sharply with
China's rhetoric of cooperation and shared prosperity.

Moreover, **[domestic [political]{.mark} [divisions]{.mark} and
[social]{.mark} [unrest]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, including events such as the January 6th Capitol riot
and [increasing]{.mark} political [polarization]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
have **[[tarnished]{.mark} its [image]{.mark} as a beacon of democracy
and stability]{.underline}**. **[[China]{.mark}, by
contrast, [presents]{.mark} itself [as]{.mark} a [stable]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [reliable]{.mark} partner, a nation [committed to
economic]{.mark} development [and international
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A key aspect of this decline is
highlighted by the **[[Trump]{.mark} administration's [cuts]{.mark} to
[USAID]{.mark}]{.underline}** and foreign aid programs, which have
historically been significant tools of U.S. soft power. This retreat
from international **[assistance [diminishes]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark}
[ability]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [project]{.mark} a [positive image]{.mark}
and build relationships through development and humanitarian
efforts.]{.underline}** This inconsistency between domestic policy and
international image erodes trust in the United States as a reliable
partner.

However, China's soft power ascent is not without its challenges.
Criticisms from certain Western political figures and media regarding
human rights, censorship, and intellectual property protection present a
persistent challenge to its global image. Furthermore, while China's
cultural exports and digital platforms have achieved considerable
traction among younger demographics, questions remain about their
ability to cultivate deeper, enduring influence across diverse
populations.

Despite these challenges, **[[China's]{.mark} [s]{.mark}oft
[p]{.mark}ower is undeniably [growing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Its
ability to leverage its cultural, technological, and diplomatic assets
has positioned it as a major player in the global arena. As the United
States appears to be withdrawing from its traditional role of global
leadership, **[[China]{.mark} is [poised]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[fill]{.mark} the perceived [vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}**, shaping the
international landscape in its own image.

### U---Arctic Expansion

#### Chinese Arctic [expansion]{.underline} now. 

**Respinti '24** \[Marco Respinti, 9-3-2024, \"China's "Polar Silk
Road." 1. How Beijing Expands in the Arctic\", Bitter Winter,
https://bitterwinter.org/chinas-polar-silk-road-1-how-beijing-expands-in-the-arctic/\]
yc

When the People's Republic of China's (PRC) is at issue, even **[the
[Arctic]{.mark} may become a subject for ideological
controversy.]{.underline}** In recent years, **[[Beijing's policies and
actions]{.mark} towards the North Pole have [grown
steadily]{.mark}]{.underline}**, culminating with the acceptance of the
PRC as an Observer to the Arctic Council in 2013. The first ever
**[Chinese Arctic [government policy paper]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
2018 **[[stressed the PRC's]{.mark} [commitment]{.mark}
to]{.underline}** upholding the institutional and legal framework for
**[Arctic governance]{.underline}** and to respecting the sovereign
rights of the Arctic states.

But this is only one side of that "white paper." The other side may be
glimpsed by reading thought its lines, as it is always needed when
confronted with the ambiguous language of the Chinese authorities. In
fact, by accepting the international legal state of the affairs on the
Arctic, **[Beijing also asserted its own right as a non-Arctic state to
participate in Arctic affairs ]{.underline}**under international law---a
highly significant development. It would mean a lot for any country, and
it does so especially for the PRC.

Beijing's Arctic policy suggests in fact **[a [strong desire to]{.mark}
push for the [internationaliz]{.mark}ation of the Arctic's [regional
governance system]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And while the "white paper" is
not a strategy document, it is even more interesting for what it omits
than for what it openly states. The national security concern, a major
driver of the PRC's ambitions in the glacial region, is a case in point.

Beijing's tryst with the Arctic

While the Chinese regime's acceleration in the participation in Arctic
international co-operation is fairly recent, all started when the
country became a party to the "Spitsbergen Treaty," later known as the
"Svalbard Treaty," in 1925, which recognized the sovereignty of Norway
over the archipelago of Svalbard, at the time called Spitsbergen.

Later on, in 1996, Beijing entered the International Arctic Science
Committee. However, it was only in 2007 that it did start sending
delegations to the meetings of the Arctic Council, the predominant
inter-governmental forum for the discussion on that extreme region's
issues. During the years immediately preceding the PRC's acceptance as a
formal observer in the Arctic Council, there was a noticeable uptick of
media reports and academic studies regarding the country's emerging
policies in the Arctic, including references to the PRC as both a
"near-Arctic State" (近北极国家) and an "Arctic stakeholder"
(北极利害关系国), despite the fact that the country does not have an
Arctic border. The nearest Chinese location to the Arctic Circle is in
fact in Mohe County (漠河县), Heilongjiang province, at 53°33' N, that
is to say, more than 1,400 kilometers from the Circle.

As mentioned earlier, Beijing recognizes the sovereignty of Arctic
states---or the states that "have territories within the Arctic and thus
carry the role as stewards of the region" as the Arctic Council
established---but simultaneously applies standard interpretations of
international law aimed at legalizing the presence of extra-regional
states there.

While the **[PRC consistently [frames its engagement]{.mark} in the
region [as a strategy of mutually beneficial
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, some Arctic countries have raised
**[[significant concerns about its growing economic
presence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, warning that Beijing may leverage its
geopolitical influence to change the existing norms and rules in the
polar region.

Meanwhile, the Arctic has also become an area of
growing cooperation between the PRC and the Russian Federation. The
Sino-Russian joint statement of February 2022 declares: "The sides
agreed to continue consistently intensifying practical cooperation for
the sustainable development of the Arctic." This mention of the Arctic
is the first of its kind in a Sino-Russian joint statement. It arguably
indicates how a weakened Russia increasingly dependent on China could be
willing to compromise on its resistance toward allowing non-Arctic
states to play a stronger role in the region.

Also, that very statement indicates that for the first time **[[Beijing
acknowledges]{.mark} that its [Arctic interests are no longer limited to
scientific research]{.mark} but [extend to a variety of commercial
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These are embedded in a new China-led
cooperation initiative which **[[aims to build a "Polar Silk
Road]{.mark}" that connects China with Europe via the
Arctic]{.underline}**. It corresponds to one of two new "blue ocean
passages," extending from the PRC's 21st Century Maritime Silk Road,
launched in 2013.

In a speech given by the then Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
PRC, Zhang Ming, at the Third Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik, in
October 2015, a brief, six-point plan for Beijing's emerging Arctic
policies was presented. It included the need for future exploration and
knowledge about the region, the protection and "rational use" of the
Arctic, respect for the inherent rights of Arctic states and indigenous
peoples, respect for the rights of non-Arctic states and the
international community, creation of a "multi-tiered co-operation
framework for win-win results" in the region, and the need for continued
observance of relevant international law and institutions, including the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the "Spitsbergen
Treaty." The first three points were hardly ground-breaking and were
assumed to be a normal stance by an Arctic Council observer state
seeking to build an Arctic identity. However, the fourth, fifth, and
sixth points were a tacit statement that the PRC wished and wishes to
play a more central role in future Arctic affairs. This is clear from
the Chinese commercial "salami-slicing" tactics in Norway and other
Nordic states in the Arctic. The case of Norway Recently, the Norwegian
government has called off a plan to sell the last privately owned piece
of land on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard in order to prevent its
acquisition by Beijing. The remote Sore Fagerfjord property consisting
of mountains, plains and a glacier in south-west Svalbard was in fact on
sale for euro 300 million. The archipelago, located halfway between
mainland Norway and the North Pole, has indeed become a geopolitical and
economic hotspot as while the ice melts relations grow ever frostier
between Russia and the West. Svalbard is governed under an unusual legal
framework that allows foreign entities to gain footholds in the region.
In fact, while the Treaty signed in 1920 recognizes Norwegian
sovereignty, it also gives citizens of the signatory powers---which
include the Russian Federation and the PRC---the same rights to exploit
its mineral resources.

Per Kyllingstad, a lawyer who represents the sellers, said to the
British daily "The Guardian" that he had received "**[[concrete signs of
interest" from Chinese potential buyers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who had
"**[been showing a real [interest in the Arctic and Svalbard]{.mark} for
a long time."]{.underline}** He added that the sale was a unique
occasion to **[[grab the "last private land in
Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and, to our knowledge, the last private
land in the world's high Arctic." In 2016, Oslo paid euro 33.5 million
to acquire the second-last piece of private land on Svalbard, near
Longyearbyen, which was also reportedly being eyed by Chinese investors.

#### China is investing in the arctic now.

Studies/Inter-regional Relations\], "China's Evolving Priorities and the
North Sea Route: The Long Game", 6-14-2025,
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-4868-9_11//phs-DZ)

Molloy, in a series of presentations to University of Akuryri in
Iceland; PRIO and UiT Alta, both in Norway, in November 2021 entitled
"Small states in the Presence of Power: Comparative perspectives of
China's engagement with Small States in the Nordic Arctic and Southeast
Asia," [emphasized that while [China]{.mark} has been [present
in]{.mark} the [Arctic for]{.mark} the past [twenty
years]{.mark}]{.underline} (Clingendael, 2020; Harper, 2022), it was
[concurrently **[developing]{.mark}** its [engagement in]{.mark} the
**[NSR]{.mark}**, its "Polar Silk Road", in collaboration [with
Russia]{.mark}. In mid-2022, [it]{.mark} had [invested]{.mark} more than
[\$90bn in **Arctic infrastructure**]{.mark}, including in financing
Russia's extractive infrastructure in the High North, taking LNG from
the Yamal peninsula both from depots on the NSR and through new
pipelines]{.underline} (Economist, 2022). Further it [has been investing
in [multi-use ports]{.mark} and [airfields]{.mark}, **[enhanced
collaboration]{.mark}** in scientific research [and]{.mark} has
[initiated the]{.mark} integration of [satellite]{.mark} navigation
[systems]{.mark} to monitor movements into the Barents Sea and sharing
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data. [China]{.mark}
clearly [wants a **seat** at]{.mark} the [Arctic
table]{.mark}]{.underline} (Grady, 2022; Harper, 2022) In a meeting
between Xi and Putin in early 2022, [Xi declared a "limitless
friendship" between China and Russia]{.underline}. The West was not
alarmed. This kind of rhetoric is expected. Despite China's expansionist
aggression in the South China Sea, insisting on implementing the
mythical Nine-dash Line; its failure to observe the ruling of the Court
of Arbitration in the Hague on this issue and its saber-rattling
regarding Taiwan, it was predicted that it would abide by the
rules-based order in the Arctic[. Currently [China seeks]{.mark} an
"[open]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}" [where it can do business beyond Russia
as]{.mark} an [aspect of]{.mark} its **[Polar Silk Road]{.mark}** and
has little interest in establishing military bases in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Grady, 2022) With this objective it sends
"emissaries, entrepreneurs and mediators, including Chinese nationals,
Norwegians, Icelanders, Swedes and Americans" (Harper, 2022). The seven
Western states, members of the Arctic Council, assumed that it would
continue to be in Russia's interests to operate the NSR within the
bounds of the agreed rules of the Council. In light of the cautious
"bromance" between Putin and Xi, both likely to rule for decades more,
and [the achievement of [Xi's]{.mark} Polar Silk Road ambitions, China
**[would play ball]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

### U---Arctic Minerals

#### China is shifting its focus to the Arctic for economic and resource potential

**Kochis '22** \[Daniel; July 28; Senior fellow for National Security
and Defense Foreign Policy in the Center on Europe and Eurasia at Hudson
Institute, former Research Fellow for European Affairs in the Margaret
Thatcher Center for Freedom; The Heritage Foundation; "U.S. Policymakers
Should Remain Wary of Chinese Ambitions in the Arctic";

// bryce

[**[China]{.mark}** is [motivated to become]{.mark} an [Arctic
actor]{.mark} for five primary reasons]{.underline}:

1\. [**[New Shipping Routes]{.mark}**. [China]{.mark} is unique in
modern times]{.underline} in that it is a continental power [almost
[entirely dependent on]{.mark} the [sea for]{.mark} its [food]{.mark}
and [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Sea lanes in the Arctic have the
potential to play an important role]{.underline} when it comes to
diversifying China's import dependencies. In December 2020, China
announced plans to launch a satellite in 2022 to monitor Arctic shipping
routes.

2[. Chinese **[Economic Influence]{.mark}**. [China sees itself
as]{.mark} a [global]{.mark} [power]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the
[[Arctic]{.mark} is just another [region]{.mark} in which [to
engage]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China [hopes to]{.mark}
[complement]{.mark} its **Belt and Road Initiative**
([BRI]{.mark})---]{.underline}a vast trading network being constructed
by China on the Eurasian landmass and beyond---[by investing in and
constructing major infrastructure projects along the emerging sea lanes
in the Arctic]{.underline}.

3\. **[Scientific Research]{.underline}**. Whether it is for China's
sea-based nuclear deterrent, natural resource extraction, or commercial
shipping, the research of polar high-altitude atmospheric physics,
glacial oceans, bioecology, and meteorological geology are important for
China's strategic interests. As a signatory of the Svalbard Treaty,
China is allowed to conduct scientific research on Svalbard, one of the
world's northernmost inhabited areas, with under 3,000 inhabitants, and
has done so since 2004 at its Arctic Yellow River Station located in Ny
Ålesund. In total, China has eight scientific research stations in the
Arctic. While the Arctic remains an important field of scientific study,
especially due to its unique attributes, some of the research China is
undertaking, including acoustic study and seabed mapping, could have
military applications. The U.S. and its allies have raised this
possibility.

4\. Laying the [Groundwork for [Future **Military** ]{.mark}**Activity**
[in the Region]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Currently, China's military
involvement in the Arctic is limited]{.underline}. [**The
[P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy** Navy has [never
sailed in]{.mark}to [Arctic waters]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the
director of the Norwegian Intelligence Service, Lieutenant General
Morten Haga Lunde, stated recently that "\[i\]n the long term, [we must
be prepared for a clearer Chinese presence also in our neighboring
areas]{.underline}." The Pentagon recently warned "that China could use
its civilian research presence in the Arctic to strengthen its military
presence, including by deploying submarines to the region as a deterrent
against nuclear attacks." Chinese journals have explored this
possibility, for example, publishing articles with titles such as
"Peridynamic Model for Submarine Surfacing through Ice."

5\. [[**Access to Minerals**, **Fishing**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[Other]{.mark} **[Natural Resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[China]{.mark} also [sees]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} region as a well
to be plumbed [for its resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[Arctic]{.mark} is [rich]{.mark} [in]{.mark} **[r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}inerals**,]{.underline} a key component of a
host of products from smartphones to electric batteries, to wind

[market dominance]{.mark} [in rare earth minerals]{.mark} and [wants
to]{.mark} keep it this way by [access]{.mark}ing those of [the

as]{.mark} a [solution]{.mark} [to]{.mark} its [food]{.mark} demands,
thinking the [dietary needs of]{.mark} its growing [population]{.mark}
could partially be [met by increased fish products from]{.mark} the
[Arctic region]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark} is heavily reliant
upon [energy imports]{.mark}, some of which [transit waterways]{.mark}
that [China deems vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia is an
energy-rich nation happy to sell to China; in 2021 alone, Russia
supplied China with 16.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions have
diminished Russian energy exports to the West, particularly oil exports.

### L---Arctic Governance

#### Increased [Arctic governance]{.underline} is used to [control]{.underline} China, stopping them from [economically]{.underline} engaging in the Arctic.

With temperatures increasing at twice the speed of the rest of the
planet, [[**Arctic** **land** and **sea**]{.mark} are constantly
**[shifting]{.mark}**]{.underline}, something which has
[[led]{.underline}]{.mark} Sanna Kopra [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} claim
that "[[Concerning]{.mark} **international** climate
**[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the fate of the Arctic is deeply
interconnected with China's climate change policies; while the Arctic is
the fastest warming region on the earth, China is the biggest greenhouse
gas emitter in the world" (Kopra, 2013: 2). In this way, Kopra argues
that Chinese policy -- like any other nation's policies on Arctic
affairs and climate change cannot be disconnected.

Utilising defensive-neorealism, Camilla Sørensen focuses on [[Chinese
engagement]{.mark} in order [to establish]{.mark} itself [as a
**necessary** **partner**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region --
[[focusing on]{.mark} **bilateral** [**ties** with **Nordic**
**countries**]{.mark}]{.underline} on, for example, the expansion of
Sweden's Lysekil port, the rollout of China's civil-military "BeiDou-2"
\[北斗-2\] [Arctic **satellite** **navigation** system]{.underline}, and
a [new **railroad** connecting Rovaniemi]{.underline}, Finland to
Kirkenes, Norway (Sørensen, 2019: 6). It is through these bilateral
investments, argues Sørensen, that [[China seeks to]{.mark}
**[counterbalance]{.mark}** other Arctic [actors]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the region and ensure its continued involvement.

Contrary to most Western analyses, [[Chinese scholar]{.mark} Chih Yuan
Woon [posits]{.mark}]{.underline} that China's engagement through the
Polar Silk Road paints [[a **positive** **picture** of]{.mark} Chinese
[involvement]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that viewing this as a
[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[subscribes to]{.mark} a "New
[**Cold** **War** **mentality**]{.mark}]{.underline}" \[新冷战褐制色彩
xīn lěngzhàn hè zhì sècǎi\] based on Western fears of a successful
non-Western power. To support this argument, Woon performs a discourse
analysis on Chinese government claims about "not overstepping" \[不越位
bù yuèwèi\] in the Arctic, ultimately citing the need for more
non-Western analyses of China's Polar Silk Road and Arctic strategy
(Woon, 2020: 5). While an insightful argument, [it remains difficult for
most scholars to maintain a **dovish** **perspective** towards China's
Arctic **strategy** in the face of]{.underline} events like the
[**Norway**--**China** dispute of 2006]{.underline}, in which China
imposed import controls on Norwegian Arctic salmon for six years
following the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Chinese dissident Liu
Xiaobo for his work on human rights (Pincus, 2020: 52).

[[Contested governance]{.mark} has [encouraged]{.mark}]{.underline} some
academics to [[analyse]{.mark} whether [**China's** actions]{.mark} in
the Arctic should be considered "**lawfare**]{.underline}", in the sense
of an attempt [[to "**rewrite**"]{.mark} current
**[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Arctic (Robinson, 2013).
Andrea Beck claims that China's actions are not lawfare, but comply with
UNCLOS, ultimately suggesting [[China has **commercial**]{.mark} rather
than **military** **[objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region
(Beck, 2014: 306). One issue with Beck's argument is that her [**three**
[**pillars** of]{.mark} Chinese [involvement]{.mark}]{.underline} --
scientific expeditions, participation in Arctic governance and Nordic
diplomacy -- [[fail to **incorporate**]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[increasing [**recognition** of **geo**-**economics** or]{.mark} the
[securitisation]{.mark}]{.underline} of traditionally non-securitised
sectors [[into]{.mark} **national**
[**decision**-**making**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While [[China may not be
blatantly **breaking** **laws**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic, this
[article does not accept this]{.underline} as a reason [to believe the
country does not have a wider strategy]{.underline} in the region.
Rather, the work of scholars Robinson and Lanteigne on Chinese defence
and military infrastructure in the Arctic show that Chinese interests
are no longer confined to scientific or commercial endeavours. That is
to say, the data shows China's increasing military and security interest
in Arctic affairs.

More [hawkish views [claim]{.mark} that a]{.underline} clear "**[[China
Threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in the Arctic [[suggests]{.mark} the need
for an [immediate **governing** **treaty**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Connolly, 2017: 8). Sørensen weighs the balance of power in Arctic
affairs, [[positing]{.mark} that [China seeks to
**counterbalance**]{.mark} the **Arctic** [**great**
**powers**]{.mark}]{.underline} by establishing relations with smaller
Arctic states like Iceland and Greenland (Sørensen, 2019). This lens,
while useful, does not consider the deeper question of why. Indeed,
focusing on China's narrative and discursive strategies may shed light
on the reasoning and strategy behind the country's actions in the
region.

Within this fast-changing system, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, although

**[commons]{.mark}** [to **shift**]{.mark} Arctic

Chinese government has advanced several arguments in favor of China as a
"near-Arctic" state. According to the Chinese People's Liberation Army
Navy rear admiral Yin Zhuo, "the Arctic belongs to all the people around
the world as no nation has sovereignty over it."9 [China is also
[challenging]{.mark} the legitimacy of "**every**

these established rules-based-order treaties and organizations, the
[Chinese [government employs **lawfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
Michael Dressler has called both an existential threat to the
international rule of law and an indispensable tool of American foreign

### L---BRI 

#### The success of the [BRI]{.underline} is key towards domestic [politcal]{.underline} legitimacy.

yc

These are not the only avenues by which **[[BRI might produce economic
benefits]{.mark} for China to help [retain political legitimacy for the
CPC]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Providing the impetus for modern economic
development in BRI partner states could create larger markets for
Chinese companies (Layne, 2018). China might be able to use the BRI to
set global standards that benefit its industries (de la Bruyère, 2021).
And it would stand to gain further if infrastructure improvements
attained through BRI projects made partner countries more viable as
investment destinations. African economies, for instance, could be of
significant interest to Chinese firms with business models requiring a
large supply of cheap labor that is no longer available in China (see
Ado and Su, 2016). Rather than winding these companies down

China might try to rebuild its factory of the world in Africa. The
Chinese economy could gain in several ways. Chinese firms might produce,
in China, higher value-added components that are then assembled in
Africa---in effect replicating the processing trade model that Western
firms implemented in China by offshoring assembly of imported inputs to
China (Dai, Maitra, and Yu, 2016). Assuming profitable operations,
factor income from these operations would also make a positive
contribution to the Chinese economy, not through GDP but through Gross
National Income. 3 Building up labor-intensive operations in Africa
could also have the geopolitically desirable (for the CPC) effect of
building up competitors to India's labor-intensive industries, thus
delaying Indian economic development. It could also tie African nations
more closely to China.

**[Even if all these expected economic benefits failed to materialize,
the [CPC]{.mark} might still be able to [leverage the BRI for domestic
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As we will discuss below,
**[[fo]{.mark}reign [pol]{.mark}icy [objectives loom large]{.mark} in
the BRI. The [BRI could therefore be sold to the Chinese people as a
large-scale patriotic project for the greater good of the
nation]{.mark}---specifically, [for China's status and security in the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If at least **[[part of the people could
be convinced that slower growth and continuing or rising inequality are
necessary sacrifices]{.mark} in this context, [the CPC may be able to
buy itself additional breathing room.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

GEOPOLITICAL OBJECTIVES

As this last point has illustrated, the BRI is also intricately linked
to China's geopolitical strategy. Table 1 provides an overview of key
strategic objectives served by the BRI, their underlying motivations,
and how the BRI helps address them. This list is illustrative rather
than exhaustive, and we take no position on the question whether these
objectives make sense; whether the CCP created the BRI specifically with
all these elements in mind; or whether it has already successfully
attained its objectives. But we do agree with prior analysis that it has
the potential to make meaningful strategic contributions. 4

**[A key objective of the BRI, as discussed in the preceding part, is to
shore up Chinese GDP]{.underline}** (Clarke, 2018; Mobley, 2019).
**[Beyond the domestic-level political objectives already noted, this
has [major implications for China's international political
position]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Viewed from a realist perspective, GDP
is a **[[key indicator of national power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Most
importantly, GDP correlates with the resources available to states for
conversion into military power by buying equipment and building up
standing armies. But GDP also indicates the potential for economic
coercion (see Gelb, 2009). For instance, a very large market, like
China, can leverage its size by cutting off imports from a much smaller
one, like Australia, in the knowledge that the resulting economic damage
weighs much more heavily on the latter. **[The significance of
maintaining GDP growth thus goes well beyond that of the [need of the
CPC to maintain legitimacy]{.mark} at home]{.underline}**; it is also
**[a key [ingredient in giving China as much
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and thus ability to attain its objectives
over the resistance of others, **[as possible in the international
arena.]{.underline}**

A second **[key objective is to [increase China's global presence and
prestige]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Clarke, 2018; Mobley, 2019) **[[and
attendant soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Nye, 1990). In contrast
with the West, China under the **[BRI provides support for economic
projects that have no strings attached to them]{.underline}** (or at
least appear to). In particular, **[China generally brackets the
political governance of the recipient country from the
discussion]{.underline}**. Unlike Western countries, **[China can also
[legitimately point to a wealth of recent experience with economic
development]{.mark} and claim that it is [sharing this experience with
partner countries through BRI projects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To the
extent both are seen as credible in partner countries, **[China's
[reputation abroad may benefit]{.mark}, which in turn [implies an
increase in soft power---the ability to coopt rather than
coerce]{.mark}]{.underline}**---that could be used to influence partner
and non-partner countries alike (Nye, 2020; Turcsanyi and Kachlikova,
2020).

### L---Climate Leadership

#### International [climate]{.underline} success is [key]{.underline} towards [domestic]{.underline} regime legitimacy

In recent years, **[[China]{.mark} has [taken a positive stance]{.mark}
and even assumed a [leading role in tackling climate]{.mark}
change]{.underline}**. Since the Paris Climate Conference, it has been
recognised more frequently as a more responsible actor in climate change
governance. Its commitment to combat global warming had remained
steadfast even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when China's economic
growth faced severe challenges. For instance, during the 2020 United
Nations (UN) General Assembly, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared
that China would strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. These
**[efforts have earned China recognition as a responsible global actor
in climate change governance.]{.underline}** For instance, the Climate
Change Performance Index (Climate Change Performance
Index Citation2020), a monitoring index jointly published by three
institutions, ranks China 11th in its annual report. However, China has
not always been proactive in tackling climate change and was once
considered an irresponsible actor in this regard (Hilton and
Kerr Citation2017, 49). This paper examines China's shift in attitude
towards climate change and seeks to investigate what drives China's
domestic and international commitments to combat climate change with a
firm determination. To do so, this study proposes a
conceptual-analytical framework of legitimacy-seeking and investigates
the circumstances under which China will actively participate in global
governance.

The existing literature on China and global climate change has
extensively discussed China's role in mitigating climate change
(Garnaut Citation2014; Cai and Li Citation2018; Hilton and
Kerr Citation2017). While there have been descriptive perspectives,
there have also been debates about China's motivations for tackling the
climate crisis. The scholarship on this critical issue has yielded
inconsistent and sometimes conflicting analyses. Scholars who approach
this question from an international perspective believe China's policy
shift is a response to external pressure to fulfil great powers'
responsibilities (Kopra Citation2018; Qi et al. Citation2008).
Conversely, other studies identify domestic concerns such as the demand
for renewable energy, the smog problem, and economic restructuring as
the primary drivers for China's climate policy (Economy Citation2019,
153--160; Hilton and Kerr Citation2017, 51; Ploberger Citation2013,
1029). While the existing literature offers valuable insights into the
factors that drive shifts in China's climate change policies, a clear
analytical framework is needed to sufficiently explain China's domestic
and international policymaking considerations. Therefore, they cannot
address some of the significant puzzles surrounding this paper's
research question. For instance, it remains to be seen under what
conditions China is willing to sacrifice its economic growth to appease
external pressure and take on more international responsibilities.
Additionally, the Chinese government must balance significant policy
issues such as air quality and economic development, which sometimes
conflict. Researchers expect a systematic framework to examine the
Chinese government's behaviour patterns regarding these issues. Last,
how does the Chinese public perceive climate change, and how are the two
issues of climate change and air pollution interconnected? These are
critical questions that require comprehensive and nuanced analyses.

Since 2013, Chinese President **[[Xi]{.mark} Jinping has been [educating
his comrades]{.mark} that '[there is a lot of
politics]{.mark}']{.underline}** (这里面有很大的政治) **[[in protecting
the environment]{.mark} and advocating a low-carbon
lifestyle]{.underline}** (Study Times Citation2016). Following this
clue, this paper proposes a conceptual-analytical **[framework of
states' legitimacy-seeking to fill the gap]{.underline}** in the
existing research on China and climate change. This study argues that
**[China's engagement in climate change mitigation is driven by the
government's efforts to [enhance its legitimacy]{.mark} both
[domestically]{.mark} and internationally]{.underline}**. Furthermore,
by conducting a two-level analysis of how China seeks to increase its
legitimacy through prioritising environmental protection and combating
climate change, this paper posits that **[legitimacy-seeking is the
crucial factor motivating China's policymaking decisions]{.underline}**.
Moreover, this framework sheds light on the broader debate on when China
will integrate into or challenge the West-dominated international order.
Legitimacy-seeking is a critical factor behind climate policies and
offers insights into China's behaviours regarding territorial disputes,
international trade, financing and its response to the COVID pandemic.

The article proceeds as follows. In the first section, we explore the
necessity for states, particularly authoritarian ones, to seek domestic
and international legitimacy. We also examine the complex relationship
between the two types of legitimacy and the state's priorities, which is
crucial for understanding China's international behaviours. Next, we
provide detailed analyses of China's shift to positive attitudes and
policies in responding to climate change in the past ten years. We
investigate how the need to enhance domestic and international
legitimacy has played a critical role in these policy changes. In the
last section, we focus on the Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping,
analysing how his perception of legitimacy has been influencing China's
climate policies. Finally, we conclude by re-evaluating the
legitimacy-seeking framework and discussing recent developments in
China's domestic and international climate policies.

Domestic and international legitimacy-seeking of states

**[[Having domestic legitimacy]{.mark} means that the [subjects have a
belief in the rightness of a state]{.mark} and the oughtness of their
obedience to the commands]{.underline}** (Barker Citation1990, 11).
'Rightness' includes both factual correctness and moral justice. It is
critical for legitimacy, as Dahl and Lindblom (Citation1953, 114) have
claimed, **['Control is legitimate to the extent that it is approved or
regarded as "right".']{.underline}** Meanwhile, a belief in rightness
alone is not enough to establish legitimacy because even if some people
recognise the state's rightness, they may not obey it. Therefore, belief
in rightness is only necessary for domestic legitimacy. **[A belief in
the oughtness of obedience means subjects' recognition of their moral or
ethical obligation to obey the rules and policies of a
state]{.underline}**. The belief in oughtness usually builds based on a
belief in rightness, and these two dimensions of belief constitute
domestic legitimacy. People's support for ruling the country grants
domestic legitimacy to the political party and government. Although the
domestic legitimacy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has received
significant academic attention, there has been a lack of focus on the
second dimension: international legitimacy. To fill this gap, this
article presents a two-level (domestic-international) analytical
framework to examine policymaking logic in China.

For established democracies, domestic legitimacy largely derives from
elections. In comparison, authoritarian governments rely on complex
sources to legitimise their rule and maintain public obedience. While
state power like police forces can enforce compliance, relying solely on
them is not sufficient to guarantee continued governance and can leave
the regime vulnerable to challenges from within or mass public unrest
(Weatherley Citation2007, 1). State power cannot be persistently
established based on power rule but needs to be recognised and obeyed by
the people (Zhou Citation2017, 15). Therefore, if a regime seeks to
secure long-term stability, it must have the support and perceived
legitimacy of the population it governs (Weatherley Citation2007, 1).
This was reflected in China's relaxation of the strict 'Zero-COVID'
policy in late 2022. The Chinese government needed to change its
stringent epidemic prevention measures that could no longer contain the
spread of the virus, when some prevention measures faced widespread
public discontent and protests.

**[The prevailing discussion of [authoritarian regime legitimacy centres
around performance legitimacy]{.mark}, which assumes that the ruling
party or leader can improve public living standards]{.underline}** by
offering domestic public goods through effective policies.
**[[Environmental sustainability is considered a critical
component]{.mark} of providing public goods. The Chinese government also
seeks legitimacy through charismatic and legal-rational
authorities]{.underline}**. Still, performance legitimacy is paramount
for younger generations of leaders without experiences in revolutionary
movements during China's Anti-Japanese War and Civil War. In addition to
performance legitimacy, **[nationalist legitimacy is the other crucial
element of the Chinese government's overall legitimacy]{.underline}**.
With China's economic growth slowing and international tensions
heightening, nationalism increasingly shapes the government's foreign
policy decisions. The government's assertive actions in foreign-related
disputes have garnered popular support. However, when faced with
tensions between performance and nationalist legitimacy, the Chinese
government must weigh the significance of both and carefully craft its
policies.

In addition to domestic legitimacy, scholars in international studies
have introduced the concept of international legitimacy. Martin Wight
(Citation1977, 153) defines international legitimacy as 'the collective
judgement of international society about rightful membership of the
family of nations', and to some extent, it refers to 'moral
acceptability to the remainder of international society' (Citation1972,
1). While there has yet to be a consensus on the role of morality, norms
and rules in international relations, their binding force has grown
since the end of World War II. The international level of the
legitimacy-seeking framework focuses on the international legitimacy of
states to explain their external behaviours, rather than emphasising the
legitimacy and authority of international institutions (Hurd
Citation1999). States and other actors in international society engage
in comprehensive legitimisation strategies to demonstrate the legitimacy
of their activities or actions (Clark Citation2005, 2). International
legitimacy is important for the international reputation and status of
global powers. Even great powers require international legitimacy for
their foreign policies and international behaviours to be accepted by
other states. As Hedley Bull (Citation1980, 437) explains, 'To say that
a state is a great power is to say not merely that it is a member of the
club of powers that are in the front rank in terms of military strength,
but also that it regards itself, and is regarded by other members of the
society of states, as having special rights and duties'. To achieve
international legitimacy, a state must, at a minimum, comply with
universally recognised international rules, such as the UN Charter. If a
state can also provide public goods or solve global challenges, this can
increase its international legitimacy. This research defines
legitimacy-seeking as the efforts of a government or dominant party to
enhance the legitimacy of its domestic rule and rightful international
membership and leadership. States are motivated to secure domestic and
international legitimacy to ensure internal social and political
stability as well as external recognition and respect. The two types of
legitimacy are closely intertwined. Domestic legitimacy possesses an
essential international aspect because a government and its people
require international recognition that can boost the domestic legitimacy
of authoritarian regimes (Clark Citation2005, 5). However, domestic
legitimacy and international legitimacy are only sometimes aligned
because a country's national interests may conflict with external
expectations. An instance is territorial and maritime disputes. One
government's actions to defend its national interests increase domestic
legitimacy but may bring criticism from its neighbours. When domestic
legitimacy and international legitimacy converge, China has a stronger
incentive to integrate its domestic and international policies and to
participate in global governance. Weiss and Wallace (Citation2021,
644--646) highlight that authoritarian regimes are highly motivated to
address international issues that align with their domestic priorities.
In cases where there is a conflict between domestic and international
legitimacy, the state tends to prioritise maintaining its domestic
legitimacy, particularly when an issue may threaten the stability of the
country and the regime. However, if a policy can significantly increase
international legitimacy with minimal negative domestic impact, the
government is more likely to adopt it. The following sections of this
paper will discuss how China's need to improve domestic and
international legitimacy has influenced its efforts to address climate
change constructively. From resistance to aspiration: seeking
international legitimacy for China's leadership China accounts for 29%
of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, more than double the amount
produced by the United States, the world's second-biggest emitter (Union
of Concerned Scientists Citation2022). Despite this, China's integration
into the West-dominated climate governance system had been slow and
arduous. China's 2011 White Paper on climate change stated its
contribution during the 2009 Copenhagen Conference and emphasised the
principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities',Footnote1
insisting on the historical responsibilities of developed countries in
reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and offering financial and
technological assistance to developing countries (Information Office
Citation2011). However, Western academics and media outlets heavily
criticised China's stance during the Copenhagen Conference. China's
policies were even interpreted as resistant to fulfilling its
responsibilities in addressing climate change (Hilton and Kerr
Citation2017, 49; Gong Citation2011, 159--162). Such suspicion was
further reinforced when China claimed that imposing additional GHG
reduction obligations on developing countries was unreasonable. From the
late 2000s onwards, China has sought to assuage the concerns of
neighbouring countries by suggesting that its rise will be peaceful and
non-hostile (Glaser and Medeiros Citation2007, 293--298). Despite this,
China's refusal to commit to a greenhouse gas reduction timetable and
rejection of national performance monitoring during the Copenhagen
Conference was perceived as evidence of its increasingly assertive
diplomacy (Johnston Citation2013, 14). This stance was seen by some as a
threat to international cooperation on climate change, contributing to
the negative portrayal of China's rise and its global image (Swaine
Citation2010; Christensen Citation2011). Against this backdrop, China's
long-term interests were not well-served by this perception of
assertiveness, which has made China's rise be viewed and presented
negatively. China's stance on climate change also conflicted with the
interests of those developing countries most affected by rising
temperatures and sea levels. This international image undermined China's
reputation and relationships with other countries, particularly Western
countries and some island nations, calling into question China's
narrative of being a 'responsible power' and 'representing the interests
of the third world and developing countries'. Additionally, China faced
pressure from the West, with the European Union in 2009 urging China to
be part of the solution rather than being a part of the problem during
the Copenhagen Conference (France 24 Citation2009). Sino-EU relations
remain an influential factor in China's climate policy, with French
diplomatic efforts credited as one reason for China's cooperation in the
Paris Agreement (Hilton and Kerr Citation2017, 54). Furthermore,
pressure from the US during the Obama administration prompted China's
engagement in addressing the climate crisis. In November 2014, China and
the US jointly announced their intention to combat climate change, with
China acknowledging its critical role in addressing the issue and
committing to achieving a peak in CO2 emissions around 2030. This set
the stage for China to play a more positive role in the 2015 Paris
Climate Conference, where it celebrated the resulting agreement as a
milestone in global climate governance with greater legal force.
Following the Paris Conference, China's central authorities moved
quickly to issue and implement nationwide emissions peak commitments.
The 13th five-year plan for the country introduced a suite of domestic
environmental policies to fulfil its promise (National Development and
Reform Commission Citation2016). While international pressure played a
crucial role in pushing China to address climate change and improve its
global image, it is simplistic to view China's policies as solely
reactive. Ultimately, it was China's choice to act on global warming. As
early as 2014, Xi Jinping emphasised that China's policies towards
climate change were 'not because the others asked us to do so, but we
choose to do so' (Ren Citation2014). It has become increasingly apparent
that China seeks to portray itself as a leading power in global
governance and to have a positive global image. An example is China's
unwavering support for the Paris Agreement despite the Trump
administration's decision to withdraw the US from the accord. China
remained committed to the multilateral agreement in narrative and
practice, even though it had an opportunity to back out of the
agreement. In a historic declaration made in September 2020, Xi Jinping
announced China's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060,
which is a significant milestone considering that the European Union and
Japan aim to achieve the same goal by 2050, only ten years ahead of
China. Therefore, the 2060 goal presents a considerably challenging task
for the country, given its current reliance on coal-dominated energy and
rising carbon emissions. The goal is widely considered ambitious,
particularly given the United States' withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement and the European Union's decreased climate ambition. China's
commitment to this goal is seen as a significant step and adds to its
international legitimacy. This surprising declaration to the
international community is clearly not explained by 'responding to
international pressure'. China's commitment to addressing climate
change, as shown through actions and statements following Xi Jinping's
announcement, reflects its ambition to enhance international legitimacy
and play a larger role in global climate governance. For instance, in
September 2021, Xi Jinping announced that China would support green and
low-carbon energy development in developing countries and cease
financing coal power plants outside China. This move has created
opportunities for greater cooperation between China and countries
affected by the climate crisis, including island states like Fiji and
Maldives. Collaborations on new energy and climate governance
initiatives with these countries were launched. Furthermore, the
establishment of the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action
Cooperation Centre has been praised by the Secretary-General of the
Pacific Islands Forum, Henry Puna, during then-Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang Yi's visit to the South Pacific in 2022 (China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MFA) Citation2022a), showing that China's high-profile actions
in climate change have been recognised by the global south. Against this
backdrop, it is evident why China has actively promoted various slogans
and initiatives since Xi Jinping ascended to power in 2012. Such slogans
can potentially enhance China's discourse power in global governance.
The most prominent among these slogans is 'A Community of Shared Future
for Mankind' (人类命运共同体), which was introduced in 2012 when Xi took
office and incorporated into the CPC's party constitution in 2017. This
strategic narrative serves as the guiding principle for China to tackle
global challenges and gain global leadership (Yang Citation2021,
299--313). Among the most pressing challenges facing humankind today,
climate change must take precedence as a priority for constructing a
community of shared future. Failing to actively participate in efforts
to address this problem, or prioritising short-term economic gains over
environmental policies, would severely undermine the credibility and
appeal of this slogan. Such actions could even undermine China's
extensive efforts to build trust in the international community.
Additionally, Western countries and scholars have levied criticisms
against China regarding maritime security, human rights, international
trade and intellectual property. As Xiaoyu Pu (Citation2016, 120--121)
points out, many Chinese actions do not conform to the norms of the
liberal international order. China is unwilling to compromise on issues
that are essential to its core interests, and it therefore prefers to be
seen as an important power that is 'different but legitimate'. In this
context, climate change is a convergence point for China's national
interests and those of other powers. China can enhance its normative
legitimacy in the international community by engaging in climate change
governance. This will improve its credibility and reputation, especially
in light of controversies surrounding its controversial actions in other
areas. In April 2021, China and the US announced a joint pledge to
collaborate urgently to address the climate crisis (US Department of
States Citation2021a). During COP 26 in Glasgow, the two countries
released a comprehensive joint declaration that detailed precise
cooperative measures to address the climate crisis over the next decade
(US Department of States Citation2021b). Climate change later remains
one of the few areas where China and the US have achieved positive
outcomes in negotiations since President Biden took office.
Additionally, since climate change avoids significant ideological
conflicts, it has become a prominent issue for China to lead. Therefore,
China's commitment to addressing climate change is not just a response
to international pressure, but it also serves as a crucial component of
China's efforts to enhance its international legitimacy. It helps build
an image of China as a responsible power of the international community
and a supporter of multilateralism. Not merely an economic issue:
seeking domestic legitimacy by protecting the environment Despite
concerns over international obligations and recognition, addressing
climate change is primarily based on domestic considerations. The
Chinese government faces the tasks of economic growth, environmental
preservation and climate change mitigation. Put differently, China's
performance legitimacy is derived from both its economic growth and its
ability to offer public goods, such as a healthy environment. Rapid
economic development since Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening up has
resulted in China's heavy reliance on energy imports, the primary reason
for its energy security concerns. According to Zou (Citation2021), a
prominent expert in China's climate policymaking circles, China's goals
of reducing GHG emissions and achieving carbon neutrality are essential
for promoting sustainable economic growth and improving environmental
quality. Promoting renewable and low-carbon energy is a strategic
approach to achieving the government's GHG emission reduction targets.
Despite China's move towards clean energy, coal and petroleum still
account for 57.7% and 18.9%, respectively, of the country's total energy
consumption in 2019 (Information Office Citation2020). China has
invested heavily in renewable energy to address this issue, achieving
manufacturing advantages in this field. For instance, China is the
world's leading supplier of solar panels, accounting for 80% of global
production (Rapoza Citation2021). China also prioritises research,
development, production and use of solar power and electric vehicles.
Considering the large number of cars already on the roads and the high
demand for automobiles among the Chinese population, promoting new
energy vehicles and replacing older automobiles will help reduce China's
dependence on oil imports and facilitate the growth of its electric
vehicle industry. One example is that the Chinese government's
attractive investment policy and substantial domestic market have
continually attracted Tesla to invest heavily in Shanghai. In addition
to economic calculations, societal and bottom-up pressures drive China's
green transformation. Evidence suggests that the Chinese public is
increasingly conscious of and supportive of global efforts to tackle the
climate crisis. Academic research has investigated the level of concern
that the Chinese public has about climate change. According to Liu et
al. (Citation2020, 16--18), while the general population in China may
express relatively lower levels of concern about climate change compared
to Western countries, specific demographic groups, such as the younger
generation, women and residents of more developed regions, exhibit
higher levels of concern. This growing interest and engagement among
these groups, particularly the younger generation, indicate the
potential for increased Chinese public involvement in addressing the
climate crisis. Undoubtedly, the bottom-up social pressure and awareness
primarily stem from China's severe air pollution problem, leading to the
nationwide 'war on pollution'. This effort significantly contributes to
China's climate policies, due to the environmental and public health
challenges by burning coal and petroleum, including vast amounts of CO2,
the primary GHG, SO2 and other particulate matter. A survey conducted by
the China Centre for Climate Change Communication in 2017 revealed that
most ordinary Chinese citizens were aware of the connection between
China's air pollution and climate change. Concerns about climate change
were closely intertwined with air pollution, with 94.4% of respondents
believing climate change exists, 79.8% expressing concerns and over 90%
supporting current policies to address it. As per the survey, 72.6% of
the respondents thought climate change and air pollution were
interrelated, and another 14.3% believed climate change would result in
air pollution. Air pollution was the most worrying consequence of
climate change for Chinese people compared to natural disasters such as
droughts and flooding. About 95.1% of the survey respondents claimed
that climate change would lead to an increased occurrence of air
pollution in the absence of countermeasures over the next two decades
(China Center for Climate Change Communication Citation2017). Initially,
ordinary Chinese people were unaware of the risks posed by air
pollutants. Prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, four American
cyclists wearing masks due to air quality concerns caused outrage among
the Chinese public, who saw it as a political insult, leading to the
four cyclists apologising. As one cyclist remarked to the media, 'Had I
known it was going to be perceived as an insult, I wouldn't have done
it' (Charles Citation2008). However, just two years later, PM2.5
(particles with a diameter below 2.5 micrometres) and air pollution
gradually became hot topics of discussion in China, catalysed by public
concern. The sale of pollution masks surged, with people realising their
effectiveness in mitigating the effects of smog inhalation (Li
Citation2014). In Beijing, wearing masks became commonplace during
severe air pollution. In 2017, one Chinese netizen reflected on the 2008
'mask incident', 'I also used to think that these athletes were
hypocritical. I feel ashamed of myself now, and it was my ignorance that
made me indignant for no reason'.Footnote2 Following the public's
increased awareness of the severe consequences of air pollution,
dissatisfaction escalated and garnered the attention of state-controlled
media and environmental agencies. However, it took several years before
the government took concrete actions to integrate PM2.5 data into
China's air quality index. A professor from the Party School of the CPC
Central Committee stated that publishing PM2.5 data is not a
technological or financial issue. The real problem is that 'once the
particulate index is revised, the official data may make the government
look bad...it requires courage to do so' (Guo Citation2013). The
reluctance to publish air pollution data at the time indicated that the
Chinese government was concerned that it might damage its image as a
competent authority and harm its domestic legitimacy. China's sources of
domestic legitimacy differ from its Western counterpart, raising the
question of how much public opinion affects policymaking. Before 2008,
environmental protests in China had limited influence, as they were
primarily driven by local concerns (Sun and Zhao Citation2008; Hess
Citation2013). The authorities could quell the unrest by cancelling
proposed chemical industry projects, closing heavily polluting
factories, or punishing local officials to maintain the Chinese
government's domestic legitimacy. However, public outcry about air
quality gradually intensified across the country after 2008. Qingzhi
Xun, a Peking University expert studying Xi Jinping's thoughts, warned
that environmental protection has become a significant political issue,
which could affect people's faith in socialism and the nation's vision
for the future. Consequently, the CPC must take a high-profile political
stance to accomplish its political mission from the political height of
its ruling goals and power consolidation (Xun Citation2018). In
authoritarian states, the top leadership must give enough weight to
large-scale public opinion because it directly affects their legitimacy,
regime security and personal safety (Weiss Citation2013, 5). After the
18th Party Congress in 2012, the new Chinese leadership and the
Communist Party could no longer ignore the mounting social pressure and
worries about air pollution. Both the elites and the general public
expressed widespread dissatisfaction. Recognising this, then-Premier Li
Keqiang, who also headed the Leading Small Group on Climate Change,
Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction, publicly acknowledged the
government's shortcomings in this area. He pledged to tackle the issue
with 'iron fist enforcement and iron face accountability' in the future
(Zhu Citation2013). The significant bottom-up social pressure and the
growing attention of leaders to the issue of air pollution prompted the
environmental agencies to finally include PM2.5 data in China's air
quality index. Starting in 2013, Chinese citizens could access the PM2.5
data for 74 major cities, and over time, the data became available for
most miniature cities and counties as well. Apart from data
accessibility, the Chinese government has invested substantial amounts
in promoting sustainable energy sources such as solar power and
hydropower, and new environmental policies and laws have been
implemented more effectively. Furthermore, specific and effective
measures have been taken in major cities and economic centres, such as
shutting down small industrial enterprises with low-energy efficiency
and banning straw burning in rural areas. It is doubtful that China's
environmental policies, especially those related to air pollution, would
have been such a priority without public pressure. As China introduced
positive measures to tackle environmental issues, it became increasingly
concerned about controlling public mobilisation due to fears that
environmental protests might dampen their domestic legitimacy and
threaten political stability. The documentary 'Under the Dome', which
focussed on China's smog problem, triggered a widespread discussion
about air pollution in China in early 2015, contributing to heightened
dissatisfaction among the Chinese population (Steinhardt and Wu
Citation2016, 77). Not surprisingly, it was later censored, and the
producer was subjected to criticism by the media and climate change
sceptics. When faced with questions from society, China's
state-controlled press pointed to the 'Great Smog of London' as a
historical example to present smog as a natural side-effect of
industrialisation and economic development (Li and Svarverud
Citation2018, 357--358). Such narratives and practices reflect the
Chinese government's anxiety regarding the growing influence of liberal
'opinion leaders' and the risks of social control. The government is
concerned that expressions of indignation may undermine people's support
for the Communist Party and erode its legitimacy. Consequently, it seeks
to control any event that might significantly influence large-scale
public discourse. Additionally, there is direct evidence that the CPC
considers climate change to be vital to its ability to govern. On March
15, 2021, Xi Jinping held a high-level meeting where he declared the
integration of global warming objectives into the overall layout of
building an ecological civilisation. Thus, combating climate change is
now formally included in the broader task of protecting the environment
and ecology. The meeting acknowledged that 'Peaking carbon emissions and
achieving carbon neutrality is a tough battle, and it is also a major
test of the party's capabilities in governing the country' (Xinhua
Citation2021). By making this statement, tackling climate change has
been listed as an indicator to assess the CPC's ruling capability,
confirming that the Chinese government's principal reason for pursuing
climate change is to maintain its domestic legitimacy and power. 'There
is a lot of politics': Xi Jinping's concerns over the legitimacy Policy
preferences of leaders are a crucial variable in foreign policy analysis
as every individual has personalised values and images that influence
policy outcomes. These beliefs and images act as 'cognitive filters',
which affect the perception of international and domestic affairs
(Ripsman, Taliaferro, and Lobell Citation2016, 61--66). Compared to
Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping is considered more dominant in
China's decision-making process. Therefore, assessing China's evolving
policies necessitates an examination of Xi's personal attributes.
Therefore, it is essential to investigate Xi Jinping's role when
examining China's legitimacy-seeking efforts behind climate policy
decisions. China's climate change policy has generally demonstrated
consistency, but the period after 2012 saw a significant shift. The
Hu-Wen administration had already begun paying close attention to
environmental and climate problems. In 2007, China established the
Leading Small Group on Climate Change, Energy Conservation and Emission
Reduction, a group of high-level officials responsible for shaping the
country's climate and environmental policies. However, economic
development was a higher priority. Chinese leaders are faced with a
paradox in addressing climate change: on the one hand, mitigating
climate change requires sacrificing short-term economic growth with
potential negative impacts on state legitimacy; on the other hand,
business-as-usual can also undermine its legitimacy as a nation
committed to environmental protection (Marks Citation2010, 985). China's
effective plans, measures and policies to combat climate change and air
pollution were not introduced until 2012, when Xi Jinping was elected
General Secretary of the CPC. The concept of 'Beautiful China' was
introduced at the Eighteenth National Congress of the CPC, guiding
China's climate change policy (Hu Citation2012). The idea of ecological
civilisation was presented and added as one of the guiding principles
for China's development in the Chinese constitution (Xi Citation2020,
359). Since then, the Chinese government has implemented measures to
increase energy efficiency and reduce reliance on coal, while adopting a
more responsible approach to global warming. While discussing China's
economic situation in April 2013, Xi Jinping emphasised the necessity of
protecting the environment, 'If we continued this mode of backward
development, what would happen even if our GDP were doubled? I am afraid
the resources and environment will not be able to bear it at all...
People's happiness has been greatly reduced, and even strong
dissatisfaction will come up. What kind of situation will that be?
Therefore, in terms of constructing ecological civilisation, protecting
of ecological environment, and advocating green and low-carbon
lifestyles, we cannot merely regard them as an economic issue. There is
a lot of politics' (Study Times Citation2016). China's increased
emphasis on environmental protection is closely linked to Xi Jinping's
long-term commitment and policy preferences on this issue. According to
Xi himself, the youthful experiences of witnessing ecological damage in
the Loess Plateau have deeply influenced him, leading him to focus on
environmental protection (Xi Citation2019). These words are not empty
rhetoric, and policies in his career record support his claim. For
instance, 'Green Hills and Clear Waters are Gold and Silver
Mountains',Footnote3 commonly known as the 'two mountains theory', is
one of China's most widely disseminated street slogans today. As early
as 2005, when China lacked the adequate environmental governance, Xi
Jinping, then the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Secretary, put
forward this slogan. During his tenure in Zhejiang Province from 2002 to
2007, Xi published 14 articles dealing specifically with environmental
governance issues, such as the 'two mountains theory' in Zhejiang Daily
(Xi Citation2007, 1--8). His articles comprehensively outlined his ideas
on transforming economic development models and the relationship between
economic growth and environmental governance (Xi Citation2007, 1--8,
153, 186--187, 223--224). As the most well-known book series published
under Xi's name, the collection of his speeches, Xi Jinping: The
Governance of China, includes a dedicated chapter on climate change and
environmental issues. Furthermore, he has convened numerous high-level
meetings to convey his thoughts and build consensus among governmental
agencies. During a Politburo joint study session on May 24, 2013, Xi
urged his colleagues, 'We must fully understand the importance of
enforcing ecological red lines. Any violations regarding environmental
protection will be punished...We will establish an accountability system
and call to account officials whose ill-judged decisions have caused
serious ecological damage' (Xi Citation2014, 207--212). The background
of Xi's words was that in the past, local officials prioritised economic
development above all else, often neglecting the environmental cost of
obsolete industries. Following his instructions, a lifelong liability
accounting mechanism was established, obligating local officials to
consider the long-term environmental costs of developing high-polluting
and greenhouse gas-emitting industries. Xi Jinping has also emphasised
the importance of environmental protection by releasing the economic
growth requirement for local officials in provinces with high pollution
or fragile ecology, at least rhetorically. For instance, Hebei Province
is well-known for its steel industry and severe air pollution. During a
discussion with Hebei's leaders in September 2013 regarding the air
quality issue, Xi Jinping acknowledged that the situation had severely
impacted people's health and the party and government's image. Xi
pointed out that if they did not resolve the problem, 'we will not be
able to account for history and the people'. He pledged to reward the
local officials if Hebei could resolve the air pollution problem, even
if it harmed their GDP ranking (Jia Citation2017). Xi has also
instructed the leaders of Qinghai Province and Tibet Autonomous Region
to prioritise ecological and environmental protection, despite
relatively low economic development compared to other Eastern provinces.

Many of **[China's]{.underline}** domestic and **[[international
commitments to addressing environmental issues and climate change are
closely linked to Xi Jinping's]{.mark} evaluation of the [CPC's domestic
legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When he took office in 2012, the
Chinese regime faced numerous challenges and a crisis of legitimacy
(Baranovitch Citation2021, 249--265). Xi Jinping recognised that China's
development stage differed significantly from previous years. He
believed that China had already resolved the food and clothing problem
in a previous stage of development, and the new situation required him
to address environmental issues (Xi Citation2017, 392). In other words,
while **[the [CPC's previous]{.mark} performance [legitimacy came
primarily from economic growth, Xi]{.mark} Jinping [believes that
improving environmental quality is]{.mark} also [necessary]{.mark} for
domestic legitimacy]{.underline}**. Xi proposes that the strategy of
building a Beautiful China could be combined with 'supply-side
structural reforms'(供给侧改革), and this would in turn help to develop
China's green and low-carbon economy (Xi Citation2020, 367--368). He has
also repeatedly emphasised that building an ecological civilisation
would greatly benefit future generations, and governments at all levels
and society should take this principle seriously.

Xi Jinping has stressed the significance of protecting the ecology and
environment, recognising that enhancing the environment will mitigate
potential risks for the CPC. At the same time, continuing contamination
could threaten the Communist Party's rule of China. The book Xi
Jinping's China Renaissance, published in 2016 with the support and
promotion from the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee,
contends that from the perspective of a ruling party's leader, Xi's
aspiration to achieve ecological civilisation is not simply an expedient
gesture of compromise to international pressure or domestic economic
transformation. Instead, such efforts aim to 'win people's hearts',
which is critical for the party's ruling position and survival (Study
Times Citation2016). In other words, social dissatisfaction caused by
environmental problems will make people lose faith in the CPC and
China's political system, ultimately leading to regime collapse.
Therefore, the strong sense of danger regarding these issues aligns with
numerous campaigns Xi has proposed within and outside the party, such as
the 'Mass Line' education campaign beginning in 2013 and the 'Learning
Party History' education campaign beginning in February 2021. The
primary goal of these campaigns is to urge Communist Party members to
'remember the original heart and mission' (不忘初心, 牢记使命) to serve
the people, safeguard the party's vitality and achieve the country's
renaissance. Official Chinese sources further corroborate the
legitimacy-seeking framework's argument that domestic concerns, followed
by international considerations, are the primary driving factor behind
China's engagement in global governance. On 12 October 2015, Xi Jinping
outlined China's strategy for global governance during a joint study
session of the Central Politburo. Xi stated that China's primary
motivation for participating in global governance is to achieve its 'Two
Centenary Goals'Footnote4 and realise the China Dream of national
rejuvenation. In addition to prioritising domestic legitimacy, Xi has
used China's contribution to addressing climate change to enhance its
international legitimacy. Xi understands the importance of states
working through international institutions in today's world. He referred
to international institutions as effective tools for coordinating
international relations and managing conflicting interests, emphasising
that great power conflicts through war and colonisation had become
outdated (People's Daily Citation2015). This high-level conference
indicates that under Xi Jinping's leadership, China aims to play a more
significant role in shaping global governance, and climate change is one
area in which China can achieve its objectives. Moreover, China's
contribution to global governance should align with its national
interests. The issue of climate change serves as a juncture where
China's efforts to legitimise itself in both domestic and international
realms intersect. After Paris Agreement, China consistently
characterises its climate change policies as evidence of taking
international responsibility. Additionally, Xi Jinping has repeatedly
raised awareness among domestic officials about the significance of
addressing global warming. During the National Conference on Ecology and
Environmental Protection in 2018, Xi listed deepening international
cooperation among the six essential principles guiding China's efforts
to foster an 'ecological civilisation'. He issued directives with a
sense of aspiration,

**['We should deeply [participate in global environmental
governance]{.mark} and enhance our voice and influence in the global
environmental governance system]{.underline}**. We should **[actively
lead the direction of international order reform and offer solutions for
world environmental protection and sustainable
development]{.underline}**. We should adhere to environmental
friendliness and lead international cooperation in tackling climate
change' (Xi Citation2019).

Following Xi Jinping's announcement that China plans to achieve carbon
neutrality by 2060, he spoke at the Leaders' Summit on Climate hosted by
the US on 22 April 2021, calling for the international community to
create 'A Community of Life for Man and Nature' (人与自然生命共同体),
raising a new concept and slogan that explicitly links humanity and
nature. Through calls for the international community to exhibit
'unprecedented ambition and action', as well as to 'act with a sense of
responsibility and unity', Xi aims to increase China's 'discourse power'
and position China as a forerunner in global environmental governance
and multilateralism.

In sum, as China's paramount leader, Xi Jinping's personal preference
for environmental governance has pushed the renewal of China's climate
change policy since 2012. As the legitimacy-seeking framework explains,
the positive changes in **[China's climate policies have benefitted from
Xi's understanding of the congruence between domestic and international
legitimacy]{.underline}**. With climate change as a significant issue
during his tenure, **[Xi sees protecting the environment and addressing
global warming as an [opportunity to gain]{.mark}]{.underline}** both
**[[domestic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and international
**[[legitimacy]{.mark} for China]{.underline}**. Consequently, the
**[Chinese government has been [establishing more aspirational climate
change targets]{.mark} and taking more concrete measures, to [resolve
its domestic legitimacy crisis]{.mark} and boost its international
reputation and leadership.]{.underline}**

#### The plan's reversal of warming [eliminates]{.underline} polar trade routes which are [key]{.underline} to China's soft power.

Another important driver of China's Arctic policy remains the SLOCs.
[The **[B]{.mark}elt** and **[R]{.mark}oad**
**[I]{.mark}nitiative**]{.underline} expansion to the Arctic region [is
[built]{.mark} particularly [on]{.mark}]{.underline} the promotion of
[maritime [operations through the **NSR**]{.mark}]{.underline} along the
Russian coast in the Arctic Ocean[. [Due to]{.mark} the [**melting**
of]{.mark} **glaciers** and sea **[ice]{.mark}**, global
**[warming]{.mark}**, [and **climate** change]{.mark}, the
[Arctic]{.mark} region's vast **resource** [**wealth** has
been]{.mark}]{.underline} acknowledged as [[a new **economic**
**hinterland**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[region]{.underline}
[contains]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[**one-fourth**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the world's [unexplored [**oil** and
**gas**]{.mark}]{.underline} resources, in addition to other natural
resources. Therefore, [all these [factors combined stimulate
**China's**]{.mark} enhanced [aims]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as the
emerging geopolitical dynamics. [Greater [**demand** for
**energy**]{.mark}]{.underline} and hydrocarbon resources [[at home to
boost the]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic [**[econ]{.mark}omic**
scene]{.underline}[, [as well as]{.underline}]{.mark} the full
utilization of the [**[Arctic]{.mark}** **maritime**
**[routes]{.mark}**, emerge as [**significant**,
**economic**]{.mark}**ally** [helpful possibilities for
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Also, navigation routes such as the
[[**NSR** and the **NWP** are vital for the]{.underline}]{.mark}
expansion of the **[[BRI]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic region.
[China's [**proclamation** of being a near-Arctic
state]{.mark}]{.underline} [is]{.underline} its [attempt to
**[strengthen]{.mark}**]{.underline} its legal right to increase its
[**[influence]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[geopolitical [developments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this scenario,
[the white [paper clearly proclaims]{.mark} China's
[ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline} and how it [wants [to use the **Polar**
**Silk** **Road** to link]{.mark} its enormous **commercial** and
**infrastructure** **[projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Asia and Europe
through an extension of the BRI [[to the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Moreover, Chinese alliance and cooperation with other nations through
bilateral and multilateral means have become clear through policy
expansions. An example is China's collaboration with Russia for its
Yamal LNG project.31 Yamal is the linchpin of China's Arctic
infrastructure projects and signifies an "anchor" project intended to
establish a commercial presence that will eventually back all the
related investments in the region under the BRI umbrella.32 To move
forward in advancing maritime cooperation as part of BRI,
[[Beijing]{.mark} in 2017 declared [plans for
**three**]{.mark}]{.underline} purported "blue economic [[**passages**"
that will]{.mark} [connect **Asia**]{.mark} with [**Africa**,
**Oceania**, **Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and beyond.33 Among them,
there is a single passage route that links China with Europe through the
Arctic Ocean. It officially connects the BRI to Beijing's Arctic
interests, aims, and ambitions. China approaches the Arctic region from
multiple perspectives, including Beijing's interest in resources, trade
and investment owing to domestic requirements, and preserving a symbolic
presence in the geopolitics of the Arctic[. China's Arctic engagement
takes place through **bilateral** **partnerships**]{.underline}, mainly
with the European Arctic states, as well as multilateral alliances
through institutional engagement, largely the Arctic Council. In all
this, [Russia has]{.underline} so far [shown]{.underline} [a welcoming
attitude **toward** Chinese involvement in the **NSR**]{.underline} and
Arctic; however, the pace of Chinese involvement has been quite slow.
But [[China's]{.mark} strong **desires** and **[ambitions]{.mark}** are
[pushing it to quicken]{.mark}]{.underline} the pace as well as
"gradually increasing its participation in projects that represent its
crucial interests."34 China is also one of the most important nations
that is involved in international maritime trade.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is placed fourth in the ownership of
vessels around the world and [[executes **90 percent** of]{.mark} its
commercial [trade through maritime transport]{.mark}]{.underline}.35

It can safely be said that China's engagement in the Arctic is based on
win-win gains between China and various other players including Russia.
This has been underscored by participation in multilateral cooperation
with other Arctic nations and by being a part of Arctic Council. China's
emergence confirms its strengthening presence in global power politics.
In the Arctic, China's engagement tracks its official policy as declared
in its white paper highlighting its determination to sustainably utilize
opportunities to turn geopolitical dynamics in China's favor. Due to
repeated declarations by China regarding climate change and other
environmental threats, it has shown its intent to protect this region
from environmental hazards---that is, China is intent on projecting a
perception of being a concerned and accountable nation in the Arctic
region. However, it should be kept in mind that China is the largest
emitter of greenhouse gases globally, followed by the United States and
India.36 China's permanent membership at the United Nations Security
Council, observer status at the Arctic Council, and emergent bilateral
and multilateral partnerships with several Arctic nations allow China to
claim a legitimate presence in Arctic affairs. This claim is again
reaffirmed by [China's self-proclamation of being a "**near**-**Arctic**
**state**," with the [ultimate goal of
**reinforcing**]{.mark}]{.underline} the validity of its
**[[soft-power]{.underline}]{.mark}** presence in the Arctic.

#### Warming facilitates [easy access]{.underline} to the arctic for China. That's [key]{.underline} to their [soft power]{.underline}.

[[China's ambitions]{.mark} in the Arctic fall into **five**
**categories**]{.underline}. The PRC desires [[access for
**transoceanic** **shipping**]{.underline}]{.mark}, opportunities for
**[[resource exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the right to conduct
scientific inquiry, and a say in norm-setting and rulemaking. China's
fifth goal, rarely mentioned in formal documents, relates to strategic
and military uses of the Arctic. Officially[, China's Arctic [white
paper prioritizes]{.mark}]{.underline} the most noble and globally
acceptable of all of these goals---specifically, scientific exploration.
It describes the country's [goals as]{.underline} being [to
"[**understand**, **protect**, **develop** and **participate**
in]{.mark} the [**governance** of]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, so as to safeguard the common interests of
all countries and the international community in the Arctic, and to
promote sustainable development of the Arctic."7 It claims that China
"prioritizes scientific research, underscores the importance of
environmental protection, rational utilization, law-based governance and
international cooperation, and commits itself to maintaining a peaceful,
secure, and stable Arctic order."8 The themes of science, contributing
to global order, and norm-setting are repeated throughout the document,
which frames China's Arctic interests in nonthreatening terms. Chinese
officials assert [their country's [stake in the Arctic is]{.mark} a
"[geographical, natural, and social reality" made]{.mark}]{.underline}
evermore [[**prominent** by **climate** **change** and the **melting**
of]{.mark} the Arctic **sea** **[ice]{.mark}**]{.underline}.9 In June
2017, the National Development and Reform Commission and the State
Oceanic Administration (SOA) released the Belt and Road Initiative
Maritime Cooperation Plan, initially describing the "Arctic Passage"
(北极航道) as a new dimension of the BRI, a "Silk Road on Ice."10
[Chinese [experts noted]{.mark} that **[three]{.mark}** **maritime**
[passages]{.mark}]{.underline} connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans
through the Arctic: Northeast (around Eurasia), Northwest (around North
America), and Central (polar route through Arctic Ocean) (Figure 2.1).11
These experts contended that as these [passages]{.underline} become
ice-free for longer periods, they [[offer]{.mark} the prospect of
**[trade]{.mark}** **routes**]{.underline} 30 to 50 percent shorter than
using the Malacca Straits and the Suez Canal for transporting Chinese
goods to European and North American markets.12 The concept of a Polar
Silk Road was introduced in 2018 with the release of the Arctic white
paper, which was released after the original Action Plan on the Belt and
Road Initiative was published.13 The Chinese State Council's official
Belt and Road website now describes the Polar Silk Road as the shipping
routes that cross the Arctic and connect the major economic centers of
North America, East Asia, and Western Europe. Under the heading of
"Deepening Participation in Global Oceanic Governance[," the 14th
FYP]{.underline}, which was released in March 2021[, called for
"participating in **pragmatic** **cooperation**]{.underline} in the
Arctic [[to build the '**Polar** **Silk**
**Road**]{.mark}.']{.underline}"14 Figure 2.1 presents a China-centered
map of the three Arctic routes and the traditional route through the
Strait of Malacca and the Suez Canal. In Mia M. Bennett et al., 2020,
the Arctic scholars note that "China is the only country to have led
official expeditions of all three Arctic shipping passages, including
the TSR \[Transpolar Sea Route\]."15 Chinese experts assess that the
Northeast Passage, which includes what Russian defines as the Northern
Sea Route ([**[NSR]{.mark}**), [is the most **commercially viable**
passage as]{.mark} the **ice** **[melt]{.mark}** currently [**allows**
ships to pass]{.mark} for four months a year]{.underline}.
[Chinese]{.underline} and Russian [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[proclaimed]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[interest
in]{.underline}]{.mark} joint [[**development** of]{.mark} Arctic
**[energy]{.mark}**]{.underline} resources and the Northeast Pas-

sage since 2017.16 However, the two governments have yet to undertake
concrete projects to develop the waterway and have differing interests
and priorities in the region.17 In addition to the terms that Chinese
officials, analysts, and commentators use to discuss the Arctic, it is
also important to look more broadly at the overall level of importance
they ascribe to the region. Although a growing topic of interest, the
Arctic remains a relatively niche subject in Chinese writings on foreign
policy, defense, and security affairs. Chinese authors' analyses of the
Arctic's importance tend to focus on norm-setting to gain a voice and a
role, scientific exploration and environmental protection to put an
attractive public face on China's presence and involvement, and
economics and shipping to explain why it is crucial for China to have
access. Strategic motivations are rarely mentioned, and the region's
military importance is almost never discussed. However, a few [Chinese
**[scholars]{.mark}** have [underscored]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[strategic importance of]{.mark} well-planned [**access** to the Arctic
for]{.mark} protecting [**China's** **interests** and
**rights**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the international community and that
[the [Arctic has **significant** **military**
**value**]{.mark}]{.underline} and a potential locus of military
conflict.18 One of the few examples of PRC experts discussing the
strategic importance of the Arctic is a 2018 article by a group of
academics at Ocean University of China. These academics argue that
deepening participation in the [development of Arctic
**[passageways]{.mark}**]{.underline}, based on cooperation with Arctic
stakeholders, conducting scientific research, establishing rules and
regulations, and avoiding disputes, could [[increase]{.mark} China's
[**bargaining** **power**]{.mark}]{.underline} and lay the foundation
for route and resource development more generally.
[[Strengthening]{.mark} **China's** **[legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}
by participating [[in international legislation]{.underline}]{.mark} and
international organizational activities [could further
[strengthen]{.mark} the **PRC's** **[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and agenda-setting power, [[facilitating]{.underline}]{.mark} its
participation in the development and [utilization of [Arctic
**routes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[researchers]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[note]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[importance]{.mark} of developing
the Arctic Passage [for]{.mark} the **[econ]{.mark}omy**]{.underline},
pointing out that [new patterns of [international **cooperation**
and]{.mark} **global** **[shipping]{.mark}**]{.underline}, by
[[reducing]{.mark} **shipping** [**costs** and promoting **new**
**cargo** and energy]{.mark} corridors]{.underline}, could also [affect
the layout of China's **shipping** **routes**]{.underline}, especially
those originating from or concluding at its northern ports.19
Separately, scholars from Tsinghua University published an article in
2018 that introduced the concept of the Northeast Passage as the third
component of a "One Belt, One Road, One Channel" plan (italics added for
emphasis), illustrating some ways in which China might conceptualize the
strategic advantages of a developed Arctic Passage. The article suggests
that a [developed [Arctic Passage]{.mark} could [bring]{.mark}
**numerous** **advantages**]{.underline}, although the One Belt One Road
initiative by itself faces risks associated with geopolitical factors,
regional instability, cultural and religious differences, and energy
security vulnerabilities. There are few countries along the Arctic
Passage [and [little threat of]{.mark} **piracy**, making [**terrorist**
**attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} on overseas investments relatively
[easy to **guard** against]{.underline}. They also note that, compared
with the One Belt One Road plan, the Arctic One Channel is "less
troubled by illegal immigration and refugee influx."20 Other Chinese
scholars of maritime transportation have argued that the [Arctic
[Passage]{.mark} is [important to]{.mark}]{.underline} improving China's
[[energy security]{.underline}]{.mark} and that China can have greater
influence over the construction of the Passage as a "near-Arctic
country." Consequently, these experts concluded, "The earlier the
construction of the Arctic Passage begins, the earlier the future of
China's energy security will be determined."21 The Arctic Passage could
present a strategic benefit by reducing congestion in the Strait of
Malacca and the Suez Canal and lowering the possibility of China's
energy lifeline being choked off, something former Chinese leader Hu
Jintao called "the Malacca dilemma."22 A developed Arctic Passage also
offers efficiency advantages for the BRI. Chinese maritime experts
estimate that, compared with the traditional China-European Union (EU)
maritime shipping route that passes through the Suez Canal, the
Northeast Passage reduces the distance between Chinese and European
ports by 18 percent to 26 percent, favoring China's northern ports.
Additionally, though icy conditions can slow ship speeds, Arctic
container ships need not call at multiple ports like their counterparts
on traditional shipping routes. According to Chinese experts, [this
[reduces]{.mark} Arctic [**shipping** **times** by eight to 11
days]{.mark}]{.underline} [on]{.mark} average, [[saving]{.mark} both
[**time** and **fuel**]{.mark} cost]{.underline} as compared with the
traditional route.23 Shorter transportation times reduce energy
expenditure costs, and the Arctic route also provides a new connection
between China and the wealthy nations of northern Europe, meaning
[[China can]{.mark} more [easily **export**]{.mark} midlevel products
[and **import**]{.mark} advanced products.]{.underline} Opening the
Arctic Passage could also reduce costs and thereby increase the
competitiveness of certain industries. These generally optimistic
Chinese assessments of the viability of Arctic shipping diverge from
other international scholarly and commercial assessments that cite
hazardous conditions and limited support infrastructure as limiting
factors and reflect a degree of "boosterism" present in some Chinese
thinking about the Arctic.24

### L---Deep Sea Mining

#### Uncontested Chinese dominance of deep-sea mining is key towards Chinese "rejuvenation."

**Economist '24** \[The Economist, July 28, 2024, \"China is itching to
mine the ocean floor\",
<https://www.economist.com/china/2024/07/28/china-is-itching-to-mine-the-ocean-floor>\]
yc

SCATTERED ACROSS the ocean floor are trillions of lumps of nickel,
copper, cobalt and manganese. Companies have long wanted to mine them:
these "critical minerals" are needed in vast quantities to electrify the
global economy and cut dependence on fossil fuels. But
**[the]{.underline}** International Seabed Authority **[([ISA]{.mark}),
a UN body, is still figuring out how mining should be
regulated.]{.underline}** Some environmental groups want an outright
ban. Supporters and critics of deep-sea mining are hashing out these
issues at an ISA meeting in Jamaica between July 29th and August 2nd. Of
the 160-odd countries participating, **[few have more [interest
in]{.mark} the outcome than [China]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Demand for critical minerals might more than double by 2040 compared
with 2020, according to the International Energy Agency, a forecaster.
**[China is a big reason why. It makes most of the world's solar panels,
electric cars and batteries, all of which require such minerals. Last
year clean-energy industries accounted for [40% of]{.mark} the growth of
its [GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to the Centre for Research on
Energy and Clean Air, a think-tank in Finland. But **[China has to
[import]{.mark} many of the critical [minerals]{.mark} it uses. Its
manganese comes from South Africa, Gabon and Australia. Most of its
cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Its nickel largely
comes from the Philippines and Indonesia.]{.underline}**

**[These [dependencies worry China's leaders]{.mark}. They fear supplies
could be disrupted by political turmoil or pressure from rivals like
America. The scramble for critical minerals is "a new front for
strategic competition among global powers", says China's national
intelligence agency. Officials rank critical metals alongside oil and
gas in their importance to China's future. Deep-sea mining promises a
secure supply.]{.underline}** And it would occur in international
waters, beyond other countries' sovereign authority. In 2016
**[[Xi]{.mark} Jinping, China's leader, [said]{.mark} his country [must
get]{.mark} its hands on the "hidden [treasure]{.mark}s" of the
ocean.]{.underline}**

**[To that end, China has spent years [building up influence at]{.mark}
the [ISA]{.mark}, which has authority over the seabed in international
waters under the ]{.underline}**UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
(**[UNCLOS]{.underline}**). The ISA is largely financed by its member
countries, and China gives it more money than any other donor. In 2020
it also gave the ISA a training facility in Qingdao, a port city in
eastern China. At ISA meetings last year, some countries tried to
introduce a moratorium on deep-sea mining. They failed, in large part
because of pressure from China. Its goal is to create a permissive
mining regime that brooks no interference from other countries, says
Isaac Kardon, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a
think-tank in Washington.

In total the ISA has issued 31 licences allowing the holders to explore
for minerals in preparation for commercial operations. Three Chinese
miners---China Ocean Mineral R&D Association, China Minmetals and
Beijing Pioneer Hi-Tech Development---hold five between them, more than
any other country's miners. They are itching to start operations. Three
of the Chinese licences cover patches of seabed in the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone, an enormous region in the eastern Pacific Ocean
that holds quantities of critical minerals roughly equivalent to all
terrestrial reserves. The other two are in the western Pacific and the
Indian Ocean.

**[Companies typically mine in order to make money, but China's also
have grander concerns.]{.underline}** Take **[China [Minmetals]{.mark},
a state-run giant that has an exploration [licence for]{.mark} about
[7.3m hectares]{.mark} of ocean floor]{.underline}** (an area bigger
than Sri Lanka). In March its **[[chairman vowed to]{.mark} secure
mineral supplies in order to help "[rejuvenate]{.mark} the Chinese
[nation]{.mark}". Chinese companies must [expand
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [until]{.mark} they ["cannot be dislodged"
from]{.mark} global [supply chains]{.mark}]{.underline}**, he said.

Deep-sea mining involves sending a large robot to the seabed to hoover
up lumps of metal, known as nodules. A support ship then sucks up the
nodules through a pipe. All this is tricky because of the low visibility
and high pressure at the bottom of the sea. China's technology is not
quite cutting-edge. But it is getting there. In July a team from
Shanghai Jiao Tong University sent **[a test robot]{.underline}**
(pictured) to depths of below 4,000 metres to collect 200kg of material.
The robot was largely built **[from Chinese-made components, "[smashing
international monopolies]{.mark}", said China]{.underline}**'s state
media.

**[If commercial mining gets going, [Chinese companies]{.mark} might
well end up [leading the industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**, says Cory
Combs of Trivium, a consultancy. China can build ships and robots faster
than any other country. Its **[[officials have]{.mark} a [history of
lavishing]{.mark}]{.underline}** subsidies **[[on emerging
industries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And **[its deep-sea miners have a
giant domestic market for the riches they bring to the
surface.]{.underline}**

### L---Deterrence

#### US Threat Perception makes D.C. cautious, stopping China in their tracks.

**RAND '22**, RAND is an American nonprofit global policy think tank,
research institute, and public sector consulting firm. \[RAND, Dec 29,
"What Does China\'s Arctic Presence Mean to the United States?", RAND,

nr pande

**[[C]{.mark}oast [G]{.mark}uard cutter [spotted]{.mark} the
[ships]{.mark} during a routine patrol of the Bering Sea]{.underline}**,
north of Alaska: a guided missile cruiser and **[two smaller ships
[from]{.mark} [China]{.mark}, traveling in formation with four ships
from Russia.]{.underline}** The cutter followed until they split up and
dispersed.

The ships broke no rules and violated no boundaries. But their
**[appearance so close to the Arctic this past fall [raised concern in
Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}** nonetheless. **[For years,
[China]{.mark} has [worked]{.mark} to [establish footholds]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} that would give it access to rich
mineral deposits and shipping lanes, as well as a [greater]{.mark}
[say]{.mark} in [Arctic]{.mark} affairs.]{.underline}** That---and a
**[[strategic presence]{.mark} in a region [ringed]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} several [other]{.mark}
NATO [countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Researchers at RAND and the Swedish Defence Research Agency looked at
where China is operating in the Arctic, what it wants, and what that
could mean for regional security. **[They concluded that [China]{.mark}
has [made]{.mark} only limited [inroads]{.mark} in the Arctic, but
that\'s [not for lack of trying]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"The threat should not be inflated," said Stephanie Pezard, a senior
political scientist at RAND who specializes in Arctic security. "But at
the same time, **[[they have]{.mark} a [clear intent]{.mark} to
[not]{.mark} [be excluded from Arctic]{.mark} developments as the region
becomes more accessible.]{.underline}** The real questions are, How much
of a role do they want, and what does that mean for an Arctic nation
like the United States?"

Conditions in the Arctic have always been so extreme, the distances so
vast, that even rivals like the United States and Russia were forced to
cooperate there. But the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on
the planet. Sea routes that sailors and explorers have dreamed about for
centuries are starting to open. **[The [promise of]{.mark} Arctic
riches---[oil, minerals, trade routes, even fish]{.mark}---has started
to draw interest from far outside the northern latitudes.]{.underline}**

**[[China]{.mark} has [declared]{.mark} itself a "[near-Arctic
state]{.mark},"]{.underline}** a designation it invented to push for a
greater role in Arctic governance. It has dispatched research
expeditions, sought to establish mining and gas operations, and
envisioned a network of shipping routes crossing the Arctic, **[a "silk
road on ice."]{.underline}** It describes itself as an "active
participant, builder, and contributor in Arctic affairs," one that has
"spared no efforts to contribute its wisdom to the development of the
Arctic region."

In the Arctic, the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [sees]{.mark}
[China]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a potentially [destabilizing force,]{.mark}
with the economic and military power to try to bend the established
order to its liking.]{.underline}**

But in the Arctic, as in the rest of the world, the United States sees
China as a potentially destabilizing force, with the economic and
military power to try to bend the established order to its liking. The
**[[Pentagon]{.mark} [considers]{.mark} China its "[pacing
challenge]{.mark}" of the foreseeable future]{.underline}**. Its
**[[Arctic strategy]{.mark}, released in October, [pays]{.mark}
particular [attention]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the risk of [China]{.mark}
using commercial or scientific access to the Arctic for military
advantage.]{.underline}**

Researchers at RAND set out to document known Chinese activities in the
North American Arctic, which touches Alaska, Canada, and Greenland.
Their counterparts in Sweden focused on the European side, from Iceland,
through the Nordic countries, to Russia.

What they found: Especially in the North American Arctic, "there\'s not
a ton going on," Pezard said. **[[China]{.mark} has [invested]{.mark} in
a [handful]{.mark} of [mining]{.mark}
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark},]{.underline}** mostly chasing valuable
rare earth minerals. It has trade partnerships with Greenland and a
small stake in a zinc mine in Alaska**[. A [Chinese]{.mark}
[company]{.mark} [tried]{.mark} to [buy]{.mark} a shuttered [U.S. Navy
base]{.mark} in Greenland,]{.underline}** but the Danish government
quashed the idea.

China has used loans and infrastructure deals to prop open the door for
itself in countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. But the
countries of the North American Arctic have generally taken a hard look
at any proposed Chinese investments---and often a hard pass. Canada
blocked a \$150 million gold mine deal that would have **[put Chinese
interests too close to military installations.]{.underline}** Greenland
has held up plans for another Chinese mine over concerns about
pollution.

"We didn\'t see the more nefarious activities that we\'ve seen in other
parts of the world, like predatory lending or influence over local
decisions, that are more damaging to international norms," said Stephen
Flanagan, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND and former senior director
for defense policy and strategy at the U.S. National Security Council.
**["All of the governments are being careful in how they deal with
China. It\'s a \'buyer beware\' approach."]{.underline}**

RAND\'s study did not include the Russian side of the Arctic. That may
be China\'s best route to greater Arctic influence. The Arctic Council,
a governing body of Arctic States and indigenous nations, suspended its
meetings last year, refusing to engage with Russia after it attacked
Ukraine. A panel of experts that RAND convened for its study noted that
Russia could seek to form its own Arctic governing council, with a more
central role for its ally, China.

The experts thought that was possible, but not necessarily probable.
Despite its joint operation in the Bering Sea this past fall, and
codevelopment of a natural gas project in the Russian Arctic, Moscow has
also been wary of letting China pursue its ambitions so close to its
home shores. And rather than walk away from the existing council, Russia
has called for it to resume its meetings, with Russia back at the table.

For now, the U.S. should continue to make the Arctic a diplomatic,
economic, and strategic priority, to demonstrate its commitment to the
region and its people, researchers concluded. It should work to
strengthen solidarity among its Arctic allies---and explore conditions
under which it could restart some engagement with Russia, such as on
search-and-rescue preparedness.

But the **[[U.S.]{.mark} should also [recognize]{.mark} that
[engaging]{.mark} with China]{.underline}** in the Arctic does not have
to **[[be]{.mark} a [win-or-lose]{.mark} proposition]{.underline}**.
There are opportunities to cooperate---on climate change, for example,
or pollution control. China has already played a key role in
international agreements to protect Arctic fisheries and to create
maritime shipping regulations. On paper, at least, both China and the
United States are committed to ensuring the Arctic remains a region of
peace and stability.

The next few years will be a crucial test. If current projections hold,
**[the Arctic could see its first ice-free summer by
2030.]{.underline}**

#### **Increased domain awareness project power and scare away others.**

**The Watch '24,** The Watch is a professional military journal
published by United States Northern Command. \[The Watch, June 20, "Army
deepens domain awareness in Arctic combat", The Watch,

The Arctic presents challenges that don't exist anywhere else in the
world: extreme cold, wind, snow and ice and unpredictable weather
patterns. Not to mention an almost complete lack of infrastructure. But
the rapidly changing risk environment has made it expedient to train
U.S. troops in all types of roles for a potential conflict in the
region. [Maintaining a **[military]{.mark} [presence]{.mark}** and
capability in the Arctic is a [high priority for]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark} and an essential part of the mission for U.S. Northern
Command]{.underline} (USNORTHCOM).

An Army sniper recently offered a detailed portrait of what it takes to
excel in the Arctic environment while performing an extremely difficult
task: maintaining a sniping position for up to 10 hours at a time in
frigid conditions. Staff Sgt. Phillip Cho, a sniper in the 11th Airborne
Division in Alaska, collaborated on an essay with Business Insider, a
U.S. online news site, to describe how he has learned to thrive in the
Arctic. "What I've preached for years now is that in order to be
a successful sniper in the Arctic, you have to have imagination," Cho
told the news site in a story published in April 2024.

Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä, known as "The White Death," operated in
Arctic environments during World War II and was responsible for 500
enemy deaths. Cho said Army snipers have adopted many of Häyhä's tactics
into their training, including wetting the surrounding of the firing
point so when snipers fire, a plume of snow would not fly up in the
airand give their spot away, and putting snow in their mouths so it's
invisible when they breathe. "We've built many of our tactics,
techniques and procedures off of Häyhä's experience in that real war,"
Cho said.

Another Arctic lesson learned is to avoid breathing on equipment to
prevent it from freezing, something snipers don't have to worry about in
the jungle or desert, Cho said. On missions, Cho and a scout pack
supplies on a sled and wear enough layers of clothing to stay warm for
hours. Cho estimated his longest Arctic mission in one position was 10
hours. During the winter, the extra supplies may add 90 to 120 extra
pounds, he said.

Cho's experience is part of a [strategy to defend the Arctic and
increase **[domain awareness]{.mark}** outlined in the U.S. Army's 2021
Arctic policy. "Operating in the Arctic [allows]{.mark} the Army
[to]{.mark} **[powerfully project]{.mark}** our forces to
[enhance]{.mark} our [ability to respond in
**competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, crisis and/or conflict. This
enhanced Arctic capability will increase the Army's ability to operate
in extreme cold-weather, mountainous and high-latitude environments,"
according to a March 2021 Army news release.

In 2024, the Arctic Edge exercise demonstrated USNORTHCOM capabilities
across land, air and maritime domains. "ARCTIC EDGE is an annual,
multifaceted joint military exercise with international/interagency
partners participating. It enables NORAD, [USNORTHCOM, and components to
demonstrate operational capabilities that are [critical for]{.mark}
integrated [deterrence]{.mark}, layered [defense, and resilience]{.mark}
in the Arctic]{.underline}. Multinational operations/activities are a
tangible representation of U.S. commitment to our Allies and partners
and demonstrate our shared commitment to global security and stability,"
a March 2024 Department of Defense publication stated.

As Cho's account illustrates, the Arctic environment poses specific
challenges that require tailored technology, assets, infrastructure,
training and planning. The National Strategy for the Arctic region,
released in October 2024, seeks to "enhance and exercise both our
military and civilian capabilities in the [[Arctic]{.mark} as required
to [deter threats and]{.mark} to anticipate, [prevent]{.mark}, and
respond to both natural and human-made [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}.
We will improve our understanding of the Arctic environment and develop
whole-of-government capabilities to support expanding activity in the
U.S. Arctic region. We will deepen cooperation with Arctic Allies and
[partners in [support]{.mark} of these objectives and [to
**manage**]{.mark} **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline} of further
militarization or unintended conflict, including those resulting from
geopolitical tensions with Russia," the 15-page document states.

The **[[Arctic]{.mark} strategic environment is [changing]{.mark}
profoundly,]{.underline}** and the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
must [pay]{.mark} greater [attention]{.mark} and dedicate more resources
[to]{.mark} this crucial [area]{.mark},]{.underline}** said Iris A.
Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Arctic and
Global Resilience. 

Ferguson addressed the **[[increased attention]{.mark} that the
People\'s Republic of [China]{.mark} has [in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** She spoke at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies today. 

China is, by no means, an Arctic nation. But Chinese leaders see the
region as a new crossroads of the world, a new source of raw materials
and **[[new avenues for]{.mark} manifesting its growing
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**  

**[[China]{.mark} is [working]{.mark} closely [with Russia]{.mark} in
its attempt [to be seen as]{.mark} an [Arctic
power]{.mark},]{.underline}** Ferguson said. Even with Russia\'s unjust
war on Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin is investing heavily on
military and economic strategies in the Arctic. \"We\'re seeing Russia
continue to have immense focus on the Arctic region, and it\'s part of
their ... security calculus, vis-a-vis the U.S. and NATO,\" Ferguson
said. \"**[[Despite]{.mark} the attrition in [Ukraine]{.mark}, we
[still]{.mark} see them \... heavily [focused on the
region]{.mark}.\" ]{.underline}**

A shifting climate is speeding the pace of change in the region.
\"Climate change is still a factor in the region, where the region warms
at some four times the rate of the rest of the world,\" she said. This
means more access for settlements in the high North and **[more chances
for what she calls \"[competitor activity]{.mark}.\" ]{.underline}**

\"\[China\] is one of the newer entrants on the scene,\" Ferguson said.
\"Over time, the strategic interests that they have in the region are
... giving us pause. How their long-term vision for the region could
affect our interests, is \[also\] giving us pause.\"

**[Even more disturbing is the increasing levels of
[collaboration]{.mark} between Russia and China especially [in]{.mark}
the [military]{.mark} domain]{.underline}**, she said. Russia and China
exercised together in the Bering Strait in summer of 2023. \"Just this
past summer, right after we released our department \[Arctic\] strategy,
we **[saw a joint bomber patrol off of the coast of
Alaska.\"  ]{.underline}**

There has also been increasing cooperation between the Chinese and
Russian coast guards in the region. \"This kind of increasing levels of
military cooperation is new,\" she said. \"Certainly, it\'s new within
and around Alaska.\" 

The new DOD Arctic strategy is aimed at preserving the region as a place
that is both stable and secure, Ferguson said. She also discussed the
Defense Department\'s three main lines of effort in the region. **[The
[first]{.mark} is [enhancing domain awareness]{.mark} to see and [detect
threats]{.mark}, and to [ensure U.S.]{.mark} forces [can op]{.mark}erate
in the region [effectively]{.mark}.  ]{.underline}**

\"We\'re also really focused on engaging with our allies and partners,\"
she said. These nations are a unique U.S. strategic advantage that
stretches from the border of European Russia to the Bering Strait. These
are \"seven like-minded partners that are incredibly militarily capable
and also have heavy geostrategic alignment with us,\" she said.  

Finally, the United States is working on using military exercises in the
region. \"We\'ve long had exercises that operate in the region, but
we\'re really looking at how we can use those as a deterrent effect,
working alongside our allies and partners,\" she said.  

There\'s an **[[evolution in how competitors think]{.mark} about the
region]{.underline}**, Ferguson said. \"We\'re going to continue on the
DOD side to monitor military activity.\" 

But this attention cannot be just limited to that. The
**[[Chinese]{.mark} are [using other aspects]{.mark} of their national
power [to insinuate themselves]{.mark} into the region.]{.underline}**
China is involved in scientific and research projects in the region.
**[China is [looking]{.mark} to [establish]{.mark} [economic
ties]{.mark} within the Arctic.]{.underline}** \"We really just need to
be clear-eyed about some of their intentions and, how we can be like
**[thinking about their long-term interests and, [how we]{.mark} can
best [protect]{.mark} [ours]{.mark},\" Ferguson said. ]{.underline}**

### L---Domain Awareness

#### **Developing domain awareness technology will minimize China's strategic influence in the arctic**

The [[strategic utility]{.mark} of an [Arctic presence
is]{.mark}]{.underline} considerable for [**[early warning
purposes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Its geographical location makes the
Arctic an [important [vantage point for monitoring]{.mark} potential
[ballistic missile launches and]{.mark} other airborne
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 Russia and the United States---with its
allies---depend on Arctic infrastructure for their early warning
systems, both through ground-based radars and ground stations for
satellite communications (SATCOM). [Russia and [China are]{.mark}
increasingly collaborating in [developing defense
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}, decidedly prioritizing space and new
technologies, and it is with Russia's cooperation that China is seeking
to develop and deploy its own early warning infrastructure.13

More broadly, with their increasing dependence on space-based
capabilities for advanced warfare, [states seeking global or Arctic
regional coverage for their space systems are reliant on ground
infrastructure in the Arctic due to its latitude-restricting
coverage.]{.underline}14 The Arctic is also an ideal location for this
type of infrastructure. [Particularly for [states with ambitions of
global space-power projection such a]{.mark}s the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and China, [this incentivizes a **growing physical
presence** in the Arctic to support developing space
infrastructure,]{.mark} including dual-use projects.]{.underline}15
China has advanced its global space capabilities drastically in recent
years, and reports have emerged that Russia is becoming reliant on
Chinese satellite imagery of Ukraine.16 Moreover, the geopolitical
tension between NATO and Russia heightens the risk for assets such as
Norway's K-SAT satellite station on Svalbard and the space-launch
capabilities in Andøya, Norway, and Kiruna, Sweden.17

#### Domain awareness allows the US to have a greater presence in the arctic, increasing deterrence against China in the region

[The People\'s Republic of [China]{.mark}]{.underline}, not an Arctic
nation, [is [increasing]{.mark} its [presence in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The PRC operates three icebreakers
in the Arctic, for instance, and [has a military presence
there]{.underline} as well. The Chinese military has also demonstrated
its ability to operate in the Arctic by conducting operations with the
Russian navy, for instance.

\"While not an Arctic state, [the PRC [**seeks greater influence** in
the region, greater access]{.mark} to the region, [and]{.mark} a
[greater say in]{.mark} its [governance]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Hicks
said. \"That\'s concerning given that it\'s the only strategic
competitor with the will and increasingly the wherewithal to remake the
international order.\"

Russia\'s presence in the Arctic, including its military presence ---
the largest of all Arctic nations --- can hold U.S. and allied
territories at risk. At the same time, Russia is increasing its presence
in the Arctic by reopening Soviet-era military installations.

\"Russia continues to pose an acute threat to security and stability in
the region,\" Hicks said. \"Russia has continued to build up its
military infrastructure in the Arctic and assert excessive claims over
Arctic waters.\"

[[Russia is also partnering with China]{.mark}, Hicks said, and this
[presents additional concerns for U.S.]{.mark}
[defense.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"We\'ve seen growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia in the
Arctic, commercially, with the PRC being a major funder of Russian
energy exploitation in the Arctic, and increasingly militarily, with
Russia and China conducting joint exercises off the coast of Alaska,\"
Hicks said. \"All of these challenges have been amplified because the
effects of climate change are rapidly warming temperatures and thinning
ice coverage, and it\'s enabling all of this activity.\"

[The [DOD\']{.mark}s 2024 [Arctic Strategy]{.mark} addresses these
concerns in the Arctic with three lines of effort, including enhancing
the capabilities of the joint force, greater engagement with allies and
partners and exercising U.S. presence in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[\"Our Arctic strategy [adopts a \'monitor and respond]{.mark},\'
approach in the region,\" Hicks said. \"It is [underpinned by **robust
domain awareness** and intelligence]{.mark}, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities, cooperation with our allies and partners
and deterrent power enabled by the agility of the joint force. The
strategy focuses on enhancing our domain awareness and Arctic
capabilities, engaging with our allies and partners and **[exercising
calibrated presence in the]{.mark} [region.\"]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for arctic and
global resilience, said mission enhancement includes, among other
things, a focus on domain awareness in the Arctic.

[\"We must improve our [domain awareness]{.mark} and [enhance]{.mark}
our [ability to detect and respond]{.mark} with our Canadian allies to
threats to the homeland,\" Ferguson said. \"A key focus for my office is
championing investments that will enhance our awareness of threats in
the region.]{.underline} We want to make sure that we have the [right
sensing architecture and the right communications architecture for
command and control.\"]{.underline}

#### Domain awareness allows the US to take leadership over China in arctic tech 

**Leddy 20** \[Laura Leddy; Researcher at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory; 7-7-2020; China\'s Arctic Endgame; RFG;
https://rfg.org/chinas-arctic-endgame/; Accessed 7-21-2025; VB\]

The military implications of [[China's Arctic activities mean]{.mark}
the [U.S. must be prepared for]{.mark} renewed **[great power
competition]{.mark}** in the region.]{.underline} The current
administration is beginning to recognize this, as evidenced by Trump's
June 9 memo calling for a new fleet of polar icebreakers. Rather than
spend time and money arming these icebreakers, [however, the
[U.S.]{.mark} [should focus on]{.mark} a defensive posture emphasizing
**["technopolitics]{.mark}":** the interplay between **[technological
achievement and geopolitical success]{.mark}**. This would help
[preserve the Arctic]{.mark} as a [zone of peace]{.mark} while
[promoting U.S. leadership in]{.mark} realms like [domain
awareness]{.mark} and scientific research.]{.underline}

### L---Greenland

#### The US has proven it has the capability to push China out from Greenland's mining sector

**Hasanova 25** \[Tamilla Hasanova; Staff Writer at Caliber; 1-10-2025;
Reuters: US pushes Greenland rare earths developer to avoid selling to
China; Caliber;
https://caliber.az/en/post/reuters-us-pushes-greenland-rare-earths-developer-to-avoid-selling-to-china;
Accessed 7-17-2025; VB\]

In a bid to secure strategic control over critical mineral resources,
[[US]{.underline}]{.mark} and Danish [officials actively [lobbied the
developer]{.mark} [of Greenland\'s largest rare earths deposit]{.mark}
last]{.underline} year, urging the company not to sell the project to
firms linked to China.

Greg Barnes, CEO of Tanbreez Mining, confirmed to Reuters that US
officials visited the southern Greenland site twice in 2024, [delivering
[a clear message: **avoid Chinese-backed buyers at all
costs**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} per Caliber.Az.

Tanbreez Mining is working to develop one of Greenland's most promising
rare earths deposits, essential for industries like electric vehicles
and missile systems, where rare earth elements' magnetic properties are
vital. The US has shown increasing interest in Greenland's critical
minerals, a long-standing priority for Washington, long before
President-elect Donald Trump\'s recent comments about potentially
acquiring the territory.

Barnes explained that [[US pressure influenced]{.mark} Tanbreez's
decision [to sell]{.mark} the project to New York-based Critical Metals
(CRML), [rather than to Chinese firms, despite more lucrative
offers]{.mark} from China.]{.underline} Tanbreez will be sold in a deal
that involves \$5 million in cash and \$211 million worth of stock,
significantly lower than the proposals from Chinese companies, according
to Tony Sage, CEO of Critical Metals.

"The pressure was definitely there not to sell to China," Sage
confirmed. Barnes emphasized that Chinese offers were not seriously
considered, as they lacked clarity on payment plans.

Despite the political pressure, the sale of Tanbreez highlights a shift
in the rare earths sector. Analysts note that while the Tanbreez deposit
is large, its mineral composition is not the most commercially
attractive. David Merriman of Project Blue, a minerals consultancy,
remarked that the chances of the project reaching commercial production
are slim due to its complex mineralogy.

[The **[US appears to be gaining influence in Greenland's mining
sector]{.mark}**, securing rare earth projects that were previously
overlooked by investors]{.underline}. \"Greenland is not for sale, but
it is open for business,\" said Dwayne Menezes, head of the Polar
Research and Policy Initiative. He added that [Greenland would welcome
greater investment from the US]{.underline} as it continues to pursue
economic partnerships to develop its mineral wealth.

#### **Greenland will only partner with China if the US does not move forward with investments**

**Worcester 25** \[Nathan Worcester; covers national politics for Epoch

[A [Greenland]{.mark}ic official has raised the stakes]{.underline} in
the contest for its minerals, suggesting that the Danish territory
[[could **turn to China** if the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and Europe [[do not move fast
enough]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Greenland's minister for mineral resources, Naaja Nathanielsen, hinted
at that possibility in an interview with the Financial Times published
on May 27.

["We want to [develop our business sector and diversify it]{.mark}, and
that [requires investments]{.mark} from outside,']{.underline}' said
Nathanielsen, whose four-party coalition government was elected in
March.

When prompted about China, she said [that [Greenland seeks "to partner
up with]{.mark} European and [American partners."]{.mark}]{.underline}

["[But if they don't show up]{.mark}, I think we [need to look
elsewhere,"]{.mark}]{.underline} she added.

Neither Nathanielsen's ministry nor Denmark's foreign ministry responded
to requests for comment from The Epoch Times by publication time.

Greenland has zinc, gold, copper, and many other minerals, including an
estimated 1.5 million tons of rare earth resources.

[President Donald Trump previously cited those critical minerals to
explain his interest in acquiring the world's largest
island.]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark}, which presently dominates global rare earth mining and
processing, [has]{.mark} also [sought to]{.mark} [develop Greenland's
rare earth resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}

During the Biden administration, the United States lobbied a firm
involved in the Tanbreez rare earth play, urging it not to sell to a
Chinese-linked buyer.

Not far from Tanbreez, a uranium and rare earth element project that had
investments from the Chinese firm Shenghe Holdings was stopped short in
2021 when the Greenlandic government banned uranium mining.

Nathanielsen was involved in that effort.

In March, the CEO of the Bank of Greenland told Bloomberg that the
European Union or the United States must guarantee purchases of critical
minerals from the island.

That same month, [China's state news agency reported that [Greenland's
new foreign minister expressed **interest in more cooperation with that
country**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

In April, Greenland and Beijing agreed to streamline China's access to
Greenlandic fish exports.

#### The plan directly trades off with China's Greenland mining agenda

// bryce

Once seen as a remote [Arctic wilderness, **[Greenland]{.mark}** has
[emerged as a **geopolitical hotspot**]{.mark} in the 21st century.
Beneath its icy terrain lies a trove of critical minerals ---
**[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements**, uranium, zinc and
nickel --- [key to powering]{.mark} the green energy transition and
[high-tech industries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[As the climate warms and ice retreats, [global powers]{.mark} are
[racing to secure access]{.mark} to these resources.]{.underline} [The
**[US]{.mark}**, **[China]{.mark}**, and the **[EU]{.mark}** have [all
staked political]{.mark}, [economic]{.mark} and [strategic claims on
Greenland]{.mark}'s future.]{.underline} But their [[competing
approaches]{.mark} not only [shape Greenland's mining
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [they [also carry]{.mark} profound
[implications for **Arctic governance**]{.mark}, **[economic
development]{.mark}**, **[great power rivalry]{.mark}** and Greenland's
path toward greater autonomy]{.underline}.

Greenlandic authorities responded to public concerns about radioactive
waste while signalling wariness of growing Chinese influence.

The mineral wealth beneath the ice

Greenland's geological makeup positions it as a future leader in the
supply of critical raw materials. According to the Geological Survey of
Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), the island is home to significant reserves
of rare earth elements (REEs), uranium, zinc, iron ore and niobium.

The Kvanefjeld project in southern Greenland, originally led by
Greenland Minerals Ltd. and backed by Chinese interests via Shenghe
Resources, was set to become one of the world's largest REE and uranium
mines. However, in 2021, Greenland's new government banned uranium
mining, effectively halting Kvanefjeld's development.

This decision was both environmental and political. Greenlandic
authorities responded to public concerns about radioactive waste while
signalling wariness of growing Chinese influence. Yet the appetite for
mining remains strong. Greenland has issued dozens of exploration
licenses, and new projects --- like zinc mining in Citronen Fjord or
rare earth prospecting in Sarfartoq --- continue to attract
international interest.

The US has taken a strategic approach to Greenland's resources, viewing
them through the lens of national security and supply chain resilience.
In 2019, President Donald Trump famously floated the idea of purchasing
Greenland --- a move dismissed as absurd by many, but underscoring
Washington's deepening interest in the island. The same year, the US
signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)with Greenland to support
sustainable mineral resource development. The next year, the US reopened
its consulate in Nuuk and launched initiatives through the Department of
State and US Geological Survey to support mining partnerships.

[[Through]{.mark} the **[D]{.mark}efense [P]{.mark}roduction
[A]{.mark}ct** [and]{.mark} the **Industrial Base Analysis and
Sustainment** ([IBAS]{.mark}) program]{.underline}, the [US **Department
of Defence** ([DoD]{.mark}) began [funding rare earth supply chains free
of Chinese involvement]{.mark}]{.underline} --- including those
potentially based in Greenland. [These efforts [aimed to]{.mark} secure
critical materials for the defence and technology sectors and [reduce
dependency on China]{.mark}-dominated [supply]{.mark}
chains.]{.underline}

However, developments under the last two US administrations suggest a
cooling of the relationship. Greenland's Minister for Business and
Mineral Resources Naaja Nathanielsen noted that the MOU on mineral
cooperation signed during Donald Trump's first term has expired, and
efforts to renew it under President Joe Biden were unsuccessful. In May
2025, she criticised Trump's renewed suggestion that the US might
acquire Greenland, calling it "disrespectful and distasteful". Her
remarks reflect a broader sentiment in Greenland that US engagement in
mining should be grounded in equal partnership and respect for
Greenlandic sovereignty.

This reflects Nuuk's realist approach to foreign engagement --- China
remains a viable partner, provided it adheres to Greenland's conditions,
including respect for sovereignty, environmental safeguards, and
transparency.

China's cautious yet persistent presence

[[China]{.mark} has long [eyed Greenland as part of]{.mark} its
[Arctic]{.mark} economic [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its 2018 Arctic
Policy White Paper [declared China as "Arctic stakeholder" and
highlighted [**scientific research**, **infra**]{.mark}**structure**[,
**energy**]{.mark} and [**mineral development**]{.mark} as [key
interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Chinese firms, such as Shenghe Resources
and [**China National Nuclear Corporation** ([CNNC]{.mark}), have
[attempt]{.mark}ed [to invest in Greenland]{.mark}ic
mining,]{.underline} notably in the Kvanefjeld and Isua Iron Ore Project
Mine.

However, these efforts have encountered political headwinds. Greenland's
2021 uranium ban was widely interpreted as a rebuke to Chinese
involvement. In 2019, Danish intelligence reportedly warned that China
sought to establish dual-use infrastructure in Greenland that could
serve strategic or military purposes. This has increased Western
wariness about Chinese investment.

Nonetheless, [[China]{.mark} remains [engaged in
Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its firms continue to hold minority
stakes in certain projects and explore partnerships. [Beijing's global
**[B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative** and growing
Arctic diplomacy [make Greenland]{.mark} a continued [focal point for
resource]{.mark} diplomacy]{.underline}. As [global demand for REEs
intensifies, China may recalibrate its strateg]{.underline}y ---
balancing commercial interest with lower-profile engagement to avoid
geopolitical friction.

Despite these constraints, Greenland has signalled a pragmatic openness
to Chinese investment, warning that "if the US and EU do not act, we may
turn to Chinese investment". This reflects Nuuk's realist approach to
foreign engagement --- China remains a viable partner, provided it
adheres to Greenland's conditions, including respect for sovereignty,
environmental safeguards, and transparency.

Greenland welcomed the EU's initiative, but Nathanielsen noted that the
bloc has yet to translate its intentions into tangible investments.

### L---Icebreakers

#### The plan's icebreakers crowd out Chinese soft power in the arctic.

To this day, the [[waters off]{.mark} the **[Alaska]{.mark}n** coast
[supply]{.mark} our nation with critical **[petroleum]{.mark}**,
**[fish]{.mark}** stocks [and **deep**-**sea**
**minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, the [**[U]{.mark}nited**
**[S]{.mark}tates** [is losing]{.mark}]{.underline} strategic ground in
the Arctic [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} our adversaries Russia and
[**[China]{.mark}**. A [decisive tool]{.mark}]{.underline} in that
rivalry [[is]{.mark} the **[icebreaker]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a vessel
[[**uniquely** equipped to **cut** through]{.mark} deep layers of
[**Arctic** ice]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Russia has the world's largest icebreaker fleet, numbering over 40 total
with three more under construction and a dozen planned in the next
decade. [**[China]{.mark}**, too, [is **building** **ice** **breakers**
and **investing**]{.mark} in Arctic infrastructure.]{.underline} By
contrast, the [[U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} Coast Guard [[has]{.mark} just
[two]{.mark} **polar** [icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}: the Polar Star
and the Healy.

Until recently, those two ships divided their efforts at opposite poles
--- the Polar Star resupplying the McMurdo Station in Antarctica, and
the Healy protecting U.S. interests in the Arctic. A recent shipboard
fire aboard the Healy has put half of America's polar icebreaker fleet
out of commission. As a result, the Polar Star is now America's only
operational polar icebreaker.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} unfortunate turn of events has
[[created]{.mark} new [space for]{.mark} Russia and [China to
exert]{.mark} **maritime** **[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both
powers are [continuing to [invest heavily in]{.mark} Arctic-capable
[**assets** and **erode** **American**
**influence**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This summer, the Russian Navy conducted its largest war games exercise
since the Cold War near Alaska. Russia has also reopened over 50
previously closed Soviet military facilities and positioned early
warning radar and missile systems near Alaska.

[[China]{.mark} is **[upping]{.mark}** its polar
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} by pouring money into the
construction of a fifth Antarctic research station, completing its
second polar icebreaker and conducting six expeditions to the Arctic. In
recent years China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," achieved
permanent observer status on the multinational Arctic Council [and
[announced]{.mark} its "[**Polar** **Silk** **Road**]{.mark}" economic
[ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [Arctic is a **geopolitical** convergence
point]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Without]{.underline}]{.mark} new
[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark} in polar capabilities, **[our
[adversaries\' influence will grow]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The risk is
less protection of U.S. commercial and scientific vessels, weaker
enforcement of international law, and an increasing threat to our
national security.

#### Icebreakers are [key]{.underline} for soft power in the Arctic. China leads [now]{.underline} but the aff will will [crowd it out]{.underline}.

Russia. 3. Russia intends to develop its power in the Arctic through the
jurisdiction of the NSR by imposing stiff conditions for its use. Once
it has made the route profitable, it will allow it to take a more
aggressive stance by requiring the presence of Russian pilots onboard of
ships transiting the northern route, in addition to imposing the
contracting of icebreakers to ensure safety in navigation. In this way,
exhaustive control of the route is ensured and episodes such as the
French Navy ship free transit would be avoided. The United States will
push to make the Northeast Passage an international waterway with the
same status as the Straits, where coastal countries cannot prevent the
innocent passage4 of ships. However, the US is not a signatory to UNCLOS
(1982), an inconsistency that will make it difficult to defend this
point. 4. [The **transpolar** **route** will limit the **monopoly** that
Arctic states have on Arctic routes]{.underline}. The possibility of
[[transit through **international** **waters** will **reduce**]{.mark}
the **[power]{.mark}**]{.underline} of Russia, on the one hand,
[[and]{.mark} the **[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the country
that comes to exercise authority in the Northwest Passage, on the other
hand (see point 5). It seems that [**[China]{.mark}** could be
**[preparing]{.mark}** the most for this scenario]{.underline}, as [it
would be the main [**beneficiary** due to]{.mark}]{.underline} its
relative proximity to the Arctic and its [[**economic**
**capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark} that would allow it to build a fleet
designed to operate in these conditions. Its
[[uninterrupted]{.underline}]{.mark} scientific research in the Arctic
and the [[construction of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**-powered
**[[icebreaker]{.underline}]{.mark}** are indications [[pointing to the
**Arctic** as]{.mark} one of [**China's** **strongest**]{.mark}
[bet]{.mark}s in the mid-term]{.underline}. 5. A gloomy landscape looms
the Northwest Passage. Will Canada be able to defend its position as
sovereign country over the waters of the Northwest Passage or will it
give in to the US push? The reality is that only the awkwardness of the
diplomacy of the current Trump administration could explain why the US
has not proposed a win-win agreement to seduce the executive led by
Justin Trudeau. The [[American **soft** **power** is not]{.mark} at its
[best]{.mark} mean[while]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia [and [**China**
continue to seize]{.mark}]{.underline} the opportunity to gain
[[ground]{.mark} that will take the US a **great** **effort** to recover
it]{.underline}. The appearance of the Arctic new maritime routes
necessarily implies the loss of relevance of the traditional maritime
routes and current choke points. The hardest-hit could be the Suez Canal
due to the main oil importers will have closer sources of supply and in
more politically stable areas.

### L---India **[Science]{.underline}** Co-op

#### Expanding scientific collaboration with India [crowds out]{.underline} China's influence. The brink is [now]{.underline}.

The [[U.S.]{.mark} is **[expanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} its
long-standing [[**scientific** **collaboration**]{.mark}**s** [with
India]{.mark}]{.underline} ---as both countries prioritize strengthening
their science and tech foundations and try to [[counter
**China\'s**]{.mark} ever-growing **[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Why it matters: The Biden administration is trying to build \"a stable
base in the Indo-Pacific.\" [[India]{.mark} is [**challenging**
**China**]{.mark} to become the voice of the Global South]{.underline}.
[[**Science** is]{.underline}]{.mark} a lever of
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** both are pulling to try to achieve
those goals.

What\'s happening: There have been people-to-people and
institute-to-institute collaborations and partnerships for decades, but
the [deepening [support]{.mark}]{.underline} of government-to-government
[[could make **collaboration** easier]{.underline}]{.mark}, says Sudip
Parikh, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS).

\[Breaks Pause\]

The U.S. and India, along with Israel and the UAE, announced a new joint
space venture last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
President Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20
earlier this month announced a joint initiative focused on biotechnology
and the India-U.S. Global Challenges Institute, a network of
universities in the U.S. and India aimed at advancing science and tech
in the two countries. The National Science Foundation has invested
nearly \$150 million in more than 200 joint projects with India in the
last five years, including 35 this year focused on AI, edge computing
and other emerging technologies, NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan
said during his G20 visit to India. Those followed a host of other
science, space and emerging tech initiatives the two countries announced
over the last year. Where it stands: The growing U.S.-India research
partnership is fueled in part by India\'s large diaspora in the U.S.
More than 720,000 scientists and engineers born in India emigrated to
the U.S. in 2019 and make up nearly 30% of the foreign-born U.S. STEM
workforce. The diaspora is also influential: Google, IBM, CRISPR
Therapeutics, the NSF, the AAAS and the White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy are all helmed by people born in India or of
Indian descent. Zoom in: Government funding is often directed to
universities that have been a venue for collaboration between the U.S.
and India for decades, starting with exchanges between students and
scholars in the two countries. India has been \"a critical partner\" for
the University of Chicago for a long time, says Juan de Pablo, the
university\'s executive vice president for science strategy. Those
partnerships continue to grow: As part of the G20 announcements, the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay joined the Chicago Quantum
Exchange, a quantum science research hub based at the University of
Chicago.

\[Breaks Resume\]

\"Currently, there is less risk within India, but that may change in the
future,\" de Pablo says, in comparison [to [**scientific**
**partnerships** with **China**]{.mark} that [are under]{.mark} intense
**[scrutiny]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the U.S. \"We did not anticipate
that this was coming and look at where we are now.\"

Reality check: **[[China remains the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates\'
[main]{.mark} scientific [partner, though]{.mark} the [growth]{.mark} in
collaboration has [slowed]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

\"There\'s no way that India can replace China in the relationship in
science and technology,\" says Caroline Wagner, who studies
international science collaboration at Ohio State University.

Between the lines: In a paper not yet peer-reviewed, Wagner and Georgia
Tech professor Travis Whetsell measured the research capacity of the
world\'s countries.

On core technical capacity, India ranked in the top 10, aside the U.S.,
China, Japan and others. But when factoring in governance issues ---
academic freedom and control of corruption --- both India and China
dropped out of the top 30 countries.

The big picture: The deepening partnership has geopolitical and economic
goals, as well as scientific ones.

\"[Both [**New** **Delhi** and **Washington** see]{.mark} strong
[reasons to **counter** **China**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" says Michael
Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center,
adding there have also been a series of tracks in the U.S.-India
relationship that don\'t relate to China, including economic cooperation
that began in the early 1990s.

[[India]{.mark} is [trying to **generate** \"**alternatives**, providing
**new**]{.mark}**er**, **[different]{.mark}** more [**desirable**
models]{.mark} than **China**]{.underline} [\... [to **pitch**
itself]{.mark}]{.underline} to the world [[as a **rising**]{.mark}

The Arctic region consists of a plethora of unexplored areas of
hydrocarbons currently present on the Earth. Besides that, the region
also constitutes deposits of minerals such as copper, phosphorus,
niobium, platinum group elements and rare earths.11) India will be a
great support to Arctic States in order to conduct surveys to access
their optimum potential. Whereas, increasing human activity needs to be
checked on a regular basis to determine their impact on the environment.
[**[India]{.mark}** is [looking]{.mark} forward [to
**collaborating**]{.mark}]{.underline} with Arctic States,
[**strengthening** partnerships for [**sustainably**
**exploring**]{.mark}]{.underline} living and non-living resources in
the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.12)

[[**Chinese** **involvement**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region has
also [significantly **[increased]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even if none of
these topics are addressed in the Arctic strategy, [[China's]{.mark}
projection]{.underline} of itself [as a "**Near** **Arctic** **state**"
and]{.underline} its [[desire in constructing the **Polar** **Silk**
**Road**]{.underline} [make]{.underline}]{.mark} [it [impossible to
ignore]{.mark}]{.underline} the elephant in the room. Due to its
geographical location, [[India]{.underline}]{.mark} may not have the
same interest in the NSR passage, but the country's Arctic policy
[[recognises]{.mark} the [**potential** of the Arctic Sea
route]{.mark}]{.underline} and its potential to replace the conventional
Suez Canal route in the future.

[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}, the third-largest maritime nation, [is
[eager to take part in]{.mark} environmental **[monitoring]{.mark}** and
**[regulation]{.mark}**, [**safety**, and]{.mark} capacity [**building**
in]{.mark} the **ice**-**covered** [region]{.mark}]{.underline} because
it does not want to miss out on future potential in the area.

The [Chennai Vladivostok [Maritime Corridor]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
crosses the South China Sea, [is intended to]{.underline} boost
bilateral trade between India and Russia while also [[**limiting**
**China's** **influence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [By [reducing shipping
**costs** and]{.mark} the amount of [**travel**
**time**]{.mark},]{.underline} the International North-South Transport
Corridor (INSTC), a multimodal freight corridor[, is marketed as [a
**substitute**]{.mark} for both [the]{.mark} **Chinese** [**Polar**
**Silk** **Road**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the Suez Canal route as part
of China's Belt and Road programme. The INSTC is advocated as being
necessary for the "overall development of the hinterland and the
indigenous communities, more than the East-West connectivity," according
to the Policy. [[India is aware of]{.underline}]{.mark} how regional and
[global **[geopolitics]{.mark}** are **[changing]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the current situation brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and
how the global political landscape is changing. All these factors will

Instead, **[[China builds alignment with economic incentives as well as
coercion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This grants the Party an **[economic
tool with which to create shared interests]{.underline}**. However,
China does not have any formal alliances with any nation, outside of
North Korea, and only Pakistan and North Korea are long-term partners.
At the same time, Beijing has forced countries to choose between
recognizing the Mainland and Taiwan.

All this means that **[China lacks and has lacked "natural" or "organic"
cooperation partners and alliances]{.underline}**. Beijing in general
appears unwilling to build alliances. This can be traced back to the
overall framework that dictates China's foreign policy: in effect, the
hierarchical worldview and Chinese exceptionalism hinders
alliance-building. This is not surprising given China's cultural hubris
in addition to its cultural distance from potential foreign allies. In
fact, regionally in East Asia, where Beijing would enjoy cultural
affinity with its neighbours, historical relations have created mutual
mistrust to the extent that only North Korea remains an ally of sorts.

Overall, given China's past and present aggressiveness, there appears to
be willingness in Beijing to reconstruct its past empire. This does not,
however, include the building of alliances, unless the immediate
situation calls for an interim solution. There are several interests
between Moscow and Beijing that may or may not align. Starting before
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a policy discussion has been taking
place regarding the alignment between the two countries. The debates
centre around the issues of whether the alignment is growing stronger or
weaker and to what extent, and in which ways Moscow and Beijing can work
together to challenge the US, the EU, NATO, and the Western-backed
liberal world order. The cooperation between Russia and China has been
called a "limited entente",153 a "strategic straddle",154 an "emerging
alliance/eternal rivalship",155 and a "limited no-limits"156
relationship, to name just a few.

This section taps into these debates and discusses the shared and
non-shared interests of both actors. While the focus is on global and
transatlantic perspectives, the section is divided into thematic
subsections that discuss aligning and non-aligning interests. The former
consist of aims to diminish US influence and seek multipolarity. The
latter include the limits to a Sino-Russian partnership, which are
placed in a framework of contested geopolitics, that is, various
regional issues. The section also investigates the vulnerabilities of
Moscow and Beijing through both domestic and international lenses.

Aligning interests

For both **[[regimes, it is vital to appear strong and in
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ultimately, **[[the domestic
legitimacy]{.mark} of both [depends on maintaining a powerful
appearance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In both cases, in effect, **[[all
other interests]{.mark} can be [said to serve the core interest of
regime preservation.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The view shared by Moscow and **[Beijing]{.underline}** is that despite
Western democracies being in decline, **[[Western
liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** still presents a **[[threat
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russian and **[[Chinese internal stability and
regime legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Both authoritarian
**[states]{.underline}**, thus, **[view the [value basis of liberal
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g. rule of law, human rights) **[[as
an existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Hence, Moscow sees Beijing
as a viable alternative partner to Euro-Atlantic states, whereas for
China, Russia provides important support in competition against the US[.
**[It is in the interests]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of both states [to
argue and show that democracy is a weak and unstable system of
governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Both also appear equally dissatisfied
with the current Euro-Atlantic security regime and, more generally, the
current Western-led international order.

In addition, the main objective of Moscow is to strengthen Russia's
position as one of the new influential global power centres. The
**[[Chinese defensive posture]{.mark} is also [built on a perception of
the current international system favouring the democratic
West]{.mark}]{.underline}** in general, and the US in particular. The
shared aim of **[Moscow and Beijing, therefore, is to change the
international order]{.underline}** from within to make it serve US
interests less, and Russian and Chinese interests more.157

Diminishing US presence and influence Russian authorities assess that a
global power shift is taking place in the world. New **[[economic and
political forces are emerging]{.underline}]{.mark}**, leading to changes
in the structure, systems, rules, and principles of the world order.
This **[[intensifies the struggle for spheres of influence]{.mark} among
the emerging powers]{.underline}**.158 In this context, one of Russia's
main goals on the international scene is to diminish the role and
influence of the so-called "collective West".

[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [Defense Secretary]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[Japan]{.mark}** was [**crucial** to]{.mark} helping
**[tackle]{.mark}** potential [**Chinese**

Hegseth made the comments as he announced the implementation of a plan
to upgrade the US military command in Japan is set to get under way.

\"[We share a **warrior** **ethos** that defines our

Nakatani at a meeting in Tokyo.

\"[[Japan is]{.mark} our **[indispensable]{.mark}** partner [in
**deterring** **communist** **Chinese**]{.mark}]{.underline} military
aggression,\" including [[across]{.mark} the **[Taiwan]{.mark}**
**Strait**]{.underline}, he said.

Hegseth also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.

Focus on protecting Taiwan Strait

In July, former President Joe Biden\'s administration announced a
large-scale overhaul of the US military command in Japan, as [the [two
countries labelled **China**]{.mark} their \"[greatest]{.mark}
**strategic** **[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

Beijing has stepped up military pressure in recent years around Taiwan,
including near-daily air incursions, and has not ruled out using force
to bring the self-ruled island under its control.

\"America is committed to sustaining robust, ready and credible
deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait,\"
Hegseth said, using Washington\'s term for the Asia-Pacific region.

Partnerships required despite \'America First\' agenda

President Donald Trump had said during his first term that Japan should
pay more to host US troops and complained that the bilateral defence
treaty, in which Washington pledges to defend Tokyo, is not reciprocal.

[[Japan]{.mark} currently [hosts **50,000** US **military**

power.

\"President Trump has made it very clear, and we reiterate, we are going
to put America first. But [[**America** **first** does not mean
**America** **alone**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Hegseth said.
\"[[**America** and **Japan** stand **firmly** **together** in the face

WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - [[Senator]{.underline}]{.mark} Dan
Sullivan on Wednesday [[urged **Japan** and]{.mark} other U.S.
[**allies** in **Asia** to get behind]{.mark} a multibillion-dollar
[**gas** project]{.mark}]{.underline} in his home state of Alaska,
[[warning]{.mark} that [if they were not interested]{.mark} in buying
the gas, strategic **rival** [**China** would be.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Sullivan, a Republican, said he would not be surprised if the project,
involving a \$44 billion gas pipeline in Alaska, comes up when President
Donald Trump meets Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White
House on Friday.

Officials familiar with the matter have told Reuters [that [**Japan** is
considering]{.mark} offering [**support** for the
**pipeline**]{.mark}]{.underline} as it seeks to court Trump and
forestall potential trade friction.

Japan has doubts about the viability of the proposed 800-mile pipeline
-- intended to link fields in Alaska\'s north to a port in the south,
where gas would be liquefied and shipped to Asian customers -- because
of the overall costs of the gas relative to other sources. But it is
prepared to offer to explore a deal if asked, the officials said.

Sullivan told Washington\'s Center for Strategic and International
Studies it was a great opportunity for Japan, as well as U.S. allies
South Korea and Taiwan.

\"I think they need to be a little bit forward leaning, because if they
don\'t, you know, we\'ll move on to other places,\" Sullivan said.
\"[That\'s [**not** my **preference**, to sell]{.mark} this [to
**China**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but if the Chinese want]{.mark} to
**step** **up**]{.underline} and be an anchor tenant, and

allies to [reduce]{.mark} their **trade** [**deficits** and
**tensions**]{.mark} with the U.S.]{.underline}

position.]{.underline} During the Second World War, Greenland's position
was especially significant for the United States, which took advantage
of icy relations between Denmark and its colony, and established
thirteen army bases and four naval bases there.. Greenland was
exceptionally relevant to American foreign policy because having control
of the region meant blocking enemy access to North America. It also
served as a key transit point to Europe, a strategic location to obtain
forecast information, and had many valuable minerals which could be
exploited.11) After the end of the Cold War, most of the US bases were
dismantled, and currently only the Thule Air base is still operational,
regulated by the Igaliku Agreement. The closure of its many military
bases on Greenland meant a reduction in the American influence on the
island. However, Greenland's strategic position is still very attractive
for many other states, not only for its geographical position, but also
because of the presence of onshore and offshore hydrocarbon deposits and
mineral basins. By mapping the undiscovered oil and gas basins in the
Arctic territory not yet exploited, Donald L. Gautier et al.12) have
revealed the proximity of many of them to Greenland's coasts. According
to the U.S. Geological Survey's, [the region [consists of the "25% of
the world's]{.mark} [undiscovered hydrocarbon resources along with
9]{.mark}% of the world's coal and [other]{.mark} economically [critical
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}".13) According to another report, the U.S.
Geological Survey (2008) estimates as follows: "[a mean of [7.3 billion
barrels]{.mark} of oil and a mean of 52 trillion cubic feet of
undiscovered natural gas]{.underline} in the West Greenland--East Canada
Province north of the Arctic Circle". Greenland is also interested in
expanding its rights beyond the 200 nautical miles: following the
process regulated by UNCLOS Annex II, art. 4, the Danish government and
the Greenlandic self-government have submitted the necessary information
concerning the areas both North and South of Greenland to the UN
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in an effort to extend
their territory.14)

Even though [[China strives for establishing]{.mark} what Chinese
President Xi Jinping has defined as the "[New
normal]{.mark}]{.underline}",15) a [[domestic-driven economic
model]{.mark} and a mid-to-high-speed growth with higher efficiency and
lower cost]{.underline},16) from the tenth China's Five Year plan
(2001-2005), it has turned its attention to nations and regions that
possess significant natural resources in order to enhance its energy and
mineral sector.17) From this point of view, [[Greenland]{.mark} may be
[considered]{.mark} an [extremely relevant partner]{.mark} for China due
to its [rich deposits]{.mark} [of **iron**, **zinc**, **rare earth
elements**, and **uranium**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rare earth elements
consist of 17 different minerals, including uranium, that are mainly
used in the automotive industry, and for manufacturing magnets and
weapons. They occur together and the separation process consists of an
extremely polluting process that takes place in the first instance at
the mine and later in the processing plants that may be a different
place.

Although [[China]{.mark} has very large [reserves]{.mark}, its iron ore
has always been [classified as low grade]{.mark}]{.underline}. From
2010-2011, many low grade deposits have been exploited, reaching a
domestic production of iron ore of 1.32 billion tons. While China's
economic growth started to slow down after 2012, supplies from overseas
deposits continue to increase.18) Even though China has 30% of the
global reserves of the rare earth elements, it produces more than 80% of
the global output.19)

### L---Nuclear Power

#### China [relies]{.underline} on [exporting]{.underline} nuclear energy to the [US]{.underline}. The aff [stops]{.underline} those exports, [decking]{.underline} soft power.

Dependence on Adversaries and the Importance of the Other Low-Carbon
Power Source: Nuclear

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** dominates global supply chains for
renewable energy and batteries and [is]{.underline} now setting its
sights on [[becoming a superpower in **nuclear**
**energy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.11 China understands the simultaneous
need for clean baseload power in the form of nuclear (despite China's
current heavy reliance on coal) in addition to intermittent renewable
energies. Over the past several decades, as the West has grown
increasingly cautious about nuclear, **[China]{.underline}** has forged
ahead and [is now [building **twenty**-**five**
reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}, more than the next six countries
combined.12 In fact, [it has [more **nuclear** **reactors**]{.mark}
under construction [than any other nation]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
world, and approved ten new reactors in each of the past two years.13
The country is expected to surpass France and the United States to
become the world's leading atomic power generator by 2030, according to
BloombergNEF.14 It also is responsible for a new breakthrough: a
meltdown-proof nuclear reactor, which has been a goal for several U.S.
companies like X-energy and Kairos, as well as the U.S. Department of
Defense, but which China is building faster.15

[China's]{.underline} new [[**nuclear** **dominance** would be added
to]{.mark} its [**control** of **solar**, **wind**]{.mark}, and
**[EVs]{.mark}**]{.underline} (through the magnetic motor and
lithium-ion battery supply chain).16 It already processes 90 percent of
rare earth elements and 60 to 70 percent of lithium and cobalt (which
China manufactures with very low environmental and labor standards).17
Overall, [the **[U]{.mark}nited** **[S]{.mark}tates** [is
**reliant**]{.mark} on other countries]{.underline} for its critical
minerals, needing to import more than half its supply of thirty-one out
of the thirty-five minerals defined as critical by the government in
2018; the country also has no domestic production at all for fourteen of
those minerals.18

The United States must double-track its energy efforts just as China
has: work to increase nuclear power as a workhorse that can ensure the
United States has reliable electricity, while also (re)establishing
domestic renewable supply chains and manufacturing. In other words,
America needs to build---and lead---in multiple forms of energy.
Unfortunately, it seems the United States cannot get out of its own way.

According to a 2022 International Energy Agency (IEA) analysis that
describes the path to reach net zero by 2050, the world would need to
double its nuclear energy capacity even with the assumed exponential
growth in solar and wind.19 The IEA's model assumes an average of 30
gigawatts of new nuclear capacity coming online every year starting in
the 2030s and staying on that track for another two decades, until 2050.
The math then becomes clear: the world needs to build and turn on the
equivalent of 180 more 1,000-megawatt reactors, or twenty-five more new
reactors per year, by 2030, with further growth afterward in order to
hit the 2050 target.20

[If]{.underline} all of those [reactors are built by
**China**]{.underline} and Russia, not just for their domestic use but
also for export, [[other countries]{.mark} will be [**locked**
**into**]{.mark} their tech and [**supply** **chains**]{.mark} for
decades]{.underline}. Russia supplies more than 40 percent of the
world's enriched uranium, including about 20 percent of what the United
States uses, which means one in twenty American households were powered
by Russian-enriched nuclear fuel in 2022.21 Fortunately, lawmakers
passed the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, signed by President
Joe Biden in May 2024, which bans unirradiated low-enriched uranium from
Russia or Russian firms from being imported into the United States, with
the goal of increasing U.S. production.22 The law includes nearly \$3
billion in federal funding to expand the domestic uranium industry in
hopes of building demand, and will also help build new low-enriched
uranium supply (which is what current reactors use as fuel) as well as
create capacity to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU, which
is what advanced and next-generation reactors use as fuel). Adding
Russia and China together, these two U.S. adversaries control nearly 60
percent of the world's supply of enrichment needed to fuel the next
generation of reactors.23

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[intends to
build]{.underline}]{.mark} a total of [**[150]{.mark}** new nuclear
**[reactors]{.mark}** between]{.underline} 2020 and 2035[, which
includes]{.underline} a target of [[selling thirty]{.mark} **nuclear**
**reactors**]{.underline} via its Belt and Road Initiative [[to
states]{.underline}]{.mark} it considers its vassals.24 And thanks to
its massive state support system, China can build a lot cheaper[:
[it]{.mark} has already [bid]{.mark} [to build **Saudi**]{.mark}
**Arabia['s]{.mark}** fi[rst]{.mark} **nuclear** plant]{.underline} at a
price at least 20 percent lower than competing bidders.25

China now seems to be at least a decade ahead of the United States in
nuclear power, specifically because of its ability to field
fourth-generation reactors; is poised to build six to eight new nuclear
power plants each year; and is expected to surpass the United States in
nuclear-generated electricity by 2030.26 China is expected to finish its
first commercially operating SMR by 2026, while leading U.S. advanced
nuclear firm TerraPower is expected to be online by 2030.27

In addition, the current U.S. nuclear fleet is aging. The vast majority
of American nuclear capacity was built between 1970 and 1990, with the
country's newest plant (Plant Vogtle's AP1000 reactor in Georgia)
completed in 2024.28 The United States should not wait decades to
commission its next nuclear power plant; it is down from its peak of 112
reactors in 1990 to ninety-four operating today.29 Moreover, now is the
time to double down on U.S. nuclear development and leverage a domestic
workforce that has recently absorbed the know-how of nuclear reactor
construction from Vogtle---what economists call diffusion of knowledge,
which is essential for economic dynamism and innovation.30 The longer
the United States waits to construct a reactor, the more it risks a
brain drain of the first batch of expertise gained in decades: some
14,000 workers (including engineers, welders, masons, electricians,
mechanics, and support staff) helped to construct the Vogtle plant and
could be deployed to build another AP1000 as quickly as possible to keep
domestic know-how alive and to maintain nuclear power momentum.31

Meanwhile, [[China]{.mark} is taking the same approach]{.underline} with
nuclear that it took with other forms of green energy:
[[establish]{.mark} and [subsidize **domestic**
**capacity**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a foundation [[for
competitive]{.mark} reactor **[exports]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Beijing's
"dual circulation" strategy to keep its economy from being reliant on
imports, particularly from the West, was even enshrined in its
constitution.32 It has successfully created Chinese dominance in mineral
processing and overcapacity in clean tech, which are killing many
domestic producers, not just those in the United States.33 China also
got a great deal of help from the United States: one of the main U.S.
nuclear firms, Westinghouse, agreed to license its tech to China over
several years, even agreeing to allow China to export its
technology---which seems like unwise policy in retrospect.34 Beyond that
voluntary tech transfer, China's military also hacked Westinghouse and
stole its "confidential and proprietary technical and design
specifications for pipes, pipe supports, and pipe routing within the
AP1000 plant buildings," as well as sensitive emails, according to the
U.S. Department of Justice indictment.35 (Russia has also been charged
with hacking Westinghouse in an effort to steal the company's IP.)36

4.4. Competing in a changing international nuclear market [[**China\'s**
efforts to reform]{.mark} domestic [**governance** and promote
**nuclear** **exports**]{.mark}]{.underline} are [[embedded in]{.mark} a
[changing]{.mark} **international** nuclear
**[market]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in which [China is [**competing**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia, South Korea, and [[the US for
**market** **share**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even before the
Russian-Ukraine war, the capacity of Russia to fulfill its contracts was
already questioned \[9\]. More complications arose following the western
sanctions against Russia, starting in February 2022 in response to its
invasion of Ukraine. Examples from Finland, Egypt, and Turkey may help
highlight the dilemma faced by Russia and import countries. Finland
signaled that the Russia-backed nuclear project Fennovoima Oy would no
longer be able to acquire a construction permit, the granting of which
was previously expected in 2022 \[112\]. Russia\'s project in Egypt,
which was scheduled to start construction in 2020, was postponed until
mid-2022, due to the COVID-19. Egypt\'s vote against Russia\'s invasion
of Ukraine at the UN General Assembly might further delay the
construction of its first nuclear power plant \[113\]. Unlike Finland
and Egypt, Turkey restated its intention to cooperate with Russia in
nuclear power development by approving a bill that sets the national
nuclear regulatory frameworks and authorizes several concessions to
Rosatom in March 2022 \[114\]. It is likely that the majority of
Russia\'s projects will be affected by the Russia---Ukraine war and that
certain ongoing projects might be suspended and later resumed by a
country other than Russia. As Russia is withdrawing from the
international nuclear market[, China still faces]{.underline} two strong
competitors---South Korea and [the **US**.]{.underline} South Korea has
been known for its centralized energy policy-making and strong state
involvement in nuclear energy development \[115\]. However, the former
President Moon Jae-in, elected in 2017, declared a plan to phase out
nuclear energy over a period of 45 years. This national plan was soon
revoked by the new President Yoon Suk-yeol, elected in 2022 \[11,116\].
The new President pledges to strengthen the use of nuclear energy and
make South Korea an important nuclear exporter \[117\]. Following its
successful sale to the UAE, KEPCO who had been marketing to Turkey,
Jordan, Romania, and Ukraine, and is now focusing on Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Kenya, Philippines, Vietnam, and the Czech Republic \[11\]. The
[[US]{.mark} has [**historically** used]{.mark}]{.underline} commercial
trade in [[**nuclear** **technologies**]{.underline}]{.mark} as a tool
[[to exert **political** **leverage** in]{.mark} international
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline} \[118\]. Among international nuclear
cooperations between 2000 and 2015, the US\' dominance remains prominent
in nuclear safety and security \[119\]. However, doubts have been raised
regarding the influence of the US in maintaining international nuclear
safety standards and preventing nuclear proliferation in the context of
a declining export industry \[120\]. The passages of the Nuclear Energy
Innovation Capabilities Act and the Nuclear Energy Innovation and
Modernization Act in 2018 and the American Nuclear Leadership Commission
Act in 2020 demonstrate a strong commitment by the government to revive
its nuclear sector and maintain the US\' leadership in nuclear
technology \[121\]. Furthermore, the US announced its plan to advance
its cooperation with South Korea in overseas civil nuclear markets by
promoting supply chain collaboration \[122\]. Despite Russia\'s
withdrawal, international competition in nuclear exports will be fierce
in the foreseeable future. The intensified competition based on
construction time, overnight costs, and financial packages may further
be complicated by changing international relations[. Although
[China]{.mark} is able to secure its nuclear **exports** to Pakistan and
Argentina]{.underline}, its nuclear [[deal with Romania was
**canceled**]{.underline}]{.mark} in January 2020 following the
blacklisting of CGN in August 2019 over the alleged theft of US nuclear
technology and the US---Romania MOU on strategic civilian nuclear
cooperation in September 2019 \[123,124\]. Challenges and opportunities
coexist. [[New dynamics of **supply**]{.underline}]{.mark} and demand
are likely to [**[reshape]{.mark}** the **[global]{.mark}** **nuclear**
**[market]{.mark}**]{.underline} and it remains
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} be seen [[whether **China** has a]{.mark}
better [chance]{.mark} of **[exporting]{.mark}** its **nuclear**
**[tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline} in the absence of Rosatom.
Evidently, continuous domestic governance reforms that facilitate wider
standardization, better regulations, and flexible financing would help
China to make the most of the opportunities.

### L---Research

#### U.S Arctic research crowds out China.

**Volpe 25** (Marco Volpe\[Ph.D. Candidate at the Faculty of Social
Science at the University of Lapland. Visiting Researcher at the Arctic
Centre, Arctic International Relations Team.\], "China's Domestic
Discourse on Status-Building in the Arctic", 4-1-2025,
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-3073-8_10//phs-DZ)

Recently **[[China]{.mark} has [consistently increased]{.mark} its
[production of]{.mark} scientific knowledge that pertains to [Arctic
research]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Bibliometric studies show a steady
increase in Arctic research output since the mid-1990s, and China has
shown the strongest relative growth (Andreeva & Høneland, 2023). Web of
Science, the bibliometric database used to measure, evaluate and track
scientific research, shows the growing number of Chinese scientists
publishing about the Arctic region. **[[The fivefold increase]{.mark} of
Chinese scientists in the percentage [of]{.mark} total scientific
[articles on]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} from 2000 to 2024 has [occurred
concurrently with]{.mark} a significant [decrease in]{.mark} the
proportion of [scientists from the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, and
to a lesser extent Canada, publishing on the topic.]{.underline}** Among
the studies two locations stand out: the central Arctic Ocean and Gakkel
Ridge, a mountainous formation on the sea floor (Laundriault, 2024). The
increase in Arctic research capabilities is attributed to annual
research expeditions. In 1999, China launched its inaugural Arctic
research expedition using the icebreaker Xuelong, acquired from Ukraine.
By 2004, China established its Arctic research station in Ny-Alesund,
Norway. Since 2008, **[[China]{.mark} has [conducted research
expeditions]{.mark} almost [every year]{.mark}, and in 2020, it
commenced operations [with]{.mark} its first [domestically-built
icebreaker]{.mark}, Xuelong 2. A [third icebreaker]{.mark} is currently
under construction, [poised to further enhance]{.mark} China's capacity
for [scientific research]{.mark} in polar regions. This significant
[enhancement in scientific research]{.mark} capabilities
[demonstrates]{.mark} China's [robust financial investment]{.mark}. [It
positions China as a leading actor]{.mark} [in]{.mark} conducting
systematic [research activities]{.mark} in areas beyond national
jurisdiction]{.underline}** (e.g. the Central Arctic Ocean). This
development aligns with the precautionary principle, which is at the
foundation of the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement (CAOFA) and
advocates for better environmental understanding before conducting
large-scale fishing activities in these regions. Since 1996, China has
been a member of the International Arctic Scientific Committee (IASC),
established in 1990 by the representatives of national scientific
organizations from the eight Arctic States to facilitate cooperation in
the Arctic research community and promote advanced multidisciplinary
research. IASC also hosts the International Polar Year (IPY) whose
research includes international research on climate change and
environments, observation of the Arctic and assessment of climate
impacts on the Arctic. China hosted the IASC annual meeting in 2005 in
Kunming (Yaxin, 2020). **[As an observer member of the Arctic Council,
[China]{.mark} attends sessions and [takes part in]{.mark} the work of
the Arctic Council [working groups]{.mark}. In 2018, China became a
signatory to the CAOFA, aimed at preventing overfishing in the Central
Arctic Ocean]{.underline}**. **[China's [participation]{.mark} is not
merely seen as that of a distant-water fishing state, but as a
[reflection of]{.mark} its [enhanced capability in scientific
research]{.mark}, [bolstering]{.mark} its [role in Arctic
governance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This treaty marked a significant
moment as the first Arctic-related international agreement not
exclusively negotiated among Arctic states, but also involving
non-Arctic states (if we exclude the Svalbard 196 M. VOLPE Treaty). It
underscores the growing involvement of non-Arctic states in Arctic
affairs and acknowledges science as a crucial factor operating in areas
beyond national sovereignty, falling under international regimes.
Initially, negotiations focused on a Declaration Concerning the
Prevention of Unregulated High Seas Fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean
among the Arctic Five (United States, Russia, Norway, Denmark and
Canada). However, Iceland's objections to this format led to the A5+5
format, which included China, South Korea, Japan, the EU and Iceland
itself in the second phase of negotiations. This culminated in the
formal signing of the treaty on 3 October 2018 (Vylegzhanin et al.,
2020). Chinese Nordic Arctic Research Center (CNARC) is also a relevant
Chinese initiative devoted to scientific research. When it was
established, in 2013 in Shanghai, it included ten founding institutions,
six Nordic and four Chinese, which have now been expanded to a total of
eighteen (nine Chinese and nine non-Chinese). The network comprises
research centres, universities and polar institutes with the common
purpose of providing a platform for academic cooperation and increasing
awareness and undertaking of the Arctic region (Nielsson, 2023).
According to prof. Yang Jian, its success relies on "building a
diversified, efficient, and open Arctic academic exchange network by
means of academic conferences, economic roundtables, visiting scholars
and academic exchange" (Yang, 2017, p. 293). CNARC organizes a yearly
symposium that gathers experts, academics and practitioners from many
Chinese and Nordic institutions and provides fellowships to visiting
scholars and academic exchanges.

### L---Shipping/NSR

#### The NSR is key to China's long term soft power in the arctic.

**Gricius 21** (Gabriella Gricius \[BA Boston University International
Relations: Security Studies and Europe Focus, PhD Colorado State
University Political Science\], "Geopolitical Implications of New Arctic
Shipping Lanes", 3-18-2021,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/geopolitical-implications-arctic-shipping-lanes///phs-DZ)

Despite these obstacles, this **[[renewed regional interest]{.mark} may
[lead to increased geopolitical tensions]{.mark}. Increasing traffic
brings the possibility of unknown ships close to many of these country's
coasts in a way that they are not familiar with]{.underline}**. States
then must determine how to control their northern borders in harsh
climates and territories that, until recently, were impassable. Without
some kind of vigilance over their borders, Arctic states may also run
the risk of facilitating or falling victim to increased transnational
crime. For example, unknown ships also bring with them unknown purposes,
of which many could be illegal fishing or even illicit trafficking.
Further**[, the [development of the NSR and NWP]{.mark} also presents
possible issues. Unresolved disputes about the sovereignty of these new
sea routes may [be problematic]{.mark} when shipping does eventually
become an option. [China and Russia's cooperation on]{.mark} the
[development of the NSR]{.mark} also [brings]{.mark} with it [concerns
about Chinese influence in the Arctic]{.mark} as well as American
hand-wringing about a closer relationship between Russia and
China.]{.underline}**

The Northern Sea Route

Although the Northern Sea Route (NSR) was first opened by the Soviet
Union in the 1930s, it has not been a reliable transit route for many
decades due to ice coverage.^4)^ However, with the increasing melting of
the polar ice caps, the NSR is looking more and more like a potential
transit route. However, there are geopolitical implications concerning
the NSR that raise interesting questions. Perhaps the most basic
geopolitical consideration is who has power over the NSR. Russia has
claimed that the NSR lies within its territorial waters, giving it
exclusive rights to develop the area and to patrol ships.^5)^ The United
States and other powers have disputed this claim, which has led to an
interesting paradox where neither side recognizes the veracity of who
can control this passageway. Interestingly, Canada does recognize
Russia's claim over the NSR as Russia recognizes Canada's claim over the
NWP (*See below*).

Another **[geopolitical concern is the development of the NSR. While the
[United States has failed]{.mark} for many years [to express
interest]{.mark}, not all states have taken such an approach.
[China]{.mark}, for example, is [working with Russia to develop]{.mark}
the [NSR as China sees]{.mark} the [route as important for its national
economic interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Although the investment is
hugely expensive and time consuming, [China clearly sees]{.mark} the
[development of the NSR as playing]{.mark} the [long
game]{.mark}.]{.underline}**^6)^ While the route may not be usable now,
in a few decades, that could easily change. **[Geopolitically, [this has
huge implications]{.mark} as [it brings China and Russia closer]{.mark}
together as allies and encourages both states to develop more
icebreakers -- a necessary tool to navigate the region.]{.underline}**

#### The NSR is the vital internal link to preventing soft power decline.

icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- a "historic investment in US

frontier", according to the White House.

As **[Washington increases its focus on the region, [China]{.mark} -- a
"Near-Arctic State" and observer of the Arctic Council -- [must seize
new shipping opportunities]{.mark}, according to Zhang Cheng and Su
Anqi, scholars at Wuhan University.]{.underline}**

"**[[Arctic shipping routes offer advantages in terms of cost and
efficiency]{.mark} over traditional routes, [making them a potential new
pathway to counter US geopolitical containment]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"
they wrote in the June issue of China Review.

"**[[By]{.mark} enhancing its hard power \[in shipping\] and [reshaping
soft rules]{.mark}, [China can effectively respond to geopolitical
competition in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**," they said.

### I/L---Arctic Key

#### Chinese Arctic [influence]{.underline} is key to [continuity]{.underline} in their security and development policy---the plan [disrupts]{.underline} their [transformation]{.underline} into a "modern socialism"

On October 16th, Xi Jinping presented the Report to Congress. While the
2017 Report celebrated China's global rise through soft power, the last
one highlights how the changed external environment presents increasing
challenges for China,1) ranging from slowdown of the global economy to
some regional conflicts and disturbances. As Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine has shaken major power relations, national security
received much more attention. **[Xi Jinping speaks about [holistic
national security, emphasizing food, energy, resources, supply
chain]{.mark} and technology, and mentions of the word
"security]{.underline}**" (**[安全]{.underline}** -- anquan) **[[almost
doubled]{.underline}]{.mark}** compared to the 2017 report.

While **[[the focus on national security]{.underline}]{.mark}**
influenced by global instability shows new priorities in Xi Jinping's
agenda, **[for [China's Arctic policy]{.mark}, it might represent a
[vital element of continuity]{.mark}]{.underline}** by further endorsing
international cooperation in the region. The typical cold-war concept of
security is principally based on prioritizing state-centric military
security over environmental degradation. From the early 1990s,
environmental security played a pivotal role in Arctic states agendas
and encouraged Arctic stakeholders to build common ground. **[[China has
gradually improved its Arctic scientific research]{.mark} engagement
[and technological capabilities]{.mark} [through regional governance
mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as the Arctic Council Working
Groups and as a member of the International Arctic Science Committee
(IASC).

Science and technology

In the 2022 Congress Report, an entire section is dedicated to science
and technology (科技 -- keji), which are mentioned more often than in
the previous report in 2017.2) **[Science and technology are [addressed
as a "primary productive force" for China's transformation into
a "modern socialist country]{.mark}",]{.underline}**3) suggesting that
Beijing will improve a self-reliant technological system, lessening
dependence on foreign aid and pursuing national economic development.

The Congress Report states that China: "will increase investment in
science and technology through diverse channels\[...\] We will expand
science and technology exchanges and cooperation with other countries,
cultivate an internationalized environment for research, and create an
open and globally-competitive innovation ecosystem."4) **[When speaking
about the Arctic, science and technology are tightly
linked]{.underline}**. Particularly, **[[icebreakers enhance]{.mark} the
possibilities of conducting Arctic [scientific research]{.mark}. China
has improved its icebreaker fleet in the last decades]{.underline}**,
and its third polar icebreaker might be ready for 2025.5) From the
perspective of the US, the upgrading of China's Arctic scientific
capabilities is oriented to conduct also intelligence and military
applications in the region.6)

**[Advancements in technology and science in [China's Arctic
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (published in 2018) **[are [developed
through]{.mark}]{.underline}** scientific **[[cooperation: "China will
improve]{.mark} the capacity and capability in scientific research on
[the Arctic, pursue a deeper understanding]{.mark} and knowledge of the
Arctic science]{.underline}** \[...\] supports pragmatic cooperation
through platforms such as the International Arctic Science Committee,
encourages Chinese scientists to carry out international academic
exchanges and cooperation on the Arctic, and encourages Chinese higher
learning and research institutions to join the network of the University
of the Arctic."7) Based on this formulation, we can anticipate that
China will work on enhancing scientific cooperation opportunities in the
Arctic.

China's capabilities to conduct joint scientific research in the Arctic
region are strictly connected to international cooperation and
influenced by China's relations with the Arctic States. It also depends
on China's status as a non-Arctic country with no sovereign rights in
the region and solid interests in boosting its influence. As an observer
to the Arctic Council, China "has to demonstrate political willingness
as well as financial capability to contribute to the work of the
Permanent Participants and other Arctic Indigenous peoples."8) China has
to consider the almost three-year absence of Chinese scientists from
main research bases as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the new
precarious political situation between the Arctic States due to the war
in Ukraine and the skepticism about military-end usage of its polar
icebreakers. These factors might induce China to take a step-by-step
approach that sticks to the cooperative approach, meaning that it will
prioritize its well-established scientific projects and partnerships in
Norway and Iceland. Recently, Chinese researchers have told Voice of
America (VOA) that there are plans to immediately resume work in two of
the most important Chinese outposts in the Arctic: in Svalbard to the
Yellow River Station in Ny-Alesund, which is operated by the Polar
Research Institute of China (PRIC); and in Iceland to the China Iceland
Arctic Research Observatory (CIAO).9) The work of the Arctic Council has
suffered a slowdown. Its probable reshaping may not change the necessity
for China, as a non-Arctic country, to respect Arctic states'
sovereignty rights, and show its commitment to the work of the working
groups and its financial capability to improve scientific knowledge.
Restoring the work at the research bases might help let things work
again, and the existing scientific collaboration might provide common
ground to enhance cooperation. However, most of the work will
undoubtedly depend on the evolution of the war in Ukraine and on the
ability to keep the Cold War mentality from regulating international
relations in the region. On its side, China is also intensely interested
in not compromising its relations with the Arctic-7. Therefore,
engagement in scientific cooperation is also seen as a way to stay
caught up in this frozen mode of the Arctic relationship, where China
still shows great interest. Community with a shared future The concept
of a "community of common destiny" was first mentioned by former CCP's
General Secretary Hu Jintao at the 17th National Congress in 2007. Xi
Jinping has slightly modified the concept into "a community of shared
future."10) Both concepts are based on the idea of common destiny. What
slightly changes is the concept's dimension and projection at the global
level. During Hu's era, the concept was mainly shaped and endorsed to
manage relations with neighboring countries, especially Taiwan. In Xi's
era, the concept has been elevated to a new way of looking at
international relations. Its ambitiousness lies in the win-win strategy
where all stakeholders benefit from global cooperation, offering an
alternative model to the East-West dichotomic perspective. For example,
massive projects like the Belt and Road Initiative are deeply rooted in
a globalized economy and a willingness to create an economic
infrastructure where many stakeholders might share benefits. The
Congress Report discusses this concept in the 14th section: "China is
committed to its fundamental national policy of opening to the outside
world and pursues a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up. It
strives to create new opportunities for the world with its own
development and to contribute its share to building an open global
economy that delivers greater benefits to all peoples".11) The
endorsement of economic globalization and the creation of shared-benefit
platforms in the Arctic means the development of the maritime economy
through blue economic corridors. The maritime economy is categorized
into three sectors: marine fishery and aquaculture industries; salt
industry, offshore oil and gas, mining, and shipbuilding industries;
transport industry and coastal tourism.12) China's "Vision for Maritime
Cooperation on the Construction of the Belt and Road", jointly released
in 2017 by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the
State Oceanic Administration (SOA), suggests the creation of three blue
economic corridors, one of each is the Arctic corridor. In their
investigation of the role of the blue economy passages, scholars Jiang
and Chen (2019) highlight how maritime partnerships are based on the
strategy of ocean power (海洋强国 -- haiyang qianguo) and the principle
of shared future (命运共同体 -- mingyun gongtongti).13) While the
authors suggest the ASEAN model of regional cooperation for the first
two blue economic passages, for the Arctic, they look at medium and
long-term strategy mainly based on relations with Russia. So far, the
development of the blue economic corridor in the Arctic has led to
improving bilateral relations between Russia and China, mainly through
LNG exports to China along the Northern Sea Route. While the statement
in the Congress Report advocates for creating opportunities generating
global and shared benefits, the development of the blue economic
corridor in the Arctic has privileged bilateral relations between China
and Russia. The conceptualization of the community with a shared future
fits well in the Arctic region where, besides well-defined terrestrial
border systems among the Arctic States, international waters of the
Central Arctic Ocean provide the chance to claim equal rights. Article
137 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),
while providing legitimate rights in international waters to all
parties, also fits in the community approach to global and common
heritage narrative. China's signing of the Agreement on banning illegal
fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean embodies the concept of a shared
future and common destiny, and shows its commitment to creating a new
legal instrument to safeguard international waters where no state can
exert sovereign rights. From the economic perspective, the envision of
global and shared benefits must face the new polarization of powers,
which has mainly enhanced bilateral relations with Russia. On another
side, it helps China improve its image as a respectful actor and its
role in international politics as a contributor to the law-making
process. Multilateralism In the first section of the 2022 Congress
Report, Xi Jinping highlights how China has practised "true
multilateralism \[...\] taken a clear-cut stance against hegemonism and
power politics". He then links multilateralism with the endorsement of
global governance: "China plays an active part in the reform and
development of the global governance system. It pursues a vision of
global governance featuring shared growth through discussion and
collaboration. China upholds true multilateralism, promotes greater
democracy in international relations, and works to make global
governance fairer and more equitable."14) But how is this relevant to
the Arctic? China has long strived to gain observer status within the
Arctic Council. The global approach to Arctic geopolitics is deeply
rooted in the global repercussions of climate change-induced phenomena
happening in the Arctic. Since the 2000s, China has been improving its
influence on international trade, finance and development institutions,
and it also took part in international environmental
treaties.15) Dynamicity in the commerce and finance fields is shown
through the Silk Road Fund, the Belt and Road Initiative, the Free trade
area of Asia Pacific Framework and the Asia Infrastructure Investment
Bank (AIIB). The ratification of the Agreement banning illegal fishing
in the Central Arctic Ocean in May 2021 and the endorsement of UNCLOS as
the primary legal instrument for maritime disputes in the Arctic
reinforced China's position as a supporter of the rule of law in
international politics.

**[China's global perspective of the Arctic and the [endorsement of the
legal framework]{.mark} are timely and in line with the shifting of the
Arctic from a region with its own agenda to a region with tightened
connections to a broader planetary system]{.underline}**.16) Chinese
rhetoric of endorsing multilateralism and a cooperative approach should
not be **[underestimated. China finds itself as a legit actor in the
Arctic Council]{.underline}**, and, through the words of its special
envoy Gao Feng shares skepticism about a smooth passage of the Council's
chairmanship to Norway.17)

China's position regarding the unilateral decision to halt the work of
the Arctic Council is profoundly anchored to the Arctic Council's
mandate, which does not include security matters. It is also supported
by the concept of non-intervention in domestic issues. While China's
position stands for softening the hostilities with Russia, from the
Arctic-7 perspective, especially from the US, it might further
stigmatize China's role in the Arctic. In the short term, as for the
concept of a community with a shared future, multilateralism advocated
in the Congress Report must face the new reality influenced by the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In the long-term, despite Gao Feng's
skepticism, the State Secretary Eivind Vad Petersson in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs does not share any doubt about a placid takeover of
Norway of the Arctic Council's chairmanship in May 2023.18) This spring,
we expect a new boost in reestablishing the work of the Arctic Council,
where the Arctic-7 might work on lowering the tension and shifting the
focus on climate change. In this context, China might keep adopting its
pragmatic approach to foreign policy, on one side maintaining economic
and energy cooperation with Russia and jointly working on the
development of the Polar Silk Road, on the other, striving to keep
participating in Arctic Council work, which is the leading way to be
involved in Arctic issues. What we have already learned is that the
Arctic, rather than being a region for explicit military confrontation,
is a region that mirrors the evolution of geopolitical situations
happening elsewhere and where probably the governance is not appropriate
to handle moments of growing tension. However, even though a
normalization of the conflict in Ukraine is unlikely in the following
months, climate change will be again at the center of international
cooperation and multilateralism, and joint efforts are the only way to
help mitigate its effects. Conclusion The 20th Congress of the CCP was
historical in approving norm-breaking decisions. It confirmed and
reinforced Xi Jinping's leadership. While new priorities, such as
national and international security, have been set over the economic
development, no significant change will be adopted concerning the Arctic
strategy.

**[The [interconnectedness]{.mark} between producing sound scientific
knowledge [with the Arctic governance structure]{.mark}, and [China's
penchant for proposing]{.mark} [multilateral projects oriented to
generate shared economic benefits, induce China to consider
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** as an element of continuity **[[in
the region]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Gao Feng's statement in the Arctic
Circle assembly resonates with China's attempt to avoid a severe
destabilization of the Arctic relations between Russia and the Arctic-7.

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though 1,400 kilometers south of the
Arctic Circle, has rarely let such mere details impede its ambitions. In
2018, it **[[declared itself a "near-Arctic state]{.mark}" [and
announced plans to become a "polar great power" by
2030]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That goal was **[[reaffirmed three years

Plan]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} which **[pledged]{.underline}**
"practical cooperation in the Arctic" and the development of **[[the
"Silk Road on Ice."]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

The yet-to-be-released **[15th Five-Year Plan]{.underline}** (2026-2030)
is **[expected to extend these efforts, with particular [emphasis
on]{.mark} what Beijing calls the ["ice and snow
economy]{.mark}"]{.underline}** -- a broad term that encompasses
everything from scientific research, maritime access and more
strikingly, tourism and culture. This last point is particularly
revealing. 

While it is easy to view China's Arctic ambitions as purely strategic,
for **[President Xi Jinping [culture is inseparable from
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[His [vision is]{.mark} not merely one
of territory or trade; but [of civilization.]{.mark} For Beijing, the
[Arctic is a canvas for the projection of Chinese esthetics, history and
ideology]{.mark} -- part of the CCP's w[ider efforts to frame a new
world order with its narrative center stage.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Beijing's Arctic infrastructure]{.underline}**

The **[CCP's]{.underline}** 2018 **[Arctic policy white
paper]{.underline}**, which put forward China's contested claim to
"near-Arctic" status, also **[insisted that [developments in the region
have a "vital bearing" on the]{.mark} [country's national
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} At the time, those interests
were framed largely in terms of environmental protection and scientific
research -- pretexts that have since facilitated Beijing's Arctic
presence. Through its Yellow River research station in Norway's Svalbard
archipelago and the China-Iceland Arctic Research Observatory, for
example, **[Beijing has conducted studies in marine ecology, space
physics and glacier dynamics. ]{.underline}**

Officially, the aim is to ensure "the sustainability of environmental
protection, resource utilization, and human activities." **[Yet, its
[research missions often entail]{.mark} oceanographic surveys and
acoustic modeling, [mirroring CCP operations in the]{.mark}
[S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea where [mapping underwater
terrain has played a critical role in]{.mark} the [P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy's (PLA) [strategic
positioning]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Since 2018, China's polar programs have been overseen primarily by the
Ministry of Natural Resources, the same body responsible for its
research in the South China Sea. The overlap between Arctic science and
the PLA is hardly incidental. It reflects the doctrine of military-civil
fusion, the principle that Chinese civilian and commercial sectors must
serve the CCP's national security objectives. Military-civil fusion is
not new -- its first iterations were developed under Mao Zedong -- yet
under President Xi, it has been elevated as a core pillar of state
strategy. The 2020 edition of Science of Military Strategy, the PLA's
central doctrinal publication, makes this connection explicit in China's
Arctic affairs: "Military-civilian mixing is the main way for great
powers to achieve a polar presence," it states, urging China to "give
full play to the role of military forces in supporting polar scientific
research." China's Arctic ambitions have accelerated markedly since
2022, propelled in no small part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The
resulting Western sanctions have curtailed Moscow's access to foreign
satellite imagery, for instance, and other technologies critical to
Arctic navigation, forcing Moscow into a growing -- if wary -- reliance
on Beijing. This shift is reflected in Russia's revised 2023 Arctic
policy, which abandoned its prior emphasis on multilateral cooperation
within the Arctic Council in favor of "relations with foreign states on
a bilateral basis." Yet it would be a mistake to attribute China's
buoyancy in the region merely to Russian misfortunes. Beijing has been
steadily entrenching itself in the Arctic through membership in
organizations like the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific
Association, which operates Arctic radar systems with both scientific
and defense applications, as well as through targeted investments in key
dual-use infrastructure across the European Arctic. Much of this
development is concentrated in Norway, Sweden, Finland and especially
Russia, where Chinese firms have been involved in the construction of
bridges, railways, subway and commuter train systems, and energy-related
infrastructure. A significant portion of this activity is focused along
the Northern Sea Route (NSR), the Arctic passage that threads through
Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone from the Baltic to the Bering Sea,
where melting ice is steadily extending the window of the NSR's maritime
navigability. Already, a trip from Dalian in China to Rotterdam in the
Netherlands via the NSR takes 33 days, compared to 48 through the Suez
Canal. But for Beijing, the appeal of the NSR extends beyond logistics.
The corridor provides an alternative route to the Suez, the South China
Sea and critically, the Strait of Malacca -- a passage so strategically
fraught that former president Hu Jintao dubbed China's dependence on it
the "Malacca dilemma." Beijing's investments along the NSR reflect this
strategic calculus. It has committed \$300 million to a coal terminal in
Murmansk and signed on to develop a deepwater port at Arkhangelsk, on
the White Sea. Through loans from the China Development Bank and the
Export-Import Bank of China, it has financed up to 60 percent of
Russia's Yamal liquefied natural gas project, the "crown jewel" of
Moscow's Arctic ambitions. The project terminates in the port city of
Sabetta, where Chinese firms have built not only the port itself but
also Sabetta International Airport and the Bovanenkovo-Sabetta railway,
which links western Siberia to the Arctic coast. In the former, the
China Communications Company has partnered with Russian Titanium
Resources to develop a vast titanium deposit. This project also includes
the construction of a railway linking Sosnogorsk to Indiga on the
Barents Sea and the expansion of Indiga's deepwater port. Outside of
Russia, China does not own any ports in the European or North American
Arctic, yet its influence is manifest via other means. Hutchison Ports,
a Hong Kong-based company, operates the container terminal at Stockholm
Norvik Port, a vital node in the region's logistics network. In 2023,
the ports of Gothenburg and Shenzhen formalized a sister port agreement,
ostensibly focused on sustainable transport and increased trade volumes,
though such agreements often serve broader strategic aims. China's
presence also extends to critical infrastructure. In Sweden, China
Railways Group, via its subsidiary China Railway Tunnel Group, is
engaged in the construction of tunnels for the extension of Stockholm's
metro. Until 2024, MTR Corporation, also based in Hong Kong, operated
parts of the city's subway and commuter trains. In Norway, the Sichuan
Road & Bridge Group constructed the Halogaland and Beitstad bridges,
completed in 2018 and 2022, respectively. Meanwhile in Finland, the
China Investment Corporation has been managing more than 1 million
square meters of logistics property since 2017, including facilities in
Helsinki's IA Vuosaari harbor area, Kouvola's railway logistics centers,
and the logistics and warehouse space at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.
Infrastructure as culture

**[[Infrastructure is a language of power]{.mark}, a [means of reshaping
global influence]{.mark} through concrete and steel.]{.underline}**
China's push into port infrastructure, for example, is part of its
**[[wider ambition to become a "great maritime power" by
2035]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a goal pursued with strategic patience and
intent. In 2017, the PLA Navy (PLAN) entered the Baltic Sea for the
first time, collaborating with Russian forces for joint exercises. Last
August, a four-vessel flotilla from both nations conducted its
first-ever patrol above the Arctic Circle, passing through the Bering
and Chukchi Seas near Alaska.

Officially, the PLAN has yet to dock at any of Beijing's European port
holdings. Unofficially, precedent suggests it is only a matter of time.
Across parts of Africa and Latin America, for example, commercial ports
already serve PLAN warships for maintenance and refueling. There is
little reason to believe the Arctic will be an exception.

**[[Infrastructure is symbol, culture, projection]{.mark} -- for
Beijing, perhaps, all three.]{.underline}** Consider China's flagship
icebreaker, Xue Long 2 ("Snow Dragon 2"), which launched in 2019 and
participated in the flotilla that navigated the Arctic Circle last year.
In Chinese tradition, both [**[snow and dragons are laden with
meaning]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Snow is often depicted as a mystical and
cleansing force -- one of purity and renewal. In ancient texts such as
the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) and Book of Rites (Li Ji),
and even in Tang Dynasty poetry, snow is portrayed as both harsh,
evoking the bleakness of winter, and hopeful, carrying the promise of
spring's renewal. Or, in the present context, **[promises of China's
expanding [influence in the Arctic,]{.mark} with [the CCP's hopes for a
new geopolitical era.]{.mark}]{.underline}** 

The dragon, too, is emblematic of power and authority. Throughout
China's imperial history, it marked the emperor's divine right to rule.
The seal of Emperor Taizong of Tang (598-649 CE), for example, bore the
inscription Longzhong ("Among Dragons"), signifying his status as the
"Son of Heaven." In the Qing Dynasty, too, the imperial throne was known
as the "Dragon Throne." In naming its premier icebreaker Snow Dragon,
then, Beijing's message is hardly subtle. More broadly, the cultural
allusions embedded in the naming of its strategic assets and
geopolitical ventures -- such as the "Silk Road on Ice," Beijing's
preferred term for the "Polar Silk Road" -- are neither incidental nor
merely nostalgic. Names shape identity; they influence how nations
perceive and relate to one another and in China's case, serve to
cultivate a sense of familiarity -- even inevitability.

The invocation of the "Silk Road," for instance, frames China's Arctic
aims not as an expansion into unfamiliar terrain but as the logical
extension of a historical enterprise. The implication is that
**[[China's expanding regional presence is]{.mark} not an aberration but
the latest chapter in a [centuries-old saga.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

For President Xi, such narratives are instruments of power. Since 2017,
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of "telling China's story
well," a phrase that, in Beijing's lexicon, has less to do with national
image than national destiny. Shaping the global discourse is integral to
the CCP's aim of China's so-called national rejuvenation and ultimately,
the creation of a "global community of shared future," in which the
Party's Marxist-Maoist ideology is to be positioned as a viable
alternative to the Western-led order. Infrastructure design is an
integral part of this endeavor. Beyond its utilitarian function, the
built environment is a vehicle for China's ideological and cultural
messaging. Design, after all, is the most direct means of shaping spaces
and the meanings attributed to them.Bridges, for instance --
particularly those with iconic status -- are more than mere connectors
of places. They shape place identity, such as in San Francisco or
London. German philosopher Martin Heidegger, in reflecting on the nature
of architecture, went so far as to argue that bridges do not merely
occupy locations but, in fact, bring them into being. The CCP appears to
share this view. State media outlets have described the Halogaland
Bridge as "Norway's new landmark and business card," attributing
regional development to its construction and citing local voices that
speak of a "special relationship" with the structure itself.
Infrastructure, in this sense, cultivates belonging. Similar
attributions have been made by Beijing to Chinese-built airports,
railways and subways in the European Arctic, often underscoring the
distinctly Chinese design, style and motifs embedded into these
projects. Consider, for instance, the China-Iceland Arctic Research
Observatory, where the tiered structure and central vertical axis have
been noted for their subtle nod to Chinese pagodas -- symbols of harmony
and spiritual ascent in Chinese tradition -- while also integrating the
modern materials and technologies necessary to withstand the harsh
Arctic climate. At the entrance to China's Yellow River Station in
Norway, two Fu Lion sculptures stand sentinel. The name "Yellow River"
itself carries considerable weight: China's Yellow River basin is widely
regarded as the cradle of Chinese civilization, and a symbol of cultural
resilience and continuity.

Through such means, China **[is [steadily inscribing itself into the
Arctic]{.mark} landscape and its historical narrative. The message is
one of familiarity: [China belongs to the Arctic, and the Arctic to
China]{.mark}. It is a quiet process, woven into
infrastructure]{.underline}** that appears purely functional at first
glance, in architectural design, in names that shift the contours of
memory and even details as seemingly inconsequential as Fu Lions. It is
also slow, unfolding with the deliberate patience that defines Beijing's
strategic approach. 

This process is hardly confined to the Arctic; Beijing pursues similar
tactics globally. Yet it is worth considering here, where its ambitions
are typically framed in terms of military strategy and energy security.
They are, of course, those things as well. But those are not ends in
themselves.. They serves Beijing's wider aim of a "rejuvenated" China,
not merely dominant but prescriptive, one able to shape global norms and
order in its image.

Scenarios

Likely: **[China expands its Arctic footprint]{.underline}**

**[China has [elevated the Arctic as among its primary geopolitical
priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and its expanding presence in the
region -- through maritime routes and critical infrastructure projects
-- looks set to intensify. These efforts transcend mere strategic aims;
they embed China into the Arctic environment and, over time, are likely
to influence how the region is publicly represented and to whom it is
perceived as belonging.

**[This [aspect of China's engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
whether **[in the Arctic]{.underline}** or beyond, is often dismissed as
incidental, a secondary concern to its broader strategic ambitions. Yet,
in many respects, it is central to Beijing's global approach. Precisely
because it is overlooked, however, Beijing has been able to increasingly
imprint itself onto landscapes and histories far from its own. In
Stockholm, for instance, where Beijing is involved in the construction
of new metro lines, Chinese artwork may soon adorn the station walls --
another quiet claim of identity and ownership. The subway itself is an
interesting construct, often a reflection of urban identity and at times
linked, in psychological terms, to a kind of collective subconscious. To
shape such a space, even indirectly, is to shape how a city sees itself.
**[Should Beijing have its way, that [image will increasingly be
intertwined with Chinese values and identity, as dictated by the
CCP.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Also likely: Beijing succeeds at changing the global discourse around
China

Little can be done about how China names its projects and strategic
assets; it is, of course, free to do as it likes in this regard. Yet the
design elements of Beijing's infrastructure projects in the Arctic, as
well as its activities more broadly, merit closer scrutiny. Otherwise,
**[China]{.underline}** might not only resolve its "Malacca dilemma,"
**[carving out a path toward becoming a "[polar great power]{.mark}" and
a dominant maritime force, but it might [also refashion identity and
histor]{.mark}y]{.underline}** -- not just of the Arctic, but of the
entire world. Infrastructure, after all, is rarely just infrastructure.

#### China's Arctic presence is key to its overall soft power, but U.S. expansion disrupts it.

[The relevance of these perspectives for [Arctic small states in]{.mark}
the [context of Chinese engagement]{.mark} in the opening of the NSR [is
**clear**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Clingendael in its Presence Before Power
(2020) has articulated many of the factors. [[China]{.mark} has been

[[aspect of]{.mark} "an **[explicit geopolitical purpose]{.mark}**

expansion]{.mark}, maritime ambitions [and]{.mark} its [**changing

2020) for more than two decades. Quietly [[engaging]{.mark} and building
partnership [with]{.mark} small states in research and trade,
particularly with [Iceland, Greenland, and Finland]{.mark}, it is
already present]{.underline}. As regard US strategic interest in
Greenland, Trump suggested to his advisors in 2018 that the solution
might be for the United States to purchase Greenland from Denmark. This
might not have been as outlandish an idea as it appears as in the
nineteenth and early twentieth century the United States, having had a
strong claim on at least part of Greenland, had suggested the same.
China has further [projected its intensions for greater engagement in
Iceland by building a large embassy, even if only 5 diplomats were
accredited in 2020]{.underline}... what Clingendael (2020) suggests
might be a Potemkin presence; creating an illusion of interest to draw
attention from other intensions. [[China]{.mark} is **interested** and
will, at minimum, [exploit]{.mark} the [benefits of]{.mark} the [new NSR
as a]{.mark} trade [corridor and source of energy]{.mark}.]{.underline}
It is already engaged here with Russia in purchasing huge amounts of
natural gas and LNG from the Yamal fields, with long-term contracts and
shared investment. At least until early 2022, [most [Arctic small
states]{.mark} have been [**comfortable** to deal with China]{.mark}
while operating within the context of a rulesbased order]{.underline}.
These states are [generally liberal democracies with solid development
and identity legitimacy and pluralisation of governance, (Lampard et
al., 2020), so [they have]{.mark} the [capacity to be
**receptive**]{.mark} and also to frequently recalibrate their
engagement [with China]{.mark} regarding infrastructural
inducement]{.underline}. On the other hand, despite recent sound policy
guidance regarding the importance of engagement in the Arctic,
specifically from the Wilson Centre's Polar Institute in Navigating the
Arctics 7 Cs, (2021[) [US is behind the curve in the Arc]{.mark}tic and
playing "**catch-up**". Globally, in a polarised international
environment, [US' future **influence** is **in
doubt**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Currently at political war internally in a
broad crisis of confidence in the political system, seen by many in
Europe as the lunatics versus the terrified, it has, up to [[recently
**dropped** ]{.mark}**the [ball]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} effective
[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy and its relationship with both Russia
and China]{.underline}; particularly so as regards naval power
projection in the Arctic. It may now, in light of the deteriorating
relations with both Russia and China, be seeing a strengthening NATO and
pick up that dropped ball. In 2011 it deactivated the 2nd Fleet covering
the East Coast of US and the North Atlantic. However, in light of the
emerging Sino-Russian collaboration and China's increasing presence in
the Arctic, it reactivated the 2nd Fleet in 2018. Still,
[[recovery]{.mark} will not be easy and "**catch-up**" **[will take
time]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Concurrently, in the second half of 2023 we
see the efforts of the current Democratic administration under Joe
Biden, notably in his speech to the opening of the 78th UN Generally
Assembly in September 2023, reach out, toning down talk of "de-coupling"
to a less confrontational "derisking," in an attempt to reduce tensions
with China. These tensions rising from the great power competition
globally, also point to concerns regarding the emergence of a bipolar
order in the Arctic, what Bertelsen (2022, pp. 478 and 479) refers to
the [[division of]{.mark} the "[Arctic into a]{.mark} US and Chinese
bounded order with the [Nordic and North]{.mark} [American
Arctic]{.mark} within the [US]{.mark} bounded [order and]{.mark} the
[Russian]{.mark} Arctic in the [Chinese]{.mark} bounded [order]{.mark}."
Small [Arctic states]{.mark}, as a result of the focus on the NSR, are
now [drawn]{.mark} from the global periphery [into]{.mark} the **[centre
of]{.mark} attention** and are **[gaining leverage]{.mark}**. Initially,
they considered how they could capitalise on the growth of the NSR
through trade, passing trade and entrepot/servicing facilities in the
context of a rules-based order under the Arctic Council]{.underline}.
Now, with the Council "paused", the environment is unpredictable and
security considerations come to the fore. Ships of the Chinese fleet are
already undertaking Freedom of Navigation sorties in Arctic waters in
collaboration with the Russian Navy, notably in the Bering Sea adjacent
to Alaska, replicating the justification for Western Freedom of
Navigation sorties in the South China Sea. How soon before Chinese
Aircraft Carrier groups, probably in collaboration with Russian naval
resources, are transiting the Bering Straits into the Central Arctic
Ocean and on to the North Atlantic, just as the US carrier groups roam
the seven seas? NATO may now have woken up.

On February 17, the Chinese animated film "Ne Zha 2" took its place
among the top 10 highest-grossing [films]{.underline} of all time, with
its global box office haul at \$1.66 billion and climbing. This
milestone followed the global success of the video [game]{.underline}
"Black Myth: Wukong." Both are [emblematic of [China's accelerating
cultural exports and **expanding** **soft power**]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

[[Domestically, such successes resonate deeply within a **society**
undergoing a **state-driven** cultural
**rejuvenation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, cultivating a strong
culture-centric nationalism. By strategically [aligning soft power
**expansion** with this revival of traditional **culture**]{.underline},
the Chinese government leverages [symbolic achievements to enhance its
**domestic** **political legitimacy**]{.underline}. As China continues
to integrate culture into its global strategy, this interplay between
external recognition and internal legitimacy will remain central to its
pursuit of soft power.

Cultivating a Cultural Rejuvenation at Home

Despite the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s historical campaigns against
traditional culture, [Xi [Jinping's leadership has placed **culture**
at the core of China's **great rejuvenation plan**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Xi actively embraces Chinese traditional culture, reframing the
preservation and development of excellent traditional culture as the
party's mission. 

This shift is evident in the CCP's evolving ideological framework. On
July 1, 2016, during the 95th anniversary celebration of the party's
founding, Xi notably added "Confidence in Culture" to the established
"Three Confidences" introduced at the 18th Party Congress, thus
formulating the "Four Confidences." [This marked an [explicit elevation
of **cultural identity** within the **CCP's legitimacy
discourse**]{.mark}, blurring the boundary of culture and
ideology]{.underline}. 

More recently, Xi's Thought on Culture was formally introduced during
the National Conference on Propaganda, Ideological and Cultural Work in
October 2023. While the ideological foundation remains deeply rooted in
party doctrine, its [practical implementation has increasingly
emphasized the revival and [**promotion** of traditional **Chinese**
**culture**]{.mark} over communist ideological narratives]{.underline}.
Underscoring the role of traditional culture in Chinese-style
modernization, Beijing suggests that this legacy should be reinvigorated
to fuel contemporary national development. 

Within this framework, a surge in cultural enthusiasm has become evident
across Chinese society. One example is the popularity of Han
clothing (hanfu), particularly among the younger generation. In 2023,
the number of registered Han clothing-related enterprises in China
increased by 355.25 percent year-on-year, with the market size exceeding
14.4 billion yuan. The Chinese Hanfu market is expected to continue to
grow, reaching a predicted 24.28 billion yuan by 2027. 

This cultural resurgence also [reinforces
a **culture-centric nationalism**, where pride in Chinese heritage
increasingly defines national identity]{.underline}. For instance, many
Chinese take great pride in seeing foreigners wearing traditional
Chinese attire, such as the Mamian skirt, or participating in cultural
festivities. While foreign appreciation of Chinese traditions is
celebrated, reverse cultural exchanges -- such as Chinese individuals
wearing Japanese kimonos -- often provoke nationalist backlash.
Similarly, while international adoption of Chinese holidays is welcomed,
the domestic celebration of Western festivals like Christmas frequently
sparks criticism, with some schools and local governments discouraging
or even banning such observances.

The social media landscape further amplifies these dynamics. Trending
videos of foreigners eating Chinese cuisine or traveling across China
generate significant online traffic in China, reinforcing the narrative
of Chinese culture's global appeal. These trends illustrate how cultural
nationalism is not merely state-imposed but also reinforced by popular
sentiment, shaping both domestic identity and China's outward projection
of soft power.

Expanding Culture Influence Abroad to Build a Great Power Image at Home

[Against the backdrop, China has been [**actively expanding** its
cultural influence]{.mark} abroad through two key tactics: [**deepening
engagement** with international **institutions**]{.mark} and promoting
the **global export** of cultural products]{.underline}. These efforts
are not only aimed at enhancing China's soft power on the world stage
but also at reinforcing its great power image domestically.

The increasing interaction with international institutions particularly
materialized through heritage diplomacy and holding international
conferences. By becoming the largest contributor to UNESCO, China has
systematically elevated its civilizational stature. As of 2024, China
has 44 items on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List and 57
UNESCO World Heritage sites, making it the first and second most
enlisted country in the world. Domestic media often portrayed China's
leading role in heritage conservation, linking international recognition
to domestic cultural pride. U.N. recognition of Chinese culture --
UNESCO's 2024 recognition of the Chinese New Year, for instance -- is
celebrated not only as a contribution to world cultural heritage but
also as a diplomatic victory.

Concurrently, [China has institutionalized its influence through
platforms such as the **[B]{.mark}**eijing **[C]{.mark}**ulture
**[F]{.mark}**orum, the **[Nishan Forum]{.mark}** on World Civilization,
and other multilateral forums, promoting "cultural
connectivity"]{.underline} under its leadership. Additionally, in 2023,
Xi introduced the Global Civilization Initiative, aiming to showcase
China's capability to provide public goods to the international
community. 

The second strategy revolves around the [global export of Chinese
cultural products, attempting to merge market success with ideological
validation. The [success of **films**]{.mark} such as "Ne Zha" and "The
Wandering Earth"]{.underline} highlights [China's growing ability to
shape **global entertainment markets**]{.underline}. In the gaming
industry, "Genshin Impact" and "Black Myth: Wukong" have gained massive
international followings, bringing Chinese mythology and aesthetics to a
global audience. 

The 2024 Report on the Chinese Cultural Symbols International
Communication Index (CSIC) pointed out that traditional culture is
experiencing a resurgence among China's exported cultural products.
These commercial achievements are leveraged domestically as proof that
China's cultural industries are no longer confined to national borders
but are actively influencing global cultural trends. 

More importantly, the export of cultural products also has an economic
motivation. [The development of China's cultural industry is also
driving the development of related industries, such as cultural tourism,
catering, and film and television.]{.underline} This becomes critical
for China against the domestic backdrop of an economic slowdown and a
pivot toward the so-called "new productive forces." 

Conclusion

However, while these [cultural exports enhance China's international
image, their **greatest impact** is within China itself. [The **CCP**
strategically presents these successes as **validation** of China's
**civilizational strength**, reinforcing domestic **nationalism** and
**consolidating** its **legitimacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The more
China's cultural products are embraced abroad, the stronger the
perception that China's influence is expanding. Through these efforts,
China's cultural diplomacy serves a dual purpose: strengthening its
international image while simultaneously deepening domestic confidence
in its role as a great power. As China continues to integrate culture
into its global strategy, this interplay between external recognition
and internal legitimacy will remain central to its pursuit of soft
power.

#### [Psychology]{.underline} proves soft power is key towards [belief preservation]{.underline} of Chinese [citizens]{.underline}

wall through the case of the Confucius Institute\", *Humanities and

Soft power and its understanding in China. In 1990, Joseph Nye
challenged the prevailing belief that US strength was waning by
introducing the concept of soft power (Nye 1990a; Ohnesorge, 2020a). In
international politics, as opposed to hard power--- which focuses on
coercive actions to enforce national interests (Art, 1996; Wilson, 2008,
p. 114)---**[[soft powe]{.mark}r is the ability to obtain preferred
outcomes by persuasion and attraction]{.underline}** (Nye 2017, p. 1).
It is shown in political, moral, or cultural influence, and is less
resource-intensive and more manageable in case of failure (Bilgin and
Elis 2008; Chen 2022; Eliküçük et al. 2020; Wilson 2008). Nye (2017, p.
2) emphasizes that soft power should originate from civil society rather
than governments, since it mainly targets individuals, grassroots
communities, and populations.

Contrary to Nye's interpretation, Wang **[Huning's ["Chinese styled
version" of soft power focuses on culture]{.mark} as the primary driver
and is [considered a nation-led policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Duarte
and FerreiraPereira 2022; Glaser and Murphy 2009, pp. 110-111). Soft
Power has gradually played a vital role in China's aim of "peaceful
rise." **[Since Hu Jintao's era, the [CCP has promoted soft
power]{.mark} as a national strategy]{.underline}** (Edney 2015). **[[Xi
Jinping's era has been framed perception]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Raftopoulos et al. 2015; Stokes 2013). **[This dual processing model
highlights]{.underline}** the role of prior knowledge in shaping
perception, which is particularly relevant to **[how [individuals
interpret]{.mark} ideologically charged constructs, such as [soft
power.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As a non-coercive strategy, **[soft power imperceptibly affects
individuals because our minds adopt knowledge structures that embed
intangible values and equitie]{.underline}**s (Kamali 2020. 11; Thomson
2020; Keller and Brexendorf 2017). In this case, Nye and Wang hold
contrary interpretations of soft power orientations and mechanisms.
**[People's [internal knowledge structures play a significant]{.mark}
[role]{.mark} in recognizing the external world through their subjective
perception, and individuals naturally posit a preferentially endorsed
viewpoint]{.underline}**. Non-Chinese citizens, educated and immersed in
Nye's soft power theory, subtly perceived soft power as being led by
society. Conversely, **[[individuals from mainland China tend to
perceive soft power]{.mark} as a domain that should be [guided by the
state]{.mark}, as the [CCP has systematically fostered a sociocultural
environment]{.mark} wherein [cultural production is regulated by the
government]{.mark}, and the promotion of cultural confidence is
emphasized]{.underline}**. At the theoretical level, under the different
concepts of soft power**[, individuals bring themselves to a mental
model conflict and create a sociocognitive barrier]{.underline}**.
Aligned with Johnson-Laird (1983), internal cognitive frameworks are
formed through individual experiences that enable the interpretation and
prediction of world phenomena. When novel information challenges
entrenched mental models (JohnsonLaird 1983), cognitive systems initiate
defense protocols characterized by selective assimilation (Held 2006)
and conceptual recalibration (Hemforth and Konieczny, 2006). This
selfpreservation mechanism manifests itself through either active
rejection (discarding dissonant data via attentional filtering) or
passive distortion (reinterpreting inputs through existing schemata),
effectively constructing epistemic buffers against paradigm shifts
(Kahneman 2011). Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. Such
**[[cognitive immunization processes]{.mark}---when applied to
[divergent conceptualizations of soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(state-centric vs. society-oriented frameworks)---create fault lines in
individual cognition, **[[ultimately solidifying into a cognitive
wall]{.mark} and emerging as [neural substrates of belief
perseverance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This means that the **[[cognition
wall is a habitual]{.mark} or [entrenched belief rooted in one's mental
image]{.mark} that [prevents clear thinking]{.mark} and hinders
understanding]{.underline}** (Maiese and Hanna, 2019). In general,
beliefs and thoughts influence what we see, which is related to human
cognitive penetrability (Raftopoulos et al. 2015; Stokes 2013). As part
of the cognitive wall, cognitive penetrability occurs when humans
systematically manipulate knowledge and beliefs to alter empirical
phenomena (Raftopoulos 2019). For instance, Siegel's (2013) "Angry Jack"
cognitive model illustrates how the protagonist Jill's preexisting
belief that Jack harbors animosity toward her fosters persistent
suspicion. This distortion of cognition endures, even when confronted
with contradictory behavioral evidence, **[highlighting the power of
deeply ingrained mental schemas in [shaping perception over
external]{.mark} reality]{.underline}**. Simply put, in the cognitive
penetrability of human perception, people's **[internal knowledge
structures play a significant role in recognizing the external world and
perceiving]{.underline}** the world with their subjective perception,
**[[rather than correctly understanding the world's
facts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this case, the penetrability of
**[[perception causes humans to view one of the soft power mechanisms as
a credible theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, resulting in varied reactions
to cultural promotion programs.

Another cognition wall perspective is the confirmation bias. As the
tendency of people to favor information that confirms their existing
beliefs or hypotheses, confirmation bias occurs when an analyst
knowingly or unknowingly seeks information that supports their beliefs
and hypotheses (Koen and Bowers 2017, 2018; Nickerson 1998). Individuals
displaying this bias are more prone to seek and assign more weight to
information, thus confirming their perceptions (Klayman 1995; Oswald and
Grosjean 2004). People react protectively if newly discovered knowledge
contradicts their knowledge structure (Lack and Rousseau 2022). This
bias may increase the gap in contradictory information by reinforcing
individual's pre-existing beliefs (Lord et al. 1979). Thus, owing to the
contrasting foundations of China's government-led soft power and Nye's
society-driven model, individuals are likely to perceive soft power in
different ways.

Different soft power models lead to varied perceptions. Cognitive
penetrability shapes how knowledge structures are formed, making one
model of soft power appear to be more persuasive. Confirmation bias
further reinforces these perceptions as individuals tend to defend and
rationalize the soft power framework advanced by either Nye or Wang.
This contributes to the formation of a cognition wall that divides
audiences into distinct interpretive camps regarding the source and
orientation of soft power. **[Individuals]{.underline}** are more likely
to **[respond positively to [cultural promotion programs that align with
the soft power model]{.mark} they are [predisposed to
accept]{.mark},]{.underline}** whether **[[rooted in China's state-led
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** or Nye's society-based theory

Similar to the previous transition from revolutionary charisma to
economy prosperity, the **[[shift]{.mark} in political legitimacy to
national populism [unfolded over many
years]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The transition began under Hu,
who recognized the limits of economic prosperity--based legitimacy and
instead proposed a more scientific form of development that emphasized
governance and the provision of a broader array of social welfare goods,
including higher incomes, education, health, retirement, and other
benefits.1 Hu also promoted patriotic pride through the national defense
education initiatives and through propaganda for major events, such as
the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.2 To improve the party's capacity
for governance, Hu directed a major effort to professionalize the cadre
corps through revamped recruitment and promotion standards and extensive
training and education.3

Under Hu, the PLA mirrored the transition to national populism by
expanding its focus to **[include a set of [New Historic
Missions]{.mark} to carry out a broad range of non war
missions]{.underline}** and to strengthen its capacity for combat
operations.4 The PLA played an **[[important role in fostering national
pride]{.underline}]{.mark}** through parades, high-profile exercises,
the fielding of prestigious platforms, such as the aircraft carrier
Liaoning, and **[[deployments abroad]{.mark} that [bolstered China's
image]{.mark}]{.underline}** and aided endangered citizens. These
activities included a PLA-led noncombatant evacuation from Libya in
2011, extensive goodwill cruises and port calls, increases in United
Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations, and the deployment of
counterpiracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden beginning in late 2008.5

Yet, throughout Hu's tenure, the old focus on promoting rapid economic
growth persisted. Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged
over 10 percent from 2002 to 2012, which was powered largely by
unsustainable debt-driven investment.6 Rising wages, beginning around
the early 2000s, rendered an economic strategy based on low-cost labor
unsustainable.7 To maintain high growth rates, the country piled on debt
and wasted resources through unnecessary construction and the
maintenance of an inefficient state sector.8 The compounding effects of
debt, low productivity, and demographic aging raised the risk of
long-term economic stagnation.9 Hu also failed to resolve legacy costs
of the rapid-growth policies, including worsening inequality, severe
pollution, an underdeveloped social safety net, and rampant
corruption.10 Mass protests surged. To control discontent, China's
internal security budget ballooned and has exceeded the defense budget
since 2011.11 Hu's inability to ensure effective governance, control
corruption, and place the economy on a sustainable footing has earned
him considerable criticism. Many Chinese lament this so-called lost
decade, in which the government failed to overcome structural
imbalances.12 The PLA also reflected the paradox of an incomplete shift
toward a new basis of legitimacy. On the one hand, the military expanded
its international presence and competently executed a variety of nonwar
missions, including counterpiracy patrols, noncombatant evacuations, and
international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The PLA also
acquired modern platforms and improved the overall competence and
professional caliber of its personnel.13 The military also overhauled
its approach to recruitment, training, and education to improve the
professional competence of its force.14 Yet, on the other hand, the old
bias toward self-enrichment persisted, which could be seen in subsequent
revelations of out-of-control corruption.15 China's security-related
foreign policy also reflected competing ideas. The country continued to
prioritize trade and development in its dealings with other countries.
However, observers detected a subtle shift toward a more assertive
foreign policy when the government adopted a more confrontational stance
in several disputes, such as one involving the Philippines from 2009 to
2012 and in a standoff involving a Chinese fishing trawler and Japanese
maritime law enforcement around 2010.16 In sum, Hu recognized that the
party's reliance on economic growth for legitimacy was unsustainable. He
began a shift in focus toward governance as the basis of legitimacy.
This new approach entailed a technocratic vision in which the government
provided relatively generous social welfare benefits and goods to
compensate for an anticipated slowdown in income growth while the
economy decelerated. Hu also promoted patriotism to augment the turn
toward governance. To carry this out, Hu oversaw a large-scale effort to
improve the quality and competence of cadres responsible for carrying
out a governance agenda. However, Hu's ambitions were checked by
inadequate resources for an ambitious governance agenda and the
persistence of corruption. The PLA could only progress a limited degree
toward becoming a combat effective force because the military remained
riven by corruption and its mission of defending national interests was
subordinate to that of ensuring stable economic growth. A new leader,
successor Xi, would need to complete the transition to a new basis of
political legitimacy. National Populism Legitimacy

**[[Xi completed the transition]{.mark} to a new basis of legitimacy,
which we call national populism]{.underline}**. This new paradigm
carried forward Hu's idea that legitimacy should be based on a blend of
improved governance and **[[national prestige to offset declines
in]{.mark} potential [econ]{.mark}omic gains]{.underline}**. However, Xi
modified this approach by reducing the set of promised goods to
individual Chinese citizens to better accord with the reality of fiscal
constraints. In particular**[, Xi's national populism
[emphasized]{.mark}]{.underline}** the government's provision of
individual security and **[[national dignity and
pride]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Xi upheld the provision of a broader array
of governance goods, including higher living standards and social
welfare benefits, but at the same time, he admitted that these needs
exceeded what the state could provide.

Xi appeared to offset the state's inadequate ability to provide public
goods by cultivating a public image as a champion of the common man who
was willing to take on corrupt elites. In doing so, Xi had the benefit
of broad CCP agreement that Xi should be a powerful leader---certainly
more powerful than Hu---to cut through the powerful interest groups that
paralyzed party decision-making and to control the rampant corruption
that arose as a result.17 These two changes brought about a more
sustainable form of political legitimacy. However, **[national populism
remains a [relatively fragile legitimacy]{.mark} because it inherently
[concedes t]{.mark}hat the [support of]{.mark} individual citizens [is
cond]{.mark}iti[o]{.mark}nal]{.underline}**; that is, China's legitimacy
is based on the government's ability to ensure the safety and security
of Chinese citizens. **[The [anti-elite populist sentiment]{.mark} is
also [fragile]{.mark} because the [autocrat depends on elites]{.mark} to
maintain power]{.underline}** and lacks any realistic way to
significantly reverse China's destabilizing levels of inequality. These
**[conditions [constrain]{.mark} the [gov]{.mark}ernment's [options for
foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** and set **[hard limits on the
government's tolerance for escalation]{.underline}** and risk in
confrontations over the nation's interests.

Two weeks after his appointment as general secretary in November 2012,
**[Xi gave a speech at an exhibit titled the "[Road to
Revolution]{.mark},"]{.underline}** in which **[he [introduced]{.mark}
the [political slogan of]{.mark} the "[Chinese
Dream]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Xi exhorted, "Everyone is talking about
the Chinese Dream," and then cautioned, "History tells us that **[the
[future and destiny of each individual]{.mark} is closely [linked
to]{.mark} the future and [destiny of the country]{.mark} and of the
nation.]{.underline}** Only when the country is good and the nation is
good will everyone be good."18 **[Xi again unified the interests of
country, nation, and people]{.underline}** under his slogan at the
National People's Congress (NPC) in March 2013, at which **[he announced
that "to realize the [Chinese dream of]{.mark} the [great
rejuvenation]{.mark} of the Chinese nation, we must realize the
prosperity of the country, the rejuvenation of the nation, and the
happiness of the people."]{.underline}**19

Chinese state media further emphasized the populist message of the
Chinese Dream through propaganda campaigns after both speeches. Shortly
after the November 2012 Road to Revolution speech, Xinhua published an
atypically long article titled "'The People Are the Source of Our
Strength'---A Chronicle of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
General Secretary Xi Jinping," which introduced Xi to the Chinese
populace with unusual intimacy.20 The article portrayed him as a
righteous and hardworking man of the people who "uses plain language to
talk about big issues." The article also offered personal details about
Xi, such as his decades-long habit of daily phone calls with his wife
Peng Liyuan and his tradition of making New Year's dumplings.21 Xinhua
continued to reinforce Xi's "man of the people" image thereafter,
notably in an article showing Xi waiting in line to purchase steamed
buns.22 Similarly, after Xi's March 2013 NPC speech, state media
emphasized populist themes. Xinhua counted 44 mentions of "the people"
in Xi's speech and explained that "the Chinese Dream is the people's
dream, which must be realized by closely relying on the people and must
continue to benefit the people."23 The logic of these propaganda efforts
appears to be reinforcing the narrative that claims Xi is a different
kind of politician; when he calls for aligning national and personal
benefits, the Chinese people can and should trust that he has their best
interests in mind.

The government has promoted the appearance of leadership concern about
the people at the same time that it acknowledges that its ability to
actual improve the situation of citizens has declined. At the 20th Party
Congress in 2022, Xi defined the "main contradiction" that is
confronting the nation in the "new era" as the "ever growing needs of
the people for a better life" and the country's "unbalanced and
inadequate development."24 Notably, Chinese authorities have not
promised to generate the resources to overcome the gap and, instead,
opted to temper the public's expectations. **[Chinese authorities also
recognize that the party's inability to [stamp out official
corruption]{.mark} and reduce inequality have further sapped public
support]{.underline}**. Xi called **[[corruption the "greatest threat"
to CCP rule]{.mark} and [acknowledged "large disparities]{.mark}" in
income distribution as among the "many areas" in which the [government
has "fallen short]{.mark}."]{.underline}**25 Top party leaders have
frequently stressed the importance of lowering expectations and setting
feasible policy goals that are consistent with the country's finances.
For example, in a 2021 speech, Xi reportedly stressed that officials
"cannot set too high goals" and warned against spending too much on
social welfare, which might result in "raising idlers."26

[Over the past few years, and most visibly since the launch of the
**[B]{.mark}**elt and **[R]{.mark}**oad **[I]{.mark}**nitiative in 2013,
the [Chinese Party-State]{.mark} has [used every available opportunity

[manage its]{.mark} (national and [**international**) **image**]{.mark},
and to "**[gain face]{.mark}**" (要面子 yao mianzi).]{.underline} While
these [endeavors are [directed at]{.mark} different foreign and
[domestic audiences]{.mark},]{.underline} it is the latter we address
here. While COVID-19 represents a key issue for the CCP both at home and
abroad, within the Chinese political system domestic politics generally
trumps foreign policy \[37\]. Or, in other words, domestic issues,
because of their direct link to the CCP's primary objective, regime
survival, take precedence over external ones. Pu offers a convincing
argument for how the Chinese government wants to be received by
different audiences: ["[**Status signaling behaviors** face]{.mark} a
[multiple audience problem]{.mark}, and for rising powers, [the
**domestic audience** is more important]{.mark} than the international
audience"]{.underline} \[17\]. As the maintenance of domestic political
stability is paramount in ensuring the regime's continued legitimacy, it
can be expected that within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic
narratives put forth by the Chinese Party-State will take domestic
audiences as their primary addressees, as those are ultimately the
individuals on which the stability of the political system depends \[17,
37\].

Against this backdrop, the pandemic thus constituted a welcome window of
opportunity for conversing with audiences at home. This is reflected in
the employment of specific narratives directed at multiple audiences
within the country (and, as mentioned, beyond it). The following section
presents our main findings. In particular, scrutinizing media outlets'
words brought to the fore three types of CCP narratives that would be
constructed in the context of the pandemic. These are: 1) narratives
praising Chinese supremacy and effectiveness; 2) nationalistic
narratives interwoven with promises of future greatness and lessons from
past plights; and, 3) "Othering" narratives giving voice to anti-Western
sentiment. By means of structure, we first present the different types
of narratives and then subsequently discuss how they evolved or stayed
the same over the course of the pandemic. Praising Chinese Supremacy and
Effectiveness The analysis shows that performance narratives were a key
feature of the CCP's official rhetoric during all three phases of data
collection. We operationalize them as any reference made to the tangible
performance of the CCP or "China" as a whole, such as economic growth,
governance effectiveness, the sound provision of public goods, or
successful pandemic management. Interestingly, the use of performance
narratives increased over time, culminating in the third phase during
the harsh lockdown in Shanghai.4 Narratives based on economic
performance were cautionary in the first period of data collection.
Central planners seemingly tried to construct a narrative basis for the
possibility of a strong downturn in China's economic growth. They argued
that short-term economic losses would not, however, change the country's
future comprehensive rejuvenation. While these performance narratives
tried to reassure the populace that the Chinese economy was not going to
significantly slow down because of the pandemic, cautionary voices were
also raised that if it did then such an outcome would be through no
fault of the Chinese government itself. In the second phase, meanwhile,
great pride was taken in the fact that in 2020 China had been the only
"major" economy to have experienced positive growth indicators. To
compensate for the sense of insecurity around the country's economic
performance at the time, strong focus was put on the government's
pandemic prevention and control measurements, as the following statement
shows: China's eforts to coordinate pandemic control and economic growth
have convinced an increasing number of observers around the globe that
\[its\] strategy best suits its own national conditions and also
benefits the whole world.5

This can be interpreted as proving that the CCP leadership sought to
frame the Chinese economic model, a combination of central planning and
elements of a freemarket economy, as the driving force behind this
economic recovery. Nevertheless, the role of the Party-State in steering
economic development is presented as the decisive factor here, thereby
directly connecting China's strong economy in 2020 with CCP rule. As
increasing socioeconomic inequality is oftentimes interpreted as a
potential risk to the latter's continued legitimacy, especially against
the backdrop of the country's socialist history, this indicative of the
attempts made to bolster CCP legitimacy on the basis of strong economic
performance

[The [invoked narrative of China as great power]{.mark} and
international role model]{.underline} visà-vis its combating of the
pandemic would be frequently underscored by reference to the broad
praise it has received from various international organizations. Most
notable here were the World Health Organization as well as numerous
international leaders. This the following quote exemplifies: "The WHO
applauded China for its efforts in combating the epidemic\[,\] saying it
is setting a new standard for outbreak response."6

As already mentioned, performance narratives were most dominant in the
third time period examined. This can be interpreted as an attempt by the
Chinese leadership to (re)gain legitimacy amid the obvious failure of
its "zero-COVID" strategy, the renewed rise in infection rates, and the
harsh countermeasures that followed. For instance, the strict lockdown
that was imposed in Shanghai in spring 2022---as leading to widespread
complaints by local citizens regarding deteriorating living conditions,
food scarcity, and feelings of being imprisoned---was frequently framed
as "the best option"7 to combat the virus's Omicron variant. Moreover,
the lockdown was also said to help the economy---thus posited as
performing excellently in spite of the health crisis. The following
statement reveals how the dynamic-zero failures were sought to be
mitigated via claims of economic protection: \[C\]ontrary to the opinion
of some people that dynamic-zero posts a huge impact on the economy, the
measure actually protects the economy to the largest extent. According
to a preliminary analysis by mathematical-modeling experts, the impact
of a dynamic-zero strategy on local GDP is only half of the economic
impact of a nondynamic clearing strategy. Nationalistic Narratives,
Historical Myths, and Future Promises

[Both before and since the outbreak of COVID-19, the CCP [has remained
keen to **rebrand** the **Chinese nation**]{.mark} domestically as well
as internationally]{.underline}. According to Bader and Hackenesch, the
main aim here is to ["[show Chinese citizens that the CCP's **chosen
path is the right** one]{.mark}"]{.underline} \[2\]. In particular,
during the frst two examined phases, nationalistic narratives turned out
to dominate the ofcial COVID-19 discourse.

[Chinese **nationalism** has two main driving **forces** behind it. The
first is the [projection of the country's great
**rejuvenation**]{.mark}, which entails the [reclaiming of China's
**lost international status**]{.mark} by its rising [within the global
hierarchy and exerting of its influence]{.mark}---therewith [acting as a
role model for other states]{.mark}.]{.underline} The second is the
negative attitude toward Western imperial powers, which inflicted great
pain on China during "the century of humiliation" \[27\]. In the context
of the pandemic, [[state media strongly appealed to this
**nationalism**]{.mark} and crafted narratives that entailed related
elements such as patriotism, collectivism, or [references to **China's
greatness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, several snippets from
the examined media outlets praised China's rise within the global
hierarchy in the context of its goal of national rejuvenation while at
the same time lamenting any perceived blame or criticism directed toward
the country's political system as a direct attack on and insult to the
Chinese people.

Typical of the [**[nationalistic narratives]{.mark}** of China being a
major country now reclaiming its rightful position in the world, as
identified in the analyzed media outlets, is the [construction of an
imagined "**international community**]{.mark}"]{.underline}9 that always
takes its side---thus unanimously supporting and praising its COVID-19
policies and global engagement hereon. For instance, one article in
People's Daily states that: "It is a consensus among the international
community that China's efforts have effectively contained the spread of
the virus to other countries."10 The narrative usually positions this
[envisaged "international community[" **outside** of the realm of the
West's **influence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also becomes apparent how
a [[sense of **belonging** and **collectivism**]{.mark} is nurtured
through this vision of an international community]{.underline}, whereas
claiming that the pandemic originated in Wuhan is cast aside as baseless
whispers:

### I/L---AT: Resilient

#### Xi [legitimacy]{.underline} is stable now, but elites [discontent]{.underline} over [foreign policy]{.underline} and [corruption]{.underline} makes him [vulnerable]{.underline}.

Concentration versus Governance Capability\", *China Leadership
Monitor*,

yc

**[[Xi]{.mark} Jinping has [achieved huge successes]{.mark} in terms of
[concentrating power]{.mark} since coming to office in
2012]{.underline}**, and these achievements reached an overwhelming
triumph at the 20th Party Congress. There are at least two explicit
indicators of this triumph: First, **[Xi overcame political and
institutional obstacles to win a third term to rule over the party, the
state, and the military]{.underline}**. This not only **[dismantled the
leadership norms practiced during the previous three
decades]{.underline}**---from former party chiefs Jiang Zemin and Hu
Jintao---but also paved the way for his **[future additional terms and
even perhaps life-tenure in power]{.underline}**. It seems only a matter
of time before Xi will become a great leader on par with Mao Zedong, the
CCP's God-like figure from the mid-1930s to his death in 1976, a status
unmatched by any other CCP leader.

The second benchmark of Xi's accomplishments in terms of concentrating
power is his reorganization of the top leadership of the Chinese
party-state at the 20th Party Congress, whereby he no longer has any
political insubordinates, let alone any policy adversaries and/or
potential foes. He managed to remove Li Keqiang (former premier) and
Wang Yang (former No. 4 leader) from the Politburo Standing Committee
(PBSC), even though both were younger than Xi and in 2022 had not yet
reached retirement age. Furthermore, all four replacement PBSC members
(in official ranking: Li Qiang, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi) are
his long-time supporters.\[1\] This accomplishment even surpasses Mao's
record, who was never able to form a Politburo and a PBSC made up
exclusively of his long-time followers. Prior to gaining overwhelming
leadership dominance, there are some milestones on the road that Xi had
astonishingly and rapidly traveled to achieve such a concentration of
power. In 2017, after five years in power, he reorganized the CCP
Politburo at the 19th Party Congress, with at least two extraordinary
achievements: He removed three incumbent members who were relatively
young,\[2\] and he promoted at least ten of his protégés to fill the
fifteen vacancies on the powerful leadership body.\[3\] With the
successful sidelining of those leaders who potentially could compete
with Xi's dominance, by the 20th Party Congress in 2022 Xi was able to
assemble a PBSC that was completely aligned with his personal
preferences. Meanwhile, the 19th Party Congress amended the party
charter to include, as a CCP guiding principle, "Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era," alongside
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory
of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development. The
latter two refer to the ideas of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao,
respectively, CCP party chiefs prior to Xi. Neither Jiang nor Hu,
however, was able to have his "theory" included in these guiding
principles until they were about to retire from office, and, when it was
written into the party charter, have his name mentioned.\[4\] In this
sense, Xi's achievement is remarkable.

The next milestone is the 2018 state constitutional amendment that
abolished term limits for president of the People's Republic of China
(PRC), a position Xi had held since 2013. **[This paved the way for Xi
to [remain in power]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2022--23 for a third term
as well as **[[likely beyond the 2027--28]{.mark} leadership
reshuffling.]{.underline}**

The above summary of Xi's major achievements in power suggests that his
power has reached a peak in terms of securing formal positions and
organizational domination, surpassing that of all previous CCP leaders
including Mao Zedong. In contrast, however, **[Xi's record of
[exercising governance power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially since
the 20th Party Congress, **[has been unimpressive, or [remarkably
negative]{.mark}, by objective standards]{.underline}**, that is, in a
general sense, and by subjective expectations, that is, in terms of
fulfilling his own promises.

For some general parameters to assess his governance performance,
**[[Xi's government]{.mark} has [done a poor job]{.mark} in promoting
economic development, managing foreign relations]{.underline}**, and
delivering social benefits to the populace, tasks that an effective
authoritarian regime typically focuses on and that Xi's predecessors
were able to manage particularly well. In terms of the **[GDP growth
rate]{.underline}**, something the regime has been quite proud of as a
major achievement since 1979, **[Xi's regime has performed poorly, as
indicated by the statistics]{.underline}** in Table 1.

Table 1. Latest Economic Performance of Xi Jinping's Regime, 2019--2023

\<\<TABLES OMITTED\>\>

In fact, **[China's [economic growth]{.mark} rate has [continued to
decline]{.mark} since Xi came to power]{.underline}** in 2012, except in
the two cases of 2021 and 2023 when economic growth increased as well as
in 2017 (with a mere 0.10 increase).\[5\] There are many reasons for
such a macrotrend change, but the constant low annual growth rates
during Xi's tenure do suggest some correlations between poor economic
performance and Xi's governance performance.

With respect to the **[[announced goals]{.mark} of the Xi leadership,
such as reducing official corruption in the party-state system and
"bringing [China back to the center of the world
stage]{.mark},"]{.underline}** any accomplishments during his current
term are dubious. **[The continuous purge of party-state cadres and
military generals may be evidence of Xi's firm commitment to these
goals,]{.underline}** but, ironically, they also strongly suggest that,
first, **[Xi's powerful [anti-corruption]{.mark} campaign during his
first two terms was [not as effective]{.mark} as was
claimed]{.underline}**, and, second, as a result, **[his regime today
[is not]{.mark} as [clean]{.mark} as he would like]{.underline}**.
Moreover, corruption has become more serious, as indicated by reports
that in the first half of 2024, the national disciplinary inspection and
supervision system handled more than 12,400 clues about corruption
within its own ranks, and it punished 2,003 supervisory cadres.\[6\] The
latter number is much higher than the number of those punished during
the same period of 2019 (1,600) and 2022 (1,100) but close to the total
amount (2,300) of such cadres who were punished in the entire year in
2022.\[7\] 

It is **[difficult to measure Xi's achievement to "[bring China to the
world's central stage]{.mark}," but the following is at least a
superficial indicator]{.underline}**: From the 20th Party Congress
(October 2022) to July 2024, as this article is being written, Xi paid
visits to 11c ountries; during the corresponding period following the
19th Party Congress, he visited 23 countries; and in the same period
following the 18th Party Congress, he visited 27 countries.\[8\] Many
possible factors can explain this obvious **[[decrease in]{.mark} the
number of [foreign trips]{.mark}, which might include his [declining
health]{.mark} or technical inconveniences in scheduling such
diplomatic]{.underline}** visits, but it [is **[difficult to
conclude]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that Xi's less active role in
diplomacy means China has more actively participated in world affairs,
let alone that it occupies a position on the so-called "[central stage
of the world]{.mark}." [China's absence from]{.mark} the world leaders'
[peace summit]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the Russia-Ukraine War, held in
June 2024 in Switzerland,\[9\] **[further points to this
conclusion.]{.underline}**

**[Everyday [Resistance by CCP Elites]{.mark}]{.underline}**: What Do
the "Three Distinguishes" Tell Us?

The contrast between Xi's formidable power and his frustrated governance
performance raises questions about the exercise, operation, and
effectiveness of Xi's power: Why is Xi not able to transfer his power
successes to the field of governance? Why has Xi's concentration of
power not been helpful for him to carry out his policy programs? How can
we explain the contrast between his power concentration and his
governance ineffectiveness? This article suggests that there is a
paradox between strong power, especially Xi's ultra-concentration of
power, and weak governance being simultaneously embedded in Chinese
communist politics. When the supreme leader's power concentration is
such that the elite are strictly disciplined in a political sense and
the ruling system accordingly is frozen in terms of carrying out its
functions, political control is inevitably actualized at the cost of
effective governance. In an earlier piece, based on such logic, I
presented a case of Xi's self-defeating governance regarding the
military industry.\[10\] In general, the four "i"s help explain this
paradox, i.e., political control harms the information flow from the
bottom up to the decision-makers, hinders policy implementation, damages
the incentives of the governing elites, and reduces the system's
initiatives to perform its functions. No highly centralized system with
tight political control is immune from problems of the four "i"s, and
the Xi regime is in no way an exception. Although space here does not
allow for evidence and analysis of each "i" problem, the following
discussion will take the regime's so-called \"three distinguishes\" as
an example to examine how, given the tight political control, the Xi
regime deals with these problems, especially in terms of implementation,
incentives, and initiatives. The "three distinguishes," as based on the
revised "Regulations on the Protection of the Rights of Members of the
Communist Party of China"《中国共产党党员权利保障条例》, a document
issued by the Central Committee in December 2000, include: "to
distinguish the errors and mistakes made by party members due to a lack
of experience and trial-and-error in the promotion of the reforms from
disciplinary and illegal acts that are knowingly committed, to
distinguish the errors and mistakes in exploratory experiments without
clear restrictions from violations of discipline and the law that
persist despite explicit prohibitions; to distinguish unintentional
mistakes to promote development from violations of discipline and the
law for personal gain."\[11\] These "distinguishes" were initially
proposed by Xi himself in January 2016 to overcome the phenomenon known
as "weiguan buwei" (为官不为), namely, "officials not performing their
duties."\[12\] By 2023, a CCP official website was admitting that this
phenomenon had "become a prominent problem," and it urged that "without
delay, party committees at all levels must not wait to strive to reverse
this situation as soon as possible."\[13\]

the prevailing phenomenon of cadre inactivity exist? The above-cited
website finds the major causes to include **[[cadres' "increased
ideological confusion]{.mark} and [low
enthusiasm]{.mark}."]{.underline}**\[14\] For our analysis, "ideological
confusion" (the original wording is "sixiang hunluan" \[思想混乱\])
refers to **[[cadre discontent]{.mark} with Xi's policy
programs]{.underline}** (to be discussed below), and **[the diagnosis of
"low enthusiasm" provides [straightforward evidence]{.mark} that the
[incentives for]{.mark} China's vast troops of party-state [governing
elites are low]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, an official analysis
identifies three types of cadre inactivity, including "the lack of
motivation, therefore not want to do anything," "insufficient
responsibilities, therefore not daring to act," and "the lack of
ability, therefore not being able to act."\[15\] The former two are
indicative of an incentive problem in the functioning of governance,
while the latter is indicative of a lack of incentives to improve their
governance capabilities.

Furthermore, Xi\'s strict political control over the elites is a
significant factor contributing to the low incentives among cadres. This
led Xi himself to address the issue at the beginning of his third term.
In his speech to the First Plenum of the 20th Central Committee on
October 23, 2022, Xi told his cadres: Comprehensively and strictly
administering the party (全面从严治党) and encouraging
responsibility-taking and effort-making (鼓励担当作为) are intrinsically
unified and not in opposition to each other. Being strict does not mean
controlling everyone deadly (管死), nor does it mean making people
timid, fearful, dull, and as inactive as a pool of stagnant water.
Rather, by clarifying the direction, establishing rules, correcting the
atmosphere, and strengthening immunity to form a clean and upright
political ecology within the party, we should create an environment that
encourages action and fosters initiative, thereby further mobilizing the
positivity, enthusiasm, and creativity of the entire party.\[16\] In
January 2023, in his speech to the Second Plenary Session of the 20th
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Xi again emphasized the
need to combine strict administration with kindness (严管和厚爱结合), to
pay equal attention to incentives and constraints (激励和约束并重), and
to adhere to the "three distinguishes," calling for "better stimulating
the positivity, initiative, and creativity of party members and
cadres."\[17\] In discussing the phenomenon of cadre inactivity, three
points deserve special attention, especially with respect to the
implication of serious limitations to Xi's power. First, with Xi since
2016 constantly talking about the "three distinguishes"\[18\] and, since
the start of his third term emphatically stressing "positivity,
initiative, and creativity," the implication is that cadre inactivity
has been an enduring challenge to the regime and it has not at all been
reduced after he initially noted the problem about eight years ago.
Second, both in 2016, when Xi first raised the problem to a special
seminar class for leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial
levels (省部级主要领导干部专题研讨班) , and in 2022/23, when Xi
addressed the Central Committee and the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, his audience on both occasions was high-ranking
cadres. This implies that such inactivity had already reached the
highest levels of the CCP system, with the problem even existing among
those leaders immediately subordinate to Xi himself. Third, as
implicitly indicated by Xi's above 2022 paragraph, CCP cadres widely
regard Xi's "comprehensively and strictly administering the party" to be
in opposition to their own responsibility-taking and effort-making as
party-state officials, thereby making it necessary for Xi to "clarify"
the "intrinsic unity" between the two. The CCP governing elites' "lying
down" seems evident in the above discussion. Furthermore, I would argue
that such "lying down," or inactivity among cadres, can be viewed as, to
borrow from James Scott's famous concept, an example of "everyday
resistance" by CCP elites to Xi's power and policy.\[19\] As the title
of Scott's book indicates, such everyday resistance is a "weapon of the
weak." Is it the CCP governing elite who are weak? The answer obviously
is "yes" when they are compared to the party chief or to the political
system in which they live, and this is especially the case as the party
chief's power has been growing, expanding, and becoming unprecedently
concentrated. Considering that Xi has achieved such power through his
weapons of anti-corruption and coercive control that target the
governing elites, these elites unquestionably can be regarded as weak
vis-à-vis the party discipline and the party-state coercive apparatuses
that are both tightly controlled by Xi. "The governing elites as the
weak," however, is a self-contradictory phrase, as the cadres are of
course powerful in terms of governing, despite politically how weak they
are in the system under Xi. When they choose not to do their jobs,
governance inevitably becomes paralyzed, and policy is not implemented
in the manner expected by the policy makers. Furthermore, for a system
as large as the CCP ruling machine and as large as the country of China,
national policies require implementation initiatives by the governing
elite to meet the various local conditions. When local governing elites
lack incentives to take initiatives, policy implementation inevitably
becomes bogged down. In brief, Xi must rely on these elites to carry out
the tasks of governance. But when these elites become involved in
everyday resistance in terms of performing their governance
responsibilities, Xi's formidable power meets a fundamental limitation
in terms of being capable of effectively governing the country. The
Mutually Enforcing Dynamic Ends in Deadlock: Xi Becomes Victim of His
Own Trap Xi's governance program, of course, has its own intrinsic
problems, especially because of its fundamental anti-market position and
its anti-West nationalism that are counterproductive in promoting
China's economic development and global cooperation. Such problems,
however, facilitated the rise of Xi's power concentration, becoming what
I call "a policy-power mutually enforcing dynamic." With the increasing
elite resistance, the situation seems to be changing in a direction
whereby the dynamic becomes a trap. In China's domestic political
economy prior to Xi's ascent to power, CCP governing elites increased
their public power and, in both legal and illegal ways, reaped huge
private benefits through rent-seeking, or, power-money exchanges, under
the authoritarian state-market nexus.\[20\] China's official corruption,
therefore, is not simply a problem of individual behavior but rather an
institutional phenomenon embedded in the power arrangements that nurture
communist-capitalist collaboration. In other words, the so-called China
model which, following the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989, combines the
CCP's monopoly of public power with capitalist market mechanisms,
promoted China's economic prosperity and, simultaneously, facilitated
rampant official corruption. Economic prosperity has strengthened both
the legitimacy and the material strength of the CCP, while corruption
and, behind it, the elite networks of power-money exchanges, have
bankrupted the communist ideology and, potentially, present a major
challenge to the CCP's unified control over resources and power. When he
came to power, Xi deliberately highlighted the challenges, as he clearly
indicated in his report to the 20th Party Congress when referring to the
"situation of a decade ago." According to his own description, "Back
then, many people, both inside and outside our party, were worried about
the future of the party and the country" because there were "acute
problems and challenges, which undermined the party's long-term ruling,
the security and stability of the country, and the well-being of the
people."\[21\] Accordingly, Xi sought to concentrate his power to tackle
these challenges, especially the negative consequences, that is,
primarily the cadre corruption, that plagued the China model. As we
understand, through the powerful anti-corruption campaigns Xi actualized
his concentration of power and, at the same time, promoted anti-market
and anti-West policies. I argue that Xi intentionally tied his
concentration of power to his policy program to enhance their mutual
reinforcement while advancing his status as the great leader of China.
With this policy-power link, Xi, in the name of tackling the negative
consequences of the market reforms that threaten the CCP's monopoly of
power, utilizes an anti-market policy to promote and justify his
concentration of power, and, in turn, uses the latter to initiate and
implement the former. This strategy mobilized both the ideological and
organizational resources of the CCP system, the two most important
resources that the system possesses,\[22\] to empower Xi as party
leader. Xi can thus easily justify and even glorify his policy program
based on CCP ideology; the party's organizational principle allows only
Xi as the party chief to propose ideas to "guide" the party's course.
Utilizing both party ideology and party organization, and based on his
determination and ruling tactics, Xi speedily turned himself into a
visionary leader and, accordingly, a formidable and powerful leader.

Xi's power and policy have both greatly hurt the interests of the CCP
governing elites, however. Xi's power is rooted in CCP institutions and
his policy is rooted in CCP ideology, and all the elites are dependent
on the institutions and are bound by CCP ideology, therefore, they are
fundamentally constrained from taking any effective steps of resistance
that will block Xi's triumph in the battle over power. But for
governance, Xi depends on the system, and the **[[system's functioning
depends on]{.mark} the [party-state cadres]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
**[[elite resistance takes everyday forms]{.mark}, [primarily
inactivity]{.mark} in terms of performing their governance functions,
[Xi loses the battle to govern]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or, at least, he
is **[placed in a disadvantageous position in any attempt to confront
the elites such that they will improve governance]{.underline}**. As the
CCP governing elites are also an integral part of the CCP institutions
upon which Xi relies, it seems that, despite his formidable power, **[Xi
has [not been able to win them over.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Because of this mutually enforcing dynamic, **[[elite
resistance]{.mark}, even in the simple form of elite
discontent]{.underline}** with the current anti-market policies, not
only **[[negatively affects the governance performance]{.mark} of the
regime but also leads to [serious worries on Xi's]{.mark} part about his
[own power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus **[Xi's hunger for
power]{.underline}** during his first ten years in office has now
**[developed into a power paranoia]{.underline}**, whereby any negative
responses to his leadership, however slight, can be regarded as threats,
thus **[[significantly reducing]{.mark} any space for [policy
adjustments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this sense, Xi is **[[locked in
by his own strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** that formerly had been
successful in empowering him as China's great new leader. This also
means, regardless of the extent of Xi's power, it is still a serious
handicap in terms of any policy initiatives to improve his governance.
The recent Third Plenum of the CCP's 20th Central Committee is one such
example, further highlighting Xi's dilemma.

Conclusion The question, "Has Xi Jinping peaked in power," can be
answered from multiple perspectives, but this article approaches to
answer it by exploring three sub-questions: Will Xi's concentration of
power further increase? How does Xi exercise his power in terms of
achieving his political and governance programs? Will his power be
sufficiently powerful to overcome any obstacles, if there are any such
obstacles, to make any achievements?

To all of these three sub-questions, the answer in this article is
negative. With his already vast and historically unparalleled
concentration of power, **[there seems to be little space for his power
to increase further]{.underline}**, at least in a formal or
organizational sense, while it is also difficult for his authority and
non-organizational influence to grow. His record of governance has not
been positive, and it is widely thought to be responsible for China's
economic slowdown and various governance crises. In analyzing why such a
gap exists between Xi's successful power concentration and his
**[[regime's poor performance]{.underline}]{.mark}** in terms of
governance, the above sections, paying **[special attention to the
[responses by CCP elites]{.mark}, argue that [Chinese elites]{.mark}
today, through inactivity to perform their governance duties, are taking
everyday [forms of resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The reach of Xi's
power, despite how vast and formidable it may be politically, is thus
limited in terms of governance administration and policy implementation.

#### CPC [legitimacy]{.underline} is recovering now by increasing national prestige, but citizen [discontent]{.underline} creates a [vulnerability]{.underline} now.

In other words, under Xi, **[[the promise of CCP rule began
changing]{.mark} from the unfettered wealth generation of Deng's
economic prosperity legitimacy [to a balance of
econ]{.mark}]{.underline}**omic well-being,
**[[security,]{.underline}]{.mark}** fairness, **[[national unity, and
international respect]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which collectively compose
the idea that we call national populism, but which the Chinese state
called "socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era."36 This
formulation concedes that the overall **[[Chinese Dream]{.mark} might
[provide fewer economic benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}** to individuals
than might have been implied under Hu.

This new position revises---rather than overturns---the legacy of
legitimacy through economic prosperity. The Chinese Dream argues that
performance legitimacy predicated on economic growth is necessary but
remains inadequate to realize national rejuvenation. The Chinese Dream
leverages the economic wealth that China has accrued and promises to use
it to meet the new objectives of populism within China and nationalism
on the world stage. In Marxist terms, **[China's economic
base]{.underline}** had developed to a point at which it can **[[now
begin to affect]{.mark}]{.underline}** domestic and **[[international
sociopolitical superstructures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This position
deeply anchors the personal objectives of wealth accrual with
**[[national objectives of popular support and international
prestige]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to Professor Xin, "a
**[[Chinese person's dream is inseparable from
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** wealth and **[[power of his
country]{.underline}]{.mark}** and that of his countrymen. Only in this
way will each of our individual dreams stand on solid ground and a true
possibility of realization."37

Cultivating a Populist Image CCP scholars and propagandists continued to
burnish the party's populist credentials to build public credibility. In
2015, the Central Party School's official newspaper Study Times
published an unusually long article that explicitly discusses "From
Whence Comes the CCP's Capacity to Lead."38 This article emphasizes that
party cadres must have "both ability and political integrity" and
characterizes the latter as "hard work, plain living, honesty, and
dedication to the public" that arises from a "rich grassroots
experience."39 The article explains that the "CCP has a special
institutional arrangement" for party cadres to train at the grassroots
and that this institutional arrangement also serves as a mechanism for
party leaders to empower cadres "who are grounded and have practical
experience dealing with complex problems. This is an important source of
the CCP's capacity to lead."40 The Study Times article claims that the
CCP deserves to lead because it has adopted values and experiences that
resonate with the populace, which Chinese press call the grassroots. In
the years preceding the Study Times article's publication, People's
Daily had been trumpeting the "Grassroots Everywhere" model that Xi had
supposedly innovated while party secretary of the city of Ningde in the
1980s.41 Hagiographic coverage of Xi's early career emphasized that his
life was "no different from that of cadres at the grassroots" despite Xi
having held prestigious staff positions supporting the State Council and
CMC.42 Between 2012 and 2014, Xi conducted wellpublicized tours of
Chinese cities and provinces in an effort that the CCP described as
"going deep into the front lines of the grassroots to seek out the
people's will, investigate the people's circumstances and sentiment, and
inquire about their livelihoods."43 State media coverage shows Xi
identifying the people's challenges and demanding better outcomes for
the grassroots when meeting with the Politburo, and in 2023, the CCP's
publishing house released a volume of his speeches as Excerpts of Xi
Jinping's Essays on Grassroots Governance. 44 Publishing a Comprehensive
Theory of National Populism The dual threads of populism and deriving
legitimacy from sources other than economic growth were most clearly
aligned in a 2021 article published in the Journal of the Party School
of Hangzhou, which is overseen by the Hangzhou Municipal Party
Committee. The article by Ren Zhongping, a professor of politics and
administration at China West Normal University, cogently explained the
CCP's new claims to legitimacy.45 Ren's basic argument was simple: "a
ruling party needs support from political legitimacy and from political
effectiveness, and the two are interdependent and indispensable."46

Ren diagnosed **[[overreliance on economic growth]{.mark} as a major
problem for the CCP that [Xi decisively resolved]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
"Since Reform and Opening," Ren explains, "**[the Party [turned to
economic construction]{.mark} as the center and maintained its political
legitimacy through improving economic performance]{.underline}**."47
Still, according to Ren, "**[a pure performance legitimacy strategy
[cannot serve as the foundation of legitimacy]{.mark} for the entire
political system]{.underline}**, and it is easy to fall into the
'performance legitimacy dilemma'" of **[[high corruption, growing wealth
inequality]{.mark}, and the misalignment of economic and social
development]{.underline}**.48 According to Ren, even "leading cadres
unilaterally pursued economic growth while ignoring social development
and issues affecting the people's livelihood," which undermined the
CCP's capacity to govern.49

In Ren's account, the **[[CCP under Xi's leadership]{.mark} resolved
these problems and [restored the party's
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, **[Xi led [an "unprecedented
anticorruption campaign]{.mark}" and "vigorously promoted developing
comprehensive and [strict Party governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"
which **[corrected the excesses of economic prosperity
legitimacy]{.underline}** and returned the party's focus to serving the
people's interest.50 Second, Xi "faced the turning point of development
in the new era" and "solved a series of governance problems" by
proposing and implementing a policy package to "comprehensively deepen
reform, improve and develop for a New Era a 'socialist system with
Chinese characteristics'" that maintained economic growth while making
China "a major global player."51 In other words, Ren assesses that the
CCP under Xi's leadership reasserted populist interests by curbing
corruption and improving the party's performance while elevating China's
global standing. Although Ren does not use the term national populism,
his core argument appears to be that Xi has delivered on the Chinese
Dream and thereby enhanced political legitimacy by moving beyond
economic prosperity legitimacy to national populism.

The National Populism Policy Agenda Xi completed the transition to a new
basis of political legitimacy through three important steps. First, he
modified the governance agenda by shifting away from a focus on economic
benefits to the provision of security and the preservation of life for
each Chinese individual. Second, he complemented the party's effort to
build a more-competent, well-trained cadre through an anticorruption
campaign. Third, he increased the party's ideological focus on the
vision of national revival and his personal authority. In particular, he
emphasized the defense of the nation's interests, dignity, and prestige.
Xi advanced the Chinese Dream as an overarching vision that captured all
three of these themes. Upon taking office, Xi clarified that the
government did not have the resources to deliver on the promises made by
the previous government. On the one hand, Xi continued to promote the
idea that the CCP should provide sound governance. He published a book,
The Governance of China, that explained how the party could improve
governance in virtually all policy fields.52 On the other hand, the
reality of decelerating growth rates meant that the CCP would have
diminishing resources to address the needs of a massive population. By
2011, the country had already begun to deindustrialize. From 2019 to
2021, China's annual GDP growth averaged between 6 and 7 percent, and it
declined further in response to the shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic.53
The CCP's ambitious governance agenda stumbled in the face of severe
fiscal constraints. Xi acknowledged this problem at the Third Plenary of
the 18th Party Congress, when he announced a "new era" defined by a
"main contradiction" between the "ever growing needs of the people for a
better life" and the country's "unbalanced and inadequate
development."54 This contradiction posed a major problem for the
economic prosperity legitimacy claims because of its recognition that
individuals expected to gain some benefit in exchange for their
political support. One way to overcome the contradiction would be for
the government to carefully select the benefits that it could afford to
provide citizens. Under Xi, the government's provision of health care,
pensions, unemployment, and education all made relatively little
progress, which was mostly like because of each of those benefits'
enormous expense for a population of over 1.4 billion.55 China's
government made some progress, especially in efforts to reduce poverty
in rural areas.56 However, overall, China's social welfare system
remained threadbare for most citizens.

**[Instead, Xi's government focused on the provision of
security]{.underline}**, the promotion of fair institutions and rules,
and the preservation of life as direct benefits for the people. He also
**[[stepped-up measures to enhance]{.mark} the [country's national
dignity and prestige]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In many ways, this focus on
fairness, individual life, **[national security, and [national prestige
represented a much more affordable agenda for a resource-strapped
governmen]{.mark}t]{.underline}**. This agenda also bolstered the
government's long-standing concern about instability and the
proliferation of threats

Underscoring this point, Xi created the National Security Commission,
which he charged with coordinating all security activities domestically
and abroad. He also articulated a "comprehensive security concept" that
blurred the lines between traditional military and law enforcement and
expanded the realm of security policy to economics, culture, politics,
and other domains.57 China's government carried out crackdowns on a wide
range of perceived threats, including pop culture, foreign media, and
crime, among others. The ramp-up in digital surveillance, police
control, and repression struck many observers as reflecting an
"obsession" with security or an overall "securitization" of policy.58
China's effort to demonstrate its ability to provide security manifested
clearly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government aimed to eliminate
COVID-19 through extensive quarantine, suppression, and lockdown
measures, which it called Zero-COVID. The government's efforts to
contain COVID-19 initially resulted in a relatively lower death toll.
The government prioritized the preservation of life over economic
growth, which resulted in a costly reduction of economic activity.
Although the government's effort to preserve life initially enjoyed wide
public support, the mounting economic costs and stifling restrictions
gradually eroded public support. Eventually, the enormous cost of the
Zero-COVID policy and the spread of highly contagious variants persuaded
China's government to abandon the policy. To minimize discontent, the
government suppressed reports on the surge in deaths that followed the
easing of the policy.59 Xi also oversaw more assertive and patriotic
policies. Relying heavily on paramilitary forces, such as maritime
militia and China's Coast Guard, China contended more actively with
neighbors in the South China Sea and East China Sea over disputed
maritime territory. In 2012, China gained control of Scarborough Reef.60
In subsequent years, Beijing directed a robust buildup of artificial
islands in the South China Sea. Chinese ships and aircraft swarmed near
the Senkaku Islands on frequent occasions, and PLA troops brawled
against Indian troops on the border in 2021, which resulted in the
deaths of 20 Indian and several Chinese soldiers.61 China's military
deployed two more prestigious aircraft carriers and successfully sent a
lunar probe, all of which received ample flag-waving press.62 Public
Support for National Populism

Public support for CCP policies appeared to affirm national populism
under Xi. Despite key setbacks, including popular protests over China's
ZeroCOVID policy, the Chinese public has appeared relatively supportive
of the central leadership since 2013. In particular, academic research
in the Xi era shows Chinese citizens have generally positive implicit
trust in the CCP regime, independent of their explicitly stated trust.63
However**[, [the state's inability to provide equitable
services]{.mark}, fairness, and opportunity [continues to remain a major
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which has been shown by the
**[[low levels of support expressed by Chinese citizens for the local
officials]{.underline}]{.mark}** responsible for day-to-day governance.

#### CCP legitimacy is on the [brink]{.underline} now.

with a series of policy choices that go to the core of the regime, and
the foundations of the power exercised by the monopoly Communist Party
(CCP).

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The market-minded economic model presided over by Deng Xiaoping in the
late 1970s after the death of Mao Zedong was, beneath its immediate
economic effects, a political project aimed at making China Great Again
and giving the CCP, which Deng had served since the 1920s, a new
legitimacy as the deliverer of greater prosperity and national
well-being. In place of Mao's collectivism, individuals were to be made
free to get rich. It was an offer to which they responded en masse.
Instead of the isolation and autarky of the Mao era, markets were sought
abroad, and foreign assistance was accepted to fuel China's revival as
Western and Japanese companies lined up to get a slice of the new
business frontier, and the world lapped up low-cost Chinese goods. The
combined global impact made the reform and opening up programme the most
important global event since the end of the Cold War. Mao had changed
China; Deng changed the world. There were, however, limits to the degree
of liberalisation Deng and his successors envisaged. Foreign investors
were welcomed -- so long as they contributed to China's growth and
technological advancement, and agreed to form joint ventures.
Maintaining the CCP's supremacy was always the essential priority. No
questioning of the pillars of the regime was permitted. Despite some
delegation of top-level policy implementation to ministers, especially
during the 1998-2003 premiership of the take-no-prisoners moderniser Zhu
Rongji, the government remained subordinate to the Party in terms of
authority. In the capital and the provinces, Party officials took
precedence over administrative officials. As became evident with the
brutal suppression of the protests of 1989 in Beijing and other cities,
the Deng programme of 'reform and opening up' had strict limits; while
people could get rich by their own efforts, they had to leave politics
to the Party in a bargain well understood in a nation that had never
known competitive democracy and had been ruled in its glory days by
autocrats claiming to be semi-divine and to possess the Mandate of
Heaven. Western forecasts that, as the Chinese grew richer, they would
press for the ruling system to liberalise and thus become 'more like us'
were either naïve make-believe or a smokescreen for corporate ambitions.
The newly-emerging middle class, which some foreign observers saw as the
motor of change, counted its blessings from the new state of the nation
and became a bulwark of the regime, which continued to exercise the
traditional system of rule by law, rather than rule of law, from which
the Party remained immune. Despite the rise of Chinese private
businesses, the state sector remained omnipresent and well protected by
its political masters in Beijing. While private leasehold of real estate
was introduced in the 1990s and set off a boom that made real estate a
major contributor to growth, the basic ownership of all land continued
to be in the hands of the state or collectives, and local authorities
made the most of their title deeds to boost the property boom. Deng's
successors -- the wily Jiang Zemin, and then the less forceful Hu Jintao
-- continued the system he had set in place, complete with limited
liberalising of society and encouragement of private enterprise, which
provided the main stimulus for growth. Their eras saw China becoming the
manufacturing workshop of the world, with assembly lines for both
domestic and foreign enterprises staffed by millions of migrant workers
from the countryside, the debt-driven growth of major companies,
including e-commerce giants such as Alibaba, and the sprawling expansion
of property behemoths along with a huge misallocation of capital,
exorbitant spending by local authorities, the development of serious
excess capacity in numerous sectors -- and the accumulation of fortunes
that made the nation's big cities a goldmine for purveyors of luxury
goods. With China expanding to become the world's second biggest economy
and the combination of growth and repression providing a political and
social safety net, the leadership saw no reason to change course. A lot
of people in positions of power were doing too well materially to
envisage any alterations to the system. Still, some analysts quibbled
with the official growth numbers, warned of the growing debt mountain,
and pointed to the country's dependence on infrastructure spending,
inefficient use of capital, and low level of consumption. In a telling
interjection in 2007, the Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, warned that the
economic trajectory was 'unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and
unsustainable'. But he then promoted a massive infrastructure-led
stimulus package in response to the world financial downturn of 2008,
which turbo-charged China's growth, but only exacerbated the instability
and imbalances of which he had warned. As high-speed trains powered
their way across the country, airports bloomed in out-of-the-way regions
and city centres put the West to shame in trappings of modernity, the
Communist Party earned what became known as 'performance legitimacy',
bolstering the trust of the nation as it delivered material gains in
place of political and social freedoms. But, on taking the country's top
job as General Secretary of the CCP at the end of 2012 (followed by the
State Presidency and the Chair of the Central Military Commission), Xi
Jinping made plain that he felt the political system had allowed itself
to be weakened internally under his predecessors. His overwhelming
priority was to increase the Party's grip and to strengthen the CCP.
Politics in its most brutal form took precedence over economics as the
new chieftain asserted himself, reinforcing China's age-old
authoritarian system on the way to making himself the new emperor. The
son of an historic Communist leader who had been purged by Mao and then
re-instated in powerful positions by Deng, Xi saw the CCP and the nation
as having been sapped by corruption, factionalism and rent-seeking by
officials, as the 'shopkeepers' like Hu Jintao presumed to take over the
place that rightfully belonged to 'princelings' such as himself. Strong
leadership by the only permitted leading force -- the Communist Party --
was needed to assert his own supremacy and to achieve the 'China Dream'
of national rejuvenation, with a top-down stress on national security,
military modernisation, internal surveillance -- and the pledge to unite
Taiwan with the mainland, by force if necessary. Some foreign observers
saw Xi as a potential reformer; they were wrong, and were soon
disabused. He was a hard-line power player who became a model for
dictators round the world, and won praise from Donald Trump as a 'smart,
brilliant' ruler who 'runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist'. Real
or potential foes were ruthlessly defenestrated in a huge, rolling
purge, launched in the name of the fight against corruption. This
brought down high-ranking CCP figures as well as legions of lower-level
Party members in central or local government. Political power centres
were dismantled or sidelined. Private business was to be tolerated only
so long as it followed the Party's dictates. The Politburo was filled
with loyal Xi lieutenants and factions sidelined or eliminated as the
new emperor built up his status as 'core leader' and overturned term
limits on his office. Far from being a short-lived exercise in power,
his purge has continued to this day, spreading, most recently, to top
commanders in the armed forces. Despite this accretion of personal
power, accomplished to an extent that hasn't been seen since Mao Zedong,
Xi has kept on waving the flag of struggle, resilience, and loyalty to
national destiny while repeatedly warning of foreign plots to undermine
China and its leadership. The comparison with Stalin is evident. Control
was the watchword, and, for Xi and his acolytes in the Politburo,
control knows no limits. Instead of banking on the money-making freedom
of individuals to revive China and support the CCP, as Deng had, the
leadership moved back to promoting the collective state in which
belonging to an increasingly powerful nation was reason enough to
require loyalty. A document circulated in the Party in 2013 outlawed
seven 'Western values', including constitutional democracy, universal
values, legal independence and media freedom, as being aimed at
undermining Chinese society and its ruling party's authority. Deng's
limited delegation of authority was reversed by taking decision-making
powers over such matters as economic policy from the government into the
Politburo, and increasing the role of the Party-State. The high degree
of autonomy promised to Hong Kong by the Joint Declaration signed by
China and Britain in 1984 was overturned by draconian national security
regulations imposed by Beijing. At the same time, Xi sought to supplant
those sectors of society or the economy that threatened to escape the
rigid control of the Party-State, be they tycoons like Jack Ma of
Alibaba, who had prospered under the less statist system of Xi's
predecessors, domestic finance houses, or the Uyghurs of Xinjiang. Any
questioning of the official version of China's past was denounced as
'historical nihilism', which was blamed for the collapse of the Soviet
Union. The freedom of public service employees to travel abroad has been
restricted by requiring them to hand in their passport. Censorship was
ramped up as transparency -- for instance over economic data -- was
restricted in the name of national security. Images of Winnie the Pooh
were banned after an Internet meme had compared the full-bellied bear to
the somewhat rotund Xi Jinping, while a book on the ill-fated last
emperor of the Ming dynasty was withdrawn from sale after online
postings had drawn parallels between him and the general secretary.

**[Continuing [economic growth in the first years]{.mark} of his rule
[gave Xi and]{.mark} his focus on politics and [Party room to
breathe]{.mark}]{.underline}** as he enforced his top-down paradigm for
the nation, summed up by an expert on Xi Jinping Thought as 'One China,
One Ideology, One Party, One People, One Leader'. The **[[rate of
expansion]{.mark} might have [fallen]{.mark} from the turbo-charged
years of his predecessors]{.underline}**, but the economy, as a whole,
was much bigger and so the degree of wealth creation helped to sustain
the regime, even if domestic consumption remained low by the standards
of a country China's size, making expansion too dependent on investment
and exports. Downturns in the growth trajectory were met with stimulus
packages that poured more money into industry and construction.

The trade tariffs of Trump's first term were shrugged off or evaded,
while Western businesses remained keen to expand their presence on the
mainland, be it in finance, cars or chemicals. To establish China as a
major force in the cyber-world, Xi launched a well-funded drive to
develop a high technology industry that would free it from the threat of
US sanctions. In pursuit of this ambition, he preached the doctrine of
'self-reliance' to reduce China's dependence on foreign suppliers,
backed by a 'whole-nation approach' to rally the country's resources
behind what he repeatedly describes as the most challenging global
environment the People's Republic has faced. He also counted on the
Party-State to deliver 'made in China' technological progress as 'new
quality productive forces' ushered in a new phase for the nation and
ensured that it out-paces the United States with innovations such as the
recent DeepSeek artificial intelligence breakthrough.

**[There were some [warning voices from within the]{.mark} system even
as it became [more and more hermetically sealed]{.mark} and [dependent
on the recurrent stimulus packages]{.mark} and exports to maintain
expansion]{.underline}**. In 2016, an anonymous 'authoritative figure'
(presumably a highly-placed official) warned in an article published in
the Party's main newspaper, People's Daily, that the People's Republic
faced an 'L-shaped trend', meaning that, after declining (in the form of
the vertical stroke of the letter), growth would be very slow to
recover, mimicking the horizontal part of the L. But growth still
motored along at over six per cent. Excess capacity continued to expand,
generating unhealthy cut-throat competition among producers, and exports
rose, accounting for 20 per cent of GDP in 2020.

Then Covid struck, bringing a deceleration beyond any control mechanism
the Politburo could conjure up. Annual growth fell to 2.24 per cent in
2020. The draconian clampdown against the pandemic was widely accepted
by the population to begin with as a necessary measure, but then it
became widely resented and undermined the regime's claim to be acting in
the interests of its citizens at large. The pandemic buttressed the
control Xi prized so highly, but ended by threatening to arouse popular
resistance -- not to mention the economic cost. However, since the
leadership abruptly switched course with the lifting of the lockdown at
the end of 2022, deflationary pressures have continued, leading to the
present challenges facing the last major state ruled by a Communist
Party.

The problems Xi faces run too deep to be ignored. Their very depth means
that dealing with them would force him to confront the political
challenge inherent in structural change for a regime that has always
founded its policies on one basic consideration -- the preservation of
CCP rule.

**[The [public mood is morose]{.mark} as the fault lines inherent in the
economic policies of the previous decade come home to roost. [Trust
in]{.mark} the regime's [ability to deliver the 'China Dream' has
declined, threatening its legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
**[[leadership is more removed than ever]{.mark} from ordinary citizens;
the [p]{.mark}rime [m]{.mark}inister, who [used to act as a rod
connecting the Party with the people]{.mark}, no longer does
so]{.underline}**. Talk at the top about pursuing 'common prosperity' to
spread the benefits of wealth more evenly has receded while the
nationalist-military flag is waved repeatedly. The crash of
over-extended property developers has had ripple effects through
supplier industries, from steel to furniture, and hit millions of
households that put their money into real estate in the expectation of
ever-rising values and in the absence of other investment vehicles.
Local governments that had cashed in on a real estate boom were left
exposed when projects stalled or turned into financial disasters.

The promise of high-tech progress central to Xi Jinping's message is a
source of national pride, but this may not outweigh everyday concerns
for many households as it does little to boost the pay packets or living
conditions of those outside the IT sphere. In 2021, the term 'lying
flat' was coined to describe young people who rejected the need for hard
work and the '996' working pattern -- shifts from 9am to 9pm, six days a
week; the trend was large enough to provoke a warning against it from Xi
Jinping in an article in a Party journal. The falling birth rate and
increase in life expectancy have punched a big hole in China's
'demographic dividend'. The natural population growth rate has fallen
steadily, despite official efforts to encourage births: a long-term
decline in fertility, urbanisation and the cost of having children are
among the factors. Chinese society continues to be highly unequal.
Extreme poverty has fallen sharply -- Xi declares that 100 million
people have been lifted out of that state on his watch -- but the
rural-urban wealth divide remains wide. In 2020, the then Prime
Minister, Li Keqiang, said that 600 million people were still living on
monthly incomes at or below 1,000 yuan (\$154). Stimulus packages bring
diminishing returns now that the low-hanging fruit has already been
gathered by previous pump-priming. Consumption remains minimal for an
economy of China's size, at around 53 per cent of GDP -- ten points
below the 63-64 per cent of GDP that independent economists believe it
needs as a bare minimum for sustainability. The traditional penchant for
putting money aside as a precaution for bad times, a natural enough
reflex after China's tumultuous history of the past two centuries, has
been perpetuated for decades by inadequate welfare provisions that boost
the need of many people to save to pay for health care, education and
retirement, particularly for the 250 million or so migrant workers who
are not covered by the sparse general protection that does exist. This
savings habit was heightened by the impact of Covid and the
impoverishment caused by the property crash: total savings are now put
at \$20 trillion. Small businesses at the bottom of the supply chain are
growing more risk averse. Restaurants report declining business and some
European suppliers of luxury goods are reviewing the dependence they
have built up on sales to those with money to spare in China's big
cities. Though the country is in no mood to increase discretionary
spending and productivity has fallen, manufacturers keep ramping up
production in keeping with the Deng formula and Xi's supply side
beliefs; China now produces as much steel as the rest of the world put
together. The resulting excess capacity makes it increasingly dependent
on exports at a time when major markets are growing leery of the
People's Republic and levying trade sanctions. Even if the second Trump
administration did not immediately implement the 60 per cent levies
mentioned by the president on the campaign trail, Trump has recently
announced that 20 per cent tariffs will be imposed on all Chinese
imports to the US from 4 March, doubling those that were put in place in
February. Though some companies are doing well, particularly if they
have aligned with the Big State message, corporate profits are under
strain, and the producer price index is down 2.8 per cent on the past
year. The property crash following the collapse of the heavily-indebted
Evergrande empire has left real estate space worth an estimated \$400
billion unoccupied, hitting suppliers of steel and concrete, furniture
and white goods makers, not to mention foreign commodity producers, as
well as property-investing households, local authority finances and
construction jobs. Unemployment has been rising steadily, and would be
even higher if excess capacity was eliminated; the jobless increase was
so steep among young workers that the authorities stopped publishing
data for a time, and then came up with a figure of 21 per cent. The
finances of some local governments are so bereft that in 2024 a dozen
provinces were ordered by Beijing to cancel infrastructure projects, and
there were reports of employees in some areas simply not being paid.
Even the bright spots have their darker lining. Some sectors where China
leads the world, such as electric vehicles and solar power equipment,
suffer from excess capacity, leading the Politburo to inveigh against
what it calls 'vicious involutionary competition'. The steel industry
may dominate world production but domestic prices have fallen by 16 per
cent in a year and barely any mills are profitable. While exports have
held up well, they are running into increased tariff walls in western
economies and often, as with steel and electric vehicles, reflect the
imbalance between the volume of production in China and the soggy state
of domestic demand, leaving manufacturers reliant on foreign sales to
try to balance their books. Meanwhile, increasing restrictions enforced
in the name of national security by the Party State are hitting foreign
companies and the flow of finance into China, with the European Union
Chamber of Commerce warning last September that a 'tipping point' had
been reached in which 'maybe other markets are becoming more
competitive, more attractive' and some Chinese manufacturers are
off-shoring in a bid to escape US and European tariffs. The 2024 growth
target of five per cent was duly hit after an improvement in the last
quarter of the year, according to the official announcement (though
independent analysts believe the true figure is considerably lower). But
corporate profits fell by three per cent over the year, and 2025 began
with a contraction of manufacturing activity in January, according to
official data. Even if the leaders cry triumph in their long march to
surpass the West, it is apparent that China needs a new economic model.
The choice before Xi Jinping is simple, but devilishly difficult; he can
try to continue the old model by launching a series of stimulus packages
that will pump up the economy, infrastructure and property -- for a
while, at least. This would be a major undertaking, straining state
finances. A group of foreign investment bank economists estimated in
October that an injection of \$1.4 trillion would be needed to combat
deflation to start with, while local government debt has risen to 80 per
cent of GDP. Alternatively, Xi can accept that China's problems are
structural and will not be solved by short-term cyclical measures, and
start putting right the deep and broad flaws left by the growth
explosion. While that would be the right way to go, it runs the double
political risk of upsetting the ruling system and discomforting
important sectors of society, which have benefitted from the expansion
launched by Deng half-a-century ago. Uncertainty over which policy route
to adopt seemed evident in the autumn of 2024 after the stock market
reflected deteriorating conditions by registering a continuing
three-year decline. Early in October, the authorities first made known,
in broad terms, that a stimulus package was coming, with measures to
help local governments, put money into the pockets of people on low
incomes, support the property market and boost the capital of banks.
This sent the depressed stock market spiraling upwards in the hope of a
'big bazooka' to revive the economy. But, when the details of the
measures came a few days later, there was less meat than anticipated as
if, knowing the problems that had piled up from previous 'bazookas',
planners were reluctant to add significantly to the debt burden to pay
for increased structural change, including better social protection and
a meaningful bail out of the real estate sector. As disappointment set
in, markets fell back, with the growing danger of a loss of public
confidence in whether the regime knew the best course forward. Finally,
meeting in early 2025, the Party's top body, the Politburo, acknowledged
the need for 'more active' policies with a 'moderately loose' monetary
approach, using language not deployed since the global financial crisis
16 years earlier. But there was still no sign of the necessary
structural changes to set China on a new, more solid course. Ensconced
amid the lakes and lawns of the walled-in leadership estate beside the
Forbidden City in Beijing, or meeting foreign leaders on carefully
orchestrated occasions, Xi Jinping presents a confident, unruffled
appearance behind the screen of national security he has erected, free
from opposition and such troublesome restrictions as term limits on his
presidency. Well on his way to fulfilling the role of an absolute ruler
from a previous age, he has made himself China's latest emperor at the
head of a dynasty that claims its own Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist Mandate
of Heaven and whose mandarins are united in reciting the liturgy of Xi
Jinping Thought as the key to making the People's Republic the centre of
a new world order as the East rises inexorably and the West declines.

However, **[[the imperial parallels]{.mark} contain an uncomfortable
note]{.underline}**; it was when emperors became isolated and failed to
deliver material improvements that they were at their weakest. From the
start, the CCP has made sure that there is no organised opposition
waiting for its demise. But, having completed his political ascent on
the back of the Deng-era economic reforms, **[[Xi now faces a moment of
truth]{.underline}]{.mark}** as far as society and the economy are
concerned, with **[[major implications for]{.mark} the [political
system]{.mark} he dominates.]{.underline}** The issues the country
confronts run well beyond the cyclical responses used since 2008 in the
form of stimulus packages and financial re-wiring. They require
structural changes that, inevitably, will affect the framework on which
the Communist Party has based its power, and risk alienating many of
those who have profited from the status quo. But, one is tempted to ask,
what is the point of Xi's accretion of power if it is not to shake up
the system he inherited?

Why They Are Unlikely to Stop\", Asia Society,

The final months of 2024 witnessed a **[[new wave of purges]{.mark} in
Xi Jinping's China]{.underline}**. On November 28, the **[[Defense
Ministry announced]{.mark} the [suspension from his duties of
Admiral]{.mark} Miao Hua]{.underline}**, the **[[number four military
leader]{.underline}]{.mark}** below Xi, who oversaw the political and
organizational work of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Miao's ouster
makes him the third PLA general in charge of political and
organizational work Xi has purged, and the second of the six members of
the 20th Central Military Commission. An official announcement in late
December also confirmed the removal of two former PLA generals from the
National People's Congress (NPC), You Haitao, former deputy commander of
the PLA Ground Force, and Li Pengcheng, former commissar of the PLA's
Southern Theater Command Navy.

**[Rumors of more purges have been circulating]{.underline}** but they
are often impossible to verify, especially when they involve
high-ranking PLA officers. In late November, the Financial
Times reported that **[[Defense Minister]{.mark} Dong Jun was [under
investigation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but Dong later appeared before the
public with his official title. That does not necessarily mean, however,
that the rumors are baseless. **[At least one high-ranking commissar,
Qin Shutong, was dismissed from his position, and three others went
absent from meetings]{.underline}** in which they were supposed to
participate, after rumors swirled around them for several months.

The phenomenon is not confined to the military. **[[Purges of
civilians]{.mark} have also been numerous]{.underline}**. Across the
Party-state system, **[at least [58]{.mark} high-ranking [cadres lost
their positions]{.mark} in the first three quarters of 2024 and
[642,000]{.mark} cadres at various levels [were
punished]{.mark}]{.underline}** over the same time period, according
to official statistics. **[Among 205 full members of the 20th Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), at least eight were
purged]{.underline}** (including one who committed ~~suicide~~ in office
after reportedly being investigated by the Commission for Discipline
Inspection, which carries out the Party's anti-corruption campaigns);
eight seemed to be in trouble given their prolonged, unexplained absence
from important meetings among other signals; and three were sidelined.
In all, those affected comprise 9.3 percent of the members of China's
most powerful body of political authority only a little more than two
years since it was reconstituted.

The beginning of Xi Jinping's third term leading China at the 20th Party
Congress in October 2022 was widely viewed as a milestone in his
**[extraordinary consolidation of power]{.underline}**. Among the main
indications of how firm his grip had become was his successful
reorganization of Party-state leadership with his loyalists installed in
prominent positions. And yet, the purges continue. Why? **[Why would Xi
[purge men]{.mark} he has [personally chosen to lead]{.mark} the
country?]{.underline}** What can the purges tell us about the current
state of China's politics and governance? To understand better why Xi
governs the way he does, it's illuminating to examine the ways that his
methods of exercising power, in particular his penchant for purges of
handpicked allies, mirror those of his communist forebears. When Xi's
actions are viewed through the **[lens of what might be termed "Stalin
Logic,"]{.underline}** they become both less paradoxical and easier to
predict.

**[Xi Jinping's [third term]{.mark} has [not resulted in élite
solidarity]{.mark} or the ebb of purges]{.underline}**. Instead, it has
**[occasioned [unceasing political storms]{.mark} sweeping across the
country and, especially, the Party-state-military system, resulting in
the [fall from power]{.mark} of several [newly promoted]{.mark}
high-ranking [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Most prominent among them
are **[[Foreign Minister]{.mark} Qin Gang, the]{.underline}** youngest
among the national leadership anointed at the March 2023 session of the
NPC, **[who was removed from office in July 2023]{.underline}**, and
**[Defense Minister Li Shangfu]{.underline}**, promoted at that same NPC
session but investigated in August 2023, dismissed from office in
October 2023, and **[then expelled from the CCP in June
2024]{.underline}**, despite his **[close relationship to [PLA
leader]{.mark} Zhang Youxia]{.underline}**, who is **[second only in
military power to Xi]{.underline}** himself, and despite being a member
of the so-called "**[red second generation]{.underline}**" of offspring
of Party elders. What happened with Qin and Li remains mysterious, even
though more than a year has now passed since their sudden descent from
the firmament of rising CCP stars into Xi's dungeon.

Additionally, in December 2023, **[China officially [revoked the
positions of]{.mark} nine deputies to the NPC, [all former PLA
generals]{.mark} with positions spread across equipment and weapons
development, the [military-industrial sector]{.mark}, the Air Force, the
Ground Force, and the Navy]{.underline}**. Especially hard hit was the
headquarters of the **[[PLA Rocket Force]{.mark}, which saw the [arrests
o]{.mark}f its [commander, deputy commanders]{.mark}, and a former
commander]{.underline}**. Also in December 2023, the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), announced the **[[revocation
of memberships]{.mark} of leading officials including prominent figures
from the military-industrial sector]{.underline}**, which is owned and
managed by the Party-state. Other high-ranking cadres in serious trouble
include: Jiang Chaoliang, former party secretary of Hubei province, who
was investigated in February 2025; Jin Zhuanglong, Minister of Industry
and Information Technology, who has been absent from important meetings
since the end of 2024; **[Luo Zengbin, [party secretary of
Haikou]{.mark} city]{.underline}**, who was investigated in December
2024; Wu Cunrong, a **[full-provincial-level cadre of
Shanxi]{.underline}**, who was investigated in mid-December 2024; **[Wu
Yingjie, former party [secretary of Tibet]{.mark}, who was expelled from
the CCP]{.underline}** in December 2024; **[Yu Jianhua,
[Director]{.mark} General [of Customs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, who
reportedly committed ~~suicide~~ in mid-December 2024 while under
investigation by the Party's disciplinary organization; Zhang Hongwen,
party secretary of Hefei city, who had been viewed as a leading figure
for post-Xi power succession but who has missed seven important meetings
in a row since mid-December 2024; and Zhu Zhisong, the chief of
Shanghai's Pudong New Area, who had a career in the aerospace sector for
25 years, who was put under investigation for corruption in November
2024.

To be sure, purges have been a feature of Xi's entire tenure. And yet,
**[the most recent bout of investigations and ousters differs from those
that came before in several ways worth pondering]{.underline}**. First,
many of those **[[purged]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the most recent round
**[[were]{.mark} widely viewed as [Xi's protégés]{.mark} because it was
under Xi himself that they were promoted to the significant
positions]{.underline}** from which Xi then ejected them. By contrast,
**[during Xi's first ten years in office, purges primarily targeted
allies of former CCP chiefs and members of non-Xi
factions]{.underline}**. Second, as survivors of the purges of Xi's
first two terms in power, **[they had gained their positions by
replacing predecessors whom Xi had not trusted]{.underline}**.
Especially within the military, this process has occurred several times,
sifting those in power down to those Xi presumably esteemed. Third,
**[those who fell victim to the most recent rounds of purges had only
recently been appointed, and thus likely had just been vetted for their
political backgrounds]{.underline}**, interpersonal relations, and above
all their loyalty to Xi. Fourth, the span of time from their new
appointments to their removals set records for its brevity.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

If all of this seems puzzling, it is far less so when viewed through the
lens of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. Stalin launched his Great Purge in
1936 within the Communist Party, military, and society at large, which
pushed the series of political purges he had carried out since becoming
party chief of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1924 to
a peak and resulted in the arrest, imprisonment, and execution of
millions of people, including political rivals, intellectuals, and
perceived enemies of the state. A prominent feature of Stalin's Great
Purge rested in its continuous, extensive, and ruthless cleaning out of
communist leaders who had closely worked with Stalin. Many of them were
Stalin loyalists who helped purge former comrades before Stalin ordered
their arrests as well. A promotion to a higher-ranking position under
Stalin, therefore, did not mean anything equal to trust from the General
Secretary of the CPSU or political security for an official's career,
but instead a growing danger of being purged the next day. Xi's new wave
of purges, like Stalin's, also started more than a decade after he
assumed power. As was the case for Stalin, Xi's previous ten years had
already seen numerous cadres purged. These were communist élites who
gained positions and power prior to Xi's reign, and they were
accordingly perceived as rivals and threats to Xi's consolidation of
power. Such purges seem easily understandable, but things since then
have gone beyond common sense. Like Stalin's Great Purge, Xi's purge has
been continuous, wave after wave, increasingly victimizing those who had
helped him to purge former enemies. Also in the public security
apparatuses, as in Stalin's KGB, Fu Zhenghua, executive minister of
Public Security, played a significant role during Xi's first term
(2012-17) in purging former Minister of Public Security Zhou Yongkang
and his people, but Fu was then purged in 2021. A similar case is Sun
Lijun, who was purged in 2020 after serving as chief of staff to the new
Minister of Public Security Meng Jianzhu, who succeeded Zhou Yongkang
and executed the purge of Zhou. Connecting Stalin and Xi is Mao Zedong,
who also fought against enemies within the CCP for years, then,
beginning around the founding of the PRC in 1949, turned to targeting
former allies who had helped him gain supreme power, and during the
Cultural Revolution (1966-76), to the comrades closest to him. These
victims included Gao Gang, purged in 1954, Liu Shaoqi in 1966, Lin Biao
in 1971, and Deng Xiaoping, twice in 1966 and 1976, among an extremely
long list. In this pattern, when leaders of the Communist Party first
come to power, they purge political opponents, as Xi Jinping did with
his anti-corruption campaign during his first two terms, and once they
obtain unrivaled power with no restrictions, they turn to purging their
allies and even their protégés. If one purges continuously, like Stalin,
then it's inevitable that sooner or later, the enemies will all be gone
and the targets will have to be one's own cronies. Xi's tactics in doing
so more closely resemble Stalin's than Mao's, in that Mao relied on mass
mobilization while Xi, like Stalin, deploys internal state apparatuses
including the police, state security, and Party organs for discipline
enforcement to topple his targets. We could thus refer to the reasoning
behind a dictator's reliance on state coercion to undertake continuous
purges, and their inevitable progression from targeting internal
opponents to political allies and their own protégés, as the "Stalin-Xi
logic," or, more simply, the Stalin Logic. Purging one's political
opponents and rivals may be relatively straightforward to understand,
but the elimination of allies and even protégés puzzles many observers.
Why the continuous purges? Why not stop when power has been consolidated
and leadership consists entirely of people one has personally chosen and
placed in their positions of leadership? In the Soviet Union, Stalin's
consolidation of power in the early 1930s came with a series of
disasters in governance, particularly in agricultural collectivization
and industrialization. In an effort to increase agricultural
productivity, Stalin had initiated the forced collectivization of
agriculture; peasants were required to give up their individual farms
and join collective farms. The process was fraught with violence,
including the use of armed forces and even bombers to suppress peasants
who resisted collectivization. The consequence was the Great Famine in
various parts of the Soviet Union, including Ukraine, known as the
"breadbasket of Europe," in the early 1930s in which an estimated five
to eight million people died of starvation. The Great Purge followed. In
a similar vein, in the 1950s Mao launched the Great Leap Forward to
accelerate industrialization and establish People's Communes in rural
areas, which also resulted in China's own Great Famine from 1959 to
1961. This man-made famine, the largest in human history, claimed the
lives of tens of millions of Chinese people. Then Mao intensified the
promotion of his personality cult, and eventually launched the Cultural
Revolution, his own version of the Great Purge, which lasted for ten
years until his death in 1976. Is the similarity in this cycle of
governance failures and political purges a coincidence? Or is it somehow
an outgrowth of communist politics? Here are Xi Jinping's contemporary
answers: In the past few years, Xi's policies, from "Zero Covid"
enforced with state violence to the "pandemic tsunami" unleashed by the
sudden ending of lockdowns, caused major humanitarian disasters; his
crackdown on the private sector and wider anti-market economic policies
have exacerbated the slowdown of China's economic growth and directly
and negatively affected the employment, income, and consumption of
hundreds of millions of people. The new wave of purges followed these
calamities. Instances of bad governance and the internal political blame
they frequently occasion form a reinforcing cycle. The effect takes hold
in the political interactions between the consequences of the leader's
concentration of power and the effectiveness of the regime's policies.
When a policy failure, or even an outright disaster, occurs against the
backdrop of a leader's concentration of power, the Great Leader may
justifiably worry that cadres will express discontent in a way that
might diminish his power. Purges address this vulnerability by creating
an atmosphere of fear that silences potential challenges or criticism.
But this atmosphere also disincentivizes communist cadres from taking
initiative in their jobs, which further degrades the quality of
policymaking and increases the likelihood of further missteps and
further crises, and thus more purges. Both Stalin and Mao fell into this
vicious cycle when they reversed their regimes' relative relaxation of
control of the populace, especially in the economic domain. Lenin's "New
Economic Policy" (NEP) in the 1920s put the communist regime in a
temporary tactical retreat from its previous policy, which had brought
the Soviet economy to the point of breakdown. The NEP was introduced to
help the Communist Party maintain its hold on power but, paradoxically,
led to a relaxation of centralization and doctrinaire socialism in a
"compromise with capitalism" aimed at improving the regime's economic
performance. Stalin's reversal of the NEP, however, occurred alongside
his purges of intraparty rivals, culminating in catastrophic outcomes
such as the Great Famine and the Great Purge. Similarly, in China, the
Great Leap Forward led to a widespread famine that temporarily sidelined
Mao Zedong, allowing Liu Shaoqi and others to implement reforms to
revitalize the economy. However, Mao responded with the Cultural
Revolution, dismantling both the "capitalist" economic policies of his
rivals and the intraparty threats to his power and authority. Xi's
concentration of power coincided with the reversal of China's
marketization and global involvement as exemplified in China's dual
circulation policy, which unsurprisingly yielded disastrous consequences
in China's economic performance and overall governance. Although there
have been no obvious signs to indicate Xi's power is being challenged
from within the leadership, as Mao's was, that does not mean Xi is not
anxious about governance, let alone his power and authority. The
implication is that the autocratic leader purges his allies, especially
in the security, military, and police domains, because they are the
instruments of state coercion and the leader needs absolute control over
these sectors, even more so than those government departments that were
more directly involved with the governance catastrophes. Moreover,
purging officials who are ostensibly directly connected to governance
failures could be read as an admission of responsibility on Xi's part.
This explains why Xi did not purge the health minister over Covid or
economic officials over the bad economy, but instead unleashed his
anti-corruption campaigns primarily at the military and the like. The
central concern is power. The targets of purges also provide a ready
supply of scapegoats for the leader's governance problems --- not
individually, but as a political phenomenon. For Stalin, they were
anti-revolutionaries; for Mao, class enemies, including "capitalist
roaders"; for Xi, corrupt cadres whose sabotage causes policy failures
and makes the Great Leader's further consolidation of power necessary
and more desirable for better governance. It is no accident that the
communist leader's concentration of power sits at the center of this
entire cycle. From the perspective of administrative science,
concentration of power is necessary for effective management. In the
cases of Stalin, Mao, and Xi, however, power becomes ultra-concentrated.
The difference here is not only one of degree, but involves deeper
institutional elements. "Institutions" here primarily mean the rules
with which power is gained, distributed, and exercised. To put it
simply, for effective administration, concentration of power must follow
explicit rules, but in conditions of ultra-concentration of power the
leader remakes rules at his will. Communist politics by nature tends to
yield ultra-concentration, which greatly strengthens the leader's
control but inevitably undermines the governance capability of the
regime. The Stalin Logic does not simply arise from the personality
problems of a given communist leader. Rather, its foundations are
institutional. They rely on a quartet of linkages.

**[First is the linkage between "[legitimacy]{.mark}" and
ultra-concentration of power. The communist political system suffers
constantly from a "legitimacy deficit," epitomized by the top [leader's
legitimacy deficit]{.mark}, as the [leader gains power]{.mark} without
open and fair competition]{.underline}**, nor with any constitutional
guarantee that his position will endure even after he has successfully
gained power. Stalin followed this path through the 1920s to the 1930s;
he became General Secretary of the CPSU in 1922, and, after Lenin's
death in 1924, began to continuously purge political opponents and
centralize power in a process that peaked during the Great Purge. Mao
accomplished his power concentration during the years between 1935 and
1945, but, as discussed earlier, he experienced some setbacks in the
early 1960s, which led to his political revenge during the Cultural
Revolution. Xi Jinping moved fast in this regard in his first ten years
in office, so that he achieved a complete triumph of ultra-concentrated
power by the 20th Party Congress held in 2022. **[The legitimacy
deficit, however, [doesn't simply vanish]{.mark} once a leader has
consolidated power, and this is because it is [rooted in the fundamental
power structure]{.mark} of communist politics.]{.underline}**

The second linkage is between ultra-concentration of power and bad
governance, which results in the third-order effects of ensuing
political campaigns to cover for governance crises. For autocratic
leaders, the more personal power is centralized, the more unchecked they
are, and the more willful their decisions are, thus the more
catastrophes their governance produces. Disasters are caused by bad
governance; the more disasters occur in governance, the more the
dictator feels that his power is still insufficient and his status
insecure, so he must further strengthen personal authority and power,
which occasions further political purges. The fourth linkage reveals an
answer to the enigma of how communist dictators like Stalin, Mao, and Xi
can purge their hand-picked élites and nevertheless strengthen their own
power and authority. It must be emphasized that the entire power system
of a communist party provides sufficient and powerful institutional
means for the leader's personal concentration of power to endure even
amid political cleansing. Cults of personality are one such means.
Stalin cultivated a cult of personality, presenting himself as the
embodiment of the Soviet state and the leader of the international
communist movement. CPSU official publications told people that Stalin
"knows all our dreams and thoughts; he will take care of us as long as
he lives." Mao's cult of personality was legendary, growing more extreme
from the 1940s until it reached its zenith during the Cultural
Revolution. Today we are witnessing the rise of the cult of Xi's
personality in China. Governance disasters like those of the Covid-19
pandemic and the economy do not hinder such a rise, but rather prompt
and propel it. Ultra-concentration of power, therefore, makes continuous
purges feasible and, in contrast with its self-defeating in governance,
leads to the dictator's self-strengthening in politics.

During Xi Jinping's third term in power, Chinese politics are exhibiting
a "Stalin logic," featuring continuous purges targeting the great
leader's protégés, a series of disasters in governance, and a further
promotion of the leader's concentration of power and cult of
personality. This is why **[China's post-20th Party Congress
politics]{.underline}** has not been stable, but has instead **[teemed
with zigzags of policy upheavals, surprises in personnel reshuffling,
and a series of paradoxes.]{.underline}** The paradoxes include: Xi's
ultra-concentration of power coinciding with his inability to overcome
economic difficulties; Party-state élites claiming loyalty to Xi while
purges of élites continue with new intensity; and, in the social sphere,
the ever-increasing tightening of social control coinciding with a surge
in the incidence of violent crime. Chief among them is the **[declining
ability of the regime to achieve its public goals even when it is in the
firm control of its leader]{.underline}**. Certainly no single factor
can explain the paradoxes, but Xi's mode of exercising political power
and its institutional foundations unquestionably stand alone among the
most significant.

This does not necessarily imply the unchallengeable endurance of Xi's
power, nor of his regime's longevity. Instead, it **[[reveals the
deep-seated vulnerability of both Xi and his
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Behind the vicious cycle of policy lapses
and purges lies Xi Jinping's incurable insecurity. **[Xi [has made
everybody else within his system his enemy]{.mark} or his potential
enemy, and this makes it [more likely that]{.mark} [animosity,
discontent, and resentment among élites will proliferate]{.mark} as the
negative consequences of bad governance create and increase social
grievances]{.underline}**. At the moment, **[[none of this presents an
immediate threat to Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** or to his regime, but
**[[in the long term it makes their vulnerability
certain.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Xi is [vulnerable]{.underline} now---he's lost [control]{.underline} of the most powerful CCP factions.

**Chang' 25** \[Gordon Chang, Lawyer and Political Analyst, JD @
Cornell, 7-2025, \"The Gordon Chang Report--In China's 'Intriguing
Period,' Xi Jinping Could Be Deposed\", Pacific Research Institute,

yc

[**[Xi Jinping]{.underline}**,]{.mark} often called China's
"all-powerful" leader, has **[[recently lost substantial
influence]{.mark} over the Chinese regime.]{.underline}**

Some analysts even believe that in the next few months Xi will be
formally removed from his three positions: Communist Party general
secretary, chairman of the Party's Central Military Commission, and
president of the Chinese state. Others predict he will be kept on only
as a figurehead.

**[This [moment of infighting in the CCP]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the
Party, could be as consequential as **[[another time of regime
turmoil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[[run-up]{.mark} in the mid-1960s
to [the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
which **[[almost ended Party rule]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In any event,
as veteran China watcher Willy Wo-Lap Lam wrote in June, this is "an
intriguing period."1

There are, for instance, intriguing **[[signs that Xi has lost control
of the most powerful faction]{.mark} in the Party, the [P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy.]{.underline}**

Among other things, **[Xi's [most senior loyalist]{.mark} in uniform
[has disappeared]{.mark} from public view]{.underline}**.2 Gen. He
Weidong, a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and the No.
2-ranked uniformed officer, was last seen in public on March 11, at the
end of the regime's major political event of the year, the so-called Two
Sessions.

Many believe that Xi sacked Gen. He, who was known as Xi's hatchet man.
It's true that Xi, since being named general secretary in November 2012,
has both purged military officers---ostensibly for "corruption"---and
restructured the PLA. Both moves resulted in his taking firm control of
the military.

Therefore, **[people have naturally assumed that Xi, for some reason,
turned on his most important supporter in the military]{.underline}**.
That conclusion, however, appears wrong: **[It is [much more probable
that Xi's adversaries removed Gen. He.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[While [Xi loyalists were being removed]{.mark}]{.underline}** from
public view, **[[PLA Daily]{.mark}, the Chinese military's [main
propaganda organ]{.mark}, ran a series of articles [praising "collective
leadership]{.mark}," a direct and [public rejection of Xi's continual
calls]{.mark} for unity, centralization of control, and complete
obedience to his rule.]{.underline}**

These articles began appearing July 9 of last year and were written by
those aligned with the No. 1-ranked uniformed officer, Central Military
Commission Vice Chairman Gen. Zhang Youxia. **[These articles could not
have appeared if Xi were in complete control of the
military]{.underline}**.3

Moreover, Gen He's disappearance was followed by the disappearance of
another Xi loyalist, Gen. He Hongjun. There are rumors that both
generals were suicided in May at the military's 301 Hospital in
Beijing.4 Yet whether the two generals remain alive, they are clearly
out of the way. Their disappearance, therefore, weakens Xi.

"Gen. He Weidong was instrumental in Xi's purges in the military, so his
disappearance indicates opposition to Xi's rule," Charles Burton of the
Sinopsis think tank noted in comments to me in June.5

The recent **[disappearances follow the sackings of, among others, Gen.
Li Shangfu, a [defense minister]{.mark}]{.underline}**; Gen. Wei Fenghe,
one of Li's predecessors; and perhaps as many as **[[70 in the
Rocket]{.mark} Force, the branch [responsible for]{.mark} the country's
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapons]{.underline}**. Lam, the China watcher, also
points to the **[removals of two other Xi supporters]{.underline}**,
Gen. Miao Hua, **[head of [personnel and ideological
inspection]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and Gen. Lin Xiangyang, **[[commander
of]{.mark} the all-important [Eastern Theater
Command]{.mark}]{.underline}**.6

In short, there is **[substantial corroboration for the rumors of [Xi's
loss of control of the military]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Gen. Zhang
Youxia looks to be in charge. **[Some even believe [Zhang is now the
most powerful figure]{.mark} in China.]{.underline}**

"The military, bruised by Xi Jinping's 'Emperor for Life' purges, has
had enough," Blaine Holt, a retired U.S. Air Force general and now a
close observer of the Chinese military, wrote to me in late June.
"**[[Counter-purges]{.mark} originating from the top general, Zhang
Youxia, [have succeeded in isolating Xi]{.mark}]{.underline}**."7

There are similar rumors suggesting **[Xi now [exercises far less
power]{.mark} in the Party's civilian circles]{.underline}**. "Analysis
of Chinese Communist Party propaganda over the past two months suggests
a significant reduction of Xi Jinping's public leadership role," Burton,
also a former Canadian diplomat stationed in Beijing, told me in late
June. "Following a neartotal disappearance from public view in May,
**[Mr. Xi's subsequent [appearances have been largely ceremonial or in
archival footage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Once, state media showed Xi all
the time, but now **[Xi has clearly been demoted in the
coverage]{.underline}**."8

Burton points to the portrayal in official media of Xi's meetings with
President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, the state-recognized Panchen
Lama, and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon. "All these
appearances have lacked substantive policy focus," he observed.9

"Crucially, the **[customary nightly news footage of Xi directing
Politburo meetings]{.underline}**, with Standing Committee members
taking extensive notes, **[has been absent]{.underline}**," Burton
pointed out. "Instead, **[Premier [Li Qiang]{.mark} and Political
Consultative Conference Chair [Wang Huning]{.mark} are now [shown
chairing policy meetings]{.mark}]{.underline}**."10

Burton points to a **[particularly humiliating June 13 appearance for Xi
at a [symposium]{.mark}]{.underline}** marking the 120th anniversary of
the birth of Chen Yun, a leading Party figure who died in 1995. "In his
speech, **[Xi was compelled to praise 'collective
leadership']{.underline}** and Chen, who advocated a prudent style of
governance quite different from Xi's," Burton states. "The state media
broadcast **[[ended without showing any applause]{.mark} for
Xi]{.underline}**."11

Burton noted that the last significant coverage of Xi in state media
occurred around April 25.12 "Yes, state media reported that Xi chaired a
Politburo study session on the 'eight-point rules' aimed at instilling
discipline on Party members," the Sinopsis scholar told me. "This,
however, was a pro forma event timed to coincide with the Communist
Party's anniversary celebrations. **[The publicity was as lowkey as it
could have been]{.underline}** and by no means suggests that Xi has
restored his one-man dominance over the regime."13

The **[[two-week absence of]{.mark} Chinese [President Xi
Jinping]{.mark} from public view]{.underline}** has sparked speculation,
including **[[concerns about a possible power struggle, social unrest,
and his health]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Notably, the ruling
**[[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty (CCP) [did not
hold its monthly Politburo meeting in May,]{.mark} and [no official
announcement about it was made]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This sparked
strong rumors about Xi's eroding power, internal rivalry and growing
dissent. However, loyalists and political observers in Beijing argue
that Xi's hold on power remained firm.

Citing top-level officials in Beijing, veteran US-based political
commentator Cai Shenkun said **[[Xi was under pressure from the CCP
leaders]{.mark} to resign from all party, government and military
posts]{.underline}**. Cai shared an **[[open letter written in
December]{.mark} 2024 by [high-ranking officials to
Xi]{.mark}]{.underline}**, wherein 28 errors committed by the latter
were listed. The **[letter [accused Xi of misguided government and
economic policies]{.mark}, wastage of public resources, political
violations, and power overreach, among others. [Calling Xi no longer fit
to lead the country]{.mark}, these [officials demanded his
resignation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and sought to abandon the current
dictatorship-prone system.

Yuan Hongbing, a former law professor at Peking University, and Yao
Cheng, a former lieutenant colonel in the CCP's navy, both in exile,
echoed similar views. They said the opponents were joining hands to
ensure Xi does not get another term, leaving him with no option but to
leave. "He will step down as general secretary of the CCP and chairman
of the Central Military Commission, retaining only the ceremonial title
of China's chairman, before fully retiring at the 21st National
Congress," Yao said.

Xi started losing his control over the power in April 2024, and there is
uncertainty about the future direction, said Jenifer Zeng, a member of
the International Press Association. And Xi's recent absence from public
view has only emboldened the persistent rumors of a power struggle.
"This absence, coupled with unusual developments in the CCP, echoes
historical patterns of leadership transitions in China. The CCP's
operations have also shown alarming irregularities. The Political
Bureau, which typically meets monthly, failed to convene in late May
2025. That was despite rumors of an earlier meeting to oust Xi," Zeng
said.

**[Cai Qi, a [Xi loyalist]{.mark} and the first-ranking member of the
CCP's Politburo, was [sent to the less important]{.mark} United Front
[Work Department]{.mark}, which was seen as [a dilution of Xi's
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The speculation became stronger after Qi
was replaced by Shi Taifeng, a close associate of former leaders Hu
Jintao and Li Keqiang. Since then, some of the **[Xi loyalists have been
transferred or shunted.]{.underline}** Interestingly, **[[CCP-run news
outlets]{.mark} such as People's Daily and Xinhua have been
[highlighting the governance principles of former President
Hu]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Earlier in June 2024, **[[People's Daily omitted Xi-related news]{.mark}
for three consecutive days]{.underline}** even **[as [it appealed for
collective leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which was in **[contrast
with Xi's extreme consolidation of power.]{.underline}**

**[China's [growing unemployment and declining wages]{.mark} are
politically sensitive issues with the potential [to weaken social
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "Unemployed individuals are seen as
having less to lose from protesting and so pose a greater risk," said
Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

**[[Xi is blamed for the increasing incidences of violent social
protests]{.mark} in China as he has preferred crackdowns, surveillance
and suppression to deal with people's frustration at failures to improve
employment opportunities]{.underline}**. Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a Senior
Fellow at the Washington DC-based Jamestown Foundation, said Xi was set
to lose the political capital needed to advance his agenda.

"**[Xi Jinping is in political trouble. The supreme leader of the
[P]{.mark}eople's [R]{.mark}epublic of [C]{.mark}hina [faces challenges
from multiple groups]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including from retired
politburo standing committee members, fellow princelings, some of the
military top brass, and even from some in the country's middle class,"
he said.

#### Xi [unstable]{.underline} now---societally and politically.

Executive Summary:

**[[Xi Jinping faces challenges to his authority from four main groups:
retired party elders]{.mark} such as Li Ruihuan and Wen Jiabao;
[princelings]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially those based overseas;
**[[military leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as Zhang Youxia; and
parts of the **[[middle and entrepreneurial
classes]{.underline}]{.mark}** who are voicing their discontent.

Xi is unlikely to be overthrown or face a coup, but **[his ability to
force through his agenda may be reduced.]{.underline}**

Indicators that **[Xi [is embattled include his absence]{.mark} from
chairing two recent high-level meetings, [references to "collective
leadership" the PLA Daily]{.mark}]{.underline}** newspaper, and **[[an
adjustment to PRC diplomacy to a more conciliatory
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially toward the United States.

This apparent reduction in power could be a result of the country's
bleak economic situation, which Xi's policies from last year have not
resolved.

**[Xi Jinping is [in political trouble]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
supreme leader of the People's Republic of China (PRC) **[[faces
challenges from multiple groups]{.mark}, including from [retired
politburo standing committee members]{.mark}, fellow princelings, some
of [the military top brass]{.mark}, and even from some in the country's
middle class]{.underline}**. As a result, his ability to shape policy in
the financial, foreign affairs, and other arenas has been truncated. It
might be far-fetched to speculate that Xi, the so-called "eternal core
of the Party (永远党的核心)," might be driven out of office this year,
but it is crucial to understand who his enemies are and how they
challenge the commander-in-chief.

**[The [PLA Daily]{.mark}, the official newspaper of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA), recently have [championed the virtues of
"collective leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}** (集体领导)." This could be
interpreted as a **[[slap in the face of Xi's insistence]{.mark} since
he came to power in 2012 on the dictum [that all decisions should "rely
on a single voice of authority]{.mark}]{.underline}** (定于一尊)" (PLA
Daily, December 9, 2024; Radio Free Asia, December 18, 2024).

**[Xi's [clout over economic decision-making]{.mark} appears to have
been [reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The Central Financial and
Economic Affairs Commission and the Central Comprehensively Deepening
Reforms Commission, which are the two major high-level party platforms
for promulgating economic and financial policies that Xi leads, have
ceased to meet regularly (Fitch Ratings, December 16, 2024; State
Council, January 5; (Radio Free Asia, January 10). This could be due to
the underwhelming results of the massive program of monetary and fiscal
quantitative easing---known to Chinese officials as "using ample water
to undertake massive irrigation (大水漫灌)"---that has been executed
since September (China Brief, October 11, 2024).

The **[PRC also seems to be enacting a [temporary adjustment to its
foreign policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Faced with lackadaisical
prospects for exports as well as the coordinated withdrawal from the PRC
of multinationals based in the United States and its allies, **[Xi has
been [forced to jettison the typically abrasive brand of "wolf warrior"
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, instead emphasizing eagerness to
improve relations with Washington and the West (VOA Chinese, November
17, 2024; CCTV, January 4; CGTN, January 11). This shift is underlined
by rumors that Xi intends to send a senior official to the inauguration
of U.S. President Donald Trump on January 20 (World Journal, January
11).

Xi Face Four Challengers

Retired Politburo Standing Committee Members

Xi has imposed heavy restrictions on the activities and movements of
party elders since his first day in office. These former party
heavyweights, often retired members of the Politburo Standing Committee,
include supporters of the market-oriented policies of Deng Xiaoping, key
economic officials under former premiers Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao, and
former top government advisors such as Li Ruihuan (李瑞环). Security
staff reporting to Xi Jinping's office have changed the personnel who
work for these men, such as their secretaries and drivers, and
disallowed them from holding meetings or travelling to other parts of
country without the approval of the supreme leader (Radio Free Asia,
January 10).

Behind closed doors, **[many of these [elders have expressed disapproval
of Xi's handling of economic issues]{.mark} and [relations with the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** since the third plenary
session of the 20th CCP Central Committee last July (China Brief, July
23; July 26). At a banquet on the eve of the country's National Day on
October 1, 2024, Wen Jiabao and Li Ruihuan sat on either side of Xi
(Lianhe Zaobao, September 30, 2024). This was regarded as a subtle
signal by Xi that he was receptive to advice or warnings from former
senior leaders, even if they lack the authority to remove him. Their
barely concealed critique of Xi's policy-making prowess suggests the
supreme leader may be increasingly at odds with parts of the CCP's top
echelon (Vision Times, August 17, 2024; Nikkei, October 24, 2024).

Princelings

The possession of "red genes (红色基因)" has traditionally been a
prerequisite for accession to top leadership positions (Qiushi, March
13, 2024). Xi, a princeling himself, has spent years attempting to
marginalize those he regards as potential competitors. Such maneuvering
predates his promotion to CCP general secretary, with prominent targets
including as Bo Xilai (薄熙来), whose father Bo Yibo (薄一波) was one of
the so-called "Eight Immortals" (Party elders who held substantial sway
at the end of the 20th Century), and General Liu Yuan (刘源), son of Liu
Shaoqi (刘少奇), the former state president who was at one time
considered a potential successor to Mao.

**[Many [princelings have become Xi's fiercest
critics]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially those based overseas. Many of
these **[individuals grew rich through leveraging their sterling
political and business connections in the PRC,]{.underline}** before
parking billions of dollars of accumulated wealth in North America and
Europe and subsequently exiting the PRC with their families. To ensure
that they are not harassed by their chosen countries of residence, a
number of these former cadres have opted to cooperate with local
intelligence agencies. The information they have provided likely
includes kompromat against Xi Jinping, though it is unclear what this
might include, or how it could be used against him (The Economist, April
4, 2024; Radio Free Asia, January 10).

Military Top Brass

**[Xi's [loss of substantial control]{.mark} over personnel arrangements
[among the PLA top brass]{.mark} became obvious when several high-level
meetings of senior officers were hosted by General Zhang
Youxia]{.underline}** (张又侠), the first-ranked vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission, the top-level body that controls the
military. Xi was absent from those meetings (MND, September 13,
2024; MND, October 22, 2024). A veteran of the military forces'
equipment procurement and missile forces, Zhang was the boss of the two
defense ministers---Generals Li Shangfu (李尚福) and Wei Fenghe
(魏凤和)---that Xi fired in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The recent
investigation of the director of the CMC Political Work Department,
Admiral Miao Hua (苗华), as well as that of around a dozen rising stars
in the PLA Navy, may be a result of **[[Xi's opponents in the
PLA]{.mark} [trying to get rid of his loyalists]{.mark}, including a
number of officers who had [worked with]{.mark} Xi during his [time in
Fujian]{.mark} Province]{.underline}** in 1985--2002 (RFI, November 30,
2024; December 23, 2024).

Zhang is unlikely to seek to overthrow Xi. This is in part because of
the ingrained tradition of the Party's "absolute leadership (绝对领导)"
over the military, and in part because Zhang is due to retire in 2027,
at which point he will be aged 77. The military impact of personnel
issues at the top of the military remains an open question. Some suggest
that it could detract from the perceived ability of the CCP leadership
to take over Taiwan and to assert military domination over the South
China Sea and the Sea of Japan (Taiwan Institute of Chinese Communist
Studies, December 31, 2024; VOAChinese, August 30, 2024). The PLA has
nevertheless made significant gains in recent years in spite of
corruption within its ranks (U.S. DOD, December 2024).

Social Unrest

**[[Social discontent]{.mark} appears to be on the rise in a number of
sectors of society where there [has been a rise in explicitly
anti-Party---and even anti-Xi---activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** These
appear to **[consist largely of victims of Xi's policies, including
those that prioritize state-owned enterprises at the expense of private
capital, those that have led to mass unemployment for graduates from
high-schools and colleges, and those that have created the conditions
for the current economic downturn.]{.underline}** Members of the middle
class who still can get foreign exchange on the black market are voting
with their feet by moving overseas. This is in addition to the tens of
thousands of mainly low-income Chinese who are estimated to have
attempted to flee to the United States via Central America in the past
year. Such a journey is treacherous, involving paying organized crime
groups and traffickers for passage to the U.S. border (Wall Street
Journal, April 16, 2023; VOA Chinese, April 2, 2024; BBC Chinese, April
1, 2024).

**[An emblematic example is the recent [explosion of anti-government
feelings]{.mark} in the city of Pucheng, Shaanxi
Province]{.underline}**. An apparent coverup by authorities following a
case of a student jumping to his death from the dormitory of a local
vocational college led to **[[violent protests by Chinese
citizens]{.mark} expressing growing [intolerance of special privilege
and extreme censorship]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The student, surnamed
Dang, had suffered repeated bullying from classmates. As these
classmates had Party connections, the local police refused to either
open investigations into or provide detailed information about the
incident (CNN, January 11; BBC, January 11). This latest story follows a
series of **[violent attacks by citizens aggrieved by the party and
government late last year that [killed tens of people]{.mark} across the
country]{.underline}**. **[[Retired]{.mark} and decommissioned [soldiers
also regularly confront police]{.mark} or People's Armed Police officers
[with sophisticated weapons]{.mark} and illegally procured fire
arms]{.underline}** (NPR, November 12, 2024; China Brief, December 3,
2024; IHR360.com, January 8). \[1\]

5.2 The China Dream: A New Ideology for a New China?

In the decades following Deng's quasicapitalist reforms and before the
rise of Xi Jinping, **[[many]{.mark} outside observers [considered
ideology to be]{.mark} largely [meaningless as a source of legitimacy in
contemporary]{.mark} China]{.underline}** (Dreyer, 2012; Holbig, 2013,
p. 61; Zeng, 2016b, p. 3). However, **[this stands in marked contrast to
the view from many [Chinese intellectuals]{.mark} who arguably never
stopped and still [widely regard ideology as key to maintaining the
CCP's legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Zeng, 2014). Zeng argues that
this cleavage stems from two misconceptions about ideology in
contemporary China. First, by conceiving of ideology as a belief system
and second that the ideology in question must be based on communism
(Zeng, 2016b, pp. 15, 97).

Instead, Zeng contends that ideology in China should be understood as a
form of discourse (e.g. political language) that includes, but is not
limited to, a belief system." In fact, it was Deng Xiaoping himself who
in reaction to the 1989 protest argued that it was the "biggest mistake"
that reform and opening up had not been accompanied by a political and
ideological education campaign for the Chinese people. Thus, the CCP
adopted a "dual ideological" strategy consisting of a "formal
ideological discourse" that is still steeped in the rhetoric of a
Sinicized Marxism primarily aimed at ensuring party cohesion and an
"informal ideological" discourse aimed at justifying autocratic rule to
the population at large (Zeng, 2016b, pp. 17--18, 22, 129, 149).

However, while the **[[CCP has never stopped employing ideology]{.mark}
as a [source of regime legitimacy]{.mark}, under the leadership of [Xi
Jinping these efforts have taken on an entirely new level of
intensity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In contrast to a formal ideology that
is based on a coherent value system, **[informal ideology depends on
fluid and at times relatively incoherent values]{.underline}**.
Nevertheless, there are three core elements that have remained a
constant of Xi's "informal" ideological strategy, and that have arguably
continued to increase in significance throughout his time in office:
Namely a discourse of (in)stability, **[[Chinese exceptionalism
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** perhaps most significantly
**[[nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Zhao, 2016a, pp. 1168--1169).

As already mentioned there exists a strong almost **[[overriding desire
for stability]{.mark} within Chinese society]{.underline}**. Presumably,
a consequence of the instability of the Mao years as well as a
widespread unwillingness to disrupt a system that has delivered such
impressive economic results in the past. However, while the CCP 17 may
not have created this yearning for stability, the party has done its
utmost to foster and expand it. The means by which it has done so is by
engaging in what Zeng calls "two intertwined discourses" that shape the
language of official statements and the Chinese media landscape: One
discourse on stability and one discourse on instability (Zeng, 2016b,
pp. 122--123). **[The [key elements]{.mark} of the discourse on
stability are [spelt out by a state council white
paper]{.mark}]{.underline}** which argues that due to the unique
characteristics of the Chinese nation such as its large population and
vast territorial size only under "CCP leadership and rule" will China be
able to achieve "modernization" and "development"(Zeng, 2016b, p. 123).

However, this positive narrative that established the necessity of CCP
rule is accompanied and arguably overshadowed by a negative "discourse
of instability" that seeks to delegitimize democracy as a political
alternative. This is accomplished by reframing events outside of China
to equate democracy and chaos. Thus, the rise of populism in the West
and particularly the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote have
been covered extensively to demonstrate that democracy and multiparty
elections lead to ineffective governance and social instability
(Shi-Kupfer et al., 2017, pp. 17, 31). Unquestionably the CCP has been
highly successful in shaping and controlling the narrative on this
issue, resulting in a population that continues to displays high levels
of support for the abstract principles of democracy, but rejects their
practical implementation in China (Miao, 2016, pp. 171--182). Closely
related to this discourse on (in)stability is the propagation of the
idea that China's contemporary political system is derived from its
unique culture and historical traditions. "Traditional values" and
philosophical ideas like Confucianism that the party once sought to
eradicate, are under Xi being revived and actively encouraged. Yet, far
from being just a "bulwark" against, foreign "ideologies and
religions"(Minzner, 2018, pp. 126--129, 138--141), the CCP also employs
an "idealized version" of history to legitimize the present form of the
political system. To pick just one example the party draws for instance
on the supposed meritocracy of the imperial examination system used in
ancient China to justify withholding power from the large majority of
the population (Zeng, 2016b, pp. 142--143).

However, **[the component of the CCP's [ideological legitimation
strategy]{.mark} that has received by far the most attention due to its
[implication for]{.mark} China's [fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy
[is]{.mark} undoubtedly [growing Chinese
nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, that are quite a few
foreign scholars who argue that nationalism has arguably become the
CCP's sole ideological foundation (Holbig and Gilley, 2010, p. 402;
Zeng, 2016b, p. 13). Since 1989 the party has cultivated the 18
historical narrative of a "century of humiliation" which was imposed on
China by foreign powers and that was only brought to an end by the
heroic struggle and sacrifices of the Communist party. Through a
comprehensive "patriotic education campaign" **[this [narrative of
humiliation]{.mark} has become [deeply ingrained into the collective
consciousness]{.mark} of the Chinese people and is central to
contemporary Chinese nationalism]{.underline}** (Wang, 2012, pp.
98--100, 169, 185). This campaign has been particularly successful among
young and highly educated Chinese who otherwise display relatively low
levels of regime support (Wang, 2012, p. 116; Dickson, 2016, p. 231).

Thus, when **[Xi introduced his [grand vision of a "China dream]{.mark}"
his central theme was the [idea of a "national rejuvenation]{.mark}"
that would [restore China to its rightful position of
preeminence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By portraying **[[one-party rule
as]{.mark} the [precondition for the "rejuvenation" of China]{.mark} the
CCP has sought to promote the inseparability of the
party-state]{.underline}** and of the nation as a whole. Accordingly,
any criticism of the CCP becomes an unpatriotic act (Zhao, 2016a, p.
1192). However, while the CCP may have facilitated the rise of Chinese
nationalism, by now it has become a force in its own right. So far, the
CCP has been able to keep a tight leash on spontaneous expressions of
popular nationalism and was even able to employ carefully directed
nationalist outrage to its advantage in its foreign policy (Zhao, 2013,
pp. 10--20).

Yet, **[trying to steer such a volatile force is playing with fire and
[Beijing could easily see itself compelled to escalate tensions in the
S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [or on]{.mark} the
[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** question **[by a [highly emotionally
invested domestic audience]{.mark} against its better
judgment]{.underline}** (Wang, 2012, p. 187). Worse, **[[if the CCP
fails to respond]{.mark} to nationalist demands and [expectations the
anger that is being directed]{.mark} outwards could easily [turn against
the party itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Shi-Kupfer et al., 2017, p.
53). Building upon the work of his predecessors **[[Xi Jinping]{.mark}
has arguably set into motion the most [sustained effort to promote
ideology]{.mark} as a source of [regime legitimacy since
1978]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, the public sphere of acceptable
discussion is becoming increasingly restricted and the harsh punishments
for those that find themselves outside of it risk alienating a
considerable part of the population (ShiKupfer et al., 2017, pp.
32--34).

Given the agential nature of Chinese power, [[XJP must also **establish
its legitimacy**]{.mark} on the international stage while guarding
against external threats]{.underline}. Just as Han Wu Ti's
successful spread of Confucian values and tributary allegiance provided
him an irrefutable source of legitimacy among his people,
[XJP's Zhongguo Meng ("**Chinese Dream**") seeks to **assert** China's
**great power status**, define its role in the international system, and
foster a **[new national identity]{.mark}** under the PRC's Da Guo
flagship]{.underline}. Claiming its place and performing its
responsibilities as a great power is the most fundamental source of
legitimacy and stability, helping to avoid the pitfalls
of power-role seeking seen in Germany during WWI and post-Cold War
Russia. This development does not face Mongol or Japanese external
threats, but rather the U.S.'s geo-ideological neo-containment. 'Geo'
refers to China's complete maritime encirclement in the region,
including the first and second island chains, the Malacca Strait, and
the mini-NATO military alliances of QUAD and AUKUS. 'Ideological' refers
to the democratic composition of U.S.-led state alignments in the
region, as well as the self-reinforcing relationship between
democracies, making it extremely difficult for China to counterbalance
the U.S. unipole in its own waters. Furthermore, the dichotomy between
the West, seen as 'good' and the East as 'bad,' with China embodying the
new Soviet Union, has reinforced the geopolitical divide beyond trade
tariff wars.

Taiwan The Pandora's Box of China's Two-Faced Crisis.

Today, Taiwan serves as the prism through which China's internal and
external developmental challenges converge, allowing external threats to
exploit domestic vulnerabilities and create the very social chaos China
fears.

First, the existence of a prosperous, democratic, and non-authoritarian
China represents a direct denial of the agreement among the Chinese
about the unique Confucian authoritarian model for modernization and
prosperity upon which the CCP is based. As XJP seeks to consolidate
China's political development, the existence of another China erodes
its social contract and performance-based legitimacy. The demonstration
of democracy in Taiwan, alongside its geographical, ethnic, and cultural
proximity, acts as a catalyst for regime change, particularly among the
rising generations and middle class. If we consider Taiwan as already
Chinese, according to XJP's discourse, then Taiwan is already a
democracy within Chinese territory. The U.S. and the West's support of
Taiwan's Democratic Party serves as the pressure point, the gateway
for G.F. Kennan's ideological containment.

[Second, Taiwan [is not only a **threat** to China's **national
identity**]{.mark} but also a challenge to its **sovereignty** and to
those who claim control over it. Taiwan's reunification bears the very
[**condition** of the **CCP's establishment**]{.mark}, born out of the
end of the civil war, [a legitimacy over a unified
China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since China's unification, maintaining Han
territory has been the determining test of a dynasty's legitimacy. It
would be seen as illegitimate for XJP to claim the great power status of
China and invoke nationalism for unity and development if the country is
not physically unified.

Third, [[Taiwan is China's **unsinkable aircraft carrier**]{.mark},
enabling the PLAN to deploy a blue-water navy beyond the continental
shelf, extend its global reach, and achieve the final step
toward hegemony---the control of the oceans]{.underline}. As the world's
first commercial maritime power, the largest trading power, and soon the
world's largest economy, it is crucial for the 'hegemon' to ensure
control and protection of global trade. China is on the brink of
achieving its nationalist dream of rebuilding a prosperous and powerful
nation, and Taiwan is the last obstacle standing in its way. Resolving
the Taiwan dilemma would remove the unbearable strategic ambiguity that
has kept China and East Asia trapped in escalating militarization and
security dilemmas, complicating international relations in the region
since the 21st century.

To what extent can China's Da Guo today compromise power for security,
especially when Taiwan is both a function of power and a source of
insecurity? Rearticulation of the Paradigms.

[The [nationalist paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline} (the Bad), fueled by
XJP, [[echoes dangerously over the **Taiwan** dilemma]{.mark}, as it is
directly [tied to **domestic unity**, stability, and the defense of the
Chinese nation's identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, it is [not an
ideological command that dictates China's foreign policy but rather
[a **tool** **employed** by pragmatic leaders to **maintain domestic
stability**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the face of internal and external
crises. Indeed, [the survivability of [communist authoritarian
regimes]{.mark} has been attributed to their [pragmatic use of
nationalism to rally support]{.mark}, imprint the [**CCP's legitimacy**
onto China's **history**]{.mark}, create [**ad-hoc conditions** for
**unity**]{.mark} in response to shifting threats]{.underline}, and
provide an ideological framework that fulfills non-material needs amid
development. The CCP pragmatically wields nationalism to stoke its
waning legitimacy, reframing past humiliations and current weaknesses as
a collective struggle yet to be overcome. Zhao Suisheng argues that
[[nationalism]{.mark} is [used to "**bolster the faith** of the Chinese
people]{.mark} in a troubled political system and to hold the country
together during its rapid and turbulent transition]{.underline} from a
communist to a post-communist society." This nationalism, "assertive in
form but reactive and defensive in essence," is not an end but a means
of preserving stability. Thus, the intensity of the nationalist paradigm
in political discourse has historically been inversely related to
domestic stability and legitimacy. As XJP navigates China's ongoing
crisis of faith (Jingshen Zhizhu) since 1989, nationalism has reached an
all-time high. Anchoring political legitimacy in ideological nationalism
is a skillful move---easily assimilated by the majority, regardless of
age or political leaning.

Committed to peaceful means, the absolute threat Taiwan poses to
national development is externalized and concentrated in nationalism.
[Through nationalism, [the CCP maintains **social and political
unity**]{.mark} even in the face of the Taiwan crisis]{.underline},
while seeking more stable ways to balance a potentially violent
reunification with fragile domestic stability. Rather than fostering
cohesion and unity through confrontation, as in Jervis's diversionary
war theory, [China **prioritizes** domestic **stability**---[using
**nationalism** to strengthen **unity and loyalty** should it
pursue]{.mark} a Confucian-Mencian [war of]{.mark} self-defense [and
unification]{.mark}]{.underline}. The nationalist buffer has been
observed to be coupled with both soft and hard accommodationist military
strategies, navigating the gray zones of confrontational thresholds.

**[[Domestic instability in]{.mark} China could [prompt more significant
geopolitical disruption]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}**, particularly for
Taiwan. Historically, **[struggling economies and worsening geopolitical
relations in rising great powers are indicators of heightened foreign
aggression]{.underline}**. In China, the **[[suppression of
domestic]{.mark} [dissent]{.mark} could be [complemented by the rallying
of nationalism]{.mark} that [stabilizes public sentiment and distracts
from internal declines]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With **[China also
[establishing its most potent military capability]{.mark}]{.underline}**
so far, some analysts believe that **[[a war over Taiwan is most likely
to take place]{.underline}]{.mark}** this decade.

Notably, **[China could employ gray-zone tactics]{.underline}** that
fall just below the threshold of war, minimizing U.S. involvement. After
President Lai Ching-te visited Hawai'i and Guam in late 2024, the
Taiwanese military observed the largest Chinese naval deployment in
nearly three decades, which included both the People's Liberation Army
Navy and the Coast Guard stationed across the East and South China Seas
and Western Pacific far off the east coast of Taiwan. The expansive
venture shows how **[[China could lock down the First Island
Chain]{.mark}, stretching [from the Philippines to Japan]{.mark}, to cut
Taiwan off from assistance. ]{.underline}**

Given **[Xi's reported unease with China's status quo, [demonstrating
nationalism toward]{.mark} what Chinese popularly [deem a renegade
province]{.mark} could help [redirect public
focus]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the country's economic downturn and
**[[strengthen support around the]{.mark} [C]{.mark}hinese
[C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty. ]{.underline}**

In a deeply flawed economic and political system, it remains to be seen
whether China can overcome economic strife. If not, **[the CCP may
[resort to military adventurism]{.mark}. As China grapples with its
internal challenges and seeks to [divert attention from domestic
turmoil]{.mark}, the [possibility of external aggression]{.mark},
particularly toward Taiwan, [grows more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
If China fails to address the foundational causes of instability at
home, including the CCP's suffocating repression of dissent, the
consequences will be felt far beyond its borders. 

### !---AT: No Taiwan Invasion

#### Yes Taiwan invasion---military [buildup]{.underline} and trump makes China [more]{.underline} aggressive.

**Lin '25** \[Bonny Lin, Director Of The China Power Project and Senior
Adviser At The Center For Strategic And International Studies,
5-15-2025, \"The Risk of War in the Taiwan Strait Is High---and Getting
Higher\", Foreign Affairs,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/risk-war-taiwan-strait-high-and-getting-higher>\]
yc

Tensions in the Taiwan Strait are growing. Even before **[[Taiwan
elected]{.mark} William [Lai]{.mark}]{.underline}** as its president, in
January 2024, [**[China]{.underline}**]{.mark} voiced strong opposition
to him, **[[calling him a "separatist" and an "instigator of
war]{.mark}."]{.underline}** In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its
broadsides: in mid-March, the spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs
Office labeled Lai a "destroyer of cross-Straits peace" and accused him
of pushing Taiwan toward "the perilous brink of war." Two weeks later,
as Beijing launched a large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, the
People's Liberation Army (**[PLA]{.underline}**) **[circulated cartoon
images that portrayed Lai as an insect]{.underline}**. One image
depicted a pair of chopsticks picking the "parasite" Lai out of a
burning Taiwan.

This effort to dehumanize Lai reflects Beijing's deep anxiety about the
trajectory of cross-strait relations, particularly what China views as
Lai's desire to push Taiwan toward independence. Compared with his
predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, Lai has taken a stronger and more defiant
stance in the face of growing Chinese threats to the island, as evident
in his rhetoric and new policy measures. This March, Lai characterized
Beijing as a "hostile foreign force" and announced a plan to implement
17 wide-ranging strategies to defend the island from Chinese
infiltration.\
\
China's vilification of Lai echoes **[[Beijing's
denunciations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, roughly two decades ago, of Chen
Shui-bian, then president of Taiwan. Beijing labeled Chen a "die-hard
separatist" and "a troublemaker" who "is riding near the edge of the
cliff, and there is no sign that he is going to rein in his horse."
Beijing escalated external pressure against Chen and worked with
opposition parties within Taiwan to frustrate his political agenda.
China did come dangerously close to using military force against the
island in 2008 and might have gone through with it if Chen had been more
successful in winning Taiwan's public support for his referendum.

Beijing's attitude now should very much concern Washington. China does
not view Lai's rule as merely a continuation of that of Tsai. Instead,
Beijing sees Lai as a disruptor like Chen and is treating him much in
the same way. Since Lai became president, Beijing has demonstrated
growing willingness to use military might to intimidate and punish the
island. And it is far more prepared to use force against Taiwan today
than it was 20 years ago. Apparent divisions within U.S. President
Donald Trump's administration about how to approach Taiwan compound
these risks. If Beijing doubts U.S. commitments to the island, that
could encourage China to engage in more coercive actions against Taiwan.
All these factors dramatically increase the chances that Beijing will
miscalculate---and that it could very well use force against the island
around 2027, as China approaches critical military modernization
milestones and Taiwan gears up for its next presidential election.
ESCALATION SPIRAL

**[China's official narratives have long [emphasized
that]{.mark}]{.underline}** its peaceful **[[unification with Taiwan is
inevitable]{.mark}. But in recent months, [anxiety has mounted]{.mark}
in Beijing that [Lai intends to systematically decouple Taiwan from
China]{.mark}. Chinese media outlets have [accused Lai of militarizing
Taiwanese society]{.mark}]{.underline}** as Lai prioritized efforts to
increase Taiwan's defensive resilience, reinstated the military court
system to handle espionage and treason by Taiwan military officials, and
accelerated training and preparations for the possibility of a Chinese
invasion of Taiwan. **[Beijing is highly critical of Lai's efforts to
thwart Chinese infiltration and to counter Chinese cognitive warfare,
arguing that Lai is preventing the resumption of tourism, suppressing
and prosecuting pro-Chinese groups and individuals]{.underline}**,
discouraging Taiwanese citizens from applying for Chinese identification
documents, imposing barriers on academic collaboration between
universities in China and Taiwan, and altering Taiwan's textbooks to
undermine historical and cultural affinity.

In March, a Chinese government spokesperson claimed that Lai's 17
strategies were aimed at "obstructing exchanges and cooperation across
the Taiwan Strait." China has also denounced Lai's efforts to encourage
Taiwanese businesses to invest more in democratic countries, including
in the United States. Beijing has cast these measures as doomed to fail
and mocked Taipei when the United States threatened to impose high
tariffs on the island in April. Many Chinese analysts believe that Lai's
political position is weak compared with that of his predecessor, Tsai.
But they worry that this weakness may make Lai bolder, as he might want
to ramp up confrontation with China to try to win public support. Based
on this analysis of Lai and domestic conditions in Taiwan, hawkish
voices within China are urging an ever more aggressive approach toward
Taiwan. Some are calling for the use of military force against the
island or the resurrection of so-called civil war operations,
nonpeaceful ways for Beijing to unify with the island, such as by
imposing a maritime blockade of the island. Other hawks have publicly
wondered whether Beijing can engineer a crisis in Taipei similar to the
1936 Xian incident, in which generals serving under Chiang
Kai-shek---who was leading the government of the Republic of China and
its Nationalist forces---seized Chiang and forced him to ally with the
Chinese Communist Party to fight against Japanese forces that had
invaded northern China. The pace and scale of Chinese military
activities are increasing. A more resonant parallel may be to one of the
most dangerous periods during Chen's tenure. To boost turnout in
Taiwan's March 2008 presidential election, Chen paired that vote with a
popular referendum on whether the island should join the United Nations
under the name Taiwan instead of the Republic of China. This proposal
came perilously close to crossing a redline for Beijing: in 2005,
Beijing had passed the Anti-Secession Law, which established China's
right to use military force against Taiwan under several conditions,
including if "major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China
should occur." When the law was passed, a spokesperson for the Chinese
government suggested that an island-wide referendum could be considered
a major incident. And in 2007, after Chen proposed the referendum,
Chinese President Hu Jintao warned U.S. President George W. Bush that
Beijing interpreted the Taiwan referendum in this way.

**[Beijing [accompanied these warnings with significant military
signaling]{.mark}. China increased its deployment of short-range
ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan sevenfold]{.underline}** from the
beginning of Chen's term in 2000 to early 2008. Before the referendum,
the Bush administration detected that the PLA had put mobile short-range
missile units near the Taiwan Strait on heightened alert. The U.S.
military and intelligence community believed that China could fire
missiles around Taiwan, as it had during the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis---or, worse, China could actually attack the island.

Fortunately, the 2008 crisis passed without bloodshed. Low voter turnout
invalidated Chen's referendum, and the opposition Kuomintang candidate
beat the candidate from Chen's Democratic Progressive Party in the
presidential race. U.S. deployment of significant forces near Taiwan may
also have given Beijing pause. Taking the risk of escalation seriously,
Washington had publicly opposed Chen's referendum and positioned two
aircraft carriers to the northeast and southeast of Taiwan, and a third
near Singapore, ahead of the vote. Nevertheless, the episode suggested
that Beijing was serious about using force if provoked by what it viewed
as "pro-independence" activities. BAD OMENS

Since the 2008 crisis, **[[China's military capabilities have grown
significantly]{.mark}. Its army, navy, and air force have [rapidly
modernized]{.mark}, and its [conventional rocket forces]{.mark} now
field a far more capable array of [longer-range missiles]{.mark},
including [advanced hypersonic]{.mark} and [antiship ballistic
missiles]{.mark}. China has also [doubled the size of its nuclear
arsenal]{.mark} over the past five years]{.underline}**. Beyond advances
in hard capabilities, Chinese President **[Xi [Jinping has launched
sweeping organizational reforms to enable the PLA to conduct more joint
high-tech operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and he has waged
unparalleled anticorruption campaigns to root out obstacles to military
readiness.

**[Beijing's [willingness to use its military is growing]{.mark}, too.
China has long engaged in military exercises to hone its capabilities
and intimidate Taiwan]{.underline}**. During Taiwanese President Ma
Ying-jeou's tenure from 2008 to 2016, Beijing limited these provocations
as it sought to encourage greater cross-Strait engagement. But China
resumed major exercises when Tsai, who emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty
and security, succeeded Ma. In August 2022, toward the end of Tsai's
term, **[[China mounted larger and more provocative drills near Taiwan
than it had ever held before.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Now the [pace and scale of Chinese military activities are
increasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Not even a year into Lai's term,
China has broken precedent by staging three large-scale exercises, which
were given names to raise their profile and distinguish them from
smaller drills.

In a significant shift, the PLA is now using such large-scale military
exercises to punish Lai's administration for domestic political acts.
All of China's past major exercises---in 1995--96, 2022, and 2023---were
launched after Taiwan's leaders traveled to the United States or met
with senior U.S. officials. Last December, China did engage in a
major---but unnamed---drill after Lai made stops in Hawaii and Guam on a
tour of the Pacific. But all three recent large-scale exercises
responded to domestic speeches or statements by Lai. These military
activities have become markedly more provocative, unpredictable, and
complex. In April's exercise, named Strait Thunder-2025A, PLA naval
vessels reportedly ventured within 24 nautical miles of the island's
shores. China is engaging in large-scale operations around Taiwan year
round and increasing activities to the east of Taiwan. In a break with
the past, the PLA now provides little or no advance warning of its
drills. This has raised concerns in Washington and Taipei about how much
lead time the United States and Taiwan might have should China decide to
use force to seize the island. Washington must ensure that China clearly
understands the resolve of the United States. In another shift from
earlier years, recent rounds of exercises have witnessed China's coast
guard joining with the navy to practice blockading Taiwan. China's
maritime militia, a state-backed network of civilian vessels often
deployed to assert Chinese territorial claims, has also become
increasingly involved. The participation of these new actors suggests
that China is preparing to conduct a broad variety of operations, such
as an invasion, a PLA navy--led blockade, and a Chinese coast guard--led
quarantine of Taiwan. Finally, China is also operating across a bigger
geographic range: its exercise in December involved one of the
largest-ever deployments of maritime forces from all three of the PLA's
coastal commands. China conducted operations around Taiwan and in the
East China and South China Seas, demonstrating its ability to dominate
areas within the first island chain---an arc of islands and countries in
the Western Pacific stretching from Japan to parts of Indonesia---and
block external forces from entering to assist Taiwan. Apart from such
major operations, China now conducts near-daily military incursions into
Taiwan's air defense identification zone, a self-declared area that
extends beyond the island's official airspace. In 2024, the Chinese
military flew a record-shattering 3,075 sorties into this zone, an
increase of over 80 percent from 2023. These operations aim to
delegitimize Taiwan's claims to its surrounding air and seas and
complicate Taiwan's ability to monitor and track activities around the
island. Some of these air incursions occur as part of "joint combat
readiness patrols," involving not just air assets but also coordinated
maritime operations. These patrols are now occurring on a near-weekly
basis and offer China opportunities to quickly step up coercion against
Taiwan short of much larger-scale exercises. Days after Lai unveiled his
17 strategies in March, for instance, China launched two joint combat
readiness patrols and then followed up two weeks later by holding its
Strait Thunder-2025A exercise.

WILD CARD

U.S. officials are issuing warnings about these remarkable Chinese
military activities. In February, Samuel Paparo, the head of the U.S.
military's Indo-Pacific Command, asserted that China's "aggressive
maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises. . . .They are
rehearsals."

**[Yet as China increases its military activities against Taiwan, [many
in Beijing don't know where Washington stands]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Beijing is relatively confident that the Trump administration wants to
intensify competition with China, with a particular focus on the
economic relationship. Chinese analysts also generally believe that
Trump will try to use Taiwan as a card in this competition, but there is
no consensus on how he will do so.

**[[Chinese experts assess that Trump and his team are divided on
Taiwan]{.mark}. [Many believe that Trump wants to negotiate deals with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and that **[[he and many of his supporters
want to avoid foreign military entanglements]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But
national security hawks in the administration, such as Secretary of
State Marco Rubio, are still focused on checking Chinese aggression and
influence. Chinese interlocutors note that Trump's national security
team is not receptive to Chinese concerns about Lai, and they worry that
when it comes to day-to-day Taiwan policy, this administration will
likely strengthen relations with Taipei through deepened cooperation and
increased arms sales.

**[These conflicting assessments [leave Beijing less certain that the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will defend Taiwan from large-scale
attacks]{.mark} or lower-intensity scenarios]{.underline}**. But Chinese
officials believe that, if left unchecked, the United States is likely
to move even closer to Taiwan. That creates a dynamic ripe for
miscalculation. **[China]{.underline}** could **[determine that it needs
to treat Taiwan more aggressively to make it clear to Trump's national
security team that it will tolerate neither growing U.S.-Taiwan
ties]{.underline}** nor moves by Taiwan that it sees as provocative.
Meanwhile, China's perception that Trump is not altogether willing to
defend Taiwan may lead Beijing to consider still more escalatory actions
against the island.

IN JUST A few weeks the Trump administration has unleashed a dizzying
number of initiatives and controversies abroad, from imposing tariffs
and cutting America's international aid budgets to starting talks with
Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine and reimposing "maximum pressure"
on Iran. Yet America's biggest long-term challenge remains China and, as
we report, amid the turmoil of America's election campaign in 2024 and
the disruption of Donald Trump's first weeks in office, the **[People's
Republic has been busy strengthening its position.]{.underline}**

Barely noticed, **[[China has pulled off]{.mark} a [diplomatic coup by
turning more of the world against]{.mark} the self-governing island of
[Taiwan. Most countries, including Western ones, recognise China]{.mark}
rather than Taiwan.]{.underline}** Until recently, **[most of them also
either [acknowledged that China claimed sovereignty]{.mark} over
Taiwan]{.underline}**, advocating a peaceful resolution of the dispute,
or took no position on the question. But **[over the [past 18
months]{.mark} a large number of countries in the global south have
signed up to a new diplomatic position. They now [support "all" efforts
by China to unify the island with the
mainland]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**The Economist reckons that **[[70
countries have now endorsed this harder language]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Such a tweak may seem semantic. But it matters because **[[Taiwan is
already a flash-point]{.mark} and the new language offers China
diplomatic protection if it uses for]{.underline}**ce. The Biden
administration made great efforts to renew America's alliances in Asia,
partly to deter a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Even so, the situation
remains delicate. At times Joe Biden appeared to depart from the
intricate American position of "strategic ambiguity". This is aimed at
discouraging China from attacking, but without emboldening Taiwan so
much that it declares independence. Before America's elections, China
held military exercises that simulated a devastating blockade of Taiwan.

Since taking office, Mr **[[Trump has not laid out his policy on
Taiwan]{.mark},]{.underline}** though he has threatened to impose
tariffs on its chipmaking industry. His administration includes China
hawks, such as Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and cheerleaders for
China, such as Elon Musk. On February 7th, after talks between Mr Trump
and Ishiba Shigeru, the Japanese prime minister, the two used tougher
language than usual over Taiwan, saying that they "opposed any attempts
to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion". But at
points in the past **[Mr Trump has [appeared to belittle Taiwan's desire
to withstand Chinese bullying]{.mark}. He may yet be [open to a deal
that sells out Taiwan in return for concessions from
China.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[A [full invasion of the island by China is possible]{.mark}, and Xi
Jinping, China's president, has [asked the P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy [to be ready to go to
war]{.mark}]{.underline}** by 2027. **[Another [option would be a
quarantine, or inspection regime, that seeks to
\[destroy]{.mark}\]]{.underline}** ~~cripple~~ **[[Taiwan's
economy]{.mark} while falling short of an act of war.]{.underline}**

China's diplomatic effort appears to be aimed at minimising the censure
it would face in either scenario. By getting **[[much of the world to
formally legitimise "all" action taken by China]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Mr Xi may hope to **[make it [harder for America to enforce
sanctions]{.mark} against it]{.underline}**. Already, the **[[Western
embargo of Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which lacks UN backing, has
**[[proved impossible to enforce fully]{.mark} around the world. Any
[attempt to impose similar measures on China in a Taiwan crisis may be
even less successful]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Alongside this pre-emptive
lawfare, **[China is [also seeking to increase its
self-sufficiency]{.mark} in everything from semiconductors
to food.]{.underline}**

**[Mr [Trump's return to the White House]{.mark}]{.underline}**, along
with his resentful and transactional America-first worldview, **[[raises
questions about America's commitment]{.mark} to its partners in
Asia]{.underline}**. The diplomatic coup over Taiwan is a reminder that,

**[[China]{.mark} has [ramped up]{.mark} a variety of intimidation
tactics short of armed conflict in the past decade]{.underline}**,
activities commonly **[known as "[gray zone"
coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Its objective, some U.S. analysts

conclude that their best---or even only---option is unification with the
mainland, allowing the PRC to achieve reunification without having to
resort to force.

In 2016, China suspended the authoritative cross-strait communication
channel with the main Taiwan liaison office, restricted tourism to
Taiwan, and pressured international travel corporations to list Taiwan
as a Chinese province. **[Taiwan has reported that mainland [Chinese

2024, **[China [launched]{.mark} a round of [large-scale naval
drills]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [war games]{.mark} near the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}**, which served as a "stern warning" against
"separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces," according to its

nationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and if so, whether this leads to
assertive foreign policy behavior. As [[**Taiwan** remains an **integral
component** of CCP's **ruling legitimacy**]{.mark}, and is thus on the
top of the party's priority]{.underline} list, the question "does
nationalism shape China's foreign policy and make it more assertive,
even aggressive?" matters to China's Taiwan policy, and in turn has
implications for stability in the Taiwan Strait.

While there are many factors that influence China's policy on Taiwan,
[Chinese nationalism has affected its outwards behavior since ancient
times, and [incidents of **Chinese nationalism** driving Beijing to
**act** **aggressively**]{.mark} towards Taiwan despite increasing
cross-Strait economic and social ties have appeared since the
1980s]{.underline}. For example, during what analysts later called the
["**[1996]{.mark}** Taiwan Strait Crisis," the People's Liberation Army
([**PLA**) conducted large-scale military exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}
and fired missiles across the Taiwan Strait as Taiwan prepared for its
first presidential election. In 1999, after former President Lee
Teng-hui announced the "special state-to-state relations" theory,
Beijing put an immediate hold on official contacts with Taipei and
redoubled its military activities in the Taiwan Strait. Following Tsai
Ing-Wen's election as Taiwan's president in 2016, Beijing cut diplomatic
contacts with Taipei and exerted more military pressure on the island.
This essay shows that [[Chinese **nationalism**]{.mark} under Xi Jinping
has taken a different form, and with the party's hardening stance on
Taiwan]{.underline}, the [[likelihood of a more **hawkish policy** on
Taiwan **increases**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although Beijing seems
unlikely to start a major conflict as Trump's return to the White House
brought uncertainties to the world, nationalism under Xi and its
consequences still have negative implications for peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait.

CHINESE NATIONALISM UNDER XI JINPING Chinese nationalism under Xi
Jinping contains both "peaceful" and "assertive" elements. The promotion
and the official adoption and revitalization of Chinese culture were
meant to inspire Chinese national pride and collective unity. However,
the reinforcement of Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, the
ambition to act as a great power (by presenting the Chinese economic
model as an alternative to Western models and being central to global
governance), and the strong promotion of propaganda initiatives,
patriotic education and informational control indicate more assertive
thoughts and actions. In fact, the party has cultivated a form of "state
nationalism" characterized by a strong national agenda, intolerance of
criticism of the CCP, and animosity toward Western values.\[1\]" As it
called on China to abandon the "keep a low profile and bide your time (
韜光養晦tao guang yang hui)" attitude and instead to actively project
and fulfill its ambition, while reinforcing the division between "us"
versus "them," it represents the growing assertiveness of Chinese
nationalism. In recent years, the party leadership has been confronted
with external and internal challenges. Partly due to the downturn of the
real estate market, China has been struggling with continuing economic
slowdowns and weak consumer demand, and analysts are not optimistic
about the country's short-term economic outlook.\[2\] A bleak economic
outlook is tied to rising social instability---youth unemployment, labor
protests, mental illness, suicides, random violence and other signs of
social strains are being seen across the country. As tensions between
the U.S. and China grow, and are seen by Chinese leadership as threat to
its control, the CCP has called for more unity, resulting in a
heightened emphasis on Chinese identity and national sovereignty. It is
expected that rising socio-economic problems and nationalist sentiment
will give the party more incentive to become more outwardly assertive,
even aggressive. CHINA'S POLICY ON TAIWAN BECOMES MORE HAWKISH Beginning
in 2014, the CCP expanded the definition of Taiwan independence and its
definition on the status quo, which meant that Beijing no longer
accepted Taiwan's definitions. Such a change also paved the way for
Beijing's more proactive and aggressive stance to ensure that Taiwan
would not become independent (the stance is also directed towards the
domestic audience).\[3\] Moreover, the unification of Taiwan and China
was put in the context of China's national rejuvenation: the importance
of unifying Taiwan has been elevated, and China should use all its
capabilities and means to achieve this end. This is different from Hu
Jintao's emphasis on peaceful development as the political basis for
achieving unification. In 2019, Xi delivered his first Chinese policy
toward Taiwan, and introduced the "Two Systems, 'Taiwan" solution. While
analysts were divided over whether this solution was different to the
longstanding Chinese stance on Taiwan, in 2022 China released a white
paper titled "The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New
Era," which was seen by analysts as Beijing's more hardline approach to
Taiwan. The 2022 white paper differed from previous policies on
Taiwan.\[4\] First, the 2022 white paper used more explicit language to
emphasize the necessity of using the Chinese military to achieve
unification. Although the use of military force was also mentioned,
previous policies focused more on economic, diplomatic and peaceful
means to achieve unification. Secondly, the 2022 white paper presented
the "One Country, Two Systems" formula as the way for Taiwan to preserve
its social and economic systems, while previous policies presented the
model more as an option for Taiwan. Third, the 2022 white paper took a
stronger tone against Taiwanese independence, blaming Taiwanese
independence activists for potential conflict and labeling them as a
national security threat to China. Previous policies did reject
Taiwanese independence, but the tone was softer and more focused on the
peaceful nature of China's approach. Fourth, the 2022 white paper showed
a stronger stance against foreign interference, stating that any foreign
interference will lead to "serious consequences," while previous
policies did not frame foreign interference as a threat to China's
sovereignty. Lastly, a major departure of this white paper from the
previous two papers issued in 1993 and 2000 is that the promise of not
stationing PLA troops or CCP administrators on Taiwan was omitted. Thus,
the 2022 white paper lays out Beijing's uncompromising stance on Taiwan,
and the language and tone used indicate a tougher, even more
militarized, stance on Taiwan. At the 20th party congress held in
October 2022, Xi made a remark regarding Taiwan: "The wheels of history
are rolling on towards the unification and the rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation. Complete unification of our country must be realized."
This has caused concern among international observers. U.S. Secretary of
State Antony Blinken stated in a discussion at Stanford University on
October 17, 2022, that China has determined that the current situation
is no longer satisfactory and is eager to accelerate its agenda for
"reunification within a significantly shorter timeframe.\[5\]" Also, it
could be gathered from the speech that Xi would not hesitate to use a
hardline approach---just like how Beijing treated Hong Kong---to achieve
unification. Up to Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections in
2024, Beijing increased military activities around the Taiwan Strait,
threatened to impose sanctions, and even openly stated that the
elections were a choice between peace and war.\[6\] It continued to
exert pressure on Taiwan after the elections. On June 2024, the Chinese
authorities unveiled guidelines on imposing criminal punishment on
"diehard Taiwan independence" separatists. According to the guidelines,
China's courts, prosecutors, public and state security bodies should
"severely punish Taiwan independence diehards for splitting the country
and inciting secession crimes in accordance with the law, and resolutely
defend national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.\[7\]" On
October, 2024, four days after President Lai Ching-te's speech on Taiwan
(ROC) National Day, China conducted "Joint Sword-2024B," large-scale
military exercises around Taiwan and outlying islands. China's maritime
law enforcement forces also conducted unprecedented patrols around
Taiwan. And in December, 2024, the PLA conducted the largest military
drills in nearly three decades, deploying around 60 PLA Navy warships
and 30 China Coast Guard vessels in areas ranging from the South China
Sea to Japan's Ryukyu Islands, complementing the 134-plus PLA warplanes
operating in the island's vicinity across a three-day period.\[8\] These
activities reflect CCP's increasingly hardline approach vis-à-vis
Taiwan. THE CHINESE PUBLIC BECOMES MORE HARDLINE ON TAIWAN

In the midst of [[rising nationalist sentiments]{.mark} and the party's
Taiwan policy, the Chinese public are [more inclined to demand a harder
approach]{.mark} vis-à-vis Taiwan.]{.underline} For example, right
before former U.S. Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, many [Chinese
netizens applauded the tough rhetoric from government]{.underline},
military and media personalities who were attempting to thwart the
visit. Some of them made a list of celebrities or influencers who did
not publicly express support for China's position on Pelosi, inviting
social media users to pressure them to make a statement. A former editor
of China's Global Times wrote that China should ["[**shoot down**
**Pelosi's** plane]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[9\]"

Seeing Pelosi visit Taiwan, [many [**netizens** expressed
**disappointment**]{.mark}, commenting that they [were **lied to** by
the gov]{.mark}ernment]{.underline}, and the government did not deserve
people's respect.\[10\]

In January 2024, [[Chinese **nationalists**]{.mark}, who are growing
impatient, called for war in response to the **D**emocratic
**P**rogressive **P**arty's victory in Taiwan's presidential
election]{.underline}. Prominent Chinese social media influencers, such
as one called Midnight Knight, remarked that "[It's better to fight
early than late, and it's better to fight big than small."]{.underline}
Individual Chinese who were interviewed by Voice of America also echoed
this thinking, saying that the victory of Lai could quicken China's pace
of unifying Taiwan by force. \[11\]

Aggressive, hardline opinions on the internet may not be representative
of Chinese people's views of Taiwan, and indeed public opinion polls
shows that only a slim majority ([[**55**%]{.underline}) [of Chinese
respondents **support** Beijing's armed
**reunification**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with Taiwan]{.underline}.\[12\]
Still, netizen opinions could lead to the "tyranny of the minority"---
the [[amplification and misrepresentation of some voices]{.mark} could
[overwhelm more moderated voices]{.mark}, and [increase the pressures
policymakers face.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[Warring States Scenario]{.underline}**: **[[Fragmented Military in a
Criminal State]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In the Warring States scenario, **[[China has devolved into a divided
CCP or post-CCP regime]{.mark} in which personalistic authority matters
more than party institutions]{.underline}**. The country might have
**[[experienced a period of internal civil war or severe
strife]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has resulted in **[[violence among
contending armed factions]{.mark}. The [PLA]{.mark} might have been
[involved in such struggles]{.mark}. Eventually, one leader prevails and
brings the country together. Even so, [peace remains fragile]{.mark},
and the economic situation is dire.]{.underline}**

After the civil conflict, **[a [new state arises]{.mark} that is
[characterized by loose networks among state and criminal authorities.
China has become personalistic, mafia-like state]{.mark} that prizes
personal loyalty above all. The state relies heavily on bribes, payoffs,
a cult of personality, and repression to operate]{.underline}**.
Patronage and corruption have become endemic to the regime and central
to its operations. For the populace, opportunities to advance are even
scarcer.

Paradoxically, the state maintains a strong involvement in international
affairs but mainly of a dark and sordid type. **[[Criminal
networks]{.mark} that [dominate the governing apparatus cultivate
partners in organized crime and insurgent networks]{.mark} around the
world. [Chinese authorities encourage the proliferation of drugs,
weapons, and other illicit goods as a way to earn
income.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Military Performance

Because there are inadequate resources for both the civilian economy and
the military, **[[China's leaders in this scenario direct the PLA to
engage in moneymaking schemes, principally through criminal
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In terms of its operations, the
military is primarily focused on ensuring the autocrat's personal
safety. Secondarily, the military operates in a largely paramilitary
manner to ensure inputs into China's economy, often in conjunction with
Chinese gangs and other violent nonstate partner groups. The military's
missions include rampant illicit economic activity along the Belt and
Road Initiative routes. Being backers of the criminal actors who advance
the state's aims, the military carries out operations to eliminate rival
criminal networks, assassinate political opponents, and intimidate
enemies.

**[[The organization of the PLA]{.mark} [reflect]{.mark}s [the
criminalization of the state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is a
**[household guard of elite troops who pledge loyalty to the supreme
leader]{.underline}**. In return, the state lavishes resources on the
elite troops to ensure they are equipped with the best weapons and
equipment. The special forces who are deployed abroad are especially
favored and enjoy the highest prestige. However, extreme state weakness
would also undermine the authority of the central leader and embolden
rival elites to establish themselves as alternative centers of power.
The result could create divided loyalties and factions within the PLA.

The rank-and-file force has atrophied. Riven by corruption, nepotism,
and starved of resources, many units fall into various states of
disrepair and near irrelevance. Coup proofing becomes a major concern
for the regime; commanders are rotated frequently, and security forces
relentless in their patrols and scrutiny of the military forces.
**[Because the economy is in shambles, leaders direct the [PLA to step
up its involvement in criminal activity, including smuggling, pirated
goods, and the trafficking of illicit goods]{.mark}]{.underline}**

For the U.S. military, the **[[main threat would stem from the
criminalized PLA's support to violent nonstate actors around the
world]{.mark}, including potentially in the Americas]{.underline}**. The
PLA would likely be too weakened by internal dissension and criminal
involvement to mount major combat operations against rival countries.
The leader of China might focus on rooting out domestic opponents and
backing irregular war operations against foreign enemies. The leader
could also direct collaboration with criminal networks worldwide to earn
income and tie down U.S. forces.

#### [Asian]{.underline} crime groups cause [extinction]{.underline}.

**[Similarly, [Asian organized crime]{.mark} groups have
benefited]{.underline}** from the 2008 financial crisis.9 These criminal
organizations **[[engage in a wide range of illegal activities]{.mark},
including drug [traffickin]{.mark}g, arms trafficking, human
trafficking, [smuggling]{.mark} of precious goods, money [laundering,
and cybercrimes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These organized criminals
operate across physical and digital borders, **[employing sophisticated
strategies to implement their [elaborate criminal
schemes]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[47\]. The development of Asian
organized crime in the 2008 economic recession highlights how the crisis
allowed criminal organizations to expand their illicit activities. They
took advantage of the economic instability to engage in money
laundering, tax evasion, and other illegal endeavors. The subsequent
emergence of the drug economy further contributed to the growth of
organized crime.10

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

There are several areas where AOC groups can exploit the vulnerabilities
and insecurities that arise during such a period. Firstly, the 2008
financial crisis enhanced economic vulnerability, allowing for the
expansion of AOC groups internationally. The 2008 financial crisis
resulted in widespread economic stress, job losses, and financial
instability. These conditions made individuals and businesses more
vulnerable to exploitation by organized crime groups. Asian organized
crime groups preyed upon these vulnerable populations by offering
fraudulent job opportunities, engaging in human trafficking, and other
forms of exploitation. They took advantage of people's desperation for
financial stability, luring them into criminal activities or subjecting
them to forced labor. Weakening economies and reduced law enforcement
resources in some regions allowed these groups to establish new networks
and partnerships with criminal organizations in other countries. This
expansion facilitated the diversification of their criminal activities
and increased their overall power and reach. Regarding transnational
activities, AOC groups seized the opportunity to expand their illicit
activities and gain control over various sectors. In money laundering,
during times of economic turmoil, illicit funds become more prevalent as
legitimate financial systems struggle. Asian organized crime groups,
particularly those involved in transnational money laundering networks,
capitalized on this situation. They facilitated the movement of illicit
funds across borders, disguising them as legitimate transactions and
taking advantage of weak regulatory oversight and enforcement. Another
prominent activity is illicit trade and smuggling. The disruption caused
by the financial crisis also created opportunities for Asian criminal
syndicates involved in smuggling and illicit trade. With the increased
demand for cheaper goods and an influx of counterfeit products, these
groups exploited the market by trafficking counterfeit goods,
contraband, and pharmaceuticals. A severe type of crime after 2008 is
cybercrime. The advancement of technology and increased reliance on
digital platforms have provided new avenues for criminal activities.
Asian organized crime groups have embraced cybercrime to defraud
individuals, financial institutions, and businesses. The financial
crisis catalyzed their involvement in sophisticated cyberattacks,
identity theft, and online scams to profit from the vulnerabilities
created by the economic downturn. In short, Asian organized crime is
characterized by its diversity, connectivity, and evolving nature.
Traditional distinctions among criminal groups based on language or
ethnicity are becoming increasingly blurred as major syndicates from
Japan and China establish links with organizations from other regions.
The impact of trade, globalization, and the region's economic growth
influences this trend. While facing challenges in fully understanding
transnational crimes, Vietnam serves as a source, destination, and
transit country for various criminal activities, particularly human
trafficking. The counterfeit pharmaceutical trade remains a serious
concern, posing risks to public health and raising questions about the
effectiveness of intellectual property laws. The demand for drugs, such
as methamphetamine and ecstasy, has contributed to the resurgence of
organized crime in the region. Combating these issues requires continued
research, collaboration among law enforcement agencies, and
comprehensive strategies that address economic disparities and promote
international cooperation. Adopting a multifaceted approach to
effectively address the complex challenges of transnational organized
crime in South and East Asia is crucial. 1.4 Asian Organized Crime and
the "Anglosphere" States The "Anglosphere" states refer to
English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Those countries
share "common dynamics and problems" (\[48\], p. 1011). In referring to
"Anglo-Saxon intelligence," Herman has observed that a certain mentality
exists in Anglo-Saxon approaches in responding to security challenges,
including "the development of a national estimative process" and "the
concept of conducting strategic assessment" (\[49\], 4,24,35). Asian
organized crime groups, including Chinese and Vietnamese organized
crime, have had a notable presence and impact within the "Anglosphere"
states. The shared dynamics and challenges among these Englishspeaking
countries have created an environment in which Asian organized crime has
found opportunities to flourish. One crucial aspect of Asian organized
crime's interaction with the Anglosphere states is its involvement in
drug trafficking within the Anglosphere states. The illicit drug trade
has been a main criminal activity, with these groups utilizing their
networks and connections to smuggle drugs such as heroin,
methamphetamine, and synthetic opioids across international borders. The
demand for illicit drugs within the Anglosphere states presents
lucrative opportunities for these criminal organizations to profit from
the illegal drug market. Additionally, human trafficking has been an
area of concern involving Asian organized crime. Exploiting vulnerable
populations and seeking better opportunities, these criminal networks
facilitate the illegal transportation of individuals across borders,
often leading to forced labor or sexual exploitation. With their
attractive destinations and economic prospects, the Anglosphere states
have become targets for such criminal activities. Money laundering is
another important aspect of Asian organized crime's involvement in the
Anglosphere states. These criminal groups seek to legitimize their
illicitly obtained funds by integrating them into the global financial
system. They launder substantial sums of money through complex networks
of front companies, offshore accounts, and shell corporations, often in
collaboration with local criminal elements and professional
facilitators. Finally, one important aspect of Asian organized crime's
interaction with the Anglosphere states is its involvement in cybercrime
and internet crimes. The rapid advancement of technology has enabled
these criminal groups to employ sophisticated hacking techniques,
phishing scams, and other cyber-enabled fraud schemes. By targeting
individuals, businesses, and financial institutions in the Anglosphere
states, they exploit the increasing reliance on digital platforms and
online transactions, resulting in substantial financial losses and
security breaches. 1.5 Chapter Conclusion The issue of Asian organized
crime has been understudied in the fields of international relations and
security studies. The rapid economic recovery and sustained growth
experienced by Asian countries after the 2008 financial crisis has
facilitated the expansion of underground activities and the
international operations of Asian criminal groups. This book
comprehensively examines transnational crimes and threats associated
with Asian organized crime groups across different regions, focusing on
the responses of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. This book fills gaps in the existing literature by
offering a comparative and interdisciplinary analysis of the development
and impact of Asian organized crime on the Anglosphere countries. It
emphasizes the importance of understanding and implementing targeted
measures to mitigate the harms associated with Asian organized crime and
protect communities from its detrimental effects. Efforts should be made
to address corruption, digital corruption, and the intricate
relationships between law enforcement agencies and criminal groups. By
acknowledging the complexity and interconnectedness of Asian organized
crime, countries can develop effective strategies and policies to combat
this transnational security threat. 2.1 Transnational Organized Crime in
a Global Context 2.1.1 TOC and Globalization Globalization has
contributed substantially to the rise of transnational organized crime
and national borders \[1\]. The phenomenon of transnational organized
crime has garnered special attention in recent decades as criminal
networks have capitalized on the opportunities presented by
globalization. Globalization, characterized by intensified flows of
people, goods, capital, and information across borders, has brought
about profound economic, social, and political transformations. However,
alongside these positive advancements, it has inadvertently provided
fertile ground for the expansion and diversification of transnational
criminal activities. Essentially, globalization facilitates the movement
of legitimate goods, people, and money across the global economy and
provides opportunities to circulate "dirty money," drugs, counterfeit
goods, arms, illegal aliens, and even nuclear materials \[2\]. Scholars
have characterized TOC as the dark side or a side effect of
globalization, acknowledging its major role in facilitating criminal
activities \[3\]. Transnational organized crime possesses distinct
characteristics that set it apart from traditional criminal activities.
These include adaptability, mobility, networked structures,
sophisticated financial operations, corruption of public officials,
exploitation of technology, and the ability to exploit legal loopholes
and weak governance structures. These attributes enable criminal
organizations to thrive in the globalized environment, blurring the
lines between legal and illegal activities and undermining the
effectiveness of traditional law enforcement approaches Undoubtedly,
globalization has transformed the world, facilitating the flow of goods,
information, and people across borders. While globalization has brought
numerous benefits, it has inadvertently empowered transnational
organized crime. As a transformative force, globalization has
facilitated the growth and proliferation of transnational organized
crime. The increased mobility of people and goods, advancements in
transportation and communication technologies, liberalization of trade
and finance, and porous borders have provided criminal networks with
ample opportunities for engaging in illicit operations. Moreover,
globalization has given rise to global networks of production and
consumption, resulting in high demand for illegal goods and services,
further fueling the expansion of transnational criminal activities.

The impact of globalization on illicit markets is evident in several
examples. First, **[the [globalization of trade]{.mark} and commerce has
[created new avenues]{.mark} for criminal organizations to
flourish]{.underline}**. In a world characterized by increasing
inequality, globalization has **[disrupted traditional economic
structures, compelling certain individuals to resort to organized crime
for survival]{.underline}**. Illicit markets have emerged, with criminal
networks exploiting the demand for unlawful services and products \[4\].
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
identifies marketplaces for narcotics in North America and Europe,
weaponry in the Middle East and Africa, animal parts and exotic wildlife
in Asia, and human exploitation across various regions \[4\]. Secondly,
globalization has facilitated money laundering by criminals through the
ease of cross-border financial transactions and increased investments.
**[[Criminals use the growing number]{.mark} of legal cross-border
financial transactions to legitimize their illicit gains]{.underline}**.
A stark example is the case of **["[Blood
Diamonds]{.mark},"]{.underline}** where the illicit trade in diamonds
from conflict zones fueled violent civil wars in West African nations
\[5\]. The profits from such **[illegal activities are laundered through
the global financial system, evading detection and perpetuating criminal
networks]{.underline}** \[6\]. Thirdly, **[the globalized shipping
industry presents major challenges in combating [transnational organized
crime]{.mark}. Criminal networks exploit the sheer volume of containers
transported annually]{.underline}**, making it physically impossible to
inspect each one. This allows them to **[[conceal large volumes of
illicit goods]{.underline}]{.mark}**, exacerbating the problems
associated with drug trafficking, smuggling, and other illegal
activities \[7, 8\]. The speed at which containers must be processed
adds another layer of difficulty in detecting and intercepting illegal
shipments

Finally, globalization has **[created opportunities for the [nexus
between terrorist networks]{.mark} and transnational organized crime.
[Collaborative networks]{.mark} established by criminal organizations
[allow terrorists to recruit and transport resources, agents, and
weapons on a global scale]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This overlap enhances
both groups' operational, logistical, and financial capabilities \[9\].
The involvement of professionals from legitimate economic sectors, such
as notaries, accountants, attorneys, real estate brokers, and bankers,
further blurs the lines between legal and criminal activities.

2.1.2 TOC in the Post-Cold War Era Transnational organized crime has
undergone major transformations and challenges in the post-Cold War era.
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War resulted in
a new global order characterized by heightened interconnectedness,
technological advancements, and geopolitical shifts. These changes have
profoundly influenced the nature and dynamics of transnational organized
crime. A noteworthy development during this period has been the
expansion of transnational criminal networks. The dissolution of the
Soviet Union created power vacuums and weak governance structures in
many regions, providing favorable conditions for the emergence and
proliferation of criminal organizations. Exploiting the lack of
effective law enforcement and corruption in newly independent states,
these criminal networks engaged in a wide range of illicit activities
such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, human trafficking, and money
laundering. The emergence of transnational organized crime in the
post-Cold War era has become a concern for many countries. The era of
globalization has brought about unparalleled openness in trade, finance,
travel, and communication, leading to momentous economic growth.
However, alongside these advancements, non-state actors have seized the
opportunities presented by globalization to pose security threats to
countries. Terrorist groups, insurgencies, and organized crime
organizations are among those exploiting globalization for their illicit
activities. Organized crime, in particular, represents a non-traditional
security threat that jeopardizes national security and has far-reaching
implications for societies. Unlike other illicit non-state actors,
organized crime manifests in various forms and operates through diverse
illicit business models. Its impact can be felt by individuals,
societies, states, and even entire regions \[10\] co. As a result,
non-state actors have gained power and operate outside the confines of
nation-states, leading to the undesirable proliferation of transnational
organized crime. An alarming rise in violent conflicts has accompanied
this growth in transnational organized crime. The number of wars
globally quadrupled from 80 in 2011 to over 160 by 2017, with civil wars
increasingly involving external actors. Foreign interventions played a
role in 40% of all civil wars by 2017, further complicating conflict
dynamics. In recent years, the number of international terrorist attacks
has tripled, and criminal networks involved in drug production,
poaching, and human trafficking have witnessed substantial growth. The
value of these criminal networks exceeded \$1.3 trillion by 2018,
equivalent to 1.5% of global GDP.1 Transnational criminal organizations
have expanded their operations and capitalized on various advantages the
post-Cold War era presented. Factors such as reduced political and
economic barriers, the establishment of fragile democracies, the
downfall of communist regimes, increased international trade, and
advancements in transportation and communication technology have
facilitated their activities. Furthermore, the relaxation of
international border constraints has fostered cooperation among global
organized crime organizations, making it increasingly challenging for
law enforcement agencies to trace illicit gains, identify and dismantle
criminal groups, and gather evidence on criminal leaders \[11\].
Examples of global collaborations among criminal networks illustrate
their ability to share skills, knowledge, market access, costs, and
strengths, leading to substantial revenue growth and the evasion of
local government control. For instance, when law enforcement actions in
Florida restricted the transportation of Colombian cocaine to the United
States via the Caribbean islands, the drug cartel leaders in Colombia
shifted their operations to cooperating with Mexican counterparts.
Additionally, Colombian drug lords supplied methamphetamine to American
dealers, utilizing their ties to organized crime in Europe, the Far
East, and Asia to procure necessary components \[12\]. These
collaborations enable transnational criminal organizations to enhance
the profitability of their operations while evading government control.
2.1.3 Recent Development of TOC Transnational organized crime has
evolved in a multifaceted manner. According to a United Nations report,
Thailand and Bangkok serve as havens for a criminal network engaged in
diverse illicit activities, such as counterfeit goods, drug trafficking,
and human-wildlife trafficking, generating annual revenues estimated in
the tens of billions of dollars. This network's influence extends beyond
Southeast Asia, indicating a large expansion of transnational organized
crime in the region. Furthermore, criminal syndicates have profoundly
impacted the drug trade in South and East Asia, Bangladesh, Australia,
and New Zealand, with the current methamphetamine market alone estimated
to be valued at \$30 billion to \$61 billion annually.2 Globalization
facilitates markets for desired services and commodities and creates
avenues for undesirable activities and individuals. Disrupting and
redirecting these markets leads to policy externalities that affect
independent nations. For instance, when one country criminalizes human
trafficking, neighboring nations anticipate the diversion of trafficking
to their territories, accompanied by related issues such as illegal
migration, violence, fraud, weapons smuggling, and drug trafficking
associated with TOC. In this context, criminalization policies are
inherently contagious, as enforcement actions in one country can
redirect transitional criminal activities elsewhere \[13\]. As the world
becomes increasingly wireless and interconnected, it is natural that
transnational organized crime adapts to the digital age. Advanced
information systems, now easily accessible to coders, hackers,
extortionists, illicit gamblers, and drug dealers, have facilitated this
transition. The emergence of digital currencies has also created a
separate realm outside government regulations.3 Research conducted by
International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) emphasizes that
almost every major criminal sector in Africa is transitioning to
digitization, posing an unprecedented security risk to law enforcement.
African criminal organizations exploit various levels of the internet,
including the deep web, surface web, and black web, to perpetrate
crimes.4 Malware-related issues have become more prevalent, with cyber
fraud costs quadrupling to over USD 6.5 million in an Eastern African
country between 2017 and 2018. Operation Sarraounia, as revealed by
INTERPOL, highlights social media as a medium exploited for migrant
smuggling. This operation rescued 232 human trafficking victims,
including 46 juveniles, with 180 male victims recruited through online
communication promising fraudulent job opportunities. Organized criminal
organizations in Africa, like their counterparts in other regions,
leverage the internet and digital means to facilitate ~~child sexual
exploitation, trade child sexual abuse materials~~, and solicit
victims.6 The dark web, deep web, and the Onion Router (TOR) hidden
services are areas that law enforcement agencies need to familiarize
themselves with. The deep web encompasses parts of the internet not
indexed by popular search engines like Bing or Google, comprising mostly
legal content. Accessing the TOR hidden services and dark web requires
specialized browsers such as TOR, utilizing non-recognizable web
addresses readable only through these browsers. While a regular internet
browser cannot reach a dark web website, a TOR browser enables access by
routing the connection through multiple servers, hiding the user's IP
address. The TOR browser's features, including obscured websites and
user locations, contribute to its appeal for illegal activities.7 For
instance, in December 2020, cyber thieves attacked the European
Medicines Agency, stealing data related to the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19
vaccine. In January 2021, the stolen data, including peer review
information, email screenshots, PowerPoint slides, and PDF documents,
was posted online, causing disruptions to the Covid-19 vaccine rollout
in Europe.

2.2 Transnational Organized Crime as an Unconventional Security Threat

2.2.1 TOC as an **[Unconventional [Threat to]{.mark} National and
[Regional Security]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The concept of unconventional or non-traditional security emerged in the
post-Cold War era, expanding the scope of international relations and
security studies beyond traditional military and economic challenges. It
encompasses various unconventional threats, including terrorism,
organized crime, and pandemics, potentially posing major security risks.
In particular, the convergence of different types of unconventional
security threats can further exacerbate the vulnerabilities of
nation-states across borders. In the twenty-first century, the nexus
between terrorism and organized crime emerged as a focal point in
security studies. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted
how organized crime groups have adapted to the crisis, taking advantage
of stay-at-home policies and conducting transnational crimes in
cyberspace. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic extends beyond its impact
on public health and represents a transnational threat that undermines
the rights of marginalized and vulnerable populations with limited
agency. The Southeast Asian region, like many others, has confronted the
complexities of non-traditional security challenges during this global
health crisis. Throughout the pandemic, disadvantaged communities in
ASEAN nations have encountered many risks that necessitate governmental
intervention. Women and children, in particular, often bear the brunt of
unequal access to essential resources, services, and opportunities
\[14\]. Over the past decades, the security landscape, both regionally
and globally, has been shaped by various transnational challenges. These
include but are not limited to global climate change, environmental
degradation, pandemics, energy security, supply chain security, resource
scarcity, terrorism, and organized crime. These interconnected issues
pose major security concerns that transcend national boundaries \[15\].
Illicit non-state actors, such as transnational criminal organizations,
have become increasingly intertwined with security concerns \[16\], p.
13. Globalization has transformed international politics and security,
creating interconnected states and a more diverse world. Globalization,
coupled with the rapid advancement of Information and Communications
Technology (ICT), has provided non-state actors with greater incentives
and tools to pursue political and financial gains at the expense of
state sovereignty and national security. With reduced barriers to
cross-border activities, instant communication, electronic financial
transactions, and the flow of information in cyberspace, illicit
business operations have become more accessible and flexible.

**[[Organized crime,]{.mark} as exemplified by criminal syndicates
operating across borders and in cyberspace, has gained [unprecedented
capacity and global reach]{.mark}, challenging nation-states on multiple
fronts]{.underline}**. These criminal organizations continue to engage
in traditional forms of transnational crime, such as human trafficking,
drug trafficking, smuggling, and illegal migration, albeit with greater
flexibility and increased difficulty in detection and prevention.
Transnational crimes have become more elusive and complex to combat. As
a result, **[transnational organized crime has emerged as an important
security issue at both national and international levels]{.underline}**.
The "securitization" of transnational organized crime necessitates
heightened attention and comprehensive policy responses within security
studies.

While it remains relevant to differentiate between conventional and
unconventional security, the boundaries between them have become
increasingly blurred. **[The international security environment has
transformed]{.underline}**, creating a scenario in which unconventional
threats can jeopardize the survival of a nation. **[From the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan to organized crime in "mafia
states"]{.underline}**9 and **["weak states,"]{.underline}**10 as well
as the COVID-19 pandemic, unconventional threats can severely impede a
country's stability and security. Organized crime is one of the most
severe unconventional threats to democratic societies \[19\].
**[[Criminals exploit weaknesses within democratic institutions,
destabilize the rule of law, undermine values and norms]{.mark}, distort
economies, and [incite community conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Differences in legal systems and law enforcement capacities across
countries provide organized crime groups with avenues to evade
prosecution. The impact of transnational organized crime extends beyond
national and domestic concerns, becoming a regional and even
international problem. Given the complexity of organized crime in both
the physical and virtual realms, effective countermeasures necessitate
international collaboration among governments.

Transnational organized crime poses a threat to national and regional
security and undermines the rule of law, economic progress, and
political stability while impeding cultural and social development.
**[Transitional [criminals erode a state's political and economic
institutions by fostering corruption and bribing authorities]{.mark} in
law enforcement, customs, immigration, and the judicial
system]{.underline}**. For instance, the support and collaboration of
corrupt individuals within security forces, public services, and
legislatures enable the illicit exploitation of natural resources and
even organized crime. **[Over [time, bribery and corruption erode
citizens' trust in the rule of law and governing
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is a growing concern in
impoverished nations where institutions responsible for combating
transnational and international crimes, including bureaucratic,
political, and law enforcement entities, are weakened \[20, 21\].
Estimating the magnitude of transnational organized crime poses
challenges due to its secretive nature, underreporting, and the lack of
standardized definitions. The United Nations reports annual criminal
profits of bribery.11

Global Financial Integrity emphasizes the profit motive behind
transnational crime. Among various illicit activities, counterfeiting
(\$923 billion to \$1.13 trillion) and drug trafficking (\$426 billion
to \$652 billion) rank as the most lucrative, with illegal logging
leading in natural resource crime (\$52 billion to \$157 billion).
Taking counterfeiting as an example, it is one of the most prevalent
crimes in the international criminal category, encompassing intellectual
property theft and the production of pirated goods. According to
estimates from the UNODC \[22\], China accounts for between two-thirds
and three-quarters of all counterfeit items worldwide.

2.2.2 **[Asian Organized Crime]{.underline}** as an Unconventional
Security Threat to Nation-States

Since the twenty-first century, **[the global criminal landscape has
witnessed the ascendance of AOC]{.underline}**. While nation-states
continue to maintain dominant positions in the international system, it
is evident that **[[the sovereignty of states has been "shared" or
"eroded" by various non-state actors]{.mark}, including terrorist
groups, insurgencies]{.underline}**, multinational corporations, and
non-governmental organizations. As illicit non-state actors primarily
profit-driven, AOC exploits the loopholes in international and state
systems. The processes of globalization, complex interdependence among
states, and technological advancements have facilitated their
development and growth, making them more powerful and diverse than ever
before

Asian Organized Crime exhibits at least three distinctive features in
global politics. First, **[AOC poses a major [challenge to international
governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Within the existing anarchic
international system, where no higher authority exists above
nation-states, state sovereignty is the boundary for international
cooperation. Many transnational threats, including organized crime,
possess domestic origins but exhibit transnational characteristics.
Addressing these issues relies on international and regional agreements
and coordination, given the absence of centralized enforcing power over
state behavior. However, numerous problems and limitations persist
within state cooperation efforts, as not all states can collaborate
effectively. National interests and power competition often dominate
state policy agendas, making international governance more challenging.

**[Second, [AOC has established extensive networks]{.mark} and
operations across multiple Asian countries]{.underline}**. These
criminal networks leverage cultural and historical ties, economic
disparities, and corruption within transitioning and economically
developing countries to expand their influence and evade law enforcement
efforts. They take advantage of weak governance structures, porous
borders, and the complicity of corrupt officials to facilitate their
illicit activities, which include drug trafficking, human trafficking,
extortion, money laundering, and cybercrime.

**[Third, AOC has [embraced technological advancements, particularly in
cybercrime]{.mark}. The digital realm has provided new avenues for
criminal activities]{.underline}**, enabling AOC groups to engage in
identity theft, hacking, online fraud, and other cyberenabled crimes.
The rapid expansion of the internet and the increased reliance on
digital systems during the pandemic have amplified the impact of AOC's
activities in cyberspace. These criminal organizations operate across
national borders, utilizing sophisticated techniques to exploit
vulnerabilities in information systems and financial networks, posing
national and international security challenges.

The concept of an "**[[Asian Criminal Network]{.mark}" refers to a group
of criminal organizations that operate across Asian countries and share
common cultural and historical ties]{.underline}**. These organizations
maintain close ties, cooperating to expand their criminal enterprises.
Considerable discussion has taken place regarding the role of AOC in
states. Many scholars agree that AOC has emerged as a major security
challenge for individual states in Asia and beyond. For example, \[23\]
argues that organized crime groups jeopardize the fundamental elements
of peace, progress, and prosperity necessary for the flourishing of
nation-states \[23\]. These **[[criminal activities disrupt
peace]{.mark} within nation-states and present a [security threat to
their sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The erosion of national
sovereignty is witnessed through the presence of fugitives, terrorists,
and victims of human trafficking associated with organized crime
networks. **[The [impact of these crimes is
severe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, endangering countless lives each year
\[23\].

Introduction and Strategic Rationale

**[Under the radar of multiple responsible bodies in the West, the
[CCP]{.mark} has [architected the world's most aggressive dual-use
pathogen]{.mark} research ecosystem that spans across [nominally
civilian and overt military facilities in China]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
China's Civil-Military Fusion Law guarantees that the PLA can, at any
time, absorb any pathogen research activities within China, including
work China carries out with international involvement. Unlike the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the American alliance structure
(including in the Indo-Pacific), many senior PLA officers and CCP
strategists do not view biological weapons as unconventional platforms.
Rather, there is increasing evidence that they view **[[biological
weapons]{.mark} as a [core component]{.mark} of the PLA's standard order
of battle.]{.underline}**

**[The CCP has combined decades of [massive investment in]{.mark}
domestic [B]{.mark}io[s]{.mark}afety [L]{.mark}evel 3 and
[4]{.mark}]{.underline}** (BSL3/4)22 **[[laboratory capacity]{.mark}
with a [clandestine effort to absorb international]{.mark}, and
specifically Western, expertise and [technical
know-how]{.mark}]{.underline}** in high-risk gainof-function (GoF)23
techniques. This has resulted in a **[pathogen-diversified,
geographically distributed, and increasingly offensively oriented CCP
capability.]{.underline}** The PLA cannot achieve strategic overmatch in
conventional military domains against the American alliance structure
(let alone NATO). However, bioweapons are one defense domain in which
the CCP is likely to see distinct asymmetric advantages it can leverage
strategically against its enemies.

It is essential that the United States has a directly executable set of
options to target the full spectrum of China's dual-use pathogen
research infrastructure if the CCP regime collapses. The CCP is already
beginning to internationalize its networks, especially in Pakistan.
CCP-driven proliferation of bioweapons to other hostile states, criminal
syndicates, and other threat groups can fundamentally and irreversibly
alter global security. Precision targeting is necessary to prevent any
such scenario. This chapter provides a strategic-level overview of the
CCP's key bioweapons research institutes and the specific type of
high-risk pathogen research they are conducting. Based on these
scenarios, it presents three precision targeting mission options
followed by a fundamental execution plan for these missions. It
concludes with a net assessment that argues for the outright
destruction, not restructuring, of these bioweapons facilities. Key
CCP-Run Institutions Wuhan Institute of Virology The Wuhan Institute of
Virology (WIV)24 was established in 1956 as a microbiology laboratory of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and is one of the earliest
national-level research institutes established after the PRC's founding
in 1949.25 In 1961, the microbiology laboratory of CAS was upgraded to
CAS Central South Institute of Microbiology and then renamed CAS Wuhan
Institute of Microbiology in 1962. In 1970, during the Cultural
Revolution, it separated from CAS and was renamed the Hubei Institute of
Microbiology. In June 1978, it returned to the CAS and was named the
Wuhan Institute of Virology of CAS with research disciplines adjusted
accordingly. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
outbreak, the CCP initiated the construction of the BSL4 laboratory
(also referred to as a P4 laboratory in China). The CAS and the local
Wuhan government jointly constructed WIV's BSL4 lab using technology and
equipment from the BSL4 laboratory in Lyon, France. Chinese and French
architects and scientists designed the laboratory together, and Chinese
workers completed its construction and the installation of its main
facilities and equipment. After more than a decade of work, they
completed it in 2015.26 WIV has established itself as a domestic "center
of excellence" working with pathogens ranging from Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS), Zika, SARS, and SARS-like viruses to Nipah,
Ebola, HIV, and various insect-borne viruses, such as malaria. Its
official website lists 65 in-house scholars, including 36 senior, five
junior, and 24 associate research fellows. Among them are 28 senior, one
junior, and six associate research fellows who have educational,
work-related, or academic visiting experience abroad.27 Perhaps the most
well-known researcher at WIV is Dr. Shi Zhengli, a French-trained and
internationally recognized bat coronavirus expert with expertise in
bioengineering and GoF research. Shi and several colleagues (both
domestically and internationally based) have several landmark
publications in leading scientific journals, such as Nature and Archives
of Virology. Her international scientific collaborators include Dr. Wang
Linfa (Duke-- National University of Singapore Graduate School of
Medicine), Dr. Ralph Baric (University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill), Dr. Jonna Mazet (University of California at Davis) and Dr. Peter
Dazsak (EcoHealth Alliance). Shi also works closely with a WIV
colleague, Dr. Zhou Peng. Zhou was previously a postdoctoral fellow
under Wang Linfa at the Duke--NUS Graduate School of Medicine.2 Their
studies used novel methods to enable a bat coronavirus to directly
infect human beings without the need for an intermediate mammalian host.
For example, the 2003 SARS coronavirus might have originated in bats and
then infected humans via another mammal species, possibly pigs or civet
cats. Additional experiments enabled these researchers to make this new
chimera bat coronavirus more transmissible than even the most dangerous
bat coronaviruses found in nature.29 WIV has capabilities across a range
of "wet lab" environments that deal with physical biological materials
as well as "dry lab" environments that use advanced computational
methods, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. This
endto-end capability enables WIV to conduct state-of-the-art experiments
across multiple domains within the field of virology, including bat
coronaviruses.30 WIV previously acknowledged housing a military
management division (MMD). This arrangement generated some concern about
the potential dual-use nature of some of the research scientists were
doing at WIV.31 There are now no direct references to the MMD on the WIV
website, and information regarding previous official US State Department
visits to WIV has been removed as well.32 WIV also has dense connections
with other institutions in Wuhan, such as the Wuhan Institute of
Technology, Wuhan University (specifically the medical school), the
Wuhan University of Science and Technology, and the Wuhan branch of the
Chinese Center for Disease Control (Chinese CDC), which is located
roughly 200 yards from the Huanan Seafood Market. This market is still
the official point of origin of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan according
to the CCP. Harbin Veterinary Research Institute The Harbin Veterinary
Research Institute (HVRI)33 was established in 1948, a year before the
official founding of the PRC.34 Located in Harbin, Heilongjiang
Province, the HVRI is the go-to institute for information about various
animal viruses (known as zoonoses) that may be lethal to livestock
and/or humans. HVRI has internationally recognized expertise in avian
influenza viruses, namely the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, but also studies
swine flu and other influenza viruses that infect other animal
species.35 HVRI is organized under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences (CAAS) and can award doctoral degrees. It became the PRC's
second BSL4 lab in 2018. CAAS is a peak scientific academy in Beijing
responsible for national development of agricultural science and related
areas. Its 566 staff and 76 senior researchers conduct their work under
CCP leadership and report to the State Council. The HVRI is expansive
(about 750,000 square feet) and includes a 16.5 million square foot
laboratory animal breeding farm in suburban Harbin. HVRI is presently
developing a new site that covers nearly 3 million square feet. Given
the scale of this expansion, it is likely to hire more staff.36 One of
the most well-known researchers at the HVRI is Dr. Chen Hualen, a
leading veterinary virologist who worked at the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention from 1999 to 2002. Chen's recent work focuses on
avian influenza viruses. Some of her experiments, especially in
bioengineering avian influenza viruses, have generated controversy.37 A
particularly controversial June 2013 study examined methods to enable
the H5N1 avian influenza virus to develop pandemic potential by picking
up entire genes from H1N1, the highly virulent influenza virus that
caused a global epidemic in 2009. By combining segments of H5N1 and H1N1
viruses in her lab, Chen developed a hybrid that can transmit airborne
between mammals. Such a chimera is not found in nature.38 The Japan
Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases (J-GRID)
brings together top Japanese virologists and other related specialists.
It oversees joint programs in Thailand, Vietnam, Zambia, India,
Indonesia, Philippines, Ghana, Myanmar, and China. The Japanese
universities involved include Osaka University, Nagasaki University,
University of Tokyo, Hokkaido University, Okayama University, Kobe
University, Tohoku University, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and
Niigata University.39 J-GRID lead researchers at the University of Tokyo
are responsible for the Chinese partnerships and have established a
strong relationship with HVRI. The University of Tokyo team is the only
international group that has strong scientific relationships
characterized by jointly run labs at HVRI. Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka is a
member of this leadership team and the chief of the China-Japan joint
research group on avian influenza viruses housed in HVRI.40 Though he is
Japanese, Kawaoka is a key scientist in China's transnational virology
research network. He also has an appointment at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison and longtime scientific partnerships with Dutch
avian influenza GoF specialists Dr. Ron Fouchier at Erasmus University
in Holland and Dr. Chen Hualan at HVRI.41 While Kawaoka's work with his
colleagues at HVRI focused on avian flu viruses, he has diversified to
COVID-19 research too. In a July 2020 study, Kawaoka and his
international team assessed the replicative ability and pathogenesis of
SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Syrian hamsters. They found the isolates
replicated efficiently in the lungs of hamsters and caused severe
pathological lung lesions that shared characteristics with
SARS-CoV-2−infected human lungs. They also found that
SARS-CoV-2−infected hamsters mounted neutralizing antibody responses
that protected them against reinfection. In addition, passive transfer
of convalescent serum to previously uninfected hamsters efficiently
suppressed replication of the virus in the lungs. Kawaoka and his
colleagues claimed their findings prove this "Syrian hamster model"
improves understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and testing of
vaccines and antiviral drugs.42 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and
Peking Union Medical College Presently, the Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (CAMS-PUMC, commonly referred
to as CAMS)43 operates a full-spectrum, nationwide infrastructure of
laboratories, including BSL3/4, hospitals, and educational facilities.
CAMS is under the National Health Commission (NHC), a cabinet-level
executive department of the State Council responsible for formulating
national health policies. CAMS has 19 research institutes, six
hospitals, and eight schools under its umbrella. Its expert team
comprises 24 members from the CAS and Chinese Academy of Engineering
(CAE), 1,073 PhD supervisors, and 1,437 supervisors for master's
students. The CAMS Academic Advisory Committee has six academic
divisions and 219 members, all of whom it advertises as top scientists.
There are 23 national platforms for intramural scientific research,
including six state key laboratories and five national clinical research
centers. Eighty-nine extramural research institutions or units have been
collaborating with other domestic institutions since 2019.44 Within the
field of virology at CAMS, the Institute of Medical Biology
(IMB--Kunming), Institute of Animal Laboratory Sciences (ILAS--
Beijing), Institute of Pathogen Biology (IPB--Beijing) and Christophe
Merieux Lab (CML, a subunit of IPB in Beijing) are significant. ILAS in
particular engages in high-risk pathogen research using animal models,
such as humanized mice, ferrets, and non-human primates, to identify
direct infection pathways to humans. Recent legally obtained email
communications between Dr. James LeDuc at the University of Texas
Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas, and CAMS reveal that IMB
houses a BSL4 lab. This lab appeared to be engaging in joint high-risk
virology research with UTMB that is available to only a select few
Chinese scientists.45 Previously, many analysts assumed China had only
two BSL4 labs, one at WIV and the other at HVRI. The point person
between the UTMB and CAMS is Dr. Shi PeiYong. Shi is a faculty member on
LeDuc's team at UTMB and has conducted research manipulating SARS-CoV-2
spike proteins to make the pathogen more infectious than the variants
that were circulating naturally.46 This likely represented a common
interest with his counterparts in Kunming. Shi has also worked
extensively with the PLA's Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS)
and CAMS on other infectious disease projects that involve the
manipulation of viruses, such as chimeric Zika vaccine development and
Zika GoF studies using mouse models. One of Shi's key collaborators, Qi
Chen, is the director of the virology lab at the Institute of
Microbiology and Epidemiology (AMMS).47 Despite these well-established
links, Chinese regulators abruptly shut the UTMB team out of the BSL4
lab in Kunming that they helped develop.48 Dr. Chao Shan also held dual
appointments at WIV and on LeDuc's team at UTMB. Chao has several joint
publications with Shi and others demonstrating GoF research. In a 2020
PNAS study, Chao, Shi, and colleagues took a pre-epidemic Asian Zika
virus strain (FSS13025, isolated in Cambodia in 2010) and inserted the
V473M substitution. The substituted gene significantly increased
neurovirulence49 in neonatal mice and produced higher viral loads in the
placenta and fetal heads in pregnant mice. This E-V473M mutant strain
was further studied in competition experiments in cynomolgus macaques.
This mutation increased Zika's fitness for viral generation in macaques,
a clear demonstration of GoF based on reverse genetics techniques.50 In
September 2020, He Yuxian from CAMS and a joint team of researchers from
AMMS, Beijing Institute of Lifeomics, and the Institute of Military
Cognition and Brain Sciences (PLA) published a study describing their
use of SARS-CoV-2 serial passaging. The rationale was to improve vaccine
efficacy.51 Serial passaging involves continuously selecting for the
most infectious viral strains, isolating them, then combining and
reinserting them into mice to produce new viral strains that are more
infectious, lethal, and/or drug/vaccine-resistant than SARS-CoV-2
viruses found in nature. The majority of He Yuxian's co-authors on this
study come from overtly PLA-run institutions. In October 2021,
researchers from the CAMS-controlled CML in Beijing developed their own
synthetic SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lab, which they refer to as the
"SARS-CoV-2-GFP replicon." The declared logic was that experimentation
on this synthetic virus would more fully inform treatment options.52
Despite titling their paper "Construction of Non-Infectious SARS-CoV-2
Replicons and Their Application in Drug Evaluation," they note that
their synthetic virus did in fact replicate over the course of their
experiment.53 Notably, none of the most effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
produced globally have been developed through synthetic virus creation,
serial passaging, or any other GoF techniques. Given the rates of
protection that current vaccines provide against the development of
severe disease, there is no clear civilian scientific justification to
develop additional vaccines that protect against artificially enhanced
SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The CAMS/CML study suggests CAMS, AMMS, the
Institute of Military Cognition and Brain Sciences, and the Beijing
Institute of Lifeomics continue to use the GoF methods that WIV was
using54 on bat coronaviruses. CAMS is also conducting GoF research on
MERS. In a study titled "An Animal Model of MERS Produced by Infection
of Rhesus Macaques with MERS Coronavirus," Yao Yanfeng, Bao Linlin, Deng
Wei, and Qin Chuan from CAMS set out to determine whether monkey models
were effective to study the pathogenesis of MERS infections.55 The
research team sourced MERS samples from Dr. Ron Fouchier and used them
to directly infect the lungs of rhesus macaques and observe their
physiological responses. The researchers reported that infected monkeys
showed clinical signs of disease, virus replication, histological
lesions, and neutralized antibody production. They also confirmed that
the monkey model supports viral growth and manifests respiratory and
generalized illness along with tissue pathology. These researchers claim
to have conducted similar experiments on mouse, ferret, and guinea pig
models but decided not to publish the data.56 Dr. Bao Linlin is of
particular interest for this MERS study as well as for her multiple
studies of H7N9 and her other GoF research on avian influenza viruses.
Some of Bao's GoF research is virtually identical to the research by Ron
Fouchier57 in that both have engineered avian influenza (H7N9 and H5N1)
viruses transmissible between ferrets via droplets.58 However, while
some media and scientists criticized Fouchier's research, leading to its
periodic cessation under European Union regulations related to weapons
of mass destruction, Bao's research has continued with no apparent
restrictions. CAMS represents a major component of China's ambition to
become the world's leading virological center of expertise. However, the
international scientific community has not subjected its GoF research to
any meaningful scrutiny regarding potential public health risks versus
benefits. CAMS has successfully absorbed international expertise to
develop and operationalize its own BSL4 lab in Kunming. This lab is now
able to independently conduct high-risk virological research. CAMS is
now a world leader in developing synthetic viruses in the lab, including
SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and engineering dangerous pathogens found in nature.
This marks a major development in that CAMS can engineer a range of
viruses for various applications, even if it is not possible to acquire
sufficient natural samples. Access to samples is no longer a scientific
bottleneck or a source of Western leverage against Chinese institutes
such as CAMS.

Academy of Military Medical Sciences

**[China's [AMMS59]{.mark} has emerged as possibly its most diversified
and domestically self-sufficient [high-risk virology research
institute]{.mark}]{.underline}**. AMMS has developed **[extensive
in-house capabilities]{.underline}**, domestic scientific partnerships
(including with WIV and CAMS), and strategic international partnerships.
Under the radar of many analysts and other responsible bodies, AMMS also
formed and has sustained links with Dr. LeDuc's team at UTMB.60

Interestingly, in 2021, AMMS partnered with Yunnan Walvax Biotechnology
and Suzhou Abogen Biosciences to develop the messenger ribonucleic acid
(mRNA) vaccine ARCoV. Clinical trials have involved participants from
Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces as well as from Mexico, Indonesia, and
Nepal. ARCoV is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials.61 It is noteworthy
that China initially viewed mRNA vaccines with suspicion and the CCP
actively discouraged them. A key PLA figure at AMMS is Major General
Chen Wei (陈薇), a virologist, epidemiologist, and recognized biodefense
and biological antiterrorism specialist. She was born in the small city
of Lanxi in inland Zhejiang. Chen studied at Zhejiang and Tsinghua
before completing a microbiology PhD at AMMS in 1998. The CCP designated
her a part of the Class A talent pool, and she continued to work as a
researcher at AMMS.62 Chen simultaneously joined the PLA and AMMS in
1991 at the age of 25, and some reports claim she was "specially"
recruited. Other reports claim she visited an AMMS laboratory shortly
before graduating from Tsinghua and became inspired by AMMS's mission
and Korean War--era history.63 In September 2021, Canada's Globe and
Mail reported that Chen Wei had collaborated on virus research with Qiu
Xiangguo, a scientist who led the vaccine and antiviral sections of
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, the only
BSL4 lab in the country. Qiu and her husband Chang Keding were fired
from NML in January 2021. Officials also revoked the security clearances
of Qiu and some of her students, and police removed them from the lab in
July 2019.64 Months earlier, Qiu had sent Ebola65 and Henipavirus66
samples to WIV, with the apparent knowledge of NML's leaders. The
Canadian government ordered NML scientists not to discuss Qiu and Chang
with the media and initially sued the House of Commons speaker to
prevent the release of information about the couple's dismissal.67

In **[2021]{.underline}**, researchers from WIV and the **[Chinese
Communist Party [C]{.mark}entral [M]{.mark}ilitary
[C]{.mark}ommission]{.underline}** Joint Logistic Support Force (CCP CMC
JLSF, to which AMMS is subordinate) **[[published a study]{.mark}
describing a [high-risk serial passaging experiment with a SARS-CoV-2
virus]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One of the key scientists involved in this
study was WIV's Shi Zhengli.68 To further investigate the genetic
susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 during serial passage (a clear GoF
technique) on different cells, this team identified nine cell lines
(human, nonhuman primate, and swine) susceptible to the virus. They then
serially passaged these cell lines with increasingly virulent variants
of the virus and monitored them to identify the most transmissible
combinations.69 There is no identifiable civilian biomedical application
for this type of research.

During the course of this serial passaging experiment, the **[[viral
loads]{.mark} of SARS-CoV-2 [increased exponentially]{.mark} along with
increased [transmission fitness]{.mark}; evolutionary adaptations gained
from serial passaging drove the changes. These scientists note that
human]{.underline}** (including lung, liver, colon, larynx, and skin),
monkey (kidney), and swine (testicle) **[tissues were most
susceptible]{.underline}** to SARS-CoV-2. The scientists' key
"discovery" in this 2021 study is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus replicated
most efficiently in human cell lines (which they classified as Huh-7,
Calu-3, and Caco-2 in this paper) and nonhuman primate cells (Vero E6 in
this paper) but less so in swine cells. They present the specific
verification that the Vero E6 cell line is suitable for viral
amplification as a primary "scientific breakthrough.

These researchers also noted their surprise that none of the bat cell
lines they tested supported SARS-CoV-2 replication. This finding appears
to directly conflict with the assertion in the introduction of their
paper that SARS-CoV-2 is natural in origin and entered the human
population via bats.71 Scientists from the University of Hong Kong also
observed this lack of viral replication in a 2020 study that the US CDC
published.72 This lack of SARS-CoV-2 replication in bat cell lines could
also contradict the official CCP position that SARS-CoV-2 and the
subsequent COVID-19 pandemic are the results of a zoonotic spillover
event. How is it possible to reliably determine the SARS-CoV-2
originated from bats in nature when the virus does not actually
replicate in bat cells? Interestingly, this lack of transmissibility in
bat cells is consistent with claims by other leading researchers that
the virus is uniquely adapted to directly infect and transmit among
human cells, not other animal species.73 Qi Chen (director of Institute
of Virology and Microbiology \[IVM\] under the Academy of Military
Medical Science \[AMMS\]) has a well-established track record of
high-risk pathogen research with Chinese counterparts from WIV and CAMS
as well as with international collaborators at UTMB.74 In July 2021, Qi
and colleagues published a study involving deliberate infection of the
olfactory system of humanized mice75 to stimulate rapid viral
replication, massive cell death, and neurological damage.76 There is
also no identifiable civilian biomedical application for this research.
Once scientists have discovered, characterized, and "optimized" this new
human disease pathway, they have laid the foundation for additional
high-risk research focusing specifically on the human brain. As
SARS-CoV-2 infections primarily impact the respiratory system (and the
lungs in particular), this specific study likely has dual-use
applications. A key declared finding of this study is that
SARS-CoV-2-infected humanized mice experienced a damaged olfactory
system, degradation of immune cell function, and impaired olfactory
function. The authors note that these findings have direct implications
for human health. They detected robust viral replication and direct
antiviral responses only in the olfactory systems of the infected
humanized mice and not in other parts of the brain, identifying a new
"efficient" route for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans by using an
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) humanized mouse model.77 Both
Chen Wei and Qi Chen at AMMS have established histories of working with
some of the world's most dangerous pathogens under questionable
biomedical rationales. Qi has more publicly available research, in
particular with Shi Peiyong and Chao Shan from UTMB, focusing on GoF
experiments. Howev- 30 \| HUDSON INSTITUTE er, it is unclear whether
this indicates Qi is indeed more active than Chen or whether much of
Chen's research has remained confidential. Within the AMMS
organizational structure, Chen is clearly a more strategic leader than
Qi. Chen's established links with Qiu Xiangguo (formerly of NML) are
significant, especially in the domain of Henipah/Nipah virus. There has
been no clinical detection of Henipah virus in China, and adequate
diagnostics are already available. As clinical detection of this virus
has occurred only in Malaysia, Singapore, India, and Bangladesh and
features irregular and short-duration outbreaks, there is no viable
market for a vaccine. Even if pharmaceutical companies claimed to have
developed a Henipah/Nipah virus vaccine in China, it would be unlikely
to have a substantial uptake in these countries.78 Given these
epidemiological and market conditions, why would Major General Chen Wei
be sourcing these viral samples from Qiu at NML in Winnipeg?

Another key observation is that **[AMMS continued its [high-risk
research]{.mark} on SARS-CoV-2 even [during the most acute phases
of]{.mark} the global [COVID-19]{.mark} pandemic]{.underline}**.
Researchers have not credibly attributed any of this work, including the
serial passaging experiments, to any new biomedical breakthrough.
**[Much of the high-risk pathogen research at AMMS appears to be done
inhouse]{.underline}** or with only a strict few transnational partners.
As Chen Wei has overtly stated that self-reliance in the virology domain
is her aim, AMMS is likely on the path to a nearly complete domestic
orientation. While analysts have observed a similar trend with other
Chinese virology research institutes, such as WIV, HVRI,79 and CAMS,80
it is more pronounced in the case of AMMS

AMMS carries out high-risk experiments in its own right while also
enabling other nominally civilian institutions in China. Displaced
high-risk research that other institutes, such as WIV, previously
conducted would have "top cover" protection, especially given Major
General Chen Wei's status within the highest levels of the CCP. Note
that the 2021 SARS-CoV-2 GoF serial passaging study also involved Shi
Zhengli from WIV.81 This is unlikely to be purely coincidental given the
amount of global attention WIV now receives. Three Mission Options:
Destruction of the CCP's Bioweapons Program and Capture of Key Personnel
The high-risk pathogen research institutes that have been assessed in
this chapter and their respective BSL3/4 laboratories pose a range of
targeting challenges. Any actions, especially in the cyber domain, that
involve sabotage or physical degradation can further escalate the risks
these laboratories pose. Such actions could even increase the
probability of a pathogen escape event by causing critical
biocontainment equipment malfunctions. Therefore, any targeting
operation would need to involve the entire physical removal of all
bioweapons materials and enabling infrastructure while ensuring it is
not possible, under any circumstances, to regenerate these capabilities
at the site in question. Also, the geographically distributed and
pathogen-diverse nature of the CCP's bioweapons program requires
simultaneous targeting of these facilities. Sequential targeting would
enable the various network nodes to "fail over" to each other and
continue to operate. In addition to the specific institutions identified
in this chapter, Chinese CDC facilities in close proximity in Beijing,
Wuhan, and Kunming should also be within the targeting scope. The
Chinese CDC has complementary capabilities in these locations (as
mentioned earlier, Wuhan CDC has a BSL3 lab roughly 200 yards from the
Huanan Seafood Market), and any US strategy also needs to take this
infrastructure offline. Lastly, the Pakistan Army's Defense Science and
Technology Organization (DESTO) in Rawalpindi may need to be within
scope as there is increasing evidence that WIV has mirrored some
high-risk pathogen research capability at this institution.82 However,
DESTO targeting options will be addressed in future work given the
different set of variables associated with Pakistan.

Mission Option 1 The first mission option involves an initial team of
specialists forcibly entering a bioweapons facility and executing the
primary mission of bioweapons material removal while a second team
remains behind to secure the site and maintain access control. This
operation would require the establishment and robust maintenance of air
superiority in and around the site. **[[Remnants of the CCP]{.mark},
PLA, and/or Ministry of State Security ([MSS]{.mark}) would have an
incentive to physically destroy]{.underline}** these facilities and the
**[evidence]{.underline}** of their bioweapons program **[in the event
of regime collapse. There is also the [potential for malicious pathogen
releases.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

On the ground, the American team would need to control the geography
within at least a one-mile radius of the site in question with active
deterrent and preventative patrols as well as integrated air defense.
Mission Option 1 involves an overt American military presence alongside
special operators and civilian specialists. In addition to the execution
teams, the logistics of bioweapons material transportation, storage, and
destruction is as critical as the initial site entry and physical
removal components. Strategists would need to configure these logistics
capabilities around the specifics of the known high-risk pathogens
on-site (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 viruses). Mission Option 1 can use information
operations to generate perceptions of outbreaks within key CCP
bioweapons facilities to minimize the number of people on site and/or in
the immediate vicinity at specific times. During the most acute phases
of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, both WIV and the HVRI were operating
at severely reduced capacity, and many staff were working from home.
However, staff deemed critical and PLA personnel remained on-site. In
the case of WIV, Major General Chen Wei temporarily took over management
in March 2020 before handing it back to the official leadership.83 Given
this precedent and demonstrated pattern of institutional behavior, it is
likely possible to use targeted information operations to generate
perceptions of an outbreak within the Chinese facilities in question. By
doing so, the US military could minimize the number of staff on-site at
a given time and increase the probability of direct interaction with
strategic personnel who have remained on-site. Mission Option 2 The
second option would not involve an overt American presence on the ground
but would instead focus on physical destruction and, through the
generation of extreme temperatures, the destruction of hazardous
biological materials. The US military can achieve these effects through
conventional air strikes or missile strikes (sea- and/or
ground-launched) or a combination of the two. After-action damage
assessment will be critical to evaluate operational effectiveness and
determine the need for additional follow-up actions. Option 2 would
involve the physical destruction of key CCP bioweapons research
facilities and any additional evidence inside the site in question. To
accomplish Mission Option 2, ordnance would need to generate
temperatures that eviscerate all known high-risk pathogens on site
(i.e., Nipah virus) with at least a 50 percent overshoot ratio in case
bioweapons researchers have further modified them for heat tolerance.
Ordnance would also have bunker-busting capability because some (if not
all) CCP bioweapons facilities may have subterranean structures. Mission
Option 3 A third option would aim to capture key CCP/PLA bioweapons
personnel and eliminate these capabilities through a more controlled
process based on specific knowledge of each site. However, it would
still involve an American presence on the ground (and possibly in the
air) during dismantlement of each site, although this could take less
overt forms. Mission Option 3 would likely be the most challenging but
also has the potential to capture the most intelligence regarding the
CCP's bioweapons program while also obtaining a high degree of
confidence in destruction of the entire program. Aggressive mission
planning could likely begin earlier than Mission Option 2 or 3 as some
of 32 \| HUDSON INSTITUTE those who have intricate knowledge of the
CCP's bioweapons programs reside outside China. Option 3 planning can
involve the sabotage of critical supply chains associated with
bioweapons research via coordination with American and allied
multinationals. While the purely scientific component of China's
high-risk pathogen research apparatus has decoupled from the West, it
remains dependent on key Western multinationals for specialized
laboratory equipment, machines, high-performance analytical software,
and other critical inputs. As the CCP presently lacks any identifiable
remedies for this dependence, there is an executable opportunity to
directly target the key supply chains enabling high-risk pathogen
research within China. Allied forces can execute this task onshore via
the domestic Chinese offices of Western multinationals. Key options
include, but are not limited to, the following: • Enabling remote access
and control of equipment that China's allies have supplied to its
laboratories and other facilities likely engaging in bioweapons
development. • Inserting performance issues into key equipment Chinese
laboratories are likely using in bioweapons development. These
performance issues would not produce nonlinearities or generate risks in
experiments but would prevent researchers from conducting them at the
last minute. • Manipulating software to show completion and results of a
specific experimental or analytical function that has not in fact taken
place. Another component of Mission Option 3 is the establishment of
front companies in Southeast Asian, South Asian, and Middle Eastern
countries to operate as on-shore/in-region high-value distributors of
technologies that WIV, HVRI, CAMS, AMMS, or other Chinese institutions
and/or companies have developed. As most countries in these regions lack
their own advanced biomedical sector, there has been strong growth in
the establishment of local or regional distributors who seek to sell
Chinese diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics, prophylactics,
medicallaboratory equipment, and other related products. Leading
distributors can access the latest research and development (R&D)
pipeline out of China by making up-front bulk purchases. This model
enables Chinese institutions and companies to generate additional
revenue sources and to directly access a range of markets via local
partners who de-risk the environment for them. This ongoing trend
presents an opportunity to establish distribution companies that focus
specifically on next-generation Chinese diagnostics, vaccines, and other
capabilities that would provide a direct line of sight to the leading
bioengineering/GoF research in Chinese institutions and/or companies
with clear applications for mission planning, precision targeting, and
recruitment of CCP bioweapons personnel. The unique selling point of a
high-value distributor is the ability to rapidly identify key emergent
outbreak zones through effective surveillance and to dynamically route
the relevant Chinese products (COVID-19 diagnostics, for example) to the
locations in question. The distributor can accomplish this through
innovative use of its existing COVID-19-specific production facilities
and supply chains. On top of this existing physical infrastructure, the
Chinese institute or company in question will layer key datasets, other
unique scientific assets, and overall expertise and know-how regarding
optimal COVID-19 surveillance strategies and outbreak response
protocols. Fundamentally, a high-value distributor has the ability to
establish a strategic partnership focusing on the development of
next-generation, low-cost, and easy-to-administer COVID-19 diagnostics
that take into account the full range and variation of not only current
but also potential future COVID-19 strains. The United States and its
allies can establish such companies in key countries of interest. A
final component of Mission Option 3 is to facilitate and enable
defections from locations via academic or industry con- ferences in
perceived CCP-neutral countries. There is a widespread view within the
CCP that Beijing is now the generator and distributor of best practices
in the domain of biosecurity, having overcome its previous "junior
partner" status as a consumer of best practices from the West. CCP
information operations have effectively embedded the notion that China
was the "first in, first out" of the COVID-19 pandemic across Southeast
Asia and the Middle East. The United States and its allies can harness
and repurpose these developments to recruit and enable the defections of
leading Chinese scientists occupying various positions across the CCP's
high-risk pathogen research apparatus. Scientists from WIV and elsewhere
have already begun to host conferences in China with digital
international participation to share China's experiences in dealing with
the COVID-19 pandemic. A natural progression of this trend is to host
similar conferences that showcase Chinese "leadership" and focus on
"joint capacity building" in countries that the CCP considers friendly
(or at least neutral). Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Burma, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia could
all serve as sites for these conferences. The United States and its
allies could keep discrete travel arrangements on "hot standby" to bring
Chinese conference participants to a preferred location on immediate
notice. Execution Pathway: Key Government Agencies and Use of
Unconventional Assets Mission Option 1 As Option 1 involves a two-phase,
ground-based forced building entry and occupation focus, US Army Special
Operations Command would take the lead in operational planning and
execution. The initial entry team would need to be a combination of
special forces operators, Army biodefense personnel (hazardous material
management and transportation logistics), specialist civilian personnel
with pathogen-specific expertise, and possibly intelligence community
specialists who can augment the operation. US Army Ranger Chalks would
provide strongpoints to secure and control the immediate geography and
execute deterrent patrols until the entry team has completed their
mission. Following the successful removal of all bioweapon materials and
the destruction of all related infrastructure at the site in question,
the Ranger Chalks who have been on deterrent patrols will shift to
building control and protection, while fresh Ranger Chalks will be
deployed to backfill them and carry out patrols. The experienced Rangers
will transfer their local knowledge and tactical guidance to the newly
deployed Rangers. The combined Ranger element will remain deployed
on-site until leaders make a strategic determination that there is a
zero probability of the specific sites in question undergoing
reconstitution in any way. Mission Option 2 As Option 2 involves
conventional air and/or missile strikes that require the physical
destruction of buildings and potential subterranean structures, the US
Air Force and its fleet of strategic bombers, missiles, and fighter jets
would take the lead in target development and deployment of the type of
heavy ordnance necessary to achieve key mission endpoints. The US Navy
can augment US Air Force operations, specifically through the use of
missile strikes (submarine- and/or surface destroyer-based) to remove
enemy air defense capabilities and/or to provide follow-on strikes after
an Air Force bombing run. Mission Option 2 would require some specialist
involvement from the Army, intelligence community, and/or other civilian
personnel. However, these inputs would focus more narrowly on ensuring
the air and/or missile strikes will eviscerate all biological weapons
materials and permanently destroy the sites in question with zero
probability of reconstitution. There would be no effort to occupy the
ground under Mission Option 2, and the exclusive focus would be on
precision targeting (continuous, if necessary) using US Air Force and
possibly US Navy assets. 34 \| HUDSON INSTITUTE Mission Option 3 Option
3 would involve unconventional and clandestine operations originating
outside China to shape ground conditions in and around CCP bioweapons
facilities. Given this mission focus, the CIA would serve as the lead
with strategic augmentation from the State Department, US Joint Special
Operations Command, US Department of Commerce, and US Department of the
Treasury. The primary focus of Mission Option 3 is to strategically
encircle, steadily degrade, and subsequently assume direct control of
CCP bioweapons sites through asymmetric means. While the US military
would likely be involved in the critical execution phases toward the end
of the process, civilian agencies possess many of the tools, technical
know-how, and export control capabilities to enable the effective
execution of Option 3 alongside the CIA in the initial and middle
phases. However, it is essential that the CIA and US Joint Special
Forces Command closely coordinate activities. Due to its nature, Option
3 could involve rapidly emergent opportunities to take direct action
against a critical node in the network of one or more CCP bioweapons
institutes. This could involve precision targeting a critical supply
chain or facilitating the defection of a scientist from a third
location. Mission Option 3 fundamentally requires the CIA's analytical
and technical units to be in direct synchronization with civilian
agencies such as the Departments of State, Treasury, and Commerce, while
its operational units must also be ready to execute kinetically with US
Joint Special Operations Command. While Mission Option 3 is the most
multidimensional and complex, it is also the option that generates the
highest probability of obtaining the most complete intelligence picture
of the CCP's bioweapons program and ensuring its complete destruction in
the event of a CCP regime collapse. Net Assessment: Destruction Is the
Only Option

**[The [CCP]{.mark} has consistently [developed its bioweapons program
without interruption]{.mark} virtually since the founding of the
PRC]{.underline}**. It has benefited from and absorbed extensive
international technical expertise in GoF, synthetic virus creation, and
other high-risk pathogen research domains. This pattern is in stark
contrast to the former Soviet Union's biological weapons program, which
was much more limited in its range of pathogens, was highly fragmented
and clandestine, and did not benefit from knowledge transfer from the
West. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the **[[CCP has

China's State Capitalist Model: Part Strength, Part Weakness

Yet, that **[[highly centralized model is susceptible to
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Whereas the American economy -- until
very recently -- was highly decentralized, and risk was spread out,
China's economy, while being more decentralized than it was under Mao,
is still far more centralized today than Western economies.

That means when there are economic headwinds afflicting the nation, as
there always are in any country, **[[political stability is
threatened.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[In the case of [China]{.mark}, a country with a large, and [growing,
nuclear weapons capability]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- as well as **[other
forms of [w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction --
[instability is very bad.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

China's current ruler, the autocratic President Xi Jinping, has
taken more power for himself than any Chinese leader since Mao. Under
these conditions, he gets all the credit when things go well.

When they go badly, as they have in China since 2019, Xi gets the blame.
In turn, **[[Xi has had to increase]{.mark} his [political power]{.mark}
even more to prevent himself from being overthrown.]{.underline}**

To distract his people from his own failures, then, **[Xi
is [increasingly belligerent]{.mark} with his neighbors---[especially
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is logical to assume that the
**[[more]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Chinese economy
**[[collapses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[[more likely]{.mark} it is
that [China will risk war with its neighbors.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Beyond that, though, if things get really bad in China for Xi Jinping,
he could be ousted by a rival cadre of CCP leaders.

This could mean a far more competent Chinese Communist leader takes
charge.

Or, as happened at the end of the Qing Dynasty, **[[various factions
could arise following Xi's ouster]{.mark}, basically [creating a
multi-sided civil war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Now, **[[imagine China's
disastrous Warlord Period]{.mark}, but [with nukes and a whole arsenal
of WMDs]{.mark} on the loose.]{.underline}**

That could be more dangerous for the United States than whatever it
faces from the current regime in China.

China's New Warlord Era

**[A [total collapse of China]{.mark} in the near term, even with many
Western firms reducing their exposure to China's economy, would
[also collapse the global economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It would
**[[precipitate the largest global recession]{.mark}---possibly [even a
depression]{.mark}---in decades.]{.underline}**

Everything would be affected, too, since so many essential products come
from Chinese factories, which would shut down during any possible
Chinese regime collapse. After all, it has been estimated that \$560
billion worth of products come from China annually. And that's just the
tip of the trade spear. The Trump Administration rightly attempted to
reduce America's reliance on China for trade goods, precisely because of
the instability inherent in the Chinese Communist system. Yet, America's
self-described elite refused to countenance any changes to the
U.S.-China trade relationship. Because of that intransigence, should
China's house of cards economy truly collapse, the American people will
be severely harmed. No One is Prepared in Washington

Regardless, U.S. strategists need to be prepared for the real
**[possibility that China's]{.underline}** economic **[collapse will
yield an even [bigger political implosion]{.mark}. That, in turn, could
[lead to the balkanization of China]{.mark}---at least for a period of
time, as what happened during the [Warlord Era]{.mark} in the early
twentieth century.]{.underline}**

And this time, with **[so [many advanced weapons systems]{.mark} lying
around for China's new would-be warlords to lay claim to, the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates might [find itself in the crosshairs of
any of these well-armed, uninhibited post-CCP
warlords]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

No one in the Pentagon is planning for these contingencies. While
there's still a wide chasm between that eventuality and what's happening
in China now, there exists today, with events happening as they are in
China, the greater possibility that such a maw will soon be bridged.
**[[China could implode.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

yc

**[[Xi has kept obvious successors from emerging]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and, if Lam is correct, that shrewd tactic is now working. There is, Lam
pointed out, a "**[[lack of obvious challengers to Xi]{.mark}
Jinping]{.underline}**---figures apparently favored by the party elders,
the military, and the '**[red second generation' are either deemed [not
heavyweight enough or are not interested in the
job]{.mark}]{.underline}**."16

Others, however, believe a leadership change will occur soon. Gregory
Copley, the president of the International Strategic Studies Association
and editor-in-chief of Defense & Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy, told
me the change in leadership could take place as early as August.17 "The
CCP and Xi have apparently agreed on the departure from all offices of
Xi Jinping," he wrote to me. "It is probable that **[[Xi and his
family]{.mark} will be [allowed to 'retire']{.mark} in peace, with some
clear restraint on his movement]{.underline}**. The Party reportedly
agreed that it would not further degrade the status of Xi's father or
the prestige of the memorials to him."18

Holt, the former Air Force general, reports that Xi's mother in early
June held a lunch with various party elders including Hu Jintao, Xi's
immediate predecessor as general secretary, and Wen Jiabao, who served
as premier under Hu. Holt believes the meeting was to "broker a deal for
**[a peaceful transition that would spare Xi humiliation and his
life]{.underline}**."19

Holt believes the transition could take place by the Fourth Plenum,
which might be held in August: "The stage is set and the Party is
working to resolve which leader they will unify behind."20

Another option for Party leaders is to keep Xi in place as a figurehead.
**["Xi Jinping could merely [drift into irrelevance]{.mark}, which is
what happened to Hua Guofeng, Mao Zedong's designated
successor]{.underline}** who was slowly and gently pushed aside by Deng
Xiaoping," Burton told me.21

Deng, considered the Communist Party's "Second Generation" leader,
avoided the chaos accompanying Mao Zedong's many purges, where death was
sometimes the punishment imposed. After Deng lowered the cost of losing
political struggles, Xi, by jailing opponents and their families and
stripping them of their assets, reversed that trend. Xi could be dealt
harshly as well, but his tormentors might decide to spare him an
unpleasant fate in order to show unity at a time of crisis. "The Party,"
noted Copley, "needs to project an image that it is in control and is
now working toward a restoration of sound trading and investment
relations with the U.S. and other powers."22

**[Nonetheless, a [transition from Xi]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whether
kept around or not, **[may [not]{.mark} be [smooth]{.mark}. For one
thing, Gen. Zhang Youxia has made demands of successors]{.underline}**.
"The fly in the ointment is **[[Zhang]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who now
**[shows [little appetite for ceding military control]{.mark} to any
civilian leader]{.underline}**," noted Holt.23 Rumors say **[the
[general has already vetoed one potential replacement]{.mark} because
that person [demanded the reassertion of civilian control over the
P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy.]{.underline}**

**[China could go through either a [period of formal martial law]{.mark}
or a period where the military is informally in control of the country.
The PLA]{.underline}**, after all, may be the **[only institution now
capable of holding China together]{.underline}**. As Copley stated,
**["The damage done to the Chinese economy by Xi Jinping is so profound
that [the Party may find it difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}**--- no
matter what it does---**[[to calm both the domestic
population]{.underline}]{.mark}** and foreign investors and traders."24

Zhang's effective control over the Communist Party may bring some
semblance of stability, **[but the respite can only be temporary. The
[country faces simultaneous crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as an
apparently contracting economy, and long-term afflictions, most
fundamentally collapsing demography. No general or admiral will be able
to solve these underlying afflictions. As Jeff King correctly pointed
out in the Daily Caller in June, "**[Xi's domestic mismanagement has
pushed the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty to the
[edge of legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**."25

By now, most everyone in the leadership blames Xi Jinping for either
creating or aggravating China's problems. He is certainly responsible
for making a bad situation worse, but it would be premature to count him
out. Mao Zedong, Xi's hero, returned from political oblivion several
times, as did Deng. Chinese Communist strongmen have a way of coming
back despite the odds.

Many say that China will now return to a calmer era and that Xi Jinping
is merely an aberration. Anything can happen, but strongmen---Mao, Deng,
and Xi---have dominated the period of CCP rule. If anything, the calm
times were aberrations.

There were calm times during the era of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, the
Party's Third and Fourth Generation leaders. These peaceful periods led
even critics of the regime, most notably Columbia University's Andrew
Nathan, to proclaim that the CCP had solved the one problem plaguing
hardline regimes: succession.26 Many marveled that the Party had
succeeded in institutionalizing norms, guidelines, rules, and practices
that ensured orderly transitions from one leader to the next.

**[The CCP, in reality, has yet [to overcome the succession
problem]{.mark}. There were smooth transitions]{.underline}** from Deng
to Jiang and from Jiang to Hu but **[only because [Deng hand-picked both
Jiang and Hu]{.mark}. Deng could not see so far in the
future]{.underline}** to designate Hu's successor, so **[he [did not
pick Xi Jinping]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Xi has now upended the Communist
Party by junking all the institutional restraints that so many had
praised.

Strongman rule, in reality, is inherent in **[the Party's brutal system,
which idealizes domination, struggle, and violence.]{.underline}**

Even if Xi Jinping has agreed to exit gracefully, **[the [transition
from his rule is bound to be turbulent]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if not
now then in the near future.

So why do we care? **[Because [instability]{.mark} in China [could
convince regime figures to solve their political problems by lashing
out. Mao started the Cultural Revolution to sideline political
enemies]{.mark}. He [did not have a capable military]{.mark}, so he
[could not begin a war]{.mark} for this purpose]{.underline}**. Now,
**[t[he P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy is [capable
enough to start conflicts]{.mark}, so [Xi or someone else could be
tempted to use it not to rally the Chinese
people]{.mark}]{.underline}**---they clearly do not want war now---but
**[to [prevent political enemies at home from mounting
challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The other risk is that the **[[Chinese regime]{.mark}, which for years
has been [provoking countries on China's periphery with "gray
zone"]{.mark}---low-level---[military tactics]{.mark}, will not [be able
to defuse crises that it triggers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unfortunately,
only the most hostile responses are now considered acceptable in a
militarized and highly turbulent Beijing.

**[[Xi in recent years has mobilized all of society for war]{.mark}, but
now [China itself is unstable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is not clear
who, if anyone, is in charge. Therefore, **[[the regime]{.mark}, whoever
controls it, [can take the world by surprise.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### !\-\--Prolif

#### A Taiwan invasion [collapses]{.underline} the NPT---sparks prolif. 

**Davis '23** \[Malcolm Davis, 2-2023, "Chinese Victory over Taiwan --
An Australian Perspective," *The World After Taiwan's Fall*, Pacific

yc

The failure of any U.S. intervention---either one that doesn't happen at
all, or an intervention that is **[[unsuccessful in stopping a Chinese
invasion]{.mark} and occupation of Taiwan]{.underline}**---would
certainly require Australia to recalibrate and rethink its defense
policy based around a possibility that the United States wouldn't be
able to support Australian security, even if ANZUS were to survive. At
the most fundamental level, Australian and American interests are
intertwined and linked at the military-strategic level, with
**[Australian reliance on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence security
guarantees as a foundation for Australia's defense policy]{.underline}**
for decades. Short of a U.S. abandonment of its interests across the
Indo-Pacific in a misguided decision to turn inwards and embrace a new
America First neo-isolationism, and to forego traditional extended
nuclear deterrence security guarantees, U.S. and Australian defense
interests would be likely to remain intertwined, but there would be far
greater demand in Australia to provide for defense self-reliance across
a broader spectrum of operational capabilities, including those for
assuring deterrence. The 2009 Defence White paper stated that whilst
defense self-reliance is a key element of Australian defense policy, the
concept means that ' ... Australia would only expect the United States
to come to our aid in circumstances where we were under threat from a
major power whose military capabilities were simply beyond our capacity
to resist. Short of that situation, the United States would reasonably
expect us to attend to our own direct security needs ...'12 (6.32)
However, it also notes in relation to extended nuclear deterrence that '
... so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are able to rely on the nuclear
forces of the United States to deter nuclear attack on Australia.
Australian defence policy under successive governments has acknowledged
the value to Australia of the protection afforded by extended nuclear
deterrence under the U.S. alliance. **[That protection provides a stable
and reliable sense of assurance and has over the years]{.underline}**
removed the need for Australia to consider more significant and
expensive defence options.'(6.34) The 2020 Defence Strategic Update
maintains the importance of dependence on U.S. extended nuclear
deterrence, stating ' ... **[[only the nuclear and conventional
capabilities]{.mark} of the United States [can offer effective
deterrence]{.mark} against the possibility of nuclear
threats]{.underline}** against Australia. But it is the government's
intent that Australia takes greater responsibility for our own security.
It is therefore essential that the ADF grow its self-reliant ability to
deliver deterrent effects.'13 (2.22)

At the most fundamental level of nuclear deterrence, **[a [failure
of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to intervene in support
of Taiwan]{.underline}**---**[or a failed intervention [leading to a
successful Chinese occupation]{.mark} of Taiwan]{.underline}** and a
U.S. military defeat---would **[[raise questions about the efficacy of
U.S. extended nuclear deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not just for
Australia, but also **[[for other key U.S. allies, such as Japan and
So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea, particularly if an inability to intervene
was in part seen to be driven by implicit or explicit Chinese threats of
nuclear weapons use, in a manner similar to Russia's use of nuclear
threats against NATO]{.underline}** during the Ukraine war. **[The
question that inevitably would be asked would be 'wither U.S. extended
nuclear deterrence]{.underline}**?' and what implications this would
have for **[U.S. partners in the Indo-Pacific [facing an emboldened
China]{.mark} that has [successfully used nuclear
coerc]{.mark}ion]{.underline}**. One option---Australian acquisition of
an independent nuclear deterrent capability in the face of a collapse of
U.S. extended nuclear deterrence security guarantees---would be
technologically very demanding and couldn't be achieved quickly. Simply
building a crude bomb wouldn't be sufficient in the face of China's
extensive nuclear warfighting capacity. Australia would have to consider
delivery systems, nuclear strategy, command and control, and nuclear
capability assurance infrastructure to sustain any independent nuclear
deterrent. The political and strategic effects of such a choice would be
grave given that Australia would in effect, have to walk away from its
obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as well as
the Treaty of Rarotonga and **[one of the consequences of a [successful
Chinese invasion of Taiwan would likely be a collapse of the NPT and the
end of nuclear non-proliferation in general]{.mark}]{.underline}**.14
Even in the face of an aggressive China, it is certain that a
substantial majority of Australians would not support the acquisition of
nuclear weapons.

Under these circumstances, Rod Lyon argues that it is **[highly likely
[that Japan and So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [would abandon their own
commitments to the NPT]{.mark}, especially if a U.S. defeat by China, or
a failure by the United States to respond effectively to a Chinese
challenge, were to undermine the efficacy of U.S. extended nuclear
deterrence in general]{.underline}**. 15 Australia would be in good
company in facing an emboldened, nuclear armed China intent on imposing
its will across the Indo-Pacific, and in such an environment, the
possibility of 'nuclear sharing' could emerge which could see Australia
developing alternative extended deterrence arrangements with Tokyo,
India and even potentially with Seoul, in which **[[all
partners]{.mark}]{.underline}** could collaborate on **[[quickly
establishing nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}** cooperation towards credible
**[[deterrent capability]{.mark} to give Beijing pause]{.underline}**
for thought in any further adventurism. All four states---**[Australia,
India, South Korea and Japan---would need to respond to a drastically
changed strategic environment, dominated by a Chinese hegemon, and thus
would have incentive to support such an arrangement. Under a nuclear
sharing arrangement]{.underline}**, Australia may not necessarily
acquire the weapons, but could contribute other elements of a deterrent,
for example, command and control networks and missile early warning
systems, or supporting technologies for delivery systems.

### U---China Climate Leader

#### China's using the green BRI to establish global dominance in climate change mitigation efforts

[By [taking a proactive role in international negotiations on climate
change and extending]{.mark} the ecological dimension of its Belt and
Road Initiative ([BRI]{.mark}), **[China has been strengthening]{.mark}
its [position as a leader in global environmental
governance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In particular, to [[bolster
environmental]{.mark} [cooperation under]{.mark} the BRI]{.underline}
and to better mitigate the impacts of this grand infrastructure project
on local ecosystems, in 2017, Beijing announced the **[[Green
BRI]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This designation [[reflects China's]{.mark}
ambitions for the BRI [to become]{.mark} [climate‐neutral]{.mark},
resource‐efficient, [nature‐positive]{.mark}, and protective of
biodiversity]{.underline} (Ministry of Environmental Protection et al.,
2017). This article argues that prioritising environmental protection in
foreign policies can enhance a state's status as a ["[green soft power,"
a type of soft power rooted in the environmental and climate aspects of
a state's foreign policy and behaviour]{.mark}.]{.underline} China's
stance on these issues is an essential component of its assertion of
great power status in global politics (Vogler, 2016). The concept of
"status" in this article follows Duque's (2018) relational approach,
which emphasises that status is contingent on social recognition.
[Hence, this approach posits that status emerges from the dynamics of
state relations rather than from direct attributes such as wealth or
military strength.]{.underline} By examining how status specifically
arises from cooperation, this study diverges from much of the literature
on international status, which often focuses on conflicts under the
assumption that the "dynamics associated with status seeking and status
attribution have been forwarded as plausible motivations for a variety
of state behaviors, particularly interstate conflicts" (Miller et al.,
2015).

To [[illustrate how China's]{.mark} green soft power **[status emerges
through relational dynamics]{.mark},** this article examines the
BRI---focusing specifically on its [pilot project]{.mark}, the
[China--Pakistan Economic]{.mark} [Corrido]{.mark}r (CPEC)---aims to
assess the impact of the CPEC on China's "green soft power
reserves,"]{.underline} and it highlights the role of the
China--Pakistan relationship in shaping China's international status.
Announced in 2013, the CPEC is a massive [[infrastructure project
accompanied by geostrategic, diplomatic, and economic
initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark} promoted as a "game‐changer" and a
"win‐win" situation. The CPEC has multifaceted impacts on China and
Pakistan, their relationship, and regional dynamics (Kuszewska &
Nitza‐Makowska, 2021). While the messaging of Beijing and Islamabad is
almost exclusively about the economic and geopolitical gains being
brought by the CPEC, [this project also involves various other impacts
and risks, including several with relevance to the natural environment
and climate.]{.underline} This article focuses on these less‐researched
implications of the CPEC, and it asks the following: What is the impact
of this project on China's green soft power vis‐à‐vis Pakistan and
globally, especially given that it encompasses numerous coal‐based
energy projects? What are the evidence and barriers for the CPEC to
elevate China's status as a green soft power?

#### China's motivation to engage in climate initiatives is to gain soft power

1\. **[[Recognition is essential for China to become a green soft
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although the scholarship on this topic
primarily examines what China does or should do to expand its green soft
power, only a few publications [highlight how [China's environmental
actions are **perceived by foreign governments**]{.mark} and the
public]{.underline}---the intended soft power receivers, as outlined in
Nye's original concept. Nedopil (2023a) [underscores the importance of
international recognition of China's pro‐environmental behaviours. He
links [China's green soft]{.mark} [power not only to Beijing's decision
to exit overseas coal projects]{.mark} but also to the fact that it
announced this move at the United Nations General Assembly in September
2021. This [announcement and subsequent actions **require international
attention**]{.mark} to strengthen China's green soft power
status.]{.underline} Importantly for the sustainability of this status,
following this statement, [[China's BRI‐related]{.mark} [coal
investments decreased]{.mark} from 45% in 2015 [to 0% by]{.mark} early
[2023]{.mark}. Meanwhile, China's investments in solar, wind, and
hydropower energy rose from 33% in 2018 to 77% in 2022 (Nedopil,
2023b).]{.underline} While Nedopil (2023a) highlights the importance of
international recognition in general, Rodenbiker (2023) refers to
particular receivers. [Specifically, he provides two cases of [China's
green soft power operating]{.mark} [through **bilateral
cooperation**]{.mark} on marine spatial planning and community‐based
mangrove conservation [with Thailand and Indonesia]{.mark},
respectively.]{.underline} He concludes that "the capacity of China's
environmental exchanges to influence \[these\] Global South actors to
adopt shared values and positive associations toward China are limited.
Therefore, China's green soft power...is relatively weak" (Rodenbiker,
2023, p. 344). China's green soft power vis‐à‐vis Pakistan has been
mentioned only briefly by Nitza‐Makowska et al. (2024, p. 28). In
particular, this publication focuses on green soft power generation by
reviewing the limited available bilateral documents on the CPEC and
identifying China's intentions to be perceived as a green soft power by
its "all‐weather friend," as China and Pakistan often refer to each
other. However, Nitza‐Makowska et al. (2024) do not elaborate on how
these behaviours are recognised in Pakistan. Therefore, this article
aims to expand on this aspect.

#### China's soft power is key to facilitate green tech transfer to developing countries 

**Nitza‐Makowska 25** \[Agnieszka Nitza‐Makowska; An assistant professor

2\. [**[China's green soft power status emerges from its relations with
others]{.mark}**, though attributes matter.]{.underline} In the view of
Min and Montero (2019), [[green soft power occurs when China provides
**"financial and technical support to its BRI partners**]{.mark} by
sharing experiences and lessons‐learned in clean energy, environment,
and climate policies.]{.underline}" Accordingly, Harlan and Lu (2022)
recognise that the "[soft" approach to greening the BRI is
emerging]{.underline}. Furthermore, they tie this approach to the
"environmentally‐focused activities that forge people‐to‐people
connections with host countries \[including\] training, dialogues,
research, and development projects." They highlight [[the role of "green
cooperation]{.mark}" (Harlan & Lu, 2022, p. 476) that, first, ["offers a
means to position China as an alternative environmental
leader]{.mark}---a kind of green soft power---while also [**facilitating
the transfer of Chinese green technology** and expertise to the Global
South"]{.mark}]{.underline} and, second, "has become a primary venue
through which [China projects influence over global environmental
governance---a kind of green soft power]{.underline}" (Harlan & Lu,
2022, p. 478). These two studies highlight China's technological and
economic attributes, which have elevated it to a leadership position in
renewable energy. While essential, these attributes alone do not make
China a green soft power unless Beijing uses them to engage with other
countries---[for example, by [assisting BRI states in **increasing the
share of renewable energy** in their energy mix]{.mark}, as suggested in
key policy documents and guidelines addressing the environmental aspects
of this connectivity project]{.underline} (Ministry of Environmental
Protection, 2017; Ministry of Environmental Protection et al., 2017).
Referring to China's attributes, Rodenbiker (2023) and Nitza‐Makowska et
al. (2024) question whether this state's poor environmental record can
significantly harm its green soft power status. These studies refer to
the "Panda--Dragon" dichotomy (Nedopil, 2023a), that is, the
[distinction between China's ambitious environmental diplomacy abroad
and its poor but improving domestic environmental profile, as indicated
by its ranking of 154th in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI;
Block et al., 2024). Nevertheless, despite this poor profile, [China has
managed to gain recognition as one of the leaders in the environmental
and climate regime mainly due to its "international environmental
cooperation...\[]{.mark}]{.underline}which\] is conducive to the
elevation of China's international image and soft power in the long run"
(Gang, 2009, pp. 53--54). This confirms the basic assumption underlying
the relational approach to status. That is, status cannot be reduced to
a state's attributes.

The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) published its "Annual
Report on China's Policies and Actions to Address Climate Change 2024"
on 6 November 2024, just ahead of COP29. The report summarises the
results of China's actions since 2023 and gives an overview of new
policies and requirements to address climate change. Here is a summary
of some key developments:

Mitigation of climate change

In November 2023, [[China released its first national policy for methane
emission control]{.underline}]{.mark}, the "Methane Emission Control
Action Plan". According to the report, [[methane emissions can be
reduced by about 57 million]{.mark} [tons of carbon dioxide]{.mark}
equivalent per year after 2030]{.underline}. In 2023, the share of
non-fossil energy in China's total energy consumption grew to 17.9
percent, and the [share of coal consumption dropped from 67.4 percent in
2013 to 55.3 percent.]{.underline} The annual power generation from
renewable energy sources accounted for about one-third of the total
electricity consumption. In the field of transport, the number of new
energy vehicles reached 20.41 million, accounting for 6.1 percent of the
total number of vehicles; the electrification rate of railways rose from
52.3 percent in 2012 to 75.2 percent.

[Adaptation]{.underline} to climate change

By the end of June 2024, the "National Climate Change Adaptation
Strategy 2035" has been implemented in 29 provincial-level localities
and 12 key areas. China has identified 39 cities (districts), including
Beijing's Mentougou District, as pilots for climate resilience and
adaptation. [[Climate change monitoring as well as early warning and
risk management have been strengthened]{.mark}: 27 national climate
observatories and nearly 70,000 ground-based meteorological observation
stations have been built]{.underline} to carry out observations of the
earth system's multiple layers and of meteorological elements on the
ground. At the same time, the capacity of natural ecosystems and
economic and social systems to adapt to climate change is increasing. By
2023, China has completed the ecological protection and restoration of
about 7.7 million hectares; the area of mangrove forests in China has
increased to 30,300 hectares, making China one of the few countries in
the world with a net growth of mangroves. In 2023, China built and
upgraded about 5.74 million hectares of "high-standard" farmland and
about 1.64 million hectares of "high-efficiency" water-saving
irrigation.

Establishment of a national carbon market

With the implementation of the "Interim Regulations on the
Administration of Carbon Emission Trading" (2024) and the issuance of
the "Measures for the Administration of Carbon Emission Trading (for
Trial Implementation)" (2020), the framework of policies and regulations
for the national carbon market has been enhanced. By the end of 2023,
the national carbon emissions trading market covered about 5.1 billion
tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions and included 2,257 key emission
units. With the introduction of penalties for falsification of carbon
emissions data, the system for monitoring, reporting and verification
(MRV) of carbon market and emissions data has been strengthened.

Improvements to the policy system and support guarantee

China has issued the "Work Programme for Accelerating the Construction
of a Dual Control System for Carbon Emissions", incorporating carbon
emission targets and related requirements into national planning. China
has extended its vehicle purchase tax reduction and exemption policy for
new energy vehicles, built a reserve bank of ecological and
environmental protection financial support projects, and expanded the
scope of pilot cities and products for government procurement of green
building materials. In terms of education and human resources training,
China has organized trainings within the government on topics related to
addressing climate change. In addition, the Chinese government has
issued the "Implementation Plan for the Establishment of a Carbon
Footprint Management System", improved the statistical accounting and
monitoring system for greenhouse gas emissions, and carried out
publicity activities such as the National Energy Conservation Awareness
Week to raise social awareness.

[Participation in global climate governance]{.underline}

[[China actively engaged in **bilateral and multilateral climate
change** negotiations as well as strengthened international and
South-South cooperation in the field of climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline} By the end of June 2024, [China had signed
52 documents on South-South cooperation on climate change with 42
developing countries]{.underline}, carried out a series of assistance
and dialogues, and **[[supported developing countries in upgrading their
capacities]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The Annual Report also outlines China's stance on international climate
cooperation. Underlining that developed countries should lead in
emission reductions and financial support, [[China expresses its
willingness to work with all parties to tackle climate change, support
the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and help build a fair and
cooperative global climate governance system]{.mark}.]{.underline} From
discussions at COP29, China expected to reach a new collective finance
goal, to facilitate private sector funding, and to ensure that climate
ambitions are translated into actionable plans.

[[The B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative]{.underline},
as a new vehicle for China\'s integration into the world[,
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} entered its implementation stage since Chinese
President Xi Jinping proposed it in 2013[. Its [spirit of \"peace and
cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual
benefit]{.mark}\"]{.underline} has been deeply ingrained in the hearts
of people around the world. [[China needs to]{.mark} not only push
forward infrastructure construction, but [bring]{.mark} into full play
[its soft power to rally public support and reach consensus]{.mark},
which will lay a solid social foundation [for future regional
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. There have been some opinions voicing
that China uses the initiative to export its overcapacity. Yet, the
practice and facts over the past three years have effectively refuted
these points of view. [It is through the initiative that a bigger
community of common interests and destiny is taking shape]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, the difficulty, complexity and pluralism in building the
initiative determine that to realize the great vision entails not only
hard power but soft power. [[Soft power helps promote heart-to-heart
communication, mutual understanding, recognition and support,]{.mark}
all of [which are necessary for sustainable and long-term
cooperation]{.mark}. [Building soft power should be an integral part of
the Belt and Road construction]{.mark}, so as to tell stories about
China well and spread China\'s voice well]{.underline}. Primarily,
people should always be put first. [The building]{.mark} of the Silk
Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, [[to a large
extent, needs]{.mark} first of all [connectivity of people]{.mark} and
people-to-people exchanges.]{.underline} This is conducive to reaching
consensus, which is key to transcending geographic borders. Thus the
construction of the Belt and Road should be based on the foundation of
respecting human needs and dignity, as well as seeking [for win-win
cooperation]{.mark} and mutual learning. That\'s the prerequisite for
deep-level cultural exchanges. Cultural differences constitute the
biggest discrepancies among countries along the routes. Cultural
integration is the most urgent and important integration among others,
and cultural exchanges and cooperation are a core element of the Belt
and Road Initiative. Culture is a bridge to better deepen exchanges and
cooperation among different countries and fields. A successful example
is that China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan succeeded in applying for the
UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status for the Silk Roads: Routes Network
of the Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor through joint efforts in 2014.
[[Another important element]{.mark} of the Belt and Road construction
[is the alignment of soft environment, which includes alignment of
policies and technical standards.]{.mark}]{.underline} By June 2016,
China had signed free trade agreements with 11 countries and bilateral
investment treaties with 56 countries along the routes. [[It is
necessary for China to step up the soft environment
alignment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Efforts should be made to align with
relevant countries\' development plans through negotiation and
consultation, so that the regional economic cooperation framework and
rules can be adaptive to each other. All relevant parties should reduce
trade barriers, remove obstacles blocking the free flow of factors of

Introduction Thank you for the opportunity to testify on China's Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI), and its implications for U.S. interests. The
Commission asked me to focus on the BRI's economic dimensions. I will
address four key questions in this regard: What are the key trends in
BRI projects to date, and to what extent do BRI projects follow market
rules and international standards? What tools has Beijing used to boost
Chinese exports under the BRI? How has the BRI affected China's trade
and investment patterns, its diplomatic reach, and its soft power? What
are the economic implications of the BRI for the United States? After
addressing these questions, I will conclude with brief recommendations
for Congressional action. Hot Spots and Blind Spots: Key Trends in BRI
Projects The BRI is the most ambitious geoeconomic vision in recent
history. Spanning some 70 countries, it can claim to cover more than
two-thirds of the world's population. It could include Chinese
investments approaching \$4 trillion.1 It intends to strengthen hard
infrastructure with new roads and railways, soft infrastructure with
trade and transportation agreements, and even cultural ties with
university scholarships and other people-to-people exchanges. In all
these ways, when much of the West is looking inward, China is connecting
with the world. The BRI is also the best-known, least-understood foreign
policy effort underway. Beyond investments in actual projects, China
spends significant resources organizing BRI events, promoting BRI
stories, and conducting other outreach. Recognition within and outside
China has been growing. Chinese state media claim that global awareness
of the BRI has tripled between 2014 and 2017, increasing from 6 percent
to 18 percent in a survey of 22 countries.2 Nearly 30 world leaders and
representatives from 110 countries and international organizations
attended the BRI Forum in May 2017. The event, hosted by President Xi
Jinping, received significant global coverage. Attention and awareness
continues to climb, especially in the West. In recent weeks, the
Financial Times,3 the New York Times,4 and other international outlets
have all included reporting on BRI-related projects. But for all the
attention the BRI receives, there is little reliable information about
how it is unfolding in aggregate. A major challenge is that the BRI
label evades classification. There is no agreed-upon definition for what
qualifies as a BRI project.5 There are roughly 70 countries
participating in the BRI, according to Chinese state media. Yet there
are Chinese-funded projects in non-participant countries that share many
of the same characteristics. The BRI was officially launched in November
2013, but projects started years earlier are often counted. The BRI
banner hangs over a wide and ever-expanding list of activities. There
are BRI fashion shows, concerts, and art exhibits. By design, the BRI is
more a loose brand than a program with strict criteria. Infrastructure
is a major component of the BRI and provides a window into its drivers
and broader implications. For three years, the Reconnecting Asia Project
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has been
tracking infrastructure projects across the Eurasian supercontinent. Our
website, ReconnectingAsia.CSIS.org, has an interactive map, an
open-source database of over 2,200 transportation projects, and expert
analysis. To date, this database has focused on transportation projects:
road, railroads, seaports, and dry ports. It will expand in the future
to include power plants, pipelines, telecommunications, and other
connectivity infrastructure. China is not the only focal point of this
database, which covers all funders, but it is the most active. As this
database grows, several trends are emerging. First, China is often the
biggest spender, but it is not the only consequential actor. Across the
Eurasian supercontinent, three zones of competition are emerging. In
Southeast Asia, Japan is outspending China in several countries. In
Central Asia, the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral
development banks (MDB) have significant activities underway. In Eastern
and Central Europe, European funders remain dominant in many countries.
To be sure, this is not a zero-sum contest, and there are numerous
projects with both Chinese and MDB funding. These areas will be
important to watch as China continues to compete with, and adapt to,
other visions for connectivity. Second, Chinese projects are less open
to local and international participation. Out of all contractors
participating in Chinese-funded projects within the Reconnecting Asia
database, 89 percent are Chinese companies, 7.6 percent are local
companies (companies headquartered in the same country where the project
was taking place), and 3.4 percent are foreign companies (non-Chinese
companies from a country other than the one where the project was taking
place). In comparison, out of the contractors participating in projects
funded by the multilateral development banks, 29 percent are Chinese,
40.8 percent are local, and 30.2 percent are foreign. These findings
illuminate some difficult practical and political realities. Practically
speaking, it should not come as a surprise that Chinese companies are
winning more contracts for Chinese-funded projects. Despite official
rhetoric about the BRI being open and global, it is a China-centric
effort. Chinese companies are also extremely competitive in the
transportation sector. It is possible that Western firms are more
competitive in providing related services around these projects, such as
consulting and legal services, but further research is needed. China's
advantage also stems from some of the tools it uses, which are explained
further in the next section. Third, Chinese projects are less
transparent at earlier stages of the project lifecycle. The Reconnecting
Asia Project recently ran an experiment that scored the project pages in
our database for completeness. Projects with more data fields completed
received more points. Scoring was adjusted based on the project status.
A project that is just under negotiation, for example, would not be
expected to have as much information as a completed project. We found no
meaningful difference in the amount of information available for
Chinese-funded projects versus projects supported by various
multilateral development banks. They all scored in the low to mid 80's
out of 100, roughly B's and B-minuses. But transparency is tricky. How
do you evaluate projects that you cannot find? To get closer to
answering that question, we examined the status levels for projects in
our database. We have six status levels -- beginning with "announced"
and ending with "completed" or "cancelled" -- and there are some
projects for which the status is unknown. What jumped out in this
comparison between MDB projects and projects from the China Development
Bank is the difference in early stage projects. About 7 percent of our
MDB projects are marked as announced, which is the earliest stage in our
database. To date, the database does not have any China Development Bank
(CDB) projects in the earliest stage ("announced"), and it has a higher
percentage of CDB projects that are completed. These trends could change
over time. Indeed, it is in everyone's long-term interest that projects
are open and transparent. Greater openness and transparency benefits
recipient countries by ensuring the companies participating are the best
for the job[. [If there is little or no information available publicly
about early stage projects, it is impossible to have an open and fair
competition. Even China stands to benefit over the longer
term]{.mark}]{.underline}. Right now, U.S. and other Western firms are
genuinely interested in participating in BRI-related projects. But
unless there are more opportunities to participate, that interest will
wane and suspicion will rise. More countries will start to ask why they
joined the BRI, and those that have not joined will not. The Visible
Hand: China's Tools China uses several tools to boost its exports, many
of them now falling under the BRI banner: national champions, credit,
infrastructure, and trade agreements. Chinese state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) often benefit from tremendous scale and subsidies. They have
dramatically moved up the global rankings in recent years. In 2000,
Fortune's Global 500 list of the world's largest companies by revenue
included 10 Chinese firms, of which 9 were state-owned.6 In 2017, the
list included 107 Chinese firms, of which 75 were state-owned. This
trend is especially stark in the construction industry. In 2017, seven
of the ten largest construction companies in the world, by revenue, were
Chinese.7 When Chinese SOEs compete for foreign contracts, they bring
these advantages to the table. Credit is a powerful incentive. According
to researchers at William and Mary, Chinese lending during 2000-2014
totaled \$354.4 billion, with lending highest in the transport and power
sectors.8 Of these loans, about three quarters had commercial terms.
China is successful at locking in higher rates because it agrees to
assume risks that other lenders will not. In Sri Lanka, which I visited
earlier this month, China was willing to provide a \$1.3 billion loan
for a new port after MDBs declined. After Sri Lanka could not repay the
interest on its debt, China agreed to take equity in the port. China is
also proactive, offering to pursue projects without solicitation. Its
loans to Sri Lanka now exceed \$8 billion, a sum that grew as leaders
found each project too tempting to turn down.9 Infrastructure projects
have short and long-term implications for Chinese exports. In the short
term, these projects are aiding Chinese exports of construction-related
goods. Chinese exports to Pakistan, for example, increased 77 percent
between 2012 and 2015.10 Chinese producers of steel, concrete, and other
construction materials stand to benefit from projects that use them, as
do Chinese engineering and construction firms. These activities provide
important but modest relief for Chinese overcapacity, a problem that
will still need to be addressed even if the BRI's ambitious spending
targets are reached. Despite the BRI's scale, it is too small to solve
China's overcapacity challenges.11 Over the longer term, new
infrastructure could facilitate trade by improving connectivity between
China and its trading partners. The actual impacts will depend on both
macro and micro factors, such as the trajectories of the recipient
economies and whether the right projects were selected. There is no
question the region needs infrastructure investment. [[Developing Asia
alone requires \$26 trillion in infrastructure investment between 2017
and 2030 to maintain current growth rates and adapt to climate change,
according to ADB estimates]{.underline}]{.mark}.12 If all that
infrastructure appeared tomorrow, flawlessly built where markets
required it, there would be large trade gains. But many barriers to
trade would still remain, from onerous customs paperwork to divergent
standards. Upgrading Asia's "soft" infrastructure will be important as
well. Trade agreements could provide that upgrade, and they have been
placed under the BRI banner as well. Chinese officials have described a
network of free trade agreements that would support the BRI, but to
date, China appears primarily focused on bilateral trade deals.13 Given
the diverse list of countries participating in the BRI, a BRI-wide trade
agreement is highly unlikely. While lowering barriers between China and
individual markets, additional bilateral deals could further complicate
a web of rules that firms struggle to navigate, as could the 130
transportation agreements that China says it has concluded with BRI
participants.14 Neither of these efforts has the trade-promoting
potential of a high-standard regional agreement or a truly multilateral
effort. Equally important is how China brings these tools together.
China's approach is centralized yet flexible. It is centralized in
bringing together many of the above elements in a single deal. When a
recipient country considers an offer from China, it often interacts with
all the key actors, who often present a unified front. This differs from
the "Western approach," which involves dealing separately with a wider
range of actors, including some who coordinate loosely, others that
operate independently, and others that actively compete with each
other.15 China's approach is flexible in at least three respects. First,
China is willing to work with any government. While this approach
predates the BRI, it can be seen in the list of BRI participants, which
even includes participants with active conflicts, such as Syria and
Yemen.16 Second, China is often willing to build to budget and with less
stringent requirements for meeting social and environmental safeguards.
Third, China is flexible in negotiating payment terms. It is willing to
accept natural resources, for example, and when loans cannot be repaid
it is sometimes willing to take equity. Centralization and flexibility
provide more ways to get to "yes," and they help get there faster. All
these tools magnify short-term incentives for starting projects, but
they can also mask long-term risks. Access and Influence: Economic and
Political Impacts The economic and political impacts of the BRI are
difficult to isolate and could even have opposing short and long-term
implications. As noted earlier, the BRI is more a brand than a master
plan with specific criteria for project inclusion. Temporally,
functionally, and geographically, what counts as a BRI project is open
to interpretation. Even obvious cases can have complicating factors. For
example, there is a lag between the announcement of infrastructure
projects, construction, completion, and usage. The economic impact of a
recently-completed railway project, for example, will not become clear
for several years. This is a frustrating answer, particularly for a
hearing with a title that reminds us that the BRI's fifth anniversary is
later this year. Consistent, long-term monitoring of BRI-related
activities will be important for finding more exact answers. Chinese
government statements about the BRI's economic impacts help illustrate
these challenges. Chinese officials and state media often frame the
BRI's impacts in broad terms. It is common to hear about trade,
investment, tourism, and other flows between China and "BRI partners" or
"BRI countries."17 Some studies have claimed the BRI is greatly
enhancing these connections. But they use questionable timelines, often
relying on data that predates the BRI, and do not separate recent
developments from economic trends that were underway before the BRI.
Other popular metrics are often incomplete. For example, Chinese state
media trumpet the increase in freight train services between China and
Europe. But they do not state the value of cargo carried, and they
rarely refer to trains traveling in the opposite direction, which occur
less frequently and carry more empty containers. With these challenges
in mind, there are some nascent trends that merit further observation.
First, Chinese outbound capital restrictions appear to be more relaxed
for BRI-related transactions. Deals that might be classified as
advancing the BRI are more likely to be approved, and to be approved
faster.18 In contrast, China has been reining in outbound deals for
foreign real estate, entertainment, and sports teams.19 Third, the BRI's
emphasis on infrastructure has helped boost Chinese exports of
construction-related goods and services. The longer-term trajectories of
these trends, whether outbound capital is invested effectively and
transportation corridors mature into economic corridors, hinge on
implementation. Politically, China is already benefitting from the BRI
with individual countries and globally. Traditional partners like
Pakistan, where BRI-related investments total roughly \$62 billion, have
become even closer. Chinese infrastructure loans have helped persuade
some countries, including the Philippines and Cambodia, to reevaluate
military or diplomatic ties with the United States. China is also
forging ties with countries further west, particularly those in Central
and Eastern Europe. China's "16+1" framework brings together a diverse
set of countries in the region, many of whom have little in common other
than their interest in doing business with China. These and other
developments suggest the BRI is producing political dividends. Globally,
the BRI positions China as the leader of a new form of globalization.
Much of this rhetoric sounds familiar, but carries a different meaning.
For example, in his opening remarks at the BRI Forum in May 2017,
Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke about upholding the multilateral
trading system, liberalizing investment, and promoting transparent
rules. "We should build an open platform of cooperation," he urged, "and
uphold and grow an open world economy." But the BRI's openness is
questionable, as evident in the contractor trends noted earlier. Yet
other countries are beginning to echo this rhetoric. Several have
announced their intentions to "link" their national development plans
and broader economic initiatives with the BRI. Economically and
politically, the BRI also faces near-term constraints and longer-term
challenges. When smaller economies do business with China, they are
often balancing rather than directly aligning themselves. Dependencies
can develop over time, of course, as Sri Lanka's experience illustrates.
But smaller countries also seek to diversify their economic
relationships. In 2016, for example, every leader that took office in
Southeast Asia discussed infrastructure projects with both China and
Japan. "This is a good competition," Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri
Mulyani Indrawati said last year.20 A key question for the longer term
is whether this competition fosters a race to the top in standards and
quality, or a race to the bottom. Not all the BRI's political impacts
have been positive. For some countries that have signed on, there is a
gap emerging between expectations and actual benefits. South Korea has
embraced the initiative, for example, but it has yet to cooperate with
China on concrete projects. Economic cooperation has been held up by
differences over North Korea, highlighting how the BRI can quickly take
a backseat to other interests.21 The BRI has been met with various
degrees of skepticism and concern elsewhere, such as Western Europe,
Japan, and India. The BRI's roster may seem long at roughly 70
participants, but that still leaves about 125 countries that have not
joined. Ultimately, the BRI's longer-term political impacts hinge on its
execution and its economic performance. Over time, support for the BRI
could decline and even turn against China. Large infrastructure projects
are rarely delivered on time, on budget, with their promised
benefits---even in the best businesses environments.22 Most BRI-related
projects will encounter difficulties in the coming years. Projects that
rely too heavily on Chinese labor, rather than local labor, can stoke
resentment. Some projects will fail outright. Others will creep along
and succeed only partially -- delivering some commercial benefits, for
example, while also introducing environmental costs. When projects
disappoint for any reason, China stands to suffer reputational damage.
What looks like boldness today might look like hubris in two decades.
The BRI is also constrained by China's domestic political imperatives.
The BRI aims to increase the flow of goods and people, but China's
overbearing security presence near border areas is suffocating
commercial activity. Chinese capital controls, while favoring outbound
investment for BRI-related projects, are still inefficient and overly
restrictive for inbound investments. The BRI aspires to promote the
exchange of ideas and knowledge, but Chinese censorship is increasing.
These trends all contradict the BRI's expressed goal of improving global
connectivity. Beijing's dilemma is that greater connectivity requires
giving up some control. Winning Business and Shaping Systems: U.S.
Economic Interests Whether the BRI succeeds or fails, its vast scale and
scope guarantees consequences for U.S. interests. The United States has
a range of economic interests at stake, from immediate commercial
opportunities to ensuring the viability and stability of major global
systems in the longer term. Commercial opportunities should exist for
U.S. suppliers, service providers, and investors to participate in
BRI-related projects. To date, U.S. suppliers that have participated
have often done so through joint-ventures with Chinese firms. There are
also opportunities for U.S. logistics firms and other potential users of
completed projects. Hewlett-Packard, for example, was an early pioneer
of the direct China-Europe freight trains that are now expanding. To
date, however, U.S. and Western firm participation in BRI-related
projects has been relatively modest. At least three barriers stand
between U.S. companies and BRI-related projects. First, companies need
access to timely and accurate information about BRI-related
opportunities. Many U.S. companies are now aware of the BRI's potential
scale and wide range of activities, but they are struggling to identify
concrete business opportunities. As noted earlier, one of the nascent
trends in the CSIS Reconnecting Asia database is that public information
about some Chinese-funded projects is more difficult to obtain in the
project's earliest stages, which is typically when bids are solicited.
Greater transparency would help. Second, after learning about specific
opportunities, U.S. companies sometimes confront an uneven playing
field. Many of the tools for advancing the BRI noted earlier give
Chinese firms an edge in winning contracts. National champions benefit
from state subsidies. Financing can be tied to picking Chinese firms. As
noted earlier, the low participation of U.S. contractors in
Chinese-funded transportation projects is not a challenge unique to U.S.
firms but affects non-Chinese firms more generally. Different methods
for estimating project costs and revenues can also favor Chinese firms.
These considerations extend beyond U.S. competitiveness and also impact
[recipient countries, which risk entering commitments without fully
accounting for operations, maintenance, and other lifecycle
costs.]{.underline} Third, even if competition is open and fair, a host
of risks can outweigh the potential rewards for U.S. firms. Partnering
with foreign firms can present IP-theft risks. Elections, corruption,
complicated land rights, and other political and legal risks can
threaten a project's viability. Funding risks arise from the
capital-intensive nature of infrastructure projects, long repayment
schedules, and the challenges that developing economies might encounter
along the way.23 When projects are completed, weak demand and other
operational challenges remain. These risks are a primary reason why U.S.
institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies,
rarely venture into emerging market infrastructure. Even more important
to U.S. economic interests is the BRI's longer-term impact on major
global systems. Since World War II, the United States has played a
leading role in creating, expanding, and defending open trade and
financial systems. The United States has done this not merely out of
goodwill, but also out of self-interest. U.S. economic strength flows
from the dynamism of its private sector and the U.S. economy's central
position within these systems. Of course, globalization has also
produced costs at home, a critical challenge that must be addressed but
is outside the scope of this hearing. But as foreign markets have grown
over the past seven-plus decades, so has the United States. A
[BRI]{.mark} that succeeds on China's terms could revise these systems
to reflect Chinese interests. Changes would be seen in supply chains for
goods, from manufactured products to energy and other resources. China's
currency would become more widely used. Chinese technical standards, for
everything from high-speed railway systems to wireless networks, would
become more widely adopted, as would Chinese preferences for
environmental and social safeguards. Collectively, these changes would
push the United States away from its current position in the global
economy and move China toward the center. A BRI that fails also has
implications for U.S. economic interests. The financial burden that
developing economies are assuming through Chinese loans is considerable.
[[Many]{.mark} [recipients are counting on sustaining high GDP growth to
pay back their loans, setting ambitious targets that leave little room
for error or unexpected events]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Many of
today's assumptions about China are also based on its spectacular rates
of growth over recent decades. [[Events within or outside China could
lead to enough of these loans failing as to impact the broader global
economy]{.underline}.]{.mark} Rather than helping write the next chapter
in regional integration, [[a failing BRI could set the region back,
harming global growth. These economic developments carry strategic
implications as well. A separate panel will address strategic concerns
in greater detail, but two areas are intimately tied with the BRI's
infrastructure focus and should be briefly noted.]{.underline} [First,
transportation infrastructure is dual-use, meaning that it can be used
to move goods to market as well as militaries to battle. Second and more
broadly, the United States has the same fundamental interest it has had
since World War II in ensuring that no single power dominates the
Eurasian supercontinent. If a hegemon does emerge, history suggests that
new infrastructure will be an important indicator and vehicle for
influence.]{.underline}]{.mark} Recommendations The United States must
not only be vigilant, it must advance a vision of its own for the
region. It is sobering to recall the U.S. position in Asia at the
beginning of this century. In 2000, a bipartisan commission at the
Harvard Kennedy School examined U.S. national interests and noted, "No
country in East Asia, including China, appears capable of seriously
challenging US leadership any time soon unless America, through neglect
or indifference, were to create a vacuum."24 Today, the U.S. position in
Asia is considerably weaker. Neglect can be seen in the U.S. decision to
withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Indifference can be seen in
the absence of a positive U.S. economic vision for the region. The
Administration's support for a "free and open Indo-Pacific" is a welcome
development. Featured prominently in both the U.S. National Security
Strategy and National Defense Strategy, this framing has several
strengths. It focuses on what is likely to be the main arena for great
power competition, economically and strategically, in the twenty-first
century. It emphasizes the maritime domain, which despite the BRI's
ambitions to create new economic corridors across the Eurasian landmass,
will remain the primary conduit for global trade. It positions the U.S.
to work closely with allies and partners in the region, many of whom
have expressed similar aspirations. But more must be done to
operationalize these ideas. Resources matter more than rhetoric. For
example, it is necessary but not sufficient to warn recipient countries
against risky lending and questionable projects. Put yourself in the
shoes of a foreign leader seeking international support for
infrastructure projects. On the one hand, you have offers for specific
projects that could start immediately. On the other hand, you have
warnings about medium and long-term risks. Politically and
psychologically, the scales are tilted toward taking the risky offer
today. Even the strongest language is not likely to persuade recipient
countries to turn down risky infrastructure offers, particularly those
with acute development needs. What's needed are better alternatives.
Working with the Administration, Congress has an important role to play
in operationalizing the "Indo-Pacific" concept and expanding the
availability of better financing alternatives. First, Congress should
direct the Administration to establish standards and principles for
infrastructure investment in the region. There is growing recognition
about the importance of "quality infrastructure," but there are
competing definitions for what quality means. The challenge is not only
building consensus about preferred outcomes, but also the processes that
lead to better outcomes. These standards would cover procurement,
environmental and social safeguards, and debt sustainability, among
other issues. Second, to build international support for these
principles, Congress should preserve U.S. influence in the World Bank,
Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral development banks. China
alone cannot meet Asia's infrastructure needs, and these institutions
will remain central in setting standards and providing alternatives. The
Administration can also build support by working with partners and
allies and through the G-20 and other multilateral bodies. Done
correctly, these principles will take hold not only in Asia, but in
other regions where competing approaches exist, such as Eastern and
Central Europe. Third, to help U.S. companies compete overseas, Congress
should strengthen the U.S. foreign economic policy toolkit. Concerns
about the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation
crowding out private sector investment, while grounded in economic
theory, are at odds with economic reality. Foreign governments have
already tilted the playing field. There is merit in considering whether
some U.S. commercial agencies could be consolidated and streamlined for
greater efficiency and unity of action, but the bottom line is that
their activities should be fully resourced, as should the U.S.
Department of State. To be sure, the United States should not aspire to
replicate the BRI's scale with federal spending. But through resourcing
the efforts mentioned above, the U.S. and its partners and allies can
expand private sector investment. Globally, institutional
investors---such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies,
and others such as sovereign wealth funds---manage more than \$100
trillion.25 Only a small fraction of that largess is invested in
infrastructure. The actions recommended above would help manage risks,
expand the pool of bankable projects, and mobilize more private capital.
The BRI has all the marks of a difficult foreign policy challenge. It is
a slow-moving development that will unfold in decades rather than days.
It is functionally and geographically vast, spanning the
responsibilities of many U.S. agencies. It requires grappling with both
economics and security issues. It will be tempting to delay action and
difficult to coordinate an effective response. [[Ultimately, the best
U.S. response to the BRI is not a response at all]{.underline},]{.mark}
but a compelling U.S. economic vision, resourced strategically and
sustained over time.

SAN SALVADOR/WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco
Rubio on Monday welcomed [Panama]{.mark}\'s decision to [let its
participation in China\'s global infrastructure plan expire, calling the
move \"a great step forward\" for its ties with the United
States]{.mark}. Any move by Panama to distance itself from Chinese
President Xi Jinping\'s signature Belt and Road Initiative is a win for
[Washington]{.mark}, which has [argued that Beijing uses the scheme for
\"debt trap diplomacy\"]{.mark} to cement its global influence. The
Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to
start your day. Sign up here. Rubio this week made his first overseas
trip as the top U.S. diplomat under President Donald Trump to Panama, a
close [U.S. partner in Latin America, and pressured the country over its
ties with China.]{.mark} After talks with Rubio, [Panama]{.mark}\'s
President Jose Raul Mulino said his country\'s broad [agreement to
contribute to the Chinese initiative will not be renewed]{.mark}, and
could be terminated early. He said the deal was set to expire in two to
three years, but did not elaborate. \"Yesterday\'s announcement by
President \@JoseRaulMulino that [Panama will allow its participation in
the CCP\'s Belt and Road Initiative to expire is a great step forward
for U.S.-Panama relations]{.mark}, a free Panama Canal, and another
example of \@POTUS leadership to protect our national security and
deliver prosperity for the American people,\" Rubio posted on X after
departing the country. Panama was the first Latin American country to
officially endorse the Belt and Road Initiative in November 2017, five
months after switching diplomatic ties to China from Taiwan, the
democratically governed island Beijing claims as its territory. [China
rejects Western criticism of the plan, saying well over 100 countries
have joined it, and that it has boosted global development with new
ports, bridges, railways and other projects]{.mark}. Panama had made a
\"regrettable decision,\" China\'s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong said. \"[The
smear campaign that is launched by the U.S. and some of the other
Western countries on the Belt and Road Initiative is totally
groundless]{.mark},\" Fu told a news conference in New York. Still, the
[Chinese infrastructure plan has faced controversy,]{.mark} with some
partner nations bemoaning the high cost of projects and struggling to
repay loans. [Italy withdrew from the initiative in 2023 under U.S.
pressure over concerns about Beijing\'s economic reach.]{.mark} Ukraine

OPERATIONS U.S. concerns have long extended to some Chinese companies\'
operations near the Panama Canal, built by the United States in the
early 20th century and handed over to Panama in 1999. A Hong Kong-based
firm operates two ports at both entrances of the waterway, while two
Chinese state-owned firms are separately building a fourth bridge over
one of the canal\'s entrances. The U.S. State Department said on Sunday
that [Rubio delivered a message from Trump that China\'s presence there
was a threat to the canal]{.mark} and a violation of the U.S.-Panama
treaty. After talks with Rubio, Mulino signaled a willingness to review
the 25-year concession to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings
(0001.HK), opens new tab, renewed in 2021 for the operation of the two
entrance ports, pending the results of an audit. The contract has been
targeted by U.S. lawmakers and the government as an example of China\'s
expansion in Panama, which they say goes against a neutrality treaty
signed by both countries in 1977.

components: [China's growing investments in the Arctic states may
[directly bolster China's influence in the area]{.mark} and the
realization of shared goals may reinforce the idea of China as a
cooperating and peace-seeking country]{.underline}.

Greenland's relevance for China's strategy

As a huge and isolated island located at the extreme North of the world,
[[Greenland]{.mark} has historically occupied a strategic
position.]{.underline} During the Second World War, Greenland's position
was especially significant for the United States, which took advantage
of icy relations between Denmark and its colony, and established
thirteen army bases and four naval bases there.. Greenland was
exceptionally relevant to American foreign policy because having control
of the region meant blocking enemy access to North America. It also
served as a key transit point to Europe, a strategic location to obtain
forecast information, and had many valuable minerals which could be
exploited.11) After the end of the Cold War, most of the US bases were
dismantled, and currently only the Thule Air base is still operational,
regulated by the Igaliku Agreement. The closure of its many military
bases on Greenland meant a reduction in the American influence on the
island. However, Greenland's strategic position is still very attractive
for many other states, not only for its geographical position, but also
because of the presence of onshore and offshore hydrocarbon deposits and
mineral basins. By mapping the undiscovered oil and gas basins in the
Arctic territory not yet exploited, Donald L. Gautier et al.12) have
revealed the proximity of many of them to Greenland's coasts. According
to the U.S. Geological Survey's, [the region [consists of the "25% of
the world's]{.mark} [undiscovered hydrocarbon resources along with
9]{.mark}% of the world's coal and [other]{.mark} economically [critical
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}".13) According to another report, the U.S.
Geological Survey (2008) estimates as follows: "[a mean of [7.3 billion
barrels]{.mark} of oil and a mean of 52 trillion cubic feet of
undiscovered natural gas]{.underline} in the West Greenland--East Canada
Province north of the Arctic Circle". Greenland is also interested in
expanding its rights beyond the 200 nautical miles: following the
process regulated by UNCLOS Annex II, art. 4, the Danish government and
the Greenlandic self-government have submitted the necessary information
concerning the areas both North and South of Greenland to the UN
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in an effort to extend
their territory.14)

Even though [[China strives for establishing]{.mark} what Chinese
President Xi Jinping has defined as the "[New
normal]{.mark}]{.underline}",15) a [[domestic-driven economic
model]{.mark} and a mid-to-high-speed growth with higher efficiency and
lower cost]{.underline},16) from the tenth China's Five Year plan
(2001-2005), it has turned its attention to nations and regions that
possess significant natural resources in order to enhance its energy and
mineral sector.17) From this point of view, [[Greenland]{.mark} may be
[considered]{.mark} an [extremely relevant partner]{.mark} for China due
to its [rich deposits]{.mark} [of **iron**, **zinc**, **rare earth
elements**, and **uranium**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rare earth elements
consist of 17 different minerals, including uranium, that are mainly
used in the automotive industry, and for manufacturing magnets and
weapons. They occur together and the separation process consists of an
extremely polluting process that takes place in the first instance at
the mine and later in the processing plants that may be a different
place.

Although [[China]{.mark} has very large [reserves]{.mark}, its iron ore
has always been [classified as low grade]{.mark}]{.underline}. From
2010-2011, many low grade deposits have been exploited, reaching a
domestic production of iron ore of 1.32 billion tons. While China's
economic growth started to slow down after 2012, supplies from overseas
deposits continue to increase.18) Even though China has 30% of the
global reserves of the rare earth elements, it produces more than 80% of
the global output.19)

#### Chinese leadership is key to Arctic global governance

**Bontempi '25** \[ Tommaso; January 27; Journalist specializing in
Arctic Geopolitics, China's Arctic Strategy, Maritime Expansion, and
Governance Frameworks for Osservatorio Artico, he earned his Master's
level degree in Comparative International Relations from the Università
Ca' Foscari di Venezia; The Arctic Century, "Beijing\'s \'Polar Push\':
China\'s Expanding Influence in the Arctic";
https://arcticcentury.org/posts/beijings-polar-push/\] bryce

[[**China**'s strategic ambitions]{.mark} have increasingly [turned
towards]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a **[[region rich
in resources]{.mark} and [political significance]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This shift aligns with the Nation's broader maritime aspirations, as
articulated during the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party, held in Beijing from the 16th to the 22nd of October 2022. In his
report to the Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping underscored, among
other things, the **[[importance of enhancing China's]{.mark} maritime
[capabilities to safeguard national security]{.mark} and [promote
economic development]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

This long-term vision reflects the growing recognition of the Arctic's
role in reshaping global dynamics. **[Melting ice caps are unveiling
[rich opportunities]{.mark} for resource extraction and shipping,
[notably the Northern Sea Route]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Recognising
these prospects, [**[China has sought to establish]{.mark} a
[presence]{.mark} in the region, [engaging in scientific
research]{.mark}, [infrastructure development]{.mark} and [diplomatic
initiatives]{.mark} to secure its role as a major (quasi) Arctic
stakeholde**r]{.underline}.

China's Arctic Strategy

**[China's approach to the Arctic is a mixture of [political]{.mark},
[economic]{.mark} and [scientific]{.mark} objectives]{.underline}**. The
establishment of research stations, such as the Yellow River Station in
Norway's Svalbard archipelago, **[[demonstrate Beijing's intent to
contribute to polar science]{.mark} [while solidifying its presence in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} These stations have enabled
Chinese researchers to conduct studies on climate change and Arctic
ecosystems, further justifying their foothold in a traditionally
exclusive region.

In 2013, **[China attained [observer status]{.mark} in the Arctic
Council]{.underline}**, a significant milestone for a non-Arctic state.
**[This status [allows China to participate in discussions]{.mark}
concerning Arctic governance, [presenting itself as a cooperative
partner]{.mark} while advancing its own strategic
interests]{.underline}**. Through this forum, Beijing has cultivated its
image as a responsible stakeholder, possibly positioning itself to
influence future policymaking in the region.

Cooperation with Russia represents another cornerstone of China's Arctic
strategy. The two countries have collaborated on the development of the
Northern Sea Route (sometimes, perhaps daringly, referred to as the Ice
Silk Road). This partnership not only aligns with China's Belt and Road
Initiative but also provides an alternative trade route to the Suez
Canal, significantly reducing shipping times and costs between Asia and
Europe. In addition to this logistical advantage, China has invested
heavily in Arctic infrastructure and resource extraction projects,
seeking to access the region's vast reserves of oil, gas and minerals.

China's Interest in Norway's Arctic Expertise

But China's Arctic ambitions extend beyond establishing its presence
through research stations and observer status in the Arctic Council. One
of the more significant aspects of its strategy is its efforts to
leverage Norwegian expertise in Arctic technologies. Norway, as a
prominent Arctic state, has developed advanced capabilities in deep-sea
mining, offshore drilling and cold-weather resource extraction. These
skills are critical for accessing the vast reserves of hydrocarbons and
minerals hidden beneath the Arctic Ocean.

In particular, **[[China has shown a keen interest in
collaborations]{.mark} that could facilitate knowledge
transfer]{.underline}**. The China-Norway Marine University Consortium
Alliance (CNMUCA), an **[academic partnership aimed at [fostering
cooperation]{.mark} [between Norwegian and Chinese
universities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, exemplifies **[Beijing's intent to
integrate into Arctic scientific and technological
networks]{.underline}**. Although details of the consortium are not
widely publicised, it is indicative of **[China's [methodical approach
to enhancing its technical competencies]{.mark} [through bilateral
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Moreover, [Chinese
investments in Norwegian maritime industries signal a deeper alignment
of economic interests]{.underline}. Through acquisitions and joint
ventures, Beijing seeks to access technologies that would otherwise be
unavailable domestically.

Finally, China's launch of the Tan Suo San Hao icebreaking research
vessel in the end of 2024 reflects its possible aspirations to engage
Norway in joint Arctic expeditions. By demonstrating its commitment to
scientific cooperation, Beijing aims to secure Norway's endorsement for
its activities in the region. Such partnerships not only provide access
to valuable data but also support China's claim as a responsible and
capable Arctic stakeholder.

[Promoting a Chinese Model of Ocean Governance]{.underline}

Beneath its scientific and economic initiatives lies a more ambitious
goal: promoting a "Chinese model" of ocean governance. In the Arctic,
[[China advocates for]{.mark} a [governance model that]{.mark}
[accommodates non-Arctic states]{.mark},]{.underline} such as itself,
[[framing]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} [as a global commons]{.mark}
[rather than a domain exclusively controlled by Arctic
Nations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Central to this model is the [[concept of "win-win"
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}, which underscores [China's push for
multilateral frameworks that [emphasise resource-sharing and
collective]{.mark} [development]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, critics
could argue that this approach hides underlying strategic goals,
including securing resource rights and extending political influence. By
promoting its governance model, China seeks not only to legitimise its
Arctic activities but also to counterbalance the overwhelming dominance
of so-called Western powers in the region---this is due to the fact
that, of the eight Arctic states, seven are "Western" nations and NATO
members, Russia being then only one outside this bloc: institutionally,
from a "one country, one vote" perspective, the Arctic is indeed
overwhelmingly "Western", regardless of population size, geographic area
or maritime borders.

[In parallel, [China has employed soft-power initiatives]{.mark} to
[reinforce its vision of inclusive governance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Through [[**cultural exchanges**, **public diplomacy** campaigns]{.mark}
and [**investments** in Arctic states]{.mark}, Beijing has [cultivated a
narrative of mutual benefit]{.mark} and]{.underline} cooperation.
However, this approach has faced resistance, particularly from the
United States and its allies, who view China's Arctic activities as part
of a broader strategy to challenge "Western" hegemony.

Conclusions

[China's [expanding involvement]{.mark} in the Arctic [proves,]{.mark}
once more, its [aspirations to redefine its position]{.mark} [on the
global stage]{.mark}]{.underline}. T[hrough scientific
**[partnerships]{.mark}**, **[infrastructure investments]{.mark}** and
**[diplomatic maneuvering]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [Beijing has firmly
inserted itself within a region of immense strategic
importance]{.underline}. These actions extend beyond resource extraction
and logistical benefits, [[touching on broader themes of influence and
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

By [advocating for a governance framework that accommodates non-Arctic
Nations]{.underline}, [[China]{.mark} is not only [seeking
inclusion]{.mark} but [aiming to shape the rules of]{.mark}
[engagement]{.mark} to reflect its strategic interests]{.underline}.
This approach challenges the dominance of established Arctic states and
tests the boundaries of international cooperation. How China's ambitions
intersect with the sovereignty and priorities of Arctic Nations will
play a defining role in the region's evolution. The unfolding dynamics
in this polar frontier deserve sustained attention from policymakers and
observers worldwide.

#### Brink is now \-\-- Absent Chinese leadership, Arctic Governance falls apart, risking miscalculation that completely destabilizes the region and turns the Arctic into a warzone.

[As climate change and [evolving international dynamics shape]{.mark}
the [Arctic]{.mark}, governance in the [region]{.mark} is [attracting
heightened attention]{.mark} from major global
stakeholders.]{.underline} [**[Arctic governance]{.mark}** is a broad
[concept]{.mark} that [encompasses **political**, **economic**,
**legal**, and **security** dimensions]{.mark}, with the overarching
[goal of]{.mark} fostering [**peace**, **stability**]{.mark}, and
**[sustainable development]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}.
Presently, [Arctic governance faces a range]{.underline} of
[[intertwined risks]{.mark},]{.underline} including
[**[environmental]{.mark}**, **[geopolitical]{.mark}**,
**[legal]{.mark}**, and [**structural** governance
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}, each posing significant obstacles.
Understanding the policies and practices of key Arctic stakeholders is
crucial for discerning trends in governance evolution. Analyzing the
policies and practices of Arctic and non-Arctic states, the European
Union, and non-state actors reveals their significant influence on the
governance landscape. This landscape reflects the interaction between
traditional and non-traditional security concerns. Since the end of the
Cold War, [[Arctic governance]{.mark} has shifted from
"**securitization**" to "**desecuritization**," with a [recent]{.mark}
trend toward "**[re-securitization]{.mark}**," highlighting a
[renewed]{.mark} [focus]{.mark} [on security
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context, the [[fragmented]{.mark}
nature of Arctic [governance]{.mark} mechanisms is likely to give rise
to a multi-level, multi-nodal heterarchy model]{.underline}. The
traditional Arctic [governance framework will be deconstructed by
increasingly diverse, dynamic, and interdependent governance
patterns]{.underline}. Given the constraints of strategic resource
misallocation, the harshness of the geographical environment, and
institutional limitations, [[geopolitical competition]{.mark} in the
Arctic [remains]{.mark} inherently [constrained]{.mark},]{.underline}
which [[reduces]{.mark} the likelihood of [conventional
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the [potential [risks associated
with hybrid warfare are growing]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this situation,
all Arctic stakeholders should actively fulfill their responsibilities,
enhance dialogue and consultation, fully respect the legitimate
interests of all parties, and work collectively toward a more stable and
cooperative Arctic governance framework.

**[[China's interests]{.mark} and activities [in the Arctic]{.mark} are
[not]{.mark} inherently [illegitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Academics,
strategic analysts, journalists, and pundits continue to debate the
underlying motives and long-term desires behind China's growing Arctic
investments. In its 2018 Arctic White Paper, **[[Beijing]{.mark}
articulated its [entirely reasonable interest]{.mark} [in polar]{.mark}
research and science (]{.underline}**particularly relating to climate
change), as well as vested interests in natural resources and
prospective Arctic shipping routes (which are to be expected from a
resource-hungry country dependent upon maritime commerce). Furthermore,
[Beijing's [participation in regional governance]{.mark} fora befit a
rising global power [aspiring to enhance]{.mark} its status and
[influence in]{.mark} [international affairs]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Western commentators' tendency toward outrage or alarm at China's
interests in Arctic resources and shipping routes is understandable
given Beijing's broader challenge to the rules-based international
order, but many of these warnings imply that China should not act out of
rational state self-interest. [These [Western assertions]{.mark}---that
China should simply stay out of the region---also [fail to]{.mark}
[acknowledge that country's legitimate]{.mark}---versus
undesirable---[interests]{.mark} in Arctic affairs]{.underline}, and by
extension those of other non-Arctic states. When Western commentators
highlight the primacy of upholding the rules-based order, they must also
extend rights within that order to competitors like China.

bryce

What grand future had Beijing planned for itself in the Arctic? [Leaving
aside the massively overblown claims that [**China** has committed
itself to dominating the region]{.mark}, aspiring to become the **Arctic
superpower**, there is little doubt that Beijing has [long aspired to
become]{.mark} a [major player in]{.mark} the **[high
north]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Climate change and the [[shrinking of the polar ice cap]{.mark} have
[transformed]{.mark} the [Arctic into what China]{.mark} officially
[classifies as]{.mark} one of the world's "**[new strategic
frontiers]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} a [space ripe with [new opportunities
to extract natural resources]{.mark}]{.underline} (oil, gas, rare earth
elements and even fish), [[to invest in infra]{.mark}structure and to
[develop new and more]{.mark} [secure shipping
routes]{.mark}]{.underline} (the Northern Sea Route and the Transpolar
Sea Route).

So it is perhaps unsurprising that China would have developed an
ambitious vision of itself as a "near-Arctic" power, perhaps even a
"polar great power," over the past decade or so. [But what was
[China]{.mark}'s [Arctic strategy]{.mark}? Answers can be found in
statements such as China's 2018 White Paper, various speeches delivered
by President Xi Jinping and senior Chinese officials with responsibility
for Arctic policy,]{.underline} and a number of People's Liberation Army
military publications.

[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [plan was to [become a polar great
power]{.mark} by building on China's record of scientific
diplomacy]{.underline}. While outwardly promoting the pursuit of
scientific research for the common good, China's prominent scientific
figures, and high-level members of the Chinese Communist Party, asserted
that scientific endeavors are also driven by the desire to assert a
"right to speak" about Arctic affairs, to cultivate China's identity as
an Arctic stakeholder, and to ensure access to strategic resources.

[[Second,]{.mark} the plan envisioned an [intensification of regional
economic partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beijing sought to enhance
its access to Arctic economic resources by investing in a wide range of
onshore mining, offshore oil exploration and extraction, and
infrastructure development projects.

[[Third]{.mark}, Beijing saw [enhanced participation in regional
governance initiatives]{.mark} as a key element of its Arctic
strategy]{.underline}. It aspired both to play a larger role within
existing institutions, like the Arctic Council and various Track II
forums, and to create alternative Chinese governance mechanisms ---
including the "Polar Silk Road," the China-Russia Arctic Forum and the
China-Nordic Arctic Research Center --- to complement, or even
transcend, existing institutions.

[[Fourth]{.mark}, without sovereign jurisdiction in the region, Chinese
leaders pursued [cooperation with Russia]{.mark} in the economic and
governance fields]{.underline}. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin released a
joint statement mere weeks before Russia attacked Ukraine proclaiming a
"no limits" partnership that included "practical cooperation for the
sustainable development of the Arctic" and the further opening of
bilateral Arctic maritime commerce.

[[Finally, China's Arctic strategy]{.mark} potentially [involves]{.mark}

But all revolves around power interplay and assertiveness of global
actors. While economic opportunities are at the forefront of China's
Arctic ambitions, strategic considerations also play a significant role.
Xi Jinping's administration views the Arctic as an emerging frontier in
global geopolitics, where the balance of power is shifting as ice melts
and previously inaccessible regions become open to exploration (Xinhua,
2018).

[[China's growing presence in the Arctic]{.mark} is also [tied
to]{.mark} its [broader global strategy of exerting]{.mark} its
[influence]{.mark} in key regions]{.underline}. The Arctic offers China
a [platform to **[demonstrate its global strength]{.mark}**, both
[in]{.mark} terms of [scientific research]{.mark} as well as in
[environmental care]{.mark}]{.underline}. China has [invested heavily in
Arctic scientific research]{.underline} (Fernandes & Duarte, 2023),
establishing research stations in the region and conducting [regular
icebreaker missions to study the effects of climate change,]{.underline}
monitor resource deposits, and explore new technologies for Arctic
exploration. The Xuelong (Snow Dragon), China's state-of-the-art
icebreaker, regularly conducts missions to map the Arctic seabed and
assess the feasibility of resource extraction. This [[scientific
engagement serves]{.mark}]{.underline} both as a means of gaining
expertise in Arctic operations and [[as a diplomatic tool to legitimise
China's growing role in the]{.mark} [region]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Tillman et al., 2018).

China's strategic ambitions in the Arctic also extend to security
concerns. [While [China **has not militarised its Arctic**]{.mark}
**[presence]{.mark}**, it is [closely watching the growing
militarization of the region]{.mark} by other major powers, particularly
Russia.]{.underline} As the Arctic becomes more accessible, [the
potential for resource conflicts and territorial disputes increases, and
China is keen on ensuring that it has a voice in any future governance
structures that emerge.]{.underline} China has advocated for a peaceful,
cooperative approach to Arctic governance, often aligning with
international legal frameworks such as the UNCLOS (Woon, 2020).
However[, [China's long-term strategic goals in the Arctic **remain
ambiguous**]{.underline}]{.mark}, with some analysts suggesting that its
economic and scientific engagement could lay the groundwork for a future
military presence.

#### China is not interested in militarizing the arctic now

[On the contrary, the Chinese researcher Deng Beixi believes that
**[China does not aim to revise the existing Arctic order and does not
project its military power into the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[26\]. China is least of all [[interested in building]{.mark} its
military potential in the Arctic]{.underline}, but not only because of
the logic of mutual nuclear deterrence, which China has always reckoned
with, since [[a stable and peaceful Arctic]{.mark} today meets China\'s
interests.]{.underline} It is in such conditions that the possibility of
a peaceful and stable use of the Northern Sea Route will be kept. It
should also be noted that [[cooperation between China and Russia]{.mark}
in the Arctic [does not imply an increase in military power]{.mark} in
the region.]{.underline} For example, the [[holding of joint naval
training]{.underline}]{.mark} of Russia and China near the territorial
waters of the US in Alaska was rather a consequence of the activities of
the US in the South China Sea, and [[did not]{.mark} [reflect China\'s
strategic]{.mark} or military-political [ambitions in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some evidence suggests that the [[PRC military is thinking about how to
approach]{.mark} future [operations in the]{.mark}
[Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} The 2015 and 2020 editions of Science of
Military Strategy, a volume published by the Chinese Academy of Military
Sciences, each devote an entire section to polar issues. The 2020
edition describes the polar regions as "an important direction in the
expansion of our country's interests overseas" that creates "new tasks
and missions" for the PLA. It offers the following "strategic guidance"
for employing forces in the polar regions:

[[• Military operations in the polar regions must serve the
PRC's]{.mark} overall [foreign policies]{.mark} and
[strategies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Noting that polar activities "touch on
complex and strict international treaty obligations" and "sensitive
international politics"---especially in the Arctic---the authors advise
that military operations in the polar regions must be preceded by
"integrated planning and preparation." [This planning and preparation
should [include coordination between the]{.mark} [diplomatic,
commercial, and scientific sectors]{.mark} and relevant
departments]{.underline} to "ensure that the use of polar military
forces is conducted under the country's overall strategy."

[[Military operations]{.mark} in the polar regions should [adhere to a
"military-civilian hybrid" model]{.mark}.]{.underline} The authors
advise "closely combining military and civilian forces," using the PLA
to "support polar scientific observation and other operations" and
"actively provide equipment, technology, and medical support." As the
PLA's ability to project power over long distances increases, the
authors recommend "considering using large transport aircraft and
military support boats, and special surface transportation vehicles to
provide logistics support for national polar scientific research."

• [Military operations in the polar regions [should focus on **"polar
rescue and military operations**]{.mark} **[other than
war."]{.mark}**]{.underline} The authors advise ["[strengthening
capabilities]{.mark} like polar [situational awareness]{.mark} and
monitoring; [communications]{.mark}, air, sea, and land mobility in
polar climates]{.underline}; and specialized rescue" with the goal of
developing the capability to rapidly and effectively conduct rescue
operations.

[• The [military]{.mark} should [actively explore **international
cooperation**]{.mark} in the polar regions]{.underline}. The authors
emphasize the importance of military diplomacy. [They advise that the
PLA, when supporting scientific missions, should "[maintain an active
and open posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, and broadly [develop coordination
and cooperation]{.underline} with the civilian and military forces of
other countries."52

[[China's incursions in the Arctic must be understood]{.mark} both [in
light with the country's domestic needs]{.mark} as well as its foreign
policy.]{.underline} Interestingly, in addition to the development of
infrastructures, there is a whole logic of political survival,
accompanied by an economic overcapacity and concomitant search for new
markets, as well as a growing Chinese middle class, which can afford
today to have a more diversified diet. But as or more important than
these factors, nowadays' [[China has a growing need for energy]{.mark}
on a planet where resources are increasingly scarce. Bearing this in
mind, [China has traditionally invested in]{.mark} remote
regions,]{.underline} much based on the belief that the greater the
risk, the greater the opportunity. Therefore, as we shall see later,
[[countries like Iceland or]{.mark} regions like [Greenland]{.mark} make
perfect sense [in the context of]{.mark} a possible **[Polar Silk
Road,]{.mark}** as they are endowed [with]{.mark} **[abundant food and
energy resources]{.mark}.**]{.underline} On the other hand, the presence
of competitors in these regions is not (yet) significant. Indeed, given
the lack of infrastructure, including rescue services, as well as the
need for state-of-the-art technology (with high costs) to explore icy
waters, many investors successively postpone ambitious projects in these
regions of the High North[. However, China recognizes that both its
demographic and energy future requires building and consolidating a
presence in the region.]{.underline} Indeed, Chinese political leaders
and executives are aware that the melting of ice is likely to provide
extraordinary opportunities for their country (ibidem).

[[If]{.mark} the [West and Russia cannot manage]{.mark} their

Sea Region, Eastern Europe, and Baltic Sea Region leading to
ever-escalating sanctions and countersanctions, it will make

the [direction of]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} [bounded
order]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kissinger, 2014; Mearsheimer, 2014, 2019).

If the West does not want to push Russia in the direction of the Chinese
bounded order, the [[West must]{.mark} [take into account]{.mark}
broader [Russian strategic stability concerns]{.mark}, including
domestic political stability in Russian society]{.underline} (Chivvis et
al., 2017). Such [accommodation will require]{.underline} Western
compromise on imposing liberal values and [making them a condition for
dialogue and cooperation]{.underline} (the West already compromises on
these values when it comes to partner or client regimes in, e.g., the
Middle East).

For the Arctic, [this [scenario may present]{.mark}]{.underline} the
following consequences. Either the Arctic order will be less circumpolar
with a clearer US-dominated Nordic and North American Arctic and a
Russian Arctic with extensive Chinese investments. Or a circumpolar
Arctic order will be preserved, but with less emphasis on liberal topics
that interfere in Russian domestic political economy and [more [concern

The Donald [[Trump administration]{.underline}]{.mark} reportedly
[[plans to terminate U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}. financial [[support to
Gavi]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [global [initiative to]{.mark}]{.underline}
purchase and distribute [[vaccines]{.mark} that has
immunized]{.underline} more than [1
billion](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/vaccine-alliance-reaches-more-one-billion-children) [children]{.underline}
since its launch in 2000.  

The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates is one
of [Gavi\'s]{.underline} six original donor nations and currently the
initiative\'s third largest [contributor,
[providing]{.mark}]{.underline} more than [[[12% of
funding]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-gavi-the-vaccine-alliance/).
The U.S. government commits these funds through multiyear pledges, which
Congress then appropriates on an annual timeline. If the administration
goes through with the plan, it will axe a U.S. grant providing [\$2.6
billion through
2030,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/26/usaid-cuts-gavi-vaccines-trump/) more
than half of which has yet to be obligated to Gavi.  

Although Secretary of State Marco [Rubio announced]{.underline} [in
March](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/secretary-of-state-rubio-says-purge-of-usaid-programs-complete-with-more-than-80-of-agencys-programs-gone) [that]{.underline}
the [administration had finalized its review]{.underline} of foreign aid
projects, the decision to discontinue Gavi's funding could still change,
as [federal officials move toward implementation]{.underline} and thanks
to future opportunities for the United States to contribute to Gavi\'s
multiyear [replenishment](https://www.devex.com/news/gavi-delays-9b-replenishment-event-amid-tough-fundraising-environment-109597) cycles.
But [[if]{.mark} the [administration does]{.mark} not change course,
Gavi will face]{.underline} considerable [challenges]{.underline} as it
tries to stretch its budget. 

The [[loss of U.S. funding]{.underline}]{.mark} could leave Gavi with
three options to downsize its operations: drop funding the supply of
vaccines to some recipient countries, reduce the number of vaccines the
initiative supports, or reduce funding for vaccine and health systems
development. All of these routes [[could]{.underline}]{.mark}
significantly [[alter]{.mark} the [health]{.mark} and lifespans
[of]{.mark} nearly [100 million children]{.mark}]{.underline} and
teenagers worldwide.  

[[By retreating]{.underline}]{.mark} from its commitments to Gavi, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[opens]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[door for China to expand]{.mark} its
[influence]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the global [[vaccine market
through]{.mark} its foreign [loans, aid programs, and vaccine
suppliers]{.mark}. This approach]{.underline} could [mirror [China\'s
vaccine diplomacy during COVID-19, when it provided vaccines]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} many low- or middle-income countries
[([LMICs]{.mark}) that faced barriers to access.]{.underline} 

Which Countries Could Be Affected? [Gavi targets]{.underline} its [aid
to the world\'s poorest]{.underline}, supporting only
[countries]{.underline} with a recent [gross national
income](https://www.gavi.org/types-support/sustainability/eligibility) (GNI)
per capita below or equal to \$1,820. [Gavi's [financing
model](https://immunizationeconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BRIEF9.pdf) buys
and procures vaccines in partnership with low-income
countries]{.underline}, increasing its cofinancing levels as national
income levels grow. Once a nation is rich enough to become ineligible,
it enters an accelerated transition phase, a five-year period where the
country boosts its vaccine spending until it is fully self-financing.

Of the 54 countries [eligible for Gavi\'s
support](https://www.gavi.org/types-support/sustainability/eligibility),
11 qualify for the accelerated transition program, and this [subset
faces the biggest fallout from the U.S. decision to stop
funding]{.underline}.[[If]{.mark} these [LMICs]{.mark}
[lose]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[capacity to bankroll]{.mark} multiple
[vaccines simultaneously]{.mark}]{.underline} because of Gavi\'s
defunding, [a [viable alternative]{.mark} would be to [turn to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}---[for loans, foreign aid, and the highly
concessional prices that]{.underline} its [vaccine suppliers could
offer]{.underline}. Since 2000, [China has provided more than \$89
billion]{.underline} in cumulative development [assistance to these
nations]{.underline}, all of which are members of its Belt and Road
Initiative. Approximately \$1 billion of this total---just over 1%---has
been allocated to health assistance. These [[countries are already
within]{.mark} the strategic [focus of China\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}
broader [[foreign influence strategy, including]{.underline}]{.mark} in

Emerging pathogens

[Although we are made up of **human [cells]{.mark}**]{.underline}, we
[**have almost [ten times]{.mark}** [that of **bacteria**]{.mark} just
**in our guts** and **more on** our **skin**]{.underline}. These
[microbes]{.underline} not only affect locally but also
[**[affect]{.mark}** the **[entire body]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is
a [**balance between the good** and **bad bacteria**]{.underline}, and
any [**change in the environment** may **cause** this **balance to
shift**]{.underline}, especially on the skin, the consequences of which
are unknown.

Although most bacteria on and inside of us are harmless, [**gut
bacteria** can also **have [viruses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If viruses
don't [**[kill]{.mark}** the **bacteria
[immediately]{.mark}**]{.underline}, they can [**[incorporate
into]{.mark} the** **bacterial [genome]{.mark}** and **[stay
latent]{.mark}** for a long time **until reactivation** by environmental
factor]{.underline}s, when they can [become
**[pathogenic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They can also [**escape from the
gut** and **enter other organs** or the **bloodstream**]{.underline}.
Bacteria can then use these viruses to kill other bacteria or help them
[**evolve to** more **virulent strains**]{.underline}.

An example of the evolution of pathogens is the cause of the current
pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
[coronavirus]{.underline} 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several
**[[mutations]{.underline}]{.mark}** are now known that [**[make]{.mark}
the virus [more infectious]{.mark}** and **[resistant to immune
responses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and strengthening its to enter cells
via surface receptors.

The brain

There is evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 can also [**[affect]{.mark}** the
**[brain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The virus may enter the brain via the
olfactory tract or through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
pathway. [**Viruses can** also **affect** our **[senses]{.mark}**, such
as a loss of **smell and taste**, and there could be **[other]{.mark}**
so far unkown **[neurological effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The loss
of smell seen in COVID-19 could be a [**[new viral syndrome]{.mark}**
specific to this disease]{.underline}.

Many books and movies have described pandemics caused by pathogens that
wipe out large populations and cause severe diseases. In the essay, the
author provides a hypothetical scenario where a gut bacteria suddenly
starts producing viral proteins. Some virions spread through the body
and get transmitted through the human population. After a few months,
the virus started causing blindness, and within a year, large
populations lost their vision.

[**[Pandemics]{.mark} can** cause other diseases that [can **threaten
humanity's**]{.mark} **entire [existence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
COVID-19 pandemic brought this possibility to the forefront. If [we
continue disturbing the equilibrium between us and the
environment,]{.underline} we [don't know what the consequences may be
and]{.underline} the next pandemic could [[lead]{.mark} us [to
**extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### U---US Withdrawal

#### US backed out of the WHO, China has now taken key leadership to Global Heath and Pandemic Support

The 78th [[World Health Assembly]{.mark} in Geneva]{.underline} this May
[[marked a turning point]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in global health
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the [[first time since]{.mark} the
[founding of]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**orld
[[H]{.underline}]{.mark}ealth [[O]{.underline}]{.mark}rganization, the
[[U.S.]{.mark} was both financially and diplomatically
[absent]{.mark}]{.underline}. It sent no senior officials and [has
withdrawn all funding]{.underline}, [with little indication of
re-engagement.]{.underline} Meanwhile, **[[China arrived in full
force]{.mark}: a greater presence, a louder voice and significantly more
funding.]{.underline}** If fulfilled, its [\$500 million pledge now
makes it the largest state donor to the WHO,]{.underline} and it brought
the largest-ever WHA delegation in history. It also embedded its
national interests across key technical tracks, side events and
diplomatic meetings. Most headlines have focused on a simple narrative:
that China is stepping into a space left by the U.S. But this framing is
misleading. China has never sought to replicate the Western models of
public goods and technical neutrality. Its approach favors
sovereignty-first bilateral cooperation and institutional leverage, and
its engagement in global health has always followed a different logic,
folded into trade, infrastructure, diplomacy and power, delivered
through a mix of public and private mechanisms. The WHA is where 194
member states discuss and vote on resolutions, funding decisions and
treaty endorsements to set out the direction of global health for years
to come. This year, China used the opportunity to articulate specific
priorities, amplify preferred narratives and consolidate its position
across key technical domains. This is selective multilateralism:
cooperation, but only where it pays off. Alongside a 180-strong
delegation spanning senior officials from multiple ministries,
state-owned firms and diplomatic staff, and led by Vice Premier Liu
Guozhong and Health Minister Lei Haichao, China\'s \$500 million pledge
over five years now places it ahead of all other state donors to the
WHO. Still, given China\'s economic size and geopolitical aspirations,
the figure may appear modest. And unlike traditional U.S. funding, this
mix of increased assessed dues, earmarked project contributions and
South-South development funds is tied to specific mechanisms, many of
which intersect with China\'s bilateral financing platforms. This year,
the [[WHO]{.mark} repeatedly and publicly [signaled]{.mark}
institutional [endorsement for China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
mattered. The relationship between Beijing and the WHO has been uneven
in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among
leaders who highlighted China\'s contributions in key areas was
Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who stated, \"[[China has
made strong contributions to global public health]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
to the [work of WHO]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" These [[leaders endorsed new
cooperation]{.mark} agreements and **[described China\'s role]{.mark} as
[central]{.mark} to the organization\'s future direction**.]{.underline}
The [recognition reinforced China\'s positioning as a responsible actor,
and increasingly, a standard-setter, in global health
governance]{.underline}. A [major [output]{.mark} of the gathering
[was]{.mark} the [Pandemic Agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, finally
[adopted]{.underline} in diluted form [[after]{.mark} three years of
[negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The framework [aims to strengthen
preparedness, surveillance and equitable access.]{.underline} China
supported the final text but emphasized national sovereignty, digital
security and protections for developing countries. The red lines were
clear. With greater WHO funding and visibility, [[China]{.mark} also
[deployed]{.mark} its institutional [influence]{.mark} in other
areas]{.underline}. After all, it views [multilateralism as a strategic
tool to entrench its worldview]{.underline}. Taiwan\'s long-standing bid
for WHA observer status was again removed from the agenda during a
closed-door committee vote. A Chinese representative stated that
\"Taiwan\'s participation in the WHA must be handled in strict
accordance with the \'One China\' principle,\" while state media
described the outcome as both a legal necessity and a diplomatic
success. A well-recognized function of the annual WHA is that of
performance. Countries use side events, technical roundtables and joint
forums to showcase systems they believe are globally exportable. [China
seized this opportunity to promote]{.underline} carefully selected areas
of strength, [particularly in under-addressed WHO priorities like mental
health and rare diseases]{.underline}, where it can [demonstrate both
policy leadership and implementation capacity]{.underline}. [A
[roundtable]{.mark}]{.underline} on \"Empowering Primary Health Care
with Digital Intelligence\" [[brought]{.mark} significant
[credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. Digital health is a global topic with
bipartisan excitement and minimal geopolitical baggage, and this [event
[showcased China\'s national]{.mark} digital [health
infrastructur]{.mark}e]{.underline}, from AI-supported diagnosis and
smart hospital pathways to integrated digital payment systems. The forum
was pitched as a replicable solution for lower- and middle-income
countries, complete with policy templates and implementation guidance.
Over 200 delegates attended, with more queuing outside: a rare sight at
WHA. This year also featured the first WHA side event dedicated to
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Co-hosted with Asian and African
partners, the forum presented TCM clinical research centers, harmonized
pharmacopoeia and standardized products for global export. The event
marked a notable step forward in repositioning TCM, which has long been
a political priority for China, as not just soft power, but as a
formally recognized component of global health architecture previously
hotly contested by some (particularly Western) member states. Alongside
its public-facing pledges and formal speeches, [[China]{.mark} also [ran
bilateral diplomacy]{.mark} [in parallel]{.mark}.]{.underline} It met
with Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Tunisia and Morocco [[to advance
cooperation]{.mark} on research]{.underline}, talent pipelines and
disease surveillance. Crucially, these [[engagements were not positioned
within WHO frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark}, but framed under Beijing\'s
own initiatives: the Global Development Initiative, the Global
Civilization Initiative and the Health Silk Road. This year\'s
[[W]{.mark}orld [H]{.mark}ealth [A]{.mark}ssembly [offered one of the
clearest views]{.mark} yet of how China plans to operationalize its
\"selective multilateralism]{.underline}\" approach to global health.
Distinct from ambiguous slow-moving Western models, [Beijing is building
a development ecosystem where health becomes a channel for
trust-building in Chinese vaccines, AI systems and TCM
products.]{.underline} It supports sovereignty-first positions across
data governance, drug regulation and digital norms. It also promotes
bilateral diplomacy that blurs the boundaries between health,
development and foreign policy. Some traditionalists remain uneasy with
this shift, but it is not hard to see why many lower- and middle-income
countries are turning toward China. Faced with shrinking Western aid and
uncertain alliances, Beijing\'s model offers speed, infrastructure and a
high degree of political alignment. WHA78 may not have resolved the
major structural divides in global health, but it did show that China is
moving decisively, on its own terms.

[[China]{.mark} is [expected to make]{.mark} more [contributions
to]{.mark} global [containment]{.mark} of COVID-19 by developing
vaccines [through international cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline},
leading international public health experts said. [[Having effectively

[strengthen global health]{.mark}]{.underline} systems [[and
improve]{.mark} global [preparedness]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the next [public [health
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, Seth Berkley, [[CEO of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [Global [Alliance for Vaccines]{.mark} and Immunizations,
said]{.underline} at a seminar last week. \"[[China]{.mark} has
[done]{.mark} a [remarkable]{.mark} job [on COVID-19]{.mark}
control]{.underline}. From my perspective, [it\'s]{.underline} been
[really [extraordinary]{.mark} [to see a country]{.mark} hit
by]{.underline} a severe [epidemic]{.underline} to [[respond so
quickly]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he said. \"[[China]{.mark} tried to
slow]{.underline} this [disease]{.underline} down, not just for China

[[Xi]{.mark}\'s recognition of]{.underline} the [importance
of]{.underline} preparedness, including the importance of vaccine
stockpiles, and obviously want to see [[increased cooperation
globally]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Richard Hatchett, CEO of Coalition for
Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said many [[Chinese companies and
institutes]{.mark} are [developing vaccines]{.mark} [for
COVID-19]{.mark}]{.underline} with government support, and some are
under clinical trials already. But with reduced COVID-19 cases in China
due to its containment, [domestic vaccine developers]{.underline} may
[need international collaboration so]{.underline} further clinical
[trials]{.underline} [can be conducted in]{.underline} other
[countries]{.underline}, he said, adding some [[Chinese companies have
shown interest]{.mark} [in international collaboration]{.mark} in
developing vaccines]{.underline} for the disease. Berkley said the
organization will continue to work with China in the development of
vaccines to contribute to containment of the pandemic globally. \"We
want to continue to work on bringing Chinese science and vaccine
manufacturers to the world, trying to make sure the quality is there and
that China can work through the thicket of international regulations to
have pre-qualified products is going to be critical,\" he said. Yinuo
Li, director of the Gates Foundation China, said vaccines will play a
key role in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, and
international cooperation will be key in successful research and
development of such vaccines. \"[[China has world-class vaccine research
and development teams, and vaccine manufacturing and public health
system building in China has made great progress over the past

The Challenge: Multiple Existential Threats

The relationship between pandemics and war is as long as human history.
Past **[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}** have **[[set]{.mark} the
[scene for wars]{.mark} by weakening societies, undermining resilience,
and exacerbating civil and inter-state conflict]{.underline}**. Other
disease outbreaks have erupted during wars, in part due to the appalling
public health and battlefield conditions resulting from war, in turn
sowing the seeds for new conflicts. In the post-Cold War era,
**[pandemics]{.underline}** have **[[spread with]{.mark} unprecedented
[speed due to]{.mark} increased [mobility]{.mark} created by
globalization]{.underline}**, especially between urbanized areas.
Although there are positive signs that scientific advances and rapid
innovation can help us manage pandemics, **[it is likely that deadly
infectious viruses will be a challenge for years to come]{.underline}**.

The COVID-19 is the most demonic pandemic threat in modern history. It
has erupted at a juncture of other existential global threats, most
importantly, accelerating climate change and resurgent nuclear
threat-making. The most important issue, therefore, is how the
coronavirus (and future pandemics) will increase or decrease the risks
associated with these twin threats, climate change effects, and the next
use of nuclear weapons in war.5

Today, the nine **[nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** arsenals not
only **[can]{.underline}** annihilate hundreds of cities, but also
**[[cause]{.mark} nuclear [winter and]{.mark} mass [starvation
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** a billion or more people, if not **[[the
entire]{.mark} human [species]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Concurrently,
climate change is enveloping the planet with more frequent and intense
storms, accelerating sea level rise, and advancing rapid ecological
change, expressed in unprecedented forest fires across the world.
Already stretched to a breaking point in many countries, the current
pandemic may overcome resilience to the point of near or actual collapse
of social, economic, and political order.

In this extraordinary moment, it is timely to reflect on the existence
and possible uses of weapons of mass destruction under pandemic
conditions -- most importantly, nuclear weapons, but also chemical and
biological weapons. **[Moments of extreme [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and vulnerability **[can [prompt aggressive]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
counterintuitive **[[actions that]{.mark} in turn may
[destabilize]{.mark} already precariously [balanced]{.mark} threat
[systems, underpinned by]{.mark} conventional and [nuclear weapons, as
well as]{.mark} the threat of weaponized [chemical and
bio]{.mark}logical [tech]{.mark}nologies.]{.underline}**
**[Consequently, the [risk]{.mark} of the use of]{.underline}** weapons
of mass destruction **[(WMD),]{.underline}** especially nuclear weapons,
**[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark}** at such times, possibly
**[[sharply]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The COVID-19 pandemic is clearly driving massive, rapid, and
unpredictable changes that will redefine every aspect of the human
condition, including WMD -- just as the world wars of the first half of
the 20th century led to a revolution in international affairs and
entirely new ways of organizing societies, economies, and international
relations, in part based on nuclear weapons and their threatened use. In
a world reshaped by pandemics, nuclear weapons -- as well as correlated
non-nuclear WMD, nuclear alliances, "deterrence" doctrines, operational
and declaratory policies, nuclear extended deterrence, organizational
practices, and the existential risks posed by retaining these
capabilities -- are all up for redefinition.

**[[A pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}** has potential to **[destabilize a
nuclear-prone conflict by incapacitating]{.underline}** the supreme
nuclear commander or **[commanders who have to issue nuclear strike
orders, [creat]{.mark}ing uncertainty]{.underline}** as to who is in
charge, how to handle nuclear mistakes (such **[a]{.underline}**s
errors, **[[accidents]{.underline}]{.mark}**, technological failures,
and entanglement with conventional operations gone awry),
**[[and]{.mark} opening a brief [opportunity for]{.mark} a [first
strike]{.mark}]{.underline}** at a time when the COVID-infected state
may not be able to retaliate efficiently -- or at all -- due to
leadership confusion. In some nuclear-laden conflicts, **[a state might
use a pandemic [as a cover]{.mark} for]{.underline}** political or
**[military provocations]{.underline}** in the belief that the adversary
is distracted and partly disabled by the pandemic, increasing the risk
of war in a nuclear-prone conflict. At the same time, **[a pandemic may
lead nuclear armed states to increase the isolation and sanctions
against a nuclear adversary]{.underline}**, making it even harder to
stop the spread of the disease, in turn creating a pandemic reservoir
and transmission risk back to the nuclear armed state or its allies.

In principle, the common threat of the pandemic might induce
nuclear-armed states to reduce the tension in a nuclear-prone conflict
and thereby the risk of nuclear war. It may cause nuclear adversaries or
their umbrella states to seek to resolve conflicts in a cooperative and
collaborative manner by creating habits of communication, engagement,
and mutual learning that come into play in the nuclear-military sphere.
For example, militaries may cooperate to control pandemic transmission,
including by working together against criminal-terrorist non-state
actors that are trafficking people or by joining forces to ensure that a
new pathogen is not developed as a bioweapon.

To date, however, **[the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the
isolation]{.underline}** of some nuclear-armed states and provided a
textbook case of the failure of states to cooperate to overcome the
pandemic. **[[Borders]{.underline}]{.mark}** have **[[slammed]{.mark}
shut, [trade]{.mark} shut down]{.underline}**, **[[and budgets
blown]{.mark} out]{.underline}**, creating enormous pressure to focus on
immediate domestic priorities. **[Foreign [policies]{.mark} have
[become]{.mark} markedly more [nationalistic]{.mark}. Dependence on
nuclear weapons may increase]{.underline}** as states seek to buttress a
global re-spatialization6 of all dimensions of human interaction at all
levels to manage pandemics. The effect of nuclear threats on leaders may
make it less likely -- or even impossible -- to achieve the kind of
concert at a global level needed to respond to and administer an
effective vaccine, making it harder and even impossible to revert to
pre-pandemic international relations. **[The result is that some states
may proliferate their own nuclear weapons, further reinforcing the
spiral of conflicts]{.underline}** contained by nuclear threat, **[[with
cascading]{.mark} effects on the [risk of]{.mark} nuclear
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

harm]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as in long COVID (Misra 2021),
**[could [result in]{.mark} the human population having [insufficient
cognitive fitness to maintain civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, **[these sorts of effects [could]{.mark} have
[occurr]{.mark}ed during pandemics earlier in human history [without
leaving a]{.mark} noticeable [trace]{.mark}. Supply chain disruptions
would have been of minimal consequence for most of human
history]{.underline}**. Medical effects such as neurological harm could
go away, for example, if it is not passed to subsequent generations. If
w(cc) is large, the potential effects of pandemics on civilization
collapse merit careful scrutiny.

**[[Chinese status-building]{.mark} through the lens of the SIT [does

**[[China]{.mark} through reframing the system of values and criteria
[aims to be part of the in-group]{.mark} as those [that exert influence
in]{.mark} the [regional governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Chinese
discourse develops around the effects of the Arctic's fast-changing

Science and scientific cooperation are proposed and advanced as assets
to go beyond the dichotomy of Arctic and non-Arctic states and
envisioned as tools used by Chinese officials and Chinese academics to
tie the concept of a near-arctic state to the globality of climate
change effects. Employing SIT when looking at China's Arctic strategy is
in line with Larson's perspective (2015) about **[[China not]{.mark}

# Aff---China Soft Power 

## Uniqueness

### U O/W L---China Soft Power Inevitable

#### Chinese soft power rise and U.S soft power decline is inevitable.

**Bi 25** (Jianlu Bi \[Doctoral degree in communication studies and a

Advances While U.S. Retreats, 3-11-2025,
https://fpif.org/soft-power-divide-china-advances-while-u-s-retreats///phs-DZ)

The **[global landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, a
tectonic shift in the balance of influence. The sixth annual Global Soft
Power Index, released by Brand Finance, confirms what many have
observed: [China]{.mark} has [ascended to]{.mark} the
world's [second]{.mark} most influential [soft power nation]{.mark},
trailing only the United States.]{.underline}**

**[This [achievement]{.mark}, coinciding with contrasting political
pronouncements from Beijing and Washington, underscores [a pivotal
moment]{.mark} in international relations. While [China's
Premier]{.mark} Li Qiang [outlines ]{.mark}a vision of [openness and
engagement]{.mark}, U.S. president Donald [Trump]{.mark} champions [a
retreat]{.mark} into isolationism. This divergence presents a fertile
ground for China's soft power to flourish, filling the perceived vacuum
left by a receding American presence.]{.underline}**

**[[China's ascent]{.mark} is [not]{.mark} a [sudden]{.mark} phenomenon;
[it is]{.mark} the [culmination of]{.mark} a deliberate, multi-faceted
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unlike the hard power dominance of
military might and economic coercion, **[soft power relies on attraction
and persuasion, on shaping perceptions and influencing preferences.
[China]{.mark} has meticulously [cultivated ]{.mark}its [soft power
through]{.mark} a diverse array of [cultural, tech]{.mark}nological[,
and diplomatic initiatives.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[At the [heart of]{.mark} China's [soft power]{.mark} strategy [lies
its]{.mark} burgeoning [cultural industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Chinese films, once confined to domestic audiences, are now garnering
international acclaim. Blockbusters like *Ne Zha 2* and the
international buzz surrounding *Black Myth: Wukong* demonstrate China's
growing prowess in animation and gaming, industries that resonate
strongly with younger generations worldwide. The global success of
Chinese dramas and historical series on streaming platforms underscores
the universal appeal of compelling storytelling.

Beyond cinema and gaming, **[[China's digital platforms]{.mark} are
[reshap]{.mark}ing global [communication]{.mark}]{.underline}**. TikTok,
with its viral content and trendsetting influence, has become a cultural
phenomenon, particularly among young people. Xiaohongshu, **[a lifestyle
and e-commerce platform, is [attracting ]{.mark}a [growing user base in
the West,]{.mark} showcasing Chinese trends and consumer culture. These
[platforms]{.mark}, while raising concerns about data privacy and
censorship, [serve as]{.mark} powerful [conduits for]{.mark} cultural
exchange and [soft power projection.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The [promotion of]{.mark} the Chinese [language and culture]{.mark}
is another [cornerstone of]{.mark} China's [soft power
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Confucius Institutes, despite facing
scrutiny in some countries, have played a significant role in
disseminating Mandarin language education and cultural awareness.
**[Online language learning platforms and educational programs are
further expanding access to Chinese language and culture, fostering a
deeper understanding of China among global audiences.]{.underline}**

**[China's [tech]{.mark}nological [advancements]{.mark} are
also [contributing to]{.mark} its [soft power.]{.mark} The country's
[rapid development in]{.mark} areas like [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, [renewable energy, and telecomm]{.mark}unications
has [positioned it as]{.mark} a global [leader in
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, companies like DeepSeek
are making significant strides in developing advanced AI models,
showcasing China's growing capabilities in cutting-edge technology.
DeepSeek's progress in areas like large language models and AI-driven
applications demonstrates China's commitment to pushing the boundaries
of technological innovation, attracting international attention and
respect. Huawei's 5G infrastructure development and China's leadership
in solar panel production have resonated with nations seeking
technological solutions. **[China's [investments]{.mark} in green
technology [and]{.mark} its [commitment to]{.mark} addressing
[climate]{.mark} change have also [resonated with nations]{.mark}
seeking sustainable solutions.]{.underline}**

Furthermore, **[China's proactive diplomacy and its [engagement in
multilateral institutions ]{.mark}have [enhanced ]{.mark}its
international [standing]{.mark}. Its [Belt and Road Initiative]{.mark},
while facing criticism for the so-called debt traps, has
[provided]{.mark} infrastructure [development]{.mark} and economic
opportunities to numerous countries, particularly [in]{.mark} the
[developing world]{.mark}. China's [contributions to]{.mark}
[peacekeeping]{.mark} missions [and]{.mark} humanitarian [aid]{.mark}
efforts have further [solidified ]{.mark}its [image]{.mark} as a
responsible global actor.]{.underline}**

**[The [timing]{.mark} of China's soft power ascent [is]{.mark}
particularly [significant]{.mark}. As the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates appears to be [retreating from]{.mark} its traditional
role of global [leadership]{.mark}, [China]{.mark} is [stepping forward
to fill the]{.mark} perceived [vacuum.]{.mark} [Trump's]{.mark} "America
First" [rhetoric,]{.mark} his [withdrawal]{.mark} from international
agreements, [and]{.mark} his imposition of trade [tariffs]{.mark} have
[alienated allies]{.mark} and created uncertainty in the international
system.]{.underline}**

**[This perceived [decline]{.mark} in U.S. soft power is [creating
opportunities for China]{.mark} to expand its influence. U.S. [cultural
dominance]{.mark}, once unquestioned, is [facing]{.mark} increasing
[competition from Chinese]{.mark} cultural [products]{.mark} and digital
platforms. The [U.S. emphasis on unilateralism]{.mark} and its
skepticism towards multilateral institutions [contrast sharply with
China's rhetoric of cooperation]{.mark} and shared
prosperity.]{.underline}**

Moreover, **[[domestic]{.mark} political [divisions and social unrest in
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**, including events such
as the January 6th Capitol riot and increasing political
polarization**[, have [tarnished]{.mark} its [image]{.mark} as a beacon
of democracy and stability. [China]{.mark}, by contrast, [presents
itself as]{.mark} a [stable]{.mark} and reliable partner, a nation
committed to economic development and international
cooperation]{.underline}**. **[A key aspect of this decline is
highlighted by the [Trump]{.mark} administration's [cuts to USAID and
foreign aid programs,]{.mark} which have historically been significant
tools of U.S. soft power. This [retreat from]{.mark} international
[assistance diminishes]{.mark} the U.S. [ability to project]{.mark} a
[positive image]{.mark} and build relationships through development and
humanitarian efforts. This [inconsistency]{.mark} between domestic
policy and international image [erodes trust in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates as a reliable partner.]{.underline}**

### N/U---China Soft Power Low

From the study results, under the society of Nye's Soft power
interpretation, it is the mistake and failure of the overall
policy-making philosophy of China's soft power promotion. In this
research, the subjects did not recognize China's soft power development
program from the theoretical origination dimension. At the cognitive
level, such a soft power communication program was labeled with opposing
ideas and opinions, which made the subsequent promotion of the program
even more difficult. Such situations exist in this experiment and have
lasted for a long time. [[China's]{.mark} perceived influence,
especially in [soft power, is declining in]{.mark} the [developed
countries]{.mark}. Silver et al. (2020) research also substantiates the
situation that most people [in countries such as the UK, the
Netherlands, So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea, [and Japan]{.mark} had
positive opinions of China in 2002; however, **[public opinion had
turned negative]{.mark}** in each of these nations [in 2020.]{.mark}
Even in Germany, which has always supported communication with Beijing,
71% of respondents in 2020 had an unfavorable opinion of China
(Ibid).]{.underline} On the cognitive dimension, we could argue that the
[developed ci knowledge structure towards China has changed and turned
to a negative view since [China has increasingly used nationalistic
tones and has been called "World Wolf-Warriors."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Leino (2021) also argued that [China's [soft power strategies face
challenges **balancing domestic nationalism and international
partnership construction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The present findings of
our research show that China's construction in the face of global
partnership is not yet a success, and the balance has not yet been
achieved, with [nationalism still seeming to be the more potent
force]{.underline}. It can be foreseen that [[if China still
maintains]{.mark} its [current soft power strategies]{.mark}, China's

**[[China has a soft-power problem---especially among its neighbors in
Asia. New data collected]{.underline}]{.mark}** by my organization, the
Eurasia Group Foundation, **[demonstrates that many [people in
Singapore, the Philippines, and South Korea have unfavorable views of
China's soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While about three-quarters of
people surveyed reported favorable views of U.S. soft power (a composite
measure of views of the United States, its culture, its system of
government, and its influence over the past five years), just over
one-third said they had similarly favorable views of Chinese soft power.
This is a concrete problem for Beijing, because in the Philippines and
South Korea, it contributes to policy changes that conflict with China's
objectives.

While **[many in the U.S. foreign-policy community focus on
China's growing military power and reach]{.underline}**, its
**[inability to win new friends and allies though the power of example
requires more focused attention[. China's soft-power deficit]{.mark}
presents the United States with an opportunity to rebuild its own
soft-power assets in Asia]{.underline}**. Based on our data, the United
States should build networks of cooperation on issues such as economic
development, economic disparities between the rich and poor, political
instability, and climate change.

**[Soft power is a [country's ability to attract]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
It includes **[ideology, values, domestic politics, technology, culture,
and influence in international institutions]{.underline}**. Put
differently, it is a country's ability to get others to want what
it wants, without recourse to military force or other forms of coercion.
It helps countries achieve their national security objectives by
influencing allies and partners and obviates the need to forcibly
change what they do. It helps reduce the threat of
conflicts occurring and contributes to balancing the threat of
great-power competition.

**[China's [efforts to build soft power are fraught]{.mark}. The
[countries in which China invests in soft-power assets are increasingly
concerned about China's global ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Chinese economic, cultural, educational, and research investments are
scrutinized regularly, and are received with caution. Indeed, **[China's
attempts to [build soft power are repelling other countries more than
drawing them in because China can seem like
a bully.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

At the end of the Cold War, U.S. soft power was evident across countries
emerging from communism in the thriving black market for Levi's jeans in
Germany, the popularity of Bruce Springsteen, the hourslong lines
outside of Russia's first McDonald's, and the ability to
bring countries such as China into multilateral financial institutions.
In the first decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United
States was the paragon of soft power.

As successive U.S. presidents squandered soft power in post-Sept. 11th
military misadventures and ill-advised trade wars, the concept entered
China's political discourse. At the 17th Party Congress in 2007,
then-President Hu Jintao said that in "the present era, culture has
become a more and more important source of national cohesion and
creativity and a factor of growing significance in the competition in
overall national strength." China's national rejuvenation required
thriving Chinese culture.

In 2011, at the 17th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
an entire plenary session was devoted to culture and developing China
into a cultural superpower. After President Xi Jinping took power in
2013, China began investing heavily in soft power globally. The
resulting policies included the creation of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI);
reorienting China-led international institutions; investments in
Confucius Institutes for education; and funding for
regional think tanks, public diplomacy, and media operations in the
global south. Today, Chinese state media outlets
regularly publishes pieces touting soft power.

Xi's attempt to build nonmilitary influence in South Korea through
"neighborhood diplomacy" began in 2013. He worked to integrate regional
neighbors into a China-led network of economic, political, cultural, and
security relations. This led to high-level China-Korea dialogues and a
new free trade agreement, and Seoul joined the AIIB.

**[But for [soft power to work, a country must be attractive to
others---and China's own frequent fits of pique were more alienating
than alluring]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First, in 2016,
[**[Seoul]{.underline}** **[announced]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[it would
deploy the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
([THAAD)]{.mark} missile system]{.underline}** to intercept North Korean
missiles. **[[China said the THAAD system would be used by the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [for spying]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
Beijing leveled sanctions on Seoul. Bilateral relations with
China cratered.

**[Another contributor is China's [impact on regional
pollution---specifically fine and yellow dust]{.mark}, which [many
Koreans believe comes from China]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
This transboundary air pollution caused domestic uproar in South Korea,
further increasing bilateral tensions.

Recent research linked transboundary air pollution to **[[negative
Korean attitudes and more hawkish foreign-policy
toward China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Our data buttresses these findings.
It indicates that the recent history of poor relations between China and
South Korea is the primary driver of **[[negative attitudes toward
China.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### No China [Soft Power]{.underline}---most countries have [unfavorable]{.underline} views of China.

A **[Pew Research Centre [poll report published]{.mark} in July 2024
found that across the [35 surveyed countries, more have unfavourable
views of China than favourable ones.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

A Perception Malaise 

Amongst the **[18 polled high-income countries, a [majority of their
citizens bear relatively negative views of]{.mark} China]{.underline}**
-- with exceptions being Chile, Greece, and Singapore. In contrast,
amongst the 17 less economically developed countries, a vast majority
possess more affirmative views, with exceptions being India, the
Philippines, and Turkey. Only 16% of surveyed U.S. citizens, and 21% of
those in Canada indicated favourable views, with 81% and 71%
unfavourable. Such numbers should worry any observer of China's
relationships with some of its largest trading partners.

It would be rash and unwise to surmise from the above that China thus
has a soft power deficit across the board, or that its soft power is
dwarfed by the U.S. or the European Union. Indeed, the events unfolding
in Gaza and long-standing domestic malaise have considerably undermined
the U.S.' appeal to citizens in the Global South -- who increasingly eye
the moralising overtones in American foreign policy with suspicion and
alarm. Even the Ranking Member of the so-called Select Committee on the
CCP in the House, Raja Krishnamoorthi, warned in a 2023 Foreign
Policy piece that "The U.S. cannot afford to lose a soft-power race with
China."

**[The jury is still out on the soft power contest]{.underline}** --
**[especially in view of the complexity of an increasingly multi-polar
and fragmented world order]{.underline}**. A political elite-oriented
survey conducted by the ASEAN Studies Centre at ISEAS found that a very
slim majority of ASEAN movers and shakers (50.5%) would opt for China,
whilst a narrow minority of 49.5% would prefer the US, if forced to
choose between the two. That this was the first time Beijing 'edged'
Washington since the survey began asking this question, suggests
shifting sentiments amongst individuals of influence in Southeast Asia.

Neither of these data points can exhaustively reveal the state of play
in the Sino-American soft power contest. It would be useful, however, to
draw conclusions from synthesising the two. As opined by renowned
diplomat Professor Kishore Mahbubani at a recent speech,
**[[increasingly trenchant diplomatic rhetoric from China, ratcheted-up
anti-China rhetoric]{.mark} by select Western sources, and [intensifying
strategic rivalry between China and the Wes]{.mark}t across several key
dimensions have [contributed towards China's uphill struggle with
bolstering its reception]{.mark} in developed economies.]{.underline}**

Whilst Beijing has made considerable inroads in courting and winning
over political leaders in Global South countries -- especially those
that have benefited from comparatively generous and no-strings-attached
loans and financing offered by China -- **[[it has clearly struggled
with its image]{.mark} in]{.underline}** the conventionally advanced
economies of the world, including those comprising G7. **[Japan and
Korea]{.underline}**, with long-standing territorial skirmishes and
historical animosity (especially the former) with China, **[have become
considerably more skeptical in recent years. Politicians in select
[European nations, alarmed by the chorus of allegations of purported
Chinese domestic interference]{.mark}, are swept up in a frenzy of
repudiating any and all deepening of ties with Chinese academic and
technical institutions in their countries]{.underline}**. Companies,
academics, and even investors from China are facing increasing pushback
in economies that had historically been more open and accessible to
constructive engagement.

yc

The **[[integration of soft power]{.mark} in building China's foreign
relations:]{.underline}**

China**[, [despite its undeniable economic and military power]{.mark},
enjoys [a detestable reputation]{.mark} on the international scene,
dragging along with it a [number of issues such as its authoritarianism
and its lack of respect for human rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Recently[, **[the situation of Uighur trafficking in China has received
a lot of international attention and has added another layer to the
unpopularity of the country]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In order to increase
their popularity, China has decided to adapt its foreign policy to soft
power. It was necessary for Beijing to give itself a positive image and
soft power was the best way to do this. The government therefore set up
a strategic line based on international influence. This takes the form
of a gradual increase in its involvement in peacekeeping operations and
a quest for visibility within international organizations.

This strategy was intended to promote the perception of China as a
country that uses its power for peace, helping to build and maintain
peace in conflict-affected countries. As a result, China is now the
largest troop contributor of the five permanent members of the Security
Council and the sixth largest financial contributor to peacekeeping
operations, with a particular geographical focus on the African
continent. It is not surprising to see Beijing involved in peace in
Africa, having invested massively in the continent economically, a
project known as Chinafrica, so these missions serve several Chinese
interests. In recent years, China has participated in twelve
peacekeeping operations in Africa, including in Sudan (UNMIS), Western
Sahara (MINURSO), Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI), Ethiopia-Eritrea (UNMEE),
Liberia (UNMIL), the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) and, since
2013, in Mali (MINUSMA).

**[Despite its efforts for world peace, [China is struggling to promote
these ideas]{.mark} within its own borders]{.underline}**. China is
particularly known for a particular diplomatic practice that has been
called panda diplomacy. It consists in offering giant pandas as gifts to
start diplomatic relations with a new country or to improve existing
ones. This practice is not new since traces of it can already be found
under the Tang dynasty between 618 and 907. It reached its peak under
Maoist China in order to present a softer posture to the rest of the
world and thus to establish relations with the Western bloc countries.
In China, the panda is considered a "national treasure", so the gift has
great significance. However, under pressure from several environmental
activists, this policy was officially stopped in 1984 and was replaced
by long-term loans to foreign zoos because of its protected status.

**[[China remains a contested country and its peacekeeping missions are
seen as hypocritical and opportunistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When
Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008 and the Winter Olympics in
2022, numerous criticisms, protests and calls for boycotts emerged,
dealing a severe blow to China's attempt at soft power. In 2022,
**[Ti[betan demonstrators pleaded outside the]{.mark} International
[Olympic Committee's headquarters]{.mark} in Lausanne "that [Beijing
2022 should not become Berlin 1936]{.mark}",]{.underline}** and many
demonstrations called for a boycott of the Olympics**[. [Washington
announced a "diplomatic boycott" of the Olympics]{.mark} on 9 December
2020. The United States justified this decision by human rights
violations in the Xinjiang region, where China is [accused of holding
one million Uyghurs]{.mark}, a Turkish-speaking Muslim minority, [in
internment camps]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Many countries have followed
suit, including Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and Australia. The
2008 Summer Olympics had been at the origin of a similar movement, but
this time the rallying point was the issue of Tibet. The Olympic Torch
Relay was the scene of numerous demonstrations, in particular during the
lighting of the torch in Olympia on 24 March, then during its passage in
London on 6 April and in Paris on 7 April. As expected by the theory, it
is found that China has relied on cultural diplomacy as a major element
of its international strategy. China has a rich and diverse culture, a
culture that could be its greatest asset. Exporting one's culture allows
Chinese values to coexist with other cultural powers such as the United
States, the United Kingdom and France.

Confucius Institutes are among the major elements of Chinese soft power
in its foreign policies. The aim of these institutes is to spread the
Chinese language, culture, history and philosophy throughout the world.
The logic is simple: the more the world's populations master the Chinese
language and take an interest in the country's culture, the better the
emergence of China and the policies and ideas conveyed by the Middle
Kingdom on the international scene will be understood. The institutes
have grown and multiplied since the mid-2000s. According to the latest
census of the Hanban, the National Bureau for Teaching Chinese as a
Foreign Language (Chinese Ministry of Education), in 2017 there were no
less than 516 Confucius Institutes and 1,076 Confucius classes in
primary and secondary schools in 142 countries. In a globalized world
like ours, the major cultural element is cinema, an industry that China
has long occupied. Cinema has a strong symbolic capital and China has a
massive industry. For the first time in history, China's film revenues
exceeded those of the United States in 2020, making Chinese cinema an
interesting element in the expansion of its soft power. China has become
the world's largest film market, surpassing the US market by a few
million dollars. The primary challenge facing Chinese cinema lies in its
orientation towards a domestic audience, which frequently hinders its
ability to gain traction internationally, particularly amidst stiff
competition from Hong Kong, Japanese, and Korean film industries.
Despite several attempts by American companies to penetrate the Chinese
market, exemplified vividly by Disney's Mulan, which unfortunately met
with failure in Chinese theaters, a handful of Chinese films have
managed to garner global recognition. Ang Lee's masterpiece, Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon, stands as a prime example, having clinched the
prestigious Oscar for Best Foreign Film. One noteworthy success story in
Chinese cinema is the filmography of Zhāng Yì-Móu, which has enjoyed
acclaim on the international stage. Demonstrating a keen understanding
of cinema's potency, China presented The Wandering Earth in 2019.
Adapted from Liu Cixin's acclaimed 2000 short story, this film marked
China's inaugural foray into the realm of science fiction blockbusters
with aspirations reaching beyond its borders. Notably, it marked the
first instance where Chinese censors permitted the portrayal of the
destruction of Beijing and Shanghai. The Wandering Earth swiftly
ascended to become the second highest-grossing film in China's cinematic
history, amassing substantial revenues. Globally, it claimed the third
position among the highest-grossing films of 2019, trailing only behind
Disney juggernauts Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel. Subsequently,
Netflix acquired the rights to The Wandering Earth, facilitating its
dissemination to a global audience when it premiered on April 30, 2019.
This strategic move underscored the film's reach and ensured its
accessibility worldwide. Fast forward to 2024, Liu Cixin's renowned
Chinese science fiction novel received the television treatment,
tailored for an international audience on Netflix by an American
production team, which notably included producers from the acclaimed
series Game of Thrones. Having previously been adapted for Chinese
audiences in 2023, this series now offers a distinct blend of Western
and Chinese influences, providing a fresh perspective that challenges
the prevailing Western-centric narrative in mainstream science fiction.
China's significant investment in the realm of science fiction
underscores its ambition to shape the collective imagination, presenting
a vision of the future where China not only features prominently but
emerges as a pivotal player. This strategic emphasis on science fiction
serves as a potent tool for projecting China's influence onto the global
stage, fostering a narrative that positions the nation at the forefront
of technological innovation and societal advancement. By actively
engaging in the production and promotion of science fiction narratives,
China seeks to assert its presence in the collective consciousness,
shaping perceptions of tomorrow's world and its place within it.
Conclusion:

**[Soft power has infused international relations for decades now and is
seen as an indispensable tool for powers to assert their
status]{.underline}**. Soft power is also necessary to consolidate hard
power and is therefore indispensable. China is one of those nations that
have understood the importance of soft power and have oriented their
international policies towards this objective. Yet, despite its efforts,
China has many obstacles that prevent it from having effective hard and
soft power.

**[The nature of the [Chinese regime is in itself a limit to the soft
power that Beijing seeks to deploy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.The limits of
soft power are therefore to be found more in the sometimes overzealous
initiatives of the Chinese authorities, which have enabled soft power to
take off. **[The [strategy of massive investment in developing
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with no regard for local balances or
respect for human rights, is undoubtedly profitable for Beijing, **[but
could be [considered as hard power rather than soft
power.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### No Link---Greenland

#### **China has empirically always failed in its Greenland mining ventures**

Greenland?; INSS; https://www.inss.org.il/publication/greenland/;

This resource pivot has attracted significant attention from China.
[[Chinese firms]{.mark} have repeatedly [attempted to gain]{.mark} a
[foothold through mining]{.mark} ventures]{.underline}, targeting
Greenlandic zinc, iron, copper, and rare earth elements. They also
sought to renovate three airports and purchase a decommissioned Danish
naval base. [However, **[every one of these attempts has
failed]{.mark}**: [High financial risks sank]{.mark} the Chinese [copper
mine]{.mark}; price drops helped to [derail the iron]{.mark} [mine
project]{.mark}; a better American offer undercut the Chinese zinc deal;
[the rare earths project]{.mark}---entangled with uranium
extraction---[became politically toxic during the 2021
elections]{.mark}, leading the [victorious party to ban uranium, oil,
and gas mining]{.mark} outright]{.underline}; the airport renovations
were blocked under US pressure in 2019; and the naval base sale was
pulled and the head of the Chinese company involved was blacklisted in
China itself. Ultimately, these failed investments made Washington
extremely nervous.

#### China is banned from mining in Greenland

[China identified Greenland as a key foothold in the Arctic due to its
mineral wealth and emerging autonomy]{.underline}. At one point, Chinese
investment accounted for around 12% of Greenland's GDP. State-backed
firms such as Shenghe Resources acquired stakes in mining projects
containing rare earths and uranium. In 2016, a Chinese company attempted
to purchase an abandoned naval base in southern Greenland, which was
later blocked by Danish authorities on national security grounds.

[By 2021, **[Greenland had revoked all remaining Chinese access to its
mining sector]{.mark}**, citing environmental concerns and strategic
sensitivities. As of 2020, [of 39]{.mark} active [mining licenses in
Greenland, none were held by Chinese entities]{.mark}. The government's
Uranium Act and growing scrutiny of foreign influence further curtailed
Beijing's presence on the island.]{.underline}

[For years, the **[U.S.]{.mark}** has been [pushed]{.mark} by military
officials and lawmakers [to devote]{.mark} more [resources to
the]{.mark} rapidly evolving **[Arctic]{.mark}**
environment]{.underline}, but it is a [[recent]{.mark}]{.underline}
surge in [[regional collaboration]{.mark} between **[China]{.mark}** and
**[Russia]{.mark}** that is [giving rise to]{.mark} an all-[new sense of
urgency]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on
Thursday, [Iris A. Ferguson, the deputy assistant [secretary of
defense]{.mark} for **[A]{.mark}rctic and [G]{.mark}lobal
[R]{.mark}esilience,**]{.underline} [[warned]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[**[Beijing]{.mark}** is increasingly [eyeing the Arctic as]{.mark} a
[domain]{.mark} that would [further China's power assertions]{.mark} and
[economic resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Those concerns have been [[amplified by]{.mark} a swarm of [recent
military activity]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. Despite Russia
approaching its third year of war following its February 2022 invasion
of Ukraine, it has remained committed to directing military and economic
resources to the region --- at times with China by its side.

In summer [[2023,]{.mark} [Russian]{.mark} and [Chinese
militaries]{.mark} conducted [joint training]{.mark} in the **[Bering
Strait]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a strategic waterway separating Russian
and Alaskan peninsulas. [[Joint]{.mark} air [exercises]{.mark} and
[patrols]{.mark} by the two nations' coast guards have since
[added]{.mark} to the [uneasiness]{.mark} stirring [in]{.mark} the
[Pentagon]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"This kind of increasing levels of military cooperation is new,"
Ferguson said. "Certainly, it's new within and around Alaska. \... Just
this past summer, right after we released our department \[Arctic\]
strategy, we saw a joint bomber patrol off of the coast."

[[China]{.mark}'s regional [ambitions]{.mark}, meanwhile, are [not
limited to]{.mark} a [military presence]{.mark}, Ferguson said.
Scientific [research projects]{.mark}, among [other endeavors]{.mark},
have provided another [gateway]{.mark} through which [Beijing]{.mark} is
[staking claim]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Such projects could yield long-term economic gains while planting China
on America's doorstep.

"[We really just [need]{.mark} to be [clear]{.mark}-eyed [about]{.mark}
some of their [intentions]{.mark} and \... [thinking]{.mark} about
[their]{.mark} long-term [interests]{.mark} [and]{.mark} how we can best
protect [ours]{.mark}]{.underline}," Ferguson said. "The strategic
interests that they have in the region are ... giving us pause."

Further exacerbating developments has been a warming climate throughout
the high North, where temperatures since 1979 have heated four times
faster than the rest of the world, degrading ice caps and glaciers and
opening previously inaccessible shipping and settlement routes.

In summer 2020, Canada's last remaining ice shelf collapsed into the
Arctic Ocean, severing over 40% of its total area near Nunavut's
Ellesmere Island.

A mixture of air temperatures 9 degrees Fahrenheit above average,
offshore winds and open waters adjacent to the Milne Ice Shelf
instigated a break of ice approximately 80 square kilometers in size, or
roughly 20 square kilometers larger than Manhattan.

[In its [2024 Arctic Strategy]{.mark}, the **[Pentagon]{.mark}**
[noted]{.mark} the "increasingly [accessible region]{.mark} is becoming
a [venue]{.mark} for strategic [competition]{.mark}, and the
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** [must]{.mark} [stand]{.mark}
[ready]{.mark} to [meet]{.mark} the [challenge]{.mark} alongside allies
and partners."]{.underline}

Service-specific and multinational exercises, routine Arctic training
and a continued presence that ensures the stability and defense of
international waterways were points emphasized in the DOD strategy that
would go toward meeting those demands.

To what extent this blend of near-peer enemy and environmental
unpredictabilities will be impacted by the incoming Trump administration
remains to be seen. But for now, at least from the Pentagon's
perspective, the U.S. must remain regionally stout, Ferguson said, and
bolster relationships with northern European allies.

"\[We have\] seven like-minded partners that are incredibly militarily
capable and also have heavy geostrategic alignment with us," she said.
"We've long had exercises that operate in the region, but we're really
looking at how we can use those as a deterrent effect, working alongside
our allies and partners."

**[efforts]{.mark}** have **[backfired]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Taiwanese
identity has grown stronger, and [**[trust]{.mark}** in China has
**[declined]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through
appeal and attraction rather than coercion. However, [[China's]{.mark}
reliance on **economic** [**pressure**, **censorship** and **political**
**influence** **contradicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} this definition[,
[aligning]{.mark} more [closely with "**sharp
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}". [It]{.underline} is a form of influence
that [[relies on **manipulation** and **coercion** rather than voluntary
attraction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead of fostering goodwill, [China's
[approach feels like **pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline}; and Taiwan has
responded by pushing further away.

**[Taiwan]{.underline}** represents [the most **significant**
**challenge** for **China**]{.underline}. If [Beijing]{.underline} is
unable to bring it under its influence through peaceful means, its
[choices are **limited**]{.underline}. Resorting to military action is
expensive, fraught with danger and has the potential to ignite a broader
conflict. The shortcomings of China's soft power increase the likelihood
of confrontation. Understanding why China's strategy is failing shows
how Taiwan is resisting and why the divide is only growing.

The Decline of Chinese Media Influence

ONCE POPULAR in Taiwan, [[Chinese **drama**]{.mark}**s** [and]{.mark}
**pop** **[music]{.mark}** have [lost]{.mark} their
[appeal]{.mark}]{.underline}. Government [[censorship]{.mark} has
[**drained** **creativity**]{.mark}, [making entertainment
**predictable** and]{.mark}]{.underline} infused with
**[[nationalist]{.underline}]{.mark}** themes. Rather than engaging
audiences, [[films]{.mark} and TV shows have [become **political**
**tools**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taiwanese viewers, accustomed to free
expression, now favour their own media, where artists can speak without
restriction.

**[Chinese [celebrities]{.mark}]{.underline}** have also faced backlash.
Many [are [pressured]{.mark} [to apologize for referring to **Taiwan**
as a **country**]{.mark}]{.underline} or are forced to declare loyalty
to Beijing. These incidents fuel resentment rather than connection. The
2015 case of Taiwanese K-pop singer Chou Tzuyu, who was forced to
apologize for waving Taiwan's flag, intensified distrust toward China's
influence over entertainers. Actress Ouyang Nana has faced criticism for
expressing pro-China views, while some, like Angela Zhang, remain
neutral to preserve their cross-strait careers.

While some celebrities continue to express pro-China views, particularly
during culturally significant periods like Lunar New Year, the [overall
[trend indicates]{.mark} a [**growing** **wariness** among
**Taiwan**]{.mark}**ese** audiences]{.underline} toward such
endorsements. This [shift reflects a broader skepticism of **China's**
**influence** operations]{.underline}, encompassing not just
entertainment but also cyber activities and diplomatic maneuvers aimed
at undermining Taiwan's self-governance.

Beyond entertainment, [[China]{.mark} has [sought to **control**
**Taiwan's** **media**]{.mark}]{.underline} landscape by funding
pro-China news outlets. These [[efforts]{.mark} have been [exposed,
triggering]{.mark} **public** **[backlash]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
**[Disinfo]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**rmation**
**[campaigns]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly those aimed at
influencing elections, [have been [**debunked** and
**ridiculed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A 2023 study by Taiwan's Ministry of
Digital Affairs found that over 70% of young Taiwanese distrust content
from pro-China media sources. **[[The more Beijing tries to
manipulate]{.mark} the narrative, [the less influence it]{.mark}
actually [holds]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Economic Leverage: A Failing Strategy

[[CHINA]{.mark} ONCE WIELDED **significant** **economic**
**power**]{.underline} over Taiwan. In the early 2000s, many Taiwanese
enterprises ventured into the mainland, drawn by rapid economic
expansion. That [**[influence]{.mark}** is now
**[diminishing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With China's economy slowing and
political uncertainties rising, more Taiwanese [[firms]{.mark} are
[looking toward **Southeast** **Asia** and]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}nited** **[S]{.mark}tates**.]{.underline} Economic
[dependence on China]{.underline} now [feels like a
**risk**]{.underline} rather than an opportunity.

**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [tried to [force **compliance**
by **cracking** **down**]{.mark} on]{.underline} Taiwanese
**[brands]{.underline}** that do not align with its political stance.
[[Businesses]{.underline}]{.mark} have been [[pressured to take
**pro-China** **positions** or face]{.mark} **economic**
**[punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In 2021, several
Taiwanese bubble tea brands faced boycotts and regulatory scrutiny in
China after failing to explicitly endorse Beijing's views on Taiwan.
[This **[strategy]{.mark}** has [fuelled **distrust**]{.mark} instead of
loyalty]{.underline}. Instead of strengthening ties, China's economic
coercion has made engagement with the mainland seem like a liability.

[China's]{.underline} previous economic strategy, including the 2008
Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement
(**[[ECFA]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[**momentarily**
**strengthened**]{.mark} economic [ties]{.mark}]{.underline},
demonstrating China's early success in soft power.
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, Taiwan's shifting economic landscape,
coupled with [[fears of **over**-**reliance**, reversed]{.mark} this
[trend]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beijing's failure to adapt its strategy has
now turned economic incentives into economic liabilities.

However, despite these shifts, many Taiwanese businesses still operate
in China. According to a 2023 report by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic
Affairs, Taiwanese investment in China totaled approximately US\$3.04
billion, showing that while diversification is happening, complete
economic disengagement is not. Semiconductor companies like TSMC
continue to have supply-chain dependencies on Chinese manufacturers.
This suggests that while Taiwan is reducing its reliance on China, the
economic connection remains significant, complicating full
disengagement.

Beijing dangles economic incentives but only for those who comply with
its demands. Those who refuse face repercussions. As a result, rather
than expanding its influence, China has only succeeded in alienating
Taiwan further.

[[China has a **soft-power problem**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[especially
[among]{.mark}]{.underline} its neighbors in
[[Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. New data collected by my organization, the
**[[Eurasia]{.mark} Group Foundation]{.underline}**,
[[demonstrates]{.underline}]{.mark} that many
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark} in Singapore, the Philippines, and South
Korea [[have **unfavorable** **views** of China]{.mark}'s soft
power]{.underline}. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark} about
[[**three**-**quarters**]{.underline}]{.mark} of people surveyed
[[report]{.mark}ed [favorable views of U.S.]{.mark} **soft**
**power**]{.underline} (a composite measure of views of the United
States, its culture, its system of government, and its influence over
the past five years), just over one-third said they had similarly
favorable views of Chinese soft power. This is a concrete problem for
Beijing, because in the Philippines and South Korea, it contributes to
policy changes that conflict with China's objectives.

While many in the U.S. foreign-policy community focus on China's growing
military power and reach, [its [**inability** to win **new**
**friends**]{.mark} and **allies** though the power of example requires
more focused attention]{.underline}. China's soft-power deficit presents
the United States with an opportunity to rebuild its own soft-power
assets in Asia. Based on our data, the [United States should build
networks of **cooperation**]{.underline} on issues [such as economic
development, **economic** **disparities** between the **rich** and
**poor**, **political** **instability**, and **climate**
**change**]{.underline}.

[[Soft power]{.underline}]{.mark} is a country's ability to attract. It
[[includes]{.mark} **ideology**, **values**, **domestic** **politics**,
**technology**, **culture**, and **[influence]{.mark}** in international
institutions]{.underline}. Put differently, it is a country's ability to
get others to want what it wants, without recourse to military force or
other forms of coercion. It helps countries achieve their national
security objectives by influencing allies and partners and obviates the
need to forcibly change what they do. It helps reduce the threat of
conflicts occurring and contributes to balancing the threat of
great-power competition.

[[China's efforts]{.mark} to build **soft** **power** [are
**fraught**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[countries in which China
invests]{.underline}]{.mark} in soft-power assets [are [increasingly
**concerned** about]{.mark} China's [**global**
**ambitions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Chinese]{.mark} economic,
cultural, educational, and research [investments are **scrutinized**
**regularly**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and are received with caution.
Indeed, [China's]{.underline} attempts to build soft power are
[[**repelling** other countries]{.mark} more than **drawing** them
in]{.underline} because [China [can seem like a
**bully**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

At the end of the Cold War, U.S. soft power was evident across countries
emerging from communism in the thriving black market for Levi's jeans in
Germany, the popularity of Bruce Springsteen, the hourslong lines
outside of Russia's first McDonald's, and the ability to bring countries
such as China into multilateral financial institutions. In the first
decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States was the
paragon of soft power.

As successive U.S. presidents squandered soft power in post-Sept. 11th
military misadventures and ill-advised trade wars, the concept entered
China's political discourse. At the 17th Party Congress in 2007,
then-President Hu Jintao said that in "the present era, culture has
become a more and more important source of national cohesion and
creativity and a factor of growing significance in the competition in
overall national strength." China's national rejuvenation required
thriving Chinese culture.

In 2011, at the 17th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
an entire plenary session was devoted to culture and developing China
into a cultural superpower. After President Xi Jinping took power in
2013, China began investing heavily in soft power globally. The
resulting policies included the creation of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI);
reorienting China-led international institutions; investments in
Confucius Institutes for education; and funding for regional think
tanks, public diplomacy, and media operations in the global south.
Today, Chinese state media outlets regularly publishes pieces touting
soft power.

[Xi's attempt to build **nonmilitary** **influence** in **South**
**Korea** through "**neighborhood** **diplomacy**]{.underline}" began in
2013. He worked to integrate regional neighbors into a China-led network
of economic, political, cultural, and security relations. This led to
high-level China-Korea dialogues and a new free trade agreement, and
Seoul joined the AIIB.

But [for soft power to work, a [country must be
**attractive**]{.mark}]{.underline} to others---and
[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} own frequent fits of pique were [[more
**alienating** than **alluring**]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, in 2016,
[[**Seoul** announced it would deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S.-made
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ([[THAAD]{.underline}]{.mark})
missile system [[to **intercept** **No**]{.mark}**rth**
**[Ko]{.mark}rean** [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China
said]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[THAAD]{.mark} system [would be used by
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [for
**spying**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} Beijing
[leveled [sanctions]{.mark} on [Seoul]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[**Bilateral** **relations**]{.mark} with China
**[cratered]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Another contributor is [[China's]{.mark} impact on **regional**
**[pollution]{.mark}**]{.underline}---specifically fine and yellow dust,
which many [[**Koreans** **believe**]{.mark} comes [from
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This transboundary [[air pollution caused
**domestic** **uproar** in So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea, further
[increasing]{.mark} **bilateral** **[tensions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Recent [[research linked]{.mark} **transboundary**]{.underline} air
[[**pollution** to negative]{.mark} Korean
[attitudes]{.mark}]{.underline} and more hawkish foreign-policy toward
China. Our data buttresses these findings. It indicates that the recent
history of poor relations between China and South Korea is the primary
driver of negative attitudes toward China.

#### [Joseph Nye]{.underline} agrees.

Firstpost, 10-3-2024,
https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-chinas-soft-power-fails-to-soften-its-image-13821837.html//phs-FM)

[**[Joseph Nye]{.mark}**, the father of "soft power,"
[reveals]{.mark}]{.underline} in his latest book, A Life in the American
Century, how in December 2013, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi invited
him to a private meal to quiz him about how China could increase its
soft power. Nye replied, "Raising hundreds of millions of people out of
poverty and celebrating a gorgeous traditional culture are important
sources of attraction for China. At the same time, [[as long as it had
**territorial** **disputes**]{.mark} with its neighbours
and]{.underline} as long as its [[**insistence** on **tight** **party**
**control** over]{.mark} **civil** [**society** and **human**
**rights**]{.mark}]{.underline} continued, [[China would face
**serious** **limits** on]{.mark} its [**soft**
**power**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Asia and the West."

[Before]{.underline} the concept of "[soft power" was
introduced]{.underline} by Nye, [[China had **already** **lost** a
major]{.underline}]{.mark} part of its [[share of soft
power]{.underline}]{.mark} points. After the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) took over China, strategically[, it [began to **invade**]{.mark}
[its neighbouring **countries**, including]{.mark} East
[Turkestan]{.mark}, [Tibet, and]{.mark} southern
[Mongolia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Communist China [also decided to
[intervene in]{.mark} the [**Korean** **War**]{.mark}]{.underline}, just
a week after it invaded Tibet. Worse, after entrenching its rule in
Tibet, the CCP [also decided to [**encroach** on the borders of
**India**]{.mark}]{.underline}, eventually leading to the China-India
War of 1962. All [these [**military** **invasions**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} interventions had [[**permanently** **dented**]{.mark}
the international [image of]{.mark} '**New**
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[']{.mark}**. Within China too, in the
name of the Great Leap Forward, the CCP pushed China to three years of
famine and later euphemistically called it the three years of natural
disasters. The [outbreak of the infamous [Cultural Revolution]{.mark}
further [made the **CCP** **unlovable**]{.mark}]{.underline} by its
people.

What happens in Tibet never stays in Tibet

For decades, the [[CCP]{.mark} was [convinced]{.mark} that [**Tibetan**
**people**]{.mark} might have been **[enchanted]{.mark}**]{.underline}
by the development shoved on them; however, the peaceful protests of
1987-89 and the 2008 uprising in Tibet pushed them out of their beds. To
counter the internationalisation of the Tibet issue, from the 1990s
onwards, the [CCP began to churn out its first of many white papers on
Tibet]{.underline}. This is still being dished out mechanically. Y[early
[reports]{.mark} [from]{.mark}]{.underline} various
[**well**-**established** [rights groups]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
Freedom House, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch (HRW)
continue to [[highlight growing human **rights**
**violations**]{.underline}]{.mark} in Tibet.

Like the [[systematic detention of **millions** of **Uyghur**
**Muslims**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the internment camps by the CCP in
the western region of East Turkestan, which [[received]{.mark} a
**[tremendous]{.mark}** amount of [**international**
**attention**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, the exposition by the
Tibet Action Institute report that [around [**one** **million** Tibetan
**children**]{.mark}]{.underline} aged six to eighteen [were [forced to
live in Chinese]{.mark} government-run [**colonial** **boarding**
**schools**]{.mark}]{.underline} and preschools had also drawn
international attention. In the recent report by HRW, Educate the Masses
to Change Their Minds: [[China's]{.mark} **Forced** [**Relocation**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} Rural Tibetans, it is reported that over
[[**707**,**000** people]{.underline}]{.mark} have relocated. Most of
the Tibetan people were forcibly relocated. All [these
[reports]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[**severely** **tarnished**
the]{.underline}]{.mark} nosedive [**[image]{.mark}** of communist
China]{.underline} and its long-held aspiration for a lovable image and
the so-called responsible superpower.

Like Charity, Soft Power too begins at Home

Unlike democratic nations, the [[CCP needs]{.mark} to charm both
**[domestic]{.mark}ally** [and
**international**]{.mark}**ly**]{.underline}. Within China, the CCP is
trying to charm its people without losing control. In other words, the
[CCP is [implementing]{.mark} the [**carrot** and **stick**
**policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Communist China's handling of the
Tiananmen Square movement earned the ire of international communities as
well as the Chinese people. Many [[Western countries]{.mark} decided to
[freeze **high**-**level** contacts with China]{.mark}]{.underline} for
around two years. There have been [[dramatic declines in revenues from
**tourism**]{.underline}]{.mark} (down 20 per cent in 1989), [direct
[**foreign** **investment**]{.mark}]{.underline} (down 22 per cent in
the first half of 1990), [[and foreign lending]{.underline}]{.mark}
(down 40 per cent in 1989). Because of this, the [[CCP]{.mark} decided
to **[reorient]{.mark}** its [domestic and foreign
policies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

However, the CCP is still wary of its own people, and it is [no wonder
that China's **domestic** **security** spending is **higher** than its
defence-related expenses]{.underline}. [[Covid]{.mark}-19 further
[proved]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**mismanagement** and **brutalities**
of the CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}, and common [[Chinese]{.mark} [people
realized the importance of **freedom** and]{.mark} the **[free]{.mark}**
**flow** of **[information]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The death of Dr. Li
Wenliang became the most talked-about topic on WeChat and Weibo (China's
two biggest social media platforms), attracting millions of posts and
searches and garnering an estimated 1.5 billion views. Following the
Covid-19 pandemic, [[negative views]{.mark} of China [increased by
**double** **digits**]{.mark}]{.underline} in more than half of the
countries surveyed in the international poll by the Pew Research
Center[. If the [CCP]{.mark} is not able to win]{.underline} the hearts
and minds of [its **own** **people**]{.underline}, [it [will be very
difficult to charm]{.mark} the [**international**
**community**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, if you are not soft
towards your family members and always create problems inside your home,
you cannot expect your neighbours to smile back.

Good Fences Make Good Neighbours

[[China has]{.mark} one of the [**highest** **numbers** of
**territorial** **disputes**]{.mark}]{.underline} with its neighbouring
countries on land and sea. For instance, with India, China has one of
the oldest territorial disputes in the world, which is still unresolved,
and [China is [not in the **good** **books** of]{.mark} many
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a [2023 [Pew Research
Center survey]{.mark}]{.underline}, a median of [[**67** **per
cent**]{.mark} of adults across 24 countries express [**unfavourable**
views of China]{.mark}]{.underline}. A median of [[71]{.mark} per cent
[thinks China does not contribute to **global** **peace** and
**stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not only that, a median of [[**76**
per cent think China does not take into account]{.mark} the
[**interests** of]{.mark} other [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} in its
foreign policy, and a median of 57 oer cent say China interferes in the
affairs of other nations a great deal.

According to Nirupama Rao, former Ambassador of India to the United
States, "[The **[mistrust]{.mark}** of China [only **deepened** after
**Xi**]{.mark} Jinping [came to power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[He is
viewed as]{.underline}]{.mark} being at the helm of a nation that is
much more [[**muscular**, **confrontational**, and
**aggressive**]{.mark} in]{.underline} the pursuit of [[**territorial**
**claims** across the **Indo**-**Pacific** region]{.underline}]{.mark},
both on land and sea." Out of 133 countries surveyed by Gallup in 2023,
the [[**US** enjoyed]{.mark} a soft power [advantage in **81**]{.mark}
of them, [and **China** in **52**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, the
global approval of US leadership is higher than that of China. In short,
every neighboring country is on its toes when it comes to dealing with
China.

ANOTHER TRIUMPH for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)! **[That [part of
the Chinese media]{.mark} aimed at readers abroad made much of the news
that late last month a Chinese company had completed laying the track
for a high-speed railway between Jakarta and Bandung in
[Indonesia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The railway, for which China won a
contract in 2015, is what its media call an "exemplary" project.
Criticism of it is dismissed as "Western slander", of the sort that has
dogged the BRI as a whole. But in fact the railway illustrates the
suspicion and resentment that Chinese projects often face in the
countries where they are built.

The BRI was launched a decade ago to pour Chinese investment
into building infrastructure linking Asia and Europe. **[It has since
expanded to cover the whole world and some 150 countries from Somalia to
Poland]{.underline}**. Last month Jim Yong Kim, a former president of
the World Bank, called it the "most ambitious development project in
human history". Before the BRI, **[Chinese investments in other Asian
countries were [sniped at for all manner of alleged sins, including
fostering corruption, environmental vandalism and distorting national
politics]{.mark}. The BRI was [meant in part to demonstrate China's
essential benevolence]{.mark}. In that respect, [it has not
worked.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The annual Boao Forum for Asia, a kind of Davos for China's backyard
held in the country's south at the end of March, was this year partly
devoted to celebrating ten years of the BRI and, in a favourite phrase
of China's leaders, its "win-win" character. But China's growing
economic influence is still far from universally welcomed---in part
because of, rather than in spite of, the boom in Chinese-led investment
projects.

**[The 142km Jakarta-[Bandung line]{.mark}---which should [cut the
journey from three hours to 40 minutes]{.mark}, and ease Jakarta's
appalling congestion---illustrates some of the
criticisms]{.underline}**. One is that although China offers what look
like easier financial terms and has a reputation for efficient
execution, **[its projects are as [prone as any to delays and
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this case, the first feasibility
study was done by Japanese companies. But Japan demanded a government
guarantee for 50% of the financing. A rival Chinese proposal required no
guarantee, and seemed cheaper. Yet when it opens in July it **[will be
[several hundred million dollars over budget and four years behind
schedule]{.mark}, because of pandemic-related, land-acquisition and
other delays and environmental controversies]{.underline}**.

The project is 60% owned by Indonesian government companies, and was
initially financed by a \$4.5bn loan from the state-owned China
Development Bank. This loan is on highly concessional terms (an interest
rate of 2% and a 40-year repayment period), so **[[China takes umbrage
at allegations that it is part of a "debt-trap]{.mark}" strategy.
Indeed, [China's critics do seem to want to have it both
ways---castigating it for enmeshing its partners]{.mark} in a net of
unsustainable debt, and then seizing gleefully on reports that between
2000 and 2021]{.underline}**, China spent \$240bn bailing out 22
countries, with almost all of it going to those that are host
to BRI projects. Yet China has sometimes proved obstructive when it
comes to international sovereign debt-relief efforts, denting its image.

**[Another oft-cited example of China's "[debt-trap diplomacy]{.mark}"
is the [Chinese-built and-financed port in Hambantota, in southern Sri
Lanka]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The port opened in 2010, but the
government soon found itself in dire financial straits and asked
**[China to take over, which in 2017 a Chinese firm duly did, on a
[99-year lease.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The takeover [enraged Sri Lankans and was a blow to national
self-esteem]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but the debt-trap accusations seem
unfair. The episode, however, **[illustrates another feature of Chinese
projects that causes [local resentment: that they seem to favour
incumbent rulers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In was widely seen in Sri Lanka
as one of many vanity projects promoted by Mahinda Rajapaksa, then the
president. The port was an issue in the 2015 presidential election,
which Mr Rajapaksa lost.

The perception that China abuses its economic muscle is widespread
across South-East Asia. An annual survey of more than 1,300 officials,
academics, businesspeople and other opinion-formers across the region,
published in February by the ASEAN Studies Centre at the ISEAS-Yusof
Ishak Institute, a think-tank in Singapore, **[found that nearly [70% of
those who see China as the region's most influential strategic power
view its growing influence with concern]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China's
win-win economic diplomacy seems to need all the good publicity it can
get.

The **[[Chinese tracking ship]{.mark} Yuan Wang 5 has finally [docked at
Hambantota]{.mark} Port in Sri Lanka]{.underline}** for replenishment
after India and the United States tried, and ultimately failed, to
persuade the local government to turn it away. **[The arrival of the
massive vessel might seem like a [victory for Beijing]{.mark} in this
strategically important island nation.]{.underline}**

But it is, in fact, nothing of the kind, because **[it [reinforces the
image of China as a predatory imperial power]{.mark} that is [trying to
exploit Sri Lanka for its own purposes. Beijing has done little to help
the country through its devastating economic
meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline}**, providing far less aid than regional

**[Quite why China would [sit back and allow an adversary to reap the

influence under the guise of seemingly benign infrastructure
projects.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Exhibit A in this regard is **[Hambantota]{.underline}**, where the PLA
vessel has docked. **[[The project was financed by Chinese
loans]{.mark}, but in 2017 [Beijing allegedly seized the port when Sri
Lanka could not service its debt]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ever since, the
example of Hambantota has been cited by western officials seeking to
warn of the perils of Chinese lending.

However, this episode has been widely misrepresented. China did not
seize the port, but leased it for 99 years. Sri Lanka proposed the deal
because it urgently needed foreign exchange to pay Western creditors.
The loans used to finance Hambantota were not written off; they are
still on the books. China supposedly grabbed Hambantota because it
wanted to establish a naval base along strategic shipping lanes. But
there has been no evidence of any PLA military activity there prior to
the arrival of this tracking vessel. And Indian and American ships have
visited, so why not Chinese? Debt-trap diplomacy is little more than a
conspiracy theory. Eurobonds account for the largest proportion (36 per
cent) of Sri Lanka's sovereign debt. China's share is admittedly
sizeable, ranging between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, depending on the
way it is calculated. But, however you crunch the numbers, Beijing is
not primarily responsible for the country's crisis.

Still, while accusations of nefarious Chinese designs on Hambantota
might be bogus, they are widely believed, and China has not done itself
any favours with the PLA visit this month, which **[[plays into concerns
that it is trying to militarise the island, handing Delhi a propaganda
victory.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In recent years China and India have been engaged in a tug of war for
influence in Sri Lanka. China held clout during the presidency of
Mahinda Rajapaksa from 2005 to 2015; then it lost ground to Delhi under
his successor; but regained influence when Mahinda's brother, Gotabaya,
took the helm in 2019.

Now the tables have turned once again. **[[Gotabaya and his brother both
resigned from government]{.mark} this year, depriving China of its best
friends in Colombo. [India has moved in to alleviate Sri Lanka's
desperate food and fuel shortages with over \$3.8 billion of
assistance]{.mark}. Beijing, by contrast, has provided a relatively
paltry \$74 million]{.underline}**.

For months Sri Lanka has been pleading with China for more support, but
to no avail. While India extended a currency swap arrangement with Sri
Lanka in April, the People's Bank of China has suspended its own swap
line because the country lacks sufficient foreign exchange reserves.
China has also expressed a reluctance to write off its Sri Lankan loans,
playing into accusations of stinginess when it comes to debt
renegotiations. Indeed, China's record in this area shows a refusal to
negotiate debt relief with other creditors and a preference for engaging
in secretive, bilateral loan restructurings. Beijing has been happier
extending new loans than writing off old ones, thus fulfilling a role
akin to that of the International Monetary Fund, which provides
cash-strapped countries with emergency financing. But in many of these
cases liquidity is not the problem; solvency is. And what countries
really need from China is a reduction in their debt load, not more
credit. Things might be changing. China has just reached a deal with
Zambia's other creditors to provide some form of debt relief as part of
a multilateral G20 initiative. But the details of this agreement remain
unclear and it is too soon to say that Beijing has softened its
approach.

Certainly, **[its [image will suffer even further if it plays
hardball]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Sri Lanka. While China has been
blamed unfairly for its role in the island's crisis, **[its [handling of
the situation has so far been clumsy and self-destructive, enabling its
rival, India, to claw back some influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If
Beijing doesn't mend its ways, **[[it could experience setbacks in other
indebted countries, too.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

## CCP Legitimacy

### U---Xi Resilient 

#### Xi is resilient

**Cunningham 7/10** \[Michael Cunningham, 7-10-2025, \"China coup?
Rumours of Xi Jinping's decline are premature\", Lowy Institute,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/china-coup-rumours-xi-jinping-s-decline-are-premature\]
yc

In recent weeks, **[a [flurry of reports]{.mark} has [predicted the
imminent downfall of]{.mark} China's President [Xi]{.mark}
Jinping]{.underline}**. Similar **[[rumours have surfaced repeatedly
over his 13-year rule]{.mark} -- and [each time have proven
false]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While scepticism about Xi's invincibility
is warranted, history suggests that today's chatter will likely also
turn out to be unfounded.

To be sure, something strange is happening in Beijing. Since Xi began
his third term in 2022, **[several of his hand[-picked appointees have
been removed, prompting speculation]{.mark} about a power struggle in
the Chinese Communist Party]{.underline}**. Most of the activity has
occurred in the military, leading some to conclude that Xi is losing
control of the armed forces. But not all analysts agree with this
assessment. Some see the intrigue as **[[ev]{.mark}idence of [Xi's
further consolidation of power]{.mark} or even as [infighting among his
subordinates]{.mark} that has [no effect on him.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Despite the noise, no one has credibly explained how a leader who
dominates every significant CCP organisation could be toppled.
**[[All]{.mark} seven members [of the Politburo Standing
Committee]{.mark} are either [long-time Xi allies]{.mark} or have served
him loyally for over a decade]{.underline}**. More than half of the
broader Politburo's 24 members are his protégés, and nearly all the
others had direct ties to him prior to their appointments. **[The
[factions rumoured to be plotting against Xi lack meaningful
representation in]{.mark} the [bodies that appoint and remove senior
officials]{.mark}. The notion that these [sidelined groups]{.mark} have
[somehow outmanoeuvred a political operator as shrewd]{.mark} and
relentless [as Xi strains credulity]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Nor has Xi made a recent blunder so catastrophic that it would convince
his allies that his continued rule is a liability to the Party. His
Covid-19 strategy collapsed in 2022, resulting in a year of widespread
lockdowns that stalled economic activity, threatened social stability,
and saddled provincial governments with dangerous levels of debt. But
that was three years ago. Instead of punishing Xi, the Party awarded him
a precedent-breaking third term and allowed him to further consolidate
his control.

**[For all the turbulence of Xi's tenure, the [CCP generally views him
as a success]{.mark}. Xi has [presided over China's rise as a global
power and reasserted the Party's control of society]{.mark} more
comprehensively than any leader since Mao]{.underline}**. Though his
handling of the economy and of US-China relations has drawn some
criticism, few believe removing him would erase US tariffs or improve
China's global standing. If anything, Xi is credited with forcing
Washington back to the negotiating table in the latest trade standoff.

Some **[reports claim that [Zhang Youxia]{.mark}]{.underline}**, vice
chairman of the Central Military Commission and a longtime Xi ally,
**[is plotting his removal]{.underline}** -- possibly through a coup. If
true, this would be seismic. However, these **[[assertions stem from
overseas dissident outlets]{.mark} with a mixed track record for
accuracy]{.underline}**. Crucially, they offer **[[no compelling
explanation for why Zhang would turn on Xi]{.mark}, especially after Xi
retained him in 2022 despite Zhang's having surpassed the customary
retirement age.]{.underline}**

Much of the **[narrative around Xi's supposed decline [relies on
selective, often decontextualised, observations]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Critics point to his **[[absence from this week's BRICS Summit]{.mark}
in Brazil but [overlook his three overseas trips]{.mark} so far this
year]{.underline}** -- consistent with recent patterns -- and **[[the
steady stream of foreign leaders]{.mark} he continues to host [in
Beijing.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Others overinterpret isolated state media reports]{.underline}** that
fail to mention Xi's honorifics, overlooking the fact that most official
discourse continues to emphasise his central role. And, contrary to
claims of Xi's declining media presence, a recent **[[China Media
Project]{.mark} study [found that references]{.mark} to him are [holding
firm in 2025]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with no other senior leader gaining
visibility at his expense.

Rumours and coded messages can offer valuable clues about cracks within
the Chinese leadership. However, such signals are open to interpretation
and often **[reflect more [hopeful speculation than hard
evidence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

If Xi's position were truly in jeopardy, we wouldn't need to rely
entirely on parsing obscure policy documents for clues.
**[[Removing]{.mark} the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao would
likely [resemble past episodes of political]{.mark} upheaval, which
brought down some of the most senior Party figures.]{.underline}** The
turbulent Mao era, for example, saw **[CCP Vice-Chairman [Liu Shaoqi
purged]{.mark} and summarily [placed under house arrest]{.mark} and his
successor, [Lin Biao]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- once Mao's "closest
comrade-in-arms" -- **[[killed]{.mark} in a suspicious plane crash while
fleeing the country]{.underline}**. These are just two examples of a
string of decidedly unsubtle events.

Today's **[[China, by comparison]{.mark}, appears [relatively
stable]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The most senior figure believed to have
been ousted during Xi's third term is He Weidong, a Politburo member and
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, who hasn't been seen
since March. This is significant, but He -- admittedly a Xi ally -- is
not generally understood to be part of his inner circle. If some of Xi's
closest allies -- Cai Qi or Ding Xuexiang, for example -- are targeted,
that will be a more likely sign of trouble for Xi.

**[[If Xi Jinping]{.mark} truly [faces serious internal
challenges]{.mark}, such [overt indicators will eventually
appear]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For now, however, the evidence suggests
Xi remains firmly in control.

#### The CCP is resilient, adaptation and bounce back. 

**Dimitrov 24** (Martin K. Dimitrov \[Professor of Political Science at
Tulane University\], The Adaptability of the Chinese Communist Party,
12-1-2024,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/adaptability-of-the-chinese-communist-party/B9E0A6F949B85A8FC9722123244C295C//phs-DZ)

Scholarly understandings of the adaptive capacity of the CCP reflect the
evolution of the discipline of political science. Until the Eastern
European and Soviet collapses, the general consensus was that communist
regimes will persist (Kuran 1991), regardless of whether scholars
conceptualized them as totalitarian polities incapable of evolution
(Friedrich and Brzezinski 1965) or acknowledged the possibility of
dynamic change (Bunce 1981; Oi 1985; Hauslohner 1987). In a sharp
reversal, following the Soviet collapse, political scientists began to
doubt the staying power of the remaining communist regimes, including
that in China. Scholars anticipated a coming collapse (Chang 2001),
variously attributed to rising prosperity (Rowen 1996), disaffected
elites (Gilley 2004), or socioeconomic pressures fueled by extreme
corruption stemming from the lack of political reform (Pei 2006). The
tenor of these arguments maintained that ossification prevented dynamic
change. **[However, simultaneous with such pessimistic accounts of
[China]{.mark}'s future, two novel propositions have emerged. One
[stresses]{.mark} the [resilience of]{.mark} the [system]{.mark},
[focusing on]{.mark} the increasingly [predictable and meritocratic
nature of elite politics]{.mark}, on the more clearly specified mandates
of institutions, [and]{.mark} on opportunities for [citizen
participation]{.mark} (Nathan 2003). Another [proposition
emphasizes]{.mark} the [atrophy of]{.mark} the [CCP]{.mark} after the
Soviet collapse but [it]{.mark} also [suggests]{.mark} that there have
been signs of [adaptation]{.mark}, especially [in]{.mark} the realm of
inner-party democracy and [ideological acceptance]{.mark} of capitalists
(Shambaugh 2008).]{.underline}** The field of China studies thus entered
the 2010s with the two images of resilience and adaptation. In contrast
to the 1990s, the consensus in the 2010s was that China was not
threatened by imminent collapse. The 2010s and early 2020s have been
marked by a search to identify the reasons for the resilience of the
Chinese political system (Hsu, Tsai, and Chang 2021). Considering the
complexity of the issue, there are variations in the following
explanations. **[Some [scholars point to]{.mark} [repression and social
control]{.mark} (Mattingly 2020; Ong 2022; Byler 2022), as well as to
the [co-optation]{.mark} of religious organizations (Reny 2018). Others
develop arguments about the regime-sustaining effects of economic growth
(Ang 2020). Those studying [elite politics stress]{.mark} the [skillful
management]{.mark} of factional conflict and rivalries (Fewsmith 2021;
Shih 2022). [Popular support for the party and its domestic and foreign
policies is highlighted]{.mark} as well (Dickson 2016; 2021; Shirk 2007;
2023; Weiss 2014). [With regard to adaptation]{.mark}, some [scholars
emphasize]{.mark} the [repurposing or retrofitting]{.mark} of
institutions (Oi and Goldstein 2018; Gueorguiev 2021), whereas others
focus on experimentation [in]{.mark} governance [techniques]{.mark},
[what they call a "guerrilla policy style]{.mark}"]{.underline}**
(Heilmann and Perry 2011). How does the present Element relate to
existing studies of adaptation and resilience? According to Heilmann and
Perry, **[[resilience is "]{.mark}the [capacity]{.mark} of a system [to
experience and absorb shocks]{.mark} and disturbances," whereas
adaptability is "the capacity of actors in a system to further
[resilience]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Heilmann and Perry 2011, 8). I
adopt a different view, conceptualizing resilience as the long-term
outcome of adaptive change (Dimitrov 2013, 7). Adaptive change
**[[refers to]{.mark} a complex causal [process that involves
experiencing a shock and then implementing changes]{.mark} in light of
the lessons learned from that shock]{.underline}**. The approach of this
Element bears similarities to those of Shambaugh (2008) and Dickson
(2016) who respectively describe the doctrinal adjustments and practical
steps that have allowed the promotion of private entrepreneurial
activity as a type of adaptive change implemented by the CCP during
reform and opening following the shock of Mao's ill-considered economic
policies. Before we proceed further, we should stress that this Element
does not seek to provide a historical treatment of the evolution of the
CCP (Saich 2021) or of the complex ways in which the CCP manages Chinese
society (Dickson 2021). Its goals are squarely focused on the adaptive
responses the CCP has deployed since 1989 to avert the collapse of the
single-party model of rule in China. Building on existing studies that
highlight individual adaptations, this Element offers a unified
framework for understanding earlier arguments by highlighting the
specific adaptations undertaken in response to 1989. "Adaptation" is
often used loosely in the literature. The Merriam-Webster definition is
"modification of an organism or its parts that makes it more ût for
existence under the conditions of its environment." The definition that
this Element adopts encompasses the policy changes instituted by the CCP
in light of the lessons learned from the shock of 1989, **[which
produced the fundamental insight that communist regimes cannot avoid
collapse without proactive measures]{.underline}**. The focus here is
the specific effects of 1989. **[At the same time, the approach is broad
because it reveals that the [scale of the shock necessitated]{.mark}
learning general lessons which subsequently [led to a set of
wide-ranging adaptation]{.mark}s (of the [economy]{.mark}, of
[welfare]{.mark} provision, of the [ideological]{.mark} sphere,
[and]{.mark} of [party building]{.mark}) that may [appear]{.mark}
unconnected unless one looks at them through the unified prism of the
CCP's reactions to the momentous events of 1989]{.underline}**. **[The
unanticipated [near-collapse]{.mark} of communism [in China and]{.mark}
its surprising demise in two-thirds of the countries constituting the
communist universe [necessitated]{.mark} introducing [comprehensive
measures]{.mark} aimed at ensuring the continued dominance of the CCP.
Our discussion of these adaptive policy responses forms the core of this
Element.]{.underline}**

Chinese economy has slowed down significantly since Covid-19 outbreak.
The average GDP growth rates for the last 5 years have been between 5 to
6%, down from the previous 5 years between 7-9%. Growth in 2024 was 5%.

China's property market, which accounted for 25-30% of GDP most of the
last 2 decades, went through a painful bust. Household wealth, much of
it in properties, declined. Unemployment went up, especially for the
fresh college graduates.

[Another wave of books and [**theories** about **"China
Collapse"**]{.mark} have found eager [audiences in]{.mark} the
**[Western media]{.mark}** and economic circles.]{.underline} Doomsday
sayers abound with [ideas ranging from "demographic disaster" to
"Japanfication". Reputable [economists]{.mark} are making
[forecast]{.mark} how the [Chinese]{.mark} economy may [never **catch
up**]{.mark} with the US.]{.underline}

[The situation is certainly painted [very dire in]{.mark} the
[West]{.mark}ern media.]{.underline} However, for someone who lives [[in
China]{.mark}, [things]{.mark} are **[hardly]{.mark}** that
[alarming]{.mark}.]{.underline} Frankly, it seems most Chinese are
taking things in stride. [[Many]{.mark} are [**quite happy**]{.mark}
with the way things are]{.underline} compared with the go-go days of
2000s and 2010s.

Why the discrepancy in perceptions? What is the true state of the
Chinese economy? How is the slower GDP growth impacting people's lives?

As always, the secret to deciphering China's economic performance and
people's attitude lies in the details. [Most [Western]{.mark} mainstream
[media]{.mark} reports [follow]{.mark} a [meta]{.mark}-narrative [of
**China bashing**]{.mark},]{.underline} making them hardly unbiased
observers. In fact, most of the [economic [theories]{.mark} are [nothing
more than **wishful thinking**]{.mark}]{.underline} for those who want
to see China's progress stalled.

Here are some facts to consider when you poke through the surface and
understand the economic reality in China --

-- GDP contribution of the property industry was a negative 2% in 2024,
meaning the [rest of the Chinese [economy grew **7%**]{.mark} to achieve
a 5% overall growth.]{.underline}

-- Total contribution of the property industry to Chinese GDP has fallen
below 20% from a high of 25-30% a few years ago. This is a [much-needed
rebalancing]{.underline} as more capital and resources are now
[redirected to other productive industries such as green energy and high
tech,]{.underline}

-- Housing prices have fallen between 30 to 40% in most Chinese cities
in the past 5 years. This has a massive downward wealth effect for
property owners, pressuring consumer spending. [But [housing]{.mark} has
become much **[more affordable]{.mark}** for urban
households.]{.underline} Housing sales and rental prices have both
declined.

-- [[**Few** Chinese]{.mark} households have [got]{.mark} into
**[financial crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} from falling housing prices
as average mortgage borrowing is less than 50% of total housing price.
There is a much higher level of downpayment in China than elsewhere
(typically 70-80% borrowing).

-- [Housing sales and [prices]{.mark} have started to
**[stabilize]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the second half of 2024. The
government is planning to buy out the surplus supply and turn them into
low-price affordable housing units.

-- There is little to [**[no]{.mark} consumer [inflation]{.mark}** [in
China]{.mark}]{.underline} in the last 5 years, in sharp contrast with
most other countries, especially the west. Prices for food, automobiles,
consumer goods, electronics, utilities, telecom services, and public
transportation have been flat or declining, especially for new cars. On
the hand, both new and used car prices have risen sharply in both the US
and Europe.

-- [Annual household **[income growth]{.mark}** for the past 5 years was
**[6.5%.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Now a greater proportion of GDP is going
to household income, giving China one of the highest income-to-GDP ratio
globally. Urban retirement income has been raised 3 to 5% annually in
the last decade, far outpacing CPI which is less than 2%.

-- While luxury consumption has declined, affecting businesses such as
LVMH, [middle class [spending]{.mark} has **[not slowed]{.mark}**
down]{.underline}. The average daily calory and protein intake for the
Chinese has overtaken the US, according to WHO. China continues to
import vast quantities of soybean, wheat, beef, seafood, and fruits from
Brazil, Russia, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia.

-- Discretionary [consumer [spending]{.mark} has [bounced back]{.mark}
to **pre-Covid level**,]{.underline} with travel expenditure, education
and entertainment spending on double digit growth. The Chinese
box-office in the 5 days during Chinese New Year last week grew 18% yoy
and reached a record \$1.2 billion. 4 films each grossed more than \$150
million. A record number of 4.2 billion trips is recorded during the
two-week period around Chinese New Year. Most tourist attractions all
over the country are packed back-to-back.

-- Apart from consumer spending[, Chinese global [trade]{.mark} reached
a **[record]{.mark}** of [\$6 trillion]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2024,
with [an **unheard-of** \$[1 trillion surplus]{.mark}.]{.underline}
China is now leading the global auto industry, photovoltaic industry,
solar/wind/hydro/nuclear power industry, robotics, etc.

China has increased its share in global semiconductor industry. China
has even made inroad in the commercial aviation industry with COMAC
taking a bigger share of narrow-body passenger aircraft market.

In fact, I challenge anyone to name a single manufacturing industry
where China has not become more competitive, moved up the value chain,
and gained global market share.

For the average Chinese, the top-line GDP growth number matters little.
I suppose the feeling is shared by the average Americans, who were
barely moved by Biden's so-called high GDP growth in the voting box.

For the average Chinese, the [slower GDP growth has translated into 1)
lower housing cost; 2) little inflation; 3) no impact on real income
growth. I [**doubt** many]{.mark} are [feeling gloom and
doom.]{.mark}]{.underline}

On the other hand, the "high" GDP growth in the US has not benefited the
average Joe-six-pack who must deal with higher housing prices and rents,
high inflation across a full spectrum of products and services,
including big-item spendings in cars, student loans and healthcare.

Once again, if you read [the voodoo [economics from]{.mark} the
[propaganda]{.mark} machine, you will [get]{.mark} the relative economic
[well-being of]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} and the American
**completely [wrong]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Pundits [predicting]{.mark} the [**collapse** of]{.mark} the
[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty have been proven
**[wrong]{.mark}** decade after decade]{.underline}.

Key points:

[The [CCP]{.mark} has figured out ways to **[mitigate]{.mark}** the
[risk]{.mark} of coup[s]{.mark} and revolutions]{.underline}

But China is facing slowing economic growth and an ageing society

Experts say the party could gradually open up politically, on its own
terms

Communist China --- which recently celebrated its 70th birthday --- is
one of the [**[longest running]{.mark}** single-party [regimes]{.mark}
in modern history.]{.underline}

But one-party governments have rarely survived longer than 70 years: the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union ruled for 74 years before the bloc
collapsed in 1991, and Mexico\'s Institutional Revolutionary Party
retained power for 71 years until its defeat in the 2000 elections.

China\'s only contemporary competition is North Korea, which has
been ruled by the Kim family dynasty for 71 years, since its founding in
1948.

Analysts say while there\'s [[**no time limit** on authoritarian]{.mark}
government[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, the CCP\'s one-party rule may not be
sustainable in the long run despite its past resilience and
distinctiveness from other regimes.

But to look at when and how China could eventually undergo political
reform, it\'s important to first understand how the [[CCP]{.mark} has
[kept]{.mark} its [grip on power]{.mark} for so long.]{.underline}

How did the CCP manage to survive this long?

After Mao Zedong\'s death, [limits were placed on presidential terms ---
but those have disappeared under Xi Jinping]{.underline}.

Rory Truex, assistant professor of politics and international affairs at
Princeton University, told the ABC [the [CCP]{.mark} was
**[unique]{.mark}** in terms [of how it]{.mark} has
**[mitigated]{.mark}** the two major [**threats** to]{.mark}
authoritarian [regime]{.mark}s --- coups and revolutions.]{.underline}

To prevent the former, Mr Truex said the party had a system to ensure
the transfer of power from one leader to the next happened \"relatively
peacefully\".

We take a look at President Xi Jinping\'s astonishing tale from his
exiled life in rural China to becoming the most powerful leader since
Chairman Mao Zedong.

Following Chairman Mao\'s death in 1976, the late paramount leader Deng
Xiaoping wrote presidential term limits into China\'s constitution,
recognising the dangers of one-man rule and the cult of personality.

However, a controversial constitutional amendment passed in March
2018 removed the 10-year limit, spread over two five-year terms, so that
[President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping could [rule]{.mark}
**[indefinitely]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the regime has safeguarded itself from a revolution by
\"[governing reasonably well to [keep]{.mark} the **[population
happy]{.mark}**, so they have [no]{.mark} desire to
[revolt]{.mark}\",]{.underline} and through [[controlling
**info**]{.mark}**rmation** and repression]{.underline}, Mr Truex said.

Michael Albertus, co-author of Authoritarianism and the Elite Origins of
Democracy, said the [[CCP staked]{.mark} its [legitimacy on]{.mark}
national **[dev]{.mark}elopment** [and]{.mark} had
**[delivered]{.mark}** on that promise in an **incredible manner**,
[lifting]{.mark} **[half a billion]{.mark}** people [out of
poverty]{.mark} in recent decades.]{.underline}

This year is also earmarked to be \"[a year of decisive victory for the
elimination of poverty]{.underline}\", Mr Xi said in his New Year\'s
speech, as the CCP\'s self-imposed 2020 deadline looms.

\"We will finish building a moderately prosperous society in all
respects and realise the first centenary goal,\" he said on state TV.

Over the last 40 years, [[China]{.mark} has transformed from being one
of the world\'s [poorest nations to]{.mark} the **[second-biggest
economy]{.mark}** on earth, thanks to its economic reform and opening up
policies.]{.underline}

The [[Chinese]{.mark} Government uses [censorship]{.mark} to control
information]{.underline}. (Reuters)

At the same time [[Beijing]{.mark} has used its power to censor and
[eliminate]{.mark} what it [s]{.mark}ees as [threats to]{.mark} its
**[legitimacy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Mr Truex noted the Communist Party was arguably \"[the [most
**sophisticated** regime]{.mark}]{.underline}\" in terms of [repression
and [controlling]{.mark} and distorting information with the use of the
internet, technology, censorship and [propaganda]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"[The takeaway is that this is a **[smart]{.mark} authoritarian**
[regime]{.mark}, and they\'ve **[figured out]{.mark}** the [threat
to]{.mark} their [power and]{.mark} managed to [mitigate]{.mark} those
threats,\"]{.underline}

Mr Truex said.

\"But there is some evidence that some of this might be changing under
Xi Jinping, and some of the things that actually made the Communist
Party strong might be eroding under his rule.\"

China\'s sweeping economic process transformed it from one of the
poorest nations to the second-biggest economy in the world.

Mr Albertus said the CCP was also strong in part because it had
\"vanquished its chief foe\", the Kuomintang (KMT) --- also known as the
Chinese Nationalist Party.

The KMT ruled China for more than two decades, before its defeat at the
hands of the communists at the end of the civil war in 1949.

The KMT subsequently fled to Taiwan, where it was the sole ruling party
until 2000, when it was defeated by the Democratic Progressive Party
after a period of transition towards democracy.

\"To be sure, [\[the **[CCP]{.mark}**\] has had real moments of
weakness]{.underline},\" he said, citing the Tiananmen Square massacre
as an example.

\"But it has [**[evolved]{.mark}** to [develop]{.mark} a coherent and
hierarchical [organisation]{.mark}, and many CCP members have a stake in
its persistence and predictability.\"]{.underline}

What causes a one-party regime to crumble?

In 2013, Larry Diamond, a renowned democracy scholar at Stanford
University, wrote that China was approaching an age that has often
proved fatal to other single-party regimes.

He called it the \"70-year itch\" --- a phenomenon [[China]{.mark} was
[facing]{.mark} \"after a period of authoritarian [**success** rather
than failure]{.mark}\"]{.underline}.

And there are [many reasons why the [regime]{.mark} continues to
[**survive** while others]{.mark} have
**[collapsed]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The Cold War\'s end offers valuable lessons on how to end hostile
conflict in a peaceful way]{.underline} --- and why luck matters more
than you think.

The [[contrast between]{.mark} [China]{.mark} today [and]{.mark} the
[Soviet Union]{.mark} before its collapse couldn\'t be more
**[stark]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

By the time Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in
1985, the economy was already in decline, and his aim was to revive it
with two major reforms: perestroika and glasnost (economic reform and
political opening).

Sarah Percy, an associate professor of international relations at the
University of Queensland, wrote recently that the economic reforms
invited public criticism --- but \"the problem with allowing some
criticism is that it becomes impossible to control\".

\"Once people were allowed to speak out in some areas, they inevitably
began to do so in others, challenging the state\'s control over
political issues as well as economic ones,\" she wrote.

Glasnost opened up a Pandora\'s box of free speech, with decreased media
censorship allowing criticism of government officials.

[[Chinese]{.mark} social [media]{.mark} is the most
[popular]{.mark}]{.underline} news source for international students,
but it is [[also]{.mark} full of **[fake news]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Here\'s some of the tall tales doing the rounds.

Maria Repnikova, a political scientist at Georgia State University, told
the ABC the collapse of the Soviet Union turned it into an
\"anti-model\" for the Chinese regime.

\"\[It\'s\] something that the party-state in part blames on
Gorbachev\'s shock therapy reform that yielded a dramatic and
uncontrollable political opening,\" she told the ABC.

\"That\'s something that the \[People\'s Republic of China\] wants to
avoid at all costs through a combination of responsiveness and pervasive
control.\"

Ms Repnikova, author of the book Media Politics in China, says Beijing
has been obsessed with grasping and guiding public opinion, managing
crises with large-scale exposés in both traditional and social media.

How is the CCP different from other one-party regimes?

Experts also [attribute the longevity of the [CCP\'s rule]{.mark} to its
ability [to]{.mark} learn and adapt]{.underline}.

Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies and director of the Lau China
Institute at King\'s College London, noted the party was flexible in
that it wasn\'t \"too strung up on ideology\".

For example, when the CCP was at its lowest ebb during the Cultural
Revolution in the mid-70s, [[party]{.mark} leaders
\"**[regenerated]{.mark}** themselves\" [by]{.mark} [focusing on]{.mark}
the **[economy]{.mark}**,]{.underline} he said.

Professor Brown said their [idea of [socialism]{.mark} with \"Chinese
characteristics\" was also \"absolutely core\" [because]{.mark} it meant
[it was]{.mark} [unlike]{.mark} any [other system]{.mark}.]{.underline}

China started its economic reform some 40 years ago. 

While North Korea\'s one-party rule is also quite distinctive, with the
[[Kim]{.mark} family dynasty functioning almost like a monarchy, its
notoriously [closed-off]{.mark} political system has severely limited
any opportunities for [economic growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"I\'ve always thought that North Korea today resembles in some sense
China under Mao,\"

Mr Truex said.

\"You might call it totalitarian, where the party itself has complete
control over peoples\' lives and \[is\] in complete control over the
flow of information.\"

At first glance, Pyongyang does seem like the socialist fairyland the
Kim dynasty always dreamed it would be --- but it quickly becomes clear
things are a lot more complicated.

Graeme Smith from the Australian National University said the CCP
realised very early on --- even before it came to power in 1949 --- that
having regular purges to purify the Party\'s ranks was not going to work
as a long-term strategy.

He said in Cambodia, purges contributed to the toppling of Khmer Rouge
leader Pol Pot.

A Wilson Centre paper examining the CCP\'s relationship with the Khmer
Rouge in the 1970s said Deng Xiaoping criticised Pol Pot for the
party\'s \"excessive radicalism\", adding that its \"leftist\"
tendencies --- in particular the purges --- had \"compromised its
ability to repel the Vietnamese military attacks\".

While the CCP had also purged a large number of party members in the
past, it later turned its sights on a party rectification strategy.

\"If you\'re found to be ideologically suspect or have engaged in
activities the party doesn\'t approve of, then efforts will be made to
\[make\] you right,\"

Dr Smith explained.

\"\[It\'s\] the idea that all cadres are basically good and they could
be reformed by thought work.\"

But Dr Smith added [that Mr [Xi\'s]{.mark} signature [anti-corruption
campaign]{.mark} on so-called \"tigers and flies\"]{.underline} --- a
slang phrase referring to high-ranking officials and local civil
servants --- had made him many enemies since he became President.

He said this would include some powerful people who may in the future
come after him.

Will Beijing become the exception to the rule?

The longevity of parties and dictatorships depend on whether they can
maintain popular support, experts say. (Reuters: Damir Sagolj)

Dr [Diamond from Stanford University told the ABC that while there was
**[no \"iron law\"]{.mark}** dictating that one-party regimes must
collapse]{.underline} after 70 or 80 years, he also didn\'t believe
Communist one-party rule was sustainable in the long run.

\"On the other hand, [Communist Party rulers are keenly looking forward
to the **[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty** becoming
the **[most powerful]{.mark}** political [force]{.mark} in the world [in
**2049**]{.mark}]{.underline}, when the regime would turn 100, and I
don\'t think that will happen,\" he said.

\"While the political effects of modernisation have been slowed and
delayed by multiple factors, including the regime\'s intense management
of information and Orwellian levels of repression and surveillance, the
regime faces the same long-run contradiction that other autocracies
have.\"

Beijing announces one of the most significant developments in its Social
Credit System ahead of a planned nationwide rollout of its controversial
behavioural engineering system pegged for 2020.

Dr Diamond says people\'s values change when they have more income and a
higher level of education, and eventually \"they want more autonomy,
more dignity, more freedom and more control over their own lives\".

\"A lot of people are leaving, or have left, because they can\'t get
this freedom and autonomy in China --- certainly not now under the
tightening grip of Communist Party control,\" he said.

\"It\'s true that some people are returning for the Thousand Talents
Program or related opportunities ... it\'s also true that there has been
a [recent [surge in **nationalism** among]{.mark} the
**[young]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\"Still, if I were the CCP, I would be concerned about the
\[longer-running\] trends, and the basic contradictions in the system.\"

China has one of the fastest ageing societies in the world, experts
say. (Reuters: Kim Kyung-Hoon)

Anne-Marie Brady, a professor in Chinese politics at the University of
Canterbury, says the big question is whether the CCP can continue to
provide economic benefits for the Chinese population.

\"Growth has \[slowed\] in China and they have the fastest ageing
society in the world,\" she said.

[China\'s new hottest app on the block is a [propaganda]{.mark} resource
that teaches \"Xi Jinping thought\" and **[requires]{.mark}** the
Communist [Party\'s 90 million members]{.mark} to [read]{.mark} it
[daily]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"Chinese banks have bad debts, the actual unemployment figures are
censored, \[and\] inflation is very high.\"

Dr Diamond believes China\'s \"demographic implosion\" --- fuelled by
China\'s now-abolished one-child policy --- will be hard to reverse
without significant immigration.

\"But how can China do that on a large enough scale?\" he said.

\"I think its efforts to encourage higher population growth will fail
because there are still serious quality of life problems in China.

\"The rapid ageing of the population is going to challenge every aspect
of the \'China dream\'.\"

What will China\'s political system look like in the future?

Xi Jinping said China\'s people\'s democracy is a type of
\"whole-process\" democracy. (AP: Mark Schiefelbein)

Dr Diamond sees the CCP facing \"corruption up and down the system\" but
says there is a \"fundamental contradiction\" in trying to solve it.

\"There is no way to control corruption except through a rule of law
(not rule by law), and that requires separating the Communist Party from
the state and the judiciary,\" he said.

\"But if the CCP no longer reigns supreme over the state and the
judiciary it risks losing control.

\"This is a dilemma that the CCP cannot resolve except by moving toward
democracy.\"

Despite Xi Jinping\'s sweeping anti-corruption campaign, patients
continue to slip doctors thousands of dollars in red envelopes.

While no-one knows for sure whether China will ever become a democracy,
complete with universal suffrage, the CCP certainly hasn\'t shied away
from using the word.

During a tour in Shanghai in November, Mr Xi said China\'s democracy was
a type of \"whole-process\" democracy.

Mr Truex said the Communist Party frequently used the language of
democracy --- except it\'s not democracy as the West knows it.

\"If you use Chinese citizen surveys, for example, the majority will say
they live in a democratic system, even though most people would label
China as authoritarian,\" he said.

\"So the [word [\'democracy\']{.mark} is sort of [corrupted]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} some sense in [China]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

He added that while Western countries tended to equate democracy with
elections, China was trying to increase citizen participation in
politics in a number of different ways.

For example, he said many local governments have so-called \"mayor\'s
mailboxes\" where people can lodge a complaint online, and the public is
also allowed to give feedback when a law is passed.

\"There\'s a lot of other processes in place where basically citizens
are allowed to voice their grievances or voice their perspectives on
policies,\" he said.

\"\[But\] it\'s unclear whether the government actually takes these into
account ... or whether they\'re window dressing.\"

But Mr Albertus said the CCP could go down a similar path to the KMT in
Taiwan, which opened up political contestation gradually on its own
terms.

After the KMT\'s flight to Taiwan in 1949, it was the sole ruling party
before shifting to democracy in 1996, when the island held its first
direct presidential election.

The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected for the first time in
2000.

Beijing is spending billions training up foreign journalists, buying up
space in overseas media, and expanding its state-owned networks on an
unprecedented scale.

However, he said it would have to have some impetus to make this move,
and it was most likely to come from a rising political threat it cannot
necessarily control.

\"Anticipating a major challenge to its rule in five or 10 years could
push it to try to transition to democracy on its own terms,\" he said.

\"That could come, as in many other countries, from a rising middle
class that starts to demand representation and greater freedoms separate
from economic security.

\"But at this point, the [[CCP]{.mark} is likely --- and correctly ---
estimating that **[threat]{.mark}** to be **[far]{.mark}** enough into
the future that it does not need to reform]{.underline} today.\"

### U---Xi Regime Collapse Inev

#### Xi collapse [inevitable]{.underline}.

**Chang '25** \[Gordon G. Chang, J.D @ Cornell, Lawyer and Journalist,
3-19-2025, \"China's military is going to war against itself\", Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5200874-chinese-military-crisis-xi-jinping/
\*\*brackets from original text\] yc

In what could be the most dangerous developments in the world today,
**[[the Chinese military is tearing itself apart.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Xi Jinping has been purging officers for more than a decade. But
[**[other officers]{.underline}**,]{.mark} it appears, **[are [now
purging Xi's loyalists]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The main propaganda organ
of the People's Liberation Army is printing pieces openly criticizing
his rule.

**[The Chinese military is apparently embroiled in its [worst crisis
since Marshal Lin Biao died]{.mark} in a mysterious plane [crash in
1971]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Lin fled **[either [after a failed coup
attempt]{.mark} or after being blamed for one.]{.underline}**

Gen. **[He Weidong, the number [three-ranked uniformed officer, was
reportedly detained on March]{.mark}]{.underline}** 11, after the end of
Beijing's major political event of the year, the so-called Two Sessions.
So far, there is no confirmation of the initial report on this by
citizen journalist Zhao Lanjian.  

"Gen. **[He was [instrumental in Xi's earlier purges]{.mark} in the
military, so his disappearance, if confirmed, could [indicate a great
threat to Xi's authority]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Charles Burton of the
Sinopsis think tank told me. 

The news of the disappearance of He, the second vice chairman of the
Communist Party's Central Military Commission and former commander of
the all-important Eastern Theater Command, has been accompanied by other
unconfirmed reports last week of **[[sackings of senior
officers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For instance, Gen. Zhao Keshi, a former
member of the commission, may have been formally arrested. 

The possible detentions of He and Zhao follow a Financial Times report
of other demotions immediately before the Two Sessions, the annual
meetings of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference. 

Journalist Jennifer Zeng, in a March 13 X post asked if **["[factional
struggle within the military entered a new
phase]{.mark}?" ]{.underline}**

The answer is almost certainly "yes." 

**[Xi Jinping]{.underline}**, since being named general secretary of the
Communist Party in November 2012, **[has [purged officers --- ostensibly
for "corruption" --- and restructured the P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy]{.underline}**. Both moves resulted in
his taking firm control of the military.  

Yet two recent waves of **[purges]{.underline}** --- the first beginning
in 2023 and ending in the middle of last year and the second beginning
in November of last year --- have **[[targeted officers loyal to
Xi]{.mark} in two factions, the [Shaanxi Gang and the Fujian
Clique.]{.mark}  ]{.underline}**

There are two likely explanations for the recent targeting of Xi
loyalists. First, Xi could have become a Stalin-like paranoid and is
taking down people he previously selected. Second, **[[Xi's enemies
might be removing Xi's officers.]{.mark}  ]{.underline}**

Of the two, the second explanation is more likely. Why? Because **[while
Xi loyalists were being removed, [PLA Daily]{.mark}, the Chinese
military's main propaganda organ, ran a series of articles praising
"[collective leadership," a direct rejection of Xi's continual calls for
unity and centralization of control.]{.mark}  ]{.underline}**

These articles, which began appearing last July, were **[written by
those aligned with the top-ranked uniformed officer, [C]{.mark}entral
[M]{.mark}ilitary [C]{.mark}ommission Vice Chairman Gen. Zhang
Youxia]{.underline}**. The propaganda pieces **[could not have appeared
if Xi [were in complete control of the
military.]{.mark}]{.underline}**  

"What is starting to become purge season around the regime's Two
Sessions should be a warning that all is not well in China," Blaine
Holt, a retired Air Force general, told me this month.  

"The extraordinary successive purging of such a high proportion of
senior military officials suggests that this is more than just rooting
out of corruption and associated ills," Burton points out. "**[[Severe
dissatisfaction with Xi's rule]{.mark} by significant factions of the
[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty and of the Party's
People's Liberation Army suggests that the [current leadership of China
faces an existential threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark} 

**[[Xi's weakening hold over the military]{.mark}, which reports to the
Communist Party and not to the Chinese state, complicates the
situation]{.underline}**. Whoever is controlling the purges --- Xi or
his political enemies --- **[[the Chinese military does not look either
stable or loyal to China's paramount leader.]{.mark}  ]{.underline}**

The spate of confirmed disappearances of senior officers since 2023 is
unusual, and the new rumors are especially troubling. Even if all the
fresh rumors are untrue --- possible --- the fact that they are
circulating tells us that there are **[elements trying to destabilize
the Chinese ruler.]{.underline}**  

**[A Xi under siege could decide to lash out.]{.underline}** As Holt
points out, "**[Danger to the regime could have global consequences as
[Xi and the \[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty\]
[consider options to save themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}**." 

There is a lot we do not know, so anything can happen at this moment.
**[The [Chinese regime, as it goes to war against itself, can now take
the world by surprise]{.mark}.  ]{.underline}**

Legitimacy Under Pressure

**[The [CCP's]{.mark} capacity to endure pain is formidable, but pain
alone cannot sustain [legitimacy]{.mark}. The party's long-term
authority [rests]{.mark} not just [on]{.mark} control or propaganda, but
on its [ability to maintain credibility across
generations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[To bolster that credibility, Xi Jinping's administration has leaned
heavily on [discipline and centralization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet
the cost of this top-down rigidity is growing. A system that prizes
loyalty above flexibility risks alienating a society that increasingly
values opportunity, dignity, and transparency. What once were powerful
tools of consolidation -- discipline, sacrifice, central planning --
**[are [now]{.mark} also [sources of alienation for a new class]{.mark}
of digital natives.]{.underline}**

China's international posture further complicates the picture. While
exports to ASEAN and the EU have cushioned the loss of U.S. markets,
global perceptions of China are hardening. Western policymakers may
overestimate the leverage of tariffs and sanctions, but they
underestimate the internal toll that prolonged strategic decoupling will
inflict on Chinese society and the political finesse required to manage
it.

Endurance Without Enthusiasm?

The CCP has turned hardship into a governing principle. It frames
economic difficulty as evidence of national dignity and hardship as
heroic. This strategy allows China to absorb pressure without appearing
to retreat. But it also raises a more profound question: Can legitimacy
thrive on sacrifice alone?

**[If the 2025 trade conflict is any indication, [China's]{.mark}
ability to endure pain remains robust, but its [ability to inspire
enthusiasm is less certain. Young Chinese are]{.mark} not revolting, but
they are [increasingly indifferent.]{.mark} They may [not]{.mark}
challenge the state, but neither are they [convinced]{.mark} by its
[slogans.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The [CCP's]{.mark} future [strength]{.mark} will [hinge]{.mark} not
just on resilience, but [on relevance. If it cannot]{.mark} modernize
its message to meet a more skeptical, self-aware society, then its most
loyal asset, [public]{.mark} patience, may slowly [slip beyond
reach.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Chinese collapse is [inevitable]{.underline}.

**Elliott 23-** Economics Editor at The Guardian, CBE, Fitzwilliam
College Cambridge

(Larry, \"China is too big for a Soviet Union-style collapse, but it's
on shaky ground\", The Guardian, 8-20-2023,
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/20/china-too-big-soviet-union-collapse-growth//phs-FM)

[[China's **economy** is]{.underline}]{.mark} going through a
**[[rough]{.underline}]{.mark}** patch. [[**Growth** is
**slowing**]{.mark} and its [**property**
**bubble**]{.mark}]{.underline} has well and truly
**[[burst]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**[Unemployment]{.mark}** is
**[rising]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So what, you might say? Every country has difficult periods when past
excesses catch up with it. Eventually the economic cycle turns and
recovery begins. China is the world's second biggest economy and has
grown at a stupendous pace over the past four decades. It plays a
pivotal role in the global economy and has invested heavily in advanced
manufacturing and AI. Sure, it has problems but it will emerge from them
relatively unscathed.

But there are countries that never recover. [The [**Soviet** **Union**
was a **command** **economy** that collapsed]{.mark}]{.underline}
rapidly [at the end of the **[1980s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In
**retrospect**, [it was easy to see]{.mark}]{.underline} why the
terminal crisis was going to happen, [[but it didn't look that
way]{.underline}]{.mark} when the Kremlin was deploying SS20 missiles
across eastern Europe [a few years earlier]{.underline}.

So here's the alternative view. [[China's **economic** **miracle** is
over]{.underline}]{.mark}. What's been happening in the past week --
[the [**weakness** of]{.mark} the **[currency]{.mark}**, the [fall in
**prices**]{.mark}, the [**financial** **stress**]{.mark} evident
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**residential**
**[housing]{.mark}**]{.underline} sector -- are all signs of a deeper
malaise that will [[require]{.underline}]{.mark} the ruling Communist
party to undertake [[**structural** **economic** **changes**
that]{.underline}]{.mark} will **[[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
[**[loosening]{.mark}**]{.underline} of [rigid [**political**
**control**]{.mark}]{.underline}. China's leader, [**[Xi]{.mark}**
Jinping, [is a]{.mark} self-styled [**strongman** who will
not]{.mark}]{.underline} be prepared to [[make]{.mark} any
[**concessions** to **freedom** and **democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Sooner or later, **[[China will go the way of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This sounds far-fetched, which it is, to an extent. The Soviet Union was
a far smaller economy than China and was far less integrated into global
supply chains. China matters to the world economy in a way the Soviet
Union never did.

As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research points out, China has generated 41% of
the world's growth in the past 10 years, almost double the 22%
contribution from the US, and dwarfing the 9% contribution from the euro
area.

"Put another way, of the 2.6% real growth rate of the world economy
through the past 10 years, China has generated 1.1 percentage points,
while the US and euro area have generated just 0.6 points and 0.2 points
respectively."

[[China made]{.mark} up such a big slug of **global** **growth** because
its]{.underline} economy was growing at about [8-[**9**% a
year]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Its **growth** [**rate** is now
**half**]{.mark}]{.underline} that -- which means its contribution will
also have halved to about 0.5 points. What's more, its [**growth**
**rate** is [likely to **fall** further in]{.mark} the [years]{.mark} to
come]{.underline}. There are some economists who think its trend rate of
growth will be about 2% by the end of the decade, similar to that of the
US.

These forecasts may all be wildly premature. Beijing's aim is to have
slower but better balanced and more sustainable growth, and the logic of
that is that policymakers should avoid slashing interest rates, boosting
state spending and bailing out an overextended property sector at the
first hint of trouble. The bullish case for China is that its model of
limited economic freedom coupled with political repression have worked
since the Deng reforms of the late 1970s and will continue to work in
the future given some recalibration.

When he took power in the Soviet Union in 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev had a
twin-tracked approach: "glasnost" was the drive for openness and
transparency while "perestroika" was the restructuring of the economy to
end a long period of stagnation. The Soviet Union's collapse was the
result of more progress being made on glasnost than perestroika,
something China's leaders learned from. They pushed ahead with
restructuring but were much less interested in glasnost.

Until now[, ranking **economic** [**growth** over **democracy** has
delivered]{.mark}]{.underline} for China, yet despite the insistence
from Beijing's policymakers that all will continue to be well, [there is
**[evidence]{.mark}** to [suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} those bearish of
China's [**growth** **[prospects]{.mark}** [are
right]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is not just that the expected strong
recovery following the lifting of pandemic lockdown restrictions has
fizzled out, because [the [**economy** was]{.mark}]{.underline} already
displaying signs of [**[sluggish]{.mark}ness** even [before
**Covid**-]{.mark}]{.underline}19 came along.

Writing in Foreign Affairs, Adam Posen, the president of the Petersen
Institute for International Economics, said China had been suffering
from "economic long Covid" since the middle of the last decade.

Since 2015, bank deposits as a share of China's GDP have risen by 50%.
[[Private]{.mark}-sector [**consumption** of]{.mark} **durable**
**[goods]{.mark}** is [down by]{.mark}]{.underline} about [[a
**third**]{.underline}]{.mark} versus early 2015, and has continued to
decline since the reopening of the economy rather than rise as a result
of pent-up demand. [**Private** **[investment]{.mark}** is [down by
**two-thirds**]{.mark}]{.underline} since the first quarter of 2015,
including a decrease of 25% since the pandemic started.

"Those [[trends]{.mark} [reflect]{.mark} people's [**long**-**term**
**economic** decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the aggregate, and [they
strongly suggest that]{.underline} in China, [people and companies are
[increasingly **fearful** of losing]{.mark} access to their
**[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} and are [[prioritising
short-term]{.mark} **liquidity** [over
**investment**]{.mark},]{.underline}" Posen says. These fears, he adds,
have been heightened by the severity and unrelenting nature of China's
lockdown.

[[China had]{.underline}]{.mark} some serious problems even before
Covid. It had [an [**ageing** **population**]{.mark}]{.underline} and --
despite four decades of rapid growth -- was still only a middle-income
country. Its [[growth]{.underline}]{.mark} rate [was [**inflated**
by]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[wasteful]{.mark} **public**
[**investment** and **subsidies**]{.mark}]{.underline} to uneconomic
enterprises [[that would otherwise have
**collapsed**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

military options against Taiwan]{.underline}. More research is urgently
needed to better understand how weakening state capacity might affect
considerations of the use of force among rival great powers.

Once vaunted as the next superpower, [China has **stumbled** in recent
years]{.underline}. Coronavirus-related restrictions may have eased
after weeks of protests, but now the country appears to be dealing with
a major outbreak of the virus. Beijing's struggles to contain the virus
merely exacerbate a worsening economic situation. [Per-capita **income
growth** has **slowed** to a crawl, and there are few good prospects for
reviving the country's flagging growth]{.underline}. The property
market, which drives about one-third of China's economic activity,
remains deeply troubled. Unemployment for the country's youth has
hovered around 20 percent through most of 2022. Owing to unresolved
structural factors and looming demographic challenges, China's economy
is, accordingly, expected to slow dramatically in coming years,
averaging perhaps 2 to 3 percent annually through mid-century.

The compounding troubles coincide with a dramatic consolidation of power
by Xi Jinping. At the 20th Party Congress, Xi secured a third term as
supreme leader. He has suppressed rivals and elevated repression of
dissent to the highest level since Tiananmen Square. Observers have
noted the many ways in which Xi has imitated Mao Zedong's personalized
style of rule. Xi himself has encouraged the comparison with pilgrimages
to revolutionary historic sites and incessant propaganda that borders on
a cult of personality not unlike Mao. Some experts have claimed that Xi
has gained more power than Mao ever had, noting in particular the
absence of rivals or organized opposition among elites. Xi also presides
over a rapidly modernized military that surpasses---by orders of
magnitude---Mao's People's Liberation Army (PLA) in lethality and
sophistication. By any measure, the PLA is second only to the U.S.
military. China also possesses a large state-controlled defense
industry. Some experts have claimed that Xi's unchallenged political
power and control of such a large economy and modern military make him
"the most powerful man in the world." 

[The combination of a weakening strategic situation and an increasingly
**despotic regime** has left Xi with few constraints on his
power]{.underline}. Many observers fear that a Beijing despondent over
the country's deteriorating situation could risk military adventurism as
a diversion. Analysts warn that the situation could motivate China to
risk aggressive behavior against Taiwan, disputed islands in the first
island chain, and in foreign policy more generally. Russia's invasion of
Ukraine provides a vivid contemporary example of such a danger, but
experts also cite precedents from World War I and II. [Hal
**[Brands]{.mark}** has [warned]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} might
[consider war]{.mark} once it senses that a "**geopolitical window** of
opportunity" may be closing]{.underline}. Moreover, China's own history
provides a precedent in which an internally troubled China carried out a
major war along its periphery. In the early 1950s, an impoverished China
still grappling with internal unrest leftover from the Chinese Civil War
nonetheless undertook a major military intervention in Korea. Supreme
leader Mao Zedong ordered columns of "volunteer" troops to fight
American forces to a stalemate, at the cost of over a million Chinese
casualties. 

[The argument that an increasingly powerful Xi might hope to stave off a
bleak future with **military aggression** appears
compelling]{.underline}. A major flaw in that argument, however, is that
[it [**confuses** Xi's **political strength** with]{.mark} the [Chinese
**state's strength**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [[Xi's
ascent]{.mark} to supreme power has [coincided with a **tremendous
weakening**]{.mark} of the Chinese state]{.underline}. It is the state's
weakness, not Xi's personal strength, that will most profoundly
determine whether and how China can fight against Taiwan and the United
States. 

The strength of the state matters in particular for China because of the
types of conflicts most commonly envisioned for war involving Taiwan.
The U.S. Department of Defense has outlined several possible options,
including a joint blockade, a seizure of an offshore island like Kinmen,
and a large-scale invasion of the island. Since the U.S. could intervene
in any China-Taiwan fight, Beijing would need to prepare for war with
the U.S. for any of the options. Combat between U.S. and Chinese forces
near the island could involve large numbers of troops, ships, aircraft,
and other capabilities---and could result in a massive conflict that
proves enormously destructive, as many war games have suggested. 

The scale and scope of a potential war near Taiwan carries important
implications for China's politics. [Any state can initiate hostilities,
but **[large-scale wars]{.mark}**, such as the ones described,
**[require strong states]{.mark}**. A strong state is one that is
[regarded by its people as **legitimate**]{.mark}, that has a
well-developed and relatively **efficient government bureaucracy**, a
prosperous economy, responsive politics, and adequate
infrastructure]{.underline}. Strong states [have the [capacity and
resources to wage]{.mark} large-scale [war due to their ability to
efficiently mobilize]{.mark} available **labor**, political **support**,
and resources.]{.underline} The U.S., Japan, and the principal European
combatants in World War I and II all had strong states. They were able
to raise powerful armies, mobilize their entire societies, fight
large-scale conventional battles, and sustain a war footing for years. 

[Such large-scale [**conventional war** is beyond]{.mark} the [capacity
of weak or weakened states]{.mark}. Weak states are those [characterized
by]{.mark}]{.underline} high levels of social disorder, unresponsive
politics, weak economies, high levels of corruption, inadequate
infrastructure, and an inconsistent rule of law. Such states tend to
have [a [**low** level of **legitimacy** in the eyes of their
people]{.mark}.]{.underline} Accordingly, there is likely to be a high
potential for internal political opposition or resistance to state
demands. Militaries in such countries tend to feature high levels of
corruption, low morale, intercommunal tension, and inconsistent
performance on the battlefield. When they fight, weak states often favor
mercenaries as both more cost effective and reliable than national
militaries. A weakened state with a modern military might be capable of
pulling off small-scale attacks against clearly inferior adversaries, as
Iraq prevailed against Kuwait and as Russia did in Georgia, Syria, and
Chechnya. But they lack the administrative and organizational capacity
to sustain large-scale conventional combat against more capable
adversaries[. [**Russia**'s troubles in]{.underline}]{.mark} [sustaining
its war effort in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**, for example, [owe in part to
many **weaknesses** in **state legitimacy**]{.mark} and administrative
capacity]{.underline}. In [weak states located in **Africa**, operations
tend to be **smaller scale** and consist of **irregular operations**,
often against domestic insurgents]{.underline}. Unmanned systems offer
another appealing alternative for weak states that lack resources and
access to reliable and effective militaries. 

Given this information, is Xi a strong or weak ruler? Paradoxically, he
is both stronger and weaker than his predecessors. Within the highest
echelons of China's central government, Xi appears to be more powerful
than Mao. Xi's relentless accrual of central power has been accompanied
by a surprising lack of opposition among elites. Having consolidated
control over the party, government, and military, he appears
unchallenged and, at least in regards to his anti-corruption campaign,
he appears popular with the public. No rival has dared to defy him. By
contrast, Mao routinely contended with powerful rivals who openly
opposed him, such as Liu Shaoqi. As a result, the central leadership
experienced frequent power struggles and political violence. By the
measure of control over the state, Xi surpasses all of his predecessors,
including Mao.

#### A [weakening]{.underline} of state [legitimacy]{.underline} decreases Xi's [risk tolerance.]{.underline}

yc

Further, China does not have a clear path to building a strong state.
With Maoist ideology discredited and the economy incapable of sustaining
the soaring growth rates of the Deng years, the [[CCP's
**legitimacy**]{.mark} increasingly [rests on its ability to
satisfy]{.mark} an increasingly diverse [set of demands]{.mark} by the
people]{.underline}. Yet by the party's own admission, it cannot meet
these needs. In 2021, Xi noted that the "people's aspirations for a
better life have generally shifted from 'Is there enough?' to 'Is it
good enough?'" But Xi's remarks provide little hope for optimism. In a
speech published in January 2022, Xi Jinping stated grimly that Chinese
officials must not "get people's hopes up by making promises that we are
not able to keep." Nor does Beijing have the luxury of hiding its state
weakness by distributing rent from a single source of revenue to buy
elite and popular support, as Russia has done with its mineral revenues.

The reality of [a [**weakened** Chinese **state** carries]{.mark} three
[important implications]{.mark} for Beijing's potential use of force
against Taiwan.]{.underline} First, [the [country's **tolerance** for
casualties will likely **decline**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second,
[Beijing's [tolerance for high costs of wa]{.mark}r will
[decline]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, [Beijing's [tolerance for **risk**
will likely decline.]{.mark}]{.underline} 

As for the first point---the public's increasing sensitivity to
casualties---calls for patriotic self-sacrifice will ring increasingly
hollow to a populace that receives little benefit from the government.
Efforts to whip up public enthusiasm for a war that requires immense
sacrifices are unlikely to work. After all, the CCP has invested
enormous resources to bolster popular support for Xi and the government,
with disappointing results. Officials concede that the propaganda is
unlikely to succeed on its own and that material incentives are required
to extract at least the appearance of public support. China is already
wary of reporting casualties. In its operations abroad, Chinese military
forces have acted with considerable caution, refraining from risky
operations and downplaying casualties from the violent brawl that
occurred with India. Authorities have also obscured data on the number
of casualties from the coronavirus due in part to fears over the impact
that such disclosures could have on the government's legitimacy. 

Accordingly, [[military options for Taiwan will have to be
**scaled**]{.mark} to what the public is willing to endure. [The Chinese
people]{.mark} may take pride in key national
accomplishments]{.underline}, such as hosting the Olympics, lunar
expeditions, and technological achievements, but are [[not likely to
eagerly back imperial adventures]{.mark} that might **[cost them
dearly]{.mark}**. Studies show]{.underline} that [[Chinese people
overwhelmingly **oppose war**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Whether
nationalism is truly on the rise remains unclear. Sentiments among
[[Chinese **youth** appear to include a complex set of views]{.mark}
with only a **[minority]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[hawkishly
supporting]{.mark} a more **[militant
nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But studies show that the situation
is even more complex than that, with much sentiment resting in between
support and opposition to the regime. China could, perhaps, overcome
this limitation by depending more on volunteers and contractors who
fight for pay as much as they do for the country. In fact, China already
relies primarily on volunteers for its military and security contractors
to protect its overseas interests. China has already invested enormously
in unmanned aircraft and automated systems, the appeal of which could
grow, since the loss of robots will be less politically sensitive than
uniformed casualties.

 A weakened state also raises the salience of resource constraints. A
ruinous war leaving the PLA in tatters would destroy a key pillar of
Beijing's prestige---the creation of a strong military. More
importantly, China also faces enormous challenges in accessing the
nation's resources to fund and sustain a large-scale war. Unlike Russia,
which can simply extract resources from mineral production, China's
diverse economy relies on taxes from corporations, citizens, and
commerce. Accordingly, strategies of total mobilization have become more
difficult for China as they are for all other late industrial societies.
Military service is unpopular among urban educated youths, despite a
dearth of jobs. Resistance to conscription has grown to such an extent
that the State Council issued regulations in 2016 outlining penalties
for refusal to serve. Further, tax efficiency is notoriously low, owing
in part to extensive corruption. The country's high levels of inequality
make it necessary to levy taxes most heavily on powerful, well-resourced
elites who may resist such measures. Not surprisingly, Chinese laws and
writings on "defense mobilization" use the term to describe a more
limited effort than the classic mobilizations of "total wars," such as
those of World War II. These limitations will constrain China's military
options against Taiwan. With mobilization for total war looking less
unlikely at this point, Beijing might find more appealing coercive
options that rely heavily on nonmilitary and nonkinetic methods, such as
economic coercion, diplomatic pressure, and propaganda. Military
operations could augment such efforts in the cyber, information, and
psychological warfare domains. Military exercises, drills, and other
forms of intimidation and coercion could be useful as well, especially
for a weakened regime. In fact, China is already carrying out many of
these activities. If Beijing eventually decides that a military
intervention is necessary, any large-scale attack could exceed the
state's strength. Further, a large-scale invasion is especially perilous
due to the risk of attrition and consequent need to mobilize additional
labor and resources. A blockade or smaller scale operations, such as an
offshore island seizure, however, could be more attractive. Yet smaller
scale options, like an island seizure, offer less hope of compelling
Taiwan's submission. The PLA's exercise of a joint blockade during
former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) visit could well
be an indication of China's preferred contingency plans. But even in the
case of an island seizure or blockade, Beijing would need to face the
unappetizing prospect of an uncontrolled escalation should U.S. forces
intervene in a significant way. 

[Being a **[weakened state]{.mark}** will likely [encourage Beijing to
be more **risk averse**]{.mark}. Already, [top leaders routinely
**emphasize**]{.mark} the [importance of **reducing risks**]{.mark}. In
one speech, [Xi stated]{.mark} that the [**CCP** should "take the
**prevention** and **resolution** of major risks" as an "extremely
important task."]{.mark}]{.underline} Beyond speeches, Xi has exercised
caution in his own behavior. Compared to his predecessor, Hu Jintao, Xi
may have staked a bolder defense of the nation's interests. [But [his
willingness to take risks is **often overstated**]{.mark}. It is true
that Xi has overseen the [expansion of "**gray zone**"
operations]{.mark} against rival claimants in the first island
chain.]{.underline} But [these [confrontations have **remained
nonlethal**]{.mark} to date. [**China** and **India** also
clashed]{.mark} in a fatal brawl]{.underline} under Xi's watch, but
[[Beijing subsequently **sought to deescalate
tensions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In short, China under Xi has been
repressive and brutal in many ways, but it has [not engaged in any of
the risky combat operations]{.underline} that Russia practiced for years
against Georgia, Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine in the lead-up to the
Ukraine invasion in 2022. 

[Beijing's [**risk aversion** ]{.mark}]{.underline}may partly reflect
Xi's personal preference, but it more [likely [owes to the **state's
declining** capacity and **legitimacy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The margin
of error is simply thinner today than in the past. [China faces a
perpetually **high** level of **unrest**, underscored by the country's
extensive **reliance** on **repression**. Any shock to the political
economy could generate upheaval]{.underline}. The spread of the
coronavirus pandemic provides a vivid example. Protesters denounced Xi
and the CCP last year when lockdowns hurt the economy and people felt
that their personal freedom was excessively constrained, even though the
government's policies sought to minimize deaths from the virus. Given
the state's already-fragile legitimacy, the shock of war could be regime
ending. After all, it is difficult to envision a riskier act than
starting a war that could involve the U.S. An untested military that
attempts an opposed amphibious landing would carry a high risk of
battlefield failure, the political consequences of which could be
devastating. The possibility that a war with the U.S. could result in
mass death, economic collapse, and escalation to nuclear war cannot be
ruled out either. The risks would be compounded if China attempted to
launch an unprovoked "surprise" attack that refrained from
psychologically and politically preparing the populace for the hardships
of war. Given the enormous risks, [[an **attack** launched by a
**stressed** Beijing would likely **accelerate** its
**collapse**]{.mark} rather than ease any pressure]{.underline}. More
plausibly, Beijing will probably continue to favor nonmilitary and
nonkinetic military methods of pressuring Taiwan if possible. China can
also be expected to maximize efforts to weaken and cut off U.S. support
to Taiwan. If a pressured Beijing someday feels compelled to take
military action against the island, it might favor blockades or punitive
strikes as a last resort after efforts to cajole the U.S. into
co-managing the situation had failed, although even this seems doubtful
given Beijing's disinterest in war with Washington.

In sum, Xi's personal strength may give him a key advantage against his
foes among fellow elites, but, in matters of war, it is an illusion. Xi
and his successors may lament their country's faltering situation, but
[[the **state's weakness** will **constrain** how they respond to a
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although some experts draw comparisons from
the current situation with China and Taiwan to the Central and Axis
Powers in World Wars I and II as reasons to support [[the
"**diversionary war**" idea]{.underline}]{.mark}, they are
[[inappropriate given the difference in **state**
**capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The major combatants in World Wars I
and II were nation-states in their prime. China today is a weakened
state. Russia's invasion of Ukraine may provide an alternative example
of an aggressive declining state, but although shocking, Russia had
telegraphed its intentions years in advance through repeated attacks
against its relatively small, vulnerable neighbors. In China's case,
Taiwan poses a far more formidable target due largely to its security
ties with the U.S. The risks, and demands of the state for war
preparation, are accordingly far greater for China than was ever the
case for Russia.

Paradoxically, China may have more in common with other late industrial
states that are exhibiting disturbing signs of state weakness, including
slowing growth, entrenched inequality, simmering public discontent, and
governance shortfalls. The U.S., Europe, Japan, and others have shown a
general aversion to waging large-scale war in favor of small-scale
contingencies that avoid mobilization and that demand little of the
public. Like the PLA, these militaries are staffed by professional
volunteers and contractors, and the appeal of automated warfare has
grown for them as well. China's politics may be despotic, but that does
not negate shared structural weaknesses of the state that may drive it
in similar directions. [**[Declining state legitimacy]{.mark}** and
capacity [provide strong **incentives** for China to favor **lower risk
options**]{.mark} for military action against Taiwan in a
crisis]{.underline}. If U.S.-China relations turned bitterly
antagonistic, Beijing might consider options to keep Washington at bay
in a Taiwan crisis, such as cyber and information operations to foment
domestic turmoil. But [[how a weakened Beijing might **escalate
conflict**]{.mark} in such a situation without destabilizing [itself is
**far from clear**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More research is urgently
needed to better understand how weakening state capacity might affect
considerations of the use of force among rival powers.

Animosity Helps Autocrats

Besides tightening control at home, **[[autocratic and nationalist
forces under Xi can count on an inadvertent source of support from
overseas: Animosity toward China]{.mark} in the United States. When Xi's
leadership coincided with that of President Trump]{.underline}** from
2016 to 2020, **[U.S.-China relations spiraled downward]{.underline}**.
The Trump administration adopted an \[pp. 86\] openly hawkish stance
toward China, **[casting the PRC as an existential threat and launching
a trade war and bans on technology exports]{.underline}**. At one point,
the Trump administration **[even considered a travel ban on all 92
million CCP members and their families]{.underline}**---which would
include the **[vast majority of elites in China]{.underline}** as well
as outspoken critics of authoritarian practices who are part of the CCP
(including the public intellectual whom I earlier mentioned).

The eruption of the covid-19 pandemic put already chilly relations into
a deep freeze. The ice between the two countries had not been so thick
since the Tiananmen crisis in 1989. There were consulate closures in
both countries while U.S. and Chinese officials hurled charges back and
forth. **[President Trump insisted on calling the coronavirus "the
Chinese virus" and "kung flu."]{.underline}**25 Anti-China sentiments
spread online, and with them came more anti-Asian hate crimes.26 In May
2022, well after Trump had left office, more than a third of
Asian-American respondents told a Pew survey that they had changed their
daily routines due to fear of being threatened or attacked for their
ethnicity. 27

Public opinion soured on both sides: **[In the United States, negative
attitudes toward China reached historic highs, while a survey of Chinese
adults reported [similarly high levels of negativity toward the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**. What explains these
disturbing trends? "**[In a nutshell, all news about the U.S.-China
relationship has been bad]{.underline}**," Liu, Li, and Fang observe.
More specifically, their study found that "Trump\'s rhetoric and
policies toward China in 2020 had a much bigger role than propaganda in
the worsening Chinese perceptions of the U.S."28 In a similar vein,
another study of Chinese students finds that exposure to racist remarks
is correlated with support for the CCP's authoritarian rule.29

None of this is to deny Xi's increased repression at home and aggression
abroad, or to suggest that it is somehow in the U.S. interest to support
him. **[Yet it remains true that U.S.-China [animosity has made it
easier for Xi to rally the CCP and the nation behind
himself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However justified politicians in the
United States may feel in berating the PRC, they should be aware that
such **[attacks [make firing up Chinese nationalism easier,]{.mark}
especially when hostile remarks do not distinguish between Xi, the CCP,
and the Chinese people]{.underline}**. 30 **[[Tensions with the United
States]{.mark} also [give autocratic forces in the CCP a pretext for
blaming political discontent, from Hong Kong democracy protests to
frustrated Shanghai residents]{.mark}]{.underline}** who banged pots to
protest strict lockdowns**[, [on "foreign
meddling."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

1\. Introduction

Since Deng Xiaoping opened up the Chinese economy in 1978, **[the
[P]{.mark}eople's [R]{.mark}epublic of [C]{.mark}hina]{.underline}**
(PRC) **[has time and again [proven its ability to defy conventional
wisdom]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since then the PRC has enjoyed more than
**[[four decades of unprecedented economic
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, turning it into the second-largest
economy in the world. In the process, nearly 800 hundred million people
have been lifted out of poverty and by 2022, 76% of China's urban
population will have become part of the middle class (Iskyan, 2016; Pan,
2018). Perhaps most astonishing out of all these achievements is still
the fact that China's transition to a quasi-market economy was overseen
and directed by no other than a Communist party still claiming adherence
to the tenets of Marxism. Consequently, there are many scholars who
regard this impressive level of economic growth or more accurately the
collective rise of individual incomes associated with it, as the primary
source of legitimacy for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule in
contemporary China (Dickson, 2016, p. 259).

**[However, what happens if]{.underline}** economic **[performance
eventually falters? Shouldn't any kind of legitimacy derived from it do
the same]{.underline}**? Additionally, there is also the possibility
that the economic and social changes set into motion by growing
prosperity have the potential to turn even an economically successful
authoritarian regime into a victim of its own success. Accordingly,
numerous **[[renowned China experts have repeatedly predicted the
collapse of the Communist regime]{.underline}]{.mark}** in China and
have again and again been proven wrong (Chang, 2001; Pei, 2006;
Shambaugh, 2016). **[[Multiple causes]{.mark} like a [strong popular
desire for stability or a cultural tendency towards conservatism]{.mark}
have been [suggested]{.mark} to explain this puzzle, but arguably [the
most significant cause is]{.mark} the fact that in the last decades even
China's [poorest have experienced an unprecedented rise in their
standard of living]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Particularly, **[[China's
middle class has little interest in destabilizing a system that has
benefited them]{.underline}]{.mark}** and from which they expect
continued performance (Zeng, 2016b, pp. 72--73, 309). Additionally,
while economic performance is arguably the primary source of legitimacy
for the CCP, the party's undiminished popular support even during past
economic downturns might point towards the existence of additional
strands of legitimacy which will be explored in more detail in Chapter
5.

However, with growth slowing down as an inevitable part of China's
economic transition, many of the problems that were concealed by rising
prosperity such as socio-economic inequality or the urban/rural cleavage
might now be coming to the fore again. Thus, this begs the question if
economic performance can still serve as the primary source of legitimacy
for CCP rule, or if the party must now find new sources of legitimacy?
In order to assess this question, I will first establish the theoretical
foundation of performance legitimacy. In the third chapter, I will
provide a quick historical overview of what enabled the emergence of
performance legitimacy in the first place and in the fourth chapter
whether recent developments are undermining its foundation. In the last
part of the paper, I will then discuss possible alternatives sources of
legitimacy for the rule of the Communist party. 2. Performance
Legitimacy in Autocratic Regimes While research on authoritarian regimes
has become one of the fastest-growing areas of comparative politics, it
has only been fairly recently that the subject of autocratic legitimacy
has managed to attract scholarly attention. Consequently, this has led
to a relative dearth of systematic research when it comes to the
legitimation strategies of authoritarian regimes, with most studies on
this issue relying on anecdotal or case-based evidence (Soest and
Grauvogel, 2017, pp. 287--288). This lack of research seems all the more
surprising when considering that from an empirical standpoint all types
of political regimes must justify their rule in order to ensure their
long-term survival (Kailitz and Stockemer, 2017, p. 333). Since not even
autocracies can permanently sustain themselves by relying solely on
repression and co-optation alone. Legitimation should be regarded as a
third crucial pillar that allows an autocratic rule to endure
(Gerschewski, 2013, pp. 18, 30). Yet, how do autocratic regimes
establish their legitimacy? Dukalskis & Gerschewski outline four
distinct mechanisms of autocratic legitimation: ideological
indoctrination, democraticprocedural, passivity, and performance. In the
aftermath of the second world war, autocracy research was dominated by a
focus on the ideological indoctrination component of totalitarian rule.
It was only with the decline of totalitarian regimes that the research
focus has shifted towards the latter three mechanisms. Authoritarian
rulers that utilize the passivity mechanism are less interested in
mobilizing the population than in demobilizing potential opposition by
making the regime appear "unassailable." Conversely, autocracies that
employ the performance mechanism seek to create acceptance or support
for their rule by demonstrating the effectiveness of authoritarian
governance. However, today the most frequently utilized mechanism is the
democratic procedural one because nearly every autocracy holds some form
of elections or at least seeks to demonstrate its responsiveness to the
demands of the citizen's through alternative means (Dukalskis and
Gerschewski, 2017, pp. 253-- 260). Nevertheless, while passivity,
performance, and democratic-procedural can be classified as distinct
mechanisms, there is considerable interaction between them as pointed
out by Cassani as well as Dukalkis and Gerschewski (Cassani and Cassani,
2017, pp. 362--364; Dukalskis and Gerschewski, 2017, pp. 5--6).

More recently, **[the [remarkable resilience of the
CCP]{.mark}]{.underline}** and its potential to serve as a role model
for other authoritarian regimes have directed considerable scholarly
interest towards performance-based legitimacy. Although commonly
associated with economic indicators, Soest and Grauvogel
**[point-out]{.underline}** that **[[performance legitimacy]{.mark} can
also be [derived from the delivery of public goods]{.mark} such as
[education or health care]{.mark}]{.underline}** with Zeng expanding his
definition of the term to include the performance of "all government
function." Moreover, for Radnitz, the concept also encompasses the
public perception of the regime as a "guarantor of stability,
territorial integrity or state-building." This rather broad definition
has naturally become the target of some criticism, but Zeng contends
that there is no better alternative to the term and that performance
legitimacy is especially useful when explaining China's unique situation
(Radnitz, 2012, pp. 71--75; Soest and Grauvogel, 2015, pp. 38--43; Zeng,
2016a, p. 68). A Regime Legitimation Expert Survey on non-democratic
regimes in 98 countries conducted between 1991 and 2010 points to the
centrality of performance legitimacy for autocratic regimes. Since
according to the survey all kinds of authoritarian regimes employ
"performance claims" in order to substantiate their rule -- even when
their actual record is rather questionable (Soest and Grauvogel, 2017,
p. 298).

Thus, the definition of what actually constitutes performance is highly
dependent on the specific circumstances of the regime in question.
Therefore, performance legitimacy cannot be measured by surveying
objective indicators like economic growth or unemployment, but rather if
and to what extent the general population perceives the regime's claims
of improvement to be real. Thus, while "real-world accomplishments" may
make it easier to pursue a performance based legitimacy strategy,
achievements only translate into legitimacy gains when the regime can
successfully frame itself as being "pivotal" to their achievement (Soest
and Grauvogel, 2017, pp. 296--298).

3\. The Foundation of China's Economic Performance

3.1 The Institutionalization of Leadership Transition and Governance

The Reason for what Nathan has termed the **[[CCP's authoritarian
resilience]{.mark} has [been its remarkable adaptability]{.mark} which
can be directly [traced back to Deng Xiaoping's policy of "reform and
opening up]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Nathan, 2003, p. 6; Magnus, 2018, p.
14). Thus, in the following, 5 I will briefly outline what made
**[[China's economic rise possible]{.mark} and by extension enabled the
[emergence of performance legitimacy as the CCP's main source]{.mark} of
legitimacy]{.underline}**. Leadership transition in authoritarian
regimes is always fraught with danger, with the moment of transition
often occurring "ahead or behind the nominal schedule, involving purges
or arrests, factionalism, sometimes violence and opening the door to the
chaotic intrusion into the political process of the masses or the
military." In this, pre-reform China was no exception, with both of the
PRC's "paramount leaders" Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping exercising
"supreme authority" until the end of their lives. Although both
designated multiple successors to their position, all of Mao's and two
Deng's chosen successors were deposed or forced to resign before the
transition of leadership could take place (Nathan, 2003, pp. 7--8).

Despite the continuity, this would seem to imply Deng's assumption of
power in 1978, signified a dramatic shift in the governance of the CCP
and China as a whole. Although Deng also held supreme authority, he
avoided creating a cult of personality around himself like Mao had and
also eschewed one-man rule in favour of a more consensus-driven
management style. Additionally, although Deng's first two selected
successors were forced to resign neither they nor their families were
physically harmed or faced persecution (Minzner, 2018, p. 19). Beginning
with Jiang Zemin in 1989 each of his successors served their full term
in office, but importantly none overstayed it. Jian was the first leader
of the PRC not to choose his own successor instead, the selection of
each new generation of leaders was now made by consensus within the
Politburo -- the central political body of the PRC (Nathan, 2003, pp.
8--10).

Additionally, under Mao and to a certain degree also Deng the
opportunity for advancement within the Communist party had been
dependent on loyalty to the central leader and the ability to adapt to
changing political directives. However, beginning in the 1980s **[the
[CCP began to establish a meritocratic selection and promotion
system]{.mark} for party and government positions]{.underline}**.
Exactly how meritocratic this system is, has become the topic of
considerable academic debate with some studies suggesting that officials
who perform better being promoted more easily (Li and Zhoub, 2005).
While others contend that personal connections also play a role (Shih,
Adolph and Liu, 2012; Jia, Kudamatsu and Seim, 2015). In a study drawing
on comprehensive data from the selection of officials on the provincial,
prefectural and county-level, Landry et al. find that **[the
[meritocratic selection element is strongest on the local
level]{.mark}.]{.underline}** With personal ties and factionalism
becoming more important the further officials move up the administrative
ladder 6 (Landry, Lü and Duan, 2017, pp. 25--26).

Nevertheless, each party member that gains entry into the Politburo is
the product of a 20-year selection process. Therefore, Yang argues that
**[China's selection and promotion system can be classified as open,
competitive and meritocratic]{.underline}** (Yao, 2018, p. 88). **[The
[institutionalization of leadership succession]{.mark} has [allowed the
CCP to eschew most of the dangers associated with the succession of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** outlined at the beginning of this section.
In concert with the regularization of the administrative promotion
system, this has ensured that the regime has at its helm a capable
leadership group, representing different party factions. Thereby,
**[[ensuring that the top-party leadership would be structurally
predisposed towards collective decision making]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Nathan, 2003, p. 20). The capacity for "institutional adjustment and
flexible policy implementation" this has enabled not only **[[guarantees
the regime's political stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** but is also a
critical ingredient to China's unique economic development (Heberer,
2016, p. 622).

4\. Xi's Great Leap Backwards

4.1 The Abandonment of Collective Leadership and Xi's Personalization of
Power

When Xi Jinping came to power in 2012/2013 **[[the "China model]{.mark}"
which had [enabled the PRC's prodigious economic development]{.mark} was
[visibly losing steam]{.mark} -- [a direct threat to the CCP's
performance legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Yet, the administration
or more appropriately the reign of Xi has almost become a mirror image
of the Deng period with many of the mechanisms that made China's
economic growth possible being systematically dismantled. Therefore,
this begs the question if Xi's rise to power marks the end of China's
exceptional form of authoritarian development. When Deng Xiaoping
instituted the principle of collective leadership, he did so because
never again should the flawed decisions of just one man be allowed to
lead China into another disaster like "the Great Leap Forward" or the
"Cultural Revolution." However, **[[Xi]{.mark} seems to have [reached
the conclusion that only by centralizing political power]{.mark} in his
hand can [he hope to succeed in the momentous task of rebalancing the
Chinese economy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Gill, 2017, pp. 6--7).

Like his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, **[[Xi holds]{.mark}
the offices of [general secretary]{.mark} of the [CCP,
commander-in-chief o]{.mark}f China's [armed forces]{.mark} and
naturally also the [state presidency]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However,
over the course of 10 his **[[power consolidation
campaign]{.mark},]{.underline}** he has also acquired a host of
additional titles. Like the **[[chairmanship of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the newly established **[[N]{.mark}ational [S]{.mark}ecurity
[C]{.mark}ommission]{.underline}**, which **[[consolidates all
components of the party's security apparatus]{.mark} into a single
entity]{.underline}** and has been **[[endued with extensive
power]{.mark} over domestic and foreign policy]{.underline}**. Also, of
note is the **[[establishment of several "leading
groups]{.mark}"]{.underline}** that are responsible for the formulation
and implementation of policies across a wide range of areas such as
"Financial and Economic Affairs", "Deepening Reform" or "Cybersecurity."
Thereby putting Xi at the centre of all aspects of Chinese policymaking,
earning him the nickname **["[chairman of
everything]{.mark}"]{.underline}**(Elizabeth C. Economy, 2018, p. 23).

In 2017 this exalted status was officially confirmed when at the 19th
National Congress of the CCP "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era" was included into China's
constitution -- an honour that had previously only been accorded to Mao
and Deng (Elizabeth C Economy, 2018, p. 62). This was even further
reinforced when in the following year the National People's Congress
voted unanimously to end the two-term limit on the presidency. This does
not only mean that Xi Jinping could remain President well beyond the end
of its second term in 2022 but also signifies the final break with the
institutionalized leadership succession model of the past decades
(Düben, 2018, p. 13).

However, **[[Xi Jinping's signature domestic policy initiative
is]{.mark} without a doubt the [largescale anti-corruption drive]{.mark}
he instituted almost immediately after assuming office]{.underline}**.
What distinguished his **[[anti-corruption
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark}** from those of his predecessors was its
**[[all-encompassing and continuous]{.mark} nature]{.underline}**, with
more than **[[one million officials]{.mark} and party members being
[disciplined]{.mark}]{.underline}** until 2017 (Elizabeth C. Economy,
2018, pp. 30--31). Surveys suggest that the **[[anti-corruption
effort]{.mark} has become a [considerable source of personal legitimacy
for Xi]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Dickson, 2016, p. 91). Yet at the same
time, he has also used the pretext of anti-corruption measures to
centralize control of the party's disciplinary apparatus in the hands of
a close ally. Accordingly, what had begun as an anticorruption campaign
was increasingly turned into a convenient tool to target his political
opponents with even former Politburo members no longer safe (Minzner,
2018, pp. 106--107).

**[Therefore, [loyalty to China's "central leader" is]{.mark} once again
becoming the [primary determinant for the promotion of
officials]{.mark}]{.underline}**, already more than [**[half of the
Politburo]{.underline}**'**[s]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[and its
standing committee now consists of Xi's allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Elizabeth C Economy, 2018, p. 62). Thus, **[[loyalty to the "central
leader]{.mark}" is once again becoming [the primary determinant of
promotion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Magnus points out one-man 11 rule
will make China more vulnerable to economic disruption and could
undermine the very adaptability that has enabled the CCP's current level
of performance legitimacy (Magnus, 2018, p. 141). Although there is the
possibility that Xi Jinping might use his unconstrained power to push
through the necessary structural economic reforms that would allow China
to successfully transition to a high-income economy - such as an
overhaul of the inequitable education system or the downsizing of the
inefficient state sector - so far there appears to be little indication
of such a course of action (Düben, 2018, pp. 13--14).

#### Massive [alt causes]{.underline} to legitimacy---economy, public goods, social services, and the [hukou]{.underline} system.

5\. New **[[Modes of Legitimacy with Chinese
Characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark}**

5.1 Adapting Performance Legitimacy vs. Maintaining Middle-Class Support

In the introduction, I already alluded to the **[[possible existence of
alternative strands of legitimacy]{.mark} employed by the
CCP]{.underline}**. Indeed, already in 2010, Holbig and Gilley had found
empirical evidence for an '**[[unusually agile, responsive, and creative
party]{.mark} effort [to maintain its legitimacy]{.mark}" through a
combination of "[economic performance, nationalism, ideology, culture,
governance, and democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** as defined in terms of
popular sovereignty under the leadership of the party" (Holbig and
Gilley, 2010, p. 414). In the following, some of these alternatives to
performance legitimacy will be discussed in more detail.

Performance legitimacy may be becoming less viable in its current form,
but this does not necessarily mean that the CCP leadership must or even
should entirely abandon it as a source of legitimacy. Essentially, if
**[[economic performance]{.mark} becomes more [difficult to
attain]{.mark}]{.underline}** could not a **[[shift towards]{.mark}
providing better access to [public goods and services]{.mark} be able
[to sustain]{.mark} performance [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**?
Particularly in the Chinese case, this is an extremely pertinent
question, due to the de-facto existence of a two-class system in China's
urban areas.

Now, this requires some context: **[[China's economic rise]{.mark} was
in large parts [driven by its urbanization]{.mark} with almost 300
million rural migrants moving into its cities.]{.underline}** However,
these **[[migrants]{.mark} were not simply assimilated into the present
urban population]{.underline}** and instead **[continue to [face
considerable discrimination due to the Hukou]{.mark} household
registration system]{.underline}**. This system dates back to 1958 and
assigns Chinese citizens two registration statuses either "agricultural"
or "nonagricultural," with future generations inheriting the status of
their parents irrespective of their actual location or vocation. This is
problematic because the hukou system **[determines [access to education,
health-care, unemployment]{.mark} insurance, and low-rent public
housing, essentially barring rural-urban migrants from these
services]{.underline}** (Dreger and Zhang, 2017, pp. 7, 12).
Accordingly, this system does not just cement the massive socio-economic
imbalance between urban dwellers and rural migrants but passes it on to
future generations. Consequently, rural-urban migrants consistently
report considerably lower happiness than either rural or urban
population (United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network,
2018, p. 71).

Considering, that government action on this issue has the potential to
not only appease the 15 unhappiest segment of the population but also to
boost China's economic growth by facilitating the migration of labour to
where it can be most productive, Hukou reform would seem like the
obvious course of action (Monkman, 2015, pp. 84--86). Indeed, there has
been a broad consensus among scholars, journalists, and even the CCP
leadership that hukou reform if not outright abolition should be at the
top of the reform agenda. Nevertheless, despite the ambitious "National
Plan on Urbanization (2014-2020)" issued by the Central government that
seeks to provide 100 million new urban hukous by 2020, progress has been
slow. In part, this has been due to the fact that it is predominantly
the local and provincial governments rather than the central government
that set the requirements for granting a local hukou (Chen and Fan,
2016, pp. 10, 13--14). However, this alone cannot account for the slow
progress on what the CCP leadership considers to be one of their most
important policy objectives. Instead, the answer to this quandary
probably lies in the attitude of the urban middle class would take
towards a comprehensive overhaul or even the elimination of the Hukou
system. As one of the primary beneficiaries of economic growth, the
urban middle class generally displays high levels of regime support and
is wary about anything that might destabilize the current system -- and
their position in it (Dickson, 2016, pp. 229, 309--310; Miao, 2016, pp.
182-- 186). However, the hypothetical abolition of the hukou system
would represent a fundamental threat to their vested interest. Since, in
absence of an increase in funding providing an additional 300 million
people with the same level of access to public services as currently
enjoyed by the urban middle-class, the quality of these services must
necessarily decline.

Hence, **[hukou reforms must be carefully balanced with]{.underline}**
maintaining the support of China's **[middle class]{.underline}**,
explaining the nearglacial pace of reform in this area. Consequently,
migrants have not shown much interest in what little improvements have
been implemented. Although hukou conversion is now possible this remains
mostly limited to small and medium-sized cities and if migrants convert
their rural hukou this also means losing their land property rights
(Chen and Fan, 2016, pp. 9-- 10, 14--16). At least in case of the latter
issue, there is currently an effort underway to finally create a
"nationwide system of secure and transferable property right in
agricultural land." However, it is rather telling that the significance
of such a major reform is being deliberately played down by Chinese
policymakers. Yet, at the same time, there has also been a
central-government directed effort underway to expel migrants from
Beijing in order to reduce the strain on the city's infrastructure
(Buckley, 2017; Buckley, Wee and Wu, 2017; Naughton, 2018a, pp. 5-- 16
6, 10). Nevertheless, for **[[the CCP adapting its]{.mark}
performance-based [legitimacy strategy to the changing
circumstances]{.mark}]{.underline}** still constitutes the most
promising alternative or at least complement, to legitimacy derived from
economic performance

Turning towards nationalism in the longer term

[**[Economic growth]{.mark}** has been a [key pillar of the
CCP's legitimacy]{.mark} since Deng Xiaoping's time. [**Robust growth**
is **central** to party **legitimacy** for the
CCP]{.mark}]{.underline}---slowing growth erodes their hold on power. As
early as 2016, analysts warned about the [PRC's employment of
[nationalistic foreign policies]{.mark} to [protect the CCP's legitimacy
against the effects of its slowing **economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. CCP
rhetoric around the country's 'century of humiliation' in which its
territorial disputes with its neighbors and the issue of Taiwan are seen
as "wounds from this humiliating past" are prime examples of this
behavior. This is complemented by President Xi's slogan of the 'great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation', where the party is positioned as a
force to restore the PRC's rightful place in the world. Such a turn
towards nationalism was in full display in the late 2010s when the PRC
reacted to its perceptions of the increased international threat posed
to the country by pursuing wolf-warrior diplomacy, embracing a more
confrontational tone on the international stage. 

Although the PRC has toned down on its wolf-warrior diplomacy, its
statements on the reunification with Taiwan, which it sees as a renegade
province, continue to embrace antagonistic and nationalistic rhetoric.
Since 2022, the PRC has increased the frequency of military exercises
around the island. In his 2024 New Year's address, President Xi
declared that reunification was a "historical inevitability." Some have
warned that the PRC's elevated pressure on Taiwan indicates a higher
likelihood of a military confrontation to reunify the island. 

To be sure, there has been pushback against the notion that the CCP will
resort to conflict as a diversionary tactic from the country's economic
troubles. President Biden posited that the PRC's [[**economic troubles**
left President Xi with "his hands full]{.mark}."]{.underline} Other
experts argue that it is irrational for the CCP to engage its military
in a war that has an uncertain prospect of success, as this could cost
the party its vital support base. While there are merits to these
arguments, Indo-Pacific experts highlight that public opinion exerts a
great influence over the CCP. Based on this, [they expect the [drumming
up of nationalist sentiments]{.mark} to drive the party into adopting
more aggressive responses to regional crises, including the use of
military force]{.underline}. This is concerning. The CCP may be
compelled to act by forces that the party itself once deliberately
cultivated but now have escaped the CCP's control. This illustrates the
real risk that the PRC, along with the other powers involved, might
stumble into a war.

The growing [threat of the PRC's economic slowdown]{.underline}

The PRC's [**[slowing economy]{.mark}** has received the attention of
political analysts over the past year, yet ambiguity remains over what
this entails for its foreign policy. Its **slowing economy** can be
[linked to antagonistic foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline} actions
adopted to mitigate its impacts including dominating the markets of its
neighbors and abusing its monopoly to demand below-market prices,
straining regional relations. Beyond economics, [the PRC's [slowing
growth **threatens** the CCP's political **legitimacy**]{.mark} and has
[incentivized it to strengthen nationalist
sentiments]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} While the floundering economy
may restrain the party from escalating its rhetoric into full-scale
conflict, nationalism cultivated by the CCP may prove difficult to
control. [The PRC's leaders may find themselves compelled---by the very
nationalist forces it had unleashed---into conflict during periods of
high tensions]{.underline}. While the idea of a PRC in decline might
seem welcoming to the West, it might also herald a period of heightened
tensions and uncertainty. Given the possibility of hostile relations
triggered by the PRC's slowing economy, this is not a development that
should be overlooked or underestimated.

CHINESE NATIONALISM, TRUMP 2.0, AND IMPACT ON TAIWAN: IMPLICATION

[[Chinese nationalism under Xi]{.mark} Jinping could [lead to even more
hawkish policies on Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nationalism acts as
double-edged sword: while leaders can use nationalism to win domestic
support, nationalism skews perspectives on outsiders, causing
individuals to view adversaries as threatening and possessing harmful
motives. This can get out of hand and force leaders to promote more
hardline, aggressive responses as they wish to dominate others or think
that defending their nation necessitates the use of force.

Alternatively, the CCP may be induced to invoke preexisting nationalism
to consolidate control. According to [[**diversionary theory**,
leaders]{.mark} facing domestic pressures may [**generate**
**international conflicts**]{.mark} to divert public attention to
foreign troubles to stay in power.]{.underline} One [study found that
**[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping [relied on **diversionary foreign
policies**]{.mark} to **inoculate** himself during the time when serious
tensions between Xi Jinping and political elites
occurred]{.underline}.\[13\] Some analysts and officials also deemed
recent military drills by the PLA as part of Chinese internal
propaganda, with the goal of winning domestic support.

[While nationalist sentiment may drive Beijing to rely more on
**diversionary tactics**,]{.underline} under the current geopolitical
environment, [[Beijing has **little incentive** to start or **engage**
in **large-scale conflict**]{.mark} in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}.
The U.S. government under Donald Trump is quickly reshaping
international politics. Trump's preference for a unilateral,
transactional diplomatic approach may indicate more opportunities for
authoritarian regimes (as shown by Trump's plan for Gaza and attempt to
end the war in Ukraine) to expand their influence, but [[Beijing has
been expecting]{.mark} [the Trump administration to implement **tough
policies** on China]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[14\] What happened after
Trump took office justified Beijing's worries. On January 20, Trump
imposed a [10% duty on all Chinese imports]{.underline}, which prompted
Beijing to respond with countermeasures, and Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang Yi said on February 14 at the Munich Security Conference that China
will "'Play along to the end' if the United States is bent on
suppressing the country even though Beijing does not wish to be in
conflict.\[15\]"

As the outlook of U.S.-China relations remains unclear, [[Beijing is
likely to prioritize its relations with the]{.mark} U.S., while
[**maintain** its **current policy stance**]{.mark} when it comes to
[cross-Strait relations]{.mark}]{.underline}---intensifying pressure and
advancing so-called integrated development measures on Taiwan.
[[Diversionary tactics]{.mark} may [come in the forms of further
**gray-zone aggression**]{.mark} against Taiwan]{.underline}, which
still increases tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

Our **[assessment is based on a [range of behaviors and trends]{.mark}
across China, Taiwan, and the United States]{.underline}** (US), as
described in the Key Findings below, and in **[[consideration of China's
broader geopolitical context]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see Appendix A).
Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that --- **[[absent a
specific catalyst]{.underline}]{.mark}** that leads to war (such as if
**[[Taiwan were to declare formal independence]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
--- the **[Chinese Communist Party ([CCP) leadership]{.mark} is very
[likely to remain focused on improving domestic
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}** and strengthening preparations for
navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or
other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea).
**[In [the long term]{.mark}]{.underline}**, we assess that **[[China
will]{.mark} likely have [established a level of preparedness across the
military, economic,]{.mark} social, and other [domains by
2027]{.mark}]{.underline}** that would **[[enable its leadership to
invade Taiwan as a "war of choice]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (rather than
in response to a specific catalyst) while **[minimizing associated costs
and risks.]{.underline}**

Our assessment is **[[generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan
and US]{.mark} government and military officials since the start of
2023]{.underline}**, both of which emphasize active preparations
regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically,
Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite
the potential for a diversionary war to distract from China's domestic
economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the People's
Liberation Army's (PLA's) amphibious capability while recognizing the
PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan --- the foremost
alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not
imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that
**[[China's forces are on track to meet their modernization and
readiness goals]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy,
disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor
industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the
US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario
should consider taking steps such as building relationships with
potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase
of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to
identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining
encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating
high-value computer systems to limit an adversary's lateral movement in
case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence
capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional
recommendations can be found in the Preparing for Potential Global
Economic Disruption section of this report). Indicators of escalation to
support monitoring are provided in Appendix B. Given the public focus on
the impact of an invasion on Taiwan's semiconductor industry, Appendix C
further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially
relevant to judging if or when China might invade. Key Findings
Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the
short term include: China almost certainly continues to prefer "peaceful
reunification" and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track
strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.
China's economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the
focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation.
Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a
successful invasion of Taiwan, China's military continues to have
limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an
invasion. China's leadership has likely not begun telling the public to
prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the
CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public
opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to China's goals, polling
results since 2020 likely suggest to China's leadership that its
strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short
term. Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long
term include: The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely
expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan. Under Xi
Jinping's leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other
measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign
economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar,
and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical
minerals. China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical
infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a
potential conflict. China's leadership has intensified its use of
"lawfare" measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The
PLA, China's wider armed forces, and China's defense industry are
continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful
invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios. The
political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward
potentially permanent rejection of unification. China's leadership
almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward
overturning its (the US's) "one-China" policy, which is one of Beijing's
likely "red lines" that could hasten an invasion scenario.

Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term There are several
elements of China's behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan
invasion is unlikely before 2027. **[These [include China's almost
certain continuing preference for "peaceful
reunification]{.mark}]{.underline}**", indicators that it very likely
continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges
that very likely take priority given China's other ambitions, shortfalls
in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun
mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally,
public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to
China's leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter
independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that --- absent a
specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal
independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan)
--- the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain
focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations
for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other
conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).

Trends in China

**[[China almost certainly continues to prefer "peaceful
reunification]{.mark}" and very likely continues to invest in a
dual-track strategy]{.underline}** that **[[combines economic
inducements with coercive elements]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While the
**[coercive elements of the CCP's strategy --- including large-scale
military exercises]{.underline}** (reportedly with cyber components),
**[[a]{.mark}ir [d]{.mark}efense [i]{.mark}dentification
[z]{.mark}one]{.underline}** (ADIZ) **[[incursions]{.mark}, and
expanding law enforcement patrols around Taiwan's outlying
islands]{.underline}** --- receive the most attention, examples of the
other side of CCP strategy include the following: a June 2024 plan to
"**[[deepen cross-strait innovation and development
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in Dongguan city, January 2024
reforms in **[[Fujian that created new government offices for
Taiwan]{.mark} work]{.underline}**, and a September 2023 plan to build a
"cross-strait integrated development demonstration zone" in Fujian
province, and 68 other preferential policies and measures targeting
Taiwan businesses in China between 2018 and 2020. Xi Jinping's
activities in October 2024 also very likely signal this dual-track
approach, omitting references to "peace" in statements relevant to
Taiwan and visiting locations significant to China's civil war history
while also calling for greater integrated development. On January 15,
2025, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that
integrated development is a focal point for the coming year.
Additionally, there is almost certainly still no strict deadline for
achieving unification.

China's economy is in a period of transition, volatility, and struggle,
facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership
as it strives to attain national rejuvenation and continue preparing for
potential armed conflict. China's challenges include
a depressed property market, deflation, high local government
debt, declining foreign investment, elevated youth unemployment,
and lingering dependence on critical foreign technology like
semiconductor production tools (for more on the relevance of
semiconductors in China's likely Taiwan invasion calculus, see Appendix
C), while shifting toward "a green, high-tech" structure. These and
other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to
distract from domestic troubles (1, 2, 3, 4), but this is unlikely.
First, **[[diversionary war has not been the CCP's method
for managing domestic crises]{.mark} since 1949]{.underline}**. Second,
the **[[economic challenges are likely not great enough to derail the
PLA's ongoing modernization]{.mark} in ways that would limit China's
option to use force in the future]{.underline}**. During this period,
**[Xi [Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic
problems]{.mark} while [strengthening the military to support
conditions]{.mark} for achieving national rejuvenation by
2049]{.underline}** --- a goal with an economic component --- and to
prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed
necessary.

Despite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a
successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), China's
military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not
yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations
very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of
Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to restore air
operations following enemy assaults, difficulty integrating submarine
forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness
and operational capacity limitations. Corruption also continues to be
a major challenge for the PLA and China's defense industry, potentially
disrupting the military's organizational command, the quality of its
personnel, its preparedness for warfare, and the attainment of its
modernization goals.

**[China's [leadership has likely not begun telling the public to
prepare for war]{.mark} and [public support for a war is likely not at
levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an
invasion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This point is debated, with some
analysts focusing on Xi Jinping's warning that "the stormy seas of a
major test" are looming, his emphasis on "worst-case scenario thinking",
and the CCP's escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan. However, when asked
about this language during a US Congressional hearing in 2024, multiple
experts from the US, India, and elsewhere assessed that available
evidence likely does not point to warnings of an imminent invasion
specifically, but rather to the rising risks of China's volatile
economic and geopolitical context generally (see Appendix A). In
particular, these experts focus on the lack of state content
"demonizing" China's would-be opponents in Taiwan and likely the US.
Moreover, only about 50% --- at most --- of the Chinese public likely
supports a use of force to unify Taiwan under certain conditions;
**[[China's leadership would likely prefer a stronger base of popular
support]{.mark} before initiating a high-risk and potentially costly
invasion]{.underline}**, for reasons related to PLA reliance on civilian
systems and because failure could threaten at least the current CCP
leadership if not wider party legitimacy (1, 2, 3).

Trends in Taiwan and the US

Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan indicate the majority
of people are very unlikely to ever willingly support unification
(discussed later in this report), polling results since 2020 likely
suggest to **[[China's leadership that the military and other elements
of its strategy are working to curb preferences for independence]{.mark}
in the short term]{.underline}**. Since 2020, support for maintaining
the "status quo" has increased while moving "toward independence" has
trended downward (an uptick in June 2024 notwithstanding). Further,
support for maintaining the "status quo indefinitely" has risen since
2020 from 25.8% to 33.6%. **[[Support for \"independence as soon as
possible" has also fallen from 6.6% to 3.8%]{.mark} in this same
period]{.underline}**. These results likely decrease the likelihood of
an invasion given China's very likely preference for solving domestic
challenges and further preparing in case an invasion is deemed
necessary.

Insikt Group has not identified any trends in the US that would, in our
assessment, decrease the likelihood of invasion in the short term.

**[China invading Taiwan isn't a new topic, but [would China ever use
this war]{.mark} as a diversion or distraction]{.underline}**? This is
an unlikely scenario, but as long as Xi is in charge, we must consider
every possibility.

Despite challenges to China's political and economic system, **[with a

for a war.]{.underline}** In addition, capturing Taiwan wouldn't provide
China with a strategic advantage, and it **[would likely lead to [hefty
economic vulnerabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The odds of a "diversionary" war happening are never zero, though. In a
system like China, all it would take is a miscalculation on Xi Jinping's
part or some dark realizations setting in... Hey everybody. Peter Zeihan
here coming to you from Colorado. Now, last week, I released a video on
why none of us should be really surprised if the Chinese system falls
apart. We'll leave the link here for those of you have not seen it. But
the most common follow up question that I've received from viewers has
been wouldn't this justify in the Chinese mind a diversionary war or
distraction war to increase public support? I can't rule it out, but I
don't think that's going to go down for three reasons. Number one, this
is not a democracy. This is an autocracy where the CCP has control of
the public space is huge and their ability to shape public opinion is
massive. And in that sort of an environment, you don't get the same
relative effects and you also don't have the same in stability from
economic problems that you might have in a more pluralistic society. So
I don't want to say no, but the government's ability to shape public
opinion and to stir up nationalism is pretty robust. If anything, the
government sometimes has a bit of a problem containing the nationalism,
not not getting it going. So from a legitimacy point of view, I don't
think it's really necessary. Second, anyone in China who can read a map
and do math knows that if they launch a war for Taiwan, it will it will
not end well, not the war itself, but what happens to the next day.
China is dependent upon the international community for roughly three
quarters of their energy sources, and most of that comes from a
continent away. On top of that, China is in terms of absolute volumes,
the most dependent on imports and exports of any country in the world.
And they import the vast, vast, vast majority of the materials that
allow them to grow their own food. So if you have even a moderate effort
by a small number of countries to go after Chinese commerce in the
aftermath or because of a war, this country will be facing a industrial
collapse in just a matter of months and a famine that will kill half the
population in a couple of years. And I have no doubt that at least
several years ago that the Chinese leadership understood that. And so
they primarily used Taiwan as a rhetorical issue. And most of the
threats that we're seeing now are not necessarily coming from the
decision makers. Well, a third let's assume that the Chinese can capture
Taiwan in a matter of weeks with minimal damage. That doesn't really
give them anything. I mean, yes, it technically is a break in the first
island chain, but the Chinese are still dependent on the international
system to get everything that they need, and they're dependent on the
U.S. Navy to patrol the global oceans so that their commercial cargo can
come and go. In fact, this would actually put their potential sea lanes
by Taiwan in greater risk from the Japanese, who have a better, longer
range navy than anything that the Chinese have. And then there's talk of
the semiconductor industry that the Chinese would be able to scoop. But
the Chinese can't operate their own semiconductor industry. It's not
just run with foreign equipment and software. It's run by foreign
personnel. And the Taiwanese facilities are the most advanced in the
world. And honestly, the Chinese wouldn't know what to do with it. I
don't mean that as a slam to the Chinese. I don't think any country that
took them over would be able to operate them in anything less than a
decade timeframe for the Chinese would take a lot longer than that. So
it really doesn't check any boxes now saying that it wouldn't work,
saying that a diversionary war would be unwise and would achieve nothing
for the Chinese is not the same as me saying. I don't think it would
happen, but the rationale would be very, very different. So two things.
Number one, it could be a miscalculation, not in the traditional sense
that, you know, we don't think anyone will do anything but a
miscalculation by JI. Remember that JI has formed such a tight cult of
personality that no one's bringing him information. So he's literally
making information, making decisions in a box without any idea of the
information that flows in or the reality of the world around him in that
sort of decision making structure. Sure, he could pull the trigger, but
it wouldn't be because of any of the reasons that you would normally
expect. So whether it's economic, strategic, political or whatever,
whatever we would say, you know, this might force a country to pull the
trigger. None of that applies to Xi because it's all in his head. And
it's not something that we can really guess at because we don't know
what's shaping his decision making, because we know he's not being fed
the information he needs to run the country.

**[The [second reason is]{.mark} quite [darker.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
If you're like me and you believe that **[we're looking at the [end of
the Chinese system]{.mark} over [the next decade]{.mark} for
[demographic reasons]{.mark} alone. [Forget politics]{.mark}, forget
[energy]{.mark}, forget vulnerability, forget the debt, forget [trade
wars]{.mark}, forget everything else]{.underline}**. Then **[there's
something to be said for pulling the trigger.]{.underline}** Because if
the **[[Chinese system]{.mark} is [facing]{.mark} that same [industrial
collapse]{.mark} and that same [population
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}** for other reasons, and there's
**[[nothing]{.mark} that the [Chinese government can do to stop
that]{.mark}]{.underline}**, maybe **[[buy a little bit of]{.mark}
[time]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and that's it.

Then **[[pulling the trigger]{.mark}, choosing the time and the place of
a war, even if you think you're going to lose, even if]{.underline}**
you know it's going to **[result in the death of half of your
countrymen]{.underline}**, if it **[[allows you to command the
narrative]{.mark} of the future.]{.underline}** Well, that means that
**[the CCP for the [low, low price of half the country's
population]{.mark} might be able [to rule into the next era of Chinese
history.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

And if you're **[completely amoral about]{.underline}** it, you got to
admit that might be a **[[compelling reason to launch a
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** that you know what will **[destroy you for
dark]{.underline}**. Not saying that's happening, but we **[can't rule
it out at this point.]{.underline}**

### !---AT: CCP Collapse

#### No China state collapse---Xi is [adaptive]{.underline} and [reflexive]{.underline}, he reduced [corruption]{.underline} which [splintered]{.underline} the party, and [outlets]{.underline} exist.

Political Economy @ Johns Hopkins University, 8-16-2022, \"How Resilient
is the Chinese Communist Party?\", Journal of Democracy,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4206099\] yc

\[pp. 77\] **[The typical [formula for authoritarian survival is]{.mark}
a four-part mix of [repression, propaganda, patronage]{.mark}, and
rigged elections]{.underline}**. Since taking power in 1949, **[the
Chinese Communist Party ([CCP) has consistently practiced]{.mark} the
first three]{.underline}**---and during the era following the death of
Mao Zedong in 1976, it **[[honed another source of resilience]{.mark}:
[institutionalization]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Writing in the Journal of
Democracy in 2003, Andrew Nathan argued that the **[[greater stability
wrought by institutionalization had made the CCP resilient]{.mark} and
helped it to keep power even as China modernized and integrated itself
into the global economy]{.underline}**.1 Making the **[process of
leadership turnover orderly and predictable was an especially important
feature of institutionalization]{.underline}**; other dimensions
included professionalizing the bureaucracy and allowing greater
political participation within selected spaces.

Today, it **[appears to many that [Xi Jinping has ended]{.mark} all
this]{.underline}**. In 2012, he became paramount leader of the People's
Republic of China (PRC), in the midst of a high-profile corruption
scandal that laid bare the intensity of factional struggles among
political elites. In 2018, he overturned constitutional term limits and
is expected to make himself president of the PRC for a third term and
possibly for life in the upcoming Twentieth Party Congress in October
2022. Under his rule as general secretary, the **[[CCP has extended its
reach into economic and social policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, domains
that had previously been left to the executive branch led by the premier
and the State Council. **[The [limited leeway once given to political
participation]{.mark} in forms such as [investigative journalism has
been squeezed]{.mark} [down to almost nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A
personality cult now revolves around the leader, with "Xi Jinping
thought" enshrined in the constitution and taught to young children in
school.

\[pp. 78\] Has institutionalization really ended under Xi? And if so,
will the CCP regime remain a resilient autocracy? While Xi has
drastically weakened dimensions of institutionalization---particularly
limits on his own power---he has not eliminated it. **[The CCP [still
commands a high-capacity bureaucracy]{.mark} that the president and the
party can mobilize to execute its commands]{.underline}**, as seen
during the covid-19 outbreak. Moreover, despite his authoritarian
turn**[, Xi has not entirely abandoned the CCP's famously adaptive
methods of governance, including policy experiments]{.underline}**. When
**[Xi]{.underline}** **[runs into problems with no easy
solutions]{.underline}**---for instance, how to curb the excesses of
capitalism without crushing entrepreneurial incentives---he **[[still
exhorts the bureaucracy to adapt and experiment]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
At the same time, he is more repressive than his predecessors: He has
tightened ideological controls on society and the bureaucracy, punished
activists and critics, and stamped out pockets of freedom that existed
prior to 2012. In recent years, increasing U.S. animosity toward China
has given Xi even more ammunition to rally the CCP and the nation behind
him.

Just as the CCP's formula for authoritarian resilience has evolved, so
too have the risks it confronts. Under the power-sharing arrangements
marking the reform era from 1978 to 2012, **[elite [corruption enriched
factions]{.mark} and [threatened to splinter the CCP. Xi has made it his
mission to fight corruption]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But his
concentration of personal power has reintroduced the risk of succession
battles. Concentrated power also amplifies the effects of both good and
bad decisions made by the single leader who holds it. When Xi makes a
bad decision, the effects are seismic, felt not only within the PRC but
around the world.

Looking Beyond Formal Democratization

Institutionalization rarely features in mainstream literature on
authoritarian survival, except in the study of China and "soft
autocracies" in East Asia. Unlike other plainly corrupt and repressive
dictatorships, such as Iraq under Saddam Hussein or Zimbabwe under
Robert Mugabe, **[post[-Mao China is a high-performing authoritarian
state]{.mark} that for forty years running now has [delivered political
stability, economic growth, public services, and even policy
innovations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To understand why the CCP has been
able to deliver these results, one must look beyond formal
democratization---and at institutional reforms carried out at the
highest level of power and within the bureaucracy.

According to Nathan, the first dimension of institutionalization is
norm-bound succession: Each top leader serves two consecutive terms and
then hands over power to a successor. When Jiang Zemin stepped down as
CCP general secretary in 2002, "it was the first time that any leader of
a communist nation had left office without dying or being deposed by a
coup," Susan Shirk noted.2 Ten years later, when Hu Jintao retired as
CCP general secretary, PRC president, and Central Military Commission
\[pp. 79\] chairman and passed the baton to Xi, it appeared that the CCP
had institutionalized peaceful, predictable transitions of power.

Deng championed a second aspect of institutionalization---meritocracy---
promoting bureaucrats based on performance and thereby helping to limit
factionalism and patronage. Mao demanded fervent shows of loyalty to
himself as the means to political survival and rising in official ranks.
Deng, by contrast, insisted that bureaucrats should be rewarded for
solving problems. This shift toward merit is clearly reflected in the
goals assigned to bureaucrats in the post-Mao period: Economic growth
and social stability were at the top of the list. Students of the PRC
have produced a voluminous literature establishing the links between
promotion and performance in the bureaucracy.

Third, the **[[reformist leadership sought to professionalize the
bureaucracy]{.mark} by [separating the CCP from the direct
management]{.mark} of both the government and business
enterprises]{.underline}**. The aim was for decisions to be guided by
economic rationality rather than political ideology. Parallels can be
found in East Asian developmental states: Chalmers Johnson credited the
performance of Japan's post-WWII technocracy to its insulation from the
vicissitudes and short-term incentives of electoral politics.3 In the
1990s, China pursued a wide range of administrative reforms, including
the formal establishment of a civil service in 1993, followed by the
creation of a fleet of new regulatory agencies fit for a market economy.
**[These efforts steadily [built up the bureaucracy's professional and
monitoring capacities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Fourth, **[[although the CCP violently suppresses dissent]{.mark}, as
part of the reform push it selectively encouraged various "[input
institutions" that allowed citizens to express
complaints]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[seek redress on particular
issues---[so long as petitioners carefully avoided challenging the
regime as a whole]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Examples include empowering
citizens to overturn administrative decisions through the courts and
permitting newspapers to expose corruption and other social problems. In
1988, the CCP introduced village elections, not for the sake of
promoting Western-style democracy, but rather to defuse local conflicts
by allowing villagers to select their own leadership. According to
Nathan, these measures fostered high citizen trust in the CCP regime,
thus promoting authoritarian resilience.4

To be sure, all these "institutionalization" measures were **[[combined
with repression, censorship, and cooptation]{.mark} of influential and
restive groups]{.underline}**, as practiced in other dictatorships. But
[**[what]{.underline}**]{.mark} clearly \[pp. 80\] **[[distinguished
reform-era China was its delivery of political stability]{.mark} at the
highest level and responsive governance at the street level through
continuous institutional reforms]{.underline}**, many of which were
initiated by local governments. That is why more recent surveys
conducted by Bruce Dickson continue to find "a surprisingly high level
of regime support" despite "frustration about a variety of policy
issues."5

#### The bureaucracy is loyal to Xi---years of [indoctrination]{.underline} ensure [they]{.underline} won't turn on him.

**Ang '22** \[Yuen Yuen Ang, Alfred Chandler Chair Professor of
Political Economy @ Johns Hopkins University, 8-16-2022, \"How Resilient
is the Chinese Communist Party?\", Journal of Democracy,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4206099\] yc

**[[One must also distinguish]{.mark} between [institutionalization at
the peak of power and in the bureaucracy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
latter should not be dismissed as "non-critical," **[for it is the
[bureaucracy that implements the commands coming down from the
top]{.mark} and [determines whether or not the CCP can deliver results
and weather crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is worth noting that Xi
inherited a technocracy that Mao and Deng did not have. Contrary to the
trope that China has consistently had a highly educated Confucian
bureaucracy for thousands of years, Michel Oksenberg estimated that
local leaders in the 1960s had on average only 4.8 years of formal
schooling, due to a century of war, poverty, and Mao's anti-intellectual
policies.12

Over the four decades between Deng and Xi, the educational attainments
and professional training of Chinese officials steadily rose. From 2006
to 2017, the share of civil servants with a bachelor's degree or above
rose from 43 to 72 percent. In 2021, more than two-million people
applied for the PRC's civil-service examinations, and only 1.5 percent
were selected.13 Each year, hundreds of top students from elite Chinese
universities such as Tsinghua and Peking University are selected for a
\[pp. 82\] high-flyer program that sends recruits for training as local
cadres for one year, before they are fasttracked for promotion. Today,
some of the CCP's top officials boast degrees from leading Western
universities such as Harvard and the London School of Economics.

Despite Xi's authoritarian turn, **[the [professional capacities and
elaborate instruments]{.mark} of public administration [built up over
the past decades have not gone]{.mark} away. [Officials at all levels of
government are still evaluated yearly]{.mark} according to detailed
lists of expected accomplishments]{.underline}**. All 25 members of the
Politburo who were appointed or reappointed in 2017 had worked their way
up from the grassroots. Included was Xi himself, who was sent down to
the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution (Xi's father was a
purged CCP official), and then spent the initial years of his career as
a party functionary in a small village in central China

As Ezra Vogel pointed out decades ago, the **[[CCP has always wrestled
with the tension between stoking the fire of revolutionary spirit among
its officials and]{.mark} the need to regularize them for the sake of
effective [public administration and economic
development]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 14 Mao was obsessed with
revolutionary fire, while Deng championed competency. Xi has tried to
reinstate the CCP's grip on the bureaucracy so that following his
orders---and not a separate bureaucratic logic of economic rationality,
rules, and professionalism---will be the bureaucrats' top priority. To
this end, **[Xi [has imposed ideological control and his
personality]{.mark} cult not only on society in general but [on the
bureaucracy in particular]{.mark}]{.underline}**. His anticorruption
campaign is about more than stopping graft---it is also about ensuring
uniform political thought and loyalty to Xi's leadership. In 2019, the
**[[CCP's General Office issued new rules]{.mark} on evaluating
government officials, and the [first criterion is: "resolutely defend Xi
Jinping as the party's core]{.mark}... and its centralized leadership."
[Officials are required]{.mark}, using their real names, [to]{.mark}
[download a "Xi Jinping Thought" app]{.mark} from which [they earn
points by reading]{.mark}, commenting, and [taking
quizzes.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Put differently, **[[Xi has not destroyed the capacity of the
bureaucracy]{.mark}; rather, he has [deliberately weakened its
autonomy]{.mark}, so that [the bureaucracy will answer to him
personally]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And this is **[[not unique to
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the United States, **[President Donald
[Trump]{.mark} was criticized for politicizing the federal
bureaucracy]{.underline}** to advance his electoral interests. India's
former leader, **[Indira [Gandhi]{.mark}, undermined bureaucratic
professionalism by [meddling with appointments]{.mark} in the civil
service and courts]{.underline}**, in a bid to crush political
opponents. **[The difference in the [PRC]{.mark} is that absent checks
from civil society and formal contestation, [Xi's usurpation]{.mark} of
the bureaucracy for his personal ends [goes
uninhibited.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Mobilization and Adaptation

**[[Chinese leaders rely on the bureaucracy to implement their
vision]{.mark}, through mass mobilization, bottom-up adaptation, or
both. [Xi has turned]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[pp. 83\] **[[up the
mobilization dial]{.mark} while keeping elements of the adaptive
governance style that has underpinned China's post-Mao economic
dynamism.]{.underline}**

**[Mobilization means [galvanizing the entire administration]{.mark} and
society to reach a goal that the CCP sets]{.underline}**. This involves
a short but **[intense burst of efforts, featuring [coerced
participation]{.mark}, a [propaganda blitz]{.mark}, and [collective
displays of determination]{.mark} to achieve targets no matter
what]{.underline}**. These campaigns appear to achieve impressive
results fast, but typically at staggering human costs. The most tragic
instance is the Great Leap Forward (1958--62). Mao's plan to speed up
agricultural and industrial output to match levels in Britain and the
United States in just a few years ended with an estimated 36 million
people starving to death.15

Having asserted his personal authority and the party's, **[Xi has
repeatedly mobilized China's vast bureaucracy---it employs more than
forty-million functionaries--- to [serve his signature policies]{.mark},
from poverty eradication, anticorruption, and pandemic control to the
[B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative]{.underline}**.
Previous CCP leaders also pursued selected goals using mobilization
campaigns, but Xi pushes them to a fever pitch and sustains them longer.

#### No China state [instability]{.underline}---Xi's structurally [cracked down]{.underline} on reformism.

**[If [mobilization]{.mark} is [one enduring facet of CCP
governance]{.mark}, another [side features adaptation and
experimentation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Deng amplified the latter
through his philosophy of pragmatism and the governing system of
"directed improvisation," wherein Beijing set broad parameters while
local \[pp. 84\] governments innovatively devised local solutions to
local problems. Since the PRC opened up to markets, this adaptive style
of governance has spawned numerous "China models" of development within
China, with variations across regions and changes over time. Although Xi
has spurned Deng's pragmatism in favor of politicization and ideology,
elements of adaptive governance remain. Surprisingly, under
**[[Xi]{.mark}, [the PRC government]{.mark} has [issued more directives
containing language about experimentation]{.mark} than under any
previous leader, including Deng]{.underline}**.19

In particular, when no clear solution seems ready to hand, **[Xi turns
to adaptive governance]{.underline}**. In mid-2021, **[[under the banner
of "common prosperity]{.mark}," his administration launched a [sweeping
regulatory crackdown]{.mark} on tech and other private
companies]{.underline}**, wiping out an estimated \$1.5 trillion in
stock valuation and alarming investors everywhere. At year's end, a
chastened Xi gave bureaucrats contradictory instructions, telling them
that they must stamp out "unreasonable income" and "chaotic" capital
growth, while still encouraging entrepreneurship. Precisely because Xi
himself does not how to square this circle, he urged the bureaucracy to
adapt and experiment. Taking a page from **[Deng, he exhorted his
[audience of officials to "tailor your methods]{.mark} to local
conditions," and named coastal Zhejiang Province, where Xi was
previously the party chief, as his imperial pilot]{.underline}**.20

Tightening Control

It is well-known that Xi **[has [cracked down on political
freedoms]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Less known, however, were the limited
but real spaces for political participation and debate that existed
prior to Xi. **[[Back then]{.mark}, I [lectured openly on
"democracy]{.mark}" and "the rule of law" to Chinese university students
with no problem. No one gave me permission]{.underline}**---I **[simply
chose to talk about these topics and no one in authority cared to stop
me]{.underline}**. In the space left by official neglect lay room for
partial freedom of expression. In another instance, I became acquainted
with a public intellectual and veteran Communist Party member who often
spoke out against the CCP line. When censors confronted his employer
with demands to discipline him, that institution's response was to
broadcast videos praising his contributions. "China makes political
progress step by step," my acquaintance told me. He cited the case of
Sun Zhigang, a migrant worker who in 2003 was detained by the police in
Guangdong for lacking a residency permit and then fatally beaten while
in custody. Sun's death sparked public criticism that pressured
authorities to abolish the detention system. **["Individual incidents
can push societal changes," the public intellectual
added.]{.underline}**

Before Xi, **[transparency and public participation were gradually
expanding]{.underline}**. Some localities were experimenting with making
government officials' incomes and assets public information. In 2012,
central authorities considered making this policy the law of the land,
and state media backed the idea. The goal was not democratization, but
to promote \[pp. 85\] anticorruption and public trust. Yet the process
of trying out these initiatives had a democratizing effect. When one of
Zhejiang's township governments skipped public budget consultations one
year, members of the public, the media, and the provincial legislature
protested.21 Once given a taste of participation, Chinese citizens
wanted more.

With Xi's arrival in power near the end of 2012, however, **[these small
but precious steps toward liberalization were [abruptly
reversed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2013, **[the [Central Party Office
issued "Document Number 9" criticizing seven Western ideas]{.mark}---the
"Seven Don't Speaks"---[including press freedom]{.mark}, civil society,
and [civic rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**.22 **[Party officials [demanded
that universities inculcate students with "socialist values]{.mark}" and
warned against "Western forces hostile to China trying to infiltrate
China's ideological sphere."]{.underline}** There followed a crackdown
on media and the internet. **[[The CCP made an example of the reformist
editors]{.mark} and reporters at Southern Weekend]{.underline}**, a
Guangzhou-based paper known for its investigative journalism and bold
commentary. "All news media run by the party," Xi told journalists,
"must work for the party's will and its propositions, and protect the
party's authority and unity."23

In July 2015, **[authorities detained more than [three-hundred
human-rights lawyers]{.mark} and legal activists]{.underline}**. Several
detainees were **[[forced to confess their "crimes" on
television]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Prominent activists, including
anticorruption campaigner Xu Zhiyong, were arrested. The next year,
Beijing passed a restrictive law requiring all foreign NGOs to register
and be subject to scrutiny. Jurisdiction over them was transferred from
the Ministry of Civil Affairs to the Ministry of Public Security.

On top of that, **[[technology has helped the CCP expand its
surveillance blanket]{.mark} to a degree not previously
seen]{.underline}**. Even in the freest democracies, there are worries
that the **[[ubiquity of smartphones gives]{.mark} certain companies too
much [precise information]{.mark}]{.underline}** about every user's
life. **[[Such technology in China, when combined with cameras, facial
recognition, and individual databases]{.mark}, has created "[a sprawling
system of monitoring and intimidation]{.mark},"]{.underline}** Dimitar
Gueorguiev writes. "The data points of individual behavior add up in
large numbers and offer the regime a remarkably detailed picture from
which to exert control."24 **[In a tightly restrictive climate paired
with fine-grained surveillance, whether online or in person, [it appears
impossible for any group to organize in opposition against the
government.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### !---AT: Crime---No Impact

#### No [impact]{.underline} to rouge [states]{.underline}, [terror]{.underline}, or [crime]{.underline}.

**Mueller '21** \[John Mueller, 2021, "The Stupidity of War: American
foreign policy and the case for complacency," Cambridge University
Press, https://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/StWar\] yc

The two former members of the Obama administration also contend that
"any administration on whose watch an attack were to occur would
immediately face relentless political recrimination." However, it seems
likely that **[[politicians and bureaucrats]{.mark} are [overly fearful
about]{.mark} the consequences of reacting moderately to
[terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, their worries about job
security, budget preservation, and political consequence are
exaggerated. For example, President Barack Obama was so daring as to say
that the United States can "absorb" terrorist attacks and, as noted,
that such episodes do not present an "existential risk" to the
country.61 Such seemingly impolitic remarks have drawn considerable
attention among the press and politicians.62 Yet, they hardly seem to
have hurt Obama's effectiveness or approval ratings -- though they did
not alter opinion either, of course. More generally, it should be asked
which officials have been damaged by terrorist attacks, and when?
Certainly not George W. Bush -- when 9/11 occurred on his watch, his job
approval ratings went sky high and then declined only quite slowly
thereafter.63 **[Officials in the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates seem
to have [survived large attacks]{.mark} like the ones on F[ort
Hood]{.mark} in 2009, [San Bernardino]{.mark} in 2015, and
[Orlando]{.mark} in 2016, as have those abroad after attacks in [London,
Paris, Brussels, Barcelona, and Berlin]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Who has
been sacked?

For all the gloomy difficulties, there ought at least to be an effort to
try to communicate the risk terrorism presents in a responsible manner.
That is, risk assessment and communication should be part of the policy
discussion over terrorism, something that is a far smaller danger than
is popularly portrayed, or imagined. At a minimum, efforts should be
made to reduce the glory from terrorism by treating terrorists more like
common criminals -- although this would mean, as Sageman points out,
putting a stop to press conferences in which officials "hold
self-congratulatory celebrations of their newest victories in the 'war
on terror'." He stresses that to allow officials to "exploit the issue
of terrorism for political gain is counterproductive."64 In addition,
the persistent exaggeration of the mental and physical capacities of
terrorists, discussed in Chapter 4, has the perverse effect of
glorifying the terrorist enterprise in the minds of many of its
practitioners. But perhaps there is a considerable amount of
(self-interested) method in the madness. As Kenneth Anderson puts it
provocatively, "what government security measures, or ecosystem of
security measures, could survive scrutiny if it were accepted, and taken
as the central comparative fact, that the \[yearly\] chances of an
individual U.S. person dying from terrorism in the years 1970--2013 was
a mere 1 in 4 million?"65

**[The [main military efforts]{.mark} to deal with international
[terrorism have been]{.mark} the costly ventures in [Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Both of these were **[[much
disproportionate]{.mark} to the supposed danger
presented]{.underline}**, and they have been, in their own terms, and in
the long run, very considerable failures. In result, that kind of
military approach to terrorism, as suggested earlier, has been
substantially discredited, an issue that is discussed more fully in
Chapter 8 To the degree that terrorism requires a response, it is one
that calls not for large military operations, but for policing and
intelligence work and perhaps for occasional focused strikes conducted
from the air and by small ground units while relying on local forces to
furnish the bulk of the combat personnel. This is substantially the
approach the Obama administration developed to deal with ISIS as seen in
Chapter 5. It seems likely to prevail. In addition, efforts to deal with
the (questionable) dangers of atomic terrorism as discussed in Chapter
4, mainly require policing and intelligence, international cooperation
on locking up and cataloging fissile material, and sting operations to
disrupt illicit nuclear markets. They do not require large military
forces-in-being

Other problems Over the course of the last several decades, alarmists
have often focused on potential dangers presented by rogue states, as
they came to be called in the 1990s. These were led by such devils du
jour as Nasser, Sukarno, Castro, Gaddafi, Khomeini, Kim Il-sung, Saddam
Hussein, Milosˇevic´, and Ahmadinijad, all of whom have since faded into
history's dustbin.66 Today the alarm has been directed at Iran as
discussed in Chapter 6 and also at North Korea as discussed in this one.
However, neither country really threatens to commit major direct
military aggression. Iran, in fact, has eschewed the practice for
several centuries. Nonetheless, it might make some sense to maintain a
capacity to institute containment and deterrence efforts carried out in
formal or informal coalition with concerned neighboring countries -- and
there are quite a few of these in each case. However, the military
requirements for effective containment by their neighbors, by the United
States, and by the broader world community are far from monumental and
do not necessarily require the United States to maintain large
forces-in-being for the remote eventuality.

This is suggested by the experience with the **[Gulf War of [1991 when
military force]{.mark} was [successfully applied to deal with a rogue
venture]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- the conquest by Saddam Hussein's Iraq
of neighboring Kuwait. As noted earlier, Iraq's invasion was rare to the
point of being unique: it was the only case since World War II in which
one United Nations country has invaded another with the intention of
incorporating it into its own territory. It scarcely appears, as laid
out in Chapter 3, that Iraq's pathetic forces required a large force to
be thrown at them to decide to withdraw: over a period of half a year,
they did not erect anything resembling an effective defensive system
and, when the chips were down, they proved to lack not only defenses,
but strategy, tactics, leadership, and morale as well.

**[[Countries opposed to provocative rogue behavior]{.mark} do [not need
to have a large force-in-being]{.mark} because there would be [plenty of
time to build one up]{.mark}]{.underline}** (should it come to that)
**[[if other measures such as economic sanctions and diplomatic
forays]{.mark} (including appeasement) [fail]{.mark} to
persuade.]{.underline}**

In 2011, **[a White House report proclaimed that [transnational
organized crime]{.mark} poses a significant and growing threat to
national and international security]{.underline}**, with dire
implications for public safety, public health, democratic institutions,
and economic stability. However, as Peter Andreas points out in a study
of the issue, it is **[[not at all clear that international crime is
increasing]{.mark} as an overall percentage of global
commerce]{.underline}**. In fact, **[[trade liberalization has sharply
reduced incentives to engage in smuggling practices]{.mark} designed to
evade taxes and tariffs]{.underline}**, which were **[[historically a
driving force of illicit commerce]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More
importantly, he continues, the image of an octopus-like network of crime
syndicates that runs the underworld through its expansive tentacles is a
fiction invented by sensationalistic journalists, opportunistic
politicians, and Hollywood scriptwriters. In contrast, international
crime tends to be defined more by fragmentation and loose informal
networks than by concentration and hierarchical organization.67 Thus,
like a parasite, international crime works best when it keeps a low
profile and best of all when no one even notices it is there. Thus, by
its very nature it does not want to take over the international system
or threaten national security. It has no incentive to kill or dominate
its host.

In an age of globalization and expanding world trade, many, particularly
in the Navy, argue that a strong military force is needed to police what
is portentously labeled the global commons. However, **[there seems to
be no [credible consequential threat in that
arena]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Christopher Fettweis points out,
**["Today, the [free flow of goods is critica]{.mark}l to all economies,
and [no state would benefit from its interruption]{.mark}. \... [Free
trade]{.mark} at sea may no [longer need protection]{.mark} \... because
it [has no enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The sheriff may be patrolling
an essentially crime-free neighborhood."68 **[[Somali pirates hardly
present an occasional inconvenience]{.mark}, and, although there exist
choke points in international shipping, there are also exist routes
around them]{.underline}** in the unlikely event that they should become
clogged. And any armed cloggers are likely to be as punished and
inconvenienced as the clogged. Huge forces-in-being are scarcely
required because, in the unlikely event that the problem really becomes
sustained, newly formulated forces designed for the purpose could be
developed.69

Moreover, as discussed in Chapter 6, the "policing" navy seems to be
causing problems. Indeed, it is the "global commons" romanticism that
seems to have fueled some of China's outward ploys, especially in the
South China Sea. **[[China has to be worried]{.mark} that [American
police]{.mark} can not only keep trade lanes open, but [close them on
the whim of,]{.mark} for example, any [effervescent and erratic resident
of the White House]{.mark} who should happen to become commander in
chief.]{.underline}** It is also worth considering that the maintenance
of a huge and costly military force by the distant United States might
well fail to be a credible deterrent to localized assertive behavior by
China because it is likely to be aware that there is little enthusiasm
in the United States for sending large numbers of combatant troops
abroad to directly confront such limited and distant effronteries.

Again, the **[[few studies]{.mark} that have [quantitatively
approached]{.mark} this issue have focussed on gangs, typically in the
United States]{.underline}**. Gang scholars have **[compared [violent
crime rates in areas]{.mark} with and without [gang presence]{.mark} and
showed that communities with stronger gang presence]{.underline}** (that
is, communities with a higher number of gang members) report higher
rates of violence (e.g. Robinson et al., 2009; Huebner et al., 2016).
This relationship is **[[independent of other known correlates of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** (for example, neighbourhood
disadvantage, see Robinson et al., 2009). Moreover, the impact of gang
presence can extend outside the neighbourhood boundaries and affect
violence in surrounding neighbourhoods (Cohen & Tita, 1999; Huebner et
al., 2016). At the individual level, Papachristos et al. (2015) have
shown that, in Chicago, criminal proximity to a gang member increases
the likelihood of a non-affiliated offender being a victim of a gunshot
injury. We note, however, that all these conclusions are drawn from
studies conducted on (youth) gangs operating in a relatively small set
of cities in the United States, typically characterized by a wide gun
availability, 'endemic' levels of violence and high ethnic segregation.

Other works have found that **[organized crime presence can have the
[opposite effect of decreasing the level of
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some authors argue [that **[by settling
disputes and controlling the territories]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[where
they operate, [Mafia-type organizations manage to 'keep a lid on
things']{.mark} by offering an [alternative way of solving
conflicts]{.mark} that does [not require resorting to
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Campana & Varese, 2018; Aziani et al.,
2020a). Campana and Varese (2018) showed that **[Paul Massey, a
[gangster]{.mark} active [in]{.mark} the town of Salford, Greater
[Manchester]{.mark}]{.underline}** (United Kingdom), **[[was involved in
settling disputes]{.mark} and [providing protection for more than 30
years]{.mark}---and was [recognized by the community]{.mark} as
such]{.underline}** (Campana & Varese, 2018). Similarly, in a study of
London gangs, Densley (2014: 537) observed how ['**[some
gangs]{.underline}**]{.mark} in London \[...\] **[[protect community
residents from violence and exploitation']{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Systematic quantitative evidence of this phenomenon, however, remains
scarce.

Outside of the **[UK, [Italian Mafia groups]{.mark} are found to [limit
ordinary criminality]{.mark} such as thefts, robberies, and
assaults]{.underline}** (Aziani et al., 2020b) and expressive violent
crimes (battery and assaults) (Aziani et al., 2020a). This is **[also
the [case for groups outside the Global North]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
Magaloni et al. (2020) show that **[state interventions aiming to uproot
organized criminal groups with a governance function in [Rio]{.mark} de
Janeiro's [favelas]{.mark} have the unintended consequence of generating
an escalation in violence]{.underline}**. However, as empirical research
on organized crime groups' control over violence remains limited to
settings characterized by high levels of violence and/or a pervasive
organized crime presence, it remains unclear whether similar dynamics
apply to 'ordinary' settings.

Violence and the involvement of organized criminal groups in drug
markets

Several authors have argued that **[the presence of [illicit drug
markets]{.mark} can be an [important factor]{.mark} influencing the
level of violence in a local area]{.underline}** (Goldstein, 1985;
Reuter, 2009, 2016). Therefore, to fully grasp the crime-related
mechanisms underpinning violence at the community level, it is important
to consider the link between organized crime, violence and illicit drug
markets. According to Goldstein (1985), **[[drug markets can generate
violence]{.mark} in different ways, including from the interactions of
actors that are part of the system of drug distribution and
use]{.underline}** (systemic violence). Since transactions do not happen
in the context of a legal system, in which agreements and property
rights can be enforced, **[violence is generated [by competition among
sellers]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g. disputing over a territory or a
clientele) and by internal conflicts within a criminal group (e.g.
disputes about responsibilities or disciplinary violence) (Goldstein,
1985; Blumstein, 1995; Andreas & Wallman, 2009; Reuter, 2009). The level
of violence in a given drug market is also a function of the value of
the drugs: more valuable drugs (e.g. Class A drugs) tend to attract more
violence, as the stakes are higher (the economic returns of a violent
robbery are much higher) (Reuter, 2009; Coomber, 2015).

The relationship between the participation of organized crime or gang
members in drug markets and violence has been empirically analysed both
at the individual and the community level. At the individual level,
Bellair and McNulty (2009) find that gang members who engage in
drug-related activities report higher rates of violence compared to both
gang members who do not deal in drugs and non-gang drug sellers.
Moreover, residing in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods intensifies the
combined effect of gang membership and drug selling on violence. At the
community level, gang- and drug-related violence are found to be
spatially and temporally clustered (Cohen et al., 1998). Some authors
point to the role played by younger offenders carrying guns, who
contribute to drug-related violence as they more likely lack foresight
and thus may resort to violence to settle disputes (Blumstein, 1995;
Cohen et al., 1998; Reuter, 2009). However, once again, analyses were
mostly conducted in areas at high risk of violence in the United States
and among the youngest segment of the population.

The link between organized crime participation in illicit markets and
violence has been explored in the United Kingdom to a very limited
extent. **[[Qualitative ev]{.mark}idence]{.underline}** from a
nonmetropolitan area in Wales indicates that **[[membership in an
organized criminal group offers protection]{.mark} from drug market
violence]{.underline}** (Baika and Campana, 2020). **[According to an
experienced police officer]{.underline}** interviewed by Baika and
Campana (2020: 117), **[being a [member of an organized crime group
'makes obtaining the product]{.mark} \[Class A drugs[\] easier, cheaper
and safer]{.mark}, and their [own personal security is taken care
of.]{.mark} If you are a [lone wolf,]{.mark} you [don't have a support
network]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \[...\] **[If you have got the power of
an [organized crime group]{.mark} behind you, you have [got an
army]{.mark}, then you are in a more powerful position']{.underline}**.
The need for protection from security risks is more pressing for the
trading in Class A drugs compared to Class B or C drugs (Baika &
Campana, 2020). Niezink and Campana (2022) provide an empirical test for
this mechanism. Relying on police crime event data from Thames Valley
Police (South West England), they find that **[being a member of an
organized crime [group decreases the individual's]{.mark} risk [of
becoming a victim of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** but increases the
risk of violence perpetrated by fellow group members. They also find
evidence of retaliation and escalation among organized crime members and
non-affiliated offenders. However, their work only focuses on organized
crime-initiated violence. Qualitative evidence from other works (e.g.
Campana & Varese, 2018) has shown that **[organized crime [can solve
disputes among drug market players]{.mark}, thus [decreasing the overall
level of violence in drug markets.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

CURRENT STUDY

Previous studies show that organized crime can lead to higher violence
rates. This happens because criminal groups use violence to run their
illegal activities and control their territories, but also indirectly by
creating riskier environments that encourage violence by others.
However, an opposite effect has also been suggested. Another **[set of
studies has pointed out that [organized criminal groups may have]{.mark}
a [decreasing effect on rates of violence]{.mark} due to their ability
to control criminality in their territory and provide protection to
their members from the systemic risks associated, for instance, with
drug trafficking activities]{.underline}**.

#### Even if organized crime creates a [perception]{.underline} or [acceptance]{.underline} of violence, [empirics]{.underline} show a [stabilizing]{.underline} effect, even in [non-failed]{.underline} states.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper has offered a **[[rare quantitative exploration]{.mark} of
the impact of organized crime presence]{.underline}** on the level of
violence in local communities that are **[[characterized neither
by]{.mark} century-long [Mafia presence nor]{.mark} by fragile and [weak
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We examined the influence of
organized crime in an 'ordinary' place, often overlooked in research,
particularly in the Global North. Despite being common, these areas are
not free from violence or harm. Quite the contrary. Our study shows that
organized crime significantly contributes to violence in such places. In
this work, we leverage a large-scale dataset from Cambridgeshire
Constabulary including information on 219,245 crime incidents recorded
in Cambridgeshire between May 2018 and October 2021. A total of 145,090
individuals are linked to the incidents.

In addition, we found that the presence of organized crime in a local
community generates adverse consequences that go beyond their direct use
of violence, showing a clear impact also on the level of violence from
individuals that are not associated with organized crime. This is
consistent with the idea that **[organized crime groups can generate
local environments that are characterized by higher levels of
risk]{.underline}** and potentially a greater reliance on---and
**[acceptance of---violence]{.underline}**

\<\<TABLES OMITTED\>\>

Crucially, **[we also found evidence of the opposite effect of
[organized crime as a suppressor of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**: a
greater **[[prevalence of organized]{.mark} crime members in the overall
offenders' population is [associated with a decrease in]{.mark} the
overall [level of violence]{.mark} in a community]{.underline}**. More
specifically, **[an increase of [one percentage point in]{.mark} the
share of [organized crime]{.mark} offenders [is associated with a
decrease of approximately 5% in the violent crime
rate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This effect is essentially **[driven by the
impact of organized crime prevalence on the level of violence
perpetrated by non-organized crime members]{.underline}**. This suggests
that **[organized crime can have a broader [violence suppression
effect]{.mark} at the community level]{.underline}**. In other words,
organized crime per se is a driver of violence, but for a given level of
organized crime, communities with a higher proportion of offenders
affiliated to an organized crime group can expect lower levels of
violence. This is consistent with the **[idea of [organized crime
keeping 'a lid on things']{.mark} by [solving disputes]{.mark} [and
providing illegal private ordering]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Campana &
Varese, 2018; Gambetta, 1993; Reuter, 1983; Schelling, 1971; Varese,
2001 and 2011). Crucially, we **[see a [similar dynamic associated with
drug markets]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While we find that drug crimes
increase violence (over and above the effect of 'general' crime)---a
finding in line with Goldstein (1985) and Reuter (2009, 2016), among
others---we also find that **[a [greater proportion of organized crime
offenders participating in drug markets]{.mark} is [associated with a
decrease in the overall level of violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
offers further support to the idea that certain organized crime groups
can provide ordering and governance in illegal markets---as well as
protection (including self-protection) to market participants---hence
decreasing the overall level of violence (as anecdotally suggested, in
the case of the United Kingdom, by Campana and Varese, 2018 and Baika
and Campana, 2020, among others). These findings are all the more
interesting as the definition of organized crime adopted in this work is
rather broad (contrary to, e.g. the definition of organized crime put
forward by Schelling, 1971).

**[More generally, this work has shown that [organized crime]{.mark} may
have the dual effect of violence-enhancer and
[violence-suppressor]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is **[similar
to]{.underline}** how economic historian Frederic Lane (1958: 402, 416)
saw the **[role of governments as violence-using and
violence-controlling enterprises]{.underline}**. What is striking is
that such a dual effect of violence-enhancer and violence suppressor can
be traced also in non-traditional organized crime settings, suggesting
that the dangerousness of such organizations should not be
underestimated even in 'ordinary' settings. If left unchecked,
**[[organized crime groups]{.mark}]{.underline}** might seek to further
**[[capitalize on]{.mark} their [ability to]{.mark} provide illegal
ordering and [mediate conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** while controlling
local resources, thus accruing more power and prestige in illegal
markets and beyond.

[We [expect]{.mark} predominantly [**aspirational and rudimentary
interest** in CBRN attacks will continue in 2025]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Among foreign and domestic threat actors, we assess that DVEs and
criminals will remain the most likely perpetrators of deliberate
CBRN-related attacks. [**Ov**er the last year, there were 18 known
deliberate chemical- or biological-related incidents in the
Homeland,]{.underline} four of which were linked to political or
ideological motives while the rest were criminal in nature. All of the
incidents employed simple methods, and one incident caused at least one
death. Two of the 18 incidents involved the alleged use of ricin, while
14 of the incidents employed easily obtainable chemicals---including a
range of pesticides, chlorine, bear spray, and other chemical irritants.
Fentanyl was weaponized in two instances. [Foreign and domestic [threat
actors maintain aspirational interest]{.mark} in radiological and
nuclear attacks, [but these attacks remain
unlikely.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We expect threat actors will continue to explore emerging and advanced
technologies to aid their efforts in developing and carrying out
chemical and biological attacks. Over the last year, foreign and
domestic extremists online expressed interest in using DNA modification
to develop biological weapons to target specific groups. [We [remain
concerned about the potential exploitation of advances in]{.mark}
artificial intelligence [(AI) and machine learning to proliferate
knowledge that supports the development of novel]{.mark} chemical or
biological [agents.]{.mark}]{.underline} (For more information on AI and
threat actors, see pages 26--27.) Such advances could be exploited by
state and state-sponsored adversaries, [but **[the necessary expertise

actors.]{.mark}**]{.underline} We also remain concerned about the
potential for threat actors to use unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in

#### Terrorists [lack]{.underline} the technical knowledge to create bioweapons

A January 2025 article published by the American Council on Science and
Health detailed the [[results of]{.mark} a recent red-team
[activity]{.mark} (simulated security exercise) [where a professor and
two graduate students were able to]{.mark} manipulate their way through
safety regulations and [recreate the deadly 1918 Spanish flu
virus]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The conclusion of the scenario is that terrorists could easily do the
same, and that the American security apparatus needs to take action to
prevent a possible wave of bioterrorism before it is too late. But given
the knowledge starting point of the scientists, and ease of more proven
violent methods, is this a really legitimate concern?

[The simulated [test was overseen by the]{.mark} Federal Bureau of
Investigation ([FBI),]{.mark} and [saw the players involved, two]{.mark}
Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([MIT) graduate students,
successfully place orders for DNA fragments of the
virus]{.mark}]{.underline} from 36 of 38 providers, despite obvious red
flags, like the organization not being one that does lab experiments or
the address for delivery not being a laboratory facility. According to
MIT Professor Kevin Esvelt, who oversaw the students, they then were
able to employ "standard biochemical techniques" to create the deadly
virus.

That these graduate students were able to successfully complete such a
purchase 36 out of 38 times is alarming[, but consider how these MIT
students compare to an aspiring terrorist; is there perhaps a knowledge
and capability gap? [MIT is among the top-ranked schools in the world
and,]{.mark} according to EduRank, [number 1 in biomedical engineering.
**Hardly a representation of the average knowledge base**.]{.mark} Even
[knowing how to go about purchasing viral DNA fragments is highly
specialized knowledge]{.mark}, [let alone having the expertise to
successfully engineer those fragments]{.mark} to a level needed
[for]{.mark} [weaponization.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to research out of the University of Maryland's National
Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism
(START), [chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear ([CBRN) attacks are
seldom in the wheelhouse of terrorist groups.]{.mark} In fact, the use
of [weapons in this category]{.mark} has been [in an]{.mark} overall
**[downward]{.mark} [trend since 2000]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Terrorists
"generally lack significant chemical or biological skills or
experience."

#### History proves terrorists don't want to use bioweapons

Here is a deceptively simple question. [[Suppose that it were to become
technologically feasible for]{.mark} sophisticated groups of
[bioterrorists to cause extinction-level biothreats. Who would do such a
thing?]{.mark}]{.underline}

It may seem obvious that there are plenty of sophisticated bioterrorists
clamoring for the chance to eradicate humanity. But in fact, [[history
holds few]{.mark} if any [examples]{.mark} of sophisticated
bioterrorists bent on destroying humanity.]{.underline}

We saw in Part 2 of the series on epistemics that when pressed to
produce an example of a group of sophisticated, omnicidal bioterrorists,
effective altruists almost inevitably appeal to Aum Shinrikyo. For
example, here is Toby Ord in The Precipice:

People with the motivation to wreak global destruction are mercifully
rare. But they exist. Perhaps the best example is the [[Aum Shinrikyo
cult]{.mark} in Japan]{.underline}, active between 1984 and 1995, which
[[sought to bring about the destruction of
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}. They attracted several thousand members,
including people with advanced skills in chemistry and biology. And they
demonstrated that it was not mere misanthropic ideation. [They [launched
multiple lethal attacks]{.mark} using VX gas and sarin gas, killing 22
people and injuring thousands. They [attempted to weaponise anthrax, but
did not succeed.]{.mark}]{.underline} What happens when the circle of
people able to create a global pandemic becomes wide enough to include
members of such a group? Or members of a terrorist organisation or rogue
state that could try to build an omnicidal weapon for the purposes of
extortion or deterrence?

Only, we saw that this is simply not true. [[Aum Shinrikyo was **not
omnicidal.** Aum Shinrikyo aimed to produce an event that they
themselves would survive.]{.mark} From there, they aimed to rebuild
Japan and later the entire world.]{.underline} They prepared in detail
for this eventuality, including tasking their qualified medical staff
with drawing plans for survival, as well as outlining a strategy for the
creation of \`lotus villages' that would survive an attack.

Could history hold another example of sophisticated bioterrorists with
omnicidal intentions? Experts are skeptical. Kathleen Vogel and Sonia
Ben Ouagrham-Gormley explain in a study of emerging biosecurity threats
that:

Since the 1980s, there have been a variety of actors "crying wolf" about
how states and terrorists will adopt and use genetic engineering
techniques for harm. Yet [[we have **little empirical data** over the
past 30 years that show a]{.mark} specific state or [terrorist group
using any]{.mark} of these new [biotech]{.mark}nological [innovations to
create biological weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline}

That skepticism is echoed elsewhere. A former bioweapons inspector and
diplomat interviewed for BioSocieties explains:

You've got to start thinking about for whom this would be a valid weapon
of choice. I think for the [small-scale attack it would still be of
interest to terrorists because it would be a small-scale attack with big
impact.]{.underline} But [if you start talking about the stuff that can
cause huge damage -- live, highly transmissible, highly pathogenic
organisms -- [there's **very few actors**]{.mark} I can think of [who
would want to use that.]{.mark} I think you have to come up with
hypothetical actors rather than real-world actors.]{.underline}

Importantly, this expert does not deny the likelihood of actors being
motivated to carry out small-scale attacks. But he is highly skeptical
that many actors would want to destroy all of humanity.

Insofar as effective altruists struggle to produce a single, credible
historical example of a sophisticated omnicidal bioterrorist group, and
insofar as experts describe such actors as "hypothetical actors rather
than real-world actors", there are serious questions to be raised about
the assumption that sophisticated actors in this century will be
motivated to use biological weapons to bring about an existential
catastrophe.

## Climate

### I/L---AT: China Solves Climate

#### China Soft Power in the Arctic worsens climate change.

**Respinti 24** (Marco Respinti \[Italian professional journalist,
member of the International Federation of Journalists\], China's "Polar
Silk Road." 2. A Threat to Freedom, Ecology, and Human Rights,

Whatever one thinks of the theories of human origin of the climate
change, and the consequent need to reduce human productive activities to
counter it, countries in the world have committed to nationally
determined contributions (NDCs) to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions
as part of climate change mitigation.

The PRC's NDC is not very ambitious, and the country is likely to meet
or exceed it, which would allow the party-state to use the results for
propaganda purposes both at home and abroad. **[[Beijing]{.mark} is [not
likely to commit]{.mark} itself [to]{.mark} more serious [emissions
reductions targets]{.mark} in the future. Such a commitment would in
fact cause a high risk of losing face in case of failing to reach the
target.]{.underline}**

**[China's [NDC]{.mark} is [insufficient]{.mark} in [to]{.mark} reach
the goal of [limit]{.mark}ing the [global temp]{.mark}erature [rise to
2°C]{.mark} that was decided at the Paris Climate
Accords,]{.underline}** the international treaty that was signed in 2016
and is commonly known as "The Paris Agreement." Simply put, **[unless
other states do not implement much more ambitious emissions reductions
measures, the [PRC's poor record on the topic will frustrate and
jeopardize the whole attempt.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

\<\<Image Omitted\>\>

In particular, Beijing has not indicated how much its emissions will
grow before they peak. **[[In 2015]{.mark}, a number of Arctic Council
[observer states submitted]{.mark}, on a voluntary basis, their national
[reports on]{.mark} enhanced [black carbon and methane emissions]{.mark}
reductions, [including]{.mark} France, [Japan]{.mark}, Poland, Spain,
Korea, [India]{.mark}, Italy, and the European Union ([EU]{.mark}). [But
not the PRC.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Beijing's role as]{.mark} an [emitter of g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse
[g]{.mark}ases, [including short-lived climate forcers, is part
of]{.mark} the country's [broader environmental footprint in]{.mark} the
[Arctic. Chinese actors]{.mark} may [affect]{.mark} [Arctic
habitats]{.mark} more [directly]{.mark} through the investments of
Chinese companies in places such as Greenland, northern Canada, or
Siberia. Chinese [demand for resources is]{.mark} the [key]{.mark}
[contributor to]{.mark} the [extractive industries investment potential
in the Arctic]{.mark}. For instance, in 2013, the PRC imported more than
60% of the international iron ore trade. The country accounted for 44%
of global nickel demand in 2011.]{.underline}** Beijing is a major and
growing market for pulp derived from boreal forests. Moreover,
**[[Chinese shipping activities have marine and air environmental
impacts in the Arctic]{.mark}, [which are bound to increase]{.mark} with
growing traffic.]{.underline}**

In other words, the **[[PRC]{.mark} largely [contributes to]{.mark} the
[environmental problems of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}, most
conspicuously [through]{.mark} the impacts of [climate change]{.mark},
[but also]{.mark} through other [pollutants]{.mark} that end up in the
Arctic.]{.underline}** Moreover, the **[[country does not participate
in]{.mark} the [Arctic Council Working Group]{.mark} on black carbon and
methane]{.underline}**, which could present an important contribution to
addressing the impacts of climate change (again, whatever one may think
of it) in the North. **[Part of the black carbon that is deposited there
has its origins in China. [Beijing is in sum part of the problem, not of
the solution.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

AP News 2023: BEIJING (AP) --- [[China is touting its 10-year-old Belt
and Road Initiative as an alternative model for economic development,
releasing a government report that praises the program]{.mark} while
glossing over criticism that it has saddled poor countries with too much
debt. [The program championed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping has financed

carried out mostly by Chinese construction companies, financed by loans
from Chinese development banks]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its official goal
is to boost trade and investment by improving China's transport links
with the rest of the world. Analysts credit the program with directing

stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. "On some level, China has
added a World Bank to the developing world, and that is no small feat
and very appreciated by developing countries," said Kevin Gallagher, the
center's director. But the same study noted that many recipients of
Chinese loans are now struggling with their overall debts. Also,
Chinese-funded power plants are emitting about 245 million tons of
carbon dioxide a year, adding to emissions of climate altering
greenhouse gases. The Chinese government report highlighted railway
projects including a 590-kilometer (370-mile) route from Nairobi to the
port of Mombasa in Kenya and the opening of a 1,035-kilometer (643-mile)
railway in 2021 from the city of Kunming in southwestern China to the
capital of Laos. China filled a gap as the World Bank and other lenders
pulled back from infrastructure projects because criticism of their
impact on the environment and displaced local communities, Gallagher
said. But China in turn has come under similar criticism and is now
shifting its initiative toward a new focus that includes smaller
projects and renewable energy. "We do not have these massive
multimillion dollar infrastructure projects anymore, but rather smaller
projects, the official term is 'small and beautiful,' " said Christoph
Nedopil, the director of the Asia Institute at Griffith University in
Australia. They include solar and wind farms, factories to make electric
vehicle parts and batteries and mines for lithium and other minerals
needed for electric vehicles, Nedopil said. China's development lending
has slumped in recent years, in part because China has learned from the
debt crises in multiple countries and also because it has less money to
lend as its own economy slows down. Cong Liang, a senior official of
China's main planning agency, said during the release of the BRI report
that the country would adhere to "the principle of sustainable debt" and
work with indebted countries toward "a sustainable and risk-controllable
investment and financing system." The Belt and Road Initiative is part
of China's efforts to raise its international stature and push back
against U.S. criticism of Communist Party rule and Beijing's human
rights record. China's leaders accuse the U.S. of trying to impose their
principles on everyone else --- including China. They say their system
offers a different approach that accepts other countries as they are. In
contrast, a delegation of U.S. senators in China this week said they
stressed to Chinese officials that they would promote "freedom and
democratic principles and vigorously defend our values." The BRI report
says the program transcends differences in ideologies and social
systems, offering an alternative to the current path of globalization
that Beijing says has just widened the gap between rich and poor
countries. "It is no longer acceptable that only a few countries
dominate world economic development, control economic rules, and enjoy
development fruits," the report said. Next week, China is expected to
host a forum showcasing the BRI program.

The Silk Road Economic Belt was officially proposed during President Xi
Jinping\'s visit to Kazakhstan in September 2013.The following month, in
Indonesia, Xi proposed the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Together,
these two proposals are known as the Belt and Road Initiative. [[The
initiative came at a time when the serious negative impacts of the 2008
global financial crisis were still being felt by developed as well as
developing economies.]{.underline}]{.mark} It emerged at a time when the
powerful imperialist states were seeking to solve their problems at the
expense of the poor and weaker Global South countries. This was
manifested in growing protectionism, in which goods from developing
countries became uncompetitive in the world market due to the massive
subsidies that the large Western countries were giving to their
companies, both in industry and agriculture. This policy caused an
explosion of poverty in the world. [[Basing its endeavors on its
experience of opening-up at the end of the 1970s, China sought solutions
that would not negatively affect the poor and
powerless]{.underline}]{.mark}. This led China to promote a new type of
international relations based on the win-win approach of mutual benefits
and mutual security. It is an approach that sees the world as one, where
cooperation is the most important condition for advancement. [[That is
why, when China\'s economic strength began to grow after the country
launched its reform and opening-up policy, it started to help the
poorest countries in the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. It extended a
helping hand to those countries that could not obtain assistance from
the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund because of the
weakness of their respective economies --- those countries considered by
the West to be too high a risk for their investments. That type of
Western thinking was based solely on money. In fact, any assistance was
usually premised on those countries giving up control of their economies
to huge transnational corporations. In almost all the cases, investments
only went toward the exploitation of natural resources. The leading
Western powers used international financial institutions to impose
economic policies that emasculated the borrowing countries\'
sovereignty[. [China\'s cooperation with the developing countries has
been qualitatively different. It never dictates to countries what they
should do]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, it has worked with governments,
which have identified their own priorities. It has never tried to
subjugate any state for its sole benefit. [[That is why much of the
assistance given by China has been aimed at creating the conditions for
sustained growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its investment projects have
mainly been physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways and
ports as well as energy infrastructure such as hydroelectric plants. All
these projects are intended to stimulate and facilitate economic growth.
[[A lot of assistance has gone toward building up social infrastructure,
which has had a positive impact on the development of human capital and
promoted sustainable growth.]{.underline}]{.mark} China has not only
helped to build schools, hospitals and world-class sporting and cultural
facilities, but has also provided tens of thousands of scholarships to
students from developing countries. All of this has been done without
imposing conditions that affected any country\'s independence. This
win-win diplomacy has paid great dividends for China and the other
countries involved. Today, 152 countries have joined the Belt and Road
Initiative. It is this new type of relations that has allowed China to
become the largest trading partner of most of the countries in the
world. However, not everyone is happy with China\'s high and growing
prestige throughout the world, particularly the United States. Such
countries\' basic concern is that China\'s assistance is lessening the
dependence of developing countries, many of which are endowed with
natural resources, on the West. They are afraid of losing their power to
dictate to former colonies and semi-colonies and to use them as a source
of raw materials for the West. The imperialist states have therefore set
themselves two tasks. One is slowing China\'s economic progress. The
idea here is to make many of the big projects too expensive for China to
finance, and the second is using all means to discourage developing
countries from building and strengthening relations with China. They
have employed a wide array of measures to attain these objectives,
including a campaign of slander, economic sanctions, threats and
provocations. In their effort to discredit China\'s assistance, they
have spun incredulous stories. One of the most persistent is that China
wants to create a \"debt trap\" for poor countries in order to control
them politically. They use this approach, because that is precisely what
they have been doing since the end of World War II. On the economic
front, they are using sanctions against China and other developing
countries. In the case of China, they are using frivolous excuses to put
obstacles in the way of Chinese companies that are operating abroad,
accusing them of spying and other wild charges, none of which they ever
back up with evidence. On China itself, they are trying to prevent it
from obtaining high-tech equipment and tools that these countries
export. In this regard, they have banned the export of some microchips
to China. They have also forced other countries to do the same. When
China reacts by controlling some of its high-tech exports to the West,
we hear a hue and cry complaining of China being unfair. All their
measures are forcing China to become tech self-reliant. Despite these
concerted hostile measures, the Belt and Road Initiative has become
widely accepted. All the countries, developed and developing, that are
participating in it are experiencing positive results. The connectivity
by road, rail and sea has stimulated individual and regional economies,
as well as the international economy. Another reason that the US is
failing in its effort to roll back the Belt and Road has to do with the
economic situation in many Western countries. Many countries in the
European Union are experiencing recessions or are close to being in that
state. In the US, many people are becoming worried by the fact that the
dollar is losing ground in international commerce. The use of the dollar
as a weapon to sanction the world has led to more countries turning
their backs on the dollar and using their own currencies. Over the past
10 years, the Belt and Road Initiative has contributed greatly to many
of the positive changes in the world. Apart from the obvious and
demonstrable progress that has been achieved by all countries and
regions involved in the Belt and Road, we see some tangible spinoffs
from this bold and innovative plan. The projects are forging closer
people-to-people ties throughout the world, which has helped to promote
friendship and solidarity among peoples from various countries and
continents. No doubt this will lead to greater international solidarity.

#### Chinese soft power projects like the BRI rid the world with debt\-\--it's not key for the economy.

**[China's Belt and Road Initiative ([BRI]{.mark}) may be the [most
talked-about]{.mark} development [plan]{.mark} of the
century]{.underline}**. Xi Jinping's signature plan has captured the
world's attention since its announcement in 2013, with comparisons drawn
to the ancient Silk Road and the Marshall Plan. But recently, worldwide
coverage of the **[[BRI]{.mark} has grown [less favorable]{.mark} and
more critical.]{.underline}** Has **[[BRI]{.mark} [lost]{.mark} its
[luster]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The BRI now includes around 3,000 projects, according to official
Chinese sources. The majority of the **[[BRI]{.mark} projects involve
constructing infrastructure [to facilitate trade]{.mark}, which requires
collaborating [with]{.mark} partner [countries]{.mark} to secure lending
agreements and territory rights.]{.underline}** BRI's flagship project
and biggest success is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a
road and cable link between Pakistan's Gwadar port to Xinjiang, China.
China's BRI relies on projects financed by Chinese policy and commercial
banks rather than FDI, **[which [requires]{.mark} massive
[capital]{.mark} flow to partner countries in the form of Chinese
loans]{.underline}**. This model makes sense when considering China's
industrial overcapacity dilemma; **[[facing]{.mark} economic
[setbacks]{.mark},]{.underline}** China has already begun consolidating
manufacturing companies to prevent defaults on loans. China sees foreign
projects as an easy way for its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to secure
contracts and minimize losses.

However, **[these massive lending projects have [led to]{.mark} partner
[countries]{.mark} accruing [extreme debt.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This
problem was brought to the forefront of China's second Belt and Road
Forum in April. Several previous delegations refused to attend this
year, protesting growing concerns that **[[China]{.mark} both has
unethical standards and [leverages debts]{.mark} as a diplomatic
bargaining chip in its BRI strategy.]{.underline}** Notably, Turkey also
cited concerns for China's blatant oppression, through heavy policing
and internment camps, of Uighurs living along BRI pathways. Malaysia's
prime minister, during renegotiations of nearly \$23 bqillion in
rail/pipeline deals, called BRI agreements "unequal treaties" and "a new
version of colonialism" before cancelling the deals altogether. Other
**[[countries]{.mark} have already [paid the
price]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Sri Lanka's inability]{.mark} to
[resolve]{.mark} an [\$8 billion loan]{.mark} for its Hambantota Port in
2017]{.underline}** led to a debt-for-equity swap accompanied by a
99-year lease for managing the port. Even Pakistan's CPEC venture has
necessitated a \$6 billion bailout from the IMF. Debt distress is a
common trend with BRI projects, and although asset seizure is rare, this
trend raises valid concerns about the sustainability and methods of BRI
projects.

It remains unclear the degree to which BRI, a Chinese-led bilateral
initiative that employs some multilateral mechanisms to achieve
financing goals, will be guided by multilateral standards on debt
sustainability. A key factor in creating and maintaining successful
deals lies in the stability of partner countries. BRI's partners tend to
welcome China's "no strings attached" style of investment compared to
lending by Western powers conditioned on environmental concerns, human
rights, and other obligations. Although China's system is appealing for
many developing countries, it has **[[enabled corruption]{.mark} while
allowing governments to [burden]{.mark} their [countries with unpayable
debts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The reality is that, apart from pushing
its political agenda, the West's requirements were attached in order to
lower the risk of failure. The BRI's lack of requirements signals either
an absence of educated, informed planning or a deliberate decision to
**[[create]{.mark} [debt stress]{.mark} in BRI's
partners.]{.underline}**

The instinct may be to accept the latter conclusion, believing criticism
that **[the [BRI's]{.mark} underlying [motive is]{.mark} to
[expand]{.mark} [China's]{.mark} geopolitical [influence]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} a veil of [economic]{.mark} [dev]{.mark}elopment.
[But]{.mark} the former]{.underline}** seems just as plausible. For all
of its hype, no one, not even China, seems to know exactly what the BRI
is. Aside from vague policy objectives, there are no concrete policies
that define the BRI. This lack of vision and cohesion has **[[already
led to]{.mark} widespread [inefficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Studies
have demonstrated that BRI projects do not align with the BRI's proposed
"geographic corridors." This incoherence, combined with **[looming
[industrial overcapacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, paints a credible
picture that the BRI is demand-driven and opportunistic rather than
supply-driven and centrally planned. Additionally, the vague nature of
the BRI allows its brand to be extended to almost anything, from fashion
shows to dentistry to projects that lack any Chinese involvement, all of
which damage the credibility of BRI. Distrust of the BRI brand, in turn,
**[[stifles]{.mark} private [investment]{.mark}
domestically]{.underline}** (only 12% of FDI goes to BRI countries) and
abroad (former UK PM David Cameron's UK-China fund is struggling to
secure investors), which ensures that the BRI continues to rely on
precarious sovereign lending projects.

This is not to say that the BRI is a failure. Many BRI projects have
opened up conduits to new economic opportunities, particularly in
Central Asia. In response to criticism, China has recently taken steps
to reform the BRI, with changes to debt risk policy and transparency
(dubbed BRI 2.0 by Christine Lagarde). Here, BRI's ambiguity may prove
beneficial, as the initiative is so amorphous that recalibrations can
easily be integrated without admitting failure or defeat. But if the BRI
is to truly live up to its nickname as the "plan of the century**[,"
[Beijing needs]{.mark} to get [serious]{.mark} about [repairing]{.mark}
the potholes in its Belt and Road.]{.underline}**

[[less **authoritarian** Arctic]{.mark} communities [worry]{.mark} that
[China's]{.mark} Arctic [endeavors]{.mark} will slowly [undermine
**democracy**]{.mark}, **[open debate]{.mark}**,
**[accountability]{.mark}** and **[transparency]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

We are all [familiar with the trend]{.underline}. I think, for instance,
of the governor of Alaska, Bill Walker, who, in April last year, eagerly
shook hands with China's president Xi Jinping. The president was on a
refueling stop on his way home from a visit to the U.S. Some months
later in Beijing, Bill Walker signed deals that involved China's oil
giant, Sinopec, China Investment Corp. and the Bank of China in a
multibillion dollar project to bring natural gas from Alaska to Asia; a
project that U.S. investors had reportedly walked away from. I would
trust Gov. Walker's ability to write a fine speech on the disregard for
human rights in China with his left hand in less than 12 minutes, and to
deliver it at any high school in Anchorage or Fairbanks with conviction.
But I do not expect that he will do so, simply because it could be bad
for business.

[Such accommodation is no longer news and certainly not unique to
**Alaska**]{.underline}. What is [really attention-grabbing is the speed
with which this bonding with China is becoming a mainstay in the
Arctic]{.underline}. China's willingness to finance huge industrial
projects and infrastructure is so tempting that none of the Arctic
governments will want to lose out. Even super-rich Norway has adjusted.
After 50 years with a hugely successful oil-and-gas sector, Norway
commands the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, holding a
staggering \$1 trillion and growing by the hour. In 2010
[**[Norway]{.mark}** [awarded]{.mark} the Nobel [Peace Prize to]{.mark}
Liu Xiaobo, a [Chinese human rights advocate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Then,
in 2016, [[after]{.mark} years of [being stonewalled by China]{.mark}
and losing business]{.underline}, [[Norway]{.mark} signed an
[agree]{.mark}ment with China promising basically, if not explicitly,
[never to do it again]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[Beijing's]{.mark}** overarching [approach to]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}** region is framed by China's 2018 Arctic White
Paper,]{.underline} a document which harmonized years of political
statements into a coherent (albeit general) set of regional ambitions.
[This policy [focuses on]{.mark} four key areas: **[shipping]{.mark}**,
**[resource development]{.mark}**, **[regional governance]{.mark}**, and
**[science]{.mark}**. [Underlying]{.mark} these specific priorities
[is]{.mark} an ever-present and overarching [theme of respect and
participation]{.mark}]{.underline}: respect for China's interests in the
Arctic and for the involvement of non-Arctic states in the region. [It
asserts that [China]{.mark} [is an important actor]{.mark} with a say in
regional development and governance, as well as a [responsible]{.mark}
and [reliable partner]{.mark} for Arctic states.]{.underline}

[[Chinese]{.mark} strategic messaging with [respect to]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} [promotes]{.mark} an [image]{.mark} [of China as a
peaceful]{.mark} and [friendly]{.mark} world power [seeking
"win-win]{.mark}" economic [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 This
narrative is [[common]{.mark} to Chinese messaging [around the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beijing's [[purpose]{.mark} is [to
blunt]{.mark} foreign [criticism]{.mark} [while]{.mark} [facilitating
investment]{.mark}, [sci]{.mark}entific [collab]{.mark}oration, and the
entrenchment of Chinese facilities and programs in foreign
states]{.underline}. This supposed [[win-win approach]{.mark} toward the
Arctic is designed [to]{.mark} [facilitate access to shipping
routes]{.mark},]{.underline} Chinese direct foreign investment in energy
and mining projects, Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure
projects, and (potentially dual-purpose) scientific research. The Arctic
still holds the promise of resources and shipping routes that could one
day be important as part of a global BRI as a Polar Silk Road (PSR).14
Many of these resources are still not economically viable, however, and
polar ice continues to obstruct potential shipping lanes and present
uncertainty for shipping interests. As such, [China's [short-term Arctic
interests]{.mark} are [more modest than]{.mark} many [West]{.mark}ern

[FDI appears to be an important targeted tool that [PRC-based
entities]{.mark} use to [secure rights to]{.mark} the [Arctic's natural
resources]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[develop the infrastructure to
support Arctic shipping routes]{.underline}]{.mark}. PRC-based
[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} have also [[undertaken]{.mark} a number
of [contracts to construct]{.mark} various [infrastructure
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, [**[helping China to
establish a physical presence]{.mark}** there.]{.underline} This
suggests that PRC FDI and the activities of PRC-based construction firms
in the Arctic warrant careful evaluation to determine whether they pose
potential security risks to the US and its allies and partners in the
region.

PRC [projects are likely to continue to face pushback from Arctic
states]{.underline}. Several [[Arctic states have]{.mark} [blocked PRC
projects due to security concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} and domestic
political considerations that are unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
Moreover, Beijing's use of economic coercion and ["wolf warrior"
diplomacy have undermined China's efforts to improve its
image]{.underline} in the eyes of Arctic countries. [This [pushback is
likely to continue]{.mark} to constrain PRC efforts to gain a foothold
in the Arctic. How [Beijing seeks to address this challenge is an issue
that **warrants careful monitoring.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Chinese presence in the Arctic adds another layer of complexity to
the region\'s military geopolitics. Although China is not an Arctic
state, it identifies itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" and has invested
in naval and logistical capabilities to operate in the region
(Lanteigne, 2017). [[China]{.mark}\'s strategy, rooted in the theory of
a \"sphere of influence,\" [seeks to]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} its
[presence in the Arctic through economic and scientific
partnerships]{.mark}, often [challenging]{.mark} the [security interests
of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and other Western
countries.]{.underline} This [convergence of interests generates
tensions]{.underline} that [require a coordinated response from NATO
allies]{.underline} and their partners. From the American perspective,
[[Russia]{.mark} could be [seen as a \"Chinese]{.mark} [Canada\"]{.mark}
in the Arctic context]{.underline}, given its [**[vast territorial
reach]{.mark}** in the region **[and its strategic]{.mark} [supply
of]{.mark} essential [resources ]{.mark}**[that align with China's
interests in polar infrastructure]{.mark} and logistics. This [growing
partnership]{.mark} between Russia and China in the Arctic [intensifies
competition over maritime routes and]{.mark} the [exploitation of
natural resources]{.mark},]{.underline} directly challenging the U.S.
position in the region. [[For Washington, cooperation between these
powers]{.mark} [represents a threat to]{.mark} the [stability of]{.mark}
the [polar frontier]{.mark} and the global geopolitical
balance.]{.underline} Simultaneously, the increasing importance of new
Arctic maritime routes, such as the [[Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}]{.mark}, elevates the military significance of the
region in terms of controlling strategic infrastructure and global
logistical pathways, particularly concerning Greenland (Bankes &
Koivurova, 2013). According to Emmerson (2010), these routes [could
[significantly reshape international maritime trade]{.mark}, offering
logistical advantages to countries that control their access. However,
the [militarization of these areas creates a]{.mark} [security
dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline}, as discussed by Buzan et al. (1998), since
the [[expansion]{.underline}]{.mark} of military capabilities in the
region may [[lead to escalating tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} among
rival powers.

#### China is [increasing]{.underline} economic cooperation with Russia [now]{.underline}

[[Russian and Chinese leaders]{.mark} have [exhibited]{.mark} a
[**growing ability to cooperate** despite their differing Arctic
aims]{.mark}.]{.underline} These leaders have [[developed a partnership
based on a shared interest in building the infrastructure needed to
access the region's resources.]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian companies
need investment from external sources to access deposits of liquified
natural gas. [[China]{.mark}, which has money to invest but lacks Arctic
territory in which to invest it, [is **partnering with Russia on major
infrastructure projects**, such as the Yamal LNG natural gas
project.]{.mark}]{.underline} Joint Russian and Chinese efforts to
extract Arctic resources make the region more commercially valuable to
both countries.

To expand access to raw materials in the region, Russia and China have
shown a [willingness to exploit deficiencies and ambiguities in regimes
that govern the Arctic.]{.underline} Beijing refers to the Arctic
region, in addition to the deep seabed and outer space, as "res
nullius," or "no one's property"---a region ungoverned by law and
without defined territorial holdings. So far, [[China has been unwilling
to disrupt international norms]{.mark}]{.underline} by taking steps
unilaterally to extract Arctic resources, choosing instead to partner
with Arctic powers such as Russia and Greenland on mining and drilling
projects. Chinese leaders, however, continue to define the region as
unregulated and free for economic activity. Chinese scientific activity
increasingly focuses on preparing for the direct extraction of resources
and conducting "assessments of polar oil and natural gas . . . to
explore the possibilities and means for future use." The country's
public disregard for the legal regimes governing the Arctic and its
clear focus [on [building]{.mark} the scientific knowledge and
[technical familiarity needed to mine Arctic resources clearly
illustrate Beijing's intention to expand economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} without regard for international
institutions.

### I/L---RCA Fails

#### China and Russia cooperation in the Arctic fails

**Dagaev 25** (Andrei Dagaev \[PhD student at the National Chengchi
University \], "The Arctic Is Testing the Limits of the Sino-Russian
Partnership", 2-18-2025,
https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2025/02/russia-china-arctic-views?lang=en//phs-DZ)

Over the past three years, **[[Russia's cooperation with China]{.mark}
has reached unprecedented levels]{.underline}**. Still, there is **[one
area where the two countries have been [unable to find]{.mark} common
[ground]{.mark}: the Arctic.]{.underline}** Even in the **[[current
geopolitical climate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[differences between
[Moscow and Beijing's approaches to the Arctic]{.mark} have so far
[proven too great to overcome]{.mark}, [limiting China's]{.mark}
[advances]{.mark} in the Far North.]{.underline}**

Publicly, Russia and China maintain they have a "comprehensive strategic
partnership," which ostensibly extends to Arctic issues. **[Yet their
[interests in the region can be quite
disparate]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

China first took a serious interest in the Far North in the early 2010s,
initially seeking a seat on the Arctic Council, the region's most
important multilateral organization**[. [Russia did not]{.mark}
immediately [agree to admit China]{.mark}, setting two conditions: that
China respect the sovereignty of regional powers and abide by
freedom-of-navigation rules. In 2013, China was finally granted observer
status, and with it, a platform to articulate its regional
objectives.]{.underline}**

In 2018, China's State Council published the country's first-ever white
paper on Arctic policy. **[The document described China as a
"near-Arctic state" with a vested interest in the region's affairs. It
argued that the Arctic belonged to all mankind, and so China had the
right to enter its waters and airspace, just like other "constructive"
parties.]{.underline}**

The **[[Arctic]{.mark} was easily [integrated into China's]{.mark}
global Belt and Road [Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}**---in the form of
a proposed "Polar Silk Road"---and its vision of a "Community of Common
Destiny." Overall, it **[presented Beijing with an opportunity to
burnish its image as a responsible great power.]{.underline}**

China's stated objectives in the Arctic have not changed significantly
since 2018**[. It remains committed [to conducting scientific
research]{.mark}, [conserving the region]{.mark}, carrying out
[commercial]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}, and [assisting]{.mark} with the
[Arctic's joint management in line with international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Indeed, all of China's statements and documents on the region reiterate
its willingness to engage in multilateral cooperation for the benefit of
the Arctic. Meanwhile, the military-political dimension always goes
unmentioned, with neither the 2018 white paper nor any subsequent
pronouncements hinting at the expansionist designs about which then U.S.
secretary of state Mike Pompeo warned in 2019.

**[[Russia's Arctic policy]{.mark} is [based on]{.mark} altogether
[different principles]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For Moscow, it is all
about unlocking the region's economic potential and defending
sovereignty**[. Essentially, Russia wishes to commercialize the
region---[with an emphasis on oil and gas]{.mark} exploration and the
creation of a transportation corridor---[and militarize it,
too.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Furthermore, **[[Russia would do this unilaterally]{.mark}, all
references to dialogue and [cooperation with]{.mark} regional
[partners]{.mark} having been [removed from]{.mark} the country's main
[documents on the Arctic]{.mark} amid the breakdown in its relations
with the West.]{.underline}**

**[[Unlike Beijing]{.mark}, [Moscow]{.mark} has [put]{.mark} great
[stock in]{.mark} national [projects with limited foreign
participation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Tellingly, the Northern Sea Route
is treated by the Kremlin as a domestic transport route. **[While [China
welcomes]{.mark} the [internationalization]{.mark} of the Arctic's
transportation corridors, [Russia has resisted]{.mark} this trend in
favor of autarky.]{.underline}**

This **[[fundamental disagreement]{.mark} has long [hampered Russia's
cooperation with China on Arctic issues]{.mark} in every area except oil
and gas]{.underline}**. In the 2010s, the two countries actively
collaborated on oil and gas projects in the Arctic, many of which the
Chinese financed, much to Russia's gratitude, particularly after the
West imposed the first sanctions against it in 2014.

However, **[this [partnership could not be extended to other areas of
cooperation]{.mark}. Take infrastructure]{.underline}**: in 2016, the
state-owned China Poly Group signed a memorandum of understanding with
the Arkhangelsk region administration on the construction of a deep-sea
port in Arkhangelsk. **[[China]{.mark} was [expected to invest]{.mark}
\$78 million in the project and connect the port with the proposed
Belkomur railway line. [But]{.mark} the [project never
transpired]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### No Sino-Russia Arctic Alliance now but U.S actions drive them together.

**Buchanan 24** (Elizabeth Buchanan \[Associate Researcher with the
French Ministry of Armed Forces' strategic research institute\], "Why
Russia and China Won't Go the Distance in the High North", 5-8-2024,
https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-russia-and-china-wont-go-distance-high-north//phs-DZ)

China is also driven by great power ideology and the prestige afforded
by having a global polar footprint. Russia is aware of this simmering
rationale for Chinese Arctic strategy**[. [Efforts by]{.mark} [China to
move beyond]{.mark} the agreed [terms of]{.mark} its mutually beneficial
[arrangement with Moscow]{.mark} within the Russian Arctic Zone, and how
closely China adheres to the existing legal and sovereign arrangements
of the Arctic Ocean, will certainly be [a]{.mark} litmus [test
for]{.mark} the [Sino-Russian Arctic 'alliance']{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[Sino[-Russian]{.mark} strategic [tensions remain]{.mark},
well [beyond]{.mark} the overhanging [fear of centuries of
mistrust]{.mark} and the issue of the Russian Far East]{.underline}**.
In June 2020, **[[Moscow accused]{.mark} one of its leading [Arctic
scientists]{.mark}, Valery Mitko, [of spying for Beijing]{.mark}. Mitko
was charged with treason for handing over classified information on
Arctic research and submarine sensor technology to China.]{.underline}**
But perhaps more telling is the way that both countries have hushed up
the incident, with neither formally commenting on the arrest. For now,
Beijing and Moscow appear to agree to disagree -- so long as Arctic LNG
business is booming.

The narrative of Moscow and Beijing working together to carve up the
Arctic riches and take control of new global transport corridors has
started to make its way into the policy and defence planning documents
of Arctic-rim states. Washington's litany of Arctic strategic planning
documents -- Naval, Air Force and Coast Guard strategies -- feature
renewed great power competition in the Arctic as a central security
threat. **[However, the [notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic
alliance]{.mark} is a [misinterpretation of]{.mark} the [realities that
drive China and]{.mark} [Russia together in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The realities of the Sino-Russian relationship]{.underline}** (dubbed
by both as one of 'mutual benefit') **[in the [Arctic]{.mark} is [best
grasped when]{.mark} the [limits of]{.mark} the [partnership are
considered]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are, first and foremost,
**[[limits in terms of geographical boundaries]{.mark}. The [Russian
Arctic Zone]{.mark} is the lion's share of the Arctic region, home to
the NSR and a vast percentage of Arctic resources. The Russian Arctic
Zone is also the [geographical 'limit' of Sino-Russian Arctic
'cooperation']{.mark} as well.]{.underline}**

Of the eight members of the Arctic Council, **[[Russia took]{.mark} the
[most convincing to grant China]{.mark} its [observer status]{.mark} in
2013]{.underline}**. Moscow approved membership, and with it,
legitimacy, on the basis that Beijing explicitly acknowledged the
sovereignty of Arctic-rim states and reaffirmed its commitment to the
legal architecture of the Arctic region -- the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea.

**[[Russia watches]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} tempered [suspicion]{.mark},
Beijing's Arctic high sea missions and scientific research agenda [in
what China sees as]{.mark} a [global
common]{.mark}]{.underline}**[s]{.mark}. Yet within the Russian Arctic
Zone, **[[Russia welcomes Chinese engagement]{.mark}, but [on Kremlin
terms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since 2014, with Western sanctions over
Russia's annexation of Crimea and sustained aggression in Ukraine,
Moscow has had a cashflow problem.

## Pandemics 

### I/L---AT: China Key

#### China faces many challenges in attempt to be a global leader in healthcare.

Jiyong **Jin '24** , \[Jiyong Jin is a professor and deputy dean in the
School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Shanghai
International Studies University, China. \"China\'s Foreign Policy and
Global Health Leadership,\" Think Global Health,
https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/chinas-foreign-policy-and-global-health-leadership\]

Despite making significant contributions to global health, **[[China
faces challenges]{.mark} that [hold back]{.mark} its [ability to
be]{.mark} a [global health leader]{.mark}. It is [not well prepared
strategically or institutionally]{.mark} [to achieve]{.mark} and sustain
such [leadership]{.mark}. [China has no overarching global health
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}** to guide its diplomatic efforts. The
absence of a strategy handicaps its ability to optimize its foreign
policy for both **[[health promotion and political benefits]{.mark}. The
[lack reflects]{.mark} the [tensions]{.mark} [among China\'s global
health]{.mark}]{.underline}** ambitions, economic imperatives, and
geopolitical interests. Chinese foreign policy on global health is
vulnerable to external and internal factors On the one hand, China\'s
desire to build a global health community is rooted in its vision for a
new, more inclusive international system that promotes a [shared future
for
mankind](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbzhd/202403/t20240308_11256416.html),
captured in the concept that the \"[world is for
all](https://www.thechinastory.org/yearbooks/yearbook-2013/forum-politics-and-society/tianxia-%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B/).\"
On the other, China\'s strategic concerns, economic interests, and
institutional dynamics increasingly influence its health diplomacy.
Chinese foreign policy on global health is vulnerable to external and
internal factors. **[[Strategic competition between China and Western
nations]{.mark} [makes geopolitical calculations more important]{.mark}
in China\'s global health policies. The challenges facing the Chinese
economy have created incentives [to elevate domestic economic
growth]{.mark} as a priority in China\'s global health engagement.
Institutionally, the [Chinese government lacks]{.mark} a
[mechanism]{.mark} [to coordinate]{.mark} the [global health
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}** of its various bodies. The National
Health Commission does not have the authority to align government
ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Development Cooperation Agency, on global health activities. The lack of
such coordination means that China often conducts its health diplomacy
in a piecemeal fashion. **[Those [strategic, economic, and institutional
challenges underscore]{.mark} that [China\'s foreign policy on global
health]{.mark} [needs top-level reforms to enable Chinese health
diplomacy]{.mark} [to have]{.mark} greater, more sustainable health
[impact]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### US key to Global Health and Infrastructure not China due to relations it has with other countries 

Stephanie **Oum '24** \[Stephanie Oum is a senior policy analyst with
the Global Health & HIV Policy program at KFF, where her work focuses on
the U.S. government's role in global health. \] The US Goverment

The [[U.S. role in global health]{.mark} is
[multifaceted]{.mark}]{.underline} and includes a broad range of
activities. Its primary roles are as a supporter of bilateral (i.e.,
country-to-country) efforts, [directly [funding]{.mark} [implementation
of global health]{.mark} efforts]{.underline} in partner countries, and
as a donor to multilateral health institutions (i.e., international
organizations that pool support from multiple countries for one or more
areas of global health). The [[U.S.]{.mark} also [engages in]{.mark}
global [health diplomacy through]{.mark} its [relationships]{.mark} with
other governments]{.underline}, multilateral institutions,
non-governmental organizations, and the private sector. Specifically,
the U.[S. [government]{.mark}: [acts as a donor by providing financial
and]{.mark} other [health]{.mark}-related development
[assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. commodities, like contraceptives
or bed nets for protection from disease-carrying mosquitoes) to low- and
middle-income countries; operates programs and delivers health services;
provides technical assistance and other capacity-building support;
participates in major international health organizations and coordinates
health efforts with other stakeholders through global health diplomacy;
conducts research; supports international responses to disasters and
other emergencies; and partners with governments, non-governmental
groups, and the private sector (Figure 1).

#### China leading the WHO allows China to manipulate public health for China's Agenda 

Yanzhong **Huang '25**\[Yanzhong Huang is a senior fellow for global
health at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he directs the Global
Health Governance roundtable series, \"U.S. WHO Exit Could Expand
China\'s Influence,\" Think Global Health,
https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/us-who-exit-could-expand-chinas-influence\]

Hours after his second inauguration, President Donald [[Trump]{.mark}
[announced]{.mark} that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would
withdraw]{.mark} [from]{.mark}]{.underline} the World Health
Organization ([WHO]{.underline}). To justify the decision, Trump
[cited](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/)
both the organization\'s alleged susceptibility to [[China\'s
\"inappropriate political influence\" and the disproportionate financial
burden]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, noting that [[despite China\'s
population]{.mark} [being]{.mark} three times [larger]{.mark},
[Beijing\'s contributions]{.mark} to the WHO
[remain]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly 90% [[smaller]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Yet even the staunchest supporters of Trump\'s decision find themselves
contemplating an uncomfortable truth: Washington\'s withdrawal could
inadvertently pave the way for Beijing\'s expanded influence in global
health governance. The notion that China must---or will---fill the
United States\' shoes at the WHO, however, fundamentally misreads
Beijing\'s approach to global health leadership. China\'s strained
relationship with the WHO and its clear preference for bilateral aid
give it little appetite for matching U.S. contributions. Yet this might
hardly matter. Through its Health Silk Road initiative, strategic
personnel placement, and growing influence among developing nations,
Beijing is carving a path to global health leadership that doesn\'t
require writing big checks to Geneva. As Trump pursues a [potential G2
arrangement](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-raises-prospects-negotiated-reset-us-china-ties-2025-01-21/)
with China and retreats from international institutions and commitments,
he could help Beijing achieve precisely what his WHO withdrawal aimed to
prevent: China\'s dominant influence in the international health agency.

blessings instead of unloading one's problems (報喜不報憂)," [local
authorities have been required to use a high degree of political
judgment when dealing with crises and deciding when to report them to
the Central Committee.]{.mark}]{.underline} Ma Guoqiang (馬國強), the
[[secretary of the Wuhan municipal party committee,
explained]{.underline}]{.mark} in an interview with the central
television network of the CCP that [the relevant [status of]{.mark} the
[outbreak]{.mark} was [reported to the N]{.mark}ational [H]{.mark}ealth
[C]{.mark}ommittee at the central level [on]{.mark} December 31,
[2019]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, [[until January]{.mark} 19, the
[Wuhan Municipal Health and Medical]{.mark} Committee]{.underline}
(衛生健康委員會) [still [insisted]{.mark} that [there was]{.mark} "no
obvious human-to-human transmission" and "[no medical
infection.]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} On January 20, 2020, the
Central Committee designated coronavirus as a "category B infectious
disease," and Hubei Province further [adopted stricter disease control
measures]{.underline}. Later, the Central Committee sent a team to Wuhan
to conduct an investigation. To some extent, this indicates that the
central government had been placing the responsibilities for epidemic
control with local governments.

[The **[CCP's hierarchical authorization system ignores]{.mark} the fact
that [disease prevention cannot be]{.mark} [divided by geographical
boundaries and administrative regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When Wuhan
Mayor Zhou Xianwang (周先旺) was interviewed by China Central Television
(CCTV) on January 27, he explained that [according to the "Law on
Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases," the [Wuhan
government]{.mark} [needed to first report]{.mark} [to the central
government and obtain "authorization" before it could disclose
relevant]{.mark} [information to the public.]{.mark}]{.underline} Due to
the lack of the CCP Central Committee's unified handling of the
situation and unclear policy instructions, [local governments could not
limit the movement of the large numbers of people traveling during the
Chinese Lunar New Year.]{.underline} As a result, local [[cover-ups and
national bureaucratic]{.mark} [inefficiency]{.mark} also [allowed
COVID-19 to spread to other provinces]{.mark} in China [and other
countries]{.mark} around the world.]{.underline}

In October 2019, the [Johns Hopkins Center for Health

the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) jointly [released [the Global
Health Security Index]{.mark} (GHS Index). Through 6 categories, 34
indicators, 85 sub-indicators, and 140 questions]{.underline}, this
index comprehensively assessed the capability of 195 countries to
prevent and mitigate epidemics and pandemics, which had been considered
the most authoritative assessment and benchmarking of public health
security capability. In the GHS Index, [[the U.S. ranked 1st]{.mark},
with a score of 83.5, [rating as the country most capable of preventing
and mitigating]{.mark} epidemics and [pandemics,]{.mark} whereas [China
ranked 51st,]{.mark} with a score of 48.2, [which was]{.mark} not only
[**far from all major Western developed countries,** but also behind
countries that were **less developed**]{.mark} than China, [such as
Indonesia, Peru, and Vietnam.]{.mark}]{.underline} Dramatically, [a few
months [after the index was released, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread
rapidly worldwide,]{.mark} and was declared a global pandemic by the
World Health Organization]{.underline} (hereafter WHO) on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 May 2023, COVID-19 has spread to 235 countries and territories,
with more than 6.92 million cumulative deaths worldwide \[1\]. Global
excess deaths associated with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31
December 2021 were approximately 14.9 million \[2\]. [COVID-19

2\. Public health response

**[One of the strongest lessons from]{.underline}** the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic **[is that simple
[non-pharma]{.mark}ceutical [interventions such as
masking]{.mark}]{.underline}**, social
**[[distancing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[and travel
restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[can be highly
effective]{.underline}]{.mark}** if governments have the will to enforce
them. For example, a study in Nature of **[early COVID [measures
in]{.mark}]{.underline}** mainland **[[China
found]{.underline}]{.mark}** that non-pharmaceutical
**[[interventions]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[reduced cases
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[a factor of 67]{.underline}]{.mark}** by
the end of February 2020. Here are their estimates for the course of the
outbreak in Wuhan (b) and Hubei (f) with and without intervention.

That is not to say that non-pharmaceutical interventions are a panacea.
They work less well when they are not consistently enforced. And in the
case of China, they ultimately failed to counteract the effects of
insufficient vaccination among the elderly. But used properly,
non-pharmaceutical interventions are a remarkably effective tool in
slowing the spread of disease.

Another novel feature of the COVID-19 pandemic is that, for the first
time, **[an active pandemic was brought to an end through]{.underline}**
real-time **[development and deployment of vaccines]{.underline}**.
Although vaccines took over a year to bring to market, **[serviceable
[vaccines were]{.mark}]{.underline}** quite **[[quick]{.mark} to
develop]{.underline}**, **[[and a society facing existential catastrophe
might]{.underline}]{.mark}** well **[[bring a]{.mark} serviceable
[vaccine]{.mark} to market [far more quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[on]{.mark} a scale of [months or]{.mark} even
[weeks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[and advances in medical
tech]{.underline}**nology **[might]{.underline}**
**[bring]{.underline}** **[further improvements]{.underline}** beyond
this. This would be **[[particularly]{.underline}]{.mark}** true **[[if
societies]{.mark} were willing to [loosen restrictions on]{.mark} [human
trials]{.mark} and regulatory approval, [which a society facing
existential catastrophe]{.mark} might well [do]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

It is hard to exaggerate how novel and exciting this development is.
Historically, societies have been unable to develop novel pharmaceutical
responses to pandemic pathogens in time to affect the course of an
initial pandemic. This would be deeply frightening in the face of
potentially sophisticated engineered pathogens. But **[it is not just
our ability to engineer pathogens that is advancing]{.underline}**. We
are also increasingly gaining the ability to develop effective vaccines
to counter novel pathogens.

Would-be omnicidal bioterrorists need to develop a pathogen that is not
only in principle able to destroy all living humans, but which will
succeed in practice despite our best efforts to stop it. **[[Humans are
not sitting ducks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and we are unlikely to take a
world-ending pandemic complacently.

#### Human history denies.

4\. Human history

**[We have experienced [a great number of]{.mark} catastrophic
[pandemics]{.mark} throughout human history. These pandemics have all
fallen far short of existential catastrophe]{.underline}**: indeed,
**[they have]{.underline}** often **[[failed to cause even
local]{.underline}]{.mark}** forms of societal
**[[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and only extremely rarely if ever
caused a region to become uninhabited for any significant amount of
time.

One of the best known pandemics is the \`Black Death' which swept Europe
from 1346 to 1352. Though the pandemic led to massive loss of life,
there was little evidence of societal collapse or even breakdown of
large-scale social institutions. The historian John Haldon and
colleagues write:

Claims of mortality rates of as much as 50% give the impression that
this event must have been devastating for the societies affected. Yet
when we examine how different states and societies responded, we find
that---without minimizing the terrible impact on people and
communities---**[[the medieval world did not grind to a
halt]{.underline}]{.mark}**, still less did a series of revolutionary
transformations occur. Indeed, **[the Black Death struck at the
beginning of the Hundred Years' War]{.underline}**, and in spite of its
demographic impact both the kingdoms of England and France continued to
field effective armies, even if there was a brief pause in hostilities
(similar to contemporary calls for ceasefires in ongoing international
conflicts in the context of COVID-19). Instead, some societal
developments that were already under way accelerated while various
groups within society responded by exploiting their situation and
attempting to slow down, stop or otherwise control changes which they
perceived as disadvantageous.

**[Still more devastating pandemics]{.underline}**, **[combined with
other risk hazards]{.underline}** such as brutal colonial expansion,
**[have still been frequently unable to produce even
regional]{.underline}** societal **[collapse]{.underline}**. For
example, the political scientist Alberto Diaz-Cayeros and colleagues
study the combined effect of pandemic, violence and other colonialist
disasters on Mexico from the mid-1500s onwards. Despite dramatic loss of
life (average settlement population fell 95% by 1646), most settlements
survived, and 13% even grew by the end of the colonial period. They
write:

We develop a new disaggregated dataset on pre-Conquest economic,
epidemiological and political conditions both in 11,888 potential
settlement locations in the historic core of Mexico and in 1,093 actual
Conquest-era city-settlements. Of these 1,093 settlements, we show that
36% had disappeared entirely by 1790. Yet, despite being subject to
Conquest-era violence, subsequent coercion and multiple pandemics that
led average populations in those settlements to fall from 2,377 to 128
by 1646, 13% would still end the colonial era larger than they started.

**[Human [history is replete with]{.mark} such [examples of
resilience]{.mark} not only [to]{.mark} pandemics]{.underline}**,
**[but]{.underline}** also to **[[the combination of pandemics
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** numerous **[[other
catastrophes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[If]{.mark} our [ancestors could
survive]{.mark}]{.underline}** and flourish **[[with
little]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the way of **[modern [medical
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}** or technology, then **[[we should
be]{.underline}]{.mark}**come relatively more **[[confident in our own
ability]{.mark} to survive future pandemics]{.underline}**.

5\. Mammalian history

It is not just human history that provides tales of resilience.
Throughout history, there is only one recorded instance in which disease
has led to the extinction of a mammalian species. Don't take it from me
-- here are Piers Millett and Andrew Snyder-Beattie:

**[The number of mammalian species that have gone extinct due to
disease]{.underline}** (as opposed to other factors)
**[is]{.underline}** very limited, with just **[1]{.underline}**
confirmed example.

**[The confirmed example is]{.underline}** the extinction of
**[a]{.underline}** species of **[rat]{.underline}** in a very small and
remote location (Christmas Island).

While we might take the relatively larger incidence of disease-driven
extinction in non-mammalian species as evidence of the threat posed to
such species, **[[if the closest thing to]{.mark} a mammalian
[extinction]{.mark} that [we can pin on]{.mark} pandemic [disease
is]{.mark} the extinction of [an isolated]{.mark} species of
[rat]{.mark}]{.underline}**, then **[[we should be hesitant to
place]{.mark} too much [stock in the idea]{.mark} that [humanity
is]{.mark} soon [to be driven extinct]{.mark} by disease]{.underline}**.

### Misc---Chang Indict

#### Chang is government-funded [Sinophobe]{.underline} that commonly spouts racist [rhetoric]{.underline}---reject him on face.

Often, **[[Chang\'s gloom-and-doom articles are
self-contradictory]{.mark}. In one breath, [he declares China \"a sick
lizard]{.mark}\". In the next, he calls China an existential threat to
America and the world. [He blames China for anything and
everything]{.mark} that goes wrong in America, from [global supply
chains disruptions to Houthi attacks]{.mark} on American
forces]{.underline}**. As one reader puts it, if we ask Gordon G. Chang,
**[he [would say]{.mark} that China is also [behind the UFO
attacks]{.mark} on America.]{.underline}**

They say that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. How true of
Chang. Trading on his Chinese surname, **[he claims [non-existent
expertise]{.mark} on Chinese history and culture]{.underline}**. As
proof of China\'s imperial ambitions, **[he cites the ancient Chinese
concept of \"[Tianxia\", or \"all under heaven]{.mark}\", which he
promptly takes out of context, [twisting it into a desire for world
domination]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, it is a **[Confucian ideal
promoting humanity\'s common destiny]{.underline}**. Chang is no
truth-seeker or impartial analyst. He is a pathetic soul tortured by his
own identity crisis, **[[driven by an urge to outdo white
supremacists]{.mark} in demonizing a peaceful China.]{.underline}**

**[If you scan the titles of his articles, the [evil intent jumps out at
you]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I get clinically depressed reading his crazy
rantings. He is **[[spewing an ocean of venom]{.mark} to drown China in
hatred]{.underline}**. Here is a partial list from his warped mind and
poison pen:

• \"**[[China is fueling Hamas]{.mark} attacks\"]{.underline}**

• \"Fresno Lab: **[China\'s [Operation to Exterminate
Americans]{.mark}\"]{.underline}**

• \"The **[West Must Bring China Down\"]{.underline}**

• \"The **[[Chinese Dream is the Complete Control of
Humanity]{.mark}\"]{.underline}**

• \"Our **[Response to China must be Overwhelming]{.underline}**, not
Proportional\"

• \"Preparing for War with China\"

• \"China\'s **[[Saboteurs are coming to
America]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"

• \"**[[Close all China Consulates]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Slash Embassy
Staff.\"

• \"Expropriate China-owned Farmland in America\"

• \"Deterring China: US should arm Taiwan to the hilt---now\"

Dripping with venom, these views are calculated to provoke the two
biggest powers into a history-ending all-out war. According to European
reports, the **[[US is pumping \$1.5 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** into
the training of Western journalists **[to bad-mouth China. Chang [ought
to get a lion\'s share]{.mark} of this largess]{.underline}**. I wonder
if someone has desecrated his ancestral graves for him to harbor such
bone-deep enmity.

Utterly shameless, **[Chang [dishonestly cloaks his arguments in
selective statistics and quotes from self-proclaimed
experts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He believes that the US-China conflict
is inevitable, and that China is already on a war footing. He is doing
his utmost to hasten that inevitability, **[[accusing China of
\"inciting violence]{.mark} on American streets\" and of [\"stoking
racial tensions]{.mark} in the US\", and even of \"[advocating the
extermination of Americans]{.mark} with disease\" so [that \"the Chinese
people could settle in the vast spaces left
uninhabited]{.mark}\".]{.underline}** He makes the over-the-top,
fact-free claim that China is \"attempting to take down our
government\", and of ultimately \"overthrowing\" the so-called
\"rules-based international system\". These are the unmistakable
babblings of a sick mind.

**[Loved by Fox News and other right-wing outlets]{.underline}**, his
notoriety is entrenched. Unfortunately, it has made life miserable for
another Chinese-American by the same name, Gordon H. Chang, a noted
Stanford historian, separated from his namesake by just a middle
initial. The former laments that the latter has been \"the bane of my
life\".

Had Chang been a pure white American, his failed predictions would have
torpedoed his career. But ironically, his \"Chinese half\" has come to
his rescue, lending him false legitimacy as a born China oracle. He is a
bane of peace-lovers on both sides of the East-West divide. **[He has
sold his soul to Satan. If he is not the devil incarnate, who
is?]{.underline}**
