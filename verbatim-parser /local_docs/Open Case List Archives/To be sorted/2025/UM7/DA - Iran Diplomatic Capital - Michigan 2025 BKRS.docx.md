### Notes

This is the Iran Dip Cap da. It is like a politics da, but instead of
arguing that the plan forces tradeoffs within congress, it argues that
the plan forces a tradeoff in diplomatic resources/credibility
internationally. Specifically, it argues that focusing on the Arctic
trades off with effectively managing diplomacy with Iran.

#### Both sides want a deal, but the margin for error is slim and now is key

**Sharifi 7-10**, feature writer specializing in Iranian affairs in
RFE/RL\'s Central Newsroom in Prague. (Kian Sharifi, 7-10-2025, "Iran-US
Nuclear Talks Set To Resume For First Time Since 12-Day War Amid Deep
Mistrust"
https://www.rferl.org/a/us-iran-nuclear-talks-diplomacy-tensions-high/33469536.html)

**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[and Iran]{.underline}** **[are poised to return to the negotiating
table]{.underline}**]{.mark} at a moment when tensions between the two
are high and trust is low.

The talks were initially planned for July 10 in Oslo, according to
RFE/RL's sources, who now say the meeting has been postponed \-- likely
to next week.

Whenever they take place, **[the talks will mark a potential restart of
nuclear diplomacy between the longtime adversaries]{.underline}** just
weeks after joint Israeli-US air strikes targeted Iranian nuclear sites.

Israel launched its attack on Iran on June 13, just two days before
Tehran and Washington were scheduled to hold a sixth round of
negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.

US President Donald Trump then authorized joining Israel in striking
Iranian nuclear facilities. Afterward, Washington brokered a cease-fire
agreement to put a halt to the hostilities.

In a July 8 opinion article for the Financial Times, Iranian Foreign
Minister Abbas Araqchi questioned how Tehran could "trust further
engagement" after witnessing "our good will reciprocated with an attack
by two nuclear-armed militaries."

While **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** has spoken about reaching a
"permanent deal" with Iran, he has not outlined what such an agreement
would involve.

But his **[latest [moves suggest a shift]{.mark} from short-term crisis
management [to a broader strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}** \-- one
**[aimed at [securing a deal that addresses Iran's nuclear
program]{.mark}]{.underline}**, regional influence, **[and the Middle
East's wider security architecture.]{.underline}**

**[[Iran has insisted]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- even after the 12-day
war with Israel \-- **[that [it remains committed to
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[though it has asked for assurances
that any deal will prevent Israel from launching further
attacks]{.underline}**.

Since the cease-fire went into force on June 24, Trump has sent mixed
signals about whether pursuing a deal with Iran is still worthwhile,
given the current state of its nuclear program.

The US president claims the strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear
facilities. Iran has acknowledged that the sites have suffered extensive
damage but has vowed to press on with its nuclear program and,
crucially, uranium enrichment.

**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** may have lost leverage after the
strikes, but it **[[still holds some cards.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Before the strikes, Iran had amassed over 400 kg of uranium enriched to
60 percent \-- a short step from weapons-grade \-- and reportedly moved
some of it to undisclosed locations.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it does not know the
whereabouts of all this material.

Iran, meanwhile, has suspended cooperation with inspectors and suggested
that information shared by the UN nuclear watchdog may have enabled the
strikes \-- raising concerns it could be edging toward a full withdrawal
from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

But Trump has warned that he will order another bombing campaign if Iran
resumes high-level uranium enrichment.

Still, **[[Tehran and Washington insist they want
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but **[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**
arguably **[[needs a deal]{.mark}]{.underline}** more than the United
States. **[[In the absence of an agreement, not only will the threat of
further military action remain, but Iran will also risk being hit by UN
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that European powers have threatened to
reimpose.

Whether the upcoming talks in Oslo yield real progress or simply buy
time, one thing is clear: the road back to diplomacy runs through a
minefield of mistrust, missed chances, and mutual threats. [**[Both
sides are still talking]{.underline}** \-- **[but the ever-closing
window for a deal may finally be closing for
real.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

#### Diplomatic capital is key to deal success

Areeba **Kanwal 6-25** \[Areeba Kanwal; Areeba Kanwal is a contributor
at The Diplomatic Insight and has passion for International Relations
and diplomacy; 6-29-2025; Peace Through Strength or Smoke & Mirrors? The
Fragility of Iran--Israel Truce; Diplomatic Insight;
https://thediplomaticinsight.com/peace-through-strength-or-smoke-and-mirrors;
Accessed 6-28-2025;\] KK

On June 23--24, **[a tenuous [ceasefire]{.mark} was [declared]{.mark}
between Israel and Iran]{.underline}** after 12 days of intense military
exchanges, including Israeli airstrikes deep into Iran and missile
barrages from Tehran.

Hailed by former **[US President Trump as [a diplomatic
triumph]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and a proof point for "**[peace through
strength]{.underline}**"---the moment raises a critical question:
**[does the outcome reflect genuine security gains, or mere smoke and
mirrors?]{.underline}**

On paper, Israel achieved a striking military success: its Operation
Rising Lion struck over 100 Iranian military and nuclear sites,
reportedly backed by covert Mossad-led drone sabotage that crippled
missile-launch capabilities. Israel and allied reporting often claim a
severe blow to Iran's nuclear ambitions---a rhetoric echoed in domestic
editorials praising restored deterrence .

**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** fresh **[intelligence suggests [the
damage]{.mark} may [only cause a]{.mark} nuclear [delay of a few
months]{.mark}]{.underline}**---not a decisive setback . Meanwhile,
**[Iran's [enriched uranium]{.mark} stockpile [and nuclear momentum
remain]{.mark}]{.underline}** stubbornly resilient.

The Incomplete Script: What the Truce Doesn't Fix

First, the **[[ceasefire did not]{.mark} wholly [halt
hostilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Skirmishes continue]{.mark}d
immediately]{.underline}**---Israeli strikes persisted even after the
official truce, while Iran responded with missile outbursts . **[Trump's
own admonishment of Israel]{.underline}**---shouting from the White
House lawn that "Israel...dropped a load of bombs" after
ceasefire---underscored the ongoing volatility. The result? A fragile
peace, not a firm resolution.

Second, **[[Iran retains]{.mark} strategic
[leverage]{.mark}]{.underline}**: its **[[influence]{.mark} via
proxies]{.underline}**, control over the **[[Strait of
Hormuz]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
**[latent [nuclear capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}** all remained intact.
**[Tehran]{.underline}** hasn't capitulated; instead, it's **[preparing
internal reforms, tougher nuclear policies, and legislative measures to
restrict IAEA oversight .]{.underline}**

Third, while **[Israel]{.underline}** bolsters its deterrent image, it
also deepens its **[dependence on U.S. protection]{.underline}**. The
near-paratrooper interdependence---with American B‑2 bombers, U.S.
diplomatic muscle, and Trump's real‑time interventions---reveals a
paradox: strength without autonomy .

Politics Over Peace: Domestic Agendas Driving Strategy

This **[[ceasefire is]{.mark} as [political]{.mark}]{.underline}** as it
is strategic. For Trump, it's a much-needed foreign policy victory ahead
of the 2026 midterms, reinforcing his image as a tough-on-terror
statesman.

For Netanyahu, the narrative of victory over Iran supports his
agenda---especially as he shifts domestic attention toward Gaza while
leveraging unity from across Israeli politics.

Yet **[this hunger for political capital may compromise long-term
stability]{.underline}**. With neither side conceding fundamental
interests---nuclear restraint, regional influence, or formal peace---the
truce risks becoming a transient exploit, not a bridge.

A Fragile Truce, Not a Foundation

What we witness today is a truce, not a peace. Iran's willingness to
strike globally; Israel's readiness to bomb inside Iran;
**[[U.S.]{.mark} diplomacy]{.underline}** ready to berate an ally
mid‑strike---this volatile mix underscores how brittle the arrangement
is.

For lasting peace, military strength must be paired with bold diplomacy.
Yet **[[diplomatic channels]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially
**[[around Iran's nuclear program, remain
dormant]{.underline}]{.mark}**---at least **[[until]{.mark}
[now]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China, Qatar, and other regional players
urge negotiation, but none push beyond temporary kinship.

**[[The real litmus]{.underline}]{.mark}** test: **[Will]{.underline}**
these **[[powers invest serious dip]{.mark}lomatic
[cap]{.mark}ital---[revive nuclear talks]{.mark}, [address]{.mark}
Iran's [regional behavior]{.mark}, incentivize restraint]{.underline}**?
Or will they rely again on force and theatrics?

Despite his equivocations, however, **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** has

wtk

Even as a ceasefire has ended the so-called twelve-day war between
Israel and Iran, the dust has yet to settle. **[[The]{.mark} slow-moving
[crisis]{.mark} [around Iran's]{.mark} potential [nuclear weapons
ambitions is escalating]{.mark} [in ways that could have far-reaching
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
**[[increased likelihood of]{.mark} further [conflict to lasting damage
to the international institutions]{.mark} critical to
[preventing]{.mark} the spread of [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Iran's New Nuclear Law

Last week, **[Iran's president signed a law mandating]{.underline}**
that all **[cooperation with the]{.underline}** International Atomic
Energy Agency (**[IAEA]{.underline}**) be suspended. This measure marks
a new period of acrimonious relations in an already turbulent
relationship between Tehran and the IAEA. Depending on implementation,
the law could prevent the IAEA from carrying out its mandate to verify
Iran's compliance with its nonproliferation safeguards agreement unless
and until certain conditions are met.

In practice, **[this means the international community will have no
authoritative eyes on the Iranian nuclear program for the
foreseeable]{.underline}** future. Although individual countries'
intelligence services will continue to scrutinize Iran's activities,
they are not an adequate substitute for the IAEA's independent,
on-the-ground assessments.

**[[Barring IAEA inspections carries]{.mark} two [risks]{.mark} for the
unfolding Iranian nuclear crisis]{.underline}**. First, **[the [absence
of agency monitoring will create gaps in accounting for Iran's nuclear
materials]{.mark}]{.underline}** and equipment at a time when
accountancy could not be more important to reassuring the world that
Tehran is not seeking nuclear weapons. **[As [Iran]{.mark} assesses the
damage sustained from]{.underline}** the U.S. and Israeli
**[strikes]{.underline}** against its key nuclear facilities, **[it
[will have an easier job hiding]{.mark} any salvaged [assets]{.mark}
necessary for a weapons program]{.underline}** than if IAEA inspections
were ongoing. Second, **[[intelligence disputes around Iran's nuclear
activities will likely continue]{.underline}]{.mark}**, leading to
fractures in the international community---and potentially even within
individual states---on how to respond, especially if any intelligence
reports point to certain activities as evidence that Iran is sprinting
for a bomb.

Combined, **[[the potential for misperception and miscalculation caused
by less visibility into Iran's nuclear program increases the likelihood
of resumed hostilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Undermining the Nonproliferation Regime

More broadly, **[[this crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** now [**[has greater
potential to cause]{.underline}** **[far-reaching damage to
nonproliferation institutions.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The Israeli and
U.S. strikes themselves undermined the legal, economic, and diplomatic
means---including President Donald Trump's administration's own
negotiations with Tehran that had been ongoing since April---for
resolving the Iran nuclear issue peacefully. Although the attacks aimed
to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb, they very well could have
the opposite effect, merely delaying Iranian nuclear acquisition while
diminishing the efficacy of tools that prevent other states from
following suit.

**[Iran's response to the strikes stands to inflict further damage. Its
narrative around the new law]{.underline}**---namely that the IAEA bears
culpability for the strikes---**[may resonate with other countries
sympathetic to its plight.]{.underline}** These countries may perceive
the law as a justifiable response, given that Iran's safeguarded and
ostensibly civilian nuclear facilities were attacked by not one but two
nuclear-armed states. **[This]{.underline}** very concerning
**[precedent is only made worse by Israel possessing nuclear weapons
outside of international nonproliferation frameworks]{.underline}**. Of
course, this episode does not exist in a vacuum and larger dynamics may
be informing the Iranian narrative. Nevertheless, **[[Iran's actions
risk undermining the]{.mark} technical authority, [credibility]{.mark},
and independence [of the IAEA]{.mark} as the world's "nuclear
watchdog]{.underline}**." If the IAEA becomes more widely perceived as a
tool of the big powers, it will have a harder time carrying out its
mission to detect cheating by any state on its nonproliferation
obligations and provide evidence to hold them accountable.

Iranian officials maintain that their new law does not violate these
obligations, that it merely suspends (rather than terminates) its
required IAEA safeguards agreement. But this measure could very well be
a prelude to an even bigger escalation: Iran's withdrawal from the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the primary international legal
structure that prohibits the spread of nuclear weapons.

Numerous Iranian officials have pointed to this possibility in the wake
of the Israeli and especially U.S. strikes. Abbas Araghchi, Iran's
foreign minister, stated plainly that the U.S. strike "has severely
questioned the NPT, shaken the non-proliferation regime, and will have
adverse consequences for international security."

Any NPT member can withdraw from the treaty should it deem that
"extraordinary events" have jeopardized its supreme national interests.
Iran has a fairly straightforward case for invoking this withdrawal
clause by pointing to the Israeli and U.S. strikes against its nuclear
program as an extreme threat to its national security. And it could
expect to find a sympathetic ear in---or at least a lack of pushback
from---many capitals around the world that opposed the strikes.

While exiting the treaty would not necessarily be an indication of
Tehran's intent to develop nuclear weapons, it would eliminate the
international legal requirement that Iran maintain a safeguards
agreement with and submit its nuclear activities for regular monitoring
by the IAEA. This would make it exceedingly more difficult to reliably
detect whether Iran had made such a decision to go nuclear in the
future.

**[[Iranian NPT withdrawal could]{.mark} also [diminish]{.mark} other
[states' confidence in]{.mark} the [nonprolif]{.mark}eration
regime]{.underline}**. On the one hand, **[states may doubt its ability
to constrain any]{.underline}** would-be **[proliferator]{.underline}**,
let alone Iran's nuclear ambitions. On the other hand, **[they may
question its ability to protect legitimate nuclear programs from
attack]{.underline}**. **[[This]{.mark} disillusionment with the system
[could lead to further defections]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[eroding
the treaty's efficacy and fracturing]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[an
important foundation of [international peace and
security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Diminishing the credibility of the
treaty would attenuate multilateral efforts to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons, could drive more states to take military
counterproliferation actions, and at worst, could spur a proliferation
domino. **[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example, has
already said it **[[will develop nuclear weapons if Iran
does]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[which could in turn prompt others in the
region to do the same]{.underline}**.

## UQ

### UQ---AT: Iran Say No---2NC

#### Iran says yes---diplomatic pressure and fear of sanctions

**McGurk 25**, CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national
security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald
Trump and Joe Biden. (Brett McGurk, 7-7-2025, "Post-Iran crisis: A full
agenda for Trump and Netanyahu"

wtk

Iran nuclear program

**[Even as the assessments are ongoing about the extent of damage to
Iran's nuclear program, [a long-term solution will demand]{.mark} some
form of [a diplomatic arrangement.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This is primarily for two reasons:

First, **[as a member of the]{.underline}** Non-Proliferation Treaty, or
**[NPT]{.underline}**, **[Iran has an obligation to account for and
"safeguard" all its nuclear material]{.underline}**. That includes the
stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that may or may not be buried in
the caverns of the bombed Fordow facility.

While **[[Iran]{.mark}'s]{.underline}** parliament has passed a law to
sever ties with the International Atomic Energy Agency, its
**[government [has made clear it remains a member of the
NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}** and will continue to deal with the
international agency through its Supreme Council for National Security,
a rough equivalent to the National Security Council in the US.

**[[Should Iran refuse such cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then
**[[France and the UK have authority to "snap back"]{.mark} all UN and
international [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}** between now and October.
**[[That is something Iran's fledgling economy cannot
afford]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Second, **[[if Iran wants to avoid]{.underline}]{.mark}** the risk of
**[[further]{.underline}]{.mark}** Israeli or American
[**[strikes]{.underline}**, **[it will need to reach an
agreement]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[on whatever remains of its
enrichment program]{.underline}**. Before Israel's 12-day conflict with
Iran, the US was prepared to accept enrichment by Tehran below 5% and
aboveground pending the establishment of a regional fuel bank consortium
where Iran would be a member with access to nuclear fuel for a civilian
program, but unable to enrich entirely on its own.

Iran did not accept that deal, and today the terms will surely be less
favorable: no enrichment even for a temporary period or else face the
risk of further strikes and international sanctions.

[**[Despite predictions that American strikes would render diplomacy
impossible]{.underline}**, **[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark} in fact
**[[is]{.mark} saying it's [prepared to engage the American side once
again]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[[I'd expect those talks to start
soon]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Given Iran's leadership losses, it may have a difficult time reaching
decisions that will be necessary to forge an agreement of any kind. With
the threat of the snapback procedure, however, which I've explained in
this earlier essay, **[[the table is being set for negotiations]{.mark}
with a deadline later this year]{.underline}**.

**[The aim between now and then will be deal that permanently forecloses
the possibility of Iran developing nuclear arms.]{.underline}**

#### Squo mistrust can be overcome

Torbati, 7-13-2025, "Iran sees chance for nuclear deal with U.S. even
after attacks"

wtk

**[A [consensus is emerging within Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}**'s
fractious political scene **[[that the country must relaunch
negotiations over its nuclear program]{.mark} with the United
States]{.underline}**, **[[even as mistrust
remains]{.underline}]{.mark}** over whether such talks could simply be
the prelude to another Israeli attack, according to analysts and
political observers inside and outside Iran.

**[[Iranian President]{.underline}]{.mark}** Masoud Pezeshkian **[[and
Foreign Minister]{.underline}]{.mark}** Abbas Araghchi have **[[engaged
in a media blitz]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the past several weeks
seeking to distinguish between the U.S. and Israel,
**[[stressing]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[a negotiated
settlement]{.mark} could be reached with Washington]{.underline}**
despite Israeli hostility.

In an interview with conservative media personality Tucker Carlson
published last week, for instance, Pezeshkian accused Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of planting the idea in American minds that
Iran was after a nuclear weapon but emphasized that his country could
"very much easily resolve our differences and conflicts with the United
States through dialogue and talks." And in an opinion piece in the
Financial Times, Araghchi said **[Iran and the U.S. "were on the cusp of
a historic breakthrough]{.underline}**" before the Israeli strikes
began.

Some observers say **[[the momentum toward resuming negotiations
reflects a power struggle in Tehran that]{.mark} has [intensified
after]{.mark}]{.underline}** the Israeli and American
**[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** last month, **[with those advocating
a more conciliatory approach gaining influence]{.underline}** at the
expense of those favoring confrontation.

Still, there are dissenters. Hadi Masoumi Zare, a regional expert who
has appeared in the past on an outlet affiliated with Iran's
Revolutionary Guard Corps, acknowledged the ongoing struggle and
criticized efforts of policymakers who he said are exploiting the blows
dealt by Israel to push for talks with the U.S.

In a podcast episode released last week, Masoumi Zare said, "Today, in
the absence of many of these commanders, and with the feeling that this
ideological and revolutionary layer has been weakened and eroded by
Israel, they are trying to sell themselves and their mental model as the
savior to the Iranian people." He said this campaign was part of a
broader effort to dominate Iran's power centers.

For Iran's top officials, a sustained attack like the one Israel carried
out on its territory last month, paired with the U.S. bombing of three
nuclear facilities, was once an unthinkable proposition.

But those dramatic attacks have not produced a significant change in
Iran's public positions. Iran has signaled neither a greater interest in
pursuing a nuclear weapon nor any willingness to give up its nuclear
program. It still insists on the right to produce nuclear fuel within
its borders while repeating that it is not considering the development
of a nuclear weapon. Perhaps most striking, the U.S. **[[strikes have
not prompted Iran to turn away from Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"I would expect, after all that happened and the war and so on, to hear
sort of a unanimous position rejecting any engagement with the United
States. ... But, actually, it seems that the opposite is happening,"
said Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at the German Institute for
International and Security Affairs. He added, "**[The key here is the
vulnerabilities being on full display, and that resulting in some sort
of pragmatic approach]{.underline}**."

**[[The Iranian foreign minister said the two sides were 48 hours from a
pivotal sixth meeting]{.underline}]{.mark}** when Israel launched
airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and ballistic missiles
on June 13.

Israeli officials said the preemptive attack was necessary to eliminate
the "existential threat" posed by the Islamic Republic, which openly
calls to destroy the Jewish state. The air war between Iran and Israel
lasted 12 days, during which Trump ordered US bombers to pound Iranian
underground nuclear facilities.

**[[Araghchi acknowledged having received messages indicating Washington
may be ready to return to negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He noted
the US was one of six countries to sign a comprehensive nuclear deal
with Iran in 2015, only to withdraw in 2018 under the first Trump
presidency.

"**[[Iran remains interested in diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** but we
have good reason to have doubts about further dialogue. **[If there is a
desire to resolve this amicably, the US should show genuine readiness

Later Tuesday, Araghchi met with his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin
Farhan al-Saud in Mecca to discuss bilateral ties and the latest
developments in the region, according to the Saudi state news agency
SPA.

It was Araghchi's first visit to the Gulf kingdom, a longtime regional
rival since Iran and Israel concluded their 12-day air war.

Araghchi also held "fruitful" conversations with Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman and Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, the Iranian
foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said in a later post on X,
without clarifying where the talks were held.

'Opportunities for peace' with Iran

During a White House meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Monday night, Trump told reporters: "We have scheduled Iran talks, and
they... want to talk." Witkoff said the meeting would take place in the
next week or so.

Netanyahu appeared to be open to the prospect of renewed negotiations
between Iran and the US in a statement following his Tuesday meeting
with US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.

"[**[There are opportunities for peace that we intend to
realize]{.underline}**... **[We're working
together]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[on this]{.underline}**," he said.

#### State Department and White House are combining resources to strike deal with Iran

**Cohen et al, 6/26**/25, CNN senior reporter (Zachary, Alayna Treene,
Kylie Atwood, Jennifer Hansler, "Exclusive: Details emerge of secret
diplomatic efforts to restart Iran talks", CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/politics/us-iran-talks-nuclear-program)
//GB

The **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration **[[has
discussed]{.mark} possibly [helping Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}** access
as much as \$30 billion to [**[build]{.underline}**
**[a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[civilian-energy-producing [nuclear
program, easing sanctions, and freeing]{.mark} up billions of dollars in
[restricted]{.mark} Iranian [funds]{.mark} -- [all part of an]{.mark}
intensifying [attempt to bring Tehran back to the negotiating
table]{.mark},]{.underline}** four sources familiar with the matter
said.

**[[Key players from the US]{.mark} and the Middle East [have talked
with]{.mark} the [Iran]{.mark}ians]{.underline}** behind the scenes even
amid the flurry of military strikes in Iran and Israel over the past two
weeks, the sources said. Those **[[discussions have continued]{.mark}
this week [after]{.mark} a [ceasefire]{.mark} deal was
struck]{.underline}**, the sources said.

Trump administration officials emphasized that **[several proposals have
been floated]{.underline}**. They are preliminary and evolving with one
consistent non-negotiable: zero Iranian enrichment of uranium, which
Iran has consistently said it needs. But at least one preliminary draft
proposal, described to CNN by two sources, includes several incentives
for Iran.

Some **[[details were hashed out in a]{.underline}]{.mark}** secret,
hours-long **[[meeting between US]{.mark} special envoy Steve Witkoff
[and]{.mark} [Gulf partners at the White House]{.mark}]{.underline}**
last Friday, the day before US military strikes against Iran, two
sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

Among the terms being discussed, which have not been previously
reported, is an estimated \$20-30 billion investment in a new Iranian
non-enrichment nuclear program that would be used for civilian energy
purposes, Trump administration officials and sources familiar with the
proposal told CNN. One official insisted that money would not come
directly from the US, which prefers its Arab partners foot the bill.
Investment in Iran's nuclear energy facilities has been discussed in
previous rounds of nuclear talks in recent months.

**["[The US is willing to lead]{.mark} these [talks"]{.mark} with
Iran]{.underline}**, the Trump administration official told CNN. "And
someone is going to need to pay for the nuclear program to be built, but
we will not make that commitment."

Other incentives include potentially removing some sanctions on Iran and
allowing Tehran to access the \$6 billion currently sitting in foreign
bank accounts that it is restricted from freely using, according to the
draft described to CNN.

Another idea floated last week that is currently being considered is for
US-backed allies in the Gulf to pay to replace the Fordow nuclear
facility -- which the US hit with bunker-buster bombs over the weekend
-- with the non-enrichment program, two sources familiar with the matter
said. It was not immediately clear if Iran would be able to use the site
itself, nor was it clear how seriously that proposal was being
considered.

"There are a lot of ideas being thrown around by different people and a
lot of them are trying to be creative," one of the sources familiar with
the discussions told CNN.

"I think it is entirely uncertain what will happen here," said a
separate source familiar with the first five rounds of talks between the
US and Iran that occurred before the Israeli and US strikes on Iran's
nuclear program.

Witkoff told CNBC Wednesday that **[the [US is seeking a "comprehensive
peace agreement]{.mark},"]{.underline}** and a Trump administration
official emphasized that all of the proposals are designed to stop Iran
from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

#### State Department is working specifically toward diplomatic talks toward Iran 

**Ferris, 6/27**/25, CNN reporter (Sarah, Lauren Fox, Annie Grayer, Manu
Raju, "Rubio says he wants 'one-on-one' talks with Iran -- but some in
Congress remain skeptical",
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/27/politics/iran-diplomacy-senate-briefing)
//GB

Six days after US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, **[[top White
House officials]{.mark} told House lawmakers they [are]{.mark} now
[focused on drawing Tehran back to
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- though members of both parties
said the precise strategy to do so was not clear.

"One of the things that was discussed this morning is that
**[[we]{.mark} now [need Iran to engage]{.mark} with us [in
direct]{.mark} good-faith talks, [negotiations]{.mark}, not through
third parties, not through other countries, they need to sit down at the
table with us]{.underline}**," Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters
Friday after an all-member classified briefing.

**[That [message]{.mark} on diplomacy [was delivered by Secretary of
State]{.mark} Marco [Rubio,]{.mark} [who]{.mark} told lawmakers that he
[wanted to meet "one-on-one" with Iranian
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}** and not through a "third party,"
according to another senior Republican, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas.

But the former Foreign Affairs Committee chairman was one of multiple
House lawmakers who told CNN he was personally "skeptical" of the plan:
"I'm clear eyed about the Ayatollah. I love this 'give peace a chance'
thing, and let's try. You have to try the negotiations. So we'll do it
for what, a month? Then they're gonna go underground."

President Donald Trump's next steps on diplomacy with Iran, however,
were not made clear, multiple lawmakers said. Rep. Jim Himes, the top
Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said no one from the
administration suggested "there were any overtures or discussions
happening right now" on the diplomatic front.

#### The trump administration is making negotiations with Iran now.

of]{.underline}** a broader **[diplomatic push to reengage Tehran in

citing multiple sources familiar with the talks.

The reported **[[discussions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which **[[include
easing sanctions and unfreezing restricted Iranian
funds]{.underline}]{.mark}**, come amid ongoing efforts by Washington to
reestablish indirect communication with Iran following a volatile
two-week period marked by military strikes involving Israel, the US, and
Iran.

Central to the American proposal is a non-negotiable condition: Iran
must agree to cease all uranium enrichment. While Iran has repeatedly
asserted its need to enrich uranium for peaceful energy purposes,
**[Washington]{.underline}** has **[floated the idea of Tehran importing
enriched uranium]{.underline}**---similar to the model employed by the
United Arab Emirates.

Funding isn\'t from US, officials reportedly urging Arab Gulf states to
cover the cost

According to the CNN report, a preliminary draft proposal being
circulated among US officials includes up to \$30 billion in investment
for a new, non-enrichment nuclear program that would generate civilian
energy. While the funding would not come directly from the United
States, administration **[[officials are]{.mark} reportedly [urging Arab
Gulf states to shoulder]{.mark} the [cost]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

REUTERS, e)Some of the terms were discussed during a closed-door meeting
last Friday at the White House, led by US special envoy Steve Witkoff
and attended by representatives from key Gulf states. The meeting took
place one day before the US launched military strikes targeting Iranian
nuclear infrastructure.

**[[Incentives]{.underline}]{.mark}** being **[[considered
include]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[partial lifting of sanctions and
unlocking approximately \$6 billion in Iranian assets]{.mark} currently
held in foreign bank accounts[. Another option]{.mark}]{.underline}**
under review involves **[[replacing the recently bombed Fordow facility
with a non-enrichment nuclear site]{.underline}]{.mark}**, funded by
US-aligned Gulf partners. It remains unclear whether Iran would be
allowed to use the restructured site.

Witkoff has stated that **[[the]{.mark} US is seeking a "comprehensive
peace agreement" with Iran]{.underline}**, while officials emphasized
that all proposals are designed to prevent Tehran from acquiring a
nuclear weapon.

The proposals are still in early stages and subject to change. However,
the diplomatic push has continued in recent days, with Qatar playing a
prominent mediating role. Doha was instrumental in securing the
ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran earlier this week and is
expected to remain involved in efforts to prevent further escalation.

Prior to the outbreak of hostilities, the US and Iran had completed five
rounds of indirect negotiations aimed at establishing a framework for a
new nuclear agreement. A sixth round, planned to take place in Oman, was
derailed by the Israeli strikes on Iranian sites.

#### Trump said he still wants to meet with Iran to discuss sanctions relief and other negotiations.

\] EK

**[The [Trump administration]{.mark}]{.underline}** in recent days has
**[[explored]{.underline}]{.mark}** possible **[[economic incentives for
Iran]{.mark} in return for]{.underline}** the **[regime halting uranium
enrichment, [including releasing billions of dollars in frozen Iranian
assets]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to three sources familiar with
the discussions.

**[The]{.underline}** tentative **[[proposal]{.mark}
[would]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[allow]{.mark} [Iran to receive
assistance from regional countries]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [enable Tehran to
build]{.mark}]{.underline}** a **[[civilian nuclear
program]{.mark},]{.underline}** granting Tehran access to as much as
\$30 billion.

**[The proposal is one of many]{.underline}** ideas under consideration
by the administration, the sources said. The details of the
administration's discussions were first reported by CNN.

The potential deal would mark a major reversal in policy for President
Donald Trump, who pulled the U.S. out of the Obama administration's
nuclear deal with Iran in 2018, arguing in part that the sanctions
relief and unfreezing of Iranian assets had provided a "lifeline of
cash" to the Iranian regime to continue its malign activities.

Still, it is not immediately clear if the financial proposal or any
negotiations between the U.S. and Iran will move forward.

In a Truth Social post Friday night, Trump said he "never heard of this
ridiculous idea," adding that it was "just another HOAX put out by the
Fake News."01:14

Earlier Friday, Trump threatened to drop any possible sanctions relief
for Iran after the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
declared victory in the war with Israel and downplayed the significance
of U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites.

"Why would the so-called 'Supreme Leader,' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, of
the war torn Country of Iran, say so blatantly and foolishly that he won
the War with Israel, when he knows his statement is a lie?" **[[Trump
wrote]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a lengthy post on Truth Social, adding:
"During the last few days, **[[I was working on]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** possible **[[removal of sanctions]{.mark}, [and other
things]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which would have given a much better
chance **[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** Iran at a full, fast, and
**[[complete recovery]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- The sanctions are
BITING! But no, instead I get hit with a statement of anger, hatred, and
disgust."

In a prerecorded speech on Iranian state TV on Thursday, Khamenei said:
"The Islamic Republic was victorious and in retaliation delivered a hand
slap to America's face."

He added: "This action can be repeated in the future."

But later on Friday, **[[Trump insisted]{.mark} the [Iranians still
want]{.mark}]{.underline}**ed **[[to meet]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
him **[[to discuss possible sanctions relief]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"They do want to meet me, and we'll do that quickly. **[We're going to
do it]{.underline}** quickly," **[Trump told reporters]{.underline}**
during a White House meeting with the foreign ministers of Rwanda and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

"Don't you think we have sanctions on there that they can't do anything?
Wouldn't you think that they want to meet me? I mean, they're not stupid
people."

### UQ---AT: State Department Cuts---2NC

#### State Department is becoming more efficient and adequately staffed despite layoffs.

**Katz and DiMolfetta 25** -- Senior correspondent at Government
Executive and cybersecurity reporter for FCW (Eric Katz and David
DiMolfetta, 5-29-2025, "Here\'s where the State Department is planning
its layoffs and changes", Government Executive,
https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/05/Heres-where-the-state-department-planning-layoffs-and-changes/405681/
) // EW

The State Department is moving forward with a plan to eliminate or
consolidate more than 300 of its offices and bureaus, according to
documents provided to lawmakers and employees on Thursday, leading to
**[a [reduction]{.mark} of more than 3,400 employees and 45% of its
structural entities.]{.underline}**

The changes, outlined in the multiple documents obtained by Government
Executive and Nextgov/FCW, **[[will address]{.mark} "bureaucratic
[overgrowth]{.mark}"]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark} streamline functions
with [overlapping]{.mark} [responsibilities]{.mark}, the department
said, though some significant reforms to bureau missions are also
included in the reorganization.]{.underline}** The plans presented
Thursday offer more detail than those first laid out by State Secretary
Marco Rubio in April, though the number of employee reductions was first
reported by Government Executive earlier this month.

**[While [State]{.mark} is eliminating a slew of offices across the
department]{.underline}**, **[it [is reassigning]{.mark} much of the
[impacted functions]{.mark} elsewhere]{.underline}**. The workforce cuts
are from a baseline of staffing levels as of May 4, meaning any
attrition that occurred prior to that date will not count toward the
goal.

The layoffs will exempt passport and visa operations with Consular
Affairs, as well as special agents in active law enforcement cases and
regional staff assigned to a specific country desk. The cuts will only
impact domestic staff, though both civil and foreign service personnel
will be laid off, according to the documents.

"RIF plans have been carefully tailored, consistent with applicable law,
to preserve core functions," State said in a document prepared for
Capitol Hill. "Reductions will principally affect non-core functions,
duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable
efficiencies may be found from centralization or consolidation of
functions and responsibilities."

This is where State's cuts will take place, by division:

The Economic Growth, Energy and Environment division, or the "E Family,"
plans to RIF 198 employees and another 99 are leaving voluntarily. That
will lead to a reduction of 42% of that team.

The Foreign Assistance and Humanitarian Affairs division, or "F/J
Family," plans to RIF 386 employees and see another 145 depart
voluntarily. That division will be slashed by 69%.

The Management division, or "M Family," plans to lay off 897 employees
and let another 796 leave through deferred resignations. That will lead
to a cut of around 15% of staff.

The Political Affairs division, or "P Family," plans to RIF 112
employees and shed another 162 through resignations. That will amount to
cuts of about 14%.

The Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, or "R Family," plans to lay off
88 employees and see another 80 leave voluntarily. That amounts to a cut
of about 22%.

The State Secretary Marco Rubio's office, or "S Family," will lay off
just 51 employees and another 189 have signed up to resign. About 12% of
the office will be cut.

The Arms Control and International Security division, or "T Family,"
plans to RIF 141 employees and allow another 104 to leave voluntarily.
That will lead to a reduction of about 22% of that team.

State plans to complete its implementation of the reorganization by July
1 and, as it makes changes, it will "communicate them to the workforce,"
the department said in a "frequently asked questions" document. It has
already incorporated feedback from both the workforce and Congress, the
department said.

It reminded staff that their office disappearing from the organizational
chart does not necessarily mean they will be laid off. Some employees
will simply be reassigned. The department asked employees to ensure
their personal contact information is up to date.

**[While foreign service officers will be impacted by the
layoffs]{.underline}**, **[the department said its]{.underline}**
**[[human resources]{.mark} team [will work with]{.mark}
[personnel]{.mark} whose next assignments have been eliminated [to find
new roles]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

It was not immediately clear how the decision to proceed with the
reorganization plan---and to send out RIF notices by July 1---will
comply with a court-ordered injunction pausing State and 19 other
agencies from carrying out those changes. A State spokesperson said the
department could not comment on ongoing litigation.

New structures

State will eliminate many of the offices in its Civilian Security, Human
Rights and Democracy division, which the department said had become
"prone to ideological capture and radicalism."

Offices such as Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) and Population,
Refugees and Migration (PRM) will now fall under the undersecretary for
Foreign Assistance and Humanitarian Affairs.

DRL will take on a "leaner" portfolio, State said, that will reflect the
administration's "values-based diplomacy \[based\] in traditional
Western conceptions of core freedoms." One foreign service officer
familiar with the office called the reprioritization a "substantial"
change to the office's mission. The overall division handling
humanitarian and foreign assistance, that employee said, will be
"completely decimated."

A new Office of Security Affairs will be stood up inside the Bureau of
International Organization Affairs---which develops U.S. policy with the
United Nations---that would merge the bureau's coverage of UN
peacekeeping operations, sanctions and counterterrorism, one memo said.

That same memo detailed multiple other office consolidations. The
European and Eurasian Affairs unit, for instance, will merge Russian and
Caucus nations' coverage into a new Office of Russian Affairs and the
Caucuses, it says. And in the South and Central Asian Affairs office,
the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts and the Special
Representative for Afghan Reconstruction will be shuttered, that memo
added. Their functions are expected to be moved into the Afghanistan
Affairs Office.

**[A major [restructuring]{.mark} of the Under Secretary for Arms
Control and International Security]{.underline}** family
"**[[consolidates]{.mark} nearly all of [the Department's]{.mark}
security-oriented [programs]{.mark} [into a new vertical]{.mark}
[focused on]{.mark} addressing contemporary [security and military
challenges]{.mark},]{.underline}**" the readout also said.

#### Layoffs are improving government efficiency now.

**Katz 25** \-- Senior correspondent at Government Executive (Eric Katz,
5-20-2025, "Staffing cuts will improve government services, agency
leaders say", Government Executive,
https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/05/staffing-cuts-will-improve-government-services-agency-leaders-say/405471/
) // EW

Agency leaders across the Trump administration on Tuesday told lawmakers
their **[[efforts to slash]{.mark} their [rolls]{.mark} would [lead to
improved]{.mark} [experiences for those interacting]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} their federal [offices]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[despite]{.mark} some bipartisan [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}**
over the impacts of those cuts.

The officials promised to protect or increase staff in certain areas and
said they would move staff around to streamline operations. The Trump
administration has pushed out tens of thousands of employees through
incentivized departures and is in the midst of laying off far more
staff.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin told a panel of
the House Appropriations Committee that **[[despite]{.mark} ongoing
staff [cuts]{.mark}, [the agency]{.mark} [would meet all]{.mark} of
[its]{.mark} statutory [obligations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** EPA is
planning significant layoffs and earlier this month announced a
restructuring of its offices.

The administrator said **[reassigning employees from the Office of
Research and Development will allow the agency to cut through backlogs
in]{.underline}** **[programmatic offices]{.underline}**. Thousands of
pesticides are pending approval, Zeldin cited as an example, and
**[boosting the scientific workforce]{.underline}** in the pesticide
office will move that process along more quickly.

### L---Generic/Arctic Trades Off---2NC 

#### Expanding presence in the arctic trades off with other global initiatives

department of the U.S. federal government; 6-21-2024; Department of

Accessed 6-28-2025; VB\]

This strategy lays out the Department of Defense's (DoD's) approach to
the Arctic as the region undergoes rapid geophysical and geopolitical
change.1 The strategy aligns with and nests under the 2022 National
Security Strategy (NSS), 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), and 2022
National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR). It also aligns with and
implements the intent of the 2023 DoD Homeland Defense Policy Guidance.

**[The NSAR states that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [seeks an
Arctic]{.mark} region [that is peaceful]{.mark}, stable, prosperous,
[and cooperative]{.mark}. In support of this national-level objective,
DoD, in cooperation [with]{.mark} our [Allies]{.mark} and partners2 ,
will pursue an end state that preserves the Arctic as a stable region in
which the U.S. homeland remains secure and vital national interests are
safeguarded.]{.underline}**

**[The NDS directs that [activities in the Arctic]{.mark} will be
calibrated to reflect a "monitor-and-respond" approach that is
[underpinned by robust intelligence collection]{.mark} capabilities,
[security cooperation]{.mark} with our regional Allies and partners,
[and]{.mark} the deterrent value of DoD's ability to deploy the Joint
Force globally at the time and place of our choosing.]{.underline}**
This strategy guides DoD's efforts to build and sustain this
monitor-and-respond approach to the Arctic. Implementing this strategy
will enable DoD to achieve our desired end state for the region,
aligning with efforts to strengthen homeland defense, safeguard U.S.
interests, and improve interoperability with Arctic Allies and partners
while preserving focus on the pacing challenge of the People's Republic
of China (PRC) globally.

Climate change and shifts in the geostrategic environment drive the need
for a new strategic approach to the Arctic region. **[This strategy will
strengthen the ability of the United States to build integrated
deterrence and effectively manage risk to U.S. interests in the Arctic
region by [enhancing]{.mark} our [domain awareness]{.mark} and Arctic
capabilities; engaging with Allies, partners, and key stakeholders; and
exercising tailored presence.]{.underline}**

**[[Primary risks to]{.mark} the [success]{.mark} of this strategy [stem
from the need to balance against other]{.mark} DoD [global
commitments]{.mark} or find ways to integrate with other resource
requirements. As such, DoD Components should take these risks into
account during resourcing deliberations through DoD's established
processes.]{.underline}**

Introduction: Broader Background for U.S. Arctic Policy

The United States' strategic position near Russia and neighboring Canada
allows the U.S. access to the Beaufort Sea, the Chukchi Sea, and the
Bering Sea and requires the United States to manage a lengthy maritime
border with Russia that extends through the Bering Strait and Chukchi
Sea into the Arctic Ocean as far as permitted under international law.
**[The [U.S. gov]{.mark}ernment has [articulated]{.mark} its
[fundamental interest in the Arctic]{.mark} for more than 40 years in a
series of government strategies:]{.underline}** beginning with President
Nixon's 1971 National Security Decision Memorandum (NSDM-144), to Ronald
Reagan's 1983 National Security Decision Directive (NSDD-90), to
President George W. Bush's National Security Presidential Directive 66
and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 25, signed in 2009, and the
2016 Report to Congress from the Department of Defense on Strategy to
Protect United States National Security Interests in the Arctic Region.1
Each document established broad guidelines for U.S. policy in the region
that aligned with the geostrategic realities at the time.2

Today, there are **[three [major drivers]{.mark}]{.underline}** that are
**[[shaping the Arctic]{.mark}:]{.underline}**

**[Geopolitical drivers of [great power competition
with]{.mark}]{.underline}** the largest Arctic coastal state
[**[Russia]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} a
self-proclaimed "near Arctic state," **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**;

**[[Environmental drivers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which are
simultaneously **[transforming the Arctic maritime and terrestrial
space]{.underline}** at rates that confound scientists while fueling the
development of flexible governance structures; and,

**[[Economic drivers]{.mark} that are highly correlated [with global
commodity prices]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

U.S. policy toward the Arctic is **[driven by these factors as well as
Alaska's important domestic economic role providing vital energy,
mineral, and fishery resources.]{.underline}** The Alaskan North Slope
contains some of the country's largest oils fields and natural gas
fields; the 2016 value of its mineral industry was \$2.83 billion3; and
fisherman landed \$5.4 billion of fish and shellfish in 2017.4 Alaska's
economic activity has been subdued for the past several years due to
lower global energy prices. The state must respond to increased coastal
erosion necessitating village relocation, permafrost thaw, and fresh
water scarcity which is dramatically altering traditional livelihoods.

The **[[challenge for]{.mark} an overarching [U.S. Arctic policy
is]{.mark} that [it must address all of these cross-cutting]{.mark}
[issues simultaneously: protect]{.mark} the [homeland, pursue
environmental adaptation]{.mark} and resilience, [and address]{.mark}
global [economic and security dynamics]{.mark} while engaging in
anticipatory policymaking]{.underline}**. U.S. government strategies and
documents for the Arctic are largely descriptive in nature, and they
have **[yet to [alter resource allocations]{.mark} (with the exception
of recent congressional funding for one heavy-icebreaker, which will be
predominantly used in Antarctica)]{.underline}** or establish new
organizational structures that can more efficiently address these
cross-cutting issues. They also do not offer a clear set of priorities.

### L---Greenland---2NC

#### U.S. is prioritizing other national security concerns ahead of Greenland

**Rein, et. al, 25** (April 1, 2025, Lisa Rein, Michael Birnbaum,
Natalie Allison and Jeff Stein, "White House studying cost of Greenland
takeover, long in Trump's sights; It's the most concrete effort yet to
turn President Donald Trump's desire to acquire the Danish territory
into actionable policy, despite widespread international outrage,"
https://archive.ph/8EfqA, JMP))

**[[Trump has eyed]{.mark} control of [Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}**
as a strategic win for the United States, both because of its mineral
resources and also because of its strategic location. Poised at a
crucial chokepoint between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, it is near
sea lanes that are important for shipping and also military travel,
including the submarines that are a crucial way for countries that
possess nuclear weapons to project their power.

**[[But it's still not]{.mark} at [the top]{.mark} of the list of
national security [issue]{.mark}s]{.underline}**, the **[[White House
official]{.underline}]{.mark}** cautioned, [**[describing the
acquisition of Greenland as a "bonus play" to come]{.underline}**
**[after]{.underline}** **[ending the war]{.underline}** **[between
Russia and Ukraine, securing peace in Israel and Gaza and deterring
Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- all agenda items for this year.

#### Trump is not investing significant resources into a deal with Greenland so he can focus on other foreign policy priorities 

**Jacobsen, 25** - Associate Professor at the Royal Danish Defence
College's Centre for Arctic Security Studies where he researches
security politics and diplomacy in the Arctic (April 10, 2025, Marc
Jacobsen, "Is the White House calculating the Cost of taking over
Greenland?"
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/white-house-calculating-cost-taking-over-greenland/,
JMP))

The Washington Post (WP) recently wrote that the White House is
calculating the potential cost of taking over Greenland. If one believes
the reputable newspaper, we are witnessing Donald Trump's most concrete
effort to follow words by actions with regards to Greenland.

President Trump actually means it. That, we have realized. At the same
time, the news article indicates that a military annexation is not the
most immediate move, but that the U.S. will use soft power and economic
incitements to seduce Greenland.

Three special points of interest in WP's article

If we take a closer look at WP's article, there are three points we
should pay extra attention to.

First, it is worth noticing that **[at least [three issues rank higher
than Greenland on Trump's]{.mark} security political to-do
[list]{.mark}]{.underline}** for 2025: 1) A peace agreement between
Russia and **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, 2) **[A peace agreement
between [Israel]{.mark} and Hammas]{.underline}**, 3) **[Increased
deterrence of [Iran]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[**[The strive for fulfilling those ambitions will take
up]{.underline}** **[enormous resources]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[so in
that light [it makes sense when a source characterizes Greenland as "a
bonus play"]{.mark}]{.underline}** further down the list. In other
words: **[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}** does **[[occupy a great deal
of the communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- where symbolic visits and
extreme utterances attract international attention -- **[[but we should
not expect big substantial initiatives right
away]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### L---Border Settlement---2NC

#### Diplomacy is required to settle border disputes between powers in the Arctic

**Brimmer '23** \[Esther D. Brimmer; James H. Binger senior fellow in

**[[Increased activity by China and Russia]{.mark} in the Arctic [is a
manifestation of]{.mark}]{.underline}** another trend: **[[great power
competition in global spaces]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For over a century
**[the United States has enjoyed command of the seas and more recently
airspace and outer space.]{.underline}** Access to sea routes, airwaves,
cyberspace, and satellite information are all necessary for modern
economies to function, but also require using shared international
spaces that may be beyond or at the edges of national jurisdiction. In
many parts of the **[world great power and assertive middle powers [seek
access to resources]{.mark}, some of which may be [in]{.mark} or under
these [global spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Access to the global
commons and areas beyond national jurisdiction is crucial for success in
an era of strategic and commercial rivalry. Therefore, protection of
coastlines, waterways, safe commercial transit, and management of marine
resources place extra demands on the United States Coast Guard.

**[Oceans are especially sensitive]{.underline}**. At the **[center of
the Arctic region is [the Arctic Ocean]{.mark}, which [is beyond the
jurisdiction of any country]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea creates the international legal regime
for oceans, including the Arctic Ocean. **[Each Arctic country,
including the U.S., claims its 200- mile exclusive
economic]{.underline}** zone. The U.S. is at a disadvantage because it
is not a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
which provides mechanisms for countries to claim more rights.
**[[Canada, Russia, and Denmark]{.mark} (on behalf of Greenland) [turned
to]{.mark} one of those mechanisms, [the]{.mark} United Nations
Commission on the Limit of the Continental Shelf ([CLCS]{.mark})
[regarding]{.mark} their [overlapping claims]{.mark} to the Lomonosov
Ridge [under the Arctic Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The CLCS made
non-binding recommendations in February 2023 about the extent of
Russia's claim. **[[Further diplomatic or legal work will need to occur
to settle the borders]{.underline}]{.mark}**.xvi The Arctic, like other
regions of the world, benefits from layers of global governance. Even in
an era of geopolitical upheaval, cooperation on technical standards
facilitates commercial, social, and environmental interactions. The
International Maritime Organization's International Code for Ships
Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code), which entered into force in
2017, provides important standards for shippers operating in the Arctic
and Antarctic regions. The terms of the Polar Code are mandatory under
both the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)
and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships (MARPOL).xvii

Fundamental to understanding the geopolitical and economic issues in the
Arctic is the phenomenon of climate change. **[Global warming is
occurring in the Arctic possibly three times as fast as in the rest of
the world.]{.underline}**xviii Sea ice is frozen seawater. With less
Arctic sea ice to reflect sunshine away from the Earth, the planet will
continue to heat up. Furthermore, the Greenland ice sheet (which is
frozen freshwater) has lost ice for the past twenty-five years.

The ongoing **[[geopolitical shifts]{.mark} occurring before the
invasion of Ukraine [were premised on climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Climate change is important to the
geopolitics of the Arctic **[because it changes access to the
oceans]{.underline}**. The warming climate means that **[more [areas of
the Arctic are ice-free]{.mark} in the summer, possibly [opening
opportunities for navigation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There could be
ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean in the 2030s. Companies and
countries watch to see if navigation through the Arctic would be viable,
thereby shortening shipping routes and times between Asia and Europe.
Other observers counter that even with less ice, Arctic navigation would
still be difficult.

Climate change challenges livelihoods. Around 4 million people live in
the Arctic, and about 2 million of them are Russian; about 500,000 are
Indigenous people. Around sixty percent of Alaska Native communities are
"environmentally threatened" by climate change. **[Conditions are
especially acute for Indigenous people who still hunt for
sustenance]{.underline}**. Thin ice and altered animal migrations mean
hunters must travel farther for food. Migration patterns of birds and
fish, and also caribou, walruses, and whales have shifted, requiring
people to extend the hunting season. Warmer waters may entice fish
usually found in lower latitudes to move farther north. **[The changing
climate also affects companies' calculations]{.underline}**. Shell ended
offshore exploration in Alaska in 2015. The Biden Administration's
October 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region includes
investments in the Arctic. **[[To advance maritime security in an era of
strategic competition]{.mark} in the Arctic, [the United States
must]{.mark} continue to [deepen its commitment]{.mark}
to]{.underline}**

- Make progress on building a deep-water port in Nome, Alaska.

- Continue the Polar Security Cutter program.

- Work with the current chair of the Arctic Council, Norway, to sustain
  mechanisms that promote human and environmental well-being, including
  connections among Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic region.

### L---Diplomacy/Tensions---2NC

#### Resolving Arctic tension requires diplomatic capital to achieve.

Corporation; previously known as the Voice of Canada; "U.S. wants to

accessed 07-02-2025\] NT-LY

Speaking to reporters via teleconference call barely a week after his
appointment, James DeHart, struck an unusually cooperative tone even as
he portended that years from now the summer of 2020 will be seen as a
pivotal moment in the U.S. Arctic policy.

"Our **[[objectives for the region are that it be]{.mark} peaceful and
[an area of low tension, and]{.mark} that there be [close cooperation
among]{.mark} the [nations]{.mark} of the Arctic]{.underline}**," DeHart
**[[said]{.underline}]{.mark}** in his opening remarks.

"**[We want to see economic growth and development in a way that is
supportive of local communities, including the Indigenous communities of
the region, and in a way that is environmentally sustainable, that
respects principles of good governance and transparency]{.underline}**."
**[[James DeHart, U.S. Arctic coordinator]{.underline}]{.mark}**

DeHart's tone was in sharp contrast to the more assertive and at times
almost belligerent tone of his boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who
stunned observers during an Arctic policy speech in Finland last year by
tongue-lashing China and Russia and their policies in the Arctic.

**'An important pivot point'**

**[DeHart, a career diplomat with extensive experience in global defence
and security issues]{.underline}**, has stepped into a position that was
left vacant for nearly three years after retired U.S. Coast Guard
Admiral Robert Papp left office in early 2017.

His appointment should be seen in the context of several recent
diplomatic and defence moves by Washington to shore up its interests in
the Arctic, DeHart said.

Over the last couple of months, the **[[U.S. has launched a
comprehensive and integrated diplomatic approach]{.mark} and engagement
[in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, he added.

That includes the memorandum issued by the White House on June 9 that
has set in motion the development of a fleet of Arctic icebreakers by
2029, DeHart said.

The State Department has opened a U.S. consulate in Nuuk, Greenland,
DeHart said, **[adding that [it is a significant development given the
finite diplomatic resources at Washington's
disposal.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Pompeo visited Denmark less than two weeks ago, where the Arctic was an
important part of discussions with Danish officials, he said. Pompeo
also had a separate quadrilateral meeting that included ministers from
Greenland and the Faroe Islands in addition to U.S. and Danish
officials, DeHart said.

The U.S. Air Force also released its Arctic strategy in July, he added.

"In a few years people will look at this summer and see it as an
important pivot point, a turning point with a more sustained and
enduring attention by the United States to the Arctic region." James
DeHart

#### **Ensuring a stable arctic requires the US to expend diplomatic capital with allies**

The current administration's focus on the military and China aspects
within Arctic policy aside, the U.S. has additional interests and
responsibilities that its policy should address moving forward. As the
U.S. works to patch security weaknesses, it should address non-military
threats as well. The U.S. should reincorporate, for example, climate
resilience and Indigenous community development into its Arctic strategy
to ensure the wellbeing of local communities. [The [U.S. should]{.mark}
additionally [promote stability]{.mark} and a rules-based order **[by
investing in diplomatic capital and regional
partners]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In this vein, the reopening of the
consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, while most directly motivated by military
factors, could have the added benefit of [[deepening diplomatic
engagement]{.mark} with allies]{.underline} like Denmark.

U.S. policymakers should also [[ensure]{.mark} that [resources]{.mark}
and attention [are spent on anticipating]{.mark} all [threats]{.mark},
not just those posed by a specific strategic competitor like
China]{.underline}. Essential to this is qualifying the urgency of
threats posed by all Arctic actors independently. As U.S. Arctic policy
matures and sub-strategies develop, the Pentagon and Homeland Security
should issue recommendations with the unique interests and on-the-ground
capabilities of each strategic competitor in mind. [Russia is an Arctic
state with great Arctic assets and vested interests, and China poses
less traditional challenges to the region]{.underline}. China, for
example, only operates two icebreakers and has contracted the
construction of a nuclear-powered icebreaker. Considerations of Russia's
overwhelming icebreaking fleet versus China's smaller fleet can help
distinguish the threats posed by each country and illuminate where
additional resources are best allocated.

on]{.mark} [integration]{.mark} and leveraging the military strength and
[regional expertise of Arctic allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The
strategy [also calls engaging in dialogue with

\]

The 2024 Department of Defense (DoD) Arctic Strategy further recognizes
the Arctic's growing importance due to climate change, geopolitical
shifts, and increasing great-power competition and directs the DoD to
"**[enhance its Arctic capabilities, [deepen engagement with Allies and

[critical defense objectives, including]{.mark} protecting US
sovereignty, maintaining stability, and ensuring the Arctic's role as a
secure avenue for power projection]{.underline}**. The 2024 Strategy
includes specific initiatives such as **[[enhanced domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}**; increased communication, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; better understanding of
cold-weather operations; and conducting key routine training alongside
US allies to strengthen joint capabilities.14) **[The strategy
[emphasizes cooperation with, and participation of, Arctic
nations]{.mark} and Indigenous communities]{.underline}**. It
underscores climate adaptation measures. Through these efforts, the DoD
seeks to maintain a "monitor-and-respond" posture, ensuring the Arctic
remains peaceful while adapting to dynamic environmental and security
conditions.

#### Domain Awareness requires partnerships in order to be successful.

\]

The United States faces challenges in detecting and deterring all
threats to the homeland. **[Addressing vulnerabilities]{.underline}**,
particularly **[in [Arctic domain awareness]{.mark},]{.underline}**
**[[requires]{.mark} leveraging [other government
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[not just defense
capabilities]{.underline}** -- for enhanced data collection and
information sharing toward improved national defense.

**[[Interagency capabilities are force multipliers in homeland
defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For the preponderance of the 20th
century, DoD maintained operational
**[[partnerships]{.underline}]{.mark}** with non-defense agencies toward
defense aims. While many persist, some have eroded in the 21st century
-- and **[[need to be reinvigorated for better preparedness]{.mark} in
peacetime and effectiveness in wartime]{.underline}**. However, defense
partnerships should not require the prospect of conflict to motivate
action. Rather, **[[partnerships are vital mechanisms for building
cooperative designs]{.mark} during peacetime to leverage during
wartime.]{.underline}**

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is an
intelligence collector at its core. From delivering lifesaving weather
forecasts to ensuring uninterrupted commerce-critical port operations,
NOAA\'s scientists, instruments, and assets are instrumental in
information collection and dissemination. But unlike what many in DoD
think, NOAA is not just 'the weather people.' NOAA brings scientists and
operational experts in the air, land, space, and sea - **[making their
environmental intelligence critical for enhancing DoD domain awareness,
information dominance, and decision superiority.]{.underline}**

NOAA and DoD maintain research and data sharing partnerships in areas of
common interests. However, operational collaborations once routine in
the 20th century have all but stopped until recently. We have undertaken
an effort to reestablish operational coordination between NOAA and DoD,
with some success. Still, recent NOAA-DoD integration efforts toward
national security end up facing confusion, uncertainty, and
institutional reticence due to ad hoc coordination processes lacking
fidelity. **[[We must]{.mark} reestablish and [implement formal
collaboration mechanisms]{.mark} [to facilitate]{.mark} DoD-NOAA
operational coordination toward [defense aims]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
as they once existed.

[**Canada** will purchase a \$6.5bn radar system from Australia after it
overtook the **US** in negotiations to acquire the leading technology
first,]{.underline} under a deal that marks the biggest defence export
in the nation's history.

[Ottawa has agreed to **purchase** the Jindalee **Over-the-Horizon Radar
(**JORN) system to build its new Arctic radar system, as Canadian Prime
Minister Mark Carney seeks to bolster his country's defence capabilities
**amid** political **pressure from US** President Donald
Trump.]{.underline}

The move [follows Mr Trump's threats to annex his northern neighbour as
America's "51st state]{.underline}", [and his punishing
tariffs]{.underline} that have left Canada looking to strengthen ties
with other longstanding partners, including Australia, Britain and
Europe.

[Defence Minister Richard Marles on Wednesday said **discussions** were
still under way with the US to purchase JORN]{.underline}, spruiking the
system as among the "best technology in the world".

Defence Minister Richard Marles.

"We're [talking with the US, as we have been for some time]{.underline}
in relation to ... JORN, that has been developed in Australia," he said.

"It really is exquisite technology. But we are [very excited about the
prospect of working with Canad]{.underline}a, as has been announced by
Prime Minister Carney and has been discussed between Prime Minister
Carney and Prime Minister (Anthony) Albanese.

"There's a lot of water to go under the bridge here, but in
[**collaborating** with Canada in relation to this
technology]{.underline} and working closely with them, what is in
[prospect is the single biggest defence industry]{.underline} export
from Australia in our history.

"This is a really, really big opportunity for the nation."

Mr Carney announced the purchase overnight, declaring that Canada's
[Arctic **Over-the-Horizon Radar**]{.underline} system would "strengthen
Canada's Arctic security" by providing [early warning radar
coverage]{.underline} for threats from the north.

"[Canada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation]{.underline}, and we
can never take our sovereignty and security in the region for granted,"
he said.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has spoken with Canada's newly elected
Prime Minister Mark Carney. Mr Carney became the 24th prime minister of
Canada when he was sworn in last Friday. Both leaders posted a message
on social media following the call. Mr Albanese said in a post on X: "We
reaffirmed Australia and Canada's [**deep friendship** and our
commitment to a world where all countries can
co**-operate**]{.underline}, trade and thrive." Meanwhile, Mr Carney
said the pair spoke about "strengthening Canada and Australia's trade
and defence relationship against tariffs and a shifting global economy".

Australian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst in defence strategy
Malcolm Davis said the system worked by bouncing radar signals off the
electricity charged layer in the upper atmosphere, called the
ionosphere, to detect aircraft and ships at distances of up to 3000km.

Dr Davis said the system used relatively "old technology" but it had
been enhanced over time to be among the best; it could be used by the
Canadians to detect Russian aircraft flying into their airspace or
launching missiles at North America

"It's no coincidence that this is happening at the same time that Trump
is talking about forcing Canada to be the 51st state," Dr Davis said.

"I think [we Canadians are probably thinking we have to take steps just
to reinforce our security, **just in case we can't rely** on the
US.]{.underline}

"So this system if the Australians and the Canadians are working
together on this, it would be a system that would be deployed in
northern Canada that would bounce radar signals off the ionosphere above
the Arctic, come down to be able to watch Russian aircraft fly over
Russian airspace and across the Arctic Ocean."

The first is the need for a capability-based, portfolio approach to
Arctic investments. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates may [need to
ensure]{.mark} access, [mobility, support infrastructure]{.mark}, domain
awareness, and [communications]{.mark} [across]{.mark} multiple domains
in the [region]{.mark}.]{.underline} To achieve this, the United States
could invest in many other areas besides icebreakers.

Second, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates might do well to [focus
more on]{.mark} U.S. [ally and partner capabilities]{.mark} in the
region.]{.underline} The United States [relies on alliances, often
espousing the benefits of partnership, and indeed the United States has
"friends in high places" in the Arctic, [including NATO
allies]{.mark}]{.underline} Canada, Denmark, and Norway, as well as
healthy relationships with Sweden and Finland. [[Other non-Arctic
allies]{.mark}, such as Britain and the Netherlands, also have Arctic
military capabilities.]{.underline} It could be critical to expand joint
training and exercises with these nations, as well as to increase
emulation of some of their exquisite Arctic capabilities. Furthermore,
[[**being a good** partner also requires investment]{.mark}. For the
United States in the Arctic, this could [include gaining
interoperability and ability to share]{.mark} more in [areas where the
United States is historically strong, such as air and subsurface naval
power, as well as intelligence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Operating in the Arctic is inherently expensive: Equipment needs to be
designed or modified to withstand harsh conditions, and the costs
associated with building or maintaining infrastructure are high.
Deploying assets, equipment, and personnel there to train also is
expensive and discomfiting. Despite this, it [could be [critical]{.mark}
that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [make]{.mark} the [necessary
investments---including in partnerships---to ensure a robust ability to
operate in the Arctic]{.mark} to withstand Russian challenges in a
forbidding region.]{.underline} Making the right investments at the
right scale (i.e., averting the possibility of a new Cold War) could aid
in diplomacy, as well as in military preparedness.

require]{.mark} our [executive branch]{.mark}, along with businesses and
corporations, [to invest in infrastructure and expand connectivity. It
will require us to]{.mark} [maintain]{.mark} our [energy independence
and reverse]{.mark} growing [mineral dependence from countries such as
China]{.mark}. And it will require us to exercise serious and dedicated
Arctic diplomacy---a capacity we will have to create]{.underline}**.

The U.S. Foreign Service is the first line of America's national
security apparatus. **[Despite a budget that is no more than 3 to 5
percent the size of our defense budget, it is the State Department that
is expected to set the course for our national interests abroad, to have
the tough conversations, to try to find common ground.]{.underline}**
Yet in recent years it's been the military, sometimes out of necessity
and sometimes by mistake, that has assumed that role. As the late George
Shultz recently wrote in this very journal, "Reliance on military
threats, with little or no effort at diplomacy, is the most prominent
feature of our relations with nations that we associate with
anti-American sentiments and actions." We cannot let this trend continue
in the Arctic.

Every one of our military service branches has published a new Arctic
strategy in the last 18 months**[. [U.S. military operations in the High
North have increased in size, scale and frequency]{.mark}. In Congress,
I have sponsored and supported legislation to aid these strategies and
operations]{.underline}**. And I have commended the Defense Department
for its renewed focus on the Arctic. Make no mistake, we need an
Arctic-capable military, just as we need and expect our military to
effectively operate in all regions---deserts, jungles, mountains and
cities. Diplomacy works best with the backing of a strong military.

The military, however, cannot be the first tool of diplomacy, especially
in the Arctic, where peace has been and still is the norm. As we build
an Arctic-capable military, should we not also build an Arctic-capable
diplomatic corps?

#### [NORTHWEST PASSAGE]{.underline} -- US arctic policy in the Northwest Passage requires cooperation and expends significant diplomatic capital

The [[strategic significance of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} region [has
escalated]{.mark} due to heightened competition]{.underline} from Russia
and China, the effects of climate change, and increasing commercial
interests, prompting the United States to seek robust alliances and
partnerships with key regional allies. An examination of crucial the US
allies and partners in the Arctic unveils a system of relationships that
contribute to overall strength and cohesion in their interactions.

Foremost among these allies are NATO member countries, including Canada,
Norway, Denmark (via Greenland), Iceland, and Finland, alongside NATO
partner Sweden. These nations form the primary Arctic states within the
Arctic Council, sharing common values, military capabilities, and a
commitment to regional security, which bolsters the potential for
collective defense in the Arctic.

Furthermore, common interests, geostrategic positioning, historical
ties, shared military systems and platforms, NATO membership, joint
military exercises, aligned positions on Arctic governance, as well as
the presence of common rivals in the region, namely Russia and China,
foster cooperation among the US allies in the region. The US military
bases such as the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, Keflavik Air Force
Base in Iceland, the Marine Rotary Force in Norway, and the North
American Aerospace Defense Command provide strategic advantages and
facilitate collaborative efforts. Additionally, initiatives like the
European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) contribute to enhancing the
readiness and responsiveness of the armed forces of the United States,
NATO member states, and European allies in the Arctic.

However, [[certain factors may impede]{.mark} or weaken the [shared
interests of US allies in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Disagreements over territorial claims, divergent national policies and
economic priorities]{.mark}, geopolitical vulnerabilities, deepening
economic and trade ties with China, and other factors can create
challenges and hinder cooperation among Arctic allies.]{.underline}
Disputes between Canada and Denmark regarding the Lomonosov Ridge,
[divergent foreign economic priorities]{.underline} among Arctic
countries, [and disagreements between the United States and Canada
concerning the Northwest Passage **[can create tensions that require
diplomatic efforts to resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}, potentially
hindering the establishment of a unified position in the Arctic.

The impact of these reinforcing and weakening factors on the overall
position and interests of the United States in the Arctic region is
multifaceted. While strong alliances and partnerships bolster the US
position, diverging interests and disputes can present challenges for
achieving a cohesive approach. [Managing these challenges, [fostering
dialogue, and finding common ground are crucial for the United States to
ensure a coherent and effective strategy in the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Strengthening alliances, cultivating cooperative relationships, and
resolving disputes among the US allies in the Arctic are vital for
protecting the US interests and maintaining a robust presence in the
region.]{.underline} By l[everaging]{.underline} the strengths of its
allies, addressing challenges, and adopting a [collaborative
approach]{.underline}, the United States can navigate the evolving
Arctic landscape effectively, [promote stability and
security]{.underline}, and advance its strategic objectives in this
crucial region.

These findings have significant implications for policymakers and
stakeholders involved in Arctic affairs. Understanding the intricate
dynamics of relations among the US allies and partners in the region is
critical for fostering cooperation, resolving disputes, and identifying
areas of shared interest. By recognizing and capitalizing on reinforcing
factors while mitigating weakening factors, the United States and its
allies can intensify their joint efforts to promote stability,
sustainable development, environmental protection, and effectively
implement containment policies in the Arctic.

### L---Russia Cooperation---2NC

#### Resuming any US-Russia negotiation requires resolving conflict through diplomatic capital

**Reuters '25** \[Reuters is a global news agency and a division of
Thomson Reuters; "U.S. and Russia move toward normalizing relations and

It said this was the key impediment to maintaining stable and
sustainable staffing levels at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

Russia's ambassador to the United States said that the talks had made it
possible to make progress in normalizing the two countries' diplomatic
missions, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

"The latest round of bilateral expert consultations on normalizing the
work of the diplomatic missions of Russia and the United States took
place in a positive atmosphere and allowed us to move forward in
resolving this task set by the presidents of the two countries," TASS
cited Darchiev as saying.

It **[cited him as saying that both sides had stressed the importance of
resuming direct flights between Russia and the United States in
expanding business ties and contacts.]{.underline}**

Russia's Foreign Ministry in a statement posted on Telegram after the
talks said the priority for Moscow was to "promptly work through the
proposals that have been put forward."

"The main principle is to work out mutually agreeable solutions for the
next round of consultations, with the time frame to be agreed," the
ministry said.

The focus on restoring the work of **[[diplomatic missions come]{.mark}s
[after]{.mark} relations between the two nuclear powers were complicated
by [years of disputes]{.mark}, mutual [claims of intimidation and the
freezing of diplomatic property]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Both **[[Moscow and Washington]{.mark} have [complained]{.mark} in
recent years [about]{.mark} the [difficulties]{.mark} of getting
credentials [for their diplomats]{.mark}, making the operation of their
embassies extremely difficult.]{.underline}**

**[[Russia]{.mark} has [said]{.mark} that even [paying diplomats has
become difficult due to Western restrictions]{.mark}, [while
U.S.]{.mark} diplomats [say their movements are restricted in
Russia]{.mark}. [Both sides have complained of
intimidation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"The U.S. and Russian delegations exchanged notes to finalize an
understanding to ensure the stability of diplomatic banking for Russian
and U.S. bilateral missions," the State Department said.

It said the delegations also discussed holding a follow-up meeting on
these issues in the near term.

Among the issues is diplomatic property.

Washington has put six Russian properties under restrictions, including
the Killenworth estate on Long Island, the Pioneer Point "dacha" in
Maryland, the Russian consulates in San Francisco and Seattle and the
trade missions in Washington and New York.

ordered top officials to begin negotiations.

**[[Rubio said]{.mark} the [sides agreed]{.mark} as [a first step to

The **[[two countries have expelled diplomats and limited the
appointment]{.mark} of new [staff]{.mark} at each other\'s missions [in

leaving their respective embassies thinly staffed.]{.underline}**

**[Rubio said [those moves had \"really diminished our ability to
operate in Moscow]{.mark}\" and that Russia would say the same about its
mission in Washington.]{.underline}**

\"We\'re going to **[[need]{.mark} to have [vibrant diplomatic
missions]{.mark} that are able [to function normally]{.mark} in order to
be able to continue these conduits]{.underline}**,\" Rubio told the
Associated Press.

He said he would not negotiate in public the details of how the missions
would be restored.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for
details of the current operations of U.S. missions in Russia.

Rubio\'s Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, raised the functioning of
Russia\'s U.S. missions with Rubio in a call on Saturday ahead of the
talks in Riyadh, Russia\'s foreign ministry said.

Even before Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, U.S.
officials complained they were able to maintain only a \"caretaker
presence\" in Russia, after Russia imposed a cap on personnel in U.S.
missions, forcing Washington to shutter its consulates in Vladivostok
and Yekaterinburg.

### L---Science Diplomacy---2NC

#### Science cooperation requires diplomatic resources

Rodney W. **Nichols** **15** Rodney W. Nichols is a consultant on
science and technology policy, and was president and CEO of the New York
Academy of Sciences. "Hardly Academic"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/hardly-academic //PK

Scientific advice plays a similar role in crafting agreements on other
global issues, ranging from weather and climate change, management of
the global commons, cybersecurity, and even trade and public health.
Indeed, the underpinning of almost every durable treaty is such
expertise, something that then Secretary of State George Shultz had in
mind when he said in a famous 1984 cable to all diplomatic posts: "[[The
revolution in communications, energy, environmental sciences and other
aspects of science and technology has ... imparted an importance to
\[science and technology\] considerations in foreign affairs undreamed
of a generation ago."]{.underline}]{.mark} [[It is hard to overstate
just how much researchers in almost every discipline need
diplomats]{.underline}]{.mark}. With that in mind, since 1984 and
especially in the 1990s, the U.S. State Department has created the role
of science and technology adviser to the secretary; strengthened the
Bureau of Oceans, Environment, and International Scientific Affairs;
created interagency networks for scientific advice; and, directly and
indirectly, brought scores of scientists and engineers to work into both
the State Department and the Agency for International Development.

The [[second form]{.underline}]{.mark} of science diplomacy, which is
rarely as dramatic is the first, [[is diplomacy for
science]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here the help goes the other way. And it
is [[hard to overstate just how much researchers in almost every
discipline need diplomats.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Thousands of the
world's leading physicists and engineers]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [[would be unable to undertake high-quality research if dozens
of governments had not come together]{.underline}]{.mark} to build, at a
cost of nearly \$5 billion, CERN's particle accelerator in Geneva (and
those scientists certainly would not have made the Nobel prize--winning
discovery of the Higgs boson). [[Without a global compact to pool
resources, assemble talent, and maintain high-level diplomatic attention
over several decades, "big science" projects]{.underline}]{.mark} like
this one [[would be simply impossible.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[["Little science" also needs diplomatic help.]{.underline}]{.mark} An
American seismologist studying earthquakes in China must get permits
from Beijing. A British biologist collecting specimens in South America
must win the approval of the appropriate countries. A biomedical team
from a multinational NGO developing a new vaccine for use in Africa must
gain clearance for multi-country trials. [[At every step of the way,
good diplomatic relations between involved countries are necessary, but
more broadly, good diplomats are needed to get the exchanges approved,
facilitate immigration, sponsor international conferences, and grant
visas for faculty and students.]{.underline}]{.mark}

I assume that [[diplomatic capital is fungible within an
organization]{.underline}]{.mark} across issue areas, but is not
fungible across different organizations. That is, an individual with
high diplomatic capital can be expected to be more effective at
advancing their states' priorities across issue areas. [[Diplomats
determine how to deploy their]{.underline}
**[limited]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[social
[capital]{.mark}]{.underline}** best [[to suit their state's
goals]{.underline}]{.mark} across strategies and issue areas. Across
different issue areas within an IO, the diplomatic corps is comprised of
the same individuals, and thus strong social ties with these individuals
is expected to be equally important across issue areas. Similarly, IOs
apply the same rules and procedures across issue areas, so mastery is a
multi-purpose set of skills. [[While]{.mark} issue area]{.underline}
[[expertise is domain-specific, developing]{.underline} [a reputation as
knowledgeable]{.underline}]{.mark} and thoughtful [[about the issues at
hand]{.mark} may have generalizable reputational effects
that]{.underline} [[contribute to **fungible diplomatic
capital**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Diplomatic capital is not fungible
across institutional contexts. Institutional rules and remits vary
across IOs, as do the individuals who comprise the diplomatic corps and

multilateral permanent representation are quite different from those of
bilateral representation

competition within both Israeli and Palestinian contexts in ways that

of top-down is that it is commonly viewed as the sexy short-cut to
success; bottom-up is consistently seen as too hard, too gritty, too
low-profile, not worthy of the time, effort, and supervision of grand
statesmen and political leaders. [While there are [moments when
administrations wade into the bottom-up muck]{.mark},]{.underline} such
as the Bush Administration's important decision to stand-up the mission

[Another facet of the problem of ['political will' is that states are
self-interested actors]{.mark} that prioritise the wellbeing of their
own citizens.]{.underline} As such, they are generally reluctant to
[[commit extensive resources]{.underline} to]{.mark} prevent atrocity
crimes in other countries. The issue here is not whether governments
support atrocity prevention as a goal, [but the depth of their
[support]{.mark} relative to their other goals -- including cherished
domestic objectives such as healthcare and social welfare. **[Political
and diplomatic capital is also a finite resource]{.mark}**. Sometimes,
states may judge that **[trade-offs have to be
made]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to achieve the greatest good]{.mark} [or
least harm overall.]{.underline} For example, at the outset of the
crisis in Darfur in 2003, several states decided not to press the
government of Sudan too hard, fearing that this might jeopardise
negotiations to end the government's war with rebels in the south -- who
eventually seceded and founded their own state in 2011 with the creation
of South Sudan.

THE ART OF THE DEAL

Right now, **[Trump seems to hope that the combination of growing
economic and military harm to Iran will force the government into
agreeing to dismantle its nuclear program]{.underline}**. **[But [an
all-or-nothing offer from the United States is unlikely to
resonate]{.mark}]{.underline}** with a regime that has rejected such
terms for more than two decades---including in five rounds of
negotiations with Trump's administration. **[The only thing Iranian
leaders view as more perilous for their self-preservation than the
suffering]{.underline}** wreaked by Israeli bombs **[is surrendering to
American terms]{.underline}**. Instead, **[[the current onslaught will
probably prompt Iran to keep responding with
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}** until it can have at least a semblance
of an acceptable off-ramp.

[**[To avoid the worst-case scenarios]{.underline}**,
**[Trump]{.underline}**]{.mark} will therefore need to take a different
approach. He **[[must]{.underline}]{.mark}** first **[[persuade Iran
that he is not]{.mark}]{.underline}** just **[[a front
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
**[[Netanyahu]{.underline}]{.mark}** by pressing Israel to stop
fighting. To do so, he could threaten to suspend weapons aid to Israel.
This is the most crucial source of leverage that Washington has; it
would be extremely difficult for Israel to carry out military campaigns
without it. Previous U.S. presidents, including Joe Biden, have been
reluctant to use it. (Biden refused to wield such threats to pressure
Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.) But now, **[American
lives and Trump's legacy may be at stake]{.underline}**. **[The
president might diverge from his predecessor if he decides that U.S.
interests require containing rather than fueling]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** deepening **[crisis]{.underline}**.

**[[Trump will]{.mark} also [need to cajole Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Outgunned by Israel and, at least for now, with degraded nuclear
leverage, **[[Tehran is]{.underline}]{.mark}** probably [**[open to
returning to the table to save its neck]{.underline}**.]{.mark} More
important, it needs to save face.**[[The White
House]{.underline}]{.mark}** should warn Tehran that further escalation
could result in American casualties and suck the United States into the
conflict. Yet it **[[should]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[offer Iran a
reasonable nuclear deal]{.mark} that includes significant and
sustainable sanctions relief]{.underline}**. **[Trump
could]{.underline}**, for example, promise to **[roll
back]{.underline}** nuclear-related U.S. **[sanctions and end
the]{.underline}** primary U.S. trade **[embargo]{.underline}** **[if
Iran wraps its uranium enrichment program into a multinational
consortium]{.underline}** with Saudi Arabia for that purpose---as Tehran
expressed an openness to doing before Israel's attacks. Such a
consortium would provide fuel for nuclear reactors across the region
while depriving Iran of the fissile material it could use for a weapon.

**[[There is precedent for this kind of American
pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan
twisted Israel's arm to end its bombing of Beirut. In 1988, he
intervened in the Iran-Iraq War, playing an essential role in persuading
Tehran to accept a cease-fire. Such a course will not be easy for Trump.
It would require the president to commit to difficult diplomacy while
staring down fierce opposition in Washington from politicians and
interest groups who see Israel's campaign as an overdue comeuppance for
one of the United States' most bitter adversaries.

But **[[if Trump is committed to a nuclear-free
Iran]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[[his best bet is to]{.mark} get the
Iranians and Israelis to stop the war and [bring Tehran back to the
negotiating table]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Without a deal, Iran's
frightened government seems more likely]{.mark} than not [to sprint for
nuclear weapons]{.mark} as conditions allow.]{.underline}** **[Then
Trump would have to either accept a nuclear Iran or join another Israeli
assault on the country, risking precisely the kind of catastrophic
Middle East entanglement he promised to avoid.]{.underline}**

**[While]{.underline}** the U.S. military's **[strikes]{.underline}** on
Iran on June 21 are believed to have **[damaged]{.underline}** the
country's critical **[nuclear infrastructure]{.underline}**, **[no
evidence]{.underline}** has yet **[emerged]{.underline}** **[showing the
program]{.underline}** to have been **[completely
destroyed.]{.underline}**

As a scholar of nuclear nonproliferation, my research indicates that
**[[military strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as the U.S. one
against Iran, [**[tend not to work]{.underline}**.
**[Diplomacy]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- involving broad and resolute
international efforts --- **[[offers a more strategically effective way
to preempt a country from obtaining a nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The strategy of a country using airstrikes to attempt to eliminate a
rival nation's nuclear program has precedent, including Israel's 1981
airstrike on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor and its 2007 air assault on
Syria's Kibar nuclear complex.

Yet neither military operation reliably or completely terminated the
targeted program. Many experts of nuclear strategy believe that while
the Israeli strike destroyed the Osirak complex, it likely accelerated
former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's commitment to pursue a nuclear
weapon, and while Israeli airstrikes destroyed Syria's nascent nuclear
facility, evidence soon emerged that nuclear activities may have
continued elsewhere.

The tactics involved in nuclear diplomacy include bilateral and
multilateral engagement, comprehensive economic and social sanctions ---
trade and financial penalties, exclusion from global sporting and
cultural events --- and transformative aid incentives.

How countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America were denuclearized

I've found that **[[since 1970]{.underline}]{.mark}**, when most of the
world signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
obligating nonnuclear weapons states to forgo them and existing nuclear
powers to share civilian nuclear technology and eventually relinquish
their nuclear weapons, **[[diplomacy played a pivotal role in convincing
nuclear-seeking nations to entirely and permanently abandon]{.mark}
their [pursuit of nuclear weapons]{.mark}. The military strategy cannot
claim a single clear denuclearization success]{.underline}**.
**[Denuclearization through diplomacy succeeded in Argentina, Brazil,
Libya, South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan]{.underline}**.

In the cases of U.S. allies Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and Taiwan,
the military option was off the table for Washington, which instead
successfully used diplomatic pressure to induce these countries to
discontinue their nuclear programs.

South Africa represents one of the most compelling cases in support of
diplomatic measures to reverse a country's nuclear path.

In 1991, the country decided to relinquish that arsenal, due in large
part to the high economic, technological and cultural costs of sanctions
and the belief that its nuclear program would prevent its reintegration
into the international community following years of apartheid.

Completing the denuclearization of Africa, diplomatic pressure applied
by the U.S. was the primary factor in Libya's decision to shutter its
nuclear program in 2003.

In the 11 countries in which diplomacy was used to reverse nuclear
proliferation, only in the cases of India and Pakistan, did it fail to
induce any nuclear reversal.

In the case of North Korea, while Pyongyang did for a time join the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it later left the
accord and subsequently built an arsenal now estimated at several dozen
nuclear weapons. The decades-long efforts at diplomacy with the country
cannot, therefore, be coded a success. Still, these efforts did result
in notable moves in 1994 and 2007 by North Korea to curtail its nuclear
facilities.

Iran nuclear deal offered security and a new one could go a long way

Meanwhile, analysts debate whether diplomacy would have been more
successful at containing North Korea's nuclear program if President
George W. Bush's administration had not shifted toward a more
confrontational policy.

Trump signaled quickly after the recent attack on Iran a willingness to
engage in direct talks with Tehran. However, Iran may rebuff any
agreement that effectively contains its nuclear program, opting instead
for the intensified underground approach Iraq took after the 1981 Osirak
attack.

Indeed, my research shows that combining military threats with diplomacy
reduces the prospects of successfully reaching a disarmament agreement.
**[[Nations will be more reluctant to disarm when their negotiating
counterpart adopts a threatening and combative
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[as it heightens their fear that
disarmament will make it more vulnerable]{.underline}** to future
aggression from the opposing country.

But **[by signing the JCPOA]{.underline}**, the nuclear deal constructed
by the Obama Administration, and complying with it, as verified by the
IAEA, **[[Iran]{.mark} has [demonstrated a willingness to cooperate on
the nuclear issue]{.mark} in the past]{.underline}**. Under the
agreement, **[Iran accepted a highly limited and low-proliferation-risk
nuclear program subject to intrusive inspections by the international
community]{.underline}**.

[**[That arrangement was beneficial for regional stability and for
buttressing the global norm against nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}**. **[A return to a JCPOA-type agreement
would reinforce a diplomatic approach]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to
relations with Iran [and create an opening for progress with the country
on other areas of concern.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Nuclear talks are the only way to stop a defensive Tehran from going nuclear.

Trump Must Now Negotiate With Iran", TIME Magazine,

On Monday, after Iran targeted the largest U.S. military base in
Qatar in a choreographed response to the American bombing of its nuclear
facilities, President Donald Trump briskly dismissed Tehran's attack
and announced a ceasefire. 

In the short term, the U.S. leader's declaration and subsequent lashing
out against ceasefire violations might have ended the recent war between
the regional rivals---but over the long term, the future of the conflict
between **[[Tehran]{.mark} and [Tel Aviv]{.mark} depends on how the
various parties [manage]{.mark} what remains a [brittle
peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

It is clear that, when Trump announced the ceasefire, Iran and Israel
were ready to stop fighting. Israel's military success was undisputed;
it had assassinated scores of Iranian military leaders, damaged several
Iranian nuclear facilities and missile sites, and dominated Iranian
skies. Yet it was also **[incomplete, in terms of Israel's stated goal
of destroying the Iranian nuclear program]{.underline}**; U.S. bombings
pushed the program back, but reportedly only by a few months. 

On the other side, although bruised and bloodied, Iran could insist on
being unbowed, on holding its own with enough of its missiles
penetrating the Iron Dome and other Israeli air defense systems to
compel Tel Aviv and the United States to seek a ceasefire. 

Yet this tenuous pause in fighting does not lay the foundations of
peace. Israel has already said it will strike **[[Iran]{.mark} again if
it [resumes]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear effort[s]{.mark}. And
[unless]{.mark} there is a new comprehensive [nuc]{.mark}lear
[deal]{.mark} [between Iran]{.mark} and the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [Tehran]{.mark} is likely to [seek]{.mark} to
reassemble its [nuc]{.mark}lear program. That [s]{.mark}ets the [stage
for]{.mark} another [confrontation]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

It won't happen immediately, of course. Iran needs to introspect upon
the magnitude of its losses, address its immense intelligence
vulnerabilities, regroup its battered military apparatus after the spate
of assassinations, and more generally rebuild its defenses. Israel,
meanwhile, needs to rebuild and improve its air defenses which failed to
prevent Iranian missiles from striking strategic and civilian targets.

None of this, however, would stop Israel from continuing to launch
lower-level attacks on Iran despite the ceasefire---applying the same
strategy it has used in Lebanon despite its ceasefire with Hezbollah.
Such attacks would elicit limited retaliation, as for now Iran's focus
is likely to be on recovering from the recent war.

The **[[long road to]{.mark} a lasting [peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Further out, the question is: how do we go from the events of the past
few weeks to real stability, not another return to war? How, in other
words, **[does [stability]{.mark} [return]{.mark} to the
region?]{.underline}**

The answer hinges on **[two major factors]{.underline}**---one inside
Iran, and the other [to do with [**diplomacy** between]{.mark} the
[U.S]{.mark}. and [Tehran]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

Domestically, beyond replenishing and rebuilding its military capacity,
**[for there to be stablity]{.underline}** in the Middle East, Iran has
to address its greatest vulnerability: an angry population. 

Iranians have been at odds with the country's leadership for some time.
Economic hardship and isolation have taken a toll, and an increasingly
large number of Iranian citizens no longer subscribe to the Islamic
Republic's revolutionary values or support its foreign policy, which
they blame for the country's isolation and economic woes. 

The more ambiguously stated objective of Israel and the United States
during the war was to incite the Iranians to rebel and topple the
Islamic Republic. Iranians did no such thing. Yet in the coming days,
domestic popular anger at Israeli aggression and the consequent material
and psychological loss that Iranians have suffered is likely to lead to
serious questioning of the Islamic Republic's policies.

After all, Iranians are patriotic but they also crave peace, security,
and economic prosperity. Israeli attacks killed hundreds of
civilians and injured thousands more, and destroyed or damaged hundreds
of homes and civilian infrastructure, including oil refineries which
have led to fuel shortages. The expected conversation and contestation
between the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic and the response of
the regime will be important in determining how Tehran manages the
ceasefire. 

Beyond Iran, the ceasefire also presents a test for President Trump. He
**[took a risk by getting the U.S.]{.underline}** involved in the attack
on Iran. As we have already seen, unease about the U.S. getting dragged
into another brutal, expensive, and potentially long war in the Middle
East created factures within his MAGA movement.  

Now, with the ceasefire, President **[[Trump]{.mark} has a direct [stake
in]{.mark} ensuring that the [peace]{.mark} holds]{.underline}**. To
make it last, he needs to effectively manage Israel's Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who might see benefits in breaking the ceasefire to
further establish military dominance over Tehran. It is also possible
that he might break it to handicap any **[renewed diplomatic [efforts
between]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} and [Iran]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the
latter's [nuc]{.mark}lear ambition[s]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

But that is **[precisely what the [U.S.]{.mark} must do now to
[create]{.mark} a [pathway for]{.mark} a durable [peace]{.mark}: work
towards [resuming]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear [talks with
Tehran]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

Even after this war, **[[Iran]{.mark} still [possesses]{.mark} its
stockpile of [400 kilo]{.mark}gram[s]{.mark} of highly enriched
[Uranium]{.mark} that]{.underline}**, if still intact, could be used
**[to [build]{.mark} as many as [10 nuc]{.mark}lear
bomb[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to U.S. military estimates. And
**[it retains the expertise]{.underline}** to rebuild its nuclear
program. The speed at which Iran could move toward weaponization---if it
makes that decision---depends on how much of its highly enriched uranium
survived the American and Israeli bombing of nuclear sites. 

To learn that, the United States has to ensure ongoing access to nuclear
sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors ( the Iranian
parliament has moved a bill to suspend cooperation with the IAEA). All
this would have to be **[part of a nuclear deal. ]{.underline}**

**[Iran has been clearly weakened by this war but that [won't
make]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear [diplomacy]{.mark} with the United
States straightforward or [easy]{.mark};]{.underline}** it also
understands that President Trump has a stake in maintaining the
ceasefire and ensuring that there isn't a resumption of a war that could
easily spiral into a wider regional conflagration, exacting grave
political costs for all involved. 

And so**[, President [Trump]{.mark} might now have to [consider
incentives]{.mark}]{.underline}** other than coercion and the threat of
further bombing Iranian nuclear sites.

This might mean offering Iran greater economic relief, giving it
guarantees that the U.S. will not seek or support regime change, and
provide a security guarantee against future Israeli attacks. Ultimately,
the Iranians do not trust the U.S. leader. He walked away from the 2015
nuclear deal and allowed Israel to attack Iran while he was still
negotiating a nuclear deal with Tehran. So the bar for him to win their
trust is very high.

This fraught history is bound to make **[renewed [nuc]{.mark}lear
[negotiations]{.mark} more [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Still,
Iran needs to address its economic challenges, and Trump could offer the
incentive of sanctions relief, guarantee that it would happen quickly,
and won't be easily reversed. And Trump too needs a deal to
**[[avoid]{.mark} the risk of entering the United States into yet
[another war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Successful [nucl]{.mark}ear
[diplomacy]{.mark}---]{.underline}**hard as it might be---is still
possible, and **[remains the [best option]{.mark} for both Iran and the
United States.]{.underline}**

In the multipolar era, **[every war serves as a flashpoint through which
the evolving balance of power is tested and contested]{.underline}**.
The recent escalation between **[[India and Pakistan]{.mark} in South
Asia, and [Israel and Iran]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}**,
reveals the realist underpinnings of conflicts -- particularly in a
world where no conflict can be resolved unilaterally by a single power.
These case studies **[[demonstrate crisis diplomacy in
action]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though **[employed only after the
conflicts had broken out into]{.underline}** limited
**[wars]{.underline}** with conventional military engagement. The
international community's response was delayed in both instances as
great powers calibrated their mediation efforts based on strategic
interests, competing narratives, risk of nuclear escalation and regional
alignments. **[Understanding the mediation efforts by the United States,
China, and the Gulf States in each context is imperative to decode
crisis diplomacy]{.underline}** -- a tool employed to serve strategic
interests to protect the global order rather than a normative imperative
to de-escalate conflicts.

**[[The case of India and Pakistan]{.mark}'s recent four day
war]{.underline}** provides critical lessons for decoding crisis
diplomacy by international actors. It began with attacks on tourists in
the Pahalgam valley of Kashmir on 22 April, killing 26 people, which
spiraled into what can be termed as the deadliest military confrontation
between two nuclear armed states. This incident redefined security
dilemma in terms of narrative building as Indian threat perception of
Pakistan supporting terrorism led them to initiate the first military
strike. Pakistan responded by denying any involvement and showed
willingness to jointly investigate this incident.

However, **[[India pulled various diplomatic pressure tactics
including]{.underline}]{.mark}** the abeyance of **[[the Indus Water
Treaty]{.mark} (1960)]{.underline}**, which provides for 80% of
Pakistan's water supply. Feeling threatened by this move, Pakistan
termed this as an 'act of war'. It became a security dilemma for both
sides as war broke out on May 7th, 2025 with conventional military
strikes by India targeting supposed terrorist camps in the civilian
heartland of Pakistan. **[This [conflict kept
climbing]{.mark}]{.underline}** the escalation ladder as Pakistan's
retaliatory posture signaled serious regional fallout, including nuclear
risks, **[which [led]{.mark} great powers especially [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [to diplomatically resolve it]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The Iran-Israel confrontation centered on the nuclear question which
became the security dilemma for Israel. The narrative about Iran's
nuclear program and supposed weaponization prompted Israel to launch
attacks on three of Iran's nuclear sites -- Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan
on June 13th, 2025. It killed dozens of the top scientists and military
leaders involved in the Iranian nuclear program. A direct military
standoff between the two erupted where Iran and Israel bombarded each
other with hundreds of missiles, lasting for 12 days. America's stance
on the conflict initially supported Israel going as far as to provide
military assistance and even striking nuclear targets in Iran with more
force on the behest of Israel. Iran's retaliation shifted towards
American bases in Qatar where it targeted the Al-Udeid air base.

Despite warnings from **[the U.S stressing the need for
diplomacy]{.underline}**, Iran did not let any attack on its sovereignty
go unanswered, according to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC). **[Along with the military action, Iran also threatened to close
the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}**, an important global chokepoint
which accounts for **[20% of the world's oil flows]{.underline}**.
**[These actions prompted a sudden need for crisis
diplomacy]{.underline}** as the war kept ascending the escalation ladder
with the threat of a nuclear fallout. President Trump announced the
ceasefire right after the Iranian response. While other powers such as
China, Russia, and the Gulf States were involved in back door diplomacy,
the risk of military involvement and potential spillover became too
high.

**[[Conflicts that]{.mark} continue to [escalate without any bilateral
negotiation]{.mark} in sight [require international
mediation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, this mediation is laced with
strategic interests rather than a normative approach. It can be gathered
by analyzing the response of the international community to the South
Asian and Middle Eastern wars. **[The process of diplomatic mediation is
built around certain structural drivers that international actors pursue
in order to chart a pathway towards conflict resolution]{.underline}**.
Some of these factors include the nature of the conflict, its linkages
with the geopolitical and geoeconomic effects on the international
system, and the relations between the mediator and the parties in
dispute.

The nature of India-Pakistan conflict is shaped by the risk of nuclear
escalation that threatens the regional stability whereas this dynamic is
somewhat similarly evident in the Iran-Israel war, as these states have
not yet reached the declared nuclear deterrence as seen in South Asia.
Their conflict is increasingly framed by nuclear threat perceptions, and
strategic ambiguity -- making it a latent nuclear crisis. Furthermore,
geo-economics also drive great power interests -- the case of South Asia
where China's Belt and Road initiative, America's interest in
counterterrorism and energy security, and the Gulf states' labor force
driven from the Asian diaspora prompts their efforts to prevent war. The
Middle Eastern region holds key geo-economic interests for major powers
-- the Strait of Hormuz being the central driver.

Alliance management is another structural driver that involves the
relation between the disputant parties and international actors which
requires a delicate game of balancing power projection. In case of the
India and Pakistan, historically, the United States has remained a major
mediator. However, a shift in the American policy was observed with the
onset of Trump's term which included a more isolationist approach. His
initial statements on the war reflected this stance. The remarks by the
U.S Vice President JD Vance were similar as he claimed in an interview
that "America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't
tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms."

It clearly indicates that American interests in the region were
untouched. It was also due to the nature of the conflict which supported
India's stronger narrative reflected in its media as well as its
military strikes that prompted Washington to support India in its quest
for countering terrorism. However, the shift in the balance of power
came with Pakistan's retaliation on May 10th, 2025. **[Almost [after 12
hours since Pakistan's retaliation, Trump declared a cessation of
hostilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Pakistan's retaliation sparked a
spike in the escalation levels touching the nuclear threshold which
breached American alliance commitments and urged them to implement
crisis diplomacy for resolution.

**[[The Middle Eastern war presents a similar scenario]{.mark} as
American commitments favored Israel]{.underline}**. The diplomatic talks
with Iran revisiting the nuclear deal encouraged Iran to 'limit' its
nuclear program, with some American senior officials pushing for
'complete dismantlement'. Israel's security dilemma got ignited by
Iran's uranium enrichment up to 60% which led them to pressurize the
American government to take a hard-liner towards Iran. Israel decided to
take matters into its own hands when it attacked Iran's nuclear sites,
forcing a direct military standoff in the region. American position, in
this regard, favored Israel as they provided them with air defense and
munitions against Iranian attacks. Iran has regional support from
Pakistan, China, and Russia, however, their hesitance for direct
involvement in a war against the U.S indicates the alliance balancing in
precarious situations.

The Iran-Israel war escalated without any feasible diplomatic mediation
in sight. The United States, despite being deterred from joining the
war, intervened when it struck Iran's nuclear sites with more force
using advanced B2 bombers along with '75 precision-guided weapons'. This
realist strategy of using force to deter the opponent failed as Iran
responded by attacking the largest U.S air base in the Middle East. With
the U.S intervening in the war militarily, this might open up
possibilities for other great powers such as Russia or China to
indirectly intervene in the conflict supporting Iran. Eventually,
**[[when]{.mark} the [stakes]{.mark} [increase]{.mark}d, [American
interests shift]{.mark}ed [towards]{.mark} adopting [a diplomatic
approach by announcing a ceasefire]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The [fear
of spillover]{.mark} effects [of war]{.mark} in other regions along with
another costly engagement [for the U.S was against its interests that
paved way for a successful diplomatic
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Conflicts are driven by a security dilemma faced by the aggressor state
that pushes for military escalation as the only solution. In such cases,
**[[crisis diplomacy]{.mark} is a vital tool for conflict
resolution]{.underline}**. However, **[it [can only be initiated by
global powers willing to de-escalate a conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
In the recent short term wars, diplomatic intervention was aided and
abetted by global powers only when their interests were challenged. The
normative dimensions of mediating for maintaining peace is a fallacy in
international relations as the world is driven by interests rather than
ideals. **[In case of South Asia and the Middle East, [preventing a
nuclear catastrophe was one of the major interests that had driven great
powers towards a strong mediation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The costs of
war are too high for both sides but with the consequences having
significant impacts on the global order, **[major powers are compelled
to mediate and eventually bring about a ceasefire.]{.underline}**

CRISIS MANAGEMENT

**[Since returning]{.underline}** to office in January 2025,
**[Trump]{.underline}** had **[suggested]{.underline}** that **[he
wanted]{.underline}** to reach **[an agreement]{.underline}** with Iran
on its nuclear program. Israel has made clear its preference for a
military solution, however, unless Iran completely capitulates over the
program. Israel also made clear that it believed that now was the time
to act. Tehran's defensive capabilities did not recover after a series
of pinpoint strikes that Israel carried out last October. Iran's
proxies, including Hezbollah, are still on their knees after months of
Israeli attacks. The Israeli government thus saw a golden opportunity to
debilitate its nemesis.

Israel's current campaign against Iran is far broader than its previous
ones. Approximately 200 Israeli aircraft targeted around 100 sites,
including nuclear facilities and military bases, in the initial wave of
strikes last week. Covert operations by the Mossad targeted Iranian
leaders, resulting in the deaths of key figures in the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps and prominent nuclear scientists. As the
exchanges between the two countries have grown more severe, and Iran has
retaliated with drones and missiles, both sides have broadened their
targets.

**[[Given]{.mark} the breadth of [Israel's assault, Iranian
leaders]{.mark} likely [concluded]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[Israel
wants to wipe out]{.underline}]{.mark}** not just their nuclear program
but also **[[their regim]{.mark}e]{.underline}** itself. Although Iran
lacks the capabilities of its enemy---its intelligence is no match for
Israel's, and its airpower is nonexistent---**[[Tehran felt it had no
choice but to retaliate as forcefully as
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So far, at least in the opening days,
**[this has]{.underline}** largely **[been confined to a bilateral
conflict]{.underline}**. **[But [Iran may opt to externalize its
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[hitting U.S. bases]{.mark} in the
region, [striking energy]{.mark}]{.underline}** infrastructure **[in the
Gulf]{.underline}**, and **[[targeting]{.mark} shipping lanes in [the
Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example---**[[which would
plunge the region into turmoil]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By doing so**[,
Iranian officials might hope they can get Washington to lean on Israel
to stop]{.underline}**.

But **[[if the war expands, Iran and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[might]{.mark} find themselves
[fight]{.mark}ing [directly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially if
American assets and interests come under fire. In repeated statements,
U.S. officials have warned Tehran against such attacks, lest American
forces, in the words of Trump, "come down on you at levels never seen
before." Should **[[Iranian attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** or attacks by
Iran's nonstate partners **[[lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark} American
casualties, the [pressure on the U.S.]{.mark} president [to act
decisively]{.mark} and enter the war would increase
dramatically.]{.underline}**

**[[Even if the United States avoids fighting in this conflict]{.mark},
without a deal, [it risks getting pulled into a future
one]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Israeli military
operations]{.underline}** over the past year **[have logged successes
against Hezbollah and against Iran itself]{.underline}**, **[degrading
many of its enemies' air defenses]{.underline}**. Still, most estimates
suggest that **[Israel could set Iran's nuclear program back by only a
few months]{.underline}**, or a year at best. **[[It would take intense
American military might to destroy much of Tehran's capacity to build a
nuclear weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And depending on how Iran has
structured its program, **[stopping a bomb may require no less than a
toppling of the Islamic Republic]{.underline}**. That is why Israeli
officials are more explicitly sounding the call for regime change. Yet
they have paid little heed to what would actually replace the current
system. In the absence of a viable, united, and organized alternative
inside or outside Iran, the fall of the Islamic Republic might send the
country into a period of civil strife---or lead to a military
dictatorship determined to obtain nuclear deterrence.

**[For an American president who has sought to position himself as a
peacemaker]{.underline}** rather than a belligerent, **[the present
situation ought to be ringing loud alarm bells]{.underline}**. **[Many
of Trump's constituents oppose renewed U.S. military involvement in the
Middle East]{.underline}**. A massive war would also cause oil prices to
spike, further burdening American consumers struggling with inflation.
In fact, oil prices are already rising. Trump will thus benefit if the
fighting stops, and suffer if it expands.

Middle East

For a few days last month it looked as though **[[the war
between Israel and Iran]{.mark} would [explode into]{.mark} an all-out
[regional conflict]{.mark}, [dragging in the US]{.mark} and Western
allies on one side, and potentially [Russia]{.mark}
[and China]{.mark} on the other.]{.underline}**

In little more than 24 hours, the **[[US launched air strikes]{.mark}
against Iran\'s nuclear facilities, [and Iran retaliated]{.mark} against
an American airbase [in Qatar]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just hours later
Donald Trump announced a US-mediated ceasefire, which has so far held.

It marked the latest flashpoint in a region that has been in a state of
chaos ever since Hamas launched its surprise attack against Israel on 7
October 2023. That led to the subsequent invasion of Gaza, weakening of
Hezbollah in Lebanon, the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and the
Israel-Iran conflict.

**[Last week, the Pentagon announced the massive wave of [strikes

[back by]{.mark} just [one]{.mark} to two [year]{.mark}s]{.underline}**.

to resume next week**[. [Israeli officials are confident]{.mark} that
[Trump will give them the green light to launch]{.mark} [further]{.mark}
attacks if the Islamic regime revives its nuclear
ambitions]{.underline}**, said Axios.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu used his visit to Washington this week to
discuss how to secure a lasting settlement in the region, and hand his
host at the White House a letter nominating him for the Nobel Peace
Prize.

\"The award has become Trump\'s ultimate fixation,\" said CNN, \"one he
says is well deserved for his efforts to end conflicts around the globe,
including the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\"

**[But \"[a lasting resolution]{.mark} to that 21-month conflict [will

willingness to accept a [deal that stops]{.mark} the

#### Shifts in power balance in the Middle East ensure escalation

//genny

JERUSALEM --- While the world was bracing for President Donald Trump's
decision on whether to bomb Iran and the tectonic waves that would
follow, here in the Middle East, the earthquake had already struck.

**[[Israel's]{.underline}]{.mark}** go-for-broke **[[attacks on
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** launched just over a week ago --- after
decades of intense but largely covert conflict between the two powers
--- **[[have]{.mark} dramatically [shifted the strategic
balance]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to analysts in Israel,
**[[across the region and beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And those
fundamental changes look to prevail even after American bombers entered
the fray this weekend.

Israel's assault caps a string of upheavals that would have been
inconceivable before the attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel on
Oct. 7, 2023, including the routing of three Iranian allies: Hamas in
the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the regime of Bashar al-Assad
in Syria.

**[Now, Israeli fighter jets are operating with impunity over the
Iranian capital]{.underline}**, Tehran, and Iran --- perceived for years
by not only Israel but many countries in the Arab Gulf region as the
primary menace --- has been exposed as a far hollower military force
than many in the world believed**[. [The decades-old status quo has been
shattered]{.mark}, [with Israel]{.mark} now ascendant as [the Middle
East's unchallenged]{.mark} military [power]{.mark}, Iran and its "axis
of resistance" in disarray, and these two foes --- for the first time
--- locked in direct combat.]{.underline}**

"The region is fundamentally different now," said Ali Vaez, Iran project
director at the International Crisis Group in Washington. "**[The name
of the game for decades was that Israel and Iran would engage through
proxies and covert operations. That [it has turned into an open
conflict]{.mark} is something I really didn't foresee."]{.underline}**

He and other analysts were quick to say that the outcome of this
conflict is far from clear, and the reshuffling of the regional order is
far from over.

**[[Iran is]{.mark} weakened but [not defeated]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Its nuclear enrichment program is damaged, but it remains unclear
whether it has been destroyed.

**[Possible [endgames]{.mark}, Vaez said, [include]{.mark} the collapse
of the Iranian regime, which by no means would assure the end of enmity;
a military quagmire sucking in Israel and Iran, which could further
destabilize the region; and, perhaps most feared, [a determination by
Iran that its survival requires the speedy development of a nuclear
weapon.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

While this unfolding drama has yet to be resolved, **[the region has
already been transformed in several essential ways]{.underline}**,
according to Middle East analysts.

Israel no longer faces the intense threats from just across its borders
once posed by Hamas and Hezbollah, which have been reeling since their
longtime leaders were killed and much of their fighting forces decimated
by Israel. A much-diminished Hamas is still trying to put up a fight
amid the devastation of the Gaza war, while Hezbollah is unwilling, and
perhaps unable, to retaliate against Israel for its attacks on Iran.

Syrian rebels have shaken off the tyranny of the Assad regime and with
it, the influence of Iran and Russia, which had long dominated relations
between Syria and the world. Both Syria and Lebanon, where Hezbollah's
political sway has receded, have at least a chance for renewal.

"The Levant has flipped," said Paul Salem, former president of the
Middle East Institute in Beirut. "Both Syria and Lebanon are on a new
and hopefully promising trajectory."

And Israel has rebounded from the devastating Oct. 7 attacks of 20
months ago. While Israeli hostages are still held by Hamas, and Israeli
troops continue to wage a calamitous military campaign in Gaza, Israel
is now in its strongest strategic position in decades, operating
militarily beyond its borders in Lebanon, southern Syria and now over
Iran.

[**["We've never used the word unprecedented so
often]{.underline}**,"]{.mark} said Renad Mansour, a senior research
fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.

Mansour likened the recent changes in the regional order, culminating in
Israel's attack on Iran, to some of the most consequential upheavals
seen by the Middle East in the past half-century. These include the oil
shocks of the 1970s, the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, the long
Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s and the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

"This will be one of those hugely impactful moments in the history
books," he said. "What emerges after this will not look like it was on
Oct. 6. Israel's attack on Iran cements that."

Especially striking are the rapid deterioration of Iran's strategic
position and the collapse of its decades-long enterprise to project
power across the region via a network of allied militant armies,
including in Iraq and Yemen.

"Iran was an imperial power that once boasted of controlling four Arab
capitals: Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Sanaa," said Salem. "I mean, my
God have they come down in the world?"

Iran spent decades organizing and funding militant groups, and
developing missile and drone technologies to arm them. Israeli officials
estimated, for example, that Hezbollah had more than 100,000 rockets
stockpiled before Israel targeted them.

Governments in the region long feared the chaos Iran could unleash, and
Tehran exploited these anxieties to further expand its sway. When
missiles and drones launched from Iran sent fireballs over Saudi Arabian
oil fields in 2019, Trump, in his first term, declined to retaliate
despite pleas from several regional powers to act.

"Nobody thought they could do anything," said Ksenia Svetlova, director
of the Israel-based Regional Organization for Peace, Economics and
Security. "We were accustomed for decades Iran trying to export Islamic
revolution, overthrow governments and sponsor terror groups." She said
she had heard many people in Arab Gulf countries say they were looking
for someone to take on the Iranians. "And that someone they meant was
Israel," Svetlova said.

Israel has dealt a series of blows to Iran's nuclear and military
efforts in recent years, engaging in sabotage and assassinations. Then
last year, for the first time, Iran and Israel began openly trading
strikes, initially triggered by a fatal Israeli attack on the Iranian
consulate in Damascus, Syria, and Israeli forces succeeded in knocking
out key Iranian air defenses. Since the tensions erupted into full
conflict this month, Israeli forces have killed senior military
officials and nuclear scientists; targeted nuclear, military, industrial
and other sites; and demonstrated an ability to carry out attacks from
the air and through covert operations with little if any resistance.

**["The most important change is [Israel]{.mark}'s escalation
dominance,]{.underline}**" said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle
East envoy under both Republican and Democratic administrations. **["It
[has]{.mark} something it's never had before, [the ability to
control]{.mark} the pace and intensity of [conflicts in ways that no one
can match."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Israelis are feeling bullish about their new status as the region's
unchallenged hegemon.

"I don't believe Israel has been in a such a strong strategic position
since I've been here," said Natan Sharansky, a former Israeli politician
who came to Israel after being imprisoned as a dissident in the Soviet
Union. "Suddenly all these challenges, especially the Iran challenge,
can be faced on a different plane."

How Israel wields this unrivaled power will determine much about the
future of the region. A confident Israel, for instance, could strike
agreements to wind down the hostilities in Gaza, address Palestinian
demands and relieve tensions elsewhere along its borders.

But Miller said that the **[[political pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces from the extremist right-wing
members of his governing coalition **[[makes it
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}** for him **[[to convert military might
into ceasefires]{.underline}]{.mark}** and peace treaties that could
produce regional stability.

**[Trump's decision to order [U.S. forces in]{.mark}to [action
will]{.mark} probably also [roil the Middle East further]{.mark}, even
if the American military operation proves successful.]{.underline}** The
ultimate reverberations are hard to predict.

"If we have a massive U.S. bombardment, we may have something like
Libya, with Iran descending into internal chaos," Vaez said in an
interview before the U.S. airstrikes were carried out, warning of
**[[repercussions throughout the region and
beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "Think of the waves of refugees to Europe
from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and imagine adding a country of 90
million people to the mix."

BEIRUT --- It has been one setback after another for Iran --- the loss
of its own and allied military commanders in Israeli strikes, death and
disarray in the ranks of Hezbollah and, in response, a ballistic missile
attack on Israel whose destruction appeared limited.

Former U.S. **[[officials]{.mark} and analysts [worry]{.mark} that
[Iran's]{.mark} conventional [losses]{.mark} are exactly the kind of
development that could [trigger]{.mark} a final [dash to]{.mark} the
[bomb]{.mark}. [Iran]{.mark} has spent years moving ever [closer
to]{.mark} acquiring a [capability for nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} since then-President Donald [Trump scuttled]{.mark} the
[Iran nuclear deal]{.mark} in 2018,]{.underline}** according to U.S. and
U.N. assessments.

Now, even short of a **[move toward [weaponization, Iran]{.mark} may be
willing to [increase]{.mark} use of its [potential nuc]{.mark}lear
status [to deter]{.mark} its adversaries.]{.underline}** And that
appears to be informing Israeli leaders as they consider a response
to the barrage of around 180 ballistic missiles.

"Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it," Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned after Tuesday's attack. "The regime
in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to
retaliate against our enemies."

While visually spectacular --- videos of Iranian missiles lighting up
the Tel Aviv sky played on a loop on Iranian state television for days
--- the munitions that actually made it though Israel's defenses don't
appear to have caused the extensive damage Iran intended.

The attack was "extraordinary," "legal" and "legitimate," said Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while leading Friday prayers in
Tehran. But his remarks also struck a somber tone, acknowledging recent
losses, particularly the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hasan
Nasrallah, whom he praised as a "brother" and "shining jewel of
Lebanon."

Israeli city of Arad, on Thursday. (Heidi Levine for The Washington
Post)

Khamenei vowed that Iran's support for the resistance was unwavering and
called on the country's allies to "tighten the belt of defense." Moving
forward, he said Iran will "neither procrastinate nor hurry in doing our
duty.

Iran's defensive posture, however, has taken a number of hits over the
past year as Israel has waged war on Hamas in Gaza, launched airstrikes
against the Houthis in Yemen, and most recently narrowed its focus on
Hezbollah in Lebanon. All three groups, along with militias in Iraq and
Syria, make up Iran's "axis of resistance," a loose network of allied
groups that were established in part to insulate Tehran from regional
threats.

"If the axis of resistance isn't working then the **[[only
deterrent]{.mark} might be [a nuc]{.mark}lear deterrent]{.underline}**,"
said David Albright, a nuclear weapons expert and president of
the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington
nonprofit. The weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah, combined with Iran's
failure to inflict significant damage on Israel with its missile
strikes, means "there's a better chance **[[Iran]{.mark} could
[decide]{.mark} to [build nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he said.

Losses to Hezbollah have been particularly devastating for Iran.

"When you think of a chess board, Hezbollah is Iran's queen. It's the
most successful militia force that Iran created," said Sina Azodi, an
expert on Iran and a lecturer at George Washington University. The
degradation of Hezbollah leaves Iran more exposed, because it "gives
Israel more freedom of action in the region," Azodi said.

Inside Iran, there was an abrupt shift in rhetoric around nuclear
weapons in the weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and
Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza**[. [Previously, Iran]{.mark}ian
leaders had [denied]{.mark} having any intention [to develop
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But **[over the [past
year]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in speeches and interviews,
**[[officials]{.mark} have [asserted]{.mark} that [Tehran]{.mark}
already [possessed everything]{.mark} it needed [for]{.mark} a
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon]{.underline}** but had opted to exercise
restraint.

"In terms of our national security, we do not want to do it," Mohammad
Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said in January.
"It is **[not about the lack of capability]{.underline}**."

A report issued by the U.S. Office of the Director of National
Intelligence in February **[described the [Iranian nuclear
threat]{.mark} in [starker]{.mark} terms compared with previous
assessments.]{.underline}** While Iran does not appear to be actively
developing a weapon**[, [Tehran]{.mark} since 2020 "has [stated]{.mark}
that it is [no]{.mark} longer [constrain]{.mark}ed [by]{.mark}" the
[nuclear]{.mark} [deal's limits]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.mark} has
"**[[undertaken activities]{.mark} that better position it [to
produce]{.mark} a [nuc]{.mark}lear device]{.underline}**, if it chooses
to do so," the report said.

Under the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, negotiated by the United States and
five other world powers plus the European Union, Iran agreed to accept
severe curbs on its nuclear program, including tight limits on the
amount of enriched uranium it could possess, as well as intrusive
monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based
nuclear watchdog.

But after Trump's withdrawal from the deal, **[[Iran threw off]{.mark}
most of its [restraints]{.mark} and began [producing]{.mark} enriched
[uranium]{.mark} at an ever [faster]{.mark} rate]{.underline}**,
according to U.S. and IAEA assessments.

Most worryingly**[, [Iran]{.mark} last year began [stockpiling]{.mark} a
form of highly enriched uranium that is close to weapons
grade,]{.underline}** according to confidential IAEA reports. **[U.S.
officials [confirm]{.mark} that [Iran]{.mark} could use this fuel to
[create]{.mark} a [bomb's]{.mark} worth of weapons-grade uranium
[in]{.mark} as little as a [few days]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if it
chooses to do so.

Iran would need additional time --- a few months or even a year or more
--- to master the technology to build a reliable nuclear warhead that
could be delivered by one of its ballistic missiles, officials and
experts said.

The next step that U.S. officials and regional diplomats are watching
will be Israel's response to Iran's missile attack. Iranian officials
have already warned that an Israeli response will be met with attacks on
energy infrastructure, without specifying where. Iranian allies in Iraq
have made similar threats.

"If the energy war begins, the world will lose 12 million barrels of oil
per day. Either everyone will enjoy the blessings of energy, or everyone
will be deprived," said Abu Ali al-Askari, of the powerful
Iranian-allied militia Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq.

Several current and former U.S. officials expressed concerns that Israel
may seize on an opportunity to attack Iran's uranium enrichment
facilities as retaliation for this week's missile strike. But whether
Israeli bombs could penetrate Iran's most deeply buried uranium plants
is unclear, the officials and weapons experts said. Much of Iran's
highly enriched uranium, they said, is made at its Fordow enrichment
plant, which was built inside tunnels dug into a mountain near the city
of Qom.

"It is highly likely that this time Israelis will target Iranian nuclear
facilities, especially if they believe **[[Iran]{.mark} has already
[resumed nuc]{.mark}lear [weaponization]{.mark}
[work]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Gregory Koblentz, an associate
professor and nonproliferation expert at George Mason University's Schar
School of Policy and Government. Koblentz said Israel's attacks against
Hezbollah in recent weeks were partly intended to neutralize the group's
vast rocket and missile forces, which were "widely seen as Iran's
insurance policy against an Israeli attack on their nuclear facilities."

#### They can build a bomb quickly

international relations scholar. \[Phillip, Jun 23, "Real success for

It will be many weeks --- **[years, in fact --- before we know if
Saturday's [US strikes]{.mark} on Iran were "very
successful]{.underline}**," as President Donald Trump proclaimed hours
after the bombs fell. The bombs hit their targets and the strikes may
have set back Iran's nuclear programme for months or even years. But
that is a **[[far]{.mark} cry [from]{.mark} a guaranteed
"[success]{.mark}." ]{.underline}**

The shortest-term questions are whether and for how long the underground
enrichment site at Fordow was genuinely put out of business and how much
of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium was actually destroyed.
Prior to the strikes, **[[Iran]{.mark} had over 400kg of
[HEU]{.mark}]{.underline}**, probably held in relatively small canisters
and potentially **[[disbursed around]{.mark} the [country]{.mark} at
underground sites]{.underline}**. **[[If]{.mark} even a [small
part]{.mark} of that material [survived]{.mark} the attack,
[Iran]{.mark} today still [has enough]{.mark} fissile material [for
several nuc]{.mark}lear bomb[s]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

Over the longer term, the main issue will be the effect the strikes have
on Iran's nuclear ambitions. The best-case scenario would be that Iran
realises the decades-long enterprise of seeking a nuclear weapons option
was catastrophically counter-productive. But **[[Iran]{.mark}ian leaders
are more likely to [draw]{.mark} the [conclusion]{.mark} that [only
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s can protect]{.mark} them]{.underline}** and
fairly soon **[resume the process of seeking to produce
them]{.underline}** --- much as Saddam Hussein did after Israel bombed
his incipient nuclear programme in 1981. Iran is a country of over 90mn
people, three times the size of France, with **[[extensive
nuclear]{.mark} knowhow that is now [likely]{.mark} to [abandon]{.mark}
its [non-prolif]{.mark}eration [commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
refuse to allow inspections. It could thus easily resume nuclear
activities unless the US and Israel are willing to bomb it over and over
again.

The key to making the mission a longer-term success will be avoiding
near-term military escalation that could draw the US further into the
war and make a renewed **[[Iranian nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
programme [more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Iran's Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had threatened the US with "irreparable damage"
if Washington entered the war and has already fired missiles at Israel
and a US base in Qatar in response. But his military options are
limited. Iran's proxy network has been degraded, its long-range
ballistic missile force significantly depleted, and its own air defences
destroyed, leaving it vulnerable to US or Israeli counter-attacks. 

**[Iran also has mines and naval assets that could temporarily close the
Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}**, imposing pain on the west by driving up
oil prices. But an overly aggressive response would almost surely invite
the powerful US retaliation that Trump has threatened. The regime's main
goal is to hold on to power, which is why **[it [sought]{.mark} a
potential [nuclear deterrent]{.mark} in the first place]{.underline}**.
Responding in a way that draws the US further into the war could
threaten the regime even more than losing its nuclear programme. 

It is hard to imagine Iran not responding to an American attack on its
prized nuclear facilities. It may fire more ballistic missiles at Israel
or US bases, urge its proxies in Yemen, Iraq and Syria to launch some
missiles or drones at US or Israeli targets, and perhaps try to sink or
capture an oil tanker, to demonstrate seriousness and preserve some
credibility with its public. But if it is smart it will calibrate that
response in a way designed to avoid all-out escalation, just as it did
last October when Israel conducted strikes on Iranian military sites,
and Iran seethed and blustered but chose not to escalate further because
its options were so bad. 

Of course, Iran may also opt for the opposite strategy of deliberately
killing Americans and drawing the US further in, hoping that the
American appetite for another costly war in the Middle East is limited,
and that Trump's Maga base will rise up in opposition if the price in
blood and treasure starts to rise. 

Israel goes to war with Iran

Trump himself has a huge interest in avoiding the latter scenario and
can help to do so by sending the right signals to Tehran. Some will
advise him that the only way to eliminate the Iranian nuclear option is
to eliminate the regime but that would be the surest way to drag the US
further into war. 

Instead, Trump should take regime change off the table and make it clear
to Iran's leaders that they will pay an enormous price for retaliating
against the US, but that de-escalation and even co-operation is still
possible. If the Iranian leadership believes that "calling it" now could
preserve their rule, and maybe even pave the way for sanctions relief
down the road, they might just do it given how bad their other options
are. 

**[Trump's strikes on Iran were an enormous and unnecessary
gamble]{.underline}**. But turning them into an actual success will
depend on getting the momentous decisions of the next few days right.

For a third time in four decades, **[warplanes have tried to bomb a
Middle Eastern nuclear program into submission]{.underline}**. The most
recent attempt began with an Israeli air campaign against Iran on June
13. Then, in the early morning hours of June 22, seven U.S. Air Force
B-2 stealth bombers unleashed 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator
bombs on Iran's most heavily fortified nuclear sites. The United States'
primary targets were the deeply buried enrichment facilities at Fordow
and Natanz, as well as a nuclear technology center at Isfahan.

**[[Washington declared the mission]{.underline}]{.mark}**, called
Operation Midnight Hammer, **[a]{.underline}** resounding
**[[success]{.underline}]{.mark}**; President Donald Trump said the
facilities had been "completely and totally obliterated." **[[But the
reality is far less certain]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[The]{.underline}** International Atomic Energy Agency
(**[IAEA]{.underline}**), the intergovernmental body that assesses
compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, **[was barred from
going within about 40 miles of the affected facilities]{.underline}**
and has been unable to check the extent of the damage to the underground
halls at Fordow and Natanz. The U.S. Department of Defense later
softened Trump's claims about the scale of the destruction and conceded
that it did not know the whereabouts of Iran's stockpile of
near-bomb-grade uranium.

Indeed, **[[there is strong]{.underline}]{.mark}** circumstantial
**[[evidence]{.mark} that before the American bombs fell,
[Tehran]{.mark} had [evacuated nuclear materials]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
as well as advanced centrifuge assemblies used to enrich uranium, stored
at the target sites. **[Commercial [satellite imagery showed]{.mark}
significant [truck activity at]{.mark} the [Fordow]{.mark} site in the
days preceding the]{.underline}** June 22 **[attack]{.underline}**.
According to information Iranian regulatory authorities gave to the
IAEA, after the bombing there was no measured increase in radiation
levels in areas surrounding the targeted facilities, indicating that the
strikes probably failed to destroy uranium stocks. In fact, **[[it is
likely that Iran still possesses]{.underline}]{.mark}** much or even
**[[all of its pre-strike stockpile]{.underline}]{.mark}** of highly
enriched uranium---**[[enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by some estimates,
**[[to build]{.underline}]{.mark}** as many as **[[ten nuclear
bombs]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

But **[[even if the bombing campaigns did wreak substantial
damage]{.mark} on Iranian nuclear sites]{.underline}**, history shows
that [**[shattering surface infrastructure]{.underline}** **[rarely
yields lasting security]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [**[Strikes may set back
an emerging nuclear state's capabilities]{.underline}**, **[but they
also tend to intensify that state's nuclear
aspirations]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** **[When it comes
to Iran]{.underline}**, the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration, like
Israel before it, **[appears to be caught up in the "smart-bomb
trap"]{.underline}**---a mistaken confidence in the power of precision
weapons to stunt nuclear breakout or even provoke regime collapse. The
more plausible reality is that **[[Operation Midnight Hammer has merely

On June 22, U.S. President Donald Trump asked, "\[I\]f the current
Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be
a Regime change???" That comment came amid an extensive Israeli military
campaign that, although ostensibly aimed at rolling back Iran's nuclear
program, was also clearly aimed at weakening and perhaps even
collapsing the regime. Today, the fragile cease-fire between Israel and
Iran has dampened discussion of this possibility, but there is reason to
think it may reemerge, or that other factors may contribute to the fall
of the Iranian government.

For decades, **[the primary international concern about Iran's nuclear
program has been how Tehran could use its nuclear materials,
technologies, and expertise to produce nuclear weapons]{.underline}**.
But **[if the Islamic Republic were to suddenly collapse, preventing
these resources from falling into the wrong hands would be a more
pressing concern.]{.underline}**

Though there has been a heated debate over the extent of the damage
caused by U.S. and Israeli strikes, the fact is that Iran's nuclear
infrastructure has not been totally destroyed. **[[Iran still
has]{.mark} [uranium mining capabilities]{.mark} and [nuclear power
and]{.mark} research [reactors]{.mark}, as well as whatever material or
technology could be salvaged from damaged enrichment
sites]{.underline}**, including Natanz and Fordow. Most importantly,
**[[Iran still]{.mark} ]{.underline}**likely
**[[possesses]{.underline}]{.mark}** some if not all of its **[roughly
8,000 kilograms of enriched uranium, including at least 400 kilograms of
60 percent enriched uranium---[enough for 10 nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if further enriched to weapons grade.
Iran also likely retains a large stockpile of advanced centrifuges and
centrifuge parts and potentially specialized equipment to make those
machines, as well as documents and equipment associated with its former
nuclear weapons program. **[[There are also]{.mark} likely hundreds if
not [thousands of scientists]{.mark} in Iran [who possess critical
nuclear know how, including how to]{.mark} operate centrifuges and
[build weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In 2018, Mossad's exfiltration of
hidden documentation reaffirmed the extensive work Iran did to develop
the technologies and processes needed for nuclear weapons.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) did not have access to
Iran's centrifuge stockpiles and manufacturing capabilities for years
before the recent U.S. strike, and inspectors have not had access to any
Iranian nuclear sites since June 13. With the onset of bombing by
Israel, if not before, **[Iran likely hid much of this material and
equipment in multiple secure locations. The resulting lack of a clear
baseline will make it much harder for the international community to
know whether any material or technology has been lost or
stolen]{.underline}**. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi has
been explicit about losing "continuity of knowledge" that had been built
up painstakingly over the last decade. On July 2, Iran also announced
that, consistent with a new law, it was suspending its cooperation with
the IAEA.

Experts know little about Iran's nuclear security practices, but the
**[measures necessary to keep nuclear materials and sensitive equipment
within state control are typically vast.]{.underline}** They include
physical protection measures (e.g., guns, gates, and guards), methods
for controlling and accounting for nuclear material produced, and
ideally, programs that mitigate the risk of insider theft and espionage.
But sustaining this system requires a functioning government. Guards and
scientists will not show up if they are not paid or if chaos and
violence prevent them from getting to work safely. If the current
government collapses, it is entirely plausible that Iran's nuclear
security enterprise will collapse with it.

The most concerning matter in that scenario would be the fate of the
highly enriched uranium (HEU). Even though it is not technically
weapons-grade uranium (usually defined as uranium enriched to at least
90 percent**[), [Iran's]{.mark} 60 percent enriched [uranium could be
used to fashion a]{.mark} crude [nuclear device]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
As producing this material is the most difficult step in making a
nuclear weapon, it would be extremely attractive to any state or
nonstate actor interested in obtaining a nuclear bomb. The 400 kilograms
of HEU in Iran is roughly the weight of 20 water cooler bottles and is
stored in canisters that could be fairly easily loaded onto a truck. The
current location of Iran's HEU is unclear, leaving the international
community with a difficult search for it should the regime fall.

**[Nuclear expertise is also valuable]{.underline}**.
**[[Iranian]{.mark} nuclear [scientists have over two decades of
experience]{.mark} [building]{.mark}, testing, and operating
centrifuges---[critical tech]{.mark}nologies for producing material for
a bomb]{.underline}**. In the years since the United States withdrew
from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, those scientists have also
honed their skills producing uranium metal, an activity directly
applicable to building a nuclear device. Other Iranian
**[researchers have reportedly engaged in research and experiments with
certain explosion systems and neutron
initiators]{.underline}**---important steps to building a bomb. Israel
has killed some of those personnel but almost certainly not all of them.
These individuals would be very attractive to a terrorist organization
or a state interested in creating a nuclear bomb.

Given the lack of understanding about Iran's remaining materials and
capabilities, **[the inevitable chaos that would accompany [any regime
change could present the most serious nuclear security challenge since
the fall of the Soviet Union]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The nature of the
problem would be far more acute than, say, in Iraq after the fall of the
regime in 2003, the end of Qaddafi's government in Libya in 2011, or the
fall of the Assad regime in Syria in 2024. In Libya, for example, the
central nuclear security challenge was that Qaddafi had stored tons of
yellowcake in a warehouse in a small town on the edge of the Sahara
Desert; that yellowcake would require considerably more effort to turn
into a weapon than the HEU in Iran.

How should Washington respond if faced with this nuclear security
crisis? Without guards or international inspectors on the ground,
Washington may have to rely on its own intelligence capabilities and
those of its allies to determine the whereabouts of Iran's nuclear
material and assess its vulnerability. Washington and its partners
should begin thinking through options now for seizing any material at
high risk of theft, including with U.S. or allied personnel. Such an
option would not be risk-free, and the ability to carry it out would
depend on a range of other factors, but it must stay on the table.

Governments around the world should consider sharing information and
alerting a nascent Iranian government if it detects acute security
vulnerabilities to sensitive nuclear material. And it should do so
regardless of questions about the validity of that government, or how
democratic or pro-U.S. it is. The risks of a terrorist acquiring a
nuclear weapon are simply too great.

The international community should also ask any new Iranian government
to rebuild relations with the IAEA, resume inspections of Iran's nuclear
sites unimpeded, and dedicate personnel to ensure Iran's key facilities
remain secure. Given the IAEA's extensive history of monitoring Iran's
program and its ability to operate in dangerous environments, such as
during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the agency could play a critical
role.

With the fall of the Soviet Union, U.S. Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar
developed a plan known today as the Cooperative Threat Reduction
program (CTR) that helped secure nuclear weapons and facilities in close
cooperation with Russia and former Soviet states. This program
immediately implemented a series of upgrades to deal with the most
glaring security issues, such as hardening facilities and installing
equipment to account for all nuclear materials at a particular site.

Once a new Iranian government is in place, Washington and its partners
should consider a similar effort to make Iran's nuclear program as
secure and proliferation-resistant as possible. One key part of this
would be finding work for Iranian scientists who may be unemployed due
to nuclear downsizing. The CTR's work was aided by the fact that Soviet
scientists and engineers, as stewards of a prestigious and successful
nuclear weapons program, felt a great responsibility to manage their
materials and know-how. Iranian scientists may not have the same
motivation, so some additional incentives might be necessary. Depending
on the orientation of Iran's new government, these could include
implementing projects to help grow and modernize Iran's civil nuclear
program in line with strong nonproliferation standards or assisting Iran
with filling any nuclear security gaps. China's role in modernizing the
Arak reactor as part of the Iran nuclear deal---although left incomplete
due to the U.S. withdrawal and subsequent deterioration of that
deal---shows how other countries can also play a role.

**[[The fall of the Iranian government]{.mark} may or may not mitigate
the long-term challenge posed by Iran's nuclear program, but it would
certainly [pose a]{.mark} more [immediate nuclear security
ris]{.mark}k.]{.underline}** The U.S. and the international community
will have a lot of important issues on their plate---preventing a
nuclear catastrophe needs to be at the top.

**[[Iran retains]{.mark} the technical [capability to produce
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [despite]{.mark} devastating Israeli
[strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}** on its nuclear infrastructure in June
2025, though its timeline has been temporarily extended. The
**[attacks]{.underline}** represent a significant tactical success but
**[fall short of eliminating Iran\'s nuclear threat]{.underline}**.

As of May 2025, **[[Iran possesses 408.6 kg of 60% enriched
uranium]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[sufficient]{.mark} material [for
nine]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** if further enriched
to weapons-grade levels. This represents a **[50% increase since
February and demonstrates Iran\'s accelerated production capacity
despite international pressure]{.underline}**. The Islamic Republic
maintains **[9,247.6 kg of total enriched uranium across all enrichment
levels]{.underline}**, dramatically exceeding the 202.8 kg limit under
the abandoned nuclear deal.

Iran\'s enrichment infrastructure had reached unprecedented capacity
before the strikes, with approximately **[18,000 operating centrifuges
producing 35-40 kg of 60% enriched uranium monthly]{.underline}**. This
production rate meant **[[Iran could]{.mark} theoretically [produce
enough weapons-grade uranium for its first nuc]{.mark}lear weapon
[within one week]{.mark} if it chose to break out.]{.underline}**

Operation Rising Lion on June 13, 2025, marked Israel\'s largest
military action against Iran since the 1980s Iran-Iraq War. The strikes
achieved several critical objectives:

Complete destruction of Natanz\'s above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment
Plant, Iran\'s only surface facility producing 60% enriched uranium

Electrical infrastructure devastation at Natanz, knocking out power to
underground centrifuge halls and potentially damaging thousands of
centrifuges through uncontrolled shutdown

Key personnel eliminated, including nuclear scientists and senior
military commanders

Supply chain disruption across multiple nuclear facilities

However, the strikes faced significant limitations. The deeply buried
Fordow facility, housing Iran\'s most advanced centrifuges, appears
largely intact. Military experts note that only the US military\'s
30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator could reliably destroy such
hardened underground facilities -- munitions Israel does not possess.

US intelligence dramatically revised its assessment in 2024, removing
longstanding assertions that Iran was not pursuing nuclear weapons
development. Current intelligence indicates Iran has \"undertaken
activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device\"
including computer modelling and metallurgy experiments at civilian
research institutes.

The Institute for Science and International Security assessed that even
before the strikes, Iran could produce weapons-grade uranium for
multiple weapons within weeks. Post-strike analysis suggests Iran
retains the capability to produce its first quantity of weapons-grade
uranium at Fordow in 2-3 days once operations resume.

Iran\'s nuclear weapons programme builds on the AMAD Plan (1999-2003),
which established critical technical foundations including warhead
designs, implosion technology, and missile integration capabilities.
Intelligence reports from 2024 suggest **[Iranian [scientists are
exploring \"crude\" nuclear weapon]{.mark} designs that could be
[completed within six months]{.mark} rather than the 1-2 years typically
required for missile-deliverable warheads.]{.underline}**

Trump's statement that **[Iran is "very close" to a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}** is vague, and depends on how this is measured**[.
[Experts told]{.mark}]{.underline}** FactCheck.org **[[it would take
Iran a week]{.mark} or so [to produce weapons-grade
uranium]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if it chose to do so, but it would take
several months or more to turn that uranium into a nuclear weapon.

Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a
nonpartisan organization that provides analysis on arms control and
national security issues, explained in a phone interview that there are
"two or three ways to define how close to a nuclear weapon a country
is."

**[One is what's known as the "[breakout]{.mark}" time]{.underline}**.
"There's broad consensus among experts that **[Iran's breakout time ---
[defined as the time needed to produce]{.mark} enough [weapons-grade
uranium]{.mark} for one bomb --- [is currently at]{.mark} roughly [one
week or less]{.mark} [given]{.mark} its [stockpile of highly enriched
uranium]{.mark} and advanced centrifuge capacity]{.underline}**," Shawn
Rostker, research analyst at the nonpartisan Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation, said in an email, noting that there's uncertainty now
about what impact Israel's attacks have had on Iran's nuclear
facilities.

**[[Abandoning nuclear diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** at this point
**[[will let Iran off the hook]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[While the
Trump administration may feel a strong impetus to signal that US
military action was singularly effective]{.underline}** in stopping the
program, [**[permitting opacity on Iran's nuclear program now
would]{.underline}** **[undo]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[whatever
[benefit]{.mark} the United States hoped to gain]{.underline}**.
Eliminating the potential for Iran to "hide and bide" behind a temporary
truce, negotiating process, and even an interim agreement---and then
surprise the world with a nuclear weapon in the near- to
mid-term---needs to be the focus of current negotiations.

**[[The ability for Iran to]{.underline}]{.mark}** dig deeper and
**[[resume]{.underline}]{.mark}** past **[[nuclear weapons work out of
reach of]{.underline}]{.mark}** US "[**[bunker buster]{.underline}**"
**[bombs]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} demonstrably
**[[clear]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[as is the potential to move toward
a weapon quickly based on existing capacity and know-how]{.underline}**.
**[[That leaves diplomacy as the only practical answer to decisively
heading off an Iranian bomb]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, **[Iran may
already possess such a protected location at Isfahan]{.underline}**,
where tunnels may exist that are far deeper than those bombed by US B-2
bombers at Fordow and Natanz, and are out of reach of conventional
weapons, foreign government experts, and international inspectors.

Beyond the classic focus on enrichment capacity and stockpiled uranium,
**[US negotiators should also ensure that IAEA inspectors can detect any
weaponization-related activities]{.underline}** following the road paved
by negotiators of the JCPOA. (Specifically, Section T of Annex 1 of the
JCPOA contains commitments on the part of Iran not to engage in nuclear
weaponization activities.) **[This can inform future pressure campaigns
on the diplomatic front]{.underline}**, to **[urge
compliance]{.underline}**, **[deter Iran's withdrawal from
the]{.underline}** Nuclear
**[N]{.underline}**on-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty, and any future attempts to keep IAEA
inspectors away from undeclared nuclear sites. Iran turned off and on
access for the IAEA as part of its negotiating approach with the West;
currently, hostile Iran-IAEA relations may make sufficient monitoring
and verification an incredibly difficult issue to negotiate.

[**[Absent a serious diplomatic approach]{.underline}**, **[the
U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[may
face a more serious crisis]{.mark} down the road]{.underline}**. **[[The
US and Israeli militaries may need to play a more regular game of cat
and mouse with an Iranian nuclear program that goes underground and
undetected]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, attacks by Israel
against Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 set back Iraq's
development of a nuclear program, but they also led Saddam Hussein to
drive his weapons of mass destruction programs underground, pursuing
multiple pathways to such weapons. Saddam halted such work following the
first Gulf War to comply with UN resolutions. But questions regarding
Iraq's program were left unresolved, leading to further conflict, at
great cost to the United States and allies. Certainly, this is a future
the Trump administration should seek to avoid with Iran.

However, **[[if unsuccessful on the diplomatic
track]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a US administration committed to avoiding
intervention in [**[the Middle East]{.underline}** **[may end
up]{.underline}**]{.mark} avoiding another Iraq debacle but **[[facing
another nuclear breakout à la North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[If
regional tensions lead to further nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**,
[**[Iran may not be the only new entrant to the nuclear weapons
club]{.underline}**, **[but could be followed quickly
by]{.underline}**]{.mark} its neighbors, the first of which would be
[**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Iranian nuclear proliferation will spill across the entire Middle East

(Ankit Panda, 6-29-2025, "Iran attack could be the death knell for

The United States' decision to entangle itself in Israel's war against
Iran comes at a fateful moment for the global nuclear order. Contrary to
US President Donald Trump's celebration of a "spectacular military
success," the **[[prospects of]{.mark} an indefinitely [non-nuclear
Iran]{.mark} have [diminished significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
with **[[dire implications for halting]{.mark} the [spread of nuclear
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

As tactically impressive as the US-Israeli campaign may be, **[[Iran's
nuclear ambitions]{.mark} have [not]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as US
officials suggested, **[[been "obliterated]{.mark}".]{.underline}** The
fate of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, its most valuable
asset should it decide to weaponise, and components of advanced
centrifuges remain unaccounted for. Despite Israeli assassinations of
key scientists, **[Iran continues to possess a significant knowledge
base that could aid its weaponisation]{.underline}**.

The world is experiencing an era of nuclear flux; since 2020, we've seen
**[[Russia]{.mark} invade non-nuclear Ukraine [backed by nuclear
threat]{.mark}-making]{.underline}**, **[[China]{.mark} embark on a
[major build-up of]{.mark} its [nuclear forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[India and Pakistan engage in the most significant violence below the
nuclear threshold in decades]{.underline}**, **[while]{.underline}**
discomfited **[[US allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- from Warsaw to
Seoul --- are **[increasingly [considering]{.mark} their own [nuclear
options]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This new era has thrust nuclear weapons
back to the centre of global statecraft.

While military action against nuclear facilities has a long history,
there is no precise precedent for this month's events.
**[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- which is the only country in the
Middle East to have nuclear weapons, but does not declare its programme
and **[is [not]{.mark} a [signatory to]{.mark} the Non-Proliferation
Treaty ([NPT]{.mark})]{.underline}** --- **[took [it]{.mark} upon itself
to [bomb]{.mark} several [nuclear facilities]{.mark} under international
safeguards]{.underline}** on the territory of an NPT party
**[[and]{.mark} successfully [recruited the]{.mark} [US to
strike]{.mark} the [targets]{.mark} it couldn't take out
itself.]{.underline}**

Israel has long alleged that Iran was undertaking weaponisation
activities, but US intelligence has not supported this conclusion.
Iran's well-documented pre-2003 activities on weaponisation precipitated
this crisis, but **[[keeping Iran]{.mark} [within the
NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- and compliant with the verification and
monitoring requirements that follow --- **[is
[critical]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Iran's leaders]{.underline}** now have several options, but a chief
**[consideration will be the matter of whether to remain in the NPT or
to]{.underline}** become only the second state, after North Korea, **[to
have signed, ratified, and exited that agreement]{.underline}** ---
possibly **[to then test a nuclear explosive]{.underline}**, as North
Korea did in 2006.

An **[[Iranian withdrawal]{.mark} is more [likely]{.mark} than
not]{.underline}** at this point --- with potential **[[ripple effects
across the]{.mark} broader [Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}** and a
heightened probability of an Iranian bomb. **[[Iran]{.mark} has already
passed a law]{.underline}**, approved by the country's powerful Guardian
Council, **[[call]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark} the [total cessation]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [co-operation with]{.mark} the [I]{.mark}nternational
[A]{.mark}tomic [E]{.mark}nergy [A]{.mark}gency.]{.underline}** This
could presage a withdrawal from the NPT, which mandates such
co-operation. With an exit from the NPT, **[Iran]{.underline}** would no
longer have an active safeguards agreement with the IAEA, **[limiting
transparency as it seeks to rebuild its nuclear
programme]{.underline}**.

The actual consequences of such a development would be devastating. For
instance, **[Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has repeatedly
promised that his country would seek a nuclear weapon if Iran were to do
so, openly or covertly. Others may follow.]{.underline}**

**[Reversing this damage to the non-proliferation order will be
difficult, and there is no panacea.]{.underline}** There are, however,
steps that leaders who value an orderly, if imperfect, system of
non-proliferation can take.

The lowest-hanging fruit would be for strong supporters of the NPT ---
particularly in Europe --- to align their rhetoric towards Israel with
their far more consequential interests in global non-proliferation.
**[The [UK]{.mark}, [Germany and France]{.mark}, for instance, have
[failed to call]{.mark} a [spade]{.mark} a spade [when it comes
to]{.mark} the [non-proliferation]{.mark} implications]{.underline}** of
June 2025's events **[[and couched]{.mark} their [support]{.mark} [for
Israel's decision]{.mark} [to launch]{.mark} its [war]{.mark} in the
language of self-defence.]{.underline}** This is a mistake.

European states should follow the example of Japan, which plainly
criticised Israel and appreciated the harm this brings to the
non-proliferation order. This is especially true at a moment when **[the
[US]{.mark} seems [unable and unwilling]{.mark} [to steward]{.mark} the
[institutions]{.mark} it once championed]{.underline}**, including the
NPT itself.

While Trump and other senior US officials have vaguely alluded to
non-proliferation principles in justifying American entanglement in this
war, that is not their chief concern. This moment will require others to
stand for a **[[fraying global nuclear order]{.mark} before the
remaining pillars collapse entirely]{.underline}**.

before. But **[[circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark}** have

prevent Iran from getting there, which kept Israel more evenly divided
on the necessity of military action. Now, given technical advancements
made since the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran may be only a few months from its
goal. Mr. Biden said in June that Iran would "never get a nuclear weapon

**[who]{.underline}** rightly **[[worry]{.underline}]{.mark}** that

the alternative --- **[[striking Iran]{.mark}'s nuclear facilities with

Iran could]{.mark}, in my view, [prove catastrophic]{.mark}, haunting us
for generations in that part of the world,"]{.underline} he added.
Gates, the defense secretary under both Presidents George W. Bush and
Barack Obama, was not alone. There is a reason that the United States
has not gone to war with Iran before. The overwhelming consensus of
military and intelligence officials and experts has been that doing so
would be a disaster. "President George W. Bush's administration
concluded that a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities would be a
bad idea --- and would only make it harder to prevent Iran from going
nuclear in the future," former CIA Director Michael Hayden said, also in
2012. "After you've dropped those bombs on those hardened facilities,
what happens next?" former Central Command chief Anthony Zinni asked in
2009. There could be catastrophic economic, political and military
consequences on a global scale. The nuclear consequences alone should
terrify us. It is possible that [U[.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites,
coupled with Israel's sustained bombing of Iranian political and
economic targets, could cause]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}ian government [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
collapse, or agree to President Donald Trump's demand for "unconditional
surrender." But it is more likely that Iran could [[race to build
nuclear weapons. It could produce enough uranium for the cores of 10
bombs in a matter of days]{.underline}.]{.mark} It is unknown how long
it would then take to turn the uranium into metal, shape it into weapons
and then assemble it into one or more devices. U.S. intelligence
agencies have assessed that it would take a year or more, but Iran could
find shortcuts and do it as little as three to five weeks --- as China
did in 1964. [[Iran]{.mark} does not have to create a modern,
sophisticated [warhead]{.mark} that could fit on the tip of a missile.
It [could]{.mark} assemble a crude device that [resemble]{.mark}s the
bomb the United States used to destroy [Hiroshima]{.mark} 80 years
ago.]{.underline} It could put that bomb in a plane, a truck or the
belly of a cargo ship and smuggle it into the territory of a U.S. ally,
or America itself. [[Iran might]{.mark} also [explode a bomb in its own
deserts, demonstrating that it has now become a nuclear power, and
threaten to use it unless Israel and the United States stop their
attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} This would be in addition to other
potential actions that officials and experts have long predicted, such
as closing the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off one-fifth of the world's
oil supplies and triggering a global recession; attacking U.S. troops in
the region; and terrorist attacks on U.S. interests and economic targets
around the world. It is worth remembering that the nuclear risks do not
just stem from Iran. Of the three countries involved in this war, two
are nuclear-armed nations. If Iranian missiles were to kill hundreds in
Tel Aviv, would Israel decide to launch its nuclear-tipped missiles on
Tehran? Or if the Iranians sink one of the three U.S. carriers now
heading to the region, would Trump cross the nuclear line? We have been
fortunate that no nation has used a nuclear weapon in combat in 80
years. This war could end that streak. [[Even if the attacks on Iran
succeed]{.underline}]{.mark} --- if Iranian centrifuges and uranium
stocks are destroyed --- [[nuclear risks will
multiply.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Nations]{.underline}]{.mark} around the
world [[may conclude]{.underline} **[that]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[only
[a nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [can save them from conventional military
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Right now, our own European allies worry
that [[Trump's retreat from]{.mark} fully supporting [Ukraine]{.mark}
--- and budding alliance with Russia --- [means]{.mark} that if the U.S.
nuclear umbrella no longer protects them, then [they had better build
their own]{.mark}.]{.underline} War with Iran may also be the final blow
to the already tottering nuclear nonproliferation regime. President
George W. Bush began weakening the nuclear guardrails when he withdrew
from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 (promising a national
missile shield that never materialized), and withdrawing from the 1994
agreement that had blocked North Korea's nuclear program (now fully
developed, including missiles that can hit the United States). Trump and
Russian President Vladimir Putin accelerated the disintegration of
global nuclear norms by withdrawing from three other agreements. [[The
sole remaining treaty limiting nuclear arms]{.mark}, the New START
treaty, [expires next year with no replacement in sight]{.mark}. This
war could cause [many countries in Europe and Asia]{.mark} to
[conclude]{.mark} that [they must pull out]{.mark} of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, [ending five decades of nuclear
restraint]{.mark}. [We would be **plunged back into the nuclear
anarchy** of the 1950s and 1960s when **dozens of countries had nuclear
weapons programs**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

//PK

Until now, of course, the Iranians have forsworn embarking on an actual
bomb program, a point serially reiterated by US intelligence over the
years and recently reiterated, albeit vainly, by Director of National
Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Instead, they built up their uranium
enrichment industry as a demonstration that they could build a nuclear
bomb if they wanted to, and as a bargaining chip for the relaxation of
sanctions. This worked with Obama, but not with Trump, so now that
negotiations have yielded only bunker-busters, [[there is the]{.mark}
distinct [possibility that the Iranians might actually opt to build a
bomb or two. **If they do, others**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
neighborhood may **[[follow suit.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Prominent in that list would be** Saudi Arabia**]{.underline},
who]{.mark}se rulers [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} long [[expressed an
**intent to acquire nuclear weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} if and
**[[when Iran goes nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [(Israel's extensive
cache of nukes doesn't seem to bother them.)]{.underline} As Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS in 2018: "[If Iran develops a
nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible."]{.underline}
True to their habit of getting others to do the work, the [**[Saudis
have poured money into other people's bomb-making programs]{.mark}** in
exchange for commitments to make some of the resultant products
available when asked. Such was the arrangement with Saddam
Hussein]{.underline} back in the 1980s. According to Mohammed al
Khilewi, a Saudi deputy ambassador to the UN who sought asylum in the US
in 1994, the [[Saudi contribution to the program amounted to \$5
billion.]{.underline}]{.mark} Although US officials downplayed Khilewi's
well-documented assertions, the late James E. Akins, a former US
ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who remained close to the country's rulers,
[previously confirmed to me that there had indeed been such an agreement
and that the CIA had known all about it]{.underline}. Although Saddam's
bomb never appeared, [the Saudis, according to multiple sources, footed
much of the bill for the more successful Pakistani bomb program -- up to
60 percent of the cost by one estimate.]{.underline} "[[Saudi Arabia
provided **generous financial support to Pakistan** that enabled the
nuclear program to continue]{.mark},"]{.underline} Feroz Hassan Khan, a
veteran of the program, recounted in his book Eating Grass: The Making
of the Pakistani Bomb.

As with the Iraqi deal, the arrangement reportedly involved a quid pro
quo of Pakistani nukes being placed at the Saudis' disposal if
requested. According to a 2013 BBC Newsnight report by Mark Urban, Amos
Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, told a
conference in Sweden in September that year that **[[if Iran got the
bomb, "the Saudis will not wait one month. They already paid for the
bomb, they will go to Pakistan and bring what they need to
bring."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Urban also quoted an anonymous senior
Pakistani official as saying, **[["What did we think the Saudis were
giving us all that money for? It wasn't charity."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark} Pakistan-made [[bombs never
come]{.underline}]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia, [[the Saudis have already
done their bit to spread such weapons further
afield]{.underline}]{.mark}. A.Q. Khan, the scientist who headed the
Pakistani program, went on to export the Saudi-funded technology to the
[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}ns, who put it to good use in their
own weapons program. In turn, the Koreans have given lessons to others
who feel in need of a bomb. While the Iranians paid some attention to
the non-proliferation treaty, [[Pyongyang]{.underline}]{.mark}
determinedly [[avoided any]{.underline}]{.mark} such
[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}, kicking out monitors in 2002 and
avoiding diplomatic engagement on nuclear issues until they had their
deterrent up and running by 2018, at which point they became essentially
invulnerable. It is an instructive example that others will find
increasingly attractive.

#### And they have the capabilities---multiple warrants

game?"
https://www.unav.edu/web/global-affairs/in-pursuit-of-the-bomb-is-saudi-arabia-playing-the-nuclear-game-
//PK

The question of Saudi Arabia's nuclearisation received some attention in
2018, after fears over Iran's development of nuclear capabilities, and
more recently, following two announcements. Firstly, a rapprochement
attempt between Israel and Saudi Arabia, mediated by the United States,
in exchange for aid in nuclear enrichment programmes; and secondly, the
revelation that Saudi Arabia would build a new nuclear power plant. The
increasing likelihood that Saudi Arabia will develop nuclear
capabilities, whether through a deal with the United States and Israel
or an alternative agreement with China, would certainly destabilise the
Middle East and ensure the start of a regional arms race.

**Ambiguous facts and uncertain intentions**

[[The Saudi government has been rumoured to be in the process of
becoming a nuclear-capable state]{.underline}]{.mark} since at least the
early 2000s, [[when reports emerged stating that the government reached
a secret agreement with the nuclear-armed state of
Pakistan.]{.underline}]{.mark} In more recent times, Saudi Arabia has
[[acknowledged the existence of one small nuclear research unit
near]{.underline}]{.mark} the King Abdulaziz City for Science and
Technology ([[Riyadh]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[and announced plans to
develop additional nuclear plants.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, such
preparations are underway in the Eastern Province, a project for which
several countries, including China, have already started placing bids.

According to the Saudi Arabian government, all nuclearisation efforts
are for civilian purposes, with the country at the forefront of nuclear
energy development. While this is true, the [[push by Saudi Arabia to
create nuclear capabilities seems suspicious considering that it holds
some of the largest oil deposits in the world, meaning that energy
supplies are both abundant and secure.]{.underline}]{.mark} However, any
posturing must be interpreted considering public statements made by
Mohammed Bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler. In 2018 and more
recently, in 2023, Bin Salman stated that should Iran gain a nuclear
weapon, Saudi Arabia would attempt to do the same.

By attempting to reassure neighbours and partners, Saudi Arabia is
acting in the same way as other nations that started nuclear programmes,
at least in principle, for civilian purposes and ended up employing
nuclear weapons as a deterrent. The government has gone to some lengths
to argue that any nuclear programme would reduce reliance on oil
extraction and other non-renewable energy sources. Indeed, th[[e theory
that climate diversification is the driver of this shift loses its
credence when one considers that Mohammed Bin Salman has twice publicly
stated that the main aim of such a programme would be to counteract
Tehran.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Longstanding hostilities with Iran and regional leverages**

[[The possibility of Saudi Arabia becoming a nuclear power cannot be
extricated from the nation's fears about Iran's nuclear
programme]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite sanctions by the international
community, Iran has developed a programme which may be close to
producing military nuclear capabilities of its own.

Fears of such an event, with the implication of a nuclear arms race
across the Middle East, to a certain extent, died down with the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), whereby Iran agreed to comply with
international supervision of its programme. This agreement was rendered
useless in 2018 when the United States withdrew from the deal,
culminating in sanctions being reimposed and Iran no longer complying
with the treaty's terms.

It [[was within this context that Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman first
announced that Saudi Arabia would develop its nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, understood as the ability to gain a
nuclear weapon if Iran acquired the same capability. Shortly afterwards,
in 2019, Saudi Arabia's first nuclear reactor was unveiled by satellite
images.

The question of further steps in the quest for nuclearisation remained
purely within the realm of domestic policy until 2023, when the terms
for a possible Saudi-Israeli normalisation deal were unveiled. [[In
exchange for normalisation with Israel, the country wanted to both
expand its self-proclaimed civilian nuclear programme and build a
uranium enrichment plant.]{.underline}]{.mark} The US-brokered deal
offered technical assistance in the development of nuclear plants for
civilian purposes in exchange for Saudi recognition of Israel.

In spite of public posturing, the civilian aims of such a programme are
disputed, and it is most likely an attempt to both assuage US fears of a
nuclear arms race within the Middle East and enhance Saudi Arabia's
status as a responsible power broker in a region critical of Iran's
nuclear programme.

Saudi Arabia, Iran's main counterweight, cannot open itself up to the
same criticism Iran is under, as such behaviour would strain its ties
with neighbours. This, in turn, would open an opportunity for Iran to
resume its rhetoric against Saudi Arabia, leaving a timeframe within
which Saudi Arabia would be simultaneously under diplomatic stress and
lacking the technical capabilities to immediately develop a large-scale
nuclear programme.

The importance of this technical assistance cannot be understated, as
Saudi Arabia's technological know-how is limited to the small nuclear
facility in Riyadh. Considering the recent discovery of some limited
uranium resources within Saudi territory, which are usable as fuel for a
nuclear weapon, and the ample economic resources the country could
invest in such a project, it becomes evident that Saudi Arabia has both
the means and the willingness to become a nuclear state.

**The potential role of China: Beyond an economic association?**

Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip following Hamas's attack on the
7th of October has put the US-brokered deal on pause, but other paths to
nuclearisation exist. While the Israeli normalisation deal was the most
straightforward road to this goal, it is imperative not to forget that
other countries, such as China, would also be willing to aid Saudi
Arabia in developing their capabilities.

There has been a deepening of ties between Saudi Arabia and China,
manifested through diplomatic contacts between these two nations,
agreements to increase crude oil exports to China starting in 2024, and
a currency swap. The recent deal between the countries to establish a
currency swap is of special significance, as it would allow China and
Saudi Arabia to trade without employing the dollar or any other reserve
currency. This evasion of third-nation's currencies may prove especially
useless should the need to avoid sanctions on oil arise, as may well be
the case if Saudi Arabia, like Iran, comes under international
opprobrium for establishing a military nuclear programme.

Chinese companies have signed contracts to extract uranium reserves
within Saudi Arabia, and have further placed bids to build a new nuclear
reactor near the Saudi-Qatari border. When taken in conjunction, the
deepening ties between Saudi Arabia and China raise the possibility of
Saudi Arabia asking China, a nation with nuclear expertise, for
assistance in furthering their nuclearisation programme. In essence,
should the United States be unwilling to help, as may be the case now
that Saudi-Israeli normalisation seems unlikely, Saudi Arabia would
nonetheless have a path towards nuclearisation, which begs the question
of what such a development would mean for the Middle East.

**Predicting a bright future for an empowered Saudi Arabia**

The Hamas attack on Israel and this country's subsequent ground invasion
have led to a halt in the process of normalisation between Israel and
Saudi Arabia, meaning that collaboration on nuclearisation efforts now
seems unlikely. However, this temporary pause does not in any way mean
that a Saudi nuclear programme will become impossible. [[While
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Hamas' main backer, [[has gained
time]{.underline}]{.mark} by delaying the Saudi programme, [[Saudi
determination to gain the weapon has not
disappeared.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Saudi Arabia is in a strong position to achieve such
nuclearisation]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it holds ample economic and
natural resources, multiple international partnerships, and a definite
willingness to achieve nuclear capabilities. While the effect such a
development will have on the Middle East is unknown, [[it will
likely]{.underline}]{.mark} [[escalate tension between Iran and Saudi
Arabia, the two leading players in a region where proliferation is
increasingly probable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Saudi Arabia's Motive: Iran

There are three models for why states seek nuclear weapons: security,
domestic politics, and norms. The security model asserts that states
pursue nuclear weapons to deter the security threat posed by a
nuclear-armed adversary or a conventional military threat. In the
domestic political model, internal actors encourage nuclear pursuit for
budgetary gains, organizational status, or to secure support from
domestic constituencies that favor nuclear weaponization. Finally, the
norms model infers that states seek nuclear weapons as desirable symbols
of prestige. Mohammed bin Salman's warning suggests the
obvious---[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia['s]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
[interest]{.mark} is [driven]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the threat a
nuclear-armed [Iran]{.mark} would pose.]{.underline}

\<\<\<text condensed, none omitted\>\>\>

Iran has emerged as the chief nuclear threat to Saudi Arabia since the
mid-2000s. Saudi Arabia has never considered Iran's nuclear program as
purely civilian. Riyadh always assumed that Iran's ultimate goal was
nuclear armament. In 2011, Prince Turki Al-Faysal called for the Gulf
states to acquire "nuclear might" as a counterweight to Iran. The Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) did not assuage Saudi fears. In the
2015 agreement, Iran pledged not to produce highly enriched uranium or
plutonium in exchange for sanctions relief. Saudi leaders considered the
deal a betrayal because it left Iran's ability to build nuclear weapons
intact and the United States negotiated the JCPOA without consulting
them. Fear of Iran has grown with the progress of its nuclear
program. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stressed the threat a nuclear Iran
would pose. At the very least, Iran's nuclear weaponization would "upset
the traditional balance between the countries of the Gulf to Iran's
favor." Saudi Arabia worries that Iran could use its nuclear arsenal
to incite Saudi Shiites---a sizable minority that primarily resides in
the oil-rich eastern province---to revolt without fear of Saudi reprisal
against Iran. Iran could also expand its network of proxies more
aggressively or close the Straits of Hormuz to Saudi oil exports. Saudi
Arabia also presents numerous targets for conventional aggression waged
under Iran's prospective nuclear umbrella. Saudi Arabia worries that
"the Iranian nuclear bomb has only one objective, namely that of
dominance by a new Persian Empire over Asia and the Arab and Islamic
worlds." Saudi Arabia's fear of a nuclear-armed Iran is clear, and a
recent *Foreign Affairs *article came to the same conclusion: the main
motivation for Saudi Arabia's nuclear behavior is Iran. Saudi Arabia:
Nuclear HedgerSaudi Arabia has the characteristics of a nuclear hedger:
a state that lays the groundwork for the active pursuit of nuclear
weapons. Saudi Arabia has stated the conditions under which it would
pursue nuclear weapons. It already possesses dual-capable delivery
systems and seeks reactors to produce weapons-grade uranium. Its
inability to enrich nuclear material alone prevents Saudi Arabia from
gaining nuclear latency that it can rapidly convert into nuclear
weapons. Saudi Arabia is best categorized as an insurance hedger that
seeks to reduce the time needed to build a bomb. Regardless of the
categorization of Saudi Arabia's hedging, its interest in nuclear
weapons has entered a new, acute stage. Nuclear Strategies: Pathways To
the BombThere are three strategies Saudi Arabia could adopt if it did
seek the bomb: sheltered pursuit, sprinting, and hiding. The strategy of
sheltered pursuit describes a pathway to nuclear weapons that depends on
the support of a major power. In this strategy, a major power protects
the nuclear aspirant from rivals' efforts to interfere with its nuclear
pursuit. In this case, Riyadh would rely on the United States to provide
shelter and deter Iran. It is likely Saudi Arabia's preferred
pathway because it enables nuclear aspirants to pursue nuclear weapons
more efficiently and openly. Major power patronage can prevent military,
economic, and diplomatic counterproliferation actions. However, it is
unlikely that the United States would support Saudi Arabia's nuclear
pursuit. The United States prefers for its allies not to have nuclear
weapons so that escalation and nuclear use remain entirely within
Washington's purview. Further, Saudi Arabia would need reactors and gas
centrifuges to build nuclear weapons and there has been opposition from
Congress and Israel to a U.S.-Saudi nuclear energy deal. It is unlikely
Congress would approve of a deal without stringent proliferation
safeguards. Moreover, if the United States did grant Saudi Arabia those
facilities and technologies without a prohibition on enrichment, it
would set a precedent for other allies to demand similar privileges. 

**[\<\<\<resume paragraph\>\>\>]{.underline}**

[The "**[sprinting]{.mark}" [strategy]{.mark}** [describes]{.mark} an
[active]{.mark}, [rapid]{.mark}, and open [pursuit of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sprinting has historically been
successful with France, India, the PRC, the USSR, and the United States
all employing it. However, sprinting often requires immunity from
military and economic preventive action, such as sanctions or strikes on
nuclear facilities. Saudi Arabia is vulnerable to both Iranian military
countermeasures and a U.S. arms embargo. It also lacks the reactors and
equipment needed to sprint to the bomb.

[Although there are [countries]{.mark} that [could]{.mark} **[provide
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia** [with]{.mark} these
[tech]{.mark}nologies---the PRC, United States, France, Russia, and
South Korea among them]{.underline}---a lack of uranium enrichment
capabilities is currently the chief obstacle to a Saudi sprint to the
bomb. U.S. allies South Korea and France are unlikely to sell Saudi
Arabia nuclear reactors without a strict nonproliferation agreement.
Sanctions against Russia render it an unattractive partner for Saudi
Arabia. The PRC has close economic and military ties to Iran and
even designed an Iranian uranium-conversion facility. However, the
[[PRC]{.mark} has [**partnered** with Saudi]{.mark} Arabia
[on]{.mark} [uranium]{.mark} prospecting]{.underline}, brokered an
effort at Saudi-Iranian rapprochement in 2023,
and [[supplied Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [with]{.mark} dual-capable
**[ballistic missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Although the [PRC]{.mark}
might eventually balk at [providing]{.mark} [Saudi]{.mark}
[Arabia]{.mark} [with]{.mark} nuclear **[reactors]{.mark}** that can
**[produce]{.mark}** **[weapons-grade]{.mark}** nuclear
[material]{.mark}]{.underline}, it covets Saudi Arabian oil and has a
track record of nuclear partnership with the kingdom. Either way,
[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [considers]{.mark} the [PRC]{.mark} its **[best
bet]{.mark}** to secure nuclear reactors if the United States declines
to do so.]{.underline}

The strategy of 'hiding' differs from sprinting in that it privileges
secrecy over rapidity. Saudi Arabia is a good candidate for a hiding
strategy. [The **[international]{.mark} community**
[knows]{.mark} [little]{.mark} about **nuclear activity** within the
kingdom]{.underline}. Its secretive decision-making and secluded desert
areas that could house underground nuclear facilities would also aid a
hiding strategy. Nonetheless, Saudi Arabia still cannot enrich uranium
to weapons grade. Efforts to enlist outside help could alert others to
its nuclear weapons program. If Iran builds nuclear weapons first,
Mohammed bin Salman's prior statement would direct international
scrutiny toward Saudi Arabia's nuclear activities.  

Obstacles To The Bomb

Even if Saudi Arabia adopted an active pursuit strategy, it would
take years before it built a finished nuclear weapon. Saudi Arabia lacks
the dual-use technology needed to build weapons-grade nuclear material,
and nuclear warheads are difficult to construct. A Saudi Arabian nuclear
weapons program could also elicit reprisals from Iran. In 2019, the
Islamic Republic used its missile and drone capabilities to cripple a
Saudi oil processing facility. It could launch similar assaults on Saudi
Arabia's nuclear infrastructure. Furthermore, the United States might
levy sanctions on the Kingdom or offer Saudi Arabia its long sought
after formal defense relationship. Lengthy time frames and a need to
secure enrichment capabilities from abroad provide the United States
with the opportunity to preempt Saudi Arabia before it is too late. 

Why The United States Should Stop Saudi Arabia 

There are three compelling reasons for the United States to stop Saudi
Arabia: the instability-stability paradox modeled by India and Pakistan,
the preservation of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, and the loss of
U.S. leverage over an emboldened, nuclear Saudi Arabia. The possibility
of a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race triggered by Iran has also been
widely discussed, and Saudi Arabia's building a nuclear bomb raises
similar concerns. The United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Türkiye are the
most likely candidates to catch the nuclear contagion, though there are
credible reasons to question whether these states would develop nuclear
weapons; Türkiye already enjoys a credible nuclear deterrent as a NATO
member; Egypt has a dilapidated nuclear infrastructure; the United Arab
Emirates has signed a stringent 123 Agreement. This gold standard of
nonproliferation agreements indicates that the UAE is willing to put the
nuclear option aside, at least for now. 

More likely is the possibility of an instability-stability
paradox between a nuclear-armed Iran and Saudi Arabia. The
instability-stability paradox argues that nuclear weapons may produce
stability at the strategic level, but can [simultaneously [fuel]{.mark}
**[distrust]{.mark} and [escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the
conventional level. Iran has sparred with Israel despite its nuclear
arsenal, it could do so with Saudi Arabia as well. The small, vulnerable
nuclear arsenals Iran and Saudi Arabia would possess initially could
also invite counterforce strategies, in which opposing nuclear states
seek to destroy their adversaries' nuclear weapons in a first
strike. India has adopted a counterforce strategy against Pakistan's 150
or so nuclear missiles, and both nations have continued
to skirmish despite their nuclear arsenals. [A [Saudi]{.mark} Arabian
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} program may [not]{.mark} produce
[stability]{.mark} between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Instead, it could
[deepen]{.mark} **[hostilities]{.mark}** between the two
powers. ]{.underline}

There is also the question of the nonproliferation regime.
[S[audi]{.underline}]{.mark} [Arabia's **[bomb-seeking]{.mark}**
behavior may **[shake]{.mark} [up]{.mark} the [global]{.mark}
[s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}** as [tensions]{.mark}
[rise]{.mark}.]{.underline} If East Asian affairs worsen and Saudi
Arabia---a major U.S. ally---were to violate the nonproliferation norm
and gain nuclear weapons it may [**[embolden]{.mark} nuclear**
[hedgers]{.mark} like **Japan** and South **Korea** to [behave]{.mark}
[similarly]{.mark}.]{.underline} Iran's violation of the
nonproliferation norm would be one thing, but the defection of
U.S.-aligned Saudi Arabia could damage the nonproliferation regime
severely. This alone is a compelling reason for the United States to
abstain from sheltering Saudi Arabia's pursuit of weapons. 

The United States also has a well-established strategic logic for
preventing new nuclear-armed states. Nuclear-armed allies restrict the
United States' freedom of action, are difficult to control, and nuclear
weapons may embolden them to act aggressively. Proponents of a United
States retrenchment from the Middle East may be less concerned about
these consequences, but an untethered Saudi Arabia would ensure that the
Middle East continues to distract from more pressing theaters. 

Conclusion: How the United States Can Prevent a Nuclear Saudi Arabia 

The **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has a [series of flawed
options]{.mark} should [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia seriously [pursue]{.mark}
the [bomb]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Firstly, the United States could adopt
an assurance strategy and offer Saudi Arabia a formal defense
relationship that replaces the utility of a Saudi Arabian nuclear
arsenal with the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Secondly, the United States
could threaten Saudi Arabia with abandonment---this is a common U.S.
strategy against allies that are poised to proliferate. It could promise
to leave Saudi Arabia's nuclear weapons program vulnerable to Iranian
attack and vow to ban Saudi Arabia from purchasing U.S. arms. The latter
would be a particularly potent threat: Saudi Arabia's military would
be effectively crippled by the cessation of U.S. military assistance.
Finally, the United States could target Saudi Arabia's efforts to
solicit the PRC's support. The United States has limited options if the
PRC commits to aiding Saudi Arabia with nuclear facilities and
technology. It could 'name and shame' the PRC and hope that the PRC
values its image as a responsible member of the nonproliferation regime
more than Saudi Arabian oil and undermining U.S. policy in the Middle
East. The United States could also hint that it might
encourage Taiwan to follow in Saudi Arabia's footsteps. **[That [would
be]{.mark} extremely [escalatory]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the United
States has no clear trump cards against a Saudi Arabia-PRC nuclear
nexus. **[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} has been [clear]{.mark} and consistent:
it will [dev]{.mark}elop [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} to deter
Iran's security threat]{.underline}** as a potential nuclear state. The
Kingdom hopes that the United States will shelter its pursuit of nuclear
weapons if Iran becomes a nuclear weapons state. Otherwise, it will
likely **[[hide]{.mark} its nuclear [weapons program]{.mark} to limit
the chance of military or economic counteraction]{.underline}**.
However, there is some good news for the United States if it chooses to
prevent Saudi Arabia's active pursuit. Saudi Arabia will need time and a
foreign patron for its nuclear weapons program. As a result, the United
States will have a greater chance of detecting a Saudi nuclear weapons
program, and the chance to cripple it by preventing China or other
powers from coming to its aid. Saudi Arabia's dependency on American
arms and desire for U.S. security guarantees would add potency to U.S.
opposition. There is always a chance that Saudi Arabia's interest in a
civilian nuclear energy program and threat to build nuclear weapons is
an insurance policy to keep the United States engaged and underwriting
the kingdom's security. However, the United States should be alarmed
that a major **[Middle Eastern ally could [pursue nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [and]{.mark} act now to convey to Saudi Arabia that an
effort to build nuclear weapons]{.underline}** would jeopardize Saudi
Arabia's access to U.S. arms and the United States' commitment to the
kingdom's security. Whatever the means employed, a nuclear-armed Saudi
Arabia should not be allowed to come to pass.

weapon[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[about]{.mark} its negotiations on a [nuclear]{.mark}
[cooperation]{.mark} agreement with the United States]{.underline}**,
but the country has announced ambitious plans to expand its nascent
nuclear program by **[purchasing two large nuclear [reactors and
enriching]{.mark} domestically mined uranium.]{.underline}**

As a non-nuclear-weapon state-party to the nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT), Saudi Arabia can legally enrich uranium for peaceful
purposes, but **[its interest in [uranium]{.mark} enrichment is
[complicated by]{.mark} its]{.underline}** **[[threat]{.mark} to
[build]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} to match Iranian
capabilities.]{.underline}**

In a September interview with Fox News, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman said that if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, "we have to get
one." Saudi officials have made similar comments in the past.
(See *ACT*, April 2018.)

The Biden administration's willingness to consider a Saudi enrichment
program is a departure from long-standing U.S. policy to limit the
spread of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing by pressing
states to forgo developing these technologies in nuclear cooperation
agreements with the United States, known as 123 agreements.

A nuclear cooperation agreement is necessary under the 1954 Atomic
Energy Act before certain U.S. technologies and materials can be sold
abroad. As part of the agreement, **[[states must]{.mark} [meet]{.mark}
certain [criteria]{.mark} designed [to]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}
[prolif]{.mark}eration.]{.underline}**

The nuclear negotiations predate a larger effort to normalize
Israeli-Saudi relations. Saudi Arabia may be motivated to include the
nuclear cooperation agreement in the broader rapprochement to gain
Israel's support for its nuclear ambitions.

Israel does not publicly admit to possessing nuclear weapons, but likely
has an arsenal of about 80 warheads. The country is outspoken in
opposition to **[other [states]{.mark} in the region [developing]{.mark}
the capabilities to build [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu campaigned against the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, citing the
agreement's provisions allowing Iran to enrich uranium as a key concern.

*The Wall Street Journal* reported in September that Netanyahu directed
Israeli officials to work with the United States on an agreement that
includes Saudi enrichment, but such a deal still would face criticism in
Israel. Yair Lapid, a member of the Israeli Knesset and leader of the
opposition to Netanyahu's government, said in August that Saudi Arabia
must not have "any level of enrichment."

Although the effort to normalize Saudi-Israeli relations is on hold
after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel retaliated
by striking and blockading the Gaza Strip, **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia is
[unlikely]{.mark} to [abandon]{.mark} [its]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
plan[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[But [even if]{.mark} an [agreement]{.mark} is [reached]{.mark}, it is
[unclear]{.mark} [if]{.mark} [it]{.mark} will [garner]{.mark}
[s]{.mark}ufficient [support]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [U.S]{.mark}.
Congress]{.underline}**. If the agreement meets nine nonproliferation
criteria set out in the Atomic Energy Act, it will enter into effect
unless both houses of Congress pass a resolution of disapproval within
90 days.

If the agreement does not meet the nonproliferation criteria, Congress
must pass a resolution of approval for it to enter into effect.

The nine nonproliferation criteria include a guarantee that any nuclear
materials and equipment are not used for weapons development or other
military purposes and that the recipient state has a comprehensive
safeguards agreement in place with the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).

Given **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia['s]{.mark} public [threats]{.mark} to
[dev]{.mark}elop [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} it may be challenging for the
Biden administration to gain support for any agreement that allows
uranium enrichment, particularly if the kingdom does not have an
additional protocol to its comprehensive safeguards agreement in place.
Additional protocols to safeguards agreements were developed in the
1990s when it became clear from the cases of Iraq and North Korea that a
comprehensive safeguard agreement alone was insufficient to prevent
proliferation. An additional protocol gives the IAEA more access and
information about a country's nuclear activities.

Sixteen Democrats in the U.S. Senate sent a letter to Biden saying that
the United States should "seriously consider" whether it is in its best
interest to support a Saudi nuclear program. The Oct. 4 letter said that
if the United States moves forward on a nuclear cooperation agreement,
it should meet the "gold standard."

The gold standard refers to a nuclear cooperation agreement that
requires the receiving country to forgo enrichment and reprocessing and
adhere to the additional protocol. The U.S. agreement with the United
Arab Emirates meets the gold standard.

Congressional opposition to Saudi enrichment predates the current
nuclear negotiations. During the Trump administration, Sen. Marco Rubio
(R-Fla.) said that the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates ["should
suspend all talks"]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a [nucl]{.mark}ear
[coop]{.mark}eration agreement "until the Saudi government agrees to the
'gold standard' requirements." H]{.underline}**is statement followed the
brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi
government in October 2018.

Rubio and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced legislation that would
require any nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia to meet the gold
standard and secure an affirmative vote of approval from Congress.
(See *ACT*, December 2018.)

The legislation did not become law, but it demonstrates the bipartisan
opposition that Biden likely will face if he attempts to move forward on
an agreement that does not meet the gold standard.

Saudi statements suggest that the country will not accept an agreement
that bans uranium enrichment, but it is unclear if it would accept the
more intrusive additional protocol to its safeguards agreement.

Saudi Arabia only announced in September during the annual IAEA General
Conference that it would negotiate a comprehensive safeguards agreement
with the agency. For years, the IAEA had been urging Saudi Arabia to
update its safeguards.

Until Saudi Arabia adopts its safeguards agreement, IAEA monitoring is
based on an outdated safeguards model, called the small quantities
protocol, designed for states with little or no nuclear materials. That
protocol was designed in the 1970s, but after **[[determining]{.mark} it
was [insufficient]{.mark},]{.underline}** the IAEA revised it in 2005 to
give the agency more tools for conducting safeguards. **[[Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [never adopted]{.mark} the [revised text]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Although Saudi Arabia's announcement that it will adopt a comprehensive
safeguards agreement is a necessary step toward introducing nuclear
materials, the **[[country's]{.mark} [unwillingness]{.mark} to
[update]{.mark} its [safeguards]{.mark} promptly in response to agency
[requests]{.mark} raises [concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In September 2020, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said
Saudi Arabia's small quantities protocol is simply "not adequate."

Saudi Arabia also forged ahead with constructing a research reactor
under the outdated safeguards arrangement, a move that makes it more
difficult for the IAEA to verify the reactor design and develop a
safeguards approach. Standard practice is to allow the agency to inspect
a reactor as it is being built.

The Biden administration has other options to reduce the risk of Riyadh
using a civil nuclear program for weapons purposes besides insisting on
the gold standard or forging an agreement allowing Saudi Arabia to
enrich uranium.

**[It could attempt to [bypass]{.mark} the [question]{.mark} of [Saudi
enrichment]{.mark} by pursuing a black box approach]{.underline}**, by
which the United States would construct and operate a uranium-enrichment
facility on Saudi soil. But it remains unclear how the United States
would respond to any Saudi attempts to nationalize the facility or
prevent the kingdom from acquiring knowledge about enrichment even if
the facility was operated by U.S. personnel.

Furthermore, it may be challenging for the United States to implement
such a proposal. The only U.S.-based and -operated enrichment facility,
Centrus, just began operations in October. The only other commercial
enrichment facility in the United States is operated by Urenco, a
European-based enrichment consortium.

Another option would be to delay determining whether Saudi Arabia will
be allowed to enrich uranium. The United States pursued a similar
approach in its nuclear cooperation agreement with South Korea, when
Seoul sought permission to reprocess spent nuclear fuel.

Delaying the decision would allow the United States and Saudi Arabia to
study the feasibility and proliferation implications and consider
alternative arrangements, such as U.S. support for a fuel fabrication
facility in Saudi Arabia. **[This would [allow]{.mark} [Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia to [produce]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear fuel]{.underline}** with
less proliferation risk because it would not include uranium-enrichment
technology on Saudi soil.

A delay would also give Saudi Arabia time to determine if mining its
uranium deposits is a viable option.

In January 2023, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said
that the country intends to "utilize its national uranium resources" and
pursue "the entire nuclear fuel cycle," including "the production of
yellowcake, low-enriched uranium and the manufacturing of nuclear fuel
both for our national use and of course for export." (See *ACT*, March
2023.)

But a joint publication by the IAEA and the Nuclear Energy Agency, a
multilateral entity run out of the Organization for Co-operation and
Economic Development in Paris, in 2023 assessed that mining Saudi
Arabia's uranium deposits would be "severely uneconomic."

Given **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia['s]{.mark} [threats]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
develop [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it may be
challenging for the country to purchase uranium ore for enrichment.

Australian National University. "Nuclear Turbulence in the Age of

There are multiple alarm bells of growing risks of war and economic
crisis, with institutional arrangements no longer fit for the purpose to
mute conflict and promote co-operation. **[[Geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[have [surged in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[producing a risk of confrontation
[between]{.mark}]{.underline}** the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
\[**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and [the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}**. **[American generals dropped the most
powerful non-nuclear bomb in their arsenal on Afghanistan, seemingly
because they could. They shot down an Iranian drone and a government jet
in Syria]{.underline}**. Describing this as an act of aggression, Russia
cancelled the de-confliction arrangements and warned that it would
target any coalition planes flying west of the Euphrates River. Mikhail
Gorbachev, the former Soviet Russian leader jointly responsible for the
peaceful end of the Cold War, thinks, "**[the world is preparing for
war]{.underline}**." 6 World order---especially its post-1945 normative,
security, trade, and immigration architectures---is at an inflection
point. The United States president with the least previous foreign
policy interest and experience could well have the biggest impact on
global affairs in a century. There is considerable scepticism about
Trump's commitment to uphold the post-1945 liberal international order
crafted under and underwritten by American leadership. Trump,
"determined not to be beaten in \[the global\] competition of political
incompetence," 7 has picked quarrels with allies, friends, and foes
without discrimination. His Administration seems determined to keep even
career diplomats at a distance, dismissing many with a curtness that
slights their decades of professional service in favour of a "know
nothing approach" to foreign policy.8 Trump's transactional approach has
alienated America's neighbours, allies, and friends with little concern
for the importance of diffuse reciprocity as the diplomatic glue that
holds international relationships together.9 Germany's Chancellor Angela
Merkel declared on 28 May 2017, "The times in which we could rely fully
on others---they are somewhat over." Europe should pay more attention to
its own interests "and really take our fate into our own hands." 10
Within months of taking office, Trump saw his own popularity and the
global United States reputation decline steeply. In a 37-country survey
of 40,448 people, only 22 percent had confidence that Trump would do the
right thing in international affairs, down from 64 percent during the
final years in office of President Barack Obama \[2009--2017\].11 The
fall in confidence was especially pronounced amongst close allies in
Asia---including a 55 point fall amongst Australians---and Europe and
immediate neighbours Canada (−61) and Mexico (−44). Global publics
dislike, distrust, and disrespect Trump. They judged both his policies
and character harshly: he "is arrogant \[75%\], intolerant \[65%\] and
even dangerous \[62%\]." Only 26 percent believe he is qualified to be
the American president. Favourable views of the United States fell from
64 to 49 percent. In December 2016, the United States Defence Science
Board urged president-elect Trump to consider acquiring a greater number
of lower-yield weapons that could provide a "tailored nuclear option for
limited use." 12 In a tweet on 22 December, Trump promised to "greatly
strengthen and expand \[U.S.\] nuclear capability." 13 In February 2017,
now president, Trump insisted that the United States would stay at the
"top of the \[nuclear\] pack." 14 The same day the president of Russia,
Vladimir Putin, also spoke of the need to do the same with Russia's
deterrent.15 A day later Trump said, "Let it be an arms race ... we will
outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all." 16 On 2 August,
General Paul Selva, vice-chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said the future of nuclear deterrence lies in smaller, low-yield
nuclear weapons that can be used to attack an adversary without ending
the world or causing massive indiscriminate casualties.17 In August,
Trump exchanged an escalating series of bellicose threats with Kim
Jong-un using words like "fire and fury" and military "solutions" that
are "fully in place, locked and loaded." He left many world leaders
uneasy and earned an exhortation from Beijing to avoid words and deeds
that can exacerbate the situation.18 The strategically challenged Trump
seemed to suggest that Japan and South Korea could obtain their own
nuclear arsenals.19 His unpredictability, unreliability, and scepticism
about the value of NATO awakened interest in an independent European
nuclear deterrent. Roderich Kiesewetter, a parliamentarian and spokesman
for Germany's ruling party, raised the possibility shortly after Trump's
election in 2016, and Poland's former prime minister, Jaroslaw
Kaczynski, repeated it in February 2017.20 A review commissioned by
Bundestag concluded that Germany could legally finance British or French
nuclear weapon programmes in return for their protection.21 **[All [such
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}** are greatly worrying. They also
**[[imply]{.mark} a [rejection of the NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[as]{.mark} the [globally legitimate]{.mark} framework]{.underline}**
**[for regulating nuclear policy]{.underline}**. Against this volatile
backdrop, the fact that Trump has his fingers on the buttons of the
world's most lethal nuclear arsenal **[[stokes the sum of all nuclear
fears worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**.22 At the time of his impeachment
hearings in 1973, President Richard Nixon told a group of Congressmen:
"I could leave this room and in 25 minutes, 70 million people would be
dead." 23 Towards the end of the George W. Bush Administration, Vice
President Dick Cheney similarly remarked in a television interview that
**[the American president [has]{.mark} the [authority to launch
a]{.mark} "devastating" [nuclear attack without having "to check with
anybody]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He doesn't have to call the Congress. He
doesn't have to check with the courts. **[He has that authority because
of the nature of the world we live in]{.underline}**." 24 **[That is the
authority and power now vested in Trump]{.underline}**: he "cannot
remove a local school board member, but **[if the impulse should strike
him ... \[nuclear\] weapons would be in the air within
minutes."]{.underline}** 25 **[[The NPT]{.mark} has [kept the nuclear
nightmare at bay]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[for]{.underline}** **[five
decades]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[whilst underpinning and facilitating
the global trade in nuclear material for peaceful
purposes]{.underline}**. At the heart of the NPT lay three bargains
involving nuclear energy, non-proliferation, and disarmament. It
permitted five countries---Britain, China, France, Russia, and the
United States---to keep nuclear weapons but work to eliminate them
through negotiations and prohibited their acquisition by anyone else.
**[Its significant and enduring successes notwithstanding, over the
years the NPT has built up many anomalies, shortcomings, flaws, and gaps
between promise and performance]{.underline}**.26 A global retreat from
nuclear power has occurred since Japan's 2011 Fukushima accident; four
Nuclear Security Summits held between 2010 and 2016 assumed the lead on
nuclear security; nonproliferation obligations have been successfully
universalised to all countries that do not possess nuclear weapons; and
no nuclear arms control negotiations are currently taking place between
any NWS. The NPT's normative potential appeared exhausted on all
relevant dimensions. Most **[importantly]{.underline}**,
**[[with]{.mark} the [refusal]{.mark} of the NWS [to]{.mark} accept and
[implement]{.mark}]{.underline}** the 1996 International Court of
Justice Advisory Opinion that **[[Article VI]{.underline}]{.mark}**
obliges them to engage in and bring to a conclusion good faith
negotiations to eliminate nuclear arsenals,27 **[[the NPT]{.mark} was
[transformed from a prohibition]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[into a
non-prolif]{.mark}eration [regime]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Because the
commitment to disarm was neither timetabled, precise, nor
binding]{.underline}**,28 **[the NPT has [failed to]{.mark} function as

[possession]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and deployment of nuclear weapons
and reducing nuclear warheads as steps to their complete
elimination]{.underline}**. **[Global numbers]{.underline}** of nuclear
warheads **[have fallen]{.underline}** dramatically since the 1980s,
**[but this has occurred chiefly because of bilateral

**[to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. Yet in 50 years since

reductions and non-proliferation remain stuck. On the other,
**[[non-prolif]{.mark}eration [norms are

South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. The world could survive on the edge of
disaster with one erratic and volatile leader, like North Korea's Kim
Jong-un, with his finger on the nuclear button; but the presence of two
such leaders in Pyongyang and Washington dramatically increases the risk
of nuclear disaster]{.underline}**. Specialists' concerns that
**[nuclear peace is dangerously dependent on rational decision-makers in
office in all nuclear-armed states have become a global public
nightmare]{.underline}**.31 The pathways to a war that neither side
wants include a fatal miscalculation in the instrumental recourse to
brinksmanship by both sides. The anxiety level increases with growing
revelations of the number of times that the world has come frighteningly
close to nuclear holocaust.32 In the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, American
strategy found basis on the best available intelligence, which indicated
that there were no nuclear warheads in Cuba. In fact, there were 162
warheads already stationed there, and the local Soviet commander had
taken them out of storage to deployed positions for use against an
American invasion.33 The approved protocol required the decision by a
submarine's three ranking officers to launch nuclear-tipped torpedoes to
be unanimous. On 27 October 1962, Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov cast the
nuclear war-avoiding dissenting vote in a 2--1 decision in favour of a
nuclear launch; 55 years later, he received the inaugural Future of Life
prize for his action.34 In addition, on 28 October 1962, a missile
launch base in Okinawa received a coded order to launch missiles and
carried out the required three-level confirmation process. However, not
all missiles targeted Russia, which made the crew suspicious, and
further clarifications confirmed that the order was a mistake.35 In
November 1983, in response to a NATO war games exercise Able Archer,
which Moscow mistook to be real, the Soviets came close to launching a
full-scale nuclear attack against the West.36 On 25 January 1995, Norway
launched a scientific research rocket in its northern latitude. Because
of the speed and trajectory of the powerful rocket, whose stage three
mimicked a Trident sea launched ballistic missile, the Russian early
warning radar system near Murmansk tagged it within seconds of launch as
a possible American nuclear missile attack. Fortunately, the rocket did
not mistakenly stray into Russian airspace.37 On 29 August 2007, an
American B-52 bomber carrying six air-launched cruise missiles armed
with nuclear warheads made an unauthorised 2,200-kilometre flight from
North Dakota to Louisiana and was effectively absent without leave for
36 hours.38 Following the Ukraine crisis, in the one-year period March
2014 to March 2015, one study documented several serious and high-risk
incidents.39 A 2016 Global Zero study similarly documented dangerous
encounters in the South China Sea and South Asia.40 As for near misses
in an accident, in January 1961, a four megaton bomb---that is, 260
times more powerful than that used at Hiroshima---was just one ordinary
switch away from detonating over North Carolina when a B-52 bomber on a
routine flight went into an uncontrolled spin.41 This selective
catalogue of **[misperceptions]{.underline}**,
**[miscalculations]{.underline}**, **[near misses]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[accidents]{.underline}**
**[underscore]{.underline}**s the message of successive international
commissions that as long as any state has nuclear weapons, others will
want them. As long as they exist, they will be used again someday, if
not by design and intent, then through miscalculation, accident, rogue
launch, or system malfunction. **[[Any]{.mark} such [use anywhere could
spell catastrophe for the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The only
guarantee of zero nuclear weapons risk is to move to zero nuclear
weapons possession by a carefully managed process.
**[[Proponents]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [are]{.mark} the real
["nuclear romantics" who]{.mark} exaggerate the bombs' significance,
[downplay]{.mark} their substantial [risks, and imbue]{.mark} them with
["quasi-magical powers"]{.mark} also known as nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**.42 The claim that nuclear weapons could not
proliferate if they did not exist is both an empirical and a logical
truth. The very fact of their existence in the arsenals of nine
countries is sufficient guarantee of their proliferation to others and,
some day again, use. Conversely, nuclear disarmament is a necessary
condition of nuclear nonproliferation.

**[[and discipline over]{.mark} the temptation to launch [preemptive
strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}** during the early stages of a conflict,
when new nuclear weapons capabilities are soft and vulnerable.

[**[Such assumptions are]{.underline}**
**[unrealistic]{.underline}**]{.mark} in many parts of the world. Far
from enhancing security**[, the first effects of acquiring a nuclear
capability]{.underline}** in many circumstances **[may be to increase
one's vulnerability and insecurity.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[[even a
local, "tactical" nuclear strike would be a serious breach of an 80-year
global taboo]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[One]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[must consider the destabilizing
roles that nonstate actors could play]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Even if
the risk of a terrorist group acquiring a nuclear device is low, [the
mere possibility creates severe challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[The fact that weapons-usable materials can be stolen or sold to rogue
states]{.underline}** on the black market **[means that [the threat
posed by nonstate groups does not depend solely on their technological
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Nor would today's
superpowers]{.underline}** necessarily **[be immune from the
effects]{.underline}**. The wide or **[rapid spread of nuclear
capabilities could affect the global strategic balance]{.underline}**
and the prospects of a peaceful and just world order in the future.

Obviously, political and technical trends will continue to change. But
the key question concerns the future of US alliances and extended
deterrence. **[[Given that proliferation could be
destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that nuclear weapons do not always
enhance the acquiring state's geopolitical position, and that
superpowers cannot fully escape the effects, **[[there should be a
strong global interest in maintaining the nonproliferation
regime.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Under the current circumstances, [**[some inequality in weaponry is
acceptable to most states because the alternative]{.underline}** --
**[anarchic equality]{.underline}** -- **[is more
dangerous]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As long as countries can be made
better off without a bomb than with one, a policy of slowing the spread
of nuclear-weapons technology will rest on a strong foundation.
Realistically, an international regime does not need perfect adherence
to have a significant constraining effect. But once erosion of the norms
and institutions begins, it may be hard to stop.

**[Nuclear weapon use in a limited manner may be a serious
threat]{.underline}**, and **[the proliferation of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** and the changing state of the world into a
multipolar nuclear order **[may encourage this]{.underline}**.
**[Despite tensions between the U.S. and USSR, they were ultimately able
to manage this competition in a bipolar nuclear world]{.underline}**;
this competition for advantage and security ended with the eventual
collapse of the USSR. The security dilemma ran its course without the
use of nuclear weapons, and the U.S. rose to become the hegemon of a
unipolar world. However, **[[in a multipolar]{.mark} nuclear
[world]{.mark}, the [challenges faced]{.mark} previously [are
significantly exacerbated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Currently, the nine
known nuclear-weapon states are the United States, the United Kingdom,
Russia, China, France, Israel, Pakistan, India, and North Korea.\[14\]
**[[Strategies that worked in]{.mark} a [bipolar world]{.mark} may [not
be]{.mark} as [effective]{.mark} in the modern landscape, [thus
preventing]{.mark} the [failure of deterrence]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} the
subsequent [use of a nuclear weapon]{.mark}---[may be more
challenging]{.mark} than before. The most recent nuclear state, North
Korea, is one of the most troubling in the current group of nuclear
states]{.underline}**. North Korea is one of the world's poorest states,
facing harsh sanctions and isolation from much of the international
community. Yet, despite the hardships, poverty, and poor economy of this
autocratic state, it managed to defy the nonproliferation regime and
create a fully operational nuclear arsenal.\[15\] **[Pyongyang is not
bashful about its willingness to use its weaponry either, stating that
it will use its weapons to "reduce the U.S.]{.underline}** mainland
**[to ashes and darkness]{.underline}**."\[16\] **[Such a clear security
threat may increase proliferation elsewhere in response]{.underline}**.
**[Allison calls this [the "nuclear cascade,"]{.mark} and [suggests that
if a state]{.mark} as [weak]{.mark} and isolated [as No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea [can defy the]{.mark} non-proliferation [regime]{.mark},
[other states]{.mark} are [likely to follow
suit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\[17\] **[If the United States is incapable
of preventing such a clear security threat, why would Tokyo and Seoul
rely on Washington to defend them in the face of a nuclear
threat?]{.underline}** Japan already has the capability to build nuclear
weapons, possessing well-developed uranium enrichment and missile
programs that could allow Japan to rapidly create a credible nuclear
weapons program to defend itself and its national interests without the
United States. According to The Council on Foreign Relations, **[there
are [thirty states]{.mark} that [have the tech]{.mark}nological ability
[to quickly build nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\[18\] While
Pyongyang claims offensive intentions, it is incredibly unlikely to
attempt to use its nuclear forces offensively against the United States.
Doing so would be an act of suicide, the disparity between U.S. and
North Korean forces is far too great. Instead, these weapons were more
than likely obtained for defensive purposes. Pyongyang may not be able
to destroy the United States, but it can ensure its own sovereignty.
Forcibly trying to topple the Kim regime could escalate into the use of
nuclear force if Pyongyang got desperate, and a strike designed to
eradicate their nuclear weapons would again invoke this "use it or lose
it" mentality. While Pyongyang may not be able to destroy the U.S. with
its capabilities, it can undeniably cause immense harm to the US. It
could cause even greater harm to smaller, closer countries such as U.S.
allies Japan and South Korea. Knowledge of this is a strong deterrent
against U.S. intervention, allowing Pyongyang to carry on less
cautiously without fearing foreign intervention. The creation of this
deterrent may have effectively ensured the sovereignty of the Kim regime
for the time being, and they are unlikely to relinquish this guarantee.
The establishment of this deterrent highlights some of the challenges in
the modern nuclear era. **[North Korea's]{.underline}** outright
**[defiance of the nonproliferation regime sends a signal that other
states can build a nuclear capability as well]{.underline}** and that
such a force may be an effective way to guarantee their sovereignty
against the Western world.\[19\] **[[Prolif]{.mark}eration [to
autocratic states is]{.mark} [a]{.mark} cause for [concern]{.mark},
primarily because they]{.underline}** are considerably less stable than
democratic states and **[may be [more willing to utilize a nuclear
weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The [inherently volatile nature
of]{.mark} these [regimes poses]{.mark} a significant
[challenge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** North Korea has a very poor and
impoverished populace, held under authoritarian rule. **[Regimes such as
these are not known for their longevity and stability. The threat of
regime change and revolt from within is a realistic
consideration]{.underline}** with autocratic states. **[If this
occurred, it could result in the loss of a nuclear weapon, or their
domestic use to quell a rebellion]{.underline}**.\[20\] **[It
could]{.underline}** also **[escalate into conflict as Chinese and U.S.
forces both seek to secure their nuclear assets and end up in conflict
with each other]{.underline}**. China would certainly not accept U.S.
forces along the Yalu river, and both would want to immediately seek to
ensure the stability of Pyongyang's nuclear assets. Autocratic states
could also safely assume that Western powers would prefer it if they
were a democratic government friendly to the West. With the
international liberal orders push for global democracy, autocratic
rulers are likely to fear Western interference. After Pyongyang's recent
success, a nuclear weapons capability may appear to be an effective way
to prevent Western interference and ensure its sovereignty. **[With
smaller autocratic states, the [constant external and internal threats
to]{.mark} the [stability of]{.mark} their [regimes breed paranoia and
volatility]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Leading government officials tend
to be promoted based on loyalty rather than competence,]{.underline}**
and disagreement or discontent with the dictator may be punished
harshly, stifling progress and ingenuity. **[These [regimes also]{.mark}
tend to [have strong military leadership]{.mark} directing the
country.]{.underline}** Pakistan is notable in this regard, where the
military maintains significant control over the government and has a
history of instigating a military coup when they dislike civilian
leadership. Pakistan has had four separate military coups since its
creation, with military dictators constantly consolidating their power
into the executive branch.\[21\] **[Military leadership is [far more
likely to see nuclear weapons]{.mark} use [as]{.mark} a [viable
option]{.mark}, which increases the instability of nuclear autocratic
regimes even further]{.underline}**. Civilian leadership has arguably
been a key factor in preventing nuclear use thus far. Military officers
often possess a different mindset and attitude on the subject than
civilian leadership due to their career path. **[During the Cold War,
there were numerous instances where the Joint Chiefs of Staff were far
more willing to utilize nuclear weapons in a preventive war and were
reined in by U.S. civilian leadership]{.underline}**.\[22\]
**[[Throughout the Cold War]{.mark}, [there were numerous false
alarms]{.mark}; equipment detected [missile launches that did not
exist]{.mark}, [drills]{.mark} were [confused for]{.mark} real
[launches]{.mark}, and [communication cut-offs and]{.mark} the "[fog of
war]{.mark}" [nearly led to nuclear use]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\[23\]
**[If faced with similar threats, it is less likely that an autocratic
state will respond in such a level-headed manner.]{.underline}** With
shorter-range nuclear weapons, this could be exacerbated. **[These
[states]{.mark} are [less likely to have a]{.mark} robust, [survivable
nuclear arsenal]{.mark}. If a state's nuclear arsenal is threatened, it
is likely to take action to ensure its survival or use.]{.underline}**
Without having the same geographic separation that the U.S. and USSR
did, several states today rely on shorter-range weapons, like
short-range missiles and multi-role fighter/bomber aircraft. Whether
these weapons systems carry nuclear or conventional payloads may be
unknown; being forced to make a rapid decision to respond to a potential
threat may push a state over the edge to ensure its security.\[24\]
**[Particularly [concerning]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least in regard
to stability, **[[is the smaller size and]{.mark} the [heightened
vulnerability of many arsenals]{.mark} compared to other
states]{.underline}**. **[The [multipolar nuclear order lacks]{.mark}
the same levels of [parity]{.mark} both quantitatively and qualitatively
that were present in the Cold War]{.underline}**. **[The number of
weapons between states varies significantly.]{.underline}** While exact
numbers are typically classified, **[experts have estimated a range
varying from approximately 20 warheads in North Korea, to around 6,000
for both the U.S. and Russia]{.underline}**.\[25\] **[Destroying all the
nuclear weapons in North Korea is significantly easier to do than
performing the same action against the U.S. or Russia, and this may be
[especially true with]{.mark} an]{.underline}** **[even
[newer]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}autocratic **[[state]{.mark} that
develops a brand-new nuclear capability]{.underline}**. **[The [parity
dilemma]{.mark} further [extends to conventional
capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[A [state with
inferior]{.mark} conventional [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}such as North Korea compared to the U.S. or Pakistan compared
to India, **[may [feel pressured]{.mark} into utilizing, or at least
threatening, [to use]{.mark} its [nuclear capabilities]{.mark} to make
up for its inferiority]{.underline}**. **[If a nuclear-armed state lacks

THE NUCLEAR UNDERGROUND

**[[Iran has]{.mark} long [weathered attacks that failed to fatally
damage its nuclear program]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[These
include]{.underline}** the **[Stuxnet]{.underline}** cyberattack on the
Natanz facility, a joint U.S.-Israeli effort that damaged roughly 1,000
centrifuges in 2009 and 2010; **[a wave of Israeli assassinations of
Iranian nuclear scientists]{.underline}** between 2010 and 2012; and
more recent **[Israeli acts of sabotage against]{.underline}** the
**[Natanz]{.underline}** facility in 2020 and 2021. **[[Iran has
responded to each attack by making its physical infrastructure more
resilient]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including by building more advanced
centrifuges and moving key facilities such as Fordow deep underground.
**[[Some of Iran's advantages remain beyond the reach of
airstrikes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[including its mastery of the
nuclear-fuel cycle]{.underline}**---something Syria's far less extensive
program lacked.

Crucially, [**[the attempts to attack its nuclear program
have]{.underline}** **[hardened Iran's resolve]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[and intensified the beliefs of the country's leadership that a
nuclear deterrent is necessary]{.underline}** to prevent its
enemies---primarily Israel and the United States---from threatening Iran
at will. **[Senior regime officials have condemned the latest U.S.
assault as a "barbaric violation" of international law
and]{.underline}** publicly **[discussed withdrawing from
the]{.underline}** Nuclear
**[N]{.underline}**on**[p]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty, a move that would end IAEA oversight of Iran's
nuclear program and remove the last legal barrier to rapid
weaponization. **[[Even if inspections continue, Tehran will likely
become less cooperative]{.mark} with them]{.underline}**.
**[Politically, the strikes reinforce the Iranian hard-line view that
compromise invites vulnerability]{.underline}**---Tehran believes that
allowing IAEA inspectors to remain onsite would make future attacks
easier by exposing sensitive locations to adversaries under the guise of
international monitoring.

JUST FOR SHOW

**[Direct military attacks on nuclear programs are designed to eliminate
a state's ability to build a nuclear weapon by destroying critical
infrastructure]{.underline}**, killing key **[personnel]{.underline}**,
**[or]{.underline}** otherwise limiting the target's
**[capacity]{.underline}** to assemble a device. **[But [physical
capability is only half of what goes into]{.mark} a
[nuclearization]{.mark} push.]{.underline}** **[[Building a nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [**[requires]{.underline}**
**[immense political will]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In the forthcoming
edited volume Atomic Backfires: When Nuclear Policies Fail, Tyler John
Bowen and I detail how **[[conventional military attacks]{.mark} on all
but the most nascent nuclear programs [rarely achieve their long-term
objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**[Our research]{.underline}**,
**[encompassing]{.underline}** **[every case of offensive
counterproliferation]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [**[shows a consistent
pattern]{.underline}**:]{.mark} **[although [bombing]{.mark} a country's
nuclear program may temporarily reduce its physical
capability]{.underline}** to build a device, **[such an
attack]{.underline}** almost invariably [**[strengthens the target
country's belief that building nuclear weapons is essential to its
survival]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Proponents of conventional strikes against nuclear programs point to
Israel's 2007 bombing of Syria's al-Kibar reactor. The attack seemed to
be remarkably effective. Al-Kibar, a covert plutonium-production reactor
modeled on a North Korean design, was destroyed before it became
operational, after which Syria never renewed its efforts to acquire
nuclear weapons. But al-Kibar is the exception that proves the rule. The
success of the operation relied on factors not likely to be repeated.
The reactor was imported wholesale, and Syria lacked the domestic
expertise to replicate it independently, making its nuclear program
critically reliant on foreign assistance. This dependence severely
constrained Syria's ability to reconstitute the program; following the
strike, international scrutiny intensified, and Syrian leaders could not
domestically procure or rebuild essential components. The country was
furthermore buckling under the weight of a devastating drought and on
the verge of a catastrophic civil war. The site was later seized by the
Islamic State (also known as ISIS). Ultimately, the al-Kibar strike was
less a decisive blow than a firm nudge to a program already teetering on
the brink of collapse.

The case of **[[Iraq offers a]{.underline}]{.mark}** more **[[cautionary
tale]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Israel's airstrike on]{.underline}** the
country's **[Osirak]{.underline}** reactor, in 1981,
**[was]{.underline}** originally **[lauded]{.underline}** as a triumph
of preventive action. But a closer examination reveals that the attack
was probably counterproductive. **[Although it destroyed the reactor, it
also convinced]{.underline}** Iraq's leader, Saddam
**[Hussein]{.underline}**, **[that he needed a nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**. Instead of halting Iraq's nuclear weapons
program, **[the attack drove it underground]{.underline}**---further
from international scrutiny---**[and prompted Saddam to invest more
resources into enriching uranium]{.underline}**. By 1990, Iraq was
perilously close to being able to build a nuclear bomb.

**[[What ultimately dismantled Saddam's program
was]{.underline}]{.mark}** not a targeted strike but the bureaucratic
and **[[legal controls imposed after the Gulf
War]{.underline}]{.mark}**---namely, the United Nations' comprehensive
sanctions and its intrusive inspections regime, which oversaw the
destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Subsequent U.S.
cruise missile strikes on sites such as Zaafaraniyah were largely
performative; UN inspectors confirmed that the sites had already been
mothballed. The lesson is clear: inspections and sanctions, not bombs,
were the key to Iraqi disarmament. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' subsequent 2003 **[invasion]{.underline}** of
Iraq, predicated on a phantom weapons-of-mass-destruction program,
**[provided a powerful example to Iran and North Korea on the perils of
lacking a nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**. Pyongyang explicitly cited
Saddam's fate when it accelerated the work that culminated in its first
nuclear weapons test, in 2006.

PARIS/ISTANBUL, June 22 (Reuters) - In a bid to defuse the conflict over
Iran\'s nuclear program, **[foreign ministers from Europe\'s top three
powers hurried to meet their Iranian counterpart on Friday in
Geneva.]{.underline}**

Those **[[hopes collapsed]{.mark} on Saturday [when U.S.]{.mark}
President Donald Trump [ordered airstrikes on Iran\'s three main nuclear
sites]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in support of Israel\'s military campaign.

[\"**[It\'s irrelevant to ask Iran to return to
diplomacy]{.underline}**]{.mark},\" Iran\'s **[foreign minister Abbas
Araqchi]{.underline}**, visibly angry, **[told reporters in Istanbul on
Sunday]{.underline}**, promising a \"response\" to the U.S. strikes.
\"**[[It\'s not time for diplomacy now]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**

Trump, who said the U.S. airstrikes \"obliterated\" the sites, warned in
a televised speech on Saturday the U.S. could attack other targets in
Iran if no peace deal was reached and urged Tehran to return to the
negotiating table.

Reuters spoke to seven Western diplomats and analysts who said the
prospect of negotiations was negligeable for now, with an unbridgeable
gap between Washington\'s demand for zero enrichment by Iran and
Tehran\'s refusal to abandon its nuclear program.

**[\"I think the [prospects of effective diplomacy at this point
are]{.mark} slim to [none]{.mark},\" said]{.underline}** James Acton,
**[co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace]{.underline}**, a think tank headquartered in
Washington.

\"I\'m **[much [more worried about escalation]{.mark}, both in the short
and the long term]{.underline}**.\"

According to European diplomats, the three European allies - Britain,
France and Germany - were not made aware of Trump\'s decision to strike
Iran ahead of time. French President Emmanuel Macron had promised on
Saturday - just before the U.S. strikes - to accelerate the nuclear
talks, following a call with his Iranian counterpart.

**[One European [diplomat]{.mark}]{.underline}**, who asked not to be
identified, **[[acknowledged]{.mark} there was now [no way of holding a
planned second meeting with Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the coming
week.

In the wake of the U.S. military action, **[any European [diplomatic
role]{.mark} appears likely to be [secondary]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Trump on Friday dismissed Europe\'s efforts towards resolving the
crisis, saying Iran only wanted to speak to the United States.

Three diplomats and analysts said any future talks between Iran and
Washington would likely be through regional intermediaries Oman and
Qatar, once Tehran decides how to respond to the U.S. airstrikes on its
nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

**[The attacks leave Iran with few palatable options on the
table]{.underline}**. Since Israel began its military campaign against
Iran on June 13, some in **[Tehran have raised the prospect of
withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT)]{.underline}** to signal Iran\'s determination to accelerate
enrichment, but experts say that would represent a considerable
escalation and likely draw a forceful response from Washington.

Acton, of the Carnegie Endowment, said Iran\'s most obvious means for
retaliation is its short-range ballistic missiles, that could be used to
target U.S. forces and assets in the region. But any military response
by Iran carried the risk of miscalculation, he said.

\"On the one hand, they want a strong enough response that they feel the
U.S. has actually paid a price. On the other hand, they don\'t want to
encourage further escalation,\" he said.

EUROPEAN EFFORT ENDED IN FAILURE

Even before the U.S. strikes, Friday\'s talks in Geneva showed little
sign of progress amid a chasm between the two sides and in the end no
detailed proposals were put forward, three diplomats said. Mixed
messaging may have also undermined their own efforts, diplomats said.

European positions on key issues like Iran\'s enrichment program have
hardened in the past 10 days with the Israeli strikes and the looming
threat of U.S. bombing.

The three European powers, known as the E3, were parties to a 2015
nuclear deal that Trump abandoned three years later during his first
term.

Both the Europeans and Tehran believed they had a better understanding
of how to get a realistic deal given the E3 have been dealing with
Iran\'s nuclear programme since 2003.

But the Europeans have had a difficult relationship with Iran in recent
months as they sought to pressure it over its ballistic missiles
programme, support for Russia and detention of European citizens.

France, which was the keenest to pursue negotiations, has in the last
few days suggested Iran should move towards zero enrichment, which until
now was not an E3 demand given Iran\'s red line on the issue, two
European diplomats said.

Britain has also adopted a tougher stance more in tune with Washington
and that was expressed in Geneva, the diplomats said. And Germany\'s new
government appeared to go in the same direction, although it was more
nuanced.

\"Iran has to accept zero enrichment eventually,\" said one EU official.

A senior Iranian official on Saturday showed disappointment at the
Europeans\' new stance, saying their demands were \"unrealistic\",
without providing further details.

In a brief joint statement on Sunday, which acknowledged the U.S.
strikes, the European countries said they would continue their
diplomatic efforts.

\"We call upon Iran to engage in negotiations leading to an agreement
that addresses all concerns associated with its nuclear program,\" it
said, adding the Europeans stood ready to contribute \"in coordination
with all parties\".

David Khalfa, co-founder of the Atlantic Middle East Forum, a
Paris-based think tank, said Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\'s government
had taken advantage of the Europeans for years to gain time as it
developed its nuclear program and ballistic missile capabilities.

\"The European attempt ended in failure,\" he said.

However, the Europeans still have one important card to play. They are
the only ones who, as party to the nuclear accord, can launch its
so-called \"snapback mechanism\", which would reimpose all previous UN
sanctions on Iran if it is found to be in violation of the agreement\'s
terms.

Diplomats said, prior to the U.S. strikes, the three countries had
discussed an end-August deadline to activate it as part of a \'maximum
pressure\' campaign on Tehran.

\"MULTIPLE CHANNELS\" FOR U.S. TALKS

In total, the U.S. launched 75 precision-guided munitions, including
more than two dozen Tomahawk missiles, and more than 125 military
aircraft in the operation against the three nuclear sites, U.S.
officials said.

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Sunday warned Iran against
retaliation and said both public and private messages had been sent to
Iran \"in multiple channels, giving them every opportunity to come to
the table.\"

Five previous rounds of indirect negotiations between the United States
and Iran collapsed after a U.S. proposal at the end of May called for
Iran to abandon uranium enrichment. It was rejected by Tehran, leading
to Israel launching its attack on Iran after Trump\'s 60-day deadline
for talks had expired.

**[[Iran]{.mark} has repeatedly said from then on that it would [not
negotiate while at war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Even after Israel struck, **[[Washington reached out to]{.mark} Iran to
[resume negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including offering a
meeting between the Trump and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in
Istanbul, according to two European diplomats and an Iranian official.

**[[That was rebuffed]{.mark} by Iran]{.underline}**, but Araqchi did
continue direct contacts with US Special envoy Steve Witkoff, three
diplomats told Reuters.

One of the challenges in engaging with Iran, experts say, is that no-one
can be sure of the extent of the damage to its nuclear program. With the
**[IAEA severely restricted in its access to Iranian
sites]{.underline}**, it is unclear whether Tehran has hidden enrichment
facilities.

A senior Iranian source told Reuters on Sunday most of the highly
enriched uranium at Fordow, the site producing the bulk of Iran\'s
uranium refined to up to 60%, had been moved to an undisclosed location
before the U.S. attack there.

Acton, of the Carnegie Endowment, said that - putting aside from the
damage to its physical installations - Iran had thousands of scientists
and technicians involved in the enrichment program, most of whom had
survived the U.S. and Israeli attacks.

\"You can\'t bomb knowledge,\" said Acton.

However, he noted that they failed to clarify their stance regarding
potential attacks during the discussion period.

Discussions between the US and Iran concerning Iran\'s nuclear programme
were ongoing when Israel conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities

Just days ago, President [[Trump had appeared to embrace hopes for a
diplomatic end to the war]{.underline}]{.mark} between Israel and Iran,
holding off on immediate U.S. strikes and saying he might wait as much
as two weeks to give negotiations a chance to work.

[[Less than 48 hours later]{.underline}]{.mark} , [[American bombers
dropped their]{.underline}]{.mark} largest and [[most
destructive]{.underline}]{.mark} conventional [[payloads
on]{.underline}]{.mark} two of [[Iran's nuclear
facilities]{.underline}]{.mark} and fired missiles at a third,
[[casting]{.underline}]{.mark} fresh [[doubt on the possibility that
diplomats might get both sides to lay down their
arms.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Mr. [[Trump had suggested for months that he wanted to avoid military
action]{.underline}]{.mark} against Iran --- but was prepared to take it
if necessary. In mid-April, the president authorized 60 days of direct
negotiations, which all but collapsed when Israel attacked Iran on June
13. Even then, Mr . Trump stopped short of threatening a strike, calling
for Iran to surrender diplomatically.

The [[result was an extended Washington case of "will he or won't he,"
fueled]{.underline}]{.mark} in part [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr.
[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} own running [[commentary about his
intentions]{.underline}]{.mark} toward Iran. Asked last week about
ordering strikes, [[he told reporters]{.underline}]{.mark} that "I may
do it. I may not do it, adding [[proudly, "Nobody knows what I'm going
to do."]{.underline}]{.mark}

The revelation of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
[[strikes]{.underline}]{.mark} on Sunday, code-named Midnight Hammer ,
[[left Iranians]{.underline}]{.mark} and much of the world [[struggling
with basic questions]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[Was the
president's]{.underline}]{.mark} public
[[hesitation]{.underline}]{.mark} to embrace military force [[actually a
feint designed to lull Iran into complacency]{.underline}]{.mark} while
the Pentagon prepared its assault? [[And]{.underline}]{.mark} if so,
[[what does that mean for the prospect of future]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[attempts to]{.underline}]{.mark} find a
[[negotiate]{.underline}]{.mark}d end to the fighting?

"[[There are concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Middle East [[that the
U.S. is]{.underline}]{.mark} now complicit in

The [[Trump administration]{.mark} began [firing more than **1,000 State
Department employees**]{.mark} on Friday]{.underline}, as it moves to
downsize the federal government's diplomatic arm in what critics say is
a risky retreat from America's global engagement.

The layoffs are [[part of a reorganization plan]{.mark} devised by
Secretary of State Marco Rubio]{.underline}, who says his department is
too costly, cumbersome and ideological. Continuing President Trump's
drive to slash a federal work force he inherently distrusts, the [job
[cuts will drain]{.mark} the [department]{.mark} of expertise [and
batter]{.mark} the [morale]{.mark} of those who remain]{.underline},
critics say.

But the plan also has [global implications]{.underline}, veteran
diplomats say. It [[refocuses American diplomacy around]{.mark} Mr.
[Trump's]{.mark} narrow and [transactional sense of]{.mark} the
[national interest]{.mark}]{.underline} while [[downgrading
priorities]{.mark} such as human rights, democracy and
refugees]{.underline}. In doing so, critics argue, it undermines a moral
purpose that, however imperfectly and inconsistently applied, has been a
source of pride for generations of Americans and has distinguished the
United States from more coldblooded global competitors such as Russia
and China.

Democrats and diplomats also warned on Friday that Mr. Rubio's plan to
[[cut the department]{.mark}'s U.S.-based work force [by]{.mark} about
[17 percent]{.mark},]{.underline} including through about 1,400 layoffs
announced on Friday, [would **[leave the department short
handed]{.mark}** --- [especially after]{.mark} the recent [elimination
of]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} [A]{.mark}gency for [I]{.mark}nternational
[D]{.mark}evelopment]{.underline}, whose relatively few surviving
programs will be transferred to the State Department.

["[As]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [U.S. retreats]{.mark}]{.underline}, our
[[adversaries]{.mark} --- [like]{.mark} the People's Republic of
[China]{.mark} --- are [expanding their diplomatic

prosperous," said a statement signed by the Democratic members of the

"If this administration is serious about putting 'America first,' it
[[must invest in]{.mark} our [diplomatic corps and national security

The US [[state department]{.mark} has begun [issuing]{.mark} the
**[first of more than 1,350 termination notices]{.mark}** as part of a
huge reorganisation of America's diplomatic corps]{.underline} under the
secretary of state, Marco Rubio, according to internal documents and US
diplomats at the state department on Friday.

Career diplomats and other staff began to receive the notices on Friday
morning, days after the supreme court lifted a ban on the Trump
administration moving forward with mass firings of government employees
that will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

"Hearing 'I got mine!' around the floor," one current state department
employee told the Guardian.

In an internal email obtained by the Guardian on Friday, state
department workers were told that nearly 3,000 employees would leave as
part of a vast reorganisation meant to align the department's goals with
Donald Trump's stated goal of putting America first.

["This \[Reduction in Force\] [comprises 1,107 civil service and 246
Foreign Service employees with domestic
assignments]{.mark},]{.underline}" read the email. [Another [1,600
employees]{.mark} are believed to have [left]{.mark} the service [via a
voluntary redundancy scheme]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent months.

The state department had confirmed on Thursday that it planned to move
forward with the layoffs.

[The [cull]{.mark} of approximately 15% of the state department
workforce [is unprecedented for the diplomatic
corps]{.mark},]{.underline} and confusion over the process as well as
the temporary court injunction against mass firings of government
employees have made the rollout even more chaotic.

"[[At a moment of]{.mark} great [global instability]{.mark}]{.underline}

What will it take **[[to restore America's dip]{.mark}lomatic
[cap]{.mark}ability]{.underline}**? For starters, **[[we need to restore
funding, restore staffing, reduce time spent servicing cumbersome
bureaucratic processes]{.mark} [and manage risk]{.mark}
smartly]{.underline}**. Doing so will enable the Foreign Service to
forge and foster the relationships that, per the NSS, "the United States
calls upon when confronting security threats, responding to crises, and
encouraging others to share the burden for tackling the world's
challenges."

Restore funding. Fresh off the overwhelming bipartisan vote to reject
deep cuts to spending on foreign affairs, we are thankful that Congress
stopped the bleeding, but note that holding spending steady is not the
same as upgrading diplomatic capability.

**[[America's spending on core diplomacy has declined
sharply]{.mark}---from a dollar in 2008]{.underline}** (the last year of
the Bush 43 administration) **[to just 76 cents in 2016 and
2017]{.underline}**---while China's spending has increased dramatically
(up 40 percent over the last five years, while ours is down 33 percent).
China now has 268 diplomatic missions, just behind America's 273.

Although U.S. military spending, at \$700 billion, is greater than the
next 10 countries combined, **[[spending on core diplomacy]{.mark} (just
\$5 billion) [is barely]{.mark} enough to keep us [ahead of]{.mark}
other [rising powers.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Restore staffing. Congress has made clear its intention that the funding
approved by both houses be used to resume hiring of new diplomats and to
rebuild staffing. In addition, promotion numbers need to be restored to
at least the levels called for in the department's own workforce
planning reports---that is, at least 102 promotions into the Senior
Foreign Service each year.

We also need a concerted effort to end gaps in specialist staffing and
to restore staffing at embassies, at least to "pre-Iraq tax" levels.
Doing so will not only enable the mentoring necessary to grow the next
generation of Foreign Service leaders, it will unleash the high-impact
diplomacy described in the NSS.

Streamline bureaucratic processes. **[[Once members of the Foreign
Service are deployed overseas, they need to be freed to do their
jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Establish a baseline of how much time
they spend on bureaucracy and set a goal to reduce that by a fixed
percentage each year.]{.underline}**

Manage risk smartly. Then **[[we must forge and foster the relationships
necessary to sustain America's global leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
We can't do that crouching behind sandbags. We need to be able to get
off the compound and make contact. To do that, we need to manage risk
according to established best practices, weighing and documenting
risk-benefit trade-offs.

#### Diplomatic capital is a [myth]{.underline}

**Sahay 14,** assistant editor at War on the Rocks. (Usha,
"Over-commitment is not the problem," 04-01-2014, *War on the Rocks,*
http://warontherocks.com/2014/04/over-commitment-is-not-the-problem)

In a recent essay, Harvard professor Stephen Walt offers an explanation
for the [Obama]{.underline} administration['s foreign policy
shortcomings]{.underline}: the President and his team [suffer, Walt
contends, from "the classic problem of over-commitment]{.underline}."
The "Solve-Everything, Do-Nothing White House" has [naively taken on too
many problems without a clear sense of what its top priorities
are]{.underline}. This, in Walt's telling, is how the administration has
come up short on Iran, Middle East peace, Ukraine, and a host of other
issues. [But a closer examination reveals that the **diagnosis of
"over-commitment" doesn't explain**]{.underline} as
**[much]{.underline}** Walt thinks it does. Rather than illuminating the
current failures of our foreign policy, [[the idea of **diplomatic
overstretch**]{.mark} simply [serves as **a distraction**]{.mark} **from
what's really wrong**]{.underline}. Walt's grim appraisal of the
supposedly over-committed Obama administration begins with the thorny
issues of Iran and Israel/Palestine. These enthusiastic initiatives
spearheaded by John Kerry, Walt argues, have been stalled by a host of
factors, including opposition from AIPAC and Israel, the skittishness of
allies, expended political capital, and butting heads with Netanyahu on
two fronts at once. The problem for Walt's argument is that---with the
possible exception of the last item---[nothing on that list is a result
of over-commitment. [Iran and Middle East]{.mark} peace [aren't]{.mark}
proving [tough to solve because Obama has taken on]{.mark} **[too many
things]{.mark}**; [it's because]{.mark} [he's taken on]{.mark} [**hard
things**. Even if Obama had decided]{.mark} that Iran would be [his sole
foreign policy priority]{.mark} this term, all of [the
difficulties]{.mark} Walt points to [would still be
there]{.mark}]{.underline}. Could over-commitment be a bad thing
nonetheless, making an already bad situation worse? Almost certainly.
But Walt never makes that case. He cloaks a number of substantive
criticisms of the administration's policy in the guise of a procedural
argument about how things should have been approached a different way.
Similarly, on Ukraine---where Walt seems to have the biggest bone to
pick with the Obama administration---he is unable to establish that our
inadequate response was specifically a result of too many commitments,
rather than simply a poor policy stemming from, say, misguided strategic
thinking, geopolitical realities, or the simultaneous pursuit of
conflicting goals. The diplomatically overstretched Obama "was
blindsided by events in Ukraine," Walt charges, but it's telling that
his subsequent accusations don't actually say anything about
over-commitment. Rather, Walt undercuts his own argument by tracing the
problem back in time to years before Obama was even around to mess
things up by over-committing himself. Ultimately, Walt lays the blame at
the door of "20 years of NATO expansion" and "geostrategic incompetence
of the highest order." This hypothesis, which is consistent with what a
number of analysts have concluded in these pages, proves that the
problem goes much deeper than the naïve "do-gooder-ism" of a single
administration. It's no coincidence that that the other two issues Walt
has a problem with---Iran and Israel/Palestine---are, similarly
intractable, ongoing problems that have been confounding policymakers
for longer than I've been alive. It's certainly possible that Kerry's
overenthusiastic "shuttle diplomacy" hasn't helped things, but Walt's
own logic seems to concede that the real problem goes back further than
two years. Herein lies [the problem with [the]{.mark} [over-commitment
**hypothesis**]{.mark}: it [allows us to use failures in different parts
of the world to explain one another, rather than **engaging
substantively** on **how each of those failures came to be**]{.mark}. In
fact, [the]{.mark} [internal logic]{.mark} of the over-commitment
explanation [is **circular**]{.mark}: pursuing an Iran deal is bad
because Crimea will now make it impossible, but Crimea only happened
because we were too busy pursuing an impossible Iran deal]{.underline}.
A final problem: Walt rightly points out that it's important to have a
clear set of priorities rather than trying to be everywhere and do
everything. It is strange, then, that his piece includes a laundry list
of problems that Obama has failed to prioritize, and even stranger that
he also lists a number of clearly peripheral issues, like the Malaysian
Airlines flight, that might "take over everyone's in-box in the
days/weeks/months ahead." By reminding us of all of the other global
hotspots we're not paying attention to, isn't Walt essentially arguing
that Obama should be taking on every problem in the world? In other
words, endorsing the exact idea that this essay is supposed to critique?
It doesn't make sense to argue that the Obama administration has made
too many commitments and to then name a bunch of other commitments it
should have made. The fact that Walt ends up in [this logical double
bind reveals that [his disagreement]{.mark} **[is not]{.mark}** [with
the extent of]{.mark} the administration's [commitments]{.mark}, [it's
with the **nature**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} those [commitments]{.mark} --
that is, with what has and hasn't been deemed a top
priority]{.underline}. When Walt argues, for instance, that Syria and
Afghanistan were neglected in the rush to take on other problems, he's
not really saying that the Obama administration took on too much, he's
saying that it took on the wrong things. And that's a perfectly valid
criticism. But to fully make that critique, we have to actually explain
why, say, Iran or Israel is less important than Syria, Afghanistan, or
Crimea. And those are incredibly hard explanations to give, both for
politicians and for analysts. That's why it's easier for critics to make
process-level arguments about how the administration hasn't given
sufficient attention to this, or left sufficient bandwidth for that. The
narrative of "over-commitment" is a rhetorically convenient way to unify
all of one's disagreements with the administration under a single
explanatory factor. But proving a causal relationship between the level
of commitment and the policy outcome requires concrete evidence to show
that, had commitment levels been different, the outcome would have been
significantly better (and Adam Elkus has already shown us that
counterfactuals are hard). Absent that evidence, over-commitment is
little more than low-hanging fruit for those with grievances against the
administration, and a poor conceptual framework for understanding why
things go wrong in foreign policy.

**Ribar 14**, guest contributor to the Diplomatic Courier. (Matthew,
"How Much Diplomacy is Too Much?" 6-6-2014,
http://www.diplomaticourier.com/how-much-diplomacy-is-too-much/)

President Obama's recent commencement speech at West Point (full
transcript here) provoked a variety of reactions, but **[[one frequently
heard claim]{.mark} is that the President is trying to do too much in
terms of diplomacy, stretching too thinly the U.S.'s limited supply of
diplomatic capital]{.underline}**. For example, Shannon Tiezzi at The
Diplomat argues that President Obama is once again ignoring his
much-vaunted pivot to Asia in favor of embroiling himself in the Middle
East. The speech, Tiezzi asserted, showed that the administration's
**[[diplomatic efforts are]{.mark}
[overstretched]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and that "the Asia-Pacific region
still plays second fiddle to more traditional areas of U.S. concern."
These criticisms come in the wake of Secretary of State John Kerry's
involvement in the failure to secure a deal at peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The collapse of the talks, some
say, confirms allegations that Kerry overestimates his capabilities as
Secretary of State. Senator John McCain has called Kerry a "human
wrecking ball." Kori Schake argues that Kerry must "prioritize," and
that "Many countries in the region argue that if only the United States
would put a little effort and attention to the problem, if it would lean
just a little on the Israelis over whom we have such enormous leverage,
there could be justice for Palestinians, thus removing a major obstacle
to public support for the United States throughout the region." By the
sound of the pundits and foreign policy wonks, general agreement exists
in the foreign policy community that Kerry and Obama have bitten off
more than they can chew. However, on Monday, the Teaching, Research, and
International Policy (T.R.I.P.) project at the College of William & Mary
published the results of the most recent snap poll. Though a small
number of individual I.R. scholars write blogs or publish in policy
journals like Foreign Policy or Foreign Affairs, the snap polls are an
innovative way to provide systematic evidence on the views of I.R.
scholars regarding contemporary policy issues. These snap polls aim to
connect academia to the policy world by identifying and communicating
opinions of scholars in the academic I.R. community. On the most recent
snap poll, scholars were asked if "heavy diplomatic involvement by the
United States in Ukraine, Syria, the South China Sea, and Iranian
nuclear talks hampered U.S. efforts to facilitate Middle East peace
talks." This question has direct relevance to President Obama's speech:
if the U.S. has too much on its plate in terms of diplomacy, then it
would be counterproductive to lean even more heavily on the already
overstretched diplomatic tools available to U.S. policy makers. In fact,
**[[there is broad consensus amongst I.R.
scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of the respondents, 71.4 percent of
scholars reported **[[that heavy diplomatic involvement]{.mark} by the
U.S. [around the world did not hamper]{.mark} U.S. [efforts to
facilitate]{.mark} [Middle East peace talks.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Only
16.8 percent of scholars answered "yes" (11.8 percent responded "don't
know"). Often, the academic community faces allegations of liberal bias.
These range from memoirs about a conservative academic being met "with
enmity, suspicion, and a refusal to engage in reasoned debate" to
Senator Rick Santorum's famous response to President Obama wanting every
American to go to college: "what a snob." So, perhaps liberal professors
are blindly following the president in foreign policy. If this were the
case, one would expect a much larger ratio of "yes" answers among
conservatives. The following chart shows responses to the snap poll
question broken down according to political ideology and gender: Matt
Ribar Graph 2 Variations are underwhelming, and consensus is again
strong: 18.8 percent of conservatives replied that the U.S. is stretched
too thin diplomatically, whereas 16 percent of liberals also agreed.
That difference, 2.8 percent, is minuscule. Gender played a bigger role
in responses than ideology, with women more likely to say that the U.S.
is overstretched. But even amongst women, 60.7 percent replied "no."
T.R.I.P. also conducts more substantive polls every few years. One
question asked on the larger 2011 T.R.I.P. poll was "how much influence,
on a scale of one to ten, will the U.S. have on the world in 2020." An
answer of 10 means that the scholar thought the U.S. would be very
influential in 2020. Broadly, scholars who think the U.S. will be more
influential in 2020 are less likely to say that the U.S. is
overstretched diplomatically. Even amongst those with the gloomiest
opinions of the U.S.'s future effect on the world overwhelmingly answer
"no." Only 16.6 percent of those who said the influence of the U.S.
would be from 1 to 2 and 23.2 percent of those who responded with
answers from 3 to 4 said that the U.S. was overstretched diplomatically.

takeaway is that **[[even though there are]{.mark} certainly plenty of

#### Attack on Iran thumps -- nuclear proliferation now

**Cirincione 25** - vice-chair of the Center for International Policy

Iran could still make a nuclear weapon --- even if the U.S. strikes",
https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-israel-us-nuclear-war-risks-rcna213653)
// EW

Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned in 2012 that an **[[attack
on Iran]{.mark} "[would make]{.mark} a [nuclear-armed Iran
inevitable]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[They would just bury the program
deeper and make it more covert]{.underline}**." Yes, we could damage the
nuclear facilities, but what happens then? "The results of an American
or Israeli military strike on Iran could, in my view, prove
catastrophic, haunting us for generations in that part of the world," he
added.

Gates, the defense secretary under both Presidents George W. Bush and
Barack Obama, was not alone. There is a reason that the United States
has not gone to war with Iran before. The overwhelming consensus of
military and intelligence officials and experts has been that doing so
would be a disaster.

"President George W. Bush's administration concluded that **[[a]{.mark}
military [strike on Iran's]{.mark} nuclear [facilities]{.mark} would be
a bad idea]{.underline}** --- and **[[would]{.mark} only [make it harder
to prevent Iran from going nuclear]{.mark} in the
future]{.underline}**," former CIA Director Michael Hayden said, also in
2012.

"**[After you've dropped those bombs on those hardened
facilities]{.underline}**, what happens next?" former Central Command
chief Anthony Zinni asked in 2009. **[[There could be
catastrophic]{.mark} economic, political and military [consequences on a
global scale]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The nuclear consequences alone
should terrify us.]{.underline}**

It is possible that U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, coupled with
Israel's sustained bombing of Iranian political and economic targets,
could cause the Iranian government to collapse, or agree to President
Donald Trump's demand for "unconditional surrender."

But **[[it is]{.mark} more [likely that Iran]{.mark} could [race to
build]{.mark} [nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[It could
produce]{.mark} enough uranium for the cores of [10
bombs]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a matter of days. It is unknown how long
it would then take to turn the uranium into metal, shape it into weapons
and then assemble it into one or more devices. U.S. intelligence
agencies have assessed that it would take a year or more, but **[Iran
could find shortcuts and do it [as little as three to five weeks]{.mark}
--- as China did in 1964.]{.underline}**

**[Iran]{.underline}** does not have to create a modern, sophisticated
warhead that could fit on the tip of a missile. **[It could assemble a
crude device that resembles the bomb the United States used to destroy
Hiroshima 80 years ago.]{.underline}** It could put that bomb in a
plane, a truck or the belly of a cargo ship and smuggle it into the
territory of a U.S. ally, or America itself.

Iran might also explode a bomb in its own deserts, demonstrating that it
has now become a nuclear power, and threaten to use it unless Israel and
the United States stop their attacks. This would be in addition to other
potential actions that officials and experts have long predicted, such
as closing the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off one-fifth of the world's
oil supplies and triggering a global recession; attacking U.S. troops in
the region; and terrorist attacks on U.S. interests and economic targets
around the world.

It is worth remembering that the **[nuclear risks do not just stem from
Iran.]{.underline}** **[Of the three countries involved in this war, two
are nuclear-armed nations]{.underline}**. If Iranian missiles were to
kill hundreds in Tel Aviv, would Israel decide to launch its
nuclear-tipped missiles on Tehran? Or if the Iranians sink one of the
three U.S. carriers now heading to the region, would Trump cross the
nuclear line? We have been fortunate that **[no nation has used a
nuclear weapon in combat in 80 years. This war could end that
streak.]{.underline}**

**[[Even if]{.mark} the [attacks on Iran succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}**
--- if Iranian centrifuges and uranium stocks are destroyed ---
**[[nuclear risks will multiply]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[Nations]{.mark} around the world may [conclude that only]{.mark} [a
nuclear weapon]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [save them from]{.mark} conventional
military [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Right now, our own European
allies worry that Trump's retreat from fully supporting Ukraine --- and
budding alliance with Russia --- means that if the U.S. nuclear umbrella
no longer protects them, then they had better build their own.

**[[War with Iran]{.mark} may also [be the final blow]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the already tottering [nuclear nonproliferation
regime]{.mark}.]{.underline}** President George W.
**[Bush]{.underline}** began **[weakening the nuclear
guardrails]{.underline}** when he **[withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty in 2002]{.underline}** (promising a national missile
shield that never materialized), and withdr**[awing from the 1994
agreement that had blocked North Korea's nuclear program]{.underline}**
(now fully developed, including missiles that can hit the United
States).

**[[Trump and]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russian President Vladimir
**[[Putin]{.mark} accelerated the disintegration]{.underline}** of
global nuclear norms **[by [withdrawing]{.mark} [from]{.mark} three
other [agreements]{.mark}. The [sole]{.mark} remaining
[treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}** limiting nuclear arms, the New START
treaty, **[[expires next year]{.mark} with no replacement in
sight.]{.underline}**

**[[This]{.mark} war]{.underline}** could **[[cause]{.mark} many
[countries]{.mark} in Europe and Asia [to]{.mark}]{.underline}**
conclude that they must **[[pull out of]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}uclear
Non-[P]{.mark}roliferation [T]{.mark}reaty]{.underline}**, ending five
decades of nuclear restraint. We would be plunged back into the nuclear
anarchy of the 1950s and 1960s when dozens of countries had nuclear
weapons programs.

These are the kind of "possible unintended consequences of a strike"
that former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. Mike Mullen warned about
in 2009. Yet, we have had nothing like the sustained, serious debates
that accompanied previous Iranian crises. **[[Trump acts alone]{.mark},
[ignoring advice and]{.mark} the [Constitution]{.mark} to decide if he
"may or may not" attack.]{.underline}**

With **[[three unstable]{.mark}, unpopular [leaders facing
off]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the stakes could not be higher, **[the
[consequences more unpredictable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We are rolling
the nuclear dice. **[This is unlikely to end well.]{.underline}**

https://time.com/7297464/nuclear-diplomacy-iran-us-strikes-damage-non-proliferation-treaty-weapon/
//PK

[What began as a military campaign against Iran's nuclear
infrastructure may have given way to a more enduring crisis: the
collapse of decades-long efforts to contain nuclear proliferation
through diplomacy.]{.underline}

After days of escalating airstrikes between Israel and Iran that killed
hundreds in Iran and dozens in Israel---and the United States' decision
to involve itself---[one of the most lasting]{.underline}, and difficult
to quantify, [losses may be the fragile framework of international
nuclear cooperation.]{.underline}

While the full scope of physical damage to Iran's nuclear facilities
remains unclear, [analysts warn that the attacks may have pushed Iran to
the brink of abandoning the]{.underline} Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty ([NPT]{.underline}), [the foundational agreement designed to
limit the spread of nuclear weapons]{.underline} and promote peaceful
atomic energy that Iran has been a party to for five-and-a-half decades.

Iran is now "quite likely" to withdraw from the NPT under which it
pledged not to develop a bomb, warned Ali Vaez, director of the Iran
Project at the International Crisis Group. Outlining "worst-case
scenarios" in an essay for TIME, Vaez suggested: "[Over time, Iran's
regime could attempt to reconstitute its nuclear activity from the
rubble, only with an explicit aim of fashioning a weapon in the shortest
possible time as a means of deterrence in the future]{.underline}."

Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in
Washington, D.C., said in a post on X that [Iran's nuclear program "has
at best been set back, but certainly not destroyed, while dramatically
increasing Tehran's determination to achieve nuclear
deterrence."]{.underline} He added that [Iran having a damaged but not
fully dismantled nuclear program makes any future peace]{.underline}
between Iran and Israel [even more precarious.]{.underline}

The **[key area where to [Iran]{.mark} might [seek collaborate with
Russia]{.mark} is nuclear technology]{.underline}**. However, this
potential partnership is limited by Russia\'s own interests. Moscow is
likely to prefer that **[[Iran doesn\'t develop nuclear weapons, unless

the **[[war in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[Russia had supported

includes joint military exercises and advanced arms sales, enhancing
China\'s ability to contest U.S.-led coalitions. Despite sanctions,
Russia has turned to North Korea for munitions, exacerbating regional
instability. North Korea\'s nuclear ambitions are escalating, with the

#### Iran perceives a nuclear deal as leverage

News Investigative Unit. "Can Iran secretly build a nuclear weapon
without being caught by Israel?
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/can-iran-secretly-build-nuclear-bomb-caught-israel-rcna215038.
//PK

**[[Despite the unprecedented damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is
still being assessed, **[[it's possible Iran may have the technical
means to relaunch a weapons program]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- including
enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground
sites, some **[[arms control experts say.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Iran's entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be
accounted for]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[[it has an unknown number
of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by
Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**, NBC News has reported.

Iran's most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing
uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert
uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it
in Isfahan.

Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a
facility, and it's unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal
product plant elsewhere.

Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb
ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than
technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control
expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.

"It really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said.
\"They still have a lot of capability left.\"

After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel's
air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend
itself and preserve the regime's survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum,
a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor
at the University of Illinois.

**[["Iran has every reason now, based on what's just happened, to say
we've got to have a bomb, \[and\] we'll be treated differently if we
do,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Weinbaum said.

Officials in Iran's regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear
weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a
compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances
required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons
will help ensure the regime's survival or endanger its grip on power,
regional analysts said.

However, Kelsey Davenport, director for non-proliferation policy at the

**[[Israel]{.mark}\'s prime minister \"[did not present any]{.mark}
clear or compelling [evidence that Iran was]{.mark} on the brink of

\"Iran has been at a near-zero breakout for months,\" she told the BBC,
referring to the time it would take Iran to acquire enough fissile
material for one bomb if it chose to do so.

\"Similarly, the assessment that Iran could develop a crude nuclear
weapon within a few months is not new.\"

She said some of Iran\'s nuclear activities would be applicable to
developing a bomb, but **[[US intelligence

\"Can everything be rebuilt eventually? Sure. But there's no question
[[the program was rolled back -- years, if not

\"There's no verified answer yet to what happened to the 60% enriched

\"If Iran has access to advanced centrifuges, they could in theory

bottleneck,\" she said. But she warned that nuclear weapons technology
is not insurmountable: \"This is 1940s science. If North Korea could do
it, Iran could too -- eventually.\"

According to the ISIS report, \"[[extensive damage\" was confirmed at
nearly all major]{.underline}]{.mark} Iranian nuclear and missile
[[facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the destruction of uranium
metal conversion plants, fuel fabrication centers, and the IR-40 Arak
heavy water reactor. The report noted that the Israeli and U.S. strikes
\"rendered the Fordow site inoperable,\" citing high-resolution
satellite imagery of deep bunker penetrations.

Rabinowitz also emphasized that the intelligence picture is still
developing in real time. \"The Israelis and the Americans are now hard
at work to generate the most accurate intelligence picture they can,\"
she said. \"Without having my own sources in the Mossad, I can guarantee
the Israelis are monitoring internal Iranian communications, trying to
figure out what the Iranians have figured out. As they learn more, so

Tehran\'s Supreme National Security Council.

in a statement.

There are three strategies Saudi Arabia could adopt if it did seek the
bomb: sheltered pursuit, sprinting, and hiding. The strategy of
sheltered pursuit describes a pathway to nuclear weapons that depends on
the support of a major power. In this strategy, a major power protects
the nuclear aspirant from rivals' efforts to interfere with its nuclear
pursuit. In this case, **[[Riyadh]{.mark} would [rely on the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to provide shelter and deter
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is likely Saudi Arabia's preferred
pathway because it enables nuclear aspirants to pursue nuclear weapons
more efficiently and openly. Major power patronage can prevent military,
economic, and diplomatic counterproliferation actions. However, **[it is
[unlikely]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
would [support Saudi Arabia]{.mark}'s [nuclear
pursuit]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[prefer]{.mark}s for its [allies not to have nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} so that escalation and nuclear use remain entirely
within Washington's purview]{.underline}**. Further, Saudi Arabia would
need reactors and gas centrifuges to build nuclear weapons and **[[there
has been opposition from Congress and Israel to]{.mark} a [U.S.-Saudi
nuclear]{.mark} energy [deal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is unlikely
Congress would approve of a deal without stringent proliferation
safeguards]{.underline}**. Moreover, if the United States did grant
Saudi Arabia those facilities and technologies without a prohibition on
enrichment, it would set a precedent for other allies to demand similar
privileges.

The "sprinting" strategy describes an active, rapid, and open pursuit of
nuclear weapons. Sprinting has historically been successful with France,
India, the PRC, the USSR, and the United States all employing it.
However, sprinting often requires immunity from military and economic
preventive action, such as sanctions or strikes on nuclear facilities.
**[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia is [vulnerable to]{.mark} both [Iran]{.mark}ian
military [countermeasures]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a [U.S. arms
embargo]{.mark}. It also [lacks the reactors and equipment
needed]{.mark} to sprint to the bomb]{.underline}**.

Although there are countries that could provide Saudi Arabia with these
technologies---the PRC, United States, France, Russia, and South Korea
among them---**[[a lack of uranium enrichment capabilities]{.mark} is
currently the [chief obstacle to]{.mark} a Saudi sprint to the
[bomb]{.mark}]{.underline}**. U.S. **[allies South Korea and
France]{.underline}** are **[unlikely to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear
reactors]{.underline}** without a strict nonproliferation agreement.
Sanctions against Russia render it an unattractive partner for Saudi
Arabia. The PRC has close economic and military ties to Iran and even
designed an Iranian uranium-conversion facility. However, the PRC has
partnered with Saudi Arabia on uranium prospecting, brokered an effort
at Saudi-Iranian rapprochement in 2023, and supplied Saudi Arabia with
dual-capable ballistic missiles. Although the PRC might eventually balk
at providing Saudi Arabia with nuclear reactors that can produce
weapons-grade nuclear material, it covets Saudi Arabian oil and has a
track record of nuclear partnership with the kingdom. Either way, Saudi
Arabia considers the PRC its best bet to secure nuclear reactors if the
United States declines to do so.

The strategy of 'hiding' differs from sprinting in that it privileges
secrecy over rapidity. Saudi Arabia is a good candidate for a hiding
strategy. The international community knows little about nuclear
activity within the kingdom. Its secretive decision-making and secluded
desert areas that could house underground nuclear facilities would also
aid a hiding strategy. Nonetheless, **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia still
[cannot enrich uranium to weapons grade]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Efforts
to enlist outside help could alert others to its nuclear weapons
program. If Iran builds nuclear weapons first, Mohammed bin Salman's
prior statement would direct international scrutiny toward Saudi
Arabia's nuclear activities.

Obstacles To The Bomb

Even if Saudi Arabia adopted an active pursuit strategy, it would take
years before it built a finished nuclear weapon. **[[Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [lacks the dual-use technology]{.mark} needed to build
weapons-grade nuclear material]{.underline}**, and nuclear **[[warheads
are difficult to construct]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A **[Saudi Arabian
nuclear weapons program]{.underline}** could also **[elicit reprisals
from Iran]{.underline}**. In 2019, the Islamic Republic used its missile
and drone capabilities to cripple a Saudi oil processing facility. It
could l**[aunch similar assaults on Saudi Arabia's nuclear
infrastructure.]{.underline}** Furthermore, the United States might levy
sanctions on the Kingdom or offer Saudi Arabia its long sought after
formal defense relationship. Lengthy time frames and a need to secure
enrichment capabilities from abroad provide the United States with the
opportunity to preempt Saudi Arabia before it is too late.

**[It is a widely held belief among policymakers and experts that [Saudi
Arabia does not possess a nuclear weapons
program]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This consensus is based on **[[Saudi
Arabia's strong condemnation of nuclear weapons]{.mark} and the
country's claim that [it has no intention of acquiring
them]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Additionally, **[[Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}** and other Arab states have long **[[advocated for
a Mid]{.mark}dle [East devoid of nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
However, some experts have pointed out that Saudi Arabia possesses both
the strategic motivation and financial means to pursue nuclear weapons.

In reality, **[Saudi Arabia is]{.underline}** both
**[vulnerable]{.underline}** and affluent, and it has long felt
threatened by the revolutionary victory of its Shi'ite foe across the
Gulf. This vulnerability, coupled with its significant financial
resources, has led some experts to believe that Saudi Arabia may attempt
to acquire nuclear weapons if its national security is compromised.

Despite these concerns, **[Saudi Arabia is a [party to]{.mark} both the
Non-Proliferation Treaty ([NPT]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} the [IAEA]{.mark}
safeguards framework]{.underline}**. The nation signed the NPT
reluctantly, but this had nothing to do with a desire to develop nuclear
weapons. **[[Since joining]{.mark} the International Atomic Energy
Agency, [Saudi Arabia has worked hard to fulfill its obligations]{.mark}
under the IAEA's "Milestones Approach," a three-step plan leading
[to]{.mark} the [launch]{.mark} of [a nuclear power
facility]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia has also acknowledged that
NPT signatories have the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes.

A significant portion **[of [Saudi Arabia's nuclear arsenal is motivated
by its desire for renewable energy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The country
has been constructing a clean and secure nuclear energy program for
quite some time. In 2010, the nuclear research project was initiated to
establish "a sustainable future for Saudi Arabia by constructing a
substantial alternative energy capability supported by world-class local
businesses." To advance its nuclear reactor initiative, the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia has established King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and
Technology (KACST). KACST collaborated with the King Abdullah City for
Atomic and Renewable Energy (K.A.CARE) and other foreign experts to
design the Saudi project's reactors, which will be used to realize the
country's 2030 vision for sustainable energy.

**[[Saudi Arabia is committed to]{.mark} its national policy of
[openness, dependability, and security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this
context, the country is striving to develop peaceful nuclear
applications in a variety of fields, including its national nuclear
energy program. While there are rational considerations in favor of
nuclear energy security for Saudi Arabia, it is highly unlikely that the
country will opt for nuclear weapons. The negative international
reaction to **[Saudi Arabia's [pursuit of nuclear weapons is likely to
weaken rather than empower the country]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} has articulated its position on nuclear
security and is [committed to]{.mark} its long-held goal of rendering
the entire Middle East a [nuclear-free zone and]{.mark} emphasizing the
importance of adherence to the NPT]{.underline}**. To achieve this
objective, Saudi Arabia seeks international community support for its
resolutions. Saudi Arabia emphasizes the significance of adherence to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and safeguards its rights to use
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to invest in its natural
resources in a nuclear-threat-free environment. Saudi Arabia urges the
international community to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free world so
that the conditions of the Treaty can be thoroughly implemented. **[The
country [urges all nations that have not signed the Nuclear
N]{.mark}on-[P]{.mark}roliferation [T]{.mark}reaty.]{.underline}**

However, it is also important to note that the Saudi nuclear program
should be subject to international scrutiny to ensure that it remains
peaceful and transparent. The international community must work together
to strengthen safeguards for nuclear technology and promote transparency
and accountability in order to prevent proliferation and maintain global
security.

the Nuclear Rumour Mill", Survival, Vol. 57, No. 4, pp.105-108.;Accessed
07-16-2025; KK\]

**[Pakistan is the usual suspect]{.underline}**. It has **[close ties
with Saudi Arabia, and benefited from Saudi munificence when its
nuclear-weapons programme was getting off the ground]{.underline}**.
Every couple of years a media scoop alleges that Pakistan is on the
verge of transferring nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia. A thinly sourced
article in the Sunday Times on 15 May 2015 is a recent example, claiming
that Saudi Arabia has taken a 'strategic decision' to acquire 'off-
the-shelf' nuclear weapons from Pakistan.7 Whatever the Saudis may have
decided, however, a transfer requires a willing supplier. As I argued
last year in my Adelphi book, Overcoming Pakistan's Nuclear Dangers,
**[[Pakistan has strong strategic, political and economic incentives to
keep]{.mark} its [nuclear weapons to itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**.8
Just as the **[Pakistanis resolutely [refused Saudi Arabia's request for
aircraft and ground forces]{.mark} to support the Yemen
intervention]{.underline}**, 9 **[[so]{.mark} too [they would refuse a
nuclear-weapons transfer]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Very little in the Sunday Times article is credible. Take this line,
purport-edly from a US intelligence official: 'We know this stuff is
available to them off the shelf.' The US intelligence community includes
17 separate agencies and over 800,000 US officials hold top-secret
clearances.10 No doubt report-ers can find at least one of them whom
they can quote repeating what has been in previous press reports. 11 But
responsible intelligence officials do not speak that way. **[Those who
know something not speak that way about [Pakistan]{.mark}'s nuclear
programme know that it [has no nuclear weapons 'on the shelf']{.mark}
waiting for delivery to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. **[[Pakistan's
nuclear arsenal is focused]{.mark} entirely [on
India]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Opening up a second front on its west
by [becoming involved in the Saudi--Iran dispute would be a]{.mark}
strategic [blunder]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The real danger is that Saudi money could lure Pakistani nuclear
scientists to give it a head start on developing weapons technology.
There is precedent: two retired Pakistani nuclear scientists met with
al-Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan in August 2001 to discuss uranium
enrichment and other aspects of weapons development.12 Following that
revelation, the military's **[Strategic Plans Division]{.underline}**,
which **[oversees [Pakistan's nuclear programme, tightened]{.mark} its
[personnel]{.mark}-reliability programme [to keep a close watch]{.mark}
not just over currently serving nuclear scientists, but also those who
are retired. [Those with the most knowledge are kept on in advisory
capacities, reducing any incentive to break away]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
13

Few details about that watch programme are known publicly: how many
retired scientists it covers, how they are monitored and how well the
pro-gramme is funded, for example. We can assume concerned governments
are quietly asking these questions. **[[When]{.mark} Pakistani
[officials are asked]{.mark} about the Saudi-related allegations,
[they]{.mark} flatly [deny any chance of a nuclear
transfer]{.mark}]{.underline}**.14 I trust their intentions, but it
would be good to know that the monitoring programme is robustly
implemented, with redundant controls.

The [[lack of]{.mark} a [meaningful response from]{.mark} the so-called
"[Axis of Resistance]{.mark}" to the Israel-Iran war]{.underline}
reveals how exhausted it is after months of fighting the United States
and Israel. [[Iranian proxy and partner militias]{.mark} appear either
[unable]{.mark} or unwilling [to support Iran]{.mark} in any serious
way.]{.underline} [Hezbollah and Hamas are probably unable. The [Houthis
and Iraqi militias appear]{.mark} largely
[unwilling.]{.mark}]{.underline} These groups remain capable of
threatening US interests in the Middle East, of course. But the extent
to which these groups have remained largely uninvolved so far reflects
an **[[unraveling of the Iranian regional militia
network]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has long been considered the
primary Iranian means of retaliating against adversary attacks. Whatever
happens in the days and weeks ahead, Iran will emerge from this conflict
badly wounded, at home and abroad.

Hamas began this war on October 7, 2023, and embroiled Iran and its
proxy and partner militias in a two-year conflict that badly undermined
Iran's ability to deter Israel and set the stage for the ongoing Israeli
air campaign. Iran's proxy network began attacking Israel and US forces
in the region by mid-October, which regionalized the war.\[1\] These
attacks, which relied solely on rockets, drones, and missiles, did not
meaningfully alter Israel's calculations in the Gaza Strip, though they
did threaten Israel's citizens and economy.\[2\] Israel badly damaged
Hamas despite the proxy attacks from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen,
and rendered Hamas unable to deter or threaten Israel for the
foreseeable future.\[3\] The [damage Hamas suffered has made it
irrelevant in the current round of conflict.]{.underline}

Hezbollah attacks in northern Israel posed a significant problem for
Israel because they forced Israeli civilians in northern Israel to
evacuate their homes for over a year and had significant negative
effects on Israel's agricultural economy in northern Israel.\[4\] Israel
thus launched a three-month military campaign that badly degraded
Hezbollah and forced the group to surrender.\[5\] Iran responded by
launching a major ballistic missile attack against Israel in October
2024.\[6\] Israel stopped this attack with minimal damage and retaliated
by disabling key components of Iran's air defenses, which opened the
door for future Israeli air campaigns.\[7\] The failure of Iran's April
and October 2024 attacks on Israel to cause serious damage also
decreased Iran's deterrence vis-à-vis Israel. The Lebanon campaign
removed Hezbollah, Iran's strongest deterrent against an Israeli strike,
and the October 2024 Israeli strikes on Iran disabled the air defenses
that would attempt to stop a strike after it began.

The [[collapse of Bashar al Assad's regime]{.mark} only [exacerbated
Hezbollah's weakness]{.mark} and made Iran's regional influence decline
further]{.underline}. Iran had relied on the Assad regime since the
1980s to enable the shipment of weapons, technology, and people to
Hezbollah in Lebanon through Syria.\[8\] Iran deployed forces to Syria
in the mid-2010s to bolster the Assad regime during the civil war to
protect Assad and the supply lines he allowed.\[9\] These shipment
routes were critical to Iran's ability to help rebuild Hezbollah over
time, and their loss reduced Iran to attempting to send cash to
Hezbollah using aircraft and very small numbers of weapons
overland.\[10\] [The [Lebanese government]{.mark}, empowered by
Hezbollah's weakness, has for the first time [moved to stop]{.mark}
these [shipments]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[11\]

[Other Iranian [proxies and partners]{.mark}]{.underline}, while not as
badly damaged, [appear [unwilling]{.mark} and partly unable [to]{.mark}
seriously [intervene due to]{.mark} their respective
[challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} Both the Houthis and the
Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have weathered US airstrikes in the last
two years more or less intact, though not without suffering damage. The
Houthis have continued to attack Israel after the Israeli campaign
began, but they use the same missiles and drones that Iran uses and thus
face the same challenges in conducting such long-range attacks. The
distances involved give Israel ample time to shoot down the drones, and
Iranian-built missiles have only a limited ability to penetrate Israeli
defenses, strike significant targets, and impact Israeli
decision-making.\[12\] The Iraqi groups had even less success than the
Houthis in targeting Israel: none of their drones struck major Israeli
targets, and only one caused serious casualties.\[13\] [These groups
could resume attacks on Israel, but **[they are in competition with one
another]{.mark}** domestically [ahead of the November 2025 Iraqi
elections]{.mark} and are [reluctant to be drawn into]{.mark} the
Iran-Israel [conflict.]{.mark}\[14\]]{.underline}

### !---AT: Middle East War---AT: Russia-China Draw In---1AR

#### Regional actors and foreign powers are unlikely to intervene in a middle east conflict -- laundry list of warrants 

**Moneta Group 25** \[Moneta Group; one of the nation\'s premier

Accessed 7-16-2025; VB\]

Earlier this year, Moneta had the opportunity to speak with The Carlyle
Group's, [Admiral James Stavridis]{.underline}, who provided some
perspectives on the current geopolitical environment (a full summary of
the conversation can be found here). Regarding the Middle East, the
Admiral noted: ["[Israel]{.mark} has really [established **"escalation
dominance**" over the last year with the Houthis]{.mark} in Yemen the
only legitimate adversary at this time. [Iran]{.mark} is [reeling from
losses incurred by Hezbollah]{.mark} in Lebanon]{.underline} and the
regime change as Syria's Assad was ousted by a rebel group. This
portends [[lower risk of additional escalation and less appetite for
Iran to respond]{.mark} especially with President-elect Trump to take
office shortly]{.underline}. Iran itself is in an interesting domestic
situation which its government and leadership will have to address or
events may do it for them. The country is [demographically very youthful
and with over 52% of its]{.underline} \~90 million [people under the age
of 35. There is [clear discontent by younger generations]{.mark} with
the theocracy]{.underline} that Iran operates under."

The Admiral's comments were clearly informed and credible back in
January. However, since then, Israel's risk calculus clearly changed
significantly with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) finding
Iran in breach of its Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations and ongoing
intelligence assessments of Iran's nuclear program. This prompted Israel
to take full advantage of Iran's losses and domestic vulnerabilities by
directly attacking the nation, in hopes of eliminating Iran's nuclear
program that Israel views as an existential threat to their nation's
existence.

From a market perspective, a disruption to the supply of oil remains the
key risk, though this is somewhat contained as Iran's oil exports are
estimated to be around 1.7 million barrels per day, almost entirely
going to China given strict economic sanctions on Iran. Any reduction in
Iran's supply could likely be brought back online quickly, given
significant stockpiles from nearby Saudi Arabia and the UAE. More
importantly, Iran has the potential ability to shut down the Strait of
Hormuz, a key chokepoint in the global distribution of oil, though this
is generally seen as a last-ditch effort as it would likely pull the US
into the conflict and quickly alienate key allies, such as China, who
depend on the route for oil supplies.

As we write, markets have largely brushed off these risks. While oil
remains elevated, up more than 8% since June 12th, the absolute level is
relatively low compared to recent history and only marginally higher
from where it started at the beginning of the year.

Why is this a big deal? There are deep cultural roots in this conflict
that cannot be overlooked. Persian Iran is broadly seen as the standard
bearer for Shia Islam, backing (financially and militarily) multiple
allied state and non-state actors in the broader region, including
groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and the Gaza Strip\[1\].
Additionally, Iran has generally been seen as an ally of Russia and
China, though it is typically viewed as an "enemy of my enemy" situation
rather than a like-minded alliance. The magnitude of the current
situation and subsequent fallout will likely depend on whether Israel
contains the escalation to "simply" destroying Iran's nuclear
capabilities or if they seek a complete collapse of the current Iranian
regime -- the former opens the door to potential treaties that allows
the current government to "save face", the latter could result in
significant instability in the broader region. For investors, increased
instability could lead to higher oil prices and supply chain disruptions
leading to delays and higher shipping costs.

War brings with it many scenarios of how things could ultimately play
out. Many well-informed pundits are watching each and every move of
Iran, Israel and the US -- militarily and diplomatically -- to assess
likely outcomes, knowing full well the "fog of war" reigns supreme even
in these early stages. Many questions abound on the ultimate end game of
Israel, capacity of Iran to continue its attack on Israel, it's
populace's willingness to support its theocratic regime and importantly,
the US's appetite and willingness to participate more fully in this
conflict.

While the range of scenarios are too numerous to detail, below are some
of the "more likely" potential outcomes:

Under mounting losses and internal pressure, Iran capitulates fully to
the West's demands for complete dismantling of existing and planned
pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Would Iran "surrender" their nuclear ambitions this easily and will it
allow its current leadership to maintain power and legitimacy?

Israel ends its military campaign following a thorough destruction of
Iran's current nuclear bomb producing capabilities and eliminating any
threat via direct action against facilities, knowledge base, and
supplies.

Can Israel afford to judge success as degrading the nuclear ambitions
and capabilities of Iran even without fundamental regime change?

US enters the war by targeting a key Iranian uranium enrichment
underground site -- Fordow -- to degrade Iran's weapons-grade enrichment
capabilities and destroy the suspected stockpile.

Is another Middle East intervention by US military assets, which risks
widening the conflict, something US government or its populace is
willing to stand behind?

[[Russian involvement seems unlikely given the war in Ukraine]{.mark}
that rages on with no end in sight]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the success
of Western technology on the battlefield in Ukraine, the fall of the
Russian-backed Assad region in Syria, and the decimation of Iran's
allies and defenses has not gone unnoticed by China. As we write,
[[Chinese involvement]{.mark} in the situation has been [extremely
limited]{.mark}]{.underline} and aside from the slow and steady increase
of pressure on Taiwan, the [[military tensions with China]{.mark} remain
largely [unchanged]{.mark}]{.underline} with conflict remaining in the
economic realm of tariffs and sanctions.

into force. It [[was designed not to]{.mark} verify or [implement the
NPT]{.mark}, but to promote civilian uses of nuclear energy]{.underline}
and to account for special civilian nuclear materials that could be
diverted to make nuclear explosives. As such, the IAEA's 1957 charter
makes no mention of the NPT. See Statute of the IAEA, Oct. 23, 1956
(entered into force July 29, 1957). After the NPT came into force in
1970, t\'he IAEA negotiated agreements for nuclear inspection safeguards
to help verify that civilian nuclear programs were not being used to
make nuclear weapons. If the IAEA Board of Governors believes a country
has violated an IAEA nuclear safeguards agreements, it can report that
to the United Nations. [[The IAEA is under no clear legal
obligation]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[to determine
if]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a violation constitutes a]{.mark}
[violation of the NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [[the IAEA is
**neither equipped nor inclined** to assess]{.underline}]{.mark} other
[[possible violations of the NPT. These include]{.mark} acquiring or
**[transferring]{.mark}** nuclear weapons from or to other states,

#### Domestic security concerns outweighs international norms but any resistance would be minimal.

[[The question So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [is]{.mark} now
[asking]{.mark} itself [is not whether it is capable]{.mark} of building
nuclear weapons, [but whether]{.mark} the [benefits]{.mark} of doing so
[outweigh]{.mark} the [costs. Not only can Seoul withstand these
costs]{.mark}, [but they would]{.mark} likely [be]{.mark} far [less
severe than]{.mark} those publicly [discussed]{.mark} by the
nonproliferation community.]{.underline}

For more than half a century, the treaties, agreements, arrangements,
and verification tools that make up the global nonproliferation
regime---in particular, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT)---have largely prevented new states from developing
nuclear weapons. Key to eliciting compliance with this bargain are the
penalties and punishments imposed if states are found violating their
safeguards agreements---above all, economic sanctions. Iran and North
Korea, the most notable NPT pariahs, are among the most heavily
sanctioned countries in the world, and as a global economic powerhouse,
South Korea would stand to lose a great deal if it were subject to
similar retribution.

[Yet [So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea['s]{.mark} current [security
environment is so fraught that]{.mark} its [decision may be
understandable]{.mark} to many.]{.underline} While Seoul continues to
respect the January 1992 joint declaration on the denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula, Pyongyang has gone in the opposite direction, to
put it lightly.

[It is precisely this [threat]{.mark} that could [help Seoul
maintain]{.mark} moral and legal [high ground---and avoid]{.mark} the
kind of [backlash]{.mark} Pyongyang faced for its actions. As enshrined
in Article X of the NPT, [So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [has]{.mark} the
"[right to withdraw]{.mark}" [in]{.mark} the [case]{.mark} that it
"decides that [extraordinary events]{.mark}, related to the subject
matter of this Treaty, have [jeopardized]{.mark} the supreme interests
of [it]{.mark}s country."]{.underline} In September of last year, North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that his country's nuclear status is
"irreversible," and the rubber-stamp Supreme People's Assembly passed a
law that month enshrining Pyongyang's (self-anointed) right to launch a
preemptive nuclear strike. Meanwhile, North Korea continues to lay claim
to the whole of the Korean Peninsula. This publicly established threat
would give South Korean leaders a powerful legal case to argue that
withdrawal from the NPT to develop nuclear weapons is a matter of pure
survival.

Withdrawal from the NPT in and of itself may make South Korea the target
of criticism. But there's good reason to believe that the way in which
it develops its nuclear program could mitigate some of the reputational
costs and diplomatic fallout.

Israel, for example, is widely acknowledged to possess nuclear weapons
even though it has refrained from publicly conducting a nuclear test.
Nuclear tests are particularly inflammatory because they serve as a
vivid reminder to other countries of the threat they face---not to
mention the environmental harm these tests cause. Yet Israel's
(test-free) nuclear status has not prevented it from becoming one of
Washington's strongest allies. While the South Korean Army would ideally
want to conduct at least one nuclear test to assess and collect valuable
data on its technology, it could instead follow Israel's lead and rely
on its civilian nuclear energy know-how, computer modeling, and data
gathered from other countries' nuclear tests---including North
Korea's---to quietly develop its own program. This would certainly
reduce the reputational hit Seoul would take.

Further, as the case of India shows, the backlash from conducting a
nuclear test would not necessarily be insurmountable. The Clinton
administration criticized New Delhi's 1998 tests and imposed a series of
economic sanctions on India. But for the United States, strengthening
relations with India eventually became more important than upholding the
nonproliferation regime. Sure enough, by 2005, U.S. President George W.
Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had issued a joint
statement lifting a three-decade-old nuclear trade moratorium, and the
countries continue to cooperate across a range of issues today.

In today's geopolitical context, the Biden administration has shown a
willingness to put its security interests above all else in its
competition against China. To that end, the United States is now party
to the AUKUS security pact, whereby the United States and the United
Kingdom will share nuclear propulsion technology and, potentially,
highly enriched uranium with Australia. Although the AUKUS partners
have vehemently stated that Australia's intent is peaceful and that the
agreement doesn't undermine the NPT, some experts believe this creates a
loophole for other non-nuclear states to develop nuclear weapons outside
of the nonproliferation regime.

Critics can certainly argue that the cases of Israel, India, or now
AUKUS are different from South Korea's. Yet these cases make clear that
under certain circumstances, strategic considerations can trump
proliferation concerns in the eyes of the United States and its
partners.

[[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [has]{.mark} indeed [become a]{.mark}n
invaluable strategic [partner to many]{.mark} of the [countries]{.mark}
that would be [responsible for imposing costs]{.mark}---reputational or
otherwise---for Seoul going down the nuclear route.]{.underline} Since
the turn of the century, Seoul has forged a global network of
geopolitical and economic linkages that would mitigate and perhaps even
prevent any long-lasting reputational, diplomatic, or even economic
backlash were it to decide to develop nuclear weapons. These
include arms exports, among others, to NATO members, including the
United States, in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well
as to Southeast Asia and the Middle East; nuclear power plant
construction, particularly in the Middle East so far but potentially
also in Europe in the future; factories and supply chain links with the
United States, Europe, India, Japan, and Southeast Asia; and burgeoning
security ties with NATO, Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Poland,
and other partners---plus trilateral United States-South
Korea-Japan cooperation. [Because South Korea has become so important to
much of the global system, its [partners would be forced to
conduct]{.mark} a [difficult cost-benefit analysis]{.mark} [between
upholding]{.mark} the [nonprolif]{.mark}eration regime [or
continuing]{.mark} their [coop]{.mark}eration [with Seoul]{.mark}.
Whether implicitly or explicitly, [Seoul could use these]{.mark} links
[as a bargaining tool]{.mark}.]{.underline} This may be seen as
transactional, and it would be. But such is the nature of contemporary
international relations.

[[Even economic sanctions]{.mark}---one of the nonproliferation regime's
most powerful tools---[may not]{.mark} be a realistic
[deter]{.mark}rent. [In 2016, China
imposed]{.mark} ]{.underline}[unofficial sanctions[ on
So]{.underline}]{.mark}[uth [Ko]{.mark}rea after the Park Geun-hye
administration agreed to the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense missile defense system on Korean soil. [The
sanctions]{.mark} hit the South Korean economy, but they [did not wreak
havoc]{.mark} on it, even though China accounts for 25 percent of South
Korean exports.]{.underline} Eventually, Beijing removed the sanctions,
in no small part because Beijing also needs access to South Korea's
semiconductors and other high-tech products to compete in the global
economy.

#### NPT fails---militarization of non-prolif regimes

Tarja **Cronberg 25**, former Member of the European Parliament and a
Distinguished Associate Fellow at SIPRI (Tarja, 7-11-25, \"The
militarisation of non-proliferation: Will the NPT survive?\" European
Leadership Network

CT

In 2002, US President George W. Bush categorised three states -- Iraq,
North Korea, and Iran -- as the "Axis of Evil". All have been accused of
either developing or intending to develop nuclear weapons. In Iraq,
these accusations and claims resulted in a US military intervention,
which found no traces of a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program**[.
This military intervention created a reaction in North Korea as it
feared it would meet the same fate. [North Korea withdrew from the NPT
and tested for nuclear weapons]{.mark} in 2006. Now Iran is facing the
North Korean choice, the outcome of which is still open. Iran developed
a clandestine nuclear program before 2003. In 2003, the EU initiated the
first negotiations that led to Iran's voluntary suspension of uranium
enrichment.]{.underline}** In 2005, the US joined the talks, hoping
these would fail. This shifted the blame to Iran and made it possible to
take the matter to the Security Council and impose a series of UN
sanctions. **[Suspension of uranium enrichment has been the red thread
in negotiations, as Iran claims its right, according to the
NPT,]{.underline}** to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. When the US
opened up to the idea of small-scale enrichment by Iran, the JCPOA was
negotiated in cooperation with the EU and signed in 2015. Iran would
remain a non-nuclear state, apply strict verification requirements, and,
in return, receive some sanctions relief. **[As the IAEA gave its
blessing, [the agreement was recognised as a prime example of
non-proliferation restrictions under the NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
May 2018, US President Trump withdrew from the agreement. Iran followed
the JCPOA restrictions during a year of "strategic patience", hoping the
EU could repair the situation. Re-negotiation of the deal was expected
to occur during the Biden administration, but aside from a few contacts
and initiatives, there was no progress. In his new term, President Trump
restarted negotiations, premised on the idea that Iran could potentially
continue some enrichment while securing that Iran would not get nuclear
weapons. This position was later changed to no enrichment, which Iran
strongly opposed. The renewed discussions included innovative new ideas,
such as creating a consortium with neighbouring states, such as Saudi
Arabia and the UAE, that could ensure regionally that Iran was not
building nuclear weapons. On 13 June 2025, in the middle of these
US--Iran negotiations**[, Israel attacked Iran by bombing its nuclear
sites and killing selected military leaders and nuclear scientists. A
few days later, the US joined the war effort to guarantee the
destruction of facilities and machinery.]{.underline}** This was not the
first time Israel opted for military methods to prevent proliferation in
the Middle East. In 1981, Israel bombed Iraq´s nuclear research reactor
under construction at Osirak, southeast of Baghdad.  Even though Iraq´s
suppliers, France and Italy, maintained that the reactor was for
peaceful scientific purposes, Israel claimed it was designed for nuclear
weapons. The attack was widely condemned as the site had been approved
by the IAEA and was under its safeguards. In 2007, Israel, with the help
of US intelligence, bombed an assumed nuclear facility in the Deir Ezzor
region in Syria. **[[Syria was also a party to the NPT]{.mark} [and had
not]{.mark} yet [been obliged to declare the facility]{.mark}. [These
attacks illustrate what is often called the Begin
doctrine]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[which is]{.mark} [about preserving
Israel´s nuclear monopoly in relation to its
neighbours]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Prime Minister Begin explicitly
stated that preventive strikes are not an anomaly, **[but a precedent
for every future government in Israel, whether or not the countries are
members of the NPT]{.underline}** and the facilities are under
safeguards. **[[These military actions challenge the non-proliferation
regime and its cornerstone treaty, the NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They
are illegal both according to the UN Charter and international law.
While the line between a peaceful nuclear program and a military program
is difficult to draw, and assumed nuclear intentions are ambiguous at
best, there is no legitimacy for military action by an individual state.
Israel sees the potential of Iranian nuclear weapons as an existential
risk. It is true that Iran does not recognise Israel´s right to exist,
and Iranian leaders have called for Israel's destruction. The
international community should condemn this rhetoric. However, it does
not give the right to "pre-emptive" military intervention as the state's
survival was not at stake.As the recent US intelligence
statement established, Iran had not made the decision to develop nuclear
weapons beyond collecting enriched uranium. There was no immediate
nuclear threat, and pre-emptive military action is illegal.  Destroying
nuclear facilities and killing scientists not only undermines permanent
peaceful solutions to prevent proliferation in the Middle East but also
creates further proliferation risks. After the attacks, Iran passed a
bill that would enable it to halt cooperation with the IAEA and has
expelled IAEA investigators. **[[The Iranian parliament is
also preparing the documents to leave the NPT]{.mark}. Instead,
[NPT-supported negotiations on a regional zone free of nuclear
weapons]{.mark} could help reduce the nuclear threat against Israel.
[But Israel has sabotaged the process]{.mark} by refusing to participate
[in all the negotiations proposed by the NPT review
conferences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A MEWMDFZ could prevent military
intervention as state members would ratify a regional treaty with high
standards of verification, in some cases, both by the IAEA and
regionally. So far, there have been no cases where a member of a NWFZ
has cheated and developed a nuclear program. **[The next NPT Review
Conference in 2026 should concentrate on preventing nuclear
proliferation in the Middle East. It should draft a serious work program
for how to proceed with its commitment to MEWMDFZ before it is too
late. The impact of the military strikes will not only be felt in the
Middle East]{.underline}**; **[these strikes endanger the future of the
NPT. [The NPT review process has repeatedly underlined the need for the
four states outside the NPT to join the NPT as non-nuclear states, so
far without any result]{.mark}. The five NPT-accredited nuclear weapon
states have repeatedly defended the NPT as a treaty to prevent
proliferation]{.underline}**. **[[The militarisation of
non-proliferation pushes the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty into the
margins]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The arena is now free for any claims
that a state has intentions to access nuclear weapons and, consequently,
justifies military action against it, paving the way for regime change.
Expanding Nuclear Weapon-Free Zones could guard against this. The
European Leadership Network itself as an institution holds no formal
policy positions. The opinions articulated above represent the views of
the authors rather than the European Leadership Network or its members.
The ELN aims to encourage debates that will help develop Europe's

**[The ceasefire]{.underline}**, in the current Iran--Israel theatre,
**[is less a diplomatic achievement than a stage-managed
illusion]{.underline}**. Iran launched an attack on the US Al Udeid Air
Base in Qatar on Monday. It was followed by a unilateral ceasefire
announcement by the US and rejected in its current form by Iran. The
so-called truce reflects a familiar choreography: Washington claims
de-escalation before consent, while Tehran conditions a pause on
reciprocity. **[Beneath the optics lies the enduring logic of asymmetry
-- where Iran's doctrine of forward defence and Israel's doctrine of
pre-emption remain irreconcilable.]{.underline}** The silence of Gulf
Arab states underscores the regional unease: this is not peace but a
recalibration of risk and the US's significant role in this ceasefire
cannot be overlooked.

What we have at present is not a firm, mutually agreed ceasefire,
but rather a proposal endorsed by the US. Iran has not yet given its
formal consent, and the threat of hostilities -- rockets and missile
warnings -- continues to loom. The next 24 hours will be a tense test:
will Israel be the first to break the truce, will Iran reciprocate, or
can the ceasefire serve as a foundation for broader de-escalation?

Historically, such ceasefires rarely resolve the underlying antagonism;
they merely suspend it. Like the 1988 Iran--Iraq truce or the 2006
Israel--Hezbollah stalemate, today's manoeuvre may freeze kinetic
hostilities only to intensify shadow wars through cyber strikes,
assassinations, and proxy entrenchment. At best, this is a managed
confrontation. At worst, a prelude. In either case, the language of
peace is being used to buy time -- not to secure it. More likely, a
frozen conflict model emerges -- missiles stop, but cyber warfare,
assassinations, and proxy skirmishes persist. This would mirror the
US--Soviet Cold War detente era: deterrence without disarmament. The key
to this outcome is whether Israel can accept a strategic stalemate
without escalation and whether Iran sees the benefit in keeping its
powder dry. These potential consequences of the ceasefire are crucial to
consider in understanding the current situation.

**Dirty Work**

When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently praised Israel for doing
the "dirty work" of striking Iranian targets, his remarks were framed as
strategic realism. However, beneath that framing lies a deeper problem:
a Western discourse that views the erosion of legal norms as a tactical
necessity and the selective application of international law as
unremarkable. The celebration of military action -- whether Israeli or
American -- against Iran must be understood not as a discrete policy
episode but as a rupture in the architecture of global nuclear
governance.

**[[The US bombing of Iran's nuclear infrastructure]{.mark}, targeting
sites at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow, is not just a kinetic escalation.
It also [signifies a symbolic dismantling of the]{.mark} Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty [(NPT) as a credible international
regime]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The fact that **[[these facilities were
under]{.mark} International Atomic Energy Agency [(IAEA) oversight and
part of a system Iran has remained committed to for decades]{.mark}
seems to matter less to policymakers than it should.]{.underline}** What
was struck was not just enrichment capability -- it was the foundational
premise that legal compliance offers security. This action marks a
significant shift in the logic of proliferation.

Iran has remained a signatory to the NPT since 1970. Even after the 1979
revolution and the West's adversarial stance, it did not withdraw.
The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) subjected Iran to
one of the most stringent inspection regimes ever negotiated. The
collapse of that agreement -- triggered not by Iranian non-compliance
but by the unilateral US withdrawal in 2018 -- did not prompt immediate
Iranian escalation. Tehran remained within the bounds of the NPT. "Under
the 159-page deal, Iran 'significantly reduced its nuclear program and
accepted strict monitoring and verification safeguards to ensure its
program is solely for peaceful purposes," ABC News recently reported. On
terminating US participation in the JCPOA, on 8 May 2018, President
Trump reimposed economic sanctions on Iran. The Western allies of the US
protested his move but later settled with it and began discussions with
Iran about its crude oil reaching European countries given the
sanctions.

Later, the US assassination of General Qassem Soleimani in the pre-dawn
dark of 3 January 2020, near Baghdad International Airport, did more
than decapitate Iran's most formidable military strategist -- it
detonated a geopolitical tremor whose aftershocks are still unfolding.
In Tehran, and beyond, the killing collapsed factional divides as
hundreds of thousands mourned not merely a man, but a doctrine of
calibrated deterrence, regional entrenchment, and the projection of
Iranian sovereignty through asymmetric means. Iran's retaliatory missile
strikes on US bases in Iraq, though symbolically measured, signaled a
chilling proximity to full-scale war.

In this theatre, the strike marked an epochal shift: the normalization
of high-profile political assassination as a tool of statecraft,
rendering blurry the already fraying distinction between war and peace.
What was extinguished in that moment was not only a man but the tenuous
scaffolding of regional stability, replaced by a doctrine of impunity
masquerading as strategy. The killing marked a precedent-setting moment:
the first time a state actor had openly assassinated a high-ranking
official of another sovereign nation in peacetime. It blurred the lines
between war and targeted killing, expanding the scope of "legitimate"
pre-emptive action in global politics.

Israel launched its strike on Iran just days before a planned sixth
round of nuclear talks in Oman, exploiting Tehran's assumption that
negotiations with the US would forestall any attack. Netanyahu has long
framed the dismantling of Iran's nuclear program as a non-negotiable
priority for Israel's national security. Then again, simply pursuing his
own political survival was likely another reason to strike Iran.

**[[The US bombing]{.mark} of Iran's nuclear infrastructure [signals
a]{.mark} strategic [shift with far-reaching consequences]{.mark}. [The
NPT regime]{.mark}, [already weakened by decades of double
standards]{.mark}, now [risks terminal collapse.]{.mark} [A state
that]{.mark} broadly [cooperated with IAEA inspections]{.mark}, its
enrichment regime, [and accepted intrusive monitoring]{.mark} has [found
itself punished rather than protected]{.mark}. The implication is stark:
[the treaty does not provide security -- it exposes
vulnerability]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The narrative in the West is premised on the logic of a report the
IAEA issued on 31 May 2025. The report was highly contested by Iran and
Russia. For the first time in two decades, the IAEA formally rebuked
Iran on 12 June 2025, sharpening international scrutiny just as whispers
of a looming Israeli military strike grow louder. The censure vote on
the resolution submitted by the US, Britain, France and Germany, with 19
votes in favour, 11 abstentions, and 3 against -- Russia, China, and
Burkina Faso, drawing the line against a Western script they no longer
read from.

**Proliferation and its Logic**

The **[logic of proliferation is now inverted]{.underline}**. **[Where
once restraint signaled credibility, it now invites risk]{.underline}**.
It is a proliferation catalyst. Regional powers, such as Turkiye and
Saudi Arabia, which have long hedged their positions, now face a stark
choice. The logic of restraint has collapsed.  **[[Withdrawal from the
NPT -- once politically unthinkable -- now seems strategically
rational]{.mark}. [The bomb]{.mark}, once considered a threat, [has
become the only viable shield]{.mark}. [Non-nuclear status]{.mark}, once
a pillar of global consensus, now [reads as strategic
vulnerability]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

And for what? The tactical gains, if any, are illusory. No bomb can
erase knowledge. No missile can obliterate scientific memory. Technical
capacity, once acquired, is not so easily destroyed. Infrastructure can
be rebuilt; expertise is retained. If the objective was to delay Iran's
nuclear capability, the more probable result is to accelerate it -- this
time in total opacity. Iran's exit from the NPT now appears not just
plausible but imminent. Outside that framework, there will be no
inspections, oversight, or restraint. What was once visible to the
international community will go dark irrespective of the slated
objective of a regime change.

There is also the operational dimension. Over 40,000 US troops are
stationed across the region. They now face an expanded spectrum of
asymmetric retaliation. Iran's regional networks -- state and non-state
alike -- are calibrated to respond asymmetrically, from cyber operations
to targeted strikes via proxies. A **[single strike on nuclear
facilities may thus trigger a prolonged and diffuse regional
confrontation.]{.underline}**

The deeper issue, however, is not operational. It is structural. The
JCPOA was not a perfect agreement, but it achieved tangible
non-proliferation outcomes. It capped enrichment, reduced stockpiles,
and ensured transparency. Israeli and American intelligence services
acknowledged these results. The agreement's flaw was not technical but
political: it offered the possibility of Iran's reintegration. For some,
that was unacceptable. The sabotage of the deal -- through economic
strangulation, assassinations, and now overt bombing -- must be read as
a campaign not against weapons but against normalization.

For twelve consecutive days, Israel has waged an intense aerial campaign
against Iranian nuclear and military sites. On June 22, the United
States joined the offensive, striking three major nuclear facilities
Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordow. The military aggression, which Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims is meant to prevent an
"existential threat," has killed hundreds, injured thousands, and caused
significant damage to Iran's nuclear infrastructure. But beyond the
immediate physical devastation, this coordinated assault may have far
more consequential fallout: the collapse of Iran's commitment to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and with it, the unravelling of
the global non-proliferation regime.

**[[Iranian lawmakers have]{.mark} made no secret of their [growing
frustration]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The head **[of [Iran's Parliament
Foreign Policy Committee]{.mark}, Abbas Golroo, [invoked Article 10 of
the NPT, which allows a state to withdraw]{.mark} if "extraordinary
events have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country." [Iran's
Foreign Minister]{.mark} Abbas Araqchi also [echoed this
sentiment]{.mark}]{.underline}** and warned that all options were now on
the table to defend Iran's sovereignty and security. With both the U.S.
and Israel now openly attacking nuclear sites that were under
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, and without
evidence from the IAEA that Iran was developing a nuclear weapon,
**[Iran's threat to withdraw from the NPT is no longer a bluster. It is
an inflection point in nuclear diplomacy.]{.underline}**

Iran's nuclear program has long existed under the scrutiny of the IAEA
and the international community. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA), though abandoned by the Trump administration in 2018,
had curbed Iranian enrichment activities and placed rigorous monitoring
mechanisms on its nuclear infrastructure. According to the IAEA, "there
remains no definitive evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons."
Even so, Tehran has faced military aggression, first from Israel, and
now from the United States.

**[[Article 10 of the NPT stipulates that a]{.mark} member [state may
withdraw from the treaty if]{.mark} extraordinary events related to [the
treaty jeopardized its]{.mark} supreme [interests]{.mark}. From Iran's
perspective, [the coordinated military strikes]{.mark} by a
nuclear-armed, non-NPT state (Israel) and an NPT-signatory (the United
States) against its safeguarded facilities [met that threshold]{.mark}.
[These attacks are]{.mark} not mere warnings or acts of deterrence, they
are [strategic, pre-emptive attempts to obliterate Iran's nuclear and
missile infrastructure under the presumption of future weaponization,
not current violations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This distinction is critical. A preventive war is not sanctioned under
international law. Without evidence of imminent threat, these attacks
amount to a violation of Iran's sovereignty, and arguably of the legal
spirit underpinning the NPT itself. If Iran chooses to walk away from
the treaty, it would cite these attacks not only as justification but as
an existential imperative.

Iran would not be the first country to withdraw from the NPT. In 1993,
North Korea announced its intention to withdraw, only to suspend it
during last-minute negotiations with the U.S. That effort eventually
produced the Agreed Framework, although the deal later collapsed. In
2003, Pyongyang resumed its withdrawal and went on to develop nuclear
arsenal. The diplomatic failure to preserve North Korea's NPT membership
has since haunted global non-proliferation policy.

Iran's situation is eerily similar, but potentially more destabilizing.
**[Iran has significantly greater scientific infrastructure, larger
population, and more regional entanglements than North
Korea.]{.underline}** Unlike Pyongyang, Tehran had accepted IAEA
oversight until recently. Its threat to withdraw now carries with it not
only the prospect of nuclear proliferation, but the ripple effect of
further erosion of NPT norms. If a treaty member under full IAEA
monitoring can be bombed with impunity by a nuclear power, what
incentive do other non-nuclear states have to remain compliant?

The moral and political asymmetry of the current moment is difficult to
ignore. Iran is a signatory to the NPT and has, until recently,
cooperated with international inspections. Israel, meanwhile, is not
a member of the treaty and maintains a policy of nuclear ambiguity and
it is widely believed to possess a robust nuclear arsenal. By targeting
Iran's nuclear scientists, bombing enrichment facilities, and
assassinating top officials, Israel has consistently undermined not only
Iran's capacity but also the global norms that govern the peaceful use
of nuclear energy.

The United States' role is equally troubling. While the Trump
Administration insists that **[U.S. strikes]{.underline}** have
"substantially delayed" Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapon, their
actual impact **[may have ignited a new chapter of
confrontation]{.underline}**. Washington's decision to bomb an
NPT-member state's safeguarded facilities, especially after abandoning a
nuclear agreement that was still functioning, sends a dangerous message:
treaties are conditional on power, not principle.

**[If Iran withdraws from the NPT, the implications are
vast]{.underline}**. The country would no longer be legally bound to
refrain from nuclear weapon development. It could expel IAEA inspectors,
halt all safeguards, and bring its uranium enrichment to weapons-grade
levels. According to IAEA, Iran already possesses more than 400 kg of
60% enriched uranium, just a short technical leap from the 90% threshold
needed for a bomb. **[While Israel has assassinated several senior
Iranian scientists, [Iran retains the expertise and
infrastructure]{.mark} (deep underground nuclear facilities) [to restart
and accelerate weaponization if it chooses]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Iran, with current development, is more likely than ever to pursue a
bomb. The military strikes have removed the advantage of ambiguity Iran
once maintained and made open the pursuit of nuclear weapons a logical,
yet dangerous, strategic response. Far from neutralizing a threat of
nuclear Iran, the U.S and Israeli campaigns may have catalysed it.
**[[Beyond Iran, the NPT itself may not survive the
shock]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Other countries, especially those in
volatile regions, will be watching closely. If Iran is punished despite
compliance, they may conclude that nuclear armament is the only reliable
guarantee of sovereignty. The precedent could embolden nations like
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, or even Turkey to reconsider their nuclear posture.

Despite severity of the recent events, the announcement of a ceasefire
between Iran and Israel by President Trump on Monday evening offers a
fragile but vital diplomatic off-ramp. Iran has not yet officially
withdrawn from the NPT and its ambassadors have reiterated a desire for
peaceful resolution. But time is short and this window of opportunity is
limited. Any violation of the ceasefire will only harden Tehran's
stance, therefore, the ceasefire must be followed by immediate, good
faith diplomatic engagement. To salvage the situation, both the United
States and its allies must use this pause to engage in renewed
negotiations; that begins with halting further military provocations and
engaging Iran in meaningful dialogue, possibly under new international
mediation. Re-entry into the JCPOA framework or a revised agreement,
could offer mutual assurances, economic relief, and a return to
transparent monitoring. The alternative is a chain reaction of
withdrawal, rearmament, and war.

What began as a series of tactical airstrikes may end as the most
consequential blow to global nuclear order since the Cold War. Israel
and the United States have gambled that force can substitute for
diplomacy. If Iran now exits the NPT and restarts its weapons program in
earnest, the consequences will extend far beyond the Middle East.

#### Iran proliferation promotes Middle East regional stability

**Woodville '24** \[Peter; August 8; Intern for the Pennsylvania
Attorney General's Office, junior editor for the Columbia Political
Review; Columbia Political Review, "Chaos Within the Middle East? Why a
Powerful Iran Brings Stability to the Region"\]

[**[Iran]{.mark}** has [put]{.mark} the [**Middle East** in "a
**convergence of crisis**]{.mark}," United States Army General Michael
Kurilla told the Senate Armed Services Committee back in
March.]{.underline} The country has a soaring poverty rate, an economy
that has been crippled by economic sanctions, and an increase in
civilian discontent with its government. [Despite these woes, Iran
continues to [spend billions of dollars toward]{.mark} its [military
each year]{.mark}, including financing various militant groups such as
Hamas and Hezbollah.]{.underline} While Iran's strong military presence
in the Middle East is regarded as a hindrance toward regional peace by
U.S. government and military officials[, [their]{.mark} military
[presence promotes]{.mark} a [**balance of power** in the]{.mark}
[region]{.mark} by counteracting the United States' regional
presence.]{.underline} In the past 20 years, the United States has
fought extensive wars with two of Iran's neighbors, Iraq and
Afghanistan, and [[Iran is constantly under]{.mark} the [threat of
war]{.mark} or invasion.]{.underline}

[In addition to protecting itself from invasion, [Iran's
military]{.mark} and foreign policy [strengthens alliances]{.mark} with
Russia and China]{.underline}. In light of having a smaller budget and
military than the U.S., Iran centers its strategy around proxy conflicts
and irregular naval tactics, allowing it to fight the U.S. and Israel
without directly placing troops on the ground. Iranian naval tactics
rely on smaller, quicker vessels to encircle and overwhelm larger ships
despite having lesser military capabilities. This method was evinced by
a small group of Iranian motorboats following a U.S. Navy ship off the
coast of the Strait of Hormuz on August 17, 2023, forcing the ship to
evacuate. This was not an isolated incident as there has been an uptick
in Iran's seizure of vessels in the region recently, despite its smaller
military.

[Besides pushing back against the U.S., Iran's military presence [fends
off rival **Saudi Arabia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The rivalry between the
two countries is generated partly from an ancient religious divide
between the Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, which are dominant in Saudi
Arabia and Iran respectively. This religious divide still plays a major
role in each country's foreign policies, evinced by both countries'
support for various groups in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq[.]{.underline} In
addition to the Sunni versus Shia rivalry between the two countries,
[Saudi Arabia has maintained more friendly relations with Israel in
recent years when compared to Iran, as it has refused to engage in
direct combat.]{.underline} [[Saudi Arabia has also **bolstered** its
military heavily]{.mark}, as in 2019 alone it spent as much on defense
as Iran did over a four-year period. Saudi Arabia is a military ally of
the U.S., [making it more of a threat to Iran's **safety** and
**stability**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

While Iran still experiences devastating economic sanctions, [the
[growing threat of]{.mark} other [regional]{.mark} [powers in the
**Middle East**]{.mark} such as **Saudi Arabia**, **Israel**, and **the
U.S**. [makes]{.mark} it [**imperative** for Iran to]{.mark} focus on
[bolster]{.mark}ing its [defense]{.mark} as well as its domestic
economics.]{.underline} [This way [Iran]{.mark} will not only protect
itself better, but it [can]{.mark} also push back against superpowers,
[prevent]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} [Middle East]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
breaking into more [chaos or a **full-blown war**]{.mark}. Political
[scientists]{.mark} such as Kenneth Waltz [argue]{.mark} that
[Iran]{.mark}'s nuclear [proliferation]{.mark} would even [**stabilize**
the Middle East]{.mark} since it would [counterbalance]{.mark} the
tipped [scales]{.mark} that are currently [tilted against Iran]{.mark}
in the region, such as Israel having several nuclear bombs.]{.underline}
With a more powerful military, Iran is better able to counter Saudi
Arabia and Israel's military forces. [[Iran serv]{.mark}ing [as]{.mark}
a [**deterrence** to regional powers]{.mark}]{.underline} is
demonstrated by the fact that, despite increasing hostility in the
Middle East, [most recent attacks against Iran have been relatively
small, [preventing an all-out regional war]{.mark}.]{.underline}
