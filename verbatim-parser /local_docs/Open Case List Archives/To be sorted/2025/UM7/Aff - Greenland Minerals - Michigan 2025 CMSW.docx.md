This aff argues that the United States should expand its mining
operations in Greenland to secure its strategic mineral supply chain and
assuage concerns over Trump's imperialist foreign policy with respect to
Greenland. Advantage 1 is useful vs DAs, Advantage 2 is useful vs CPs.
The aff fiats both development and exploration, as the primary solvency
advocates (Hardy 24 and Maitra 25) both use the words "development" and
"exploration" to define the recommended course of action. The aff would
likely require negotiating with Greenland over rights to new mining
areas, although the second Maitra 25 card in the 1AC says that "the
United States already has basing and mining rights in Greenland, and
both Denmark and Greenland are interested in offering more." There's a
China advantage that can be paired with or read separately from
Advantage 2 -- basic idea is it baits the China DA link and says getting
China out of Greenland/Arctic is good.

[Rare earth elements [(REEs) are a critical **leverage point** for
China]{.mark} in the 2025 US-China trade negotiations,]{.underline}
serving as a powerful bargaining chip due to [China's dominance over the
global supply chain and the US's heavy reliance on these materials for
strategic industries]{.underline}. Below is an analysis of their
importance, grounded in available information and web sources,
summarized in five key points:

China's Supply Chain Dominance: [[China controls]{.mark} approximately
**60-[70%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} global REE [mining and]{.mark} over
[**90%** of processing]{.mark}, including [**99%** of heavy REEs]{.mark}
like dysprosium and terbium, [which are **vital for defense**]{.mark},
automotive, [and high-tech]{.mark} applications (e.g., F-35 jets, EV
motors, semiconductors).]{.underline} This [near-monopoly gives China
significant leverage to disrupt US supply chains by imposing export
restrictions]{.underline}, as seen in April 2025 when Beijing curbed
exports of seven REEs in retaliation for US tariffs.

Impact on US Industries and Defense: The [US relies on China for 70% of
its REE imports]{.underline}, with no immediate domestic or alternative
sources to fill the gap. [[Restrictions have]{.mark} already [caused
**disruptions**]{.mark}, such as factory shutdowns]{.underline} (e.g.,
Ford's Chicago plant) and [concerns over military
readiness]{.underline}, as REEs are essential for advanced weaponry and
electronics. This vulnerability makes [REEs a potent tool for China [to
**pressure**]{.mark} the [US in negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly to counter US restrictions on Chinese tech exports like AI
chips.

Strategic Use in Trade Talks: [[China has historically **weaponized**
REEs]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as halting exports to Japan in 2010 over
a territorial dispute, and views them as a national security asset
rather than just a trade issue. In 2025, Beijing's export licensing
system allows it to slow or halt shipments without formally violating
trade agreements, giving [China flexibility to escalate or de-escalate
based on negotiation progress]{.underline}. Analysts note that China
links REE access to concessions on US tech restrictions, enhancing its
bargaining power.

Limited US Alternatives: Despite US efforts to build domestic REE supply
chains (e.g., \$439 million in Department of Defense investments since
2020), projects like MP Materials and Lynas USA will not meet demand
until at least 2027, producing only a fraction of China's output.
[[**Alternatives** from allies like Australia or Brazil are
**limited**]{.mark}, and [recycling or reprocessing **cannot scale**
quickly]{.mark} enough, making China's control a **critical advantage**
in short-term negotiations.]{.underline}

Geopolitical Leverage and Long-Term Strategy: [China's REE restrictions
not only target economic outcomes but also [signal]{.mark} its [ability
to challenge US]{.mark} military and [tech]{.mark}nological
**[primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By maintaining export controls even
after the May 2025 Geneva tariff truce, China underscores its
unwillingness to fully relinquish this "trump card," as described by
Chinese scholars and state media, to secure favorable terms in broader
trade and geopolitical disputes[, [including]{.mark} tensions [over
**Taiwan**]{.mark} and technology.]{.underline}

Conclusion: REEs are a central and powerful trump card for China in the
2025 US-China trade negotiations, leveraging US dependence to extract
concessions on tariffs and tech restrictions. While the US is working to
reduce reliance, its current vulnerability ensures China's REE dominance
remains a decisive factor, shaping the pace and outcome of talks.

Geopolitical Implications

[U.S. dependence on China for **REE**]{.underline} and downstream rare
earth products [is]{.underline} especially **[strong]{.underline}**, as
very little REE mining and magnet production and none of the REE
processing is done in the U.S. To mitigate China's stranglehold on the
rare earth industry, [the U.S.]{.underline} industry and [policymakers
face the challenge of developing a **domestic** rare earth
ecosystem]{.underline} --- from extraction to midstream processing to
further downstream manufacturing. China currently is the only country in
the world with a fully integrated permanent magnet supply chain. In
total, Chinese production accounts for approximately 58% of rare earth
mining, 89% of rare earth separation, 90% of metallization and 92% of
NdFeB global markets.\[60\]

Figure 6 and Figure 7 detail U.S. imports of various products along rare
earth permanent magnet value chains, with slight variance due to the
differing data collection methodologies between the U.N. Comtrade and
the United States Geological Survey. It is important to note that these
figures do not take into account rare earth products integrated directly
into goods further downstream before they are imported into the U.S. For
example, these figures do not account for rare earth magnets
manufactured in China and integrated into Chinese-made smart phones that
are then exported to the U.S. Therefore, [[American **commercial
reliance**]{.mark} on Chinese rare earth products [is]{.mark} likely
**[significantly understated]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Besides China, the U.S. imports REE from Estonia, France and Japan, but
these flows are misleading. In fact, Estonia procures its rare earth
feedstocks from Russia, while France and Japan are simply processing
links with no domestic mine production of their own, using feedstocks of
mixed sources including China and Russia. Because [[**U.S. allies** in
**Europe**]{.mark} and Japan currently [only possess
**downstream**]{.mark} **manufacturing [capabilities]{.mark}** [with
no]{.mark} **mining [output]{.mark}**, potential supply disruptions from
China could **affect allied supplies** of downstream rare earth
products]{.underline}.

Currently the only domestic producer is MP Materials from its Mountain
Pass facility in California (at the edge of the Mohave Desert), which
primarily supplies light REE, though there is a planned expansion into
heavy REE processing as well as metal conversion, alloying, and magnet
manufacturing in their new facility in Fort Worth, Texas.\[61\] Mountain
Pass sends the 42,000 tonnes of REO contained in the concentrate it
produces to China for further processing due, in part, to the absence of
domestic customers. The company is actively upgrading processing assets
on-site as it moves to integrate further down the rare earths value
chain.\[62\] Additionally, Noveon (formerly known as the Urban Mining
Company), the only operational U.S.-based permanent magnet manufacturer,
produces a small amount of NdFeB permanent magnets.

Besides MP Materials, there are other American enterprises working to
develop the domestic rare earth industry. The Texas Mineral Resources
Corporation (TMRC) is actively working to develop a rare earth project
at Round Top in South Texas, which looks to extract light and heavy REE
to be processed on-site.\[63\] According to the company's site, the
project is still in extremely early stages, as TMRC is still "focused on
the exploration and development" of their deposit.\[64\] Developing
domestic separation and other processing capabilities on-site
simultaneously cuts down logistical costs and will chip away at China's
current dominance of entire global rare earth value chains.

While [the second coming of [the U.S.]{.mark} rare earth [industry is
still in its **early stages**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this burgeoning
activity is encouraging. Still, permitting challenges as well as scaling
up to sizeable domestic production and processing will take a good deal
of time. [For the necessary industrial rare earth cluster to develop,
**[nodes all along]{.mark}** rare earth [**supply chains** must
develop]{.mark} **simultaneously**]{.underline}, so they can be pieced
together once fully operational. The current high prices of rare earths
are conducive to developing the rare earth industry. However, in the
event of depressed prices, due either to typical price fluctuations or
to Chinese price manipulation, U.S. policymakers must look to other
means to encourage development.

Chinese officials are highly conscious of the geopolitical advantage
they derive from their REE dominance. The 2010 incident over REE
shipments to Japan was a wake-up call to import-dependent customers.
Almost a decade later in 2019, threats of restricted supply
returned.\[65\] Xi's visit to a REE magnet production facility in
Ganzhou in 2019 was widely regarded as a sign that restricting REE
supply is on the table.\[66\] A week later, the People's Daily posted an
article explicitly threatening that if "the U.S. side wants to use the
products made by China's exported rare earths to counter and suppress
China's development," [the U.S. should not "**underestimate** the
Chinese side's ability to safeguard its development rights and
**interests**]{.underline}."\[67\] The more recent MIIT draft controls
list proposed in January 2021 also suggests that international policy
responses significantly influence Chinese domestic policies toward rare
earths.\[68\] Officials in Beijing are particularly focused on how
quickly the U.S. would secure alternatives if REE were included on the
control list.

Therein lies a paradox: China's state-supported rare earth enterprises
remain at the behest of international market dynamics. Overburdening
policy changes and perceived supply insecurity would push buyers away
from Chinese suppliers. Any restrictive moves would likely spur
proactive value chain restructuring away from Chinese REE. Therefore,
Chinese officials would be unlikely to directly restrict trade for
political reasons and calls for such are primarily just sword rattling
to disguise domestic policies and production controls that bear a more
long-term effect on supply coming out of China.

[Considering the [recent flare-up]{.mark} in U.S.-China tensions [over
**Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}, occurring against the backdrop of
global turmoil caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [it is
[**important** to note]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [**current
dynamics** over rare earth]{.mark} trading [would **not** hold
in]{.mark} the [event of]{.mark} **China's [invasion]{.mark} of the
island**]{.underline}. Will Chinese rare earth enterprises' responses
resemble those of Russia's Gazprom in the first half of 2022, a game of
limbo to balance their own revenue with geopolitical bridge-burning? Or
will China act swiftly to cut off rare earth supplies to its adversaries
given their end-use applications for defense technologies that maintain
U.S. military technological superiority? How would these actions carry
across to other alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and member countries? [China's deep **economic integration** with the
West suggests]{.underline} that [any decisions to alter trade will carry
**heavy implications**]{.underline} for all involved. As a result, their
response will be highly dependent on the level of support, especially
militarily, that the U.S. and its allies give to Taiwan. In any case,
[[as Chinese officials]{.mark} continue to [consolidate]{.mark} the
major [rare earth SOEs, they gain **greater control** over]{.mark} the
[industry and **more leverage**]{.mark} in their]{.underline}
ever-evolving [power plays with the West]{.underline}.

The U.S. Policy Response

Key government initiatives in the U.S. are worth highlighting for their
focus on developing domestic rare earth capabilities. Only relatively
recently did U.S. policymakers start to pay attention to the
intersection between geopolitics and market dynamics in the REE industry
--- primarily starting during the Trump era. In July 2019, then
President Trump made a series of presidential determinations (PDs) under
Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) that domestic
production, separation and manufacturing of rare earths is "essential to
the national defense" of the United States.\[69\] These designations
freed up funding from the Department of Defense (DOD) to pursue
increased production. On February 24, 2021, President Biden signed
Executive Order 14017 on Securing America's Supply Chains, which
requires the secretary of defense to submit a report identifying risks
in critical minerals supply chains, including REE, and policy
recommendations to address these risks.\[70\]

Title III of the DPA, which is dedicated to ensuring the timely
availability of essential domestic industrial resources, can help
buttress domestic rare earth industrial development.\[71\] Funding from
the DPA is essential to sustaining capital flows to highly intensive
rare earth extraction and processing projects. In addition, support from
the DPA is seen as a signal of legitimacy for projects and companies,
from a security and business standpoint, which can spur supplemental
investment.

Pursuant to the PDs on rare earth permanent magnet supply chains, the
DPA Title III program has issued several awards. Under the PD covering
light rare earth separation, the DOD awarded Australia's Lynas Corp an
investment worth \$30 million in February 2021 to establish U.S.-based
processing capabilities for light REM.\[72\] The facility will be
located in Hondo, Texas, as part of partnership with San Antonio's Blue
Line Corporation. The DOD also awarded \$10 million to MP Materials to
upgrade their on-site rare earth separation assets and a \$35 million
contract to MP Materials Corp in February 2022 to design and build a
heavy REM processing facility in Mountain Pass. This falls under the PD
covering medium and heavy rare earth separation and processing, with the
end goal of producing permanent magnets domestically.\[73\]
Additionally, the DOD granted \$30 million to Noveon to expand NdFeB
magnet production, under the PD for NdFeB production. The DPA has not
yet made awards to address the remaining PDs on rare earth metal
reduction and alloy processing, or on samarium-cobalt rare earth
permanent magnet production.

While these steps are encouraging, [**many investments** are in
**extremely early stages**]{.underline}, and it will likely take several
years to deliver products to markets with an unspecified projected
demand. With these actions in mind, during the recently concluded
Section 232 investigation on the "Effect of Imports of NdFeB Permanent
Magnets on the National Security," the Department of Commerce found that
current capacity development may satisfy 51% of domestic direct NdFeB
demand, under current projections that are set to increase, due
primarily to alternative energy applications such as wind power and
battery electric powertrains, which make intensive use of permanent
magnets. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether REE production outside
of China can compete with their unparalleled low-cost structure.\[74\]
We note that the issue of cost to "reshore" or "friend-shore" critical
raw materials and components, as represented by the Lynas procurement,
represents an enormous uncertainty in outlooks, ultimately affecting the
affordability of many technologies and products deemed essential for
energy applications and defense systems well into the future.

The 117th Congress is also focusing on developing domestic rare earths.
The CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) and
Science Act of 2022 and the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in late July
and early August 2022, respectively, include provisions designed to
better commercialize American rare earths. Legislative highlights
include tax refunds on production costs, increased funding authority for
R&D grants and further increases to DPA funding.

[For the U.S. to secure a **sustainable rare earth supply
chain**]{.underline}, rare earth [processing and manufacturing
technologies must be **commercially viable**]{.underline}. Herein lies
the U.S. government's main role: mitigating China's non-market approach
that is causing U.S. and allied rare earth industries to hollow out in
favor of subsidized and incentivized operations in China. This requires
a meticulous approach, utilizing public funding as a jumping-off point
for a rebounding domestic rare earth industry rather than a long-term
funding scheme that more closely resembles the Chinese command-economic
approach. Funding opportunities like the recent DOE-directed grant for
rare earth processing from industrial by-products, which holds little
commercial potential, should not be regarded as viable industrial
strategies for the industry as a whole.\[75\] While it is worthwhile to
explore various avenues to secure a domestic rare earth value chain,
more funding should be directed toward advanced novel capabilities that
do not play into the Chinese industrial stronghold, given the latter's
dominance of legacy technologies.

In the quest to compete with Chinese rare earth producers' low-cost
structures, a slippery slope will likely emerge in cost-cutting efforts.
These same dynamics contributed to the Mountain Pass mine's closure in
2002 due to a tailings pipeline discharge of thorium under the
supervision of the previous owner, Molycorp Minerals, LLC.\[76\] Where
regulatory ambiguities and logistical loopholes exist to circumvent
higher-cost sustainable resource management, domestic miners must
consider the long-term consequences of these decisions, which can easily
ruin promising projects while endangering the surrounding communities
and environment in the process.

While long-term supply resilience is a goal, "industrial planners" must
proactively mitigate the risks of immediate rare earth product supply
disruptions from China. Manufacturers and designers may opt to use REE
substitutes, but substitutes do not perform nearly as well.\[77\]
Designers looking to shift away from China-dominated REE may face the
task of engineering their products without these materials as the more
viable alternative. Recycling offers possibilities, especially from
permanent magnets, but a long path lies ahead for this to become viable.
Recycling too often is overstated given the outlook for raw materials
requirements. Recyclers face the same delays and conundrums in achieving
regulatory reviews and permits to move forward as mining and other
industrial projects.

Rare earths occur with phosphates in the U.S., which could become a
potentially alluring option.\[78\] Phosphates are extracted for a
variety of uses and are of interest for developing a competing battery
chemistry (lithium-iron-phosphate or LFP\[79\]). However, phosphates and
REE-containing minerals in sands deposits also bear the radioactive
elements thorium and uranium. This presents a persistent dilemma since
existing U.S. regulations limit the extraction of these radioactive
elements and thereby discourage the pursuit of REE.\[80\] REE can be
harvested from other sources, such as agricultural wastes, and could be
captured from deepwater seabeds, affording an exploration frontier.
Overall, however, REE exist within an inadequate framework for nonfuel
minerals --- especially given how critical they are to both legacy and
alternative energy technologies, much less non-energy and defense uses.

The U.S. government, of course, has its own part to play. First,
strategic [planners must]{.underline} honestly [distinguish rare earth
**demand** for **defense** and]{.underline} other [strategic purposes
from non-strategic demand]{.underline}. While both strategic and
non-strategic demand must be balanced in order to stabilize supply,
[[delivery **delays**]{.mark} for defense purposes [carry **significant
implications for combat readiness**, especially in an era of heightened
**major-power tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is also crucial that
the U.S. government ensure its strategic stockpiles of REE are filled to
aid in these efforts.

Conclusion

The recent merger that created the China Rare Earth Group is a major
development for the global rare earth industry. It is the most recent
chapter in the Chinese government's efforts to quell an industry that
has been unruly at times. Given that Chinese efforts to directly control
exports have been blocked by bodies like the WTO, officials are now
opting for domestically oriented policies to manage the industry. The
merger of China's largest rare earths operators is the most recent
iteration of decades of forced industrial consolidation meant to cut
down on inefficiencies and increase central oversight. These internally
facing policies, which carry significant consequences for global REE
industries, are more difficult to challenge in international dispute
systems than their externally-facing precursors.

Through the reorganization, Chinese regulators can better enforce
central policies and mitigate friction with local officials who often
encourage and permit rare earth production counter to central
regulations. From China's perspective, consolidation is a means to
produce rare earths in a more sustainable fashion by deploying more
uniform production and environmental practices, as well as reducing
speculative capital flows that increase domestic rare earth prices in
China. Greater oversight from the SASAC over the China Rare Earth Group
creates more leverage for Beijing's officials to influence prices by
further bifurcating the domestic and international prices of rare earth
products and stabilizing the former. It is also likely that demand will
increase, propelled by China's goals to increase alternative energy and
defense capacity. Thus, we anticipate this merger will not be the last
and that China's leaders will eventually fold the remaining three
northern rare earth SOEs into their own mega-conglomerate, absent any
significant deviations in industrial ideology.

Two [[geopolitical dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} properly
[[contextualize]{.mark} the [**risks** associated with China's **REE
dominance**]{.mark}: 1) Chinese tensions with the **U.S. and its
allies** over **trade** and 2) **Chinese positioning on
Taiwan**]{.underline}.\[81\] [Given China's **REE dominance** as a
stable global supplier, would Chinese officials]{.underline}
self-sabotage during periods of relative peace, [push]{.underline}ing
[Western countries to develop **alternatives**]{.underline} proactively?
Indeed, [despite **aggressive posturing**]{.underline} and threats from
Chinese officials and tabloids, [[China has **yet** to restrict]{.mark}
REE [exports as **leverage**]{.mark}]{.underline} in its trade war with
the United States. [[Aggression toward **Taiwan** would]{.mark} likely
[be a **completely different story**]{.mark}, especially if the U.S.
provides military]{.underline} equipment or combat [support to
Taiwan]{.underline}. With more centralized state oversight and a
leadership structure more amenable to central coordination, the China
Rare Earth Group increases the state's ability to influence and possibly
even restrict rare earth exports for political reasons.

Whether China would weaponize their leverage over rare earth supply
chains [[in **direct conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark} with the U.S.
and/or its allies is a matter of speculation and debate. However, one
thing is for sure: In such an event, [the [U.S. must minimize China's
ability to **limit sanctions** and]{.mark} other]{.underline} collective
[[**global responses** against]{.mark} **potential coercive
[action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Taking the invasion of Ukraine as an
example, Russia's VSMPO-Avisma's strong positioning as the leading
global aerospace-grade titanium supplier caused several EU member states
to oppose sanctions on the company, despite its role in maintaining
Moscow's force posture.\[82\] In order [[to **respond adequately** to
Chinese **military belligerence**]{.mark}, the [U.S. must
ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[China's]{.mark} consolidated rare
earth [industry does not grant Beijing **undue influence** over]{.mark}
an international [response]{.mark}. The U.S. and its allies must **act
accordingly** to divorce their strategic industries from **Chinese rare
earths**]{.underline}.

As a result of these dynamics, [U.S. government officials]{.underline}
are under pressure to take significant steps. They [must
mitigate]{.underline} short- and medium-term [**supply risks**
from]{.underline} potential [disruptions in Chinese supply
and]{.underline} simultaneously take a long-term approach to
[develop]{.underline}ing [a domestic rare earths ecosystem]{.underline}.
The former relies more on filling strategic stockpiles, securing
alternative supplies from allied countries like Australia and decreasing
product reliance on rare earths from an engineering standpoint where
possible. The latter involves a more holistic approach of bolstering
several nodes along rare earths value chains simultaneously (so they can
be connected once fully operational) and involving foreign capital in
these efforts when the opportunities present. Private-sector and
government funding from allies like Australia, Japan and South Korea can
be used to develop "friendly" rare earth supply chains with more secure
supply. However, the United States' sole reliance on allies to correct
domestic industrial deficiencies in rare earths would not provide the
more robust REE supply chains that are envisioned.

#### Invasion is [likely]{.underline}, and [catastrophic]{.underline} for humanity.

**The Week 25** -- The Week UK, a news magazine, 6/17/2025, \"Is China
preparing to invade Taiwan?\"
https://theweek.com/news/world-news/asia-pacific/954343/what-would-happen-china-attempt-invade-taiwan

[[China\'s attempt to conquer Taiwan]{.mark} by force [\"**could be
imminent**\"]{.mark}]{.underline}, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth
has warned.

\"There\'s no reason to sugarcoat it: the threat China poses is real,\"
he said, speaking at the 2025 Shangri-la Dialogue defence summit in
Singapore. [Beijing is]{.underline} \"credibly [preparing
to]{.underline} potentially [use military force to alter]{.underline}
the [balance of power]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific\". And, \"to be
clear: [[any attempt]{.mark} by]{.underline} Communist [China to conquer
Taiwan]{.underline} by force [[would result in **devastating
consequences**]{.mark} for]{.underline} the Indo-Pacific and [the
world]{.underline}.\"

[[Beijing views Taiwan as]{.mark} a **[rogue breakaway
territory]{.mark} to be brought back under control**]{.underline}, by
force if necessary, [making it]{.underline} arguably [\"the most
dangerous place on Earth\"]{.underline}, said The Economist.

How likely is an invasion?

Experts \"disagree about the likelihood and timing of a Chinese
invasion\", said the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

[China has been engaging in \"unprecedented aggression and military
modernisation\"]{.underline}, Admiral Samuel Paparo, [the commander of
US Indo-Pacific Command]{.underline}, told the US Congressional Armed
Services Committee in April. [Underscoring]{.underline} the [seriousness
of this **escalation**, he said [China\'s drills around Taiwan are
\"]{.mark}**not just exercises -- they are
[rehearsals]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}.

While \"alarming\", said the Atlantic Council, [this]{.underline}
\"unfortunately [reflects a broader, consistent trend\" of escalating
activities by]{.underline} the People\'s Liberation Army
[(PLA)]{.underline}, including persistent crossings of the Taiwan
Strait\'s median line.

[Data from Taiwan\'s Ministry of National Defence found]{.underline}
that [[sorties across]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Taiwanese-declared
[dividing line]{.mark} between Taiwan and China]{.underline} have
[[increased from 953]{.mark} incidents in 2021 [to **3,070**]{.mark}
**in 2024**]{.underline}.

There are other indications Beijing is preparing to move on Taiwan.
[[China has been stockpiling]{.underline}]{.mark} record amounts of
**[[gold]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which could be part of a strategy [to
defend itself from **Western sanctions**]{.underline} in the event of an
attack on Taiwan. [It has]{.underline} also [been
[building]{.mark}]{.underline} a solid [**[legal ground]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} a potential [invasion]{.underline}, aiming to frame the
attack as a legitimate internal matter.

\"This [[will help]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[country]{.mark} to
**[delay]{.mark} a [collective security]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
economic **[[response]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the West,\" said The
Sun.

When could an invasion happen?

Paparo told members of Congress that the [[PLA are
\"stretching]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[legs\" to
meet]{.underline}]{.mark} President [Xi Jinping\'s]{.underline} military
readiness [[goal of being **capable** of taking
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} by force [[by **2027**]{.mark}. That year is
seen as \"magical\" because it marks the centenary of]{.underline} what
was to become [the People\'s Liberation Army]{.underline}, said Robert
Fox in London\'s The Standard.

\"Others believe 2049 is a critical date,\" said the CFR, as Xi
Jinping has \"emphasised that unification with Taiwan is essential to
achieving what he calls the Chinese Dream, which sees China\'s
great-power status restored by 2049\".

How could an invasion start?

Chinese military drills last year surrounded Taiwan\'s main island with
joint exercises by all branches of the PLA and \"for the first time, the
increasingly militarised Coast Guard\", said The Guardian.

In January, Naval News first reported the construction of new amphibious
barges at Guangzhou Shipyard, in southern China.

These [[new barge]{.underline}]{.mark}-like Shuiqiao [[ships
are]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[a game-changer]{.mark} for
Beijing and provide \"insight into China\'s]{.underline} integration of
its military, paramilitary and civilian operations -- and its [plans
for]{.underline} a potential [invasion]{.underline}\", said The
Guardian.

The [barges feature bridges that [could]{.mark}]{.underline} be used to
[[transport tanks and supplies over previously uncrossable
land]{.underline}]{.mark}, said The Telegraph, [giving]{.underline} them
[multiple fronts for an invasion]{.underline} and \"thinning out\"
Taiwan\'s line of defence.

The [likely strategy is to overwhelm Taiwan]{.underline} with a massive
attack [with **little warning**]{.underline}.

That would mean in the early hours of a Chinese invasion, the narrow
strait separating the island from the mainland would likely be
\"transformed into a ferocious battlefield\", said Business Insider.
Aside from deploying more traditional weapons such as missiles or
warships, \"vast fleets of unmanned aerial and naval drones will likely
darken the skies and hide beneath waves, bringing with them a deadly
threat that Taiwan and its allies are ill-prepared to counter\".
During Joe Biden\'s presidency, the US strategy to counter this --
dubbed \"Hellscape\" -- hinged on deploying thousands of new drones that
would swarm the Taiwan Strait and keep China\'s military busy until more
help could arrive.

How would it play out?

[Chinese [action against Taiwan would]{.mark} be an \"act of war that
**[spark]{.mark}**s **[a global crisis]{.mark}**\"]{.underline},
said The Wall Street Journal. \"[It would provoke]{.underline} a
military [response by Taiwan, force]{.underline} President [Trump to
decide whether]{.underline} the US [military should help]{.underline}
defend the island, [disrupt **global trade** and impel **European
nations** to impose]{.underline} punishing [sanctions]{.underline} on
Beijing.\"

If a conflict were to break out [[it would be \"a
**catastrophe**\"]{.underline}]{.mark}, said the Economist. This is
first because of \"the bloodshed in Taiwan\", but also because of [the
[risk of \"**escalation between**]{.mark} **two [nuclear
powers]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}, namely the US and China.

Beijing massively outguns Taiwan, with estimates from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute showing that China spent about 23
times more on its military in 2021. The PLA also boasts more than two
million active soldiers. [[The US is **bound**]{.underline}]{.mark} by
the Taiwan Relations Act [to \"provide Taiwan with arms]{.underline} of
a defensive character\" and discourage China from using force or
coercion to achieve its goals regarding the island. [This [could see
Washington **drawn into**]{.mark}]{.underline} any
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} -- although there is growing scepticism
in Taipei that Trump would intervene militarily in the event of a
full-blown Chinese attack.

That means [any invasion \"would]{.underline} be one of the most
dangerous and consequential events of the 21st century\", said The
Times, and \"would [make]{.underline} the [Russian attack
on Ukraine look like a **sideshow**]{.underline} by comparison\".

#### Secure REE supply chains are critical to [US airpower]{.underline}.

Helene **Cooper 25**, Pentagon correspondent for the New York Times,
4/14/2025, \"China's Halt of Critical Minerals Poses Risk for U.S.
Military Programs,\"
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/politics/china-critical-minerals-risk-military-programs.html

[[On]{.mark} Air Force [fighter jets, magnets made of rare earth
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [mined or processed [in China are
**needed**]{.mark}]{.underline} to start the engines and provide
emergency power.

On precision-guided ballistic missiles favored by the Army, magnets
containing Chinese rare earth materials rotate the tail fins that allow
missiles to home in on small or moving targets. And on new electric and
battery-powered drones being adapted by Marines, rare earth magnets are
irreplaceable in the compact electric motors.

[[China's decision to retaliate against]{.underline}]{.mark} President
[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} sharp increase in [[**tariffs** by
ordering **restrictions**]{.mark} on]{.underline} the [exports
of]{.underline} a wide range of [critical minerals]{.underline} and
magnets [[is a **warning shot** across]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[bow of
**American national security**]{.underline}]{.mark}, industry and
defense [experts said]{.underline}.

In announcing that it will now require special export licenses for six
heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as
rare earth magnets, 90 percent of which are produced in China,
[[Beijing]{.mark} has [reminded]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Pentagon]{.underline}]{.mark} --- if, indeed, it needed reminding ---
that [a [**wide swath** of American weaponry is **dependent on
China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[This]{.underline} decision [is **hugely consequential for our national
security**]{.underline}," said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the
Critical Minerals Security Program with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

[[Beijing]{.mark}, by beginning with what one Air Force official called
a "heads-up" shot meant to signal how much more harm it could inflict
should it choose, has [left]{.mark}]{.underline} itself **[[plenty of
room to escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Beijing
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[move]{.underline}]{.mark} on from
the licensing restrictions [[to]{.mark} impose tariffs, quotas or even
an **[all-out ban]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Rare earths are a group of 17 elements, including neodymium, yttrium,
scandium and dysprosium, that are difficult to separate into usable
forms. [They are not actually rare]{.underline} at all [but can be
difficult to extract]{.underline} from the earth, and the process of
mining and refining them into usable form carries substantial
environmental costs.

They are present in almost every form of American defense technology.
[[They]{.mark} can [form very powerful magnets, for]{.mark} use in
**[fighter jets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, warships, missiles, tanks and
lasers. [Yttrium is required for high-temperature jet engine coatings;
it allows thermal barrier coatings on turbine blades to stop aircraft
engines from melting midflight]{.underline}.

According to the Defense Department, [**[every F-35]{.mark} fighter**
[contains]{.mark}]{.underline} around [[**900 pounds** of rare earth
materials]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some submarines need more than 9,200
pounds of the materials.

Across the American defense industry, [aerospace and weapons companies
have small stockpiles]{.underline} of the rare earths --- the industry
term for the 17 elements. That is [enough]{.underline}, defense industry
analysts say, [to meet]{.underline} their [needs for months rather than
years]{.underline}.

[The [Pentagon]{.mark}]{.underline} also [has [stockpiles]{.mark} of
**some**]{.underline} rare earths, [but those]{.underline} reserves
[[are **not enough**]{.mark} **to sustain defense
companies**]{.underline} indefinitely, one official said.

"[China]{.underline} mines and refines most of the world's rare earths,
and [dominates]{.underline} the [downstream supply chain]{.underline},"
said Aaron Jerome, a trader at Lipmann Walton and Co., a metals trading
company based in Britain. That supply-chain dominance allows Beijing
some say over just how much weaponry that is dependent on the rare
earths will cost, giving it enormous power over America's defense
industrial base.

Mr. Jerome pointed to what he called ["the F-35 magnet
debacle."]{.underline} Back [in 2022, the Pentagon]{.underline}
temporarily [stopped deliveries of Lockheed Martin's F-35
after]{.underline} the [manufacturer acknowledged]{.underline} that [an
alloy made in China was in a component]{.underline} of the stealth
fighter jet, violating federal defense acquisition rules.

At the time, the Pentagon said a magnet containing the alloy used in
part of the integrated power package posed no security problem.

But just [one month later, the Pentagon **allowed the deliveries to
continue** while it looked for another source]{.underline} for the
magnets. Wherever the magnets are coming from now, some component of it
is controlled by Beijing's lock on the supply chain, Mr. Jerome said.

With [[Beijing]{.mark} now [requiring]{.mark}]{.underline} that [its
[exporters]{.mark} of rare earths]{.underline} first [[receive]{.mark}
**express [permission from]{.mark} the [government]{.mark}** before
sending]{.underline} the [material]{.underline} to the United States,
[[American]{.underline}]{.mark} defense [[companies may see prices
**shoot up soon**]{.underline}]{.mark}, industry experts said.

As recently as the 1980s, the United States was a leader in rare earth
production, through the Mountain Pass mine in California. But by 2002,
Mountain Pass had shut down, with China dominating the market. [Mountain
Pass]{.underline} is now owned by MP Materials and is operating again,
but it [does not come close to Chinese production]{.underline}, industry
experts said.

The Aerospace Industries Association, representing defense contractors,
two years ago called again for the United States to shore up its
minerals supply chain to better secure access for the industry.

"[[U.S. **global leadership in aerospace**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
defense [[hinges on]{.mark} a [secure]{.mark} and resilient [supply
chain]{.mark} --- particularly [for]{.mark} the [**critical minerals**
used in]{.mark} the [production of **cutting-edge aircraft**]{.mark}
**technology**]{.underline}," Eric Fanning, the organization's
president, said at the time.

[China has flexed its muscle]{.underline} over the rare earth supply
chain [in the past. In 2010, Beijing halted rare earths]{.underline}
trade [with Japan]{.underline} following Japan's detention of a Chinese
fishing trawler captain. The Chinese move caught the attention of the
United States, alerting it to the threat posed by China's control over
the minerals' supply chain.

In 2017, during his first term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order
aimed at boosting U.S. domestic production, and President Joseph R.
Biden Jr. followed suit during his administration, allocating even more
money for rare earth extraction and refinement facilities.

The Pentagon has been adding to its stockpile since the 2010 episode
involving Japan, and "we have more of a stockpile than we did 15 years
ago," said Dan Blumenthal, senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute. But, he added, "that will not last long enough." [American
defense companies]{.underline}, he said, ["should be very
worried."]{.underline}

There is historical precedent for the United States' finding
alternatives to crucial elements and minerals during wartime. [[In World
War II]{.mark}, German U-boats sank]{.underline} many
[Allied]{.underline} cargo [ships carrying bauxite]{.underline} from
Suriname. ["[We would]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[have
**lost**]{.mark} **the war** [if we did not get **alternative
sources**]{.mark} for bauxite]{.underline}," said Seth G. Jones, author
of the upcoming book "The American Edge: The Military Tech Nexus and the
Sources of Great Power Dominance."

#### Air superiority solves [global conflict]{.underline}.

deterrence,"

//jwh

**[U.S. [adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}** are [[**threatening** to
set]{.mark} the **[world on fire]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and Washington
and its allies [[need to **restore deterrence**]{.mark} before it is
**too late**]{.underline}. In anticipation of a war in the Pacific,
[China is hoarding **fuel**, **food**, **raw materials**]{.underline}
and other strategic inputs, [restoring]{.underline} strategic
[**stockpiles** to levels **unprecedented**]{.underline} since Mao
Zedong. [[Russia's **war** against **Ukraine** shows]{.mark} the
**Kremlin's** [**willingness** to **threaten**
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [Moscow's **rhetoric**]{.underline}
levied [against NATO [**stokes fears** of]{.mark}]{.underline} wider,
potentially **[[nuclear conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Future wars may
[[involve]{.mark} **NATO allies**, as well as [U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}
naval and [**[air power]{.mark}** in the Pacific]{.underline}, and are
likely to be even higher intensity than the slog in Ukraine.

In the Red Sea, Iranian-backed Houthis have disrupted international
shipping, challenging the U.S. Navy and driving costs of international
commerce and global inflation up. Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy, is
launching missiles which murdered children in Northern Israel on July
28.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[building up
**air**]{.underline}]{.mark} and naval [[power]{.mark} to threaten
**Taiwan**, the **Philippines**, and]{.underline} other neighbors in
**[Southeast Asia]{.underline}**. The West has been slow to respond,
with U.S. domestic debt service and social allocations constraining the
military budget. **[[European countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** still
[**[depend on the U.S.]{.mark}** to provide military power]{.underline},
as their forces are understaffed, their weapons systems over-redundant,
and procurement --- discombobulated.

In the Russia-Ukraine War, FAB-3000 3.4 ton precision-guided bombs, and
drones and missiles launched from the distance against civilian energy
infrastructure with the intent to make the country unlivable in this
coming winter represent a key part of Russian strategy. Rebuilding the
infrastructure destroyed by these strikes is costly and futile since
restored power stations can be hit again. [[To **defend** against these
**attacks**, any **targeted** country would **require**]{.mark}
**anti-air missiles**]{.underline}. Even more so, it would [require
**[air superiority]{.mark}** platforms to **shoot down** Russian
**planes**]{.underline} launching the bombs and missiles.

Should Russia, or China, be inclined to recycle these tactics in future
conflicts, the costs will stretch Western resources thin. [The [**United
States** needs to **boost**]{.mark}]{.underline} its own [technological
**capabilities** by **funding**]{.underline} next-generation programs
like the Next Generation **[[Air Dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}** (NGAD)
platform [[to **restore deterrence**]{.mark} and **prevent** similar
**attacks**]{.underline}. The U.S. and its allies also [need to
**develop** and **deploy** a **host** of **cheap**, **mass-produced**
drones]{.underline} and anti-drone systems [and
**countermeasures**]{.underline}.

Specifically, [[to **offset**]{.underline}]{.mark} our
[[**adversaries**' swift **advances** in **air
superiority**]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the Chinese sixth
generation air dominance program, [the U.S. needs to **adopt** the most
**up-to-date** capabilities]{.underline} to combat such threats. The
Chinese sixth generation platform is anticipated to have similar
capabilities to NGAD, including a "loyal wingman" function, wherein an
individual aircraft will be assisted by unmanned craft to perform a
variety of functions tailored toward each mission. This function is
especially critical to compete with "kamikaze" drone warfare that forces
manned aircraft to engage with explosive unmanned craft.

[To **ensure** **air** combat **dominance**]{.underline} and superior
electronic warfare, and to enhance its long-range ground-attack power,
[the **U.S. Air Force** needs the **NGAD platform**]{.underline}, which
represents [the **sixth generation** of American fighter
jets]{.underline} and surrounding ecosystem. By adopting the NGAD
program, the United States can [**remain dominant** against its
**adversaries**]{.underline}.

Though proceeding with such a program may be a sound decision, it is far
from guaranteed. While Congress appears to have funded NGAD, the U.S.
Air Force may be considering cuts or delays in the program in favor of
updating the military's current F-35s. However, updating F-35s would do
little to ameliorate issues like the F-35 fleet's full mission capable
rate standing at a lackluster 30%. Meanwhile, refusing to commit to NGAD
would provide years of leeway for adversaries to continue developing
their air superiority capabilities.

The U.S. and its allies have been slowly losing their deterrence in the
international system. This dynamic is already showing its ill effects
across the global security landscape and the world's economy. It is
inviting aggression against the U.S. and against allies in Europe, the
Middle East, and eventually, in Asia. Aggressors have developed
capabilities to utilize airpower featuring gliding bombs in Ukraine,
high-impact, low-cost drones in the Red Sea, and missiles in the Levant.
Yet, these will be a sideshow in comparison with enemy six generation
fighters if the U.S. lacks one.

[If the United States **forgoes**]{.underline} the [**development** of
**NGAD**[, adversaries]{.mark} will **develop** **devastating** [**sixth
generation** fighters]{.mark}]{.underline} with accompanying drone
systems, [**[denying]{.mark}** the [U.S. **air superiority**]{.mark} for
the **first time** since **World War II**[. America needs to **restore
deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} and to develop the cutting-edge
technologies [[that help it **win wars** and **keep peace**]{.mark} for
over a **century**]{.underline}.

#### Independently, lack of stable REE sources collapse [clean energy supply chains]{.underline}, making climate change inevitable.

Gareth **Chetwynd 23**, Senior Correspondent for Recharge News,
7/6/2023, \"No way out: Critical minerals supply crunch is going to hurt
green transition, warns McKinsey,\"
https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/no-way-out-critical-minerals-supply-crunch-is-going-to-hurt-green-transition-warns-mckinsey/2-1-1482368?zephr_sso_ott=pVEKxn

The [[world is heading for]{.mark} a **[turbulent period of energy
transition]{.mark}** where [constraints on]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[supply of [critical materials are]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly
[[likely to slow]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[pace of
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to an influential new study.

US consultancy giant McKinsey & Co forecast shortages of critical
minerals in both high and low-paced energy transition scenarios and
found that [[access]{.mark} to materials [will slow]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[delivery of]{.mark} wind [turbines and solar panels]{.mark} while
also [restraining]{.mark}]{.underline} output of
**[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**lectric
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In the case of dysprosium, a rare-earth element (REE) used in many
electric motors, there is a risk of supply falling as much as 70%,
McKinsey said in a report published today (Thursday).

Among the higher volume minerals, nickel --- used in lithium-ion
batteries --- is expected to fall between 10% and 20% behind demand by
2030, McKinsey found.

The report suggested that the approximately 500 cobalt, copper, lithium
and nickel mines operating today will need to increase by between 40%
and 80% to meet demand for batteries, depending on the McKinsey demand
scenario applied.

A brake on decarbonisation

[[Without **decisive mitigation**]{.underline}]{.mark} actions, such
[[shortages]{.mark} could [raise]{.mark} supply-chain [costs for
**lower-carbon products**, slowing]{.mark}]{.underline} the affordable
[[transition]{.mark} to lower carbon alternatives and causing **price
volatility**]{.underline} across materials, the report suggests.

[This [could]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [[increase
**g**]{.mark}reen**[h]{.mark}**ouse **[g]{.mark}**a**[s]{.mark}**
emissions [by]{.mark}]{.underline} between 400 million and [[600 million
tonnes]{.mark} during]{.underline} the [remainder of the
decade]{.underline}, it warned.

Shortages of dysprosium and terbium, magnet materials used in electric
vehicles and wind turbines, were identified as as primary causes of this
increase beyond earlier projections which, McKinsey said, \"shows that
[[bottlenecks]{.underline}]{.mark} in just one or a few materials [can
**delay**]{.underline} the [deployment of lower-carbon
technologies]{.underline} across multiple industries.. [and]{.underline}
thus **[[slow]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[transition to
**net-zero**]{.underline}]{.mark} emissions\".

The assessment showed that most materials within the scope of the report
will face a shortage by 2030, across all scenarios.

\"Most [battery materials]{.underline}, especially lithium and cobalt,
[will continue to be **constrained**]{.underline} despite ongoing shifts
in battery chemistry, including the reduction in cobalt intensity and
the partial shift from nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) toward lithium-
iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries," McKinsey stated.

[Among]{.underline} the list of [elements likely to fall short of supply
were [**copper**, crucial to]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[speedy
build-out of transmission]{.underline}]{.mark}** and distribution lines
needed to connect renewable power sources to grids [and]{.underline}
thus [[a **major risk**]{.underline}]{.mark} factor [[for renewable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} investment, as well as iridium, a rare
element used in many hydrogen electrolysers and tin, used as solder in
semiconductors.

Trillions needed

McKinsey estimates that between \$3tn and \$4tn of investments in
mining, smelting and refining are needed to meet the shortfall in
supply, with annual spending demands for \$300-\$400m some 50% higher
than last decade.

The report noted that [there is little problem of **scarcity** among
critical minerals, and found]{.underline} that [resource
bases]{.underline} and reserves [are at]{.underline} their [highest
levels]{.underline} since 2000, [but argued]{.underline} that [building
up capacity will be no easy matter]{.underline}.

Challenges identified included timely delivery of permits, availability
of skilled labor, closing of project financing, timely delivery of
equipment, adequate infrastructure investments, availability of fresh
water for processing brine-based lithium, other and a stable regulatory
framework.

"Because it typically takes five to 15 years---depending on the
material, project characteristics, and regulatory environment---to
develop new deposits from exploration to mining operations, temporary
materials shortages could occur if demand growth outpaces initial
industry expectations," the report stated.

Supply chain constraints were also detected among inputs required in the
processing of critical minerals, such as sulfur, which is used in
refining nikel, lithium, manganese, and copper, but is already 5% short
of meeting demand with supply, the report said.

Ironically, one of the reasons for this shortfall is the
desulphurisation of oil and natural gas, McKinsey suggested.

Regionalisation not globalisation

Geopolitical tensions were very much on evidence this week when China
retaliated against US-led restrictions on sales of semiconductor
technology by restricting its own exports of gallium and germanium,
metals used primarily in chipmaking and communications, but also
relevant to the energy and automotive sectors.

McKinsey said [[there will continue to be]{.mark} a [high
concentration]{.mark} of mineral and metals supplies [in a **handful of
countries**]{.mark}, including China]{.underline} (rare-earth elements),
the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), and Indonesia (nickel) [and
warned]{.underline} that a [[growing **regionalisation** of
access]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately
[[hinder]{.underline}]{.mark} the [\"materials transition\" that is a
**fundamental part** of]{.underline} the [transition to a **[net zero
emissions global economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\"[The [industry]{.mark} will [need to ensure **security of
supply**]{.mark} in a context of a high concentration of mining and
refining supply]{.underline} in select countries and a changing
regulatory landscape that is increasingly focused on regionalisation,
recently [exemplified through policies]{.underline} or legislative
[proposals such as]{.underline} the **[I]{.underline}**nflation
**[R]{.underline}**eduction **[A]{.underline}**ct in the United States
and the Critical Raw Materials Act in the European Union,\" it stated.

On the refining side, China is expected to retain its dominant position,
processing more than 40% of all materials in scope, although for select
materials such as lithium, China's market share is expected to decline
from more than 90% in 2021 to 60-70% by 2030.

\"Such concentration could also offer opportunities to traditional
mining countries to develop refining activities domestically,\" the
report noted.

With 72 countries covering 82% of global emissions currently committed
to net-zero emissions, according to McKinsey\'s report, pressure is
building on the supply chain for key sources of renewable power.

"[The]{.underline} McKinsey [report is a **clear sign**]{.underline}
that domestic [[**mineral resources** are needed as **geopolitical
issues** impact]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[mineral value chain]{.mark}
needed for]{.underline} the [energy transition]{.underline}," wrote
Douglas Wicks, project director at the US Advanced Research Projects
Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).

[We are [on]{.mark} the [**brink** of]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[[irreversible]{.mark} climate [disaster]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
is a global emergency beyond any doubt. Much of [the very fabric of life
on Earth is **imperiled**. We are stepping into a [**critical** and
**unpredictable** new phase of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis. For many years,
**[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including a group of [more than
[**15,000**, have sounded]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[alarm]{.mark}
about]{.underline} the [impending dangers of climate change]{.underline}
driven by increasing greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem change
(Ripple et al. 2020). For half a century, global [warming has been
correctly predicted even before it was observed]{.underline}---and not
only by independent academic scientists but also by fossil fuel
companies (Supran et al. 2023). Despite these warnings, [we are
[**still** moving in]{.mark} the **[wrong direction]{.mark}**; fossil
fuel emissions have increased to]{.underline} an [all-time
high]{.underline}, the 3 hottest days ever occurred in July of 2024
(Guterres 2024), and [current policies have us [on track
for]{.mark}]{.underline} approximately [**[2.7]{.mark}**
degrees]{.underline} Celsius (°C) peak warming by 2100 (UNEP 2023).
Tragically, [we are failing to avoid **serious impacts**]{.underline},
and we can now only hope to limit the extent of the damage. We are
witnessing the grim reality of the forecasts as [climate
impacts]{.underline} escalate, [bringing forth]{.underline} scenes of
**[unprecedented disasters]{.underline}** around the world and human and
nonhuman suffering. We find ourselves amid an abrupt climate upheaval, a
dire situation never before encountered in the annals of human
existence. We have now brought the planet into climatic conditions never
witnessed by us or our prehistoric relatives within our
genus, Homo (supplemental figure S1; CenCO2PIP Consortium et al. 2023).

Last year, we witnessed [**record-breaking** sea surface
temperatures]{.underline} (Cheng et al. 2024), the hottest Northern
Hemisphere extratropical summer in 2000 years (Esper et al. 2024), and
the [breaking of]{.underline} many other **[climate
records]{.underline}** (Ripple et al. 2023a). Moreover, we will see much
more extreme weather in the coming years (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2021).
[[**Human**-caused]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon dioxide
[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} and other greenhouse gases
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[primary drivers]{.mark} of climate
change]{.underline}**. As of 2022, global fossil fuel combustion and
industrial processes account for approximately 90% of these emissions,
whereas land-use change, primarily deforestation, accounts for
approximately 10% (supplemental figure S2).

Our aim in the present article is to communicate directly to
researchers, policymakers, and the public. As scientists and academics,
we feel it is our moral duty and that of our institutions to alert
humanity to the growing threats that we face as clearly as possible and
to show leadership in addressing them. In this report, we analyze the
latest trends in a wide array of planetary vital signs. We also review
notable recent climate-related disasters, spotlight important
climate-related topics, and discuss needed policy interventions. This
report is part of our series of concise annual updates on the state of
the climate.

Recent trends in planetary vital signs

In [2023]{.underline}, various historical [[temperature and ice]{.mark}
extent [records were **broken** by **enormous
margins**]{.mark}]{.underline} (figure 1; Ripple et al. 2023a). Both
global and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures were far above their
1991--2024 averages for much of the year---a pattern that has continued
well into 2024 (figure 1a, 1b). Although Antarctic and global sea **[ice
extent]{.underline}** have now come into range of previous years, they
[remain well below]{.underline} their [1993--2024 averages]{.underline}
(figure 1c, 1d). Global daily mean temperatures were at record levels
for nearly half of 2023 and much of 2024 (figure 1e). On our current
emissions trajectory, we may regularly surpass current temperature
records in future years (Matthews and Wynes 2022).

The human enterprise

Our graphical account illustrates how [humanity\'s]{.underline}
collective [size and **consumption**]{.underline} patterns [continued to
accelerate]{.underline} on multiple fronts. Although fertility rates
were down slightly to a record low in 2023, other variables set all-time
record highs, including human population, ruminant livestock population,
per capita meat production, and gross domestic product (GDP;
figure 2a--2e). Human population and ruminant livestock population have
been increasing at approximately 200,000 and 170,000 per day
respectively. Decoupling the growth in all of these variables with
greenhouse gas emissions may be difficult (Ripple et al. 2024).

Energy

[**[Fossil fuel consumption]{.mark}** rose]{.underline} by 1.5% in 2023
relative to 2022 (figure 2h), mostly because of substantial increases in
coal consumption (1.6%) and oil consumption (2.5%; figure 2h). Renewable
energy use also grew in 2023, with solar and wind consumption together
rising 15% relative to 2022 (figure 2h). Much of this growth can be
attributed to the fact that renewable energy is often cheaper than
comparable new fossil fuel alternatives (Roser 2020). However, fossil
fuel consumption [[remains]{.mark} roughly [**14 times greater** than
solar and wind]{.mark} energy consumption]{.underline} (figure 2h) and
[recent growth in]{.underline} the **[renewable share]{.underline}** of
electricity generation mostly [covered increased **demand**, instead of
**replacing fossil fuels**]{.underline} (REN21 2024).

Forests

Global [**tree cover loss** rose]{.underline} from 22.8 megahectares
(Mha) per year in 2022 to 28.3 Mha per year in 2023, [reaching its
third-highest level]{.underline} (figure 2f); this was at least [partly
because of **wildfires**]{.underline}, which caused tree cover loss to
reach a record high of 11.9 Mha (figure 3n). High rates of [**[tree
cover loss]{.mark}** can [drive]{.mark}]{.underline} a set of related
**[[feedback loops]{.underline}]{.mark}**, wherein the [loss of forest
carbon sequestration leads to **additional warming**]{.underline}, which
can drive further losses in carbon sequestration and so on (Ripple
et al. 2023b, Goldman and Carter 2024). [This]{.underline} type of
climate carbon **[feedback]{.underline}** process [could
**[limit]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [success of]{.underline} some
**[[natural]{.mark} climate [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2023,
there was also a dramatic decline in the land carbon sink according to
Ke and colleagues (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.12447 \[preprint:
not peer reviewed\]). On a more positive note, the deforestation rate in
the Brazilian Amazon continued to decline, dropping from 1.16 Mha in
2022 to 0.90 Mha in 2023 (figure 2g). This decrease may be partly
because of the shifting policies of Brazil\'s government (Vilani
et al. 2023) and comes at a critical time given that the Amazon may be
nearing a tipping point where a loss of resilience and positive feedback
loops contribute to large-scale forest dieback (Boulton et al. 2022,
Flores et al. 2024).

Global greenhouse gases and temperature

Annual [energy]{.underline}-related [emissions
**increased**]{.underline} 2.1% in 2023, and are now above 40 gigatons
of carbon-dioxide-equivalent for the first time (figure 2k). The top
three emitting countries are China, the United States, and India, which,
together, account for over half of global emissions (supplemental table
S2). Anthropogenic emissions of aerosol pollutants are declining;
because these aerosols have a net cooling effect, this reduction may be
causing the rate of global warming to accelerate (Hansen et al. 2023).
On the basis of global year-to-date averages, the [concentrations of
carbon dioxide and methane are at **record highs**]{.underline}
(figure 3a, 3b). Carbon dioxide levels were recently observed to be
surging (NOAA 2024). Furthermore, the growth rate of methane emissions
has been accelerating, which is very troubling (Shindell et al. 2024).
Nitrous oxide is also at a record high (figure 3c); annual anthropogenic
emissions of this potent long-lived greenhouse gas have increased by
roughly 40% from 1980 to 2020 (Tian et al. 2024).

[Surface temperature is at a **record high**]{.underline}, and 2024 is
expected to be one of the hottest years ever recorded (figure 3d). Each
0.1°C of global warming places an extra 100 million people (or more)
into unprecedented hot average temperatures (Lenton et al. 2023). On our
current trajectory, future years will almost certainly be even hotter,
because our climate continues to shift away from conditions associated
with human thriving for much of Earth\'s population (Vecellio
et al. 2023). Even in the most optimistic scenarios, large-scale climate
adaptation efforts will be needed, particularly for the most vulnerable
populations (Ripple et al. 2022).

Oceans and ice

Ocean acidity and ocean heat content are both at record extremes
(figure 3f, 3g), which has led to various ocean-related climate impacts.
For example, heat waves in 2021 and 2023 caused marine animal mass
mortality events (White et al. 2023, Goreau and Hayes 2024). In
addition, the average [global [sea level is]{.mark} presently
[at]{.mark} a **[record high]{.mark}**]{.underline}, mostly because of
both overall warming and a strong El Niño in 2023 and part of 2024
(figure 3h; Lee 2024). Continued sea level rise [has]{.underline} the
[potential to displace **hundreds of millions** of people]{.underline}
over the course of the century (Kulp and Strauss 2019). Melting
continental ice contributes about half to sea level rise (Horwath
et al. 2021), and the latest data indicate that Greenland's ice mass,
Antarctica's ice mass, and the average glacier thickness are all at
record lows (figure 3j--3l).

Climate impacts and extreme weather

Climate-related extreme weather and disasters are contributing greatly
to human suffering (figure 4). Increasing heat and rainfall extremes are
now far outside the historical climate (Robinson et al. 2021). The
[rapid increase in average global temperatures]{.underline} (figure 1e)
has led to a massive rise in the incidence of heat extremes (figure 3p).
This is [linked to]{.underline} many [**adverse human outcomes**,
including]{.underline} direct [mortality]{.underline}, increased
[healthcare costs]{.underline}, mental health issues, and [deaths
from]{.underline} cardiorespiratory **[diseases]{.underline}** (Ebi
et al. 2021). Climate change has already contributed to billions of
people facing extreme heat (Arrighi et al. 2024). Heat-related mortality
is rising rapidly in the United States (Figure 2i); the number of
heat-related deaths increased by 117% from 1999 to 2023 (Howard et
al. 2024). Last year, there were four billion-dollar floods in the
United States (a tie for the record; figures 3o and S4). Since the
publication of our last report (Ripple et al. 2023a), numerous other
major climate-related disasters have occurred, including a series of
[**[heat waves]{.mark}** across Asia]{.underline} that [[killed more
than a **thousand**]{.mark} **people** and led to temperatures reaching
50°C]{.underline} in some parts of India (table 1). Because [the [Earth
system is **strongly nonlinear**, extreme weather]{.mark} and disaster
rates can [increase **dramatically**]{.mark} in response to]{.underline}
global **[warming]{.underline}**, including impacts on plant and animal
life (figure 3m, 3o and supplemental figures S4 and S5; Calvin 2019,
Robinson et al. 2021).

Climate spotlight

In the present section, we spotlight recent developments in various
different climate-related areas: coral bleaching, toxic orange rivers,
solar radiation modification (SRM) research, climate scientists' opinion
on global temperatures, climate change as a social justice issue,
climate feedback loops and tipping points, and the risk of societal
collapse.

Coral bleaching

Coral reefs benefit millions of people by providing a wide range of
ecosystem services, including coastal protection, improved water
quality, fisheries, and tourism opportunities; they also provide habitat
for many species (Woodhead et al. 2019). **[Climate]{.underline}**
change [is a particularly serious threat to **coral reefs**]{.underline}
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2017). Warm-water coral death is sometimes
preceded by bleaching---the loss of a symbiotic relationship with
microalgae (figure 5a; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2017). When a sharp spike
in sea temperature unfolds well above the long-term average summer
maximum, many [corals die **quickly** within a week or two without
having time to bleach]{.underline}. Others bleach and either die more
slowly over a period of a few months or regain their color and survive
(Hughes et al. 2018). As of 2024, extraordinarily [warm]{.underline}
ocean [[temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark} (figure 1a) [are
[driving]{.mark}]{.underline} the fourth **[[global]{.mark}-scale [coral
bleaching]{.mark}]{.underline}** event ever recorded (previous events:
1998, 2010, 2014--2017; Thiem 2024).

\[Figure 5 omitted\]

Toxic orange rivers

Climate change in the Arctic is altering watershed hydrology and water
biogeochemistry. Recently, researchers have observed an emergent threat
in Arctic streams that turned orange because of increased iron and toxic
metals (figure 5b). This discoloration began in the last decade,
coinciding with rapid global warming and permafrost thaw (O\'Donnell
et al. 2024). Compared with clear streams, orange streams are more
acidic, have higher turbidity, and have elevated sulfate, iron, and
trace metals. This discoloration correlates with declines in
macroinvertebrate diversity and fish abundance, affecting drinking water
and subsistence fisheries in rural Alaska (O\'Donnell et al. 2024).

Solar radiation modification research

SRM research, also known as solar geoengineering research, has been
dramatically increasing in recent years (figure 5c). It involves
potentially risky techniques to reflect sunlight away from Earth to
mitigate climate change effects. General categories of SRM include
atmospheric, terrestrial, and space-based applications (Keith 2020).
Specific methods, for example, include injecting aerosols into the
stratosphere or brightening marine clouds. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that stratospheric aerosol
injection is the most-researched SRM method, but there are a number of
environmental concerns (IPCC 2018, Visioni et al. 2020). SRMs are also
controversial because of potential unintended consequences and ethical
concerns. Critics argue that it is misguided and may disrupt weather
patterns and deter emissions reduction efforts (Whyte 2018). However,
research continues to explore its feasibility and risks. SRM is often
seen as a temporary, potentially important solution to both reduce
warming and corresponding damages including for the highly important and
fast-warming subpolar regions (Smith et al. 2022). Research into solar
geoengineering needs to focus on understanding the potential
environmental, social, and geopolitical impacts, as well as assessing
effectiveness and safety on both regional and global scales (Sovacool
et al. 2022). In addition, interdisciplinary research is required to
explore ethical, legal, and governance frameworks, along with public
perception and acceptance, while emphasizing the critical importance of
drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There is a consensus
study available as a roadmap for solar geoengineering research and
research governance (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2021).

Climate scientists' opinion on global temperatures

A [2024]{.underline} opinion [poll]{.underline} has
[unveiled]{.underline} the [**predictions** of **[hundreds of
prominent]{.mark} climate [scientists]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[IPCC, senior authors, and review editors (380
respondents)]{.underline}. From a personal perspective, nearly [**80%**
of]{.underline} these [scientists [anticipate]{.mark}]{.underline}
global [[temperatures increasing]{.mark} by **[at least
2.5]{.mark}°C**]{.underline} above preindustrial levels by the end of
the century (Carrington 2024). Nearly [half]{.underline} of them
[foresee]{.underline} a rise of [at least 3°C]{.underline}. A mere
[**6%** believe]{.underline} that the internationally agreed-on [limit
of 1.5°C will be achieved]{.underline} (figure 5d). This parallels an
earlier survey of IPCC scientists, which showed that approximately 60%
expected warming of at least 3°C (Tollefson 2021). These projections
paint a bleak picture of the future, with many [scientists
[envisioning]{.mark} widespread [**famines**, **conflicts**]{.mark},
mass **[migration]{.mark}**, and increasing extreme weather that [will
surpass **anything**]{.mark} **witnessed [thus far]{.mark}**[, posing
**catastrophic consequences** for]{.mark}]{.underline} both
[**[humanity]{.mark}** and the **biosphere**]{.underline}
(Carrington 2024). It is important to keep in mind, however, that such
characterizations can suffer from conflation of matters of science
(i.e., how much warming are we committed to for a given emissions
pathway) and matters of policy (what pathways are still possible and
what the obstacles are). There is no way to know, for example, whether
the polled IPCC physical scientists based their assessments on the
science or simply on their views of the political prospects for action
(Mann and Hayhoe 2024).

One of the numerous challenges for scientists is how to communicate
about climate change (Guenther 2024). Some have argued that attitudes of
pessimism and resignation can be obstructive to climate action.
Moreover, some say those who oppose action have resorted to alternative
strategies including the propagation of pessimism, because embracing a
sense of helplessness can undermine the motivation for action (Mann and
Hayhoe 2024). Conversely, it has also been suggested that optimism gives
rise to inaction, if people think things are fine and therefore action
is not needed (Wilson 2021). In any case, the importance of tone may be
overstated in this context, and more research is needed to better
identify motivating factors for climate action (Bamberg et al. 2018).

[With]{.underline} the increasingly [**undeniable effects** of climate
change]{.underline}, a [**dire assessment** is an **honest
assessment**[. Denying]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[existential
threat]{.mark}** posed by climate change [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
becoming [**[increasingly less plausible]{.mark}**. The fact
is]{.underline} that [[avoiding **every tenth of a degree of warming**
is **critically important**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than presenting
a climate change prognosis pessimistically or optimistically, we just
want to act truthfully and tell it like it is. We must emphasize both
urgency and agency when it comes to our characterizations of the needed
action on climate (Mann 2023).

Climate change as a social justice issue

Climate change is a matter of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI),
because the wealthy people that emit the most greenhouse gases are
generally less vulnerable to climate impacts (figure 5e). Although the
ramifications of emissions are global, they are particularly severe in
the Global South (Ngcamu 2023). [Vulnerability to climate change is
shaped by a complex interplay of social, economic, and political
factors, leaving historically diverse]{.underline}, underserved, [and
marginalized communities **disproportionately affected**]{.underline}
(Levy and Patz 2015). DEI principles underscore the urgency to address
these disparities. Embedding climate change within the framework of
organizational DEI activities may help to foster comprehensive and
meaningful progress toward equity and sustainability. By recognizing the
disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities,
organizations can work toward rectifying historical injustices by
funding countries in the Global South to maintain decarbonization while
addressing urgent climate change concerns. In addition, DEI
considerations are relevant to international climate policy; for
example, they can help guide efforts to rapidly and equitably phase out
fossil fuel extractions (Muttitt and Kartha 2020).

The ethical dimensions of climate change have led many faith leaders to
speak out on the issue (e.g., Nhat Hanh 2015, Pope Francis 2023). This
represents an opportunity for diverse communities to build alliances
around the issue.

Climate feedback loops and tipping points

Awareness and research need to increase on climate feedback loops.
Feedback loops are processes that can either amplify or reduce the
effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Many [[**significant feedback
loops** enhance warming]{.underline}]{.mark}. At least [**[28]{.mark}**
amplifying feedback loops [have been identified]{.mark}]{.underline}
(tables 2a, 2b). A particularly concerning feedback loop is the
[**[permafrost]{.mark}** feedback loop]{.underline}, which [involves
rising temperatures causing permafrost thawing]{.underline}. This
process [releases more carbon dioxide and methane, leading to **further
warming**]{.underline}. Areas of active climate feedback loop research
include [permafrost--cloud interactions]{.underline} (de Vrese
et al. 2024), [[glacier meltwater]{.underline}]{.mark} (Pelle
et al. 2023), [and **[biod]{.mark}**iversity]{.underline} (Weiskopf
et al. 2024). Because feedback loops are not yet fully integrated into
climate models, current emissions reduction plans might fall short in
adequately limiting future warming.

\[Table 2a and 2b omitted\]

Some climate feedback loops are linked to [**[tipping points]{.mark}**,
potentially [trigger]{.mark}ing major and **[irreversible
changes]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the [Earth system]{.underline} without
further pushing by human activities. Tipping elements are biophysical
systems on Earth with tipping point behavior that contribute to
regulating the climate system (Lenton et al. 2008). They have recently
been assessed for their tipping sensitivity. [**Five** of sixteen
climate tipping elements are likely to cross]{.underline} their tipping
points [at 1.5°C]{.underline}: the [**Greenland** ice
sheet]{.underline}, the [**West Antarctic** ice sheet, boreal
permafrost, low-latitude coral reefs, and]{.underline} the [Barents Sea
Ice]{.underline} (Armstrong McKay et al. 2022). Several climate [tipping
elements are connected]{.underline}, and [if [one]{.mark} tips, others
[may]{.mark} tip, **[trigger]{.mark}**ing a **[tipping point
cascade]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Wunderling et al. 2024). Overall, this
points to a complex situation where climate controlling feedback loops
and tipping point systems are interconnected in a way that could trigger
self-perpetuating processes that amplify warming beyond human control.
Therefore, we recommend the IPCC publish a special report on feedback
loops and tipping points.

Risk of societal collapse

The [**climate emergency** is not]{.underline} an
**[isolated]{.underline}** issue. [Global
**[heating]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although it [[is]{.mark}
**catastrophic**]{.underline}, is [merely [one aspect
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**profound [polycrisis]{.mark}** that
includes environmental degradation]{.underline}, rising [economic
**inequality**, and **biodiversity**]{.underline} loss (Hoyer
et al. 2023). Climate change is a glaring symptom of a deeper systemic
issue: ecological overshoot, where human consumption outpaces the
Earth\'s ability to regenerate (Rees 2023, Ripple et al. 2024).
Overshoot is an inherently unstable state that cannot persist
indefinitely. As pressures increase and the risk of Earth\'s climate
system switching to a catastrophic state rises (Steffen et al. 2018),
[**more and more scientists** have begun to research]{.underline} the
possibility of **[societal collapse]{.underline}** (Brozović 2023). Even
in the absence of global collapse, climate change could cause many
millions of additional deaths by 2050 (WHO 2023).

Along with the broader danger of overshoot, [**[climate change]{.mark}**
could contribute to]{.underline} a [collapse by
**[increas]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} the [[likelihood of **catastrophic
risks**]{.mark} such as [**international conflict** or]{.mark} by
causing **multiple stresses**, resulting in
**[system-wide]{.mark}**]{.underline} synchronous
[[failures]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kemp et al. 2022). The number of
published articles using climate change and societal collapse language
has been dramatically increasing (figure 5f; supplemental methods).
[Climate change has]{.underline} already displaced millions of people,
and has the [potential to displace **hundreds**]{.underline} of millions
or even billions more, [leading to greater **geopolitical
instability**]{.underline} (Table S3). By the end of the century,
roughly one-third of people worldwide could be outside the human climate
niche, facing increased risk of illness and early death, famine, and a
host of other adverse outcomes (Lenton et al. 2023).

#### The plan solves. It expands US development and exploration of Greenland mineral reserves, guaranteeing [access]{.underline} and bolstering [relations]{.underline}.

Emily **Hardy 24**, James C. Gaither Junior Fellow in the
Sustainability, Climate, and Geopolitics Program at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, et al., \"Don't Buy Greenland, Buy
Its Minerals," 6/26/2024,
https://ip-quarterly.com/en/dont-buy-greenland-buy-its-minerals

Former US president and real estate mogul Donald [**Trump**
sought]{.underline} his biggest [purchase of]{.underline} all when he
tried to buy [Greenland]{.underline}, an autonomous Danish territory in
the North Atlantic, in 2019. Trump's proposition---which he called
"essentially a large real estate deal"---was just the latest instance of
the United States government considering acquiring Greenland, most
recently with a \$100 million offer in 1946, which Denmark rejected. In
this case, [Trump failed to grasp the true art of the deal: It's not
about buying Greenland---the **true value**]{.underline} for all parties
[comes from **developing** what lies beneath]{.underline}.

Underground Riches

With a population of just 57,000 today, Greenland was a Danish colony
until it achieved home rule in 1979. The Self-Government Act of 2009
entrusted Greenland with additional domestic responsibilities, whilst
Denmark retained control of its foreign affairs, defense, and monetary
policy. Since 2010, [[Greenland's autonomy]{.mark} has
**[extend]{.mark}**ed [to its]{.mark} subsoil resources, including
[**mineral exploration** and exploitation]{.mark}
activities]{.underline}.

[[Endowed with deposits of **rare earth elements**]{.mark}, graphite,
and lithium, [Greenland has]{.mark} many of [the raw inputs needed for
**e**]{.mark}lectric **[v]{.mark}**ehicle[**s**, wind turbines, and
**transmission**]{.mark} lines. [These]{.mark}]{.underline} final
products [[are necessary for]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[clean
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** transition, [but]{.underline} the
[[current extraction]{.mark} and processing]{.underline} of raw
materials [[has been monopolized by states **inimical** to
US]{.underline}]{.mark} interests, [like China]{.underline}. 

In 2021, China produced roughly 98 percent of global gallium, 82 percent
of global natural graphite, and 60 percent of processed rare earth
elements. But it is not just China's saturation of the global mineral
market that jeopardizes security; it is also [the degree of
[US]{.mark}]{.underline} and European Union **[[import
reliance]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [has [yielded]{.mark} a
[system]{.mark} highly [vulnerable to supply **bottlenecks**]{.mark} and
geopolitical extortion]{.underline}. China accounts for 72 percent
of American import sources for rare earth compounds and 42 percent
for graphite. Europe relies on Chinese imports for 100 percent of its
heavy rare earth supply. [This]{.underline} reliance [[poses]{.mark} a
[threat to **national security**]{.mark} as geopolitical tensions could
endanger]{.underline} the [US]{.underline} and EU's [ability to
manufacture technologies]{.underline} essential to the energy
transition.

Countering China's Mineral Supremacy

Recognition of this security risk has driven [G7 allies]{.underline} to
insulate supply chains from China. They [are pursuing
**[friendshoring]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a policy that promotes mineral
extraction and processing in states with shared political interests. In
[2022]{.underline}, the [Biden]{.underline} administration
[united]{.underline} a [coalition of]{.underline} 14 [friendly actors
through]{.underline} the [Minerals Security Partnership]{.underline}
with the hopes of securing supply chains for the energy transition. But
[that [has turned out to be **easier said than
done**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

As Washington and Brussels wrestle with the political challenges of
material sourcing, the [[demand for]{.mark} critical [minerals
**continues to grow**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The need for graphite will
increase by 25 times due to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing alone.
Enter Greenland. If fully developed, Greenland's 6 Mt of known graphite
resources alone could exceed the projected EV demand for 2040 (3.5 Mt)
and counter Chinese mineral supremacy. [[Supply diversification could
be]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [**[useful]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} both [the US]{.underline}, which imported 100 percent
of its natural graphite in 2023 and sourced 42 percent of that from
China, and the EU, for whom the comparable figures in 2020 were 98
percent and 47 percent. [Western dependency was exploited in **2023**
when China imposed graphite]{.underline} export [restrictions in
retaliation for US limits on]{.underline} the sale of
[semiconductors]{.underline}.

Yet [Greenland has **more than graphite**. Its most significant deposits
are rare earth elements]{.underline}, such as neodymium, which are
inputs to technologies ranging from wind turbines to nuclear reactors.
Currently, [China dominates]{.underline} the supply, [with **44 Mt**
of]{.underline} rare earth oxides [(REOs)]{.underline} reserves.
[Estimates suggest]{.underline} that [Greenland could possess **42 Mt**
of REOs]{.underline}. If this potential is realized, [[Greenland]{.mark}
would [have]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**second-largest reserves** of
**r**]{.mark}are **[e]{.mark}**arth
**[e]{.mark}**lement**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, surpassing Vietnam,
Brazil, and Russia.

Mining Politics in Greenland

[[Key]{.underline}]{.mark} political [[actors]{.mark} in Greenland have
indicated **[support]{.mark}** for [developing]{.mark} their
[mining]{.mark} industry. All seven parties]{.underline} in Greenland's
parliament, [including the]{.underline} governing [Inuit]{.underline}
Ataqatigiit (IA) party, [recognize the importance of **investing** in
the mining sector]{.underline} to promote future prosperity. Despite
stated interest, Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede's government
issued a ban on uranium exploitation that exceeds 100 ppm in 2021. The
ban was instated following local opposition to the Kvanefjeld
mine project, which planned to dispose of uranium waste near the town of
Narsaq. This ban challenges rare earth element extraction as uranium is
commonly found alongside deposits. 

Beyond political diffuculties, [[Greenland faces]{.underline}]{.mark}
other [**[obstacles]{.mark}** to mining]{.underline}. First, it
is challenging to mine [due to]{.underline} Greenland's
"[[remoteness]{.mark}, harsh [climate]{.mark}, and **[lack of
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}." At present, [[there are
only **two**]{.underline}]{.mark} operating [[mines]{.mark} in
Greenland, [neither]{.mark} of which [extract **critical
minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Investors hoping to expand into the
critical minerals space may, therefore, face [[first-mover **concerns**
exacerbated by]{.mark} high costs of infrastructure and [lack of]{.mark}
geological **[mapping]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Greenland also has a
limited available workforce to participate in the mining industry, which
forces companies to rely on foreign workers.

While there are potential barriers, [thoughtful [government coordination
could **alleviate**]{.mark}]{.underline} key [[concerns]{.mark} and
[open]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[door for]{.mark} new]{.underline}
private **[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. After
all, [[Greenland has a **stable**]{.mark} **political
[environment]{.mark}**, comparatively [low]{.mark} investment [risks,
and a pro-mining government]{.mark}]{.underline}---in sum,
[a]{.underline} more [**desirable** partner]{.underline} than many other
resource-rich states. [Not to mention its strategic]{.underline}
Atlantic [real estate]{.underline} with secure sea lanes to both North
American and European markets.

Chinese Ambitions

[The [opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[will **not
wait**]{.underline}]{.mark} for meaningful transatlantic partnerships
forever, as [other actors are]{.underline} already [taking note.
[Chinese companies are pursuing mining]{.mark} in Greenland]{.underline}
and though many of these projects have not come to fruition, Greenland
is still key to Beijing's Polar Silk Road ambitions.

The EU launched the first attempt to counter Chinese influence, signing
a Memorandum of Understanding in November 2023 for a
strategic minerals partnership with Greenland. On March 15, the European
Commission launched a €22.5 million Green Growth program. Although the
Memorandum of Understanding does not stipulate trade, extraction, or
export requirements, the intention is clear: recruit Greenland for the
EU's clean energy initiatives, such as the European Raw Materials
Alliance, and ward off Chinese intervention. Following suit, [the [US
should **supplement**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[EU's **initial**
investment through]{.mark} a [partnership]{.mark} with
Greenland]{.underline}.

What is the US up to? Under the Trump and Biden administrations, the US
has penned a series of agreements with allies to establish a core
constituency of like-minded, demand-oriented partners attempting to
diversify their supply chains. As the US continues to solidify deals
with longstanding allies, attention must turn to a new set of
arrangements with less obvious partners. The launch of the MSP Forum is
the first step toward building a supply-side cadre with robust support
from the US and EU. While [Greenland]{.underline} would benefit from
inclusion in the forum, its [[**mining industry** will
require]{.underline}]{.mark} additional [**[support]{.mark}** to
succeed]{.underline}. 

Fortunately, [the [groundwork has **already been laid**]{.mark}. In
2020, the US opened a consulate in Nuuk]{.underline}---perhaps as a
constructive consolation for Trump's failed acquisition. Two years
later, under the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration,
[[**USAID** launched]{.mark} a]{.underline} two-year [Enterprise-Driven
[Growth Initiative]{.mark} (EDGI) to support Greenland's]{.underline}
commercial coordination and US trade [relationship. Yet
**[despite]{.mark} these [efforts]{.mark}**[, the industry is **not
biting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of the 41 companies that held operating
licenses in Greenland in 2021, none were US-owned, and there is little
indication of progress. 

A New Kind of Mineral Agreement

The end of EDGI's project lifespan in June 2024 presents an opening for
a new kind of catalytic agreement targeting Greenland's mining sector.
The partnership's core mandate should be lowering barriers to crowd in
private investment from US and allied raw material producers. With this
goal in mind, [[a **development-oriented**]{.mark} critical [minerals
agreement must address]{.mark}]{.underline} three **[[key
bottlenecks]{.underline}]{.mark}**: resource mapping, early investment
anxiety, and labor challenges.

[[On]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**exploration** front]{.mark}, technical
[assistance from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[US G]{.mark}**eological
**[S]{.mark}**urvey, [NASA, and mining engineering]{.mark}
institutions]{.underline} like the Colorado School of Mines [[should
expand]{.mark} on]{.underline} the information in [Greenland's
existing [Mineral Resource Portal]{.mark}]{.underline}. US programs like
the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative [could [provide **precise**
assessments of]{.mark} subsoil [resources]{.mark}---without digging up
half of the country]{.underline}. 

[[As]{.mark} accurate, low-impact [assessments are produced, attention
can turn to **de-risking**]{.mark} **new [ventures]{.mark}** for
US]{.underline} and EU [firms. [The US]{.mark} Export-Import Bank
[(**EXIM**) should]{.mark} continue **[collaborat]{.mark}**ing with
industry]{.underline} and Greenland's ministries responsible
[[for]{.mark} mineral **[licensing]{.mark}** to expand eligibility
for]{.underline} competitive [loans, guarantees, and
insurance]{.underline} to new sites. EXIM's lending package to the
Australian-owned Citronen Zinc mine in Greenland's northern territory
should be extended to other firms looking to outmaneuver Chinese
investment. 

Europe has a role to play, too. The European Investment Bank could
bolster this financing strategy by offering new investment partnerships
for industrial buildout, following a similar model to its recent raw
materials investment partnership with Rwanda. EIB and EXIM should offer
these services through initiatives designed to increase competitiveness
with Chinese firms, such as 402(A) direct China competition
transactions. In conjunction with EXIM, the trade and development
agencies can support early expansion of industrial capacity by financing
feasibility assessments for new projects that evaluate not only
environmental impacts but also cascading effects on existing sectors
like tourism and fishing.

Finally, [[the US]{.mark} International Trade Advisory Committee on
Critical Minerals [(**ITAC5**) can]{.mark}]{.underline} also [play a
critical role in **[catch]{.mark}**ing [the industry's
**eye**]{.mark}]{.underline} given its composition of industry
executives. Alongside transatlantic policy planning bodiesand the
Greenlandic Mineral Resources Authority, [ITAC5 should produce
recommendations]{.underline} designed to lower trade barriers and
prepare the ground [[for]{.mark} greater
[investment]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

Another issue is [the labor force]{.underline}, which [will need to grow
as firms move in and industrial capacity **expands**]{.underline} on the
sparsely populated island. While Greenland's existing labor capacity can
absorb a small fraction of demand, foreign workers will be required
across the value chain. In collaboration with Greenland's government,
the [[US Department of Labor could assist with
develouping]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[strategy for]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[mining industry]{.underline}]{.mark}, ensuring equitable and
inclusive provisions for Greenland's domestic workforce and native
population. 

[[Blank checks]{.mark} and vague commitments [will **fail** to
catalyze]{.mark} a new [mining industrial base]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the North Atlantic. However, [[dedicated coordination and]{.mark}
targeted [finance]{.mark}]{.underline} from transatlantic partners
[[could **jumpstart** Greenland's]{.mark} nascent [capacity]{.mark} to
offer]{.underline} a [new source of raw materials]{.underline} necessary
for a secure energy transition. As the US and EU confront heightened
supply chain vulnerability and Greenland seeks greater economic
autonomy, both polities stand to gain from further collaboration.
Although an outright Trump-style purchase of Greenland is off the table,
[a **mineral partnership** could facilitate a]{.underline} smooth
[energy transition]{.underline}. It's about time that the transatlantic
allies work to develop Greenland's minerals. 

#### Greenland [seeks]{.underline} investment, but only the US has the [capacity]{.underline} to scale up mining operations\-\--EU investment is [futile]{.underline}.

Sumantra **Maitra 25**, director of research and outreach at the
American Ideas Institute, 5/29/2025, \"Time for a 'Big, Beautiful Deal'
for Greenland,\"

["[We **want** to develop our business sector]{.mark}]{.underline} and
diversify it, and [[that requires investments from
**outside**]{.underline}]{.mark}", Naaja [Nathanielsen, Greenland's
**business minister** told]{.underline} the **[F]{.underline}**inancial
**[T]{.underline}**imes in a recent interview, hinting at
[China]{.underline} to [fill the gap if the U.S.]{.underline} and EU
[don't come out to play]{.underline}: ''We do want to partner up with
European and American partners. But if they don't show up I think we
need to look elsewhere."  

Asked about the sudden American interest in Greenland, the minister
said, "[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} sort of
**[[hoped]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[would]{.mark} be more willing to [engage]{.mark} in
dialogue [with Greenland about]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[mineral]{.mark} sector **[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We got a
bit more than we asked for, because we have no wish to be American." 

Regular readers of this esteemed publication may recall her name from
a detailed interview in which she spoke in similar terms about American
investment in Greenland. "[There are ample opportunities for American
investors to engage themselves in Greenland]{.underline}, not only in
the mining sector, but in other sectors as well," she told us. She's
correct. And [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should make the Greenlanders an offer]{.underline}. 

There are many essays about the historic interest of the United States
about Greenland, including from yours truly. That need not be rehashed,
but the structural question remains underdiscussed. Greenland is a
massive island, three times the size of Texas, but with a population
that could fit in a football stadium with plenty of elbow room. Any
major investment that could make individual Greenlanders all
millionaires and Greenland the richest island in the Western Hemisphere
will come with some strings attached. No one would want to invest in a
place that doesn't benefit them too: The profit motive works both ways.
A second point: [[Everyone]{.mark} who would **want** to invest [would
need **manpower**]{.mark}]{.underline} to work in the projects involved.
The scale of projects that Nathanielsen envisions [would
[require]{.mark}]{.underline} not just massive amounts of cash, but also
[[**infrastructure** and]{.underline}]{.mark}, most importantly, skilled
**[[labor]{.underline}]{.mark}** and training for said labor. 

To her credit, Nathanielsen understands that. In her Financial
Times interview, [she mentioned]{.underline} that [Greenland was
"having]{.underline} a [difficult time finding]{.underline} our
[footing]{.underline}" in a changing geopolitical landscape, as [the
U.S. is considered **just as predatory** as China. She
considers]{.underline} the [[EU]{.underline}]{.mark} as [a natural
fit]{.underline}, and aligned on environmental metrics.

Unfortunately, [that [is the **key problem**]{.mark}. The EU
is]{.underline} simply [[not capable of investing]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[amount required, nor]{.mark} does it [have]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[expertise]{.underline}]{.mark} or hardware production capacity.
[[EU structures prohibit]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[degree of
**r**]{.underline}]{.mark}esearch [[and
**d**]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment [[required to make Greenland a
mining]{.underline}]{.mark} and trading [[hub]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
Singapore on the Arctic. The Ukraine war should have made it clear by
now just how much [the EU lags in hardware production]{.underline}.
Individual countries can invest, of course. Denmark and France are
investing in some mining in Greenland, but the amount runs to mere
millions of euros in total. European GDP, investment, research, and tech
was at parity with the U.S. up until 2008. The U.S. dwarfs the EU now. 

Then there is this question of security. Arctic security will be a
headache to Europe in the coming decades. Given China's closeness to
Russia and its material aid in the Ukraine conflict, it is unlikely that
Europeans would desire major Chinese investment (and Chinese or Russian
intelligence-gathering) in a place that essentially looks over their
northern trade routes. It is not just an American concern, but a
European concern as well. Consider, also, how the Chinese are
increasingly wrecking strategic competition by buying up assets.
The case of British Steel and the Chinese control of Hutchison Port
Holdings in Panama should be cautionary tales for Europeans courting
Chinese investment. Without any provision of American security but with
potential Russo-Chinese--aligned military interest, inviting such
investment is self-destructive. 

For what it is worth, the Americans do already have an underused
military base there. [[An initial investment]{.mark} in
modifying]{.underline} the [infrastructure]{.underline} of that base
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} itself instantly [[pour billions in
Greenland's economy]{.mark}, saturate]{.underline} the [labor market,
and provide]{.underline} a [job]{.underline} or business [for
every]{.underline} single [Greenlander]{.underline}. 

But that's not all. Another instant investment could be in the tourism
sector and markets of Greenland. "Most of the tourism is
government-owned and controlled and independent investors and operators
are squeezed out and disadvantaged in many ways," the former Ambassador
to Denmark Carla Sands told *The American Conservative*. "We can give
individuals an opportunity to be entrepreneurs and build a private
sector tourism ecosystem in Greenland. They have magnificent sights and
amazing food. They need to do better in tourist offerings, more
restaurant options, hotels, the whole experience. Iceland can be a good
example. Greenland's government cooperated with the U.S. Interior
Department at my request in the first Trump administration. The
department helped Greenlanders with some knowledge transfer to grow
their tourism while protecting their pristine nature."

[[A few **simple** and **overnight changes** can instantly turn
Greenland into a]{.underline}]{.mark} First-World [[trading
hub]{.underline}]{.mark}. Reykjavik in Iceland gets around 2,000 flights
monthly. The total cost of American investment in hospitality, tourism,
a modern state-of-the-art airport, language and specialist training
programs, a bilingual or English-language radio or TV channel, and
fishing lanes between New England or Alaska and Greenland would be
peanuts compared American spending on USAID, but would instantly turn
Greenland into a hub of both future European and American investment,
including in the much-touted mining sector. A casual work visa system
between Denmark and the U.S. could provide jobs and opportunities to
both Danes and Americans in the potential expanding sectors. One
fact-finding trip from the Congressional Greenland Caucus can start that
process overnight. 

"[[Greenland is not just rich in **critical minerals**---it's a vital
partner]{.mark} in a region growing more important to]{.underline}
global [security and trade. **[Strengthening]{.mark} our
[relationship]{.mark}** [would bring investment]{.mark}]{.underline} and
tourism [to Greenland's economy [while reinforcing]{.mark} democratic
[partnerships in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Representative
Davidson, founder of the Congressional Greenland Caucus. "[If we fail to
show up, others will]{.underline}---and we may not like the terms they
bring."

[It is understandable]{.underline} that [[Greenlanders are chafing
from]{.underline}]{.mark}, shall we say, [uneven diplomacy from [this
administration]{.mark}'s initial days. [That storm has **now
passed**]{.mark}, and the rhetoric **stabilized**]{.underline}. But
[avoiding the U.S. in favor of]{.underline} the [Chinese-Russian embrace
is a]{.underline} long-term **[security risk]{.underline}** that prudent
Greenlanders would be smart to avoid. And [[the EU is **incapable** of
replacing **America**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}, in both
security and trade. [It is a mutually beneficial opportunity for
both]{.underline} the [U.S. and Greenland to initiate a]{.underline}
big, beautiful [deal]{.underline}---without all the loose and aggressive
talk.

expansionist threats herald a stormy relationship between the US and its
allies.\" EL PAÍS English. 1-8-2025.

It is no longer just outbursts. Donald [[**Trump** has gone]{.mark} a
[step further]{.mark}]{.underline} and has moved [[on to
**threats**]{.mark}: the [use of **military pressure against
Greenland**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a territory that belongs to a European
and NATO partner, Denmark. An economic boycott against Canada. A Gulf of
Mexico converted, by decree, into the "Gulf of America." Economic and
military obstacles to Panama to force it to return the canal that
Washington handed over under the agreements reached during Jimmy
Carter's presidency (1977-1981).

These are some of the perspectives that Trump has raised before the
start of his presidential term on January 20. The president-elect
offered a preview in a chaotic address on Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago
mansion in Florida that was part rambling soliloquy and part news
conference, and [which [has increased]{.mark} the [**anxiety of European
allies** about]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[direction of U.S.
policy]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [next four years and]{.underline} the
[**style of its diplomacy**. There are]{.underline} also [[concerns
about]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[future of **Euro-Atlantic
relations**]{.mark} ― which [reached a **high point**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the Joe [[Biden]{.mark}
administration]{.underline} on issues such as Russia's war against
Ukraine ― [and whether [these]{.mark}]{.underline} relations [[could
**deteriorate**, rewriting]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[global
geopolitical scenario at]{.mark} an especially **[delicate
moment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In his speech, [[Trump outlined]{.underline}]{.mark} a [foreign [policy
of **expansionism**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Americas and
confrontation with Europe. He threatened Canada, which he believes
should be an American state, with tariffs and economic pressure, and
attacked Mexico, "controlled by the cartels." He promised that "all hell
will break out" if the hostages in Gaza are not released by the time he
takes office. And, above all, [he [**refused to rule out** using
economic or military coercion for]{.mark}]{.underline} what he declared
to be two objectives necessary for national security: control of the
Panama Canal, where he believes China is making inroads, and [the
[annexation of **Greenland**]{.mark}]{.underline}, an island four times
the size of Spain, [rich in **rare minerals** and in a privileged
position in the Arctic]{.underline} to rival Russia and China.

He had previously expressed these positions, but since his election
victory in November they have become a recurring theme in his public
addresses. And he repeated them again, mockingly, on his social network,
Truth, hours after his appearance, when he published two maps in which
Canada showed up as U.S. territory.

During the first weeks of the presidential transition, [such
[statements]{.mark}]{.underline} sounded like little more than bravado.
But with 10 days to go before his inauguration, they [[are beginning to
sound **much more serious**, even if]{.mark} they [only turn out to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}, as some analysts suggest, [a [tactic to
open]{.mark} a [negotiation from]{.mark} a [position of
strength]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion
[[and **NATO's**]{.mark} European [allies are **nervously
awaiting**]{.mark}]{.underline} the official [return of
Trump]{.underline}, who has promised to raise tariffs on European
products and has called for increased defense spending, threatening to
withdraw protection from those who do not comply. But [his [rhetoric
about **Greenland**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which for 600 years has been
part of the Kingdom of Denmark ― a EU country and NATO member and
therefore an ally of the U.S. ― [[goes **beyond anything seen so
far**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"[[Trump's position is **very worrisome**]{.underline}]{.mark}," said an
alarmed senior European source who asked to remain anonymous in order to
speak freely about a very delicate issue in [Brussels]{.underline},
which is [preparing to negotiate a deal]{.underline} with the new
Administration [to avoid]{.underline} a trade [escalation. "It is
[worrisome]{.mark} not only [because]{.mark} of]{.underline} the [future
outlook and whether he will **act on Greenland** or not, but also
because [it represents]{.mark}]{.underline} yet [[another form of
**interference** that could **shake relations between Europe and the
U.S.**]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said.

Tonino **Picula 23**, Member of the European Parliament for Croatia,

Group Coordinator for Foreign Affairs, 12/12/2023, \"EU-US relations:
key to geopolitical stability,\"
https://www.socialeurope.eu/eu-us-relations-key-to-geopolitical-stability

[In]{.underline} an [era marked by **geopolitical**]{.underline} shifts
and **[crises]{.underline}**, the enduring significance of transatlantic
[[**unity** between]{.mark} the **[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion [[and]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is]{.mark} **more [critical]{.mark} than ever**]{.underline}. The
recent report on EU-US relations to the European Parliament from its
Foreign Affairs Committee (for which I was rapporteur), to be debated in
plenary today, is a timely reminder.

As the world grapples with multifaceted challenges, the report not only
underscores our shared values and interests but also charts a course for
deepening this vital partnership in pursuit of global stability and
prosperity. Its central thesis is that [the EU and]{.underline} the [US
must commit to a **strengthened partnership** rooted in]{.underline}
leadership, responsibility and [multilateralism. This is essential [for
tackling **global challenges** that **threaten**]{.mark}]{.underline}
our common values, **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}** and economic
wellbeing.

Tangible benefits

Among domains where co-operation can yield tangible benefits, foremost
is digital and technological innovation. As highlighted in an EIT
Digital report on transatlantic relations in June, stronger regulatory
alignment and integrated research and development are crucial,
especially in strategic sectors such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals,
batteries and rare earths. These are vital due to their vulnerable
supply chains amid heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly with
China's rise and the impacts of Russia's aggression in Ukraine.

The shift in global trade dynamics marked by the US importing more from
Europe than from China in 2022 underscores the importance of the
transatlantic economic relationship in the global economic order. This
is testament to the strength and potential of our partnership, aligning
closely with the values of equitable economic growth and co-operation.

The [EU-US Trade and Technology Council (**[TTC]{.mark}**)]{.underline}
has emerged as a key vehicle for advancing transatlantic dialogue. It
[[provides an effective]{.mark}, high-level [platform for]{.mark}
co-ordinating approaches to]{.underline} global-[[trade]{.mark},
economic and [technological issues, combating **disinfo**]{.mark}rmation
[and supporting Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [US is urged
to]{.underline} continue its solidarity while closely
[work]{.underline}ing [with the EU to protect **peace**, **security**
and democracy in Europe, as well as [upholding
**i**]{.mark}]{.underline}nternational [**[law]{.mark}** and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations Charter. Despite
potential internal political divides, one hopes strong US support for
Ukraine will persist.

[Regular consultations between the European Parliament and]{.underline}
the [US Congress are **vital**]{.underline} in supporting the work of
the TTC, particularly in terms of policy convergence in the digital
realm. These [discussions foster **joint efforts on digital
innovation**, regulation and joint standards, offering significant
benefits to both regions]{.underline}.

Indeed, the wide range of shared interests between the US and the EU
would greatly benefit from a more robust parliamentary dimension. This
should involve Congress, the European Parliament and national
parliaments. It should focus on foreign affairs, trade, technology
regulation, artificial intelligence and other innovations. Such
collaborative efforts would increase public awareness, reinforce
democratic legitimacy and enhance oversight, improving the ability to
deliver on joint initiatives.

Standing together

While pursuing transatlantic co-operation in areas of shared interest,
in parallel the EU should foster its strategic autonomy in political,
defence, economic and trade relations. [[**Standing together** against
Russia]{.mark}'s war and supporting Ukraine]{.underline}'s victory
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly
**[[crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The EU and the US, along with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and global partners, are committed to
supporting Ukraine through humanitarian assistance, military support and
aid for economic and social recovery and reconstruction, while holding
Russia to account. Utilising initiatives such as the European defence
industry reinforcement through common procurement act (DIRPA), the Act
in Support of Ammunition Production, and the European Peace Facility is
essential to maintain support for Ukraine.

Recognising the significant contribution of the US to European security,
past and present, EU member states must respect their commitments to
defence spending. This involves significantly increasing national
investments to achieve fairer burden-sharing with the US.

Building on the third joint EU-NATO declaration, [there is a focus on
[enhancing **EU**]{.mark}-NATO [co-operation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Areas
of collaboration [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}clude resilience, [[protection
of **c**]{.mark}ritical **[i]{.mark}**nfrastructure, [emerging and
disruptive **tech**]{.mark}nologies, **[space]{.mark}**, the security
implications of climate change, the [fight against]{.mark} maritime
[**piracy** and]{.mark} combating foreign **[manipulation of
info]{.mark}**rmation]{.underline} and interference.

The [EU Strategic Compass]{.underline} adopted in March 2022
[underscores]{.underline} the [importance of
**partnerships**]{.underline}, with a special focus on the US and NATO.
Ensuring complementarity with the NATO Strategic Concept is however also
crucial. This involves deepening co-operation particularly [in military
mobility, **cybersecurity**, defence research]{.underline}, dual-use
infrastructure, resilience [and inclusive joint exercises]{.underline}.

[NATO continues to be the **cornerstone** of **collective
defence**]{.underline} for its members and a guarantor of transatlantic
security. This was emphasised by the EU and the US conducting their
first joint naval exercise in March, showcasing their combined military
capabilities and commitment to regional stability.

The US European Deterrence Initiative plays a pivotal role in boosting
the military readiness of European allies and deterring Russian
aggression. Since 2015, the US has invested over \$35 billion to support
US troop deployments in Europe and assist in capability development and
readiness, reflecting the enduring commitment to European security.

Meanwhile, [China's growing]{.underline} economic and military [presence
in the Mediterranean and African countries poses **new strategic
challenges**. This]{.underline} expansion [necessitates a nuanced
approach to the region's]{.underline} geopolitical
[dynamics]{.underline}.

Spectrum of threats

**[[Transatlantic dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}** and parliamentary
diplomacy [[are critical in addressing]{.underline}]{.mark} a spectrum
of [[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} and urgent challenges. These range
[[from]{.mark} climate change and **[authoritarian]{.mark}** and
totalitarian [regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}---including in Europe and
Asia---[to]{.underline} the concerning [situation in [the **middle
east**]{.mark}, global **[criminal networks]{.mark}**, and **[gender
inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline} and discrimination. Transatlantic
dialogue aims to build bipartisan relations that will further
consolidate the relationship. [It seeks to bridge]{.underline} the
increasing [divides between **urban and rural areas** and to champion
digital]{.underline} and green [transformation for sustainable
modernisation]{.underline}.

[[New **tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [such as [**AI**,
**space**]{.mark} capabilities and **[quantum]{.mark} computing**
present]{.underline} unprecedented opportunities and
[challenges]{.underline} in defence and foreign policy. [These
[necessitate]{.mark}]{.underline} a clear strategy and [[consensus among
EU]{.underline}]{.mark} member states [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[US]{.mark} to harness their potential while **mitigating
risks**]{.underline}, ensuring that the technologies are developed and
used responsibly for the benefit of mankind.

[Strengthening the]{.underline} transatlantic [[partnership is crucial
to]{.underline}]{.mark} support **[democracy]{.underline}**, fundamental
[freedoms, human rights, gender equality, the **[rule of law]{.mark}**,
the rules-based international order [and
**multilateralism**]{.mark}]{.underline}---particularly [in response to
growing authoritarianism]{.underline} around the world. This includes
implementing the recent commitment to increase funding to the Erasmus+
programme and to double EU support for the Fulbright-Schuman program,
fostering exchanges between US and European students and researchers.

Together with our partners in the US, [it is important to demonstrate
through **concrete actions** that democracy can deliver **significant
results** for individuals and societies globally and is capable of
resisting autocratic pressure]{.underline} and influence, as well as
other serious emerging threats. We strive to reinforce the democratic
structures that have ensured prosperity and stability for decades on
both sides of the Atlantic and globally. Developing effective solutions
to global problems that affect our political, social and economic
systems is key to this endeavour.

There is a need to reinforce the accountability and resilience of our
democratic systems, especially in the run-up to the elections next
year in both regions---particularly in light of recent attempts to
meddle in electoral processes. [[Enhancing]{.mark} transatlantic
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline} and co-operation [on policies that
support **democracy**]{.underline}, human rights and the rule of law and
combat corruption and foreign interference from authoritarian regimes
[[is crucial]{.mark}. This includes [addressing]{.mark}]{.underline}
electoral interference, disinformation and
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and political
**[[coercion]{.underline}]{.mark}**---as well as advocating our values
globally.

Service; The German Marshall Funds, "Advancing US Interests in
Greenland,"
https://www.gmfus.org/news/advancing-us-interests-greenland\] lucao

President-elect Donald Trump's recent claim that US "ownership and
control of Greenland is an absolute necessity" for national and economic
security, alongside his refusal to rule out using "military or economic
coercion" to acquire the world's largest island, has sparked sharp
reactions and widespread controversy on both sides of the Atlantic.
[[Greenland\'s **p**]{.mark}rime **[m]{.mark}**inister]{.underline},
Mute Egede, quickly [[**rejected** Trump\'s
remarks]{.underline}]{.mark}, asserting that
"**[Greenland]{.underline}** is ours. We are not for sale and will never
be for sale. We must not lose our long [struggle for
**freedom**]{.underline}." Reflecting the broader threat to
transatlantic relations posed by the threat of military force,
[[**France** and **Germany** stepped]{.mark} forward [to
affirm]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**Europe** would not "let other
nations]{.underline}]{.mark} of the world [[attack]{.mark} its
**[sovereign borders]{.mark}**]{.underline}". German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz pointedly added that "the principle of the inviolability of
borders applies to every country."

Trump's comments, which came during a long and rambling news conference,
fueled days of discussion about whether they represented a serious
reflection of the incoming administration's intentions. The
[**suggestion** that the **U**nited **S**tates might be willing to use
**force** against]{.underline} a [**NATO** ally had been
**unprecedented**]{.underline} and unimaginable in the 75-year history
of the alliance. With congressional Republicans unwilling to challenge
the president-elect's expansionist tendencies, and some, such as Sen.
Lindsay Graham, climbing aboard the expansionist bandwagon, it is
already clear that Trump will face few constraints from his own party,
even on his more bizarre and farcical ideas. Consequently, US
**[allies]{.underline}** and partners [understand that they cannot
simply **ignore**]{.underline} seemingly [untethered ideas]{.underline}
and statements, even if they are likely intended primarily to divert
media attention from the economic challenges that Trump pledged to
remedy but has so far offered few ideas to address.

Lost in the frenzied reaction at home and abroad to Trump's comments is
the issue of broader US interests in a rapidly changing Arctic and the
best ways for Washington to advance those interests. Trump is correct
that [Greenland]{.underline} has been and [remains vital to American
national security and]{.underline} will be increasingly [important
economically as climate change opens]{.underline} the
**[Arctic]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} expanded [global
**shipping**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, a bullying, [[**bombastic**
approach]{.mark} is]{.underline} more [likely to [**harm** US
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} than advance them.

These interests, as articulated in the National Strategy for the Arctic
Region, are clear and straightforward: "The [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [seeks an Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} region [that
is **[peaceful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, stable, prosperous, and
cooperative." The strategy calls for ensuring US security and defense,
mitigating and building resilience to climate change, [[expanding
**econ**]{.mark}omic **opportunities**]{.underline}, protecting and
improving livelihoods for the 4 million people of the far north, [[and
reinforcing **i**]{.mark}nternational **[law]{.mark}**]{.underline},
rules, norms, and standards across Arctic countries. It recognizes that
achieving these goals [requires **US leadership**]{.underline}.

[Greenland]{.underline} has been of great security interest to the
United States since World War II, when access to the island [allowed
American forces to **thwart**]{.underline} Nazi Germany's [control of
**vital** air and sea lanes]{.underline}. In 1941, Greenland became a de
facto American protectorate, and US-provided provisions and humanitarian
aid fostered enduring goodwill between the largely Inuit Greenlandic
people and the United States. Greenland's strategic significance
continued during the Cold War, reflected in US reluctance to leave the
island as initially requested by Denmark, and Washington's subsequent
offer to purchase the territory for \$100 million. Denmark rejected the
offer but, recognizing Greenland's strategic significance, abandoned
neutrality, joined NATO, and signed a defense treaty in April 1951 that
established US "defense areas", under the alliance's umbrella, to
strengthen collective defense. Thule Air Base (now the Pituffik Space
Base) was built in 1953, boosting NATO's ability to track Soviet
submarines in the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) gap and to
enhance satellite and missile defense capabilities. The heightened
threat environment since [Russia's invasions of
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the increasing accessibility of
the Arctic Sea have [only **[reinforced]{.mark}** Greenland's [strategic
value]{.mark} to the **U**nited **S**tates and **NATO**]{.underline}.

Climate change and the [resulting [demand for]{.mark}]{.underline}
essential and [**[r]{.mark}**are **[e]{.mark}**arth
**[m]{.mark}**ineral**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} has also [[generated
**interest**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Greenland's
**potential**]{.underline} as a supplier [of key elements such as
**lithium**]{.underline}, **[niobium]{.underline}**, [and
**zirconium**.]{.underline} All are [needed for the **green
economy**]{.underline} [and **defense**]{.underline} production. The
United States and the EU have signed framework mining agreements with
Greenland, and China (which already controls most global mineral supply
chains and processing capacity) has expressed interest in a similar
arrangement. Still, potential mining projects face steep environmental,
technological, and political hurdles. An Australian-led project with
some Chinese funding was shut down in 2021 by stringent new Greenlandic
environmental regulations. Climate-linked transformations will impact
the island's economy, challenging traditional livelihoods and creating
new economic opportunities, but it will likely be many years until
Greenland emerges as a significant source of essential minerals.

Beyond security and economic interests, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} continues to [have an enduring
**interest** in [ensuring **international
coop**]{.mark}eration]{.underline} and governance [in the Arctic
[through the **Arctic Council**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in [upholding
**i**nternational **law**]{.underline}, rules, norms, and standards in
the region. [[Should those laws]{.underline}]{.mark} and norms [[be
abandoned]{.underline}]{.mark}, chaos and
[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark} there could [[open the door to
**non-Arctic** nations]{.underline}]{.mark}, most importantly China,
which has been a permanent observer to the Arctic Council since 2013 and
[[seeks to **exploit**]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} to]{.underline} its
[**econ**omic and **security advantage**]{.underline}.

What's the Problem?

Given these core interests, [Trump's recent statements beg **two
questions**]{.underline}: [Are US security]{.underline}, economic, and
political interests [under **threat** and]{.underline}, if so, [what
would be the **[best strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} to secure those
interests. While he called ownership and control of Greenland necessary,
he did not articulate any actual shortcoming in current US security
cooperation with Denmark and Greenland. Moreover, [no **major** American
efforts have yet been made [to **invest** in mineral extraction in
**Greenland**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There is no doubt that Chinese and Russian activities and increasing
cooperation in the far north pose potential risks, as the US Department
of Defense's 2024 Arctic Strategy highlights. However, when Greenland
put out to bid three airport expansion projects in 2019 and a Chinese
company actively pursued the contract, the United States was able to
work with Denmark to support a more attractive Danish proposal, which
was ultimately accepted by Greenland. That kept the Chinese at bay.
China's presence on the island remains limited, and the Greenlandic
people do not currently regard China as a desirable investment partner.

Defense cooperation among the United States, Denmark, and Greenland
remains close. There is no indication that the existing defense
agreement is inadequate, or that any emerging issues could not be
addressed through regular diplomatic and security cooperation. "If
\[the\] agreement is inadequate, I'd like to know why and where it has
fallen short, because it's not been a problem," noted Dan Fried, former
National Security Council director for Europe, adding that
"[[**Denmark** has been a serious **contributor** to]{.mark} common
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}." In the absence of any shortcoming in US
relations with [Greenland and Denmark]{.underline}, and given their
active [engagement in **NATO** to deter potential]{.underline} security
[threats]{.underline} in the far north, it is unclear why Greenland has
become the target of presidential-level threats and bullying. American
diplomatic engagement is more than capable of managing any challenge
that may emerge with its traditionally close Danish and Greenlandic
partners.

[[Unprovoked]{.mark} verbal or military
**[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [would
[undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**U**nited **S**tates' [ability to
advanc]{.mark}e its **[interests]{.mark}** in]{.underline} a peaceful,
stable, prosperous, and cooperative **[Arctic]{.underline}**. A United
States that is seen as an unreliable and even hostile partner serves
only to [[make]{.mark} China, Russia, and other American [antagonists
appear]{.mark} more **[attractive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether as
investors, traders, or security partners. Similarly, [if the **U**nited
**S**tates abandons its leadership in maintaining]{.underline} an
[Arctic]{.underline} where international law, rules, and norms are
upheld, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[**[undermine]{.mark}**s]{.underline} laws and rules, such as the
[**[sovereignty]{.mark}** of nations]{.underline} and inviolability of
borders, [it [would be a **gift** to]{.mark} Russia]{.underline},
[China]{.underline}, [and others [who seek to undermine]{.mark} such
**[norms]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the **[stability]{.underline}** they
create in the far north and worldwide. That would be [[a significant
**setback** for US interests]{.mark} in the Arctic and well
**[beyond]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The reality, as the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region makes
clear, is that "[the [**Arctic** is home to]{.mark} some of the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates[' closest]{.mark} allies and
[partners]{.mark}]{.underline}": Canada, Denmark (including Greenland),
Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. These allies are [already
[enhancing **joint capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [expanding
**[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}, [[and improving]{.mark}
interoperability and
**[info]{.mark}**rmation-**[sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Threats
to]{.mark} Arctic **[security]{.mark}** and US interests]{.underline}
from Russia or China that may emerge would be much more
[[efficiently]{.underline}]{.mark} and cost-effectively [[**addressed**
by working with]{.underline}]{.mark} these [NATO
**[partners]{.mark}**]{.underline} than by acting alone. Much more needs
to be done to protect Western interests, including expanding allied
icebreaker fleets (which the ICE Pact among the United States, Canada,
and Finland seeks to do), enhancing situational awareness and
communications, establishing a more robust regional presence, and
augmenting military exercise capabilities. But [much **more** will be
done if the **U**nited **S**tates and its allies work
**together**]{.underline}.

Ultimately, [Trump's]{.underline} renewed bombast about buying or
seizing Greenland is another example of his long-standing [**refusal**
to acknowledge]{.underline} the extent to which [the **U**nited
**S**tates benefits from]{.underline} having [allies]{.underline} and
partners that share burdens, bring regional knowledge and capabilities
to resolve problems, and are willing to work together to
[meet]{.underline} evolving [threats and **challenges**]{.underline}.
Rather than imagining problems that do not exist and proposing actions
that would make things worse, the [**[incoming admin]{.mark}**istration
[would do well to build]{.mark} on]{.underline} the [close **bilateral
[relationships]{.mark}** and NATO **partnerships**]{.underline} that the
United States enjoys [[to ensure future]{.mark} Arctic

Deterrence, Reassurance and Strategic Stability: The Enduring Relevance
of Johan Jørgen Holst examines the intellectual origins and Cold War
practice of [[Norway's balancing of **deterrence** and
**reassurance**]{.mark} of]{.underline} the [Soviet]{.underline} Union,
which [was designed to deal with asymmetric **deterrence**
challenges]{.underline} and mitigate the security dilemma. Bordering a
militarily far stronger state and reliant on a relatively distant
superpower for its security, [Norway's **[strategic
position]{.mark}**]{.underline} since at least the end of the Second
World War has been defined by asymmetry. Norway could not ensure its
security by establishing a military that matched the Soviet units
deployed near its borders, nor -- primarily for domestic political
reasons -- did it want to [[host American and]{.mark} other
[allied]{.mark} **nuclear** and **conventional**
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline} necessary [to achieve a **stable
balance**]{.underline}. While imbued in the new US nuclear-strategic
studies literature of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Holst found
strategic stability a poor fit for the Norwegian reality, instead
developing a security concept that better served Norwegian needs.

Holst defined the [**primary** aim]{.underline} of Norwegian security
policy [as maintaining a **balance**]{.underline} between deterrence of
the Soviet Union through membership of NATO and reassurance of Moscow
that Norway would not become a base for a NATO strike on the USSR. Under
this conception, [Norway's ability to [build up **NATO**]{.mark}
forces]{.underline} on its territory rapidly in a time of crisis or war
[would act as a **deterrent**]{.underline} to Soviet offensive action.
[At the same time]{.underline}, [[**Moscow** could be reassured]{.mark}
by established **pledges** [that Norway would not]{.mark} host
**nuc**lear weapon**s** or [permanently station]{.mark}]{.underline}
allied [**conventional** [forces]{.mark}]{.underline} on its territory
[[in **peacetime**]{.underline}]{.mark}. These measures, combined with
restrictions on exercises, flights and naval activity near the Soviet
border, constituted Norway's policy of reassurance toward the Soviet
Union. By pledging that these measures would remain in place if the
threat to Norway did not increase, reassurance was contingent on
Moscow's conduct, thus adding a further motive for Moscow's restraint.

While implementation of the policy was sometimes difficult, Holst's
[balance of **deterrence** and **reassurance** gave Norway the
conceptual framework necessary to navigate the **Cold
War**]{.underline}. The deterrence-reassurance pairing was most
effective when the [**Norwegian gov**ernment used reassurance to
mitigate domestic **political opposition** to enhanced **deterrence**
measures]{.underline}, such as NATO's 1979 dual-track decision on
intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) and the 1981 Norway--US
agreement to pre-stock US Marine Corps equipment in Norway. The policy
was least effective when the Norwegian government pursued reassurance
measures without coordination with its NATO allies, such as its support
for a Nordic nuclear weapon-free zone (NWFZ), which did not contain a
significant deterrence component.7 The [[importance of **Alliance**
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark} and the incorporation of reassurance
measures into an overarching deterrence package [[should be **borne** in
mind]{.mark} by]{.underline} Norwegian and other [**NATO** policymakers
considering any future **reassurance** initiatives vs.
**Moscow**]{.underline}.

The evolution and flexibility of Norwegian deterrence and reassurance

The dual 'dual' policy: two 'deterrence and reassurance' dyads in
Norwegian security policy and analyses demonstrates how this Norwegian
conceptual pairing of deterrence and reassurance has proved flexible and
durable, encompassing two distinct 'balancing acts'. When the concept
originated during the Cold War, it referred primarily to a policy of
'calibrated deterrence', particularly reflected in how the deterrent
effect of Norway's NATO membership was moderated by unilateral limits on
allied conventional and nuclear forces on its territory in peacetime.
Towards the end of the Cold War, however, the dyad has also been used to
describe a broader 'balancing act', between two theoretically
conflicting ways to security: calibrated deterrence versus reassurance
understood as an aim for détente and 'common security'. In the post-Cold
War world, the reassurance dimension of Norway's policy towards Russia
became more dominant and more ambitious -- from acting as a moderator of
deterrence to an attempt to change the basis of the relationship to one
founded on mutually beneficial cooperation across policy domains. Based
on the assumptions of liberal internationalist thought, reassurance
through transformation became a parallel track of Norwegian policy,
operating somewhat independently of the traditional realist and
security- focused deterrence-reassurance dyad.8

After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and particularly in the wake
of its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the ambition of transforming
the Norway-- Russia relationship through cooperation seems to be over --
for now. As NATO-- Russia relations sink to new post-Cold War lows,
there is a danger that the calibration of deterrence achieved during the
Cold War era will be jettisoned along with the latter, more ambitious,
agenda. A clearer distinction between these two different reassurance
policies makes it possible to sustain the debate on a policy of
calibrated deterrence, even as the hope of full transformation of the
NATO--Russia relationship has been diminished.

Deterrence and reassurance in the face of new challenges

In an evolving geopolitical landscape, deterrence and reassurance
strategies must evolve to address new technological and political
shifts. The [[**Nordic** nations]{.mark} have historically [adopted
**diverse** approaches to]{.mark} their [**security strategies** in
reaction to]{.mark} neighbouring [Russia's]{.mark} mix of
[**conventional** and **nuclear** deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
varied approaches are evident in how Russia has historically sought to
influence these countries, consistently advocating for reduced
deterrence actions and NATO presence. Russia has consistently argued
that a more significant NATO and U.S. presence undermines the security
of the Nordic region.9

[**NATO**'s deterrence posture has [prompted Russia to]{.mark} seek
**alternative**]{.underline}, sub- threshold methods of influence to
reach its objectives [while **[avoid]{.mark}**ing
**[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This approach is part of a larger
Russian strategy that blends non-military (political, economic,
ideological and so on) and military methods, including nuclear options.
These non-military tactics are crucial in Russian warfare theory, aiming
to obscure the lines between war and peace. Consequently, Russia's
information campaigns employ an integrated approach, utilizing
non-military, military and nuclear strategies to exert psychological
pressure. This paper underscores the necessity of broadening our
understanding of coercion and more closely integrate non-military
methods. While not new, this perspective requires reassessment in
today's complex, interconnected environment, where [powers like Russia
use **asymmetric tactics** to exploit grey zones]{.underline},
especially [under conditions of **nuclear parity**]{.underline} and
fluctuating conventional power dynamics.

#### Arctic instability goes [nuclear]{.underline}\-\--recommitment to Greenland secures [strategic basing]{.underline} that otherwise inflames [conflict]{.underline} and fails [European arms control]{.underline}.

Long gone are the days of "duck and cover" drills and fallout shelters
in America, when the fears of nuclear war were on the minds of most.
[For **decades**]{.underline}, cooler heads prevailed, and [the U.S. and
Russia worked **cooperatively** to reduce the risk of
**[nuclear]{.mark}** conflict and decrease the size of]{.underline}
their **[arsenals]{.underline}**. By 2022, [[cooperation began
**disintegrating**]{.mark} as]{.underline} Russia's botched [invasion of
[**Ukraine** raised]{.mark} serious [concerns about]{.mark} **nuclear
[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and severely hampered the prospects
of future nuclear arms control agreements. With Russia seemingly
dismissing the Trump administration's rather conciliatory efforts to end
the war, there appears to be no end in sight, and Europe is feeling the
pressure, embarking on a massive effort to boost its own defense.

Amidst these tensions, [[melting **polar ice**]{.mark} is opening Arctic
sea lanes to [increased shipping **traffic**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**resource** [exploration]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and **military
posturing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO's newest members, Finland and
Sweden, are Arctic nations. **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** currently
dominates the Arctic region, holding 53% of its total coastline,
operating the world's biggest icebreaker fleet, and [has been
[upgrading]{.mark} its Arctic **military [bases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** is also [[increasingly]{.mark} playing
a role]{.underline}, [conducting joint **Arctic** [military
**exercises**]{.mark}]{.underline} with Russia and employing an
icebreaker fleet of its own, despite its complete lack of territory in
the Arctic Circle.

But is the [[**Arctic** destined to be the **most likely** flashpoint
for a **nuclear war**]{.underline}]{.mark}? Let's look at the
possibilities.

Despite being so cold, [the Arctic is **no stranger** to military
conflict]{.underline}, [holding major **strategic value**]{.underline}
and [serving as a **passageway** to]{.underline} both [the Atlantic and
Pacific]{.underline}. During World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic
extended into the Arctic and ships carrying American war supplies to the
Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea Route. Germany invaded Norway,
and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War of 1940. As the
Cold War evolved, the Arctic became [a major theater for **sub**marine
activity]{.underline}.

Today, President [[**Trump's** insistence on acquiring
**Greenland**]{.underline}]{.mark} "one way or the other" highlights the
growing importance of the Arctic to the security interests of the United
States. [Greenland's geographic location]{.underline}, [[combined
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S.' operation of [**[Pituffik]{.mark}**
Space Base in the high north]{.underline}, [[provides
key]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[missile warning]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[missile defense]{.underline}**, [and **space
surveillance**]{.underline}" [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
shortest flight paths for nuclear missiles between the U.S. and Russia
exist over the Arctic Ocean, and [the [loss of this base]{.mark} on
account of a **diplomatic blunder** could [open a key blind spot in
America's **strategic defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Alternatively, the
loss of this base to a Russian attack aimed at disabling American
missile detection infrastructure is unlikely due to the danger of
immediate retaliation and escalation.

Currently, the [[most **likely** path to]{.mark} a potential **[nuclear
exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Arctic [[would be through]{.mark}
a conventional or]{.underline} "**[[gray zone]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[Russian [attack]{.mark} on a NATO member]{.underline}. [**Border**
skirmishes]{.underline}, **[cyber-attacks]{.underline}**, [**airspace**
incursions]{.underline}, [reckless **military intercepts**]{.underline},
[and support to **separatist** groups]{.underline} intentionally sit in
the "gray zone" between peace and outright war, but [could
ultimately]{.underline} lead to open conflict that [escalates to
**nuclear** war]{.underline}. Conceivably, a [gray zone or [overt attack
on]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[**Greelandic**
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, or an information operations
campaign [aimed at dividing the **U.S.**]{.underline},
**[Greenland]{.underline}**, [and **Denmark**]{.underline}, [[are not
outside of the realm of possibility]{.underline}]{.mark}.

With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly,
**[Finland]{.underline}**---which shares a 1,343 km border with
Russia---there is [increased opportunity that a **NATO** Arctic state
could be **attacked**]{.underline}. Highlighting this risk, American
forces in Alaska recently staged a drill in which hundreds of troops
were flown to Finland to defend against a mock Russian invasion. Yet
rather than an overt invasion of a NATO member, Russia is far more
likely test the waters by conducting provocative and destabilizing
small-scale gray zone activities. The disastrous results of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about its
ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear armed
country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct attack unlikely.
It is [not entirely clear where the red line on **gray zone**
activities]{.underline} would be for Finland or what [would
[trigger]{.mark} an **[A]{.mark}**rticle **[5]{.mark}**]{.underline}
collective defense [declaration]{.underline} short of a direct attack
across the border.

[[Though]{.underline}]{.mark} the threat of [[American
**nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** has [long-served to
deter]{.mark} a Russian attack]{.underline} on the European NATO
members, President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} many [public
[**pronouncements** expressing doubt about]{.mark} his [**willingness**
to defend]{.mark} a **[NATO]{.mark}** member]{.underline} that comes
under attack has shaken confidence in Europe about America's commitment.
As a result, [[**France** and the **UK** are considering
expanding]{.mark} their **[arsenals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [signifying
an increased reliance on **nuclear posturing**]{.underline} for
deterrence, including for the defense of Arctic NATO members.
[**France** is reconsidering]{.underline} whether it wants to
decommission its current warheads as it brings
**[replacements]{.underline}** online, potentially doubling of the size
of its arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an airbase closer to the
German border to be able to host nuclear weapons. [The
**UK**]{.underline}, which has been historically dependent on the U.S.
for its nuclear arsenal, [is recently questioning that
**dependence**]{.underline}, and may seek other options to assure an
effective and reliable deterrent. [This could [**foretell** a new
nuclear **arms race**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [**[upcoming]{.mark}** February 2026 [expiration of **New
START**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the last remaining]{.underline} strategic
[nuclear arms treaty]{.underline} between the U.S. and Russia, portends
a period of nuclear proliferation that [could [echo]{.mark} the nuclear
arms **buildups** of t[he Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has been operating in the
Arctic, [has been [engaging in its own **rapid**]{.mark} nuclear
[buildup]{.mark}]{.underline} in an effort to potentially exceed 1,000
warheads by 2035. China has [**consistently** rejected efforts to join a
**multilateral** nuclear arms reduction **treaty**]{.underline} with the
U.S. and Russia, citing its comparatively much smaller nuclear arsenal.

[[**Navigation** issues]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic could also
[[lead to]{.mark} **military [escalations]{.mark}** [reaching]{.mark}
the [nuclear]{.mark} level]{.underline}. The [**G**lobal **N**avigation
**S**atellite **S**ystem]{.underline} (GNSS), which includes satellite
constellations like the American GPS system or Russian GLONASS, [sees
[decreased reliability and accuracy]{.mark} in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. The reasons for this are abundant, like the
orbital inclination of the satellites themselves and ionospheric
interference. With [[increased **incidents** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
Russian GNSS **[[jamming]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Europe, it's
conceivable that Russia may employ similar tactics in the Arctic,
[including **[spoofing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for the purpose of
disruption or causing navigational errors to [[trigger an
**exploitable**]{.mark} international [incident]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Military or civilian vessels straying into Russian territory could be
captured, their cargoes seized, or crews held hostage for the purpose of
conducting hostage diplomacy. [Resolving such a **confrontation**
military could [quickly **spiral** out of control]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A5: The impact of a [[**shift** in Europe's **nuclear
posture**]{.underline}]{.mark} on the nonproliferation architecture will
depend on the nature of the change. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (**[NPT]{.underline}**), which [**prohibits** new
countries from developing **nuc**lear weapon**s** and is the
**foundation** of the global nuclear **order**]{.underline}, does not
explicitly address NATO nuclear sharing, but the practice remains a
point of debate. NATO members argue that nuclear sharing does not
violate the NPT because the weapons remain under U.S. control in
peacetime. They also contend that the practice was established before
the treaty's entry into force in 1970 and was explicitly taken into
account and acknowledged during negotiations.

In an extreme scenario, such as stationing [[**French** or **British
nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Germany, [[the
limits of the **NPT** would be **stretched**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While
Germany would not receive direct control over the warheads, critics
would argue that such a move violates the treaty---in spirit or even its
articles more explicitly. Indeed, it [would constitute a [**new**
nuclear sharing arrangement]{.mark} that was **not provided** for in the
**NPT**]{.underline} and it could [[even be at **odds** with]{.mark}
France and the United Kingdom's [obligations regarding
**disarmament**]{.mark}]{.underline} if this new configuration required
increasing the size of their nuclear arsenals. Russia recently tested
these boundaries by deploying nuclear weapons to Belarus, sparking
debate over the implications for the treaty.

Less drastic shifts, such as stationing French nuclear-armed aircraft in
Germany or other European allies who would express their interest, might
not directly challenge the nonproliferation regime but would likely feed
criticisms, particularly amongst nonnuclear weapon States in the Global
South, where double standards in the West's approach to nuclear issues
are prevalent. Moreover, with Russia openly defying international law
and China criticizing U.S. nuclear extended deterrence in the
Indo-Pacific, any change in Europe's nuclear posture could augment
strategic risks in an already tense geopolitical environment.

Integration with Greenland and a New American Arctic Century,\"

"Look at a globe from the top," Eric Teetsel wrote recently. "What you
will see is the North Pole with Alaska, Canada, and Greenland flanking
one side and Russia flanking the other until you reach Scandinavia. The
Arctic is the frontline of great power competition among the United
States, Russia, and China." Greenland's importance to the United States
is not a new debate or simply a question of strategy or economy, even
though the discussion of its usefulness recently gathered momentum after
President Trump expressed renewed interest in the country.

Americans such as Charles Francis Hall and Robert Perry explored
Greenland during the 1870s, providing valuable research and documenting
the demographics of the landmass. Repeated interest in acquiring
Greenland was demonstrated by Secretary of State William Seward and U.S.
Ambassador to Denmark Maurice Egan in 1867. The US was also interested
in outright buying Greenland in 1910. Immediately after the Second World
War, in 1946, Denmark rebuffed Secretary of State James Byrnes's offer
to acquire the island but offered basing rights instead. Buying
territory from Denmark is not new, either: In 1915, Denmark was coerced
to give away the Danish West Indies, which we now know as the U.S.
Virgin Islands.

[[Greenland's]{.mark} current [leadership wants to **enhance its ties**
with the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. In a recent conversation,
[Greenland's [minister of business advocated for investment]{.mark} from
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates: "There are ample
opportunities for American investors to engage themselves in Greenland,
not only in the mining sector, but in other sectors as well. Especially
[the mining sector could be [beneficial to **securing supply
chains**]{.mark} to the U.S.]{.underline}, since we do have many of the
minerals on your list of critical minerals. These could be graphite,
nickel, rare earths, or others. Our existing agreement with the U.S.
State Department is from 2019 under the first Trump administration. [We
have]{.underline} for some time [been hoping for a new
agreement]{.underline}."

This policy brief offers a pathway towards further integration between
Greenland and the United States. It does not deal with inherent
political questions of whether the United States should acquire
Greenland, whether the proposed integration is feasible in the short
term, or in what scenario that result might be achieved.

Rather, this policy brief is predicated on the assumption that further
integration between the United States and Greenland is necessary and
inevitable because of the structural realities of European dysfunction
and emerging multipolarity and great power competition in the Arctic.

Accordingly, this policy brief is divided into two parts. The first part
explains the strategic reasoning for involvement in Greenland and
elaborates its current political position. It also details a brief
history of the United States' recent engagement in Greenland in
minerals, mining, and defense. The second part provides the current
strategic layout and a few concrete policy suggestions as necessary
first steps towards future integration, which could become one of
President Trump's foreign policy legacies.

"Not Confined to Materialistic Considerations": Greenland's Strategic
Importance

American interest in directly acquiring Greenland started around 1868,
and the last pre-Trump effort was in 1946. Of all the historic documents
available, Seward's commissioned report from 1868 best explains the
reasoning: "In considering the future of Greenland, we cannot confine
ourselves entirely to materialistic considerations. Nations have other
resources besides those which figures can express to us by statistical
tables. If a country has in it the means of developing man in any way,
physically or mentally, it may be said to be rich to that extent. . . .
They possess, as it were, the key to many problems of science, and the
answer to many questions which are at present discussed by geographers.
Certainly, new truths are as precious acquisitions as new mines or new
fishing grounds."

It is not within the scope of this brief to chart the entire history of
American interest in Greenland, but there is ample evidence, as
demonstrated below, that it has received unique attention and is
important enough for continuous strategic discussion. Notably, the
American envoy to Denmark Maurice Egan wrote to Secretary of State
Philander Knox in 1909, "I do not presume for a moment to forestall in
any way the intentions of the United States Government concerning these
islands, but as I think the opportunity of acquiring them may some day
arise, I feel it my duty, unless I am otherwise directed by you, to pave
the way gently as far as possible toward that acquirement." In 1946, a
classified State Department memo was reported to have said, according to
the joint chiefs of staff, that the real objective regarding Greenland
was "to acquire it by purchase from Denmark."

Greenland lies within the Western Hemisphere and is functionally "a
north American island nation," yet it is a constituent of a north
European allied nation state. To summarize the history, Greenland was
connected to the Kingdom of Denmark and Norway around the 1720s, when
north European missionaries started to settle in Greenland and native
Greenlanders were Christianized and the island became a part of European
trade routes. The Nazi occupation of Denmark meant that the colonial
government of Greenland had to be self-sufficient. The first formal
agreement between the United States and Greenland was initiated in 1941;
it allowed the United States to establish a permanent military base in
Greenland in exchange for protection of Danish colonial administration,
based in Greenland, from the ongoing Nazi invasion in Europe.

The U.S.--Greenland treaty was against the wishes of the government in
Nazi-occupied Denmark. After the war, the free Danish government sought
to end the treaty but was unable to do so because the treaty allowed
American presence in perpetuity, and American protection became a given
after Denmark joined NATO in 1949. A new defense agreement in 1951
consolidated Greenland's position as a core American interest and part
of its sphere of influence. Greenland voted against joining the European
Community (later the European Union) in 1972, even after Denmark voted
to join it. Finally, after the introduction of "home rule" in Greenland,
Greenland voted to withdraw from the European Union in 1985.

An American Northstar

[[Greenland is]{.mark} **phenomenally [rich]{.mark}** [in "critical
minerals"]{.mark} such as cerium and lanthanum]{.underline}, which are
[essential for iPhones, drones, **a**]{.underline}rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, [electric cars, MRI machines, space
exploration, and nuclear power]{.underline}. The Economist reported in
2024 that [[the island has]{.underline}]{.mark} known [[deposits of **43
of 50**]{.mark} of]{.underline} the [[minerals]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[the]{.underline} U.S. [[Department of Energy considers
essential]{.underline}]{.mark} for "technologies that produce, transmit,
store, and conserve energy" [[and]{.mark} are [within]{.mark} "a [high
risk of supply chain disruption]{.mark},"]{.underline} including 25 of
the 34 minerals deemed critical raw material by the European Union.
Greenland also has large deposits of other elements such as lithium and
cobalt.

The BBC reported that [[Greenland has]{.mark} the [potential to become,
under proper]{.mark}]{.underline} strategic guidance and
[**[investment]{.mark}**, "the [supplier of **all** the minerals]{.mark}
the [Western world will need]{.mark} for decades."]{.underline}
Greenland is reported to be home to a quarter of the globe's
undiscovered hydrocarbon resources and around a tenth of the world's
coal and critical materials, including iron, zinc, and even uranium. The
2024 Arctic Strategy from the Department of Defense declares that the
United States is an Arctic nation and that the
Greenland--Iceland--United Kingdom (GIUK) Gap is a venue for strategic
competition. This view is shared by the [**[Russia]{.mark}**n strategic
community]{.underline}, which [[understands]{.underline}]{.mark} that a
U.S.-controlled Greenland would be a defeat for other great powers in
the Arctic because [[Greenland's strategic value]{.mark} will only ever
**increase**]{.underline}.

President Trump's instincts about controlling both Greenland and Panama
are therefore predicated on a renewed American focus on great power
competition. Acquiring or controlling Greenland as well as regaining
control of Panama would allow the United States to manage two
significant sea routes and geographical choke points, along with
acquiring the rare earth minerals needed for the coming
techno-industrial revolution at a time of an emergent multipolarity.

Under pressure, Denmark recently pledged to invest more in the defense
of Greenland. A tranche of defense investment included a "double digit
billion amount" in krone, or at least \$1.5 billion, to buy "two new
inspection ships, two new long-range drones and two extra dog sled
teams," according to the BBC. Denmark also subsidizes Greenland with
around \$600 million a year, a fifth of Greenland's GDP, which amounts
to more than \$10,000 per Greenlander. Unfortunately, [Greenland remains
**underdeveloped**]{.underline}, a sore point of contention between its
ruling party and Denmark. This state of affairs is partly due to
Denmark's and Europe's energy priorities, which focus on solar and wind
power, and partly due to Europe's financial and technical inability to
invest the way America can.

As a result, Greenland is a massive financial strain on Denmark and a
victim of cultural ills resulting from its lack of development,
including alcoholism and abuse. Greenlanders increasingly support full
independence from Denmark with aid from the United States. "Greenlanders
feel as though they are trapped in a kind of forced marriage . . . with
Denmark playing the role of the overpowering husband", Der Spiegel
quoted political scientist Kuno Fensler. "Maybe the U.S. can liberate us
from this predicament", Fensler added.

"It is a message Donald Trump would no doubt love to hear," Der Spiegel
continued. "He seems to have had something similar in mind when he
announced his interest in buying Greenland and its 57,000 residents---a
desire he has repeated on a number of occasions."

Since 2020, Greenland's leaders have said they want to negotiate
independently with the United States. Most of that negotiation thus far
has been tripartite, among Greenland, Denmark, and the United States.
[[Greenland]{.mark} has shown]{.underline} that [it [wants to
**develop**]{.mark} and deepen trade relations
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
since]{.underline} the Igaliku [agreements of 2004 and its renewed base
maintenance contract with]{.underline} the [United States in
2020]{.underline} for the Pituffik base (formerly named Thule base; the
United States changed the name in 2023 as a gesture towards Greenland's
culture). [Greenland and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[signed two memoranda of understanding]{.mark}
in 2019 [about **raw materials**, but progress
**slowed**]{.mark}]{.underline} due to the Biden administration's lack
of interest. [In 2019, the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[funded]{.underline}** joint [overhead
**geological surveys**]{.underline} in South Greenland. Other bilateral
projects about tender allotment and dual use of strategic infrastructure
in Greenland are also under discussion, and the United States is
considering further investment.

"Plans Are Measured in Centuries": A Policy Pathway Aimed Towards a New
American Arctic Century

A peaceful acquisition of sparsely populated strategic land in the
Western Hemisphere has historical and cultural precedent in the United
States, and a return to hemispheric hegemony and theater prioritization
makes strategic sense in an era of military overstretch and
multipolarity. Greenland's central position in the Arctic route and its
history with both Denmark and the United States are crucial in
understanding why the United States must prioritize engagement with
Greenland.

[**Unnecessary** rhetoric]{.underline} and politics [aside, [the timing
for]{.mark}]{.underline} further [[engagement with]{.underline}]{.mark}
both Denmark and [[Greenland is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
**[[ripe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There are three modes of negotiation
among Denmark, Greenland, and the United States. [[**Denmark** has
been]{.underline}]{.mark} unwilling and understandably reluctant to talk
about American coercive measures but [[willing to
discuss]{.underline}]{.mark} Greenland's independence and
[[**unlimited** American mining]{.underline}]{.mark} and basing
[[rights]{.underline}]{.mark}. Greenland sees an opportunity to move out
of Denmark's shadow towards fewer regulations, political and strategic
independence, and unlimited investment from the United States. American
interest dictates not just investment and mining and basing rights but
also potentially some form of American work and settlement programs in
Greenland. Tying these disparate threads will be essential for the
success of future negotiations. [[Greenland's]{.underline}]{.mark}
recent acknowledgement of the strategic importance of the region as well
as its [**[inclination]{.mark}** towards exponentially greater American
engagement [are]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[**healthy signs**
of]{.mark} an emerging]{.underline} strategic [realism]{.underline} and
[would make [a **mutually beneficial arrangement**]{.mark}]{.underline}
among the three parties much easier to achieve.

Below are five suggestions for approaching that negotiation.

1\. [[It would be of **paramount importance** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
ignore the noise of dissent and [[lower]{.mark} the [temperature of the
debate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ultimately, [it should be kept in
mind]{.underline} that [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[already has]{.underline}]{.mark}**
basing and [[**mining rights** in Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[both [Denmark and Greenland are interested in **offering
more**]{.mark}. The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
also [has **total freedom** to invest as much as it wants]{.underline}
and to "saturate the zone," so to speak, with pro-American messaging. An
American administration should not ignore these structural advantages,
nor should it jeopardize the negotiations by involving too many pressure
points or by using too many stakeholders. [[Acquiring
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether by coaxing or coercing, is a
political question, but controlling Greenland is a perpetual American
interest that [[might be threatened by **unnecessary
hostility**]{.underline}]{.mark} from either side or too much
interference from external parties who are unfamiliar with the ground
realities or impulses of the region. [[**Cool heads** and a **prudent
approach**]{.mark}, however, [could lead to long-term
ownership]{.mark}]{.underline} and control [of the region]{.underline},
whose importance will only continue to increase.

2\. Conditional to the first point, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [should]{.underline} urgently [identify
stakeholders from civil, military, and business interests in both
Greenland and the United States and create a negotiation
spearhead]{.underline}. This effort can take various forms depending on
the president's preference. Options include advisory committees, a
presidential executive order forming a fact-finding mission board, or
private track-two delegations authorized by the president or the State
Department. Regardless of which approach is chosen, the goal should be
to create an official channel for the effort in the place of a
directionless desire to "do something." Establishing a time-bound group
of stakeholders committed to understanding Denmark and Greenland's
positions, demands, flexibilities, negotiation tactics, and red lines
would help in making a coherent plan.

[It would]{.underline} also [be beneficial to create a]{.underline}
privatized ["wealth fund": a list of business interests and investors
who would be willing to invest in Greenland]{.underline} at a moment's
notice. This fund would identify the sectors that need American
assistance the most, from shipping to supermarkets. Solving trivial
issues builds momentum towards further engagement. Greenland's business
community is determined to develop a foothold in the United States but
is hampered by a lack of a direct shipping route; the Greenlandic
seafood company Royal Greenland, for example, only recently opened a
sales office in Boston. [Identifying]{.underline} similar [opportunities
for U.S.-connected business expansion]{.underline} in order
[to]{.underline} deregulate and [open the market]{.underline} on both
sides [for engagement would tie Greenland with]{.underline} the
[American mainland]{.underline} at a much faster pace and create the
conditions for deeper relations between the countries.

3\. Greenland's strategic doctrines provide opportunities to increase
its dependency on the United States. [Greenland's own analysis
shows]{.underline} that [[Denmark's economic engagement is
**inadequate** and]{.mark} the [**mineral resources industry** accounts
for less than **1 percent** of Greenland's economy]{.mark}]{.underline},
with only about one hundred full-time employees. The industry employs a
relatively high proportion of foreign labor force. This [situation
offers an opportunity for]{.underline} a [special arrangement with
Greenland wherein American investment is coupled with]{.underline} a
periodic [American labor force]{.underline} with a special work visa
category.

Per Greenland's analysis, [there are **auxiliary** industries in
operating and dismantling exploration camps and in "transportation,
catering, logistics, plumbing, carpentry, welding, drilling, blasting,
rental and repair of machinery and equipment, waste management,
security, and analysis and consultancy work within geology, geophysics
and environment" that provide ample opportunities for
investment]{.underline}, labor exchange, and training in both the United
States and Greenland.

Industries such as hospitality, and a free market to support such
endeavors would create wealth and unparalleled development in Greenland
at a minimal and targeted cost to the American side compared to the
enormous directionless waste of assistance given by USAID. [[**No major
American efforts** have]{.mark} yet [been made to invest in **mineral
extraction** in Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[that]{.mark}
oversight **[urgently needs to be rectified]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[4. [Greenland's landmass has **never been completely mapped**]{.mark},
and mapping is [**required** for]{.mark}]{.underline} further [[mineral
exploration. The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[can create a]{.mark} strategic [task
force under]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense [[to geomap the entire
territory]{.mark} and report on industrial minerals. This]{.underline}
effort [would be]{.underline} an example of [a benevolent scientific
project that would demonstrate American benevolence towards
Greenland]{.underline} and Greenlanders.

An advisory committee or board could also be created by executive order
under the Department of Defense or Office of Management and Budget to
assess military and economic association agreements with Greenland. So
far, there are two instantly workable and advisable models. One is a
free association model similar to the United States' relationship with
the Marshall Islands or Micronesia, which allows the United States to
concentrate on unparalleled force postures in return for security and
financial guarantees. The second is a model that bestows territorial
status similar to Guam but that is dependent on Greenland's interest in
joining the arrangement. Nevertheless, an advisory committee or board,
reporting directly to the president's office, could be a regular venue
for discussion and research that would allow academics, diplomats, and
military leaders to consider various options for economic, diplomatic,
and military engagement with Greenland.

5\. An education campaign could be targeted towards Greenland's
population, similar to the ones historically aimed towards the Eastern
bloc countries with Radio Free Europe, to demonstrate the material and
strategic advantages that Greenland would gain from deeper association
with the United States, including but not limited to a significant lump
sum of potential cash benefits. More recently, as CRA has noted
elsewhere, many of these programs have been used to undermine the United
States' interests, or even to attack United States citizens;
nevertheless, the ability to apply resources and practices to the
strategic benefit of United States' interests remains necessary in some
form. [Greenland's government has repeatedly hinted at providing
education and information regarding **job opportunities** in the mineral
sector]{.underline}. The United States could help Greenland's government
to communicate the importance of the mineral resources sector, increase
dialogue with the population about the sector, and tout the
contributions of the mineral resources industry. In other words, let the
market create its own momentum.

"Iron Hand in a Velvet Glove"

The president, the vice president, and the secretary of defense recently
have given major speeches that featured three core themes: military
burden-shifting in Europe; support for a free and technologically
advanced world under an emergent multipolarity; and a new American
century, renewed Monroe Doctrine, and revived sense of manifest destiny.
Two theoretical opposing arguments to these aims are that first, [[by
being **open about territorial claims**, the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[might **alienate its allies**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and second, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [doesn't need to **acquire**
Greenland to control]{.mark} it or own [its
**minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both arguments have some merit. The
United States might be able to unilaterally annex Greenland, even
against the wishes of Denmark and Greenland itself. It would likely not
be challenged by European troops in Greenland, either, for fear of
provoking the United States by invading its sphere of influence. But
[[by using **coercion** instead of **diplomacy**, the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[could lose]{.mark} its [allies **permanently**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
And no great power can be all-powerful and alone forever.

There are also democratic debates to be had within the United States
about the cost of absorbing the financial burden of Greenland. In any
debate, however, it is undeniable that Greenland is enormously important
to both European and American security. This debate will provide an
opportunity for the United States to demonstrate that contrary to public
opinion it is still heavily invested in European security against Russia
and China. It will show that the United States is invested in winning
the technological cold war in this century. And it will demonstrate that
the United States is not isolationist. As Pat Buchanan recently wrote,
"while Trump's diplomacy in the Greenland matter was not as deft as
Seward's in acquiring Alaska, the attitude exhibited would not be
unfamiliar to many of the great men in our history." In other words, [it
is a prudent aim [to]{.mark}]{.underline} control and [[acquire
Greenland]{.mark}, but it [should be done in a **diplomatic way** that
maintains a healthy relationship with]{.mark} Denmark]{.underline} in
particular [and Western [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} in general. Those
preserving U.S. hegemony have always preferred, in the words attributed
to Cardinal Richelieu, to have an "iron hand in a velvet glove." The
north is one theater where that priority needs to be restored.

[**China's dominance** of the global rare earths supply chain **won't
dwindle easily,**]{.underline} even if Beijing decides to approve more
export licenses through deals with Europe and the U.S.

Three Shenzhen-listed Chinese companies this month said that [Beijing
approved their exports of magnets with rare earths]{.underline} ---
metals critical for cars, defense, semiconductors and other industrial
products. [But another firm]{.underline}, Baotou INST Magnetic New
Materials, said last month the [export licenses can only be used for one
shipment.]{.underline}

[In Europe]{.underline}, automotive industry groups have said that, in
the case of magnets and heavy rare earths, [**long-term** export
**licenses** from China were **only valid** for a **maximum of six
months**]{.underline}.

[**Diversifying** away from **Chinese sourcing** of rare earths is
likely to be "**extremely difficult"**]{.underline} and, at best, a
limited long-term solution, according to a Tuesday note from Rico Luman,
senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING.

[China is the **undisputed leader** of the critical **minerals supply
chain**, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply of rare earths and
processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from
other countries and refining them.]{.underline}

["Europe currently produces **no rare earths**, and the U.S. has **only
recently** begun **small-scale** production of neodymium and
praseodymium.]{.underline} However, both regions hold only a fraction of
global reserves, limiting their ability to scale up," Luman said.

Already, [European automakers and U.S. high-tech businesses in China
have **halted production** or **warned of a shortage** this
summer.]{.underline}

[China announced **export controls** on seven rare earths in early
April, following a series of **tighter restrictions** in the last two
years on a **broad range** of critical minerals.]{.underline}
[Washington had expected a rollback]{.underline} of the April controls
once the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day tariff reprieve in mid-May.
[After trade talks in London]{.underline} this week, [U.S. officials
indicated Beijing will soon allow more rare earths exports.]{.underline}

[China has approved "a certain number" of export permits]{.underline}
for rare earth elements and related items, a spokesperson for the
commerce ministry said Thursday, adding that [China will continue to
step up examination and approval for such license]{.underline}
applications.

[This has yet to significantly improve business conditions.]{.underline}

The [**market remains "volatile"** even after the U.S.-China trade
negotiations]{.underline} in London, said Philippe Kehren, CEO of
Belgian chemicals group Solvay, which operates the largest rare earths
processing plant outside of China in La Rochelle, France.

In response to that unpredictability, he said the company is using
recycled material and studying sourcing alternatives to China.

"This is how we adjust to the current, unpredictable situation and I
think the best mitigation in this type of circumstance is indeed to
master the technology," Kehren said. Solvay aims to supply 30% of
Europe's processed rare earth demand for permanent magnets by 2030.

Half-hearted rollback

[Beijing will **likely** keep up its **restrictions on rare earths** to
deter Washington from ratcheting up restrictions on high tech exports to
China]{.underline}, said Dennis Wilder, a former senior White House
intelligence official.

["If new export controls]{.underline} \[against China\] [are

The term refers to a group of 17 elements required to make tech products
ranging from semiconductors to industrial magnets and some solar panels
--- the same items embroiled in the US-China trade war.

For more than a year, [Beijing has slowly been **tightening its grip**
on critical minerals and rare earths.]{.underline}

In December, China banned the export of a range of rare earth processing
technologies. Last month, China further tightened its grip on the
sector. Citing resource protection and national security, Beijing made
it mandatory for exporters to track how rare earth minerals are used in
supply chains.

Now, there are fears that China could tighten the global rare earths
supply chain even more.

Here\'s what you need to know about rare earths, what makes them so
valuable, and how they play into the tech war between the US and China.

China\'s rare earth dominance

China has long dominated the rare earths market due to supply, low labor
costs, and lax environmental standards.

The country produces 60% of the world\'s rare earth mineral supply and
accounts for 90% of global refined output.

The late Deng Xiaoping --- the Chinese leader who spearheaded the
country\'s economic reforms in 1978 --- recognized their strategic
importance in 1992, saying, \"The Middle East has oil, China has rare
earths.\"

Under the new regulations introduced last month, China\'s rare earth
resources now belong to the state. Two Canadian-owned rare earth
refineries in China are also being acquired by state-owned companies.

This is not the first time Beijing has placed restrictions on rare
earths. In 2010, [China imposed **strict rare earth
quotas**]{.underline}, citing environmental concerns and resource
preservation. The move [**sent prices up** sharply and prompted the US,
the European Union, and Japan to **file a complaint** against China for
unfair trade practices at the **W**orld **T**rade
**O**rganization]{.underline}. China lost the case and lifted exported
quotas in 2015.

Various countries tried to diversify their rare earth supply chains in
the wake of China\'s quotas in the 2010s, but success has been limited
due to the high cost of investment and environmental concerns.

There are renewed efforts to boost global production in the face of
rising tensions.

In 2022, the US Department of Defense awarded \$45 million to MP
Materials for rare earth oxide processing, and in 2023, it awarded over
\$288 million to Lynas USA to set up commercial-scale rare earth oxide
production facilities.

How is China leveraging rare earths?

[Beijing\'s moves to **control critical minerals** and rare earths are
part of a toolbox]{.underline} Beijing has developed over the last four
years, Rick Waters, the managing director of Eurasia Group\'s China
practice, said at a press briefing.

During President Donald Trump\'s first term, the US and China slapped
retaliatory tariffs on each other. However, China has less leverage in a
tariff fight because it exports more to the US than it imports, so it
came up with another regulatory framework --- this one involving rare
earths --- that it can use in a trade dispute.

\"They\'re experimenting with its use, and I think, in a way, they could
go further --- if they perceive they need to,\" said Waters.

[Any further tightening of rare earth supplies --- which are a
**subset** under critical minerals --- could leave the US **vulnerable
to supply shocks**.]{.underline}

[\"China has **cornered the market**]{.underline} for processing and
refining of key critical minerals, leaving the US and our allies and
partners vulnerable to supply chain shocks and [undermining economic and
national **security**]{.underline},\" the White House said in a
statement in September.

Flexes Chokehold on Rare-Earth Magnets as Exports Plunged" in May
6-19-2025

-- lily

[China's exports of rare-earth magnets plummeted after it imposed
controls on their overseas sale, emphasizing Beijing's **dominance** of
a critical input into electric vehicles and jet fighters that has taken
center stage in tensions with the U.S.]{.underline}

[Total export volumes of rare-earth magnets from China fell 74% in May
from a year earlier, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of
Chinese customs data. That was the biggest percentage decline on record
dating back to at least 2012.]{.underline} Exports had fallen 45% in
April in year-over-year terms. The 1.2 million kilograms of rare-earth
magnets exported in May marked the lowest level since February 2020,
during the Covid pandemic.

Exports of rare-earth magnets to the U.S. slowed to a trickle, declining
93% in May from a year earlier to roughly 46,000 kilograms. That
followed a 59% year-over-year drop in April.

[The figures released Friday are the first to show the extent to which
Beijing's curb on rare-earth magnets further choked off supplies to the
world in May, which drew the ire of the Trump administration and brought
the two countries back to the negotiation table earlier this
month.]{.underline}

Beijing on April 4 began requiring licenses for exports of certain
rare-earth metals and related products. That included some magnets made
with rare-earth metals such as dysprosium and terbium that are essential
to making a range of goods. [The controls restrict exports to all
countries, not just the U.S., but came during one of the most heated
periods of the U.S.-China trade conflict, with the two superpowers
trading tit-for-tat tariff increases.]{.underline}

China's move to restrict rare-earth magnets was felt acutely through the
global automotive, electronics and defense industries. China has a
near-monopoly on rare earths production. It mines around two-thirds of
global rare-earth minerals and processes about 90% of the world's
supply.

[A trade truce between the U.S. and China in Geneva in mid-May in which
both sides agreed to reduce tariffs for 90 days was expected to ease the
flow of these magnets. But rare-earth exports remained constrained, and
U.S. automakers warned they could face production stoppages as a
result.]{.underline}

[The U.S. accused Beijing of slow-walking license approvals. China
blamed the Trump administration for breaking the Geneva agreement. That
brought trade representatives from the U.S. and China to London this
month to get the trade truce back on track.]{.underline}

The two countries created a framework to restore the agreement reached
in Geneva, subject to final approval from President Trump and Chinese
leader Xi Jinping. The framework is expected to ease curbs on rare-earth
exports from China, in exchange for the U.S. relaxing some restrictions
on certain exports to China.

[The deal appears to allow China to keep the export-control system for
rare earths in place, which would allow Beijing to curb supplies again
in the future. Licenses for U.S. manufacturers to import rare earths
from China would have a six-month limit, people familiar with the deal
said.]{.underline}

A spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said Thursday that China
has been accelerating its review of rare-earth export license
applications and has approved a certain number of compliant
applications, without giving specific numbers.

JL Mag Rare-Earth, a Chinese supplier of rare earth magnets for Tesla,
Bosch, General Motors and others, said in a June 13 analysts call that
it has gradually started to obtain export licenses for destinations
including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia.

The company, based in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, has
benefited from government grants over the years. Last year, government
grants accounted for as much as 45% of JL Mag's net profit, according to
its latest annual report.

On Thursday, Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech, another magnet
manufacturer, also announced that it received export licenses for some
of its orders.

Both JL Mag and Zhong Ke have increased their reliance on overseas
buyers in recent years as margins at home dwindle. In 2024, JL Mag and
Zhong Ke's overseas sales accounted for roughly 18% and 60%,
respectively, of company revenue. Direct exports to the U.S. accounted
for less than 10% of revenue at each of the two companies.

[Chinese customs data released earlier this month showed China's overall
export growth slowed last month, with shipments to the U.S. sinking 35%
from a year earlier in dollar-denominated terms, the biggest such
decline in percentage terms since February 2020]{.underline}.

lily

The long-cultivated dominance is now actively deployed in the context of
intensifying geopolitical rivalry.

[On April 4, 2025, Beijing imposed new export controls and a stringent
licensing system on specific medium, heavy rare earths, and several rare
earth magnets.]{.underline}

Officially, China cited national security and non-proliferation
concerns. However, just [two days after new U.S. tariffs were announced,
the timing strongly suggests the measures are a retaliatory action
against escalating U.S. trade and technology restrictions, particularly
those targeting Chinese tech firms.]{.underline}

[The export licensing system]{.underline} itself serves as more than
just a control mechanism. It [requires detailed information about the
end-user and specific end-use, effectively serving as an
intelligence-gathering tool that allows Beijing to map foreign
dependencies and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.]{.underline}

Adam Dunnett of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China reported that "some
applicants are asked for sensitive information that might compromise
their intellectual property" to secure a license.

[Adding to the pressure, China has intensified crackdowns on REE
smuggling, ensuring the formal licensing system is the only export
channel. As a joint statement from the Ministry of Commerce put it,
"Strategic mineral export control is related to national security and
development interests, and strengthening the control of the entire
export chain is the key.]{.underline}

[Taiwan's military planners said **U.S. support** is **essential** to
the security of the island, signaling to Washington the desire for a
stable relationship]{.underline} as anxieties simmer in Taipei about
whether President [Trump would send help to **defend** against a
**Chinese attack**.]{.underline}

[Taiwan's Defense Ministry,]{.underline} in a security road map for the
next four years, [emphasized the **usefulness** of U.S. support in areas
including **intelligence**, **reconnaissance** and ensuring the ability
to carry out long-range **precision strikes**---as well as Taiwan's
longtime reliance on purchases of American-made **military
hardware**.]{.underline}

["The **U.S. is a crucial strategic partner**, working closely with us
on military cooperation and helping to boost our **self-defense
capabilities**,"]{.underline} the ministry said in the report, the
Quadrennial Defense Review, which is issued in the first year of every
new presidential administration to outline policy direction.

[The report]{.underline} was the first in which the ministry [devoted an
entire section to Taiwan's relationship with the U.S.
military.]{.underline} In the last edition in 2021, U.S. exchanges were
mentioned for the first time, with only a single bullet point.

The ministry's broader military planning outline suggested that
[Taiwan's strategy of trying to deter China on multiple levels hasn't
changed, but that Chinese capabilities---including gains in cyberwarfare
and drone warfare---have shifted.]{.underline}

China claims the island as its own territory and hasn't ruled out the
use of force to seize control. It carries out regular military exercises
in the waters and airspace around the island in a long-running pressure
campaign. In Chinese drills on Monday, Beijing deployed at least 54
warplanes and attack drones and nine naval vessels near Taiwan, the
island's Defense Ministry said.

[Taiwan envisions Chinese assaults on the island to potentially come by
land, sea, air, space and with cyberattacks, among others]{.underline}.
China could launch a rapid invasion or blockade Taiwan to try to
pressure it into submission, according to the Defense Ministry's report
released Tuesday.

[**Taiwan** still **looks to the U.S. to deter China from going that
far**, and stepping in if needed.]{.underline} The new material on the
U.S. in Tuesday's report could mean "exchanges with the U.S. is an
essential area we're going to keep strengthening in the future," said
Lin Ying-yu, a defense expert who teaches at Tamkang University in
Taiwan.

Should China Use a Nuclear Weapon Against Taiwan?

We discuss a potential war between China and Taiwan extensively in these
digital pages for a reason. A Chinese operation against the island could
begin with a blockade or quarantine (non-kinetic) and graduate to an
all-out amphibious invasion (kinetic).

[One aspect often overlooked is the [potential for **escalation** to
**nuclear war**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark} currently [possesses]{.mark}]{.underline} around
[[600]{.mark} nuclear [warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the country
[wants at least **1,000** by **2030.**]{.underline} It is not clear if
Xi Jinping would ever order the use of a doomsday device against Taiwan
as China has a no-first-use policy, but atomic scenarios are worth
examining.

China's Conventional Attack Would Devastate Taiwan

The Chinese military order of battle would begin with a shock and awe
campaign against Taipei and defense sites around the island.
[[Ballistic]{.mark} missiles [and cruise missiles]{.mark} from shore
launchers, fighter jets, bombers, surface ships, and submarines [would
**devastate Taiwan** before]{.mark} an [amphibious
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Airplanes]{.underline} would also [drop
guided bombs]{.underline}. [China]{.underline} frequently
[rehearses]{.underline} amphibious [operations]{.underline}, and the new
landing barges it has built can deploy numerous tanks and armored
personnel carriers to hit the beaches.

How Would Taiwan Fight Back?

[Taipei could wave the white flag after the initial assault.
Or]{.underline} it could [defend its borders with rocket, missile, and
artillery fire]{.underline}. Air defense batteries would be busy. There
are few landing zones, and these are heavily defended. Additionally,
roads to Taipei are limited, which would prevent the tanks from rolling
to the capital unimpeded.

Taipei could give up quickly or choose to fight on. But one effective
strategy would be to execute a lengthy insurgency as the defenders head
for the hills for guerrilla warfare. Taiwan is a mountainous island with
high peaks. An insurgency would be brutal for the Chinese to defend
against.

China Could Starve Taiwan

However, China's blockade and no-fly zone would take its toll. [[Taiwan
may have as little as one month of food and energy
reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}. It [imports]{.underline} over [90 percent
of its energy supplies and a significant portion of its
food]{.underline}. Taipei would eventually give up if a blockade chokes
it off.

That leaves the insurgent fighters in the mountains. They could fight on
indefinitely and survive by foraging for food. This is where Xi Jinping
could get frustrated. A fiercely fought [[insurgency would
**significantly lengthen**]{.mark} the war]{.underline}. China would not
control the entire island, and the clock would begin ticking as the
counterinsurgency campaign may struggle to eliminate all Taiwanese
fighters on the island.

[This is the [point at which **Xi** could **consider** using a **nuclear
weapon**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The choice to detonate a nuclear device
would be [fraught with risk]{.underline}, but he [certainly has the
wherewithal to do it with high-yield, strategic weapons.]{.underline}

What About Chinese Tactical Nuclear Weapons?

There is another choice -- tactical nuclear devices. [The Defense
Tactical Information Center says that there is little information on
China's battlefield nuclear weapons program]{.underline}.

Xi would likely not order a high-yield strike and would instead rely on
a smaller, non-strategic device. ArmsControl.org notes that "one key
missing capability is a large or diverse set of theater or tactical
nuclear capabilities for limited nuclear strikes."

Thus, [China may not even have any tactical]{.underline} nuclear
[weapons]{.underline}, although [**Xi** would likely **prefer** to
**develop** them]{.underline}. [A high-yield strategic **nuclear
weapon** would **destroy** the **entire island** along with Chinese
troops so that a battlefield weapon would be the other
choice.]{.underline}

Taiwanese nuclear strategists have worried about the advent of Chinese
low-yield nuclear weapons for 20 years. In 2005, Taiwanese Colonel Wen
Shang Hsien said that [China's nuclear strategy called for "a preemptive
strike strategy"]{.underline} with [China's use of "its tactical nuclear
weapons in regional wars if necessary,"]{.underline} according to the
National Institute for Public Policy, an American think tank in
Virginia.

The U.S. Military May Come to Taiwan's Rescue

Another consideration for Xi and his generals is whether the United
States should intervene during a blockade or invasion of Taiwan. **[If
China lost]{.underline}** many of its ships, submarines, and airplanes
[to]{.underline} the [Americans,]{.underline} [Xi could be pushed to do
the unthinkable. He **may test** an **ICBM** to frighten and freeze
Washington into halting its fight against China]{.underline}. This is
probably [a more **likely scenario**]{.underline} than Xi choosing the
full-on nuclear option against Taiwan.

What if roles were reversed, and it is the United States that would
consider using a non-strategic weapon against China?

The Pentagon's 2022 report to Congress on Chinese military capabilities
stated, "By late 2018, [PRC concerns began]{.underline} to emerge that
the [United States would use low-yield weapons against its Taiwan
invasion fleet]{.underline}," according to the Atlantic Council.

This would, of course, **[lead to Armageddon]{.underline}** as
[China]{.underline} would surely [**respond** with **high-yield**
weapons against North America with its ICBMs and intermediate-range
nuclear weapons against U.S. targets in Guam, Japan, and South
Korea]{.underline}. This all-out nuclear war has a low probability but
must be considered by strategists from the United States and China.

### Taiwan\-\--Impact\-\--Space Mod

#### Taiwan invasion [spills over]{.underline} into space. Space war is the most [probable]{.underline} outcome.

[Space is fast becoming a **new battlefield**.]{.underline} In an
emerging era of great power competition, [China poses a **multidomain
security threat** to the United States. War in space has become a
dangerous and **genuine possibility**]{.underline}. Consequently[, the
United States must respond to the growing multidomain Chinese threat by
enhancing deterrence in space.]{.underline}

[The more adept China becomes at being able to credibly target American
space capabilities, the more vulnerable the United States becomes to a
**devastating celestial attack**]{.underline}. And the more vulnerable
the United States's celestial assets become, [the greater the **cost of
war in space** will be]{.underline}.

In its [14th Five-Year Plan]{.underline}, the People's Republic of China
([PRC) outlined its commitment to strengthening military capabilities in
space. Enhancing]{.underline} space-based military [capabilities aligns
with President Xi Jinping's vision of China as a dominant space
power]{.underline}. President [**Xi** considers **superiority in space**
to be **critical** to securing vital interests]{.underline}. In
September 2021, President Xi stated that ['space is an important
strategic asset for the country that must be well **managed** and
**utilised**]{.underline}.' Managed and utilised for hard power
purposes.

A 2023 Pentagon report on Chinese military and security developments
states that the [**PRC's** space-based capabilities '**increase**
China's monitoring **capabilities**---including observation of US
aircraft carriers, expeditionary strike groups, and deployed air
wings]{.underline}. Space capabilities will [enhance]{.underline}
People's Liberation Army [(PLA) military operations farther from the
Chinese coast]{.underline}.' Furthermore, Chinese [counterspace
capabilities are continually evolving]{.underline}, and [**Beijing's**
space **strategy extends** beyond intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and encompasses a range of kinetic
assets that can be used to target and strike the United States **in
orbit, on land, air, and sea**]{.underline}. Namely, operational
space-based direct ascent capabilities are paired with ground-based
space capabilities that can be employed for offensive and defensive
purposes.

For example, weapons systems such as anti-satellite (ASAT) missiles can
destroy low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, striking targets at distances
between 800 to 30,000 kilometres above Earth. Furthermore, the
diversification and expansion program of China's strategic weapons
delivery systems indicates that it seeks to be a major military power in
the space domain.

'In July 2021, the PRC conducted its first fractional orbital launch of
an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) with a hypersonic glide
vehicle from China,' states the Pentagon's 2023 report. 'This
demonstrated the greatest distance flown (\~40,000 kilometres) and
longest flight time (\~100+minutes) of any Chinese land attack weapons
system to date.' According to scholars Caitlin Talmadge and Joshua
Rovner, the hypersonic glide vehicle tested in July 2021 was also
nuclear-capable. However, they observe that there is no indication that
a nuclear weapon was mounted atop the fractional orbital bombardment
system (FOBS) used. Nevertheless, as Talmadge and Rovner portentously
stated: '\[while\] China did not mount a nuclear weapon on the rocket in
this test, it could do so in the future.'

[**Beijing** is essentially **enhancing** its space **capabilities** to
gain a **strategic advantage over Washington**]{.underline}. Under
President Xi Jinping, [Beijing]{.underline} has also [invested heavily
in satellite technology]{.underline} that it claims can [render the
ocean transparent]{.underline}, thus potentially [enabling China to
target America's deep-sea assets]{.underline}. China's [ISR capabilities
have been significantly enhanced]{.underline} due to the development of
its Death Star satellite. These [capabilities can potentially be
leveraged in anti-submarine warfare (ASW), putting US operations and
**assets at sea at risk.**]{.underline}

According to experts at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI),
China's Death Star satellite is an orbital laser detection system that
scans targeted areas at sea and has enhanced visibility capabilities,
with penetration depths of up to 500 metres. Light Detection and Ranging
(LIDAR) systems are not without their operational disadvantages. LIDAR
lasers incur instant power loss when they hit the ocean's surface.
Various factors can negatively affect the efficacy of space-based laser
systems, most notably weather conditions and oceanic currents,
indicating that these systems are far from accurate or assured.
Nevertheless, while these systems are not perfect, they are constantly
subject to technological improvements, and such mechanisms are likely to
be harnessed to maximise potential efficacy in the future.

[The United States's ability to secure its vital interests is contingent
on how effectively and credibly it deters China from space]{.underline}.
Especially as space serves a critical role in the United States's
ability to function militarily. According to Greg Austin, Rajeswari
Rajagopalan and Timothy Wright at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies ([IISS]{.underline}), the [United States relies on
space for the following military capabilities: ISR; Positioning,
Navigation and Timing (PNT); early warning of nuclear missile attack;
environmental monitoring; and communications for command and
control]{.underline}. In all, the United States has 137 military
[satellites]{.underline} in space---each [critical to]{.underline}
enabling the United States to [maintain and fulfil its nuclear
deterrence mission]{.underline}.

The [**first domain** affected by strategic nuclear war would be
**space**]{.underline}, as ICBMs must leave Earth before re-entering the
atmosphere to strike targets. [Ballistic missile defence systems must
intercept incoming strategic nuclear attacks in space.]{.underline}
Therefore, [collisions between]{.underline} military
[assets]{.underline} carrying nuclear warheads would
**[wreak]{.underline}** devastating [**consequences** for]{.underline}
both [civilian and military assets in space]{.underline}.

As the Strategic Posture Commission report states, ['Chinese advances in
**offensive counterspace** capabilities pose an **increasingly** serious
threat to US and allied and partner space capabilities that enable US
power projection, missile attack warning, and nuclear command and
control,]{.underline}' before [recommending]{.underline} that 'the
[United States should urgently deploy a more resilient space
architecture and adopt offensive and defensive element to ensure US
access to and operations in Space.]{.underline}'

The **[lack of transparency]{.underline}** over its rapid nuclear
expansion programme has [**exacerbated** Washington's **distrust** of
Beijing]{.underline}. Should a **[nuclear crisis erupt over
Taiwan]{.underline}**, for example, [**space capabilities would be
targeted**, or worse, **attacked**]{.underline}. [Hence, **escalation to
the nuclear level of war** would affect and **include space.** Ensuring
greater resilience in space is of paramount importance to the United
States]{.underline}.

Deterring in space also requires the United States to be bolder in its
targeting policies. Ultimately, deterrence is about threatening to
inflict unacceptable damage on the adversary. Targeting China's critical
space assets and making it clear to the PRC that the United States would
be ready to strike those assets, is a critical step toward enhancing
deterrence in space. '[War in space]{.underline},' Aaron Bateman warns,
['would have far-reaching and catastrophic consequences]{.underline}.'
Beijing and Washington should heed his warning.

The [next war may begin without a sound---**in orbit**]{.underline}, far
above the battlefield. As [satellite proximity operations, grappling
technologies, and AI-enabled space **systems proliferate**, space is no
longer just a technical domain; it is a **new theater of
power**.]{.underline} Orbital [assets]{.underline} are fast [becoming
the front line of great power confrontation,]{.underline} yet
international norms and [deterrence]{.underline} doctrines have [not
caught up]{.underline}, creating a **[world]{.underline}** that is
[dangerously **unprepared** for the political and military
**consequences** of space-based **first strikes**.]{.underline}

In March 2025, US Space Force General Michael A. Guetlein, the vice
chief of space operations, revealed that American systems had observed
"five different objects in space maneuvering in and out and around each
other in synchronicity and in control," a scenario he called
"[dogfighting in space]{.underline}." [China]{.underline}, along with
the [United States]{.underline} and [other major space
powers]{.underline}, is [rapidly developing counterspace
capabilities]{.underline}. These aren't science-fiction weapons; [they
reflect a **strategic shift**]{.underline}. Satellites are the nervous
system of [modern warfare, vital for intelligence, navigation, and
communication.]{.underline} [Disabling]{.underline} an adversary's
[satellites]{.underline} can [blind]{.underline} its
[battlefield]{.underline} or [situational awareness and create a
powerful advantage in the early stages of conflict.]{.underline}

Unlike traditional warfare, there is [no clear legal framework for what
constitutes aggression in space]{.underline}. Satellite interference can
be [framed as a malfunction, a test, or a provocation, making it an
ideal gray-zone tactic]{.underline}. The [first move]{.underline} in the
next major conflict [may not come as a missile strike or
cyberattack]{.underline}, but as a silent, deniable maneuver in orbit
that signals war before the world even realizes it has begun, just like
the February 2022 cyberattack on Viasat in the hours before Russia
launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Orbital Infrastructure

Orbital infrastructures are vast, planet-spanning systems that
materially and politically structure how we monitor, secure, and
conceptualize threats to Earth. Columba Peoples and Tim Stevens describe
them as "sociotechnical assemblages"---[networks of satellites, ground
stations, governance frameworks, and human expertise that link activity
in space to politics, economics, and **security on Earth.**]{.underline}

Most people don't realize how deeply embedded these systems are in daily
life. Satellites power GPS navigation, enable global internet and phone
service, forecast the weather, and monitor climate change. They support
financial transactions, TV broadcasts, communications, and emergency
response. [Without them, much of the **modern
world**]{.underline}---from logistics to banking---[would **slow down**
or **stop entirely**]{.underline}. They are part of the critical,
invisible infrastructure that [makes modern life possible]{.underline},
as essential and often overlooked as power lines, undersea cables, or
air traffic control systems.

Militarily, satellites are indispensable. They enable real-time
surveillance of troop movements, missile deployments, and naval
activity, providing the awareness of the operational environment that
modern commanders rely on. They support secure communications across
continents and guide precision weapons using GPS. Some systems even
provide early warning of missile launches, offering precious minutes to
respond. In modern conflict, satellites aren't a backdrop; they're part
of the battlefield.

These orbital infrastructures are more than tools of observation or
communication; they are embedded in the machinery of modern statecraft.
From coordinating humanitarian relief to supporting precision targeting
and military operations, they blur the line between civilian and
military systems. As their strategic value grows, so too does the need
to define and defend their boundaries---before another state tests the
in silence.

Satellite Tampering as a First Strike

[Satellite tampering]{.underline} refers to any deliberate interference
with a satellite's function---[increasingly seen as a potential first
move in modern conflict]{.underline}. This can include jamming (blocking
radio signals), dazzling (using lasers to blind sensors), cyber
intrusion (hijacking or disabling a satellite remotely), or even
physical manipulation (maneuvering near or pushing another satellite out
of position). What makes satellite tampering so dangerous is that it can
be done silently, without debris or explosions, making it both feasible
and deniable. In a tense geopolitical moment, disrupting satellites
could blind an opponent's surveillance, sever communications, or degrade
navigation, all without firing a single shot on the ground. Not only is
this kind of interference invisible to the naked eye, but it can also be
layered: Attackers may alter or erase diagnostic data itself, leaving
operators uncertain whether a satellite is malfunctioning, compromised,
or both. Recent events like GPS anomalies and a tanker collision near
the Strait of Hormuz on June 17 demonstrate how invisible, electronic
interference in space-based systems can have real-world, dangerous
consequences without a traceable act of war.

Reports of ["dogfighting in space]{.underline}"---with Chinese
satellites maneuvering in synchronized, controlled formation[,
simulating close-range orbital combat---underscore how **real** and
**immediate** this threat has become]{.underline}. While not openly
hostile, these actions demonstrate the capability to trail, shadow, and
potentially interfere with foreign satellites. [Combined with advances
in cyber and electronic warfare, these maneuvers suggest that **space**
is **shifting** from a **support domain** to an active
**battlefield**.]{.underline} The line between exercise and aggression
is blurring, and satellite tampering is no longer theoretical. It has
become a tool for signaling, disruption, and disabling critical systems
in the opening minutes of conflict.

The Viasat attack during Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine shows how
effective space-based disruption can be. Hours before Russian troops
crossed the border, hackers deployed malware that crippled the KA-SAT
satellite network, disabling tens of thousands of modems across Europe.
The result was widespread communication outages, including within
Ukraine's military. By targeting a civilian-operated satellite system,
[Russia demonstrated how space-based **infrastructure** can be
**exploited** for **strategic gain,** blinding and destabilizing an
adversary before conventional warfare begins.]{.underline}

China has closely studied both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and
drawn key lessons about the role of space infrastructure in modern
warfare. From Russia's early cyberattack on Viasat, China saw how
disrupting satellite communications can cripple an adversary's ability
to coordinate, respond, and stay connected, making satellite
interference a valuable tool for preinvasion advantage. At the same
time, Ukraine's rapid pivot to SpaceX's Starlink showed the power of
resilient, decentralized megaconstellations to restore connectivity,
maintain command and control, and support both military and civilian
functions in real time. Together, these lessons have shaped China's
approach to space warfare: Disable your opponent's satellites early and
ensure your own communications cannot be taken offline. This thinking is
reflected in China's push to build sovereign megaconstellations like
Guowang and Qianfan, not just for commercial purposes, but to guarantee
wartime resilience and strategic independence in orbit.

China's Megaconstellations

Guowang and Qianfan are China's planned satellite megaconstellations
designed to provide global internet coverage while strengthening the
country's independence and resilience in space-based communications.
Guowang, meaning "national network," is expected to include around
thirteen thousand satellites and will serve as a sovereign satellite
internet system, led by state-owned enterprises such as the China
Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. It is intended to offer
secure broadband services domestically and globally, akin to Starlink,
reducing reliance on external or nondomestic systems, while supporting
both civilian and military operations. Qianfan, meaning "thousand
sails," is a parallel constellation with roughly fourteen thousand
planned satellites, a fleet of orbiting assets working in coordinated
formation.

While both projects are publicly positioned as commercial and
technological ventures, they are deeply dual-use, designed to enable
hardened, decentralized communications that can survive wartime
disruption and operate independently of Western infrastructure.

Together, [Guowang and Qianfan represent more than just technological
ambition.]{.underline} They reflect [China's broader
strategy]{.underline} to [dominate]{.underline} orbital [infrastructure,
assert digital sovereignty, and ensure command-and-control continuity in
a contested, congested information environment]{.underline}. In any
future conflict, these constellations will be as critical to Chinese
power projection as aircraft carriers or missile systems, just as
Starlink has become indispensable to Ukraine.

The Need for a New Deterrence Theory

Deterrence theory is built on a simple premise: You prevent an adversary
from taking an unwanted action (typically aggression) by making the cost
of that action outweigh any potential benefit. Effective deterrence
depends on three elements: capability (the ability to retaliate or
respond), credibility (the ability to convince an adversary you will
act), and communication (clear signaling of red lines and consequences).

[A disabled satellite can be framed as a technical failure or an act of
war]{.underline}. That ambiguity is what [makes space so strategically
volatile]{.underline}. Satellites malfunction regularly due to
radiation, debris, or aging hardware. This [natural uncertainty provides
cover for deliberate interference]{.underline}. A rival
[state]{.underline} could jam, spoof, or physically disrupt a satellite
while [plausibly denying responsibility]{.underline}. But the
operational [**impact** is **immediate**: Intelligence is lost,
communications break down, and targeting or navigation systems go
dark]{.underline}. In a domain without clear rules of engagement or
trusted verification mechanisms, a single orbital incident [could
**spark** a broader **military crisis**]{.underline} before
decision-makers fully understand what happened.

As more nations deploy maneuverable satellites and integrate dual-use
AI, the [**risk** of accidental **escalation** is
**growing**]{.underline}. In space, nearly everything is dual-use: The
same satellite delivering internet or weather data may also support
military surveillance or missile guidance. [Without clear
boundaries]{.underline}, even a routine orbital maneuver could be
misinterpreted as a provocation, [leading to real-world **consequences**
far **beyond Earth's atmosphere.**]{.underline}

### Readiness\-\--Internal\-\--2AC

#### Status quo reliance [kills readiness]{.underline}. Alternative supply is key.

But the [miscalculation over rare earths is]{.underline} particularly
[problematic because it puts **America's military's edge at
risk**]{.underline}. The White House [must either ratchet down its
**hostility** toward Beijing **or** quickly **find an alternative
supply**.]{.underline} Given China's control over the industry and the
Trump administration's evident distaste for stepping back when it comes
to China, both options look to be long shots.

This quandary is not entirely of Trump's making. The [**supply risk**
became **obvious** nearly 15 years ago, when **Beijing imposed** a
seven-week **embargo on exports** of rare earth elements]{.underline} to
Japan in a dispute over a Chinese fishing trawler caught in contested
waters. Since 2023, China has restricted exports of strategic materials
such as gallium, germanium and graphite to the United States.

Despite [official warnings about the danger of depending on China for
such critical materials]{.underline} and the **[need to diversify
supplies]{.underline}**, [there has been **limited U.S.** government
**support** for the rare earths industry.]{.underline}

Market forces alone won't solve this problem. Investments in [**domestic
mining** and refining have **made little sense**]{.underline} because
rare earths and magnets were [always available from China at low
cost]{.underline}. After China's 2010 embargo on exports to Japan, the
Obama administration encouraged Hitachi Metals to build a rare earths
magnet factory in North Carolina. But the plant closed in 2015, after
less than two years in operation.

[**Domestic capacity** to produce rare earths is **extremely limited**.
One mine in California is active]{.underline}. And the company that runs
it, MP Materials, plans to ramp up domestic refining and has a magnet
production facility coming online in Texas. But the [trade war with
China has put it in a bind]{.underline}, as it [shipped]{.underline}
most of its [concentrates to China for processing.]{.underline} Another
firm, [Australia's Lynas Rare Earths]{.underline}, is building a
refinery for heavy rare earths in Texas, but it is [struggling under
high costs]{.underline}. [USA Rare Earth has big plans]{.underline} but
still [nothing in production.]{.underline}

China's stranglehold on rare earths

Despite President Donald Trump's repeated calls for President Xi Jinping
to reach out to secure a deal to de-escalate their trade war, Beijing
has pledged to 'fight to the end.' In response to US tariffs, [China has
**imposed restrictions** on the exports of seven rare earth minerals,
along with other products including permanent magnets.]{.underline}

[China produces the **vast majority** of the world's **r**are **e**arth
**m**ineral**s**,]{.underline} a group of 17 elements that are
critically important for modern technology, from magnets to lasers to
LCD screens.

**90 per cent** of rare earth **processing** globally.]{.underline} In
contrast, while the US is the second largest producer with the seventh
largest reserves, it [falls **far short** of China's output and **relies
on Beijing** for imports.]{.underline} Washington excluded critical
minerals from its global reciprocal tariffs, reflecting their importance
to US interests.

This [gives China a **stranglehold over inputs** into supply chains that
are crucial to **American primacy**,]{.underline} [from semiconductors
to aircraft]{.underline}. For example, dysprosium is needed to
heat-proof electric motors used in the US Air Force's 'fifth generation'
F-35 fighter jets, as well as for applications in robotics, drones,
electric vehicles, and touch screens. Another important example is
yttrium, which is essential for jet engines, precision lasers, and
high-frequency radar. Both are among the seven rare earths restricted by
Beijing.

[China is **leveraging** its core role in supply chains]{.underline}
from which the US has sought to exclude it [-- most notably
semiconductors]{.underline}. The [move **sends a message**]{.underline}:
while the US might attempt to cut China off from the most advanced chips
and other cutting-edge technologies, [China could go one step further by
**cutting off** the supply chain]{.underline} upstream.

By restricting access to critical minerals, [China has the potential to
do **serious damage**]{.underline} to the US defence industry and
undermine the Trump administration's wider reindustrialization
ambitions.

Chinese [exporters of the restricted rare earths have already reported a
**halt to shipments**]{.underline} as they await licenses from the
Chinese Ministry of Commerce, a system which gives Beijing the ability
to regulate the flow of the minerals in the case of a protracted trade
war.

In the long term, the US could try to build up its own extraction and
processing operations, but this will take time and has a high financial
and environmental cost. This would likewise be the case for other
countries the US might seek to partner with.

[US-China **military competition**]{.underline}

The [restrictions on minerals could undermine]{.underline} the Trump
administration's broad [ambitions to secure **US primacy**]{.underline}
over China. These [include the return of manufacturing to the US through
a **massive reindustrialization** programme, commitment to global
leadership in emerging technologies such as AI, and a strategy to
**deter Chinese aggression** towards Taiwan]{.underline} through
overwhelming and regionally focused military power backed by a \$1
trillion defense budget. Both reindustrialization and leadership in
emerging technologies will be essential if the US is to deter China
militarily in the coming decades.

[**Restricted access** to China's rare earths put these ambitions **at
risk**]{.underline}. Long-term restrictions could have far-reaching
effects on Washington's defense industrial base and the global supply
chains of machine tools and chips it relies on, including for AI and
other technologies used in advanced military applications.

Even without restricting mineral exports, China already has a decisive
advantage in manufacturing capacity.

[The US is also at risk of **losing the race** in competitive areas of
defence and emerging technology]{.underline}. In some areas, such as
hypersonic missile technology, China is already more advanced. In
others, restricted access to minerals could prove crucial.

A key area of competition is over fighter aircraft. President Trump
recently unveiled a commitment to develop the F-47, a new 'sixth
generation' aircraft with advanced capabilities designed to supersede
the US Air Force's existing fighters. Meanwhile, two Chinese advanced
prototype aircraft (the J-36 and J-50) have been observed on repeated
test flights, indicating that China is developing similarly advanced
aircraft.

A [lack of critical minerals could ensure that China **wins the race**
to deploy a 'sixth generation' fighter, which would be a significant
milestone.]{.underline} China would be taking the lead in an area
synonymous with US military dominance, one that could prove decisive in
the long term.

China's manufacturing lead

A technological lead is important. But in the event of a protracted
US--China conflict the ability to sustain an adequate fighting force
will be decisive. This is where industrial capacity matters -- including
sophisticated machine tools required for weapon production that rely on
rare earths.

Even without restricting mineral exports, China already has a decisive
advantage in manufacturing capacity. Strategists in Washington have
voiced concerns about the vast 'ship gap,' with US intelligence
estimating that China's shipping production capacity is more than 200
times that of the US.

In a potential war, Beijing could replenish its stockpiles of munitions
much faster than Washington. Meanwhile, China's rate of military
aircraft production is rapidly catching up with the US. Washington now
risks facing a 'fighter jet gap' in which Beijing outproduces it in
cutting-edge aircraft. Rare earth restrictions make closing these gaps
even more difficult for Washington.

The [risk of **escalating tensions**]{.underline}

The most credible solution for the US to counter China's manufacturing
advantage is to systematically partner with allies. However, this faces
two major obstacles. First, China has the ability to tailor its export
restrictions to affect specific countries, giving Beijing a tool to
deter them from assisting the US.

Second, the Trump administration's use of tariffs against both friends
and foes has strained its relations with its traditional allies and
undermined trust. This could weaken Washington's ability to convince
allies to align with a strategy to counter China premised on US military
primacy, especially outside the Indo-Pacific where allies do not face a
direct military threat from Beijing.

While a trade war in itself is unlikely to directly spark a military
war, it could increase the appetite for risk on both sides, especially
given increasing tensions between China and Taiwan.

If the trade war continues and [the impact of rare earth export
restrictions **begins to hit** in the US, it is unclear how Washington
will respond. Given escalating US--China tensions, there is a risk that
Washington could begin to view the restrictions as an **existential
threat** to its military primacy and seek **further
escalation**.]{.underline} While a trade war in itself is unlikely to
directly spark a military war, it could increase the appetite for risk
on both sides, especially given increasing tensions between China and
Taiwan.

[China's **strategic dominance** in **r**are **e**arth **e**lement**s**,
especially heavy ones critical for defense and clean energy
technologies, threatens **global supply chain security**]{.underline}.
This dominance arises from its vast resource endowment and a vertically
integrated, state-led industrial strategy encompassing mining,
processing and manufacturing. To counter this asymmetry, allied
democracies must develop coherent, long-term policies that match China's
scale, strategic resolve and institutional consistency.

Once obscure and overlooked, rare [earth elements (REEs) are now **at
the heart** of the 21st-century technological revolution]{.underline}.
From precision-guided missiles and electric vehicles to wind turbines
and smartphones, [REEs power the **critical systems** that define our
digital and low-carbon future. As the global shift toward
**electrification** and **renewable energy** accelerates, demand is
**spreading**]{.underline} across nearly the entire Periodic Table,
driven by the unique, irreplaceable functions of these
often-unconventional materials. At the center of this transformation
stand the 17 distinct REEs, indispensable to the modern world yet
challenging to secure.

Rare earths (the general term encompassing all REEs) are typically
divided into light and heavy categories. While light REEs like cerium
and lanthanum are more abundant, it is the heavy ones --- dysprosium,
terbium, neodymium and others --- that are essential for permanent
magnets used in high-temperature environments, such as electric vehicle
motors, fighter jets and missile guidance systems.

Magnet strength declines significantly at high temperatures if lighter
REEs are used alone. Thus, high-density rare earths must be mixed in to
maintain performance. China controls nearly 99% of heavy REE processing,
not just because of resource abundance, but because it has developed and
protected its technical edge in separation processes. Moreover, Chinese
firms often operate at a loss but are supported by state subsidies,
which allows them to drive out global competition.

[China's rare earth **dominance**]{.underline} and the strategic supply
chain asymmetry

Despite large-scale investment --- over \$439 million from the
Department of Defense since 2020 --- the [United States **remains
dependent** on Chinese magnets]{.underline}. For example, MP Materials,
the [**leading US producer**, plans to produce]{.underline} just 1,000
metric tons of neodymium-boron-iron (NdFeB) magnets annually by 2025.
That is [**less than 1%** of China's 2018 output.]{.underline}

Even promising breakthroughs, such as USA Rare Earth's 99.1% pure
dysprosium oxide sample in early 2025, remain at the pilot stage.
Commercial viability is years away. In the meantime, Chinese production
continues to scale. In 2024 alone, China produced an estimated 300,000
tons of NdFeB magnets. The US's goal of an independent REE supply chain
by 2027 remains aspirational, not assured.

China's advantage lies in its vertical integration, from mining to
refining to magnet production. It has built and subsidized its REE
ecosystem through environmental externalization, industrial policy
coherence and technological investment. In doing so, it has created a
monopolistic grip on the midstream and downstream segments of the supply
chain. This control gives Beijing strategic leverage, which it has
exploited several times. In 2010, Beijing cut off exports to Japan over
maritime disputes, and in 2023--2024, it implemented licensing
restrictions to retaliate against US semiconductor export controls and
tariffs. These measures have not been wholesale bans but targeted,
calibrated interventions designed to inject uncertainty, pressure
adversaries and reassert industrial dominance.

The [nature of this dominance reveals a deeper **structural asymmetry**:
China is able to play a **long game,** enabled by centralized
**political authority** and strategic continuity]{.underline}.
Democracies, meanwhile, struggle to maintain long-term consistency
across administrations. In game-theoretic terms, China acts as a
high-commitment actor in a repeated, asymmetric game.

Without equivalent institutional coherence, the [US and its allies are
**consistently reacting** to Beijing's initiatives rather than shaping
the trajectory of the REE landscape.]{.underline}

Rare earths and US tariffs

In response to sweeping US tariffs in 2025 --- up to 145% on Chinese
imports [--- Beijing **strategically restricted** the export of several
rare earths]{.underline}, including dysprosium and neodymium. [This move
**intensified concerns** across global industries]{.underline}, with
automakers and defense contractors warning of severe production
disruptions due to limited alternative suppliers.

The tit-for-tat escalated until the two parties announced a provisional
deal in London. China agreed to resume shipments of rare earths and
magnets to the US in exchange for tariff reductions to 55% and the
easing of restrictions on Chinese students studying in America. US
President Donald Trump claimed victory, stating that the "full magnets,
and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China."
However, details remain vague and enforcement mechanisms unclear. Both
sides characterized the deal as a "framework" still awaiting final
approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump.

Despite this temporary truce, [the rare earth dispute underscores the
**strategic risks** of supply chain concentration. The US continues to
**rely heavily** on China for processed REEs, especially heavy rare
earths **critical to defense**]{.underline}. Unless structural
diversification is achieved through domestic production, [allied
partnerships or technological alternatives, the **geopolitical
leverage** China holds through its dominance in rare earths will remain
a **persistent vulnerability**]{.underline} for the US and its allies.

[US vulnerability]{.underline} and the emerging strategic response

[**Recognition** of]{.underline} this [strategic vulnerability **has
grown**]{.underline} in Washington[, especially given **defense-sector**

earths; a Virginia-class submarine demands more than **9,000

almost **entirely dependent** on Chinese REE refining and magnet
production]{.underline}. While upstream mining projects exist, such as

[[Minerals are]{.mark} the [newest front in]{.mark} US-China economic
**[warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In recent months, the People's
Republic of [[China]{.mark} has accelerated its
**[us]{.mark}**ag**[e]{.mark}** of [mineral export controls to **choke**
American access]{.mark} to critical minerals, prompting many
policymakers to fear a complete Chinese embargo]{.underline}. But that's
a misunderstanding of Beijing's goals. Instead, it's become clear that
[Chinese policymakers are balancing strategic disruption with the desire
to keep America dependent on Chinese markets.]{.underline}

[If China were to entirely shut off exports to America, the [US]{.mark}
economy [would lose]{.mark} the [ability to manufacture
essential]{.mark} military and commercial [goods]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But an embargo like this would also accelerate US efforts to find
alternative sources of key inputs, reducing US demand for Chinese goods.
That's the last thing China wants.

China doesn't want to crash our economy; it wants to keep us hooked in
order to shape our policy. [The selective usage of export controls keeps
us **reliant** while demonstrating their leverage.]{.underline} And as
long as Chinese imports are cheap and available, and [[America **fails**
to develop domestic sources]{.mark}, their dominance **will
continue.**]{.underline}

[China's recent restrictions on rare earth elements (REEs) are a perfect
example]{.underline}. In April, [China shut off rare earth element
shipments and introduced a licensing regime to curtail largely heavy REE
exports]{.underline}. PRC officials are pressuring companies in other
countries, such as South Korea, not to export products that use
restricted REEs.

That's a [problem for the United States. [REEs are]{.mark} used in
specialized magnets, cars, sensors, aircraft, and other advanced
commercial technologies. They're also [vital for **major weapon
platforms**]{.mark} such as]{.underline} Tomahawk missiles, [[Predator
drones, and **F-35 aircraft**]{.mark}. For such critical hardware, we
**never should have become so reliant on China.**]{.underline}

But geological reality will complicate the path to American REE
production. Compared to light REEs, heavy REEs are less commonly found
and less densely concentrated. Condensed heavy rare earth sources are
most frequently contained within ionic clay deposits, which can be about
forty times more bountiful than major REE sites.

[**[America]{.mark}**'s only REE mine]{.underline}, located at Mountain
Pass in California, [[lacks a sufficient concentration of heavy rare
earths to meet our needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the processing side,
[[we're]{.mark} still [short on **technical capabilities**]{.mark} for
separating our rare earth elements]{.underline}. This is true
[[**despite** the fact]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the
**[D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense [has [poured **hundreds of
millions**]{.mark} **of dollars** [into developing]{.mark}]{.underline}
a [[native]{.mark} REE military [supply chain]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Until that happens, [we're [vulnerable to **foreign
interference**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which the PRC is more than willing
to execute. After productive negotiations in early May to reduce
tariffs, China retained its export licensing regime. On May 30, without
mentioning rare earths, President Trump accused China of violating the
agreement. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury
Secretary Scott Bessent both raised concerns about China's continued REE
export controls. Validating those worries, [automotive industry giants
have warned of an impending magnet shortage that would crush American
car manufacturing,]{.underline} and Ford temporarily closed a Chicago
factory because of difficulties in accessing necessary magnets.

If the countries remain at an impasse over trade and minerals, we will
see more industrial disruption and [pressure on American
policymakers]{.underline}, just as China intends.

First, it [aims to cause strategic disruption without encouraging
disengagement.]{.underline} Right now, American manufacturers are
staring down the possibility of shuttering operations without access to
Chinese magnets. But this won't result in an immediate switch to
American sourcing. The REE market is small and highly price-sensitive.
If we start to develop alternative production, the PRC could start
releasing REEs and magnets again, keeping America dependent.

Second, and perhaps even more importantly, [[China will use export
controls as a **signaling tactic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consider the
[price spikes, factory closures, and supply delays]{.underline} that
would [accompany a shortage]{.underline}, then [multiply that
across]{.underline} the twenty-six [critical minerals]{.underline} that
[China]{.underline} for which [is our **primary** supplier]{.underline}.
Beijing doesn't actually need to sever all these supply chains; it just
needs to signal the will and readiness to do so.

With such powerful leverage, China can play a role in determining
American policy that approaches a veto power. [[If we rely on]{.mark}
the [PRC to provide us with]{.mark} raw [materials]{.mark} **necessary**
for our war-fighting capabilities, then [**our military operates** only
**with their consent**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As President Trump aims to
reshape global trade in pursuit of America's national interest, China's
ability to disrupt American car manufacturing is a powerful point of
pressure.

The turmoil over rare earth elements should dispel policymakers' fears
of a complete Chinese embargo. Selectively applied pressure is enough to
shape American foreign policy while keeping us within the Chinese
mineral supply chain. To counter China's leverage in future
negotiations, American policymakers need to confront the PRC's actual
mineral strategy: perpetual American reliance.

[The United States **revolutionized** air combat with the invention of
stealth technology and the low-observable combat jet]{.underline}.
Beginning in the 1980s with the F-117 and continuing in the years that
followed with the B-2, F-22, F-35, and now the F-47, the evolution of
5th generation and beyond technologies has changed the nature of air
combat forever. Yet today, only 28 percent of the Air Force's fighter
inventory are 5th-generation jets.

[[Given]{.mark} the [advances by **China**]{.mark}, which is [**rapidly
fielding** its own **5th generation**]{.mark} and beyond
[aircraft]{.mark}, the **[U.S.]{.mark}** Air Force **[must grow its
5th-gen fleet]{.mark}**---and soon. Today, there is one aircraft in
production that can answer that call: the F-35]{.underline}.

[The [Air Force]{.mark}, Secretary Pete Hegseth, President Trump, and
Congress **[must boost]{.mark}** F-35 [**acquisition** as **rapidly as
possible**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The omission of additional F-35 funding
in the reconciliation bill now before the Senate shows a dangerous
disconnect regarding this reality.

The vision for 5th-generation stealth capability developed during the
Cold War as a means to counter increasingly lethal Soviet air defenses.
The telltales were ominous: [In]{.underline} the [closing days
of]{.underline} the [**Vietnam War**, the U.S. lost **15 B-52 bombers**
in]{.underline} just [12 days]{.underline}. Less than a year later,
Israel lost 102 of its 390 combat aircraft in the monthlong Yom Kippur
War, 85 of them American-built aircraft.

[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} commanders assessing a potential European
conflict with Warsaw Pact rivals calculated that a [similar loss rate
[would exhaust]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. [Air Force's combat
[aircraft inventory in]{.mark}]{.underline} just **[[two
weeks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As one analyst noted: "[It would be a
**[tragedy]{.mark}** not merely [for the West]{.mark} but for mankind if
NATO]{.underline}, after holding its own tactically, were [to be [faced
with]{.mark} the [choice of]{.mark} **either [surrendering or
initiating]{.mark} a [nuclear exchange]{.mark}** because of
**insufficient reserves**]{.underline}."

The [U.S. needed a game-changing advantage, and that's where stealth
came into play]{.underline}.

The revolutionary F-117, the world's first stealth jet entered the
operational inventory in the 1980s. Paired with precision weapons in
Operation Desert Storm, they changed the rules of modern combat. The
F-117 force flew less than 2 percent of the combat sorties but struck
over 40 percent of the fixed targets.

The B-2 bomber soon followed and raised the game even further in
subsequent conflicts.

Building on these incredible advances, [Air Force leaders packaged
stealth with electronic warfare, advanced sensors, increased on-board
computer processing power, and advanced communications in the F-22 and
F-35 fighters---a collaborative package termed 5th gen]{.underline}. By
[understanding]{.underline} the [combat environment,]{.underline} not
just evading detection, [**5th-generation** aircraft dynamically
**maximized opportunities** while **avoiding** undue
**risk**.]{.underline}

The [combination of stealth and electronic warfare **afforded
advantages** unlike anything ever **seen before**]{.underline}. Today,
other aircraft can achieve parts of this technological equation, but the
[**total integration** of these capabilities is what **makes**
5th-generation **aircraft unique**]{.underline}.

[Enemies can learn to overcome some aspects]{.underline} of 5th-gen
technology in isolation, [but not the game-changing total
package]{.underline}. Just consider what the Israeli Air Force achieved
when it struck targets deep inside Iran in 2024: They penetrated some of
the most heavily defended airspace on the planet, successfully executed
their missions, and all returned safely back to base. Many thought that
sort of mission was impossible to survive.

Yet despite the strategic and performance advantage afforded by 5th gen,
the United States never bought enough of these jets. The Air Force was
originally supposed to acquire 750 F-22s but only ended up with 187.
F-35 production was supposed to scale up dramatically in the 2010s, but
never did. The original production plans would have provided the Air
Force with 800 F-35s by 2020, but it ended up with just 272. That's why
USAF fighters today average a quarter century in age, and why Air [Force
pilots are increasingly at risk against advanced enemy
threats.]{.underline}

There are many reasons for this imbalance. Most tie to inadequate
defense budgets. As retired Gen. Herbert "Hawk" Carlisle, former
commander of Air Combat Command, explained: "We \[thought we had\] a
brief period where, given the counterterrorism fight and other
situations in the world ... we could take risk in the fighter force
structure and get to 5th generation. We took that risk, we never got to
5th gen, and by the way, the world changed and is significantly more
challenging and demanding than ... we thought it was going to be in
2010."

Carlisle is hardly alone in his assessment. Gen. Mark "Grace" Kelly,
another former ACC commander, remarked in 2022: "It's like a bill that
comes to your house ... for 60 multirole fighter squadrons."

It's why Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin recently declared:
"[[America **needs** more **Air Force**]{.mark} and it needs it
**[now]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[We must heed these warnings]{.underline}. [[Resetting]{.mark} this
glaring [air superiority gap will require]{.mark} a multifaceted
approach. [New]{.mark} operational [concepts]{.mark} and capabilities,
[like]{.mark} collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) and [the newly
announced **F-47**]{.mark} next-generation [air dominance
fighter]{.mark}, will be key parts of the equation]{.underline}.

[But the **fastest**, most **effective** way to boost the combat today
remains **buying more F-35s.**]{.underline}

While it is no secret that the F-35 has suffered its share of
development challenges, [the aircraft are nevertheless the most
**capable**, most **affordable,** and most **effective** combat jet in
production, **costing less** than other fighters in
production.]{.underline}

Time is not on America's side. [The nation must either take decisive
steps to **grow capacity** now, or accept that we will **fall short**
when a crisis erupts.]{.underline} That [**risks** strategic
**defeat**.]{.underline} Aircraft take time to build. Pilots and
maintainers cannot learn their trade overnight.

We must invest now to cultivate the deterrent force America needs to
secure peace through strength, or fight and win we must[. It is time to
get serious about the F-35.]{.underline}

### Climate Change\-\--Internal\-\--2AC

#### REEs are vital for new climate tech and mitigation

Eric **Loewen 23** - Eric Loewen graduated from the University of
Illinois studying applied chemistry. His educational background gives
him a broad base from which to approach many topics. He has been working
with topics about advanced materials for over 5 years at Stanford
Materials Corporation (SMC). "The 6 Major Applications of Rare Earth
Elements in Renewable Energy" 04-05-2023
https://www.stanfordmaterials.com/blog/major-applications-of-rare-earth-elements-in-renewable-energy.html -
lily

1\. Wind Turbines

Wind turbines are among the most significant applications of REEs,
particularly for the generation of wind energy. [The production of wind
turbines relies heavily on REEs like neodymium, praseodymium,
dysprosium, and terbium, which are used to manufacture high-strength
permanent magnets. These magnets are essential in the direct-drive
turbines that are preferred for their efficiency and reliability over
gear-driven alternatives.]{.underline}

[The use of REEs in wind turbines enhances their performance by allowing
the creation of more powerful and compact magnets. This results in
turbines that can generate more electricity from the same amount of
wind, making wind energy a more viable and efficient source of renewable
power. As wind energy continues to expand globally, the demand for these
REEs is expected to grow significantly, necessitating a stable and
sustainable supply chain.]{.underline}

2\. Electric Vehicles (EVs)

Electric vehicles (EVs) are another major application of REEs,
particularly in the production of motors. [Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB)
magnets are widely used in EV motors due to their high magnetic strength
and resistance to demagnetization. These characteristics are crucial for
the performance and efficiency of EVs, enabling them to achieve greater
speeds and longer ranges on a single charge.]{.underline}

[The transition to electric mobility is a key component of global
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. As
such, the automotive industry's demand for REEs is rapidly
increasing.]{.underline} Companies like Tesla, BMW, and Renault are
investing heavily in developing more efficient EV motors that rely on
these critical materials.

3\. Solar Panels

Rare earth elements also play a pivotal role in the production of solar
panels, specifically thin-film solar cells. Elements such as dysprosium
and cerium are utilized to improve the efficiency and durability of
these cells. Thin-film solar cells are known for their lightweight and
flexible properties, making them suitable for a wide range of
applications, from rooftop installations to portable solar chargers.

The incorporation of REEs in solar panels helps in enhancing the
photovoltaic conversion efficiency, which is the rate at which sunlight
is converted into electricity. This improvement is vital for increasing
the overall output of solar energy systems and making them more
cost-effective. As the adoption of solar energy continues to rise, the
importance of REEs in this sector becomes increasingly apparent.

4\. Energy Storage Systems

Energy storage systems, particularly advanced batteries, are critical
for balancing energy supply and demand in renewable energy systems. REEs
are integral in the development of these batteries, including
lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in various applications
from electric vehicles to grid storage solutions.

Lithium-ion batteries benefit from the addition of REEs like lanthanum
and cerium, which help in enhancing their energy density, lifespan, and
safety. These improvements are crucial for ensuring that renewable
energy can be stored efficiently and reliably, providing a stable power
supply even when the sun isn\'t shining or the wind isn\'t blowing. As
the demand for renewable energy storage solutions grows, so too does the
need for REEs in this field.

5\. Hydrogen Production

The production of hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen through
electrolysis, involves the use of REEs in various components of
electrolyzers. [Electrolyzers are devices that split water into hydrogen
and oxygen using electricity, and REEs play a crucial role in improving
their efficiency and durability.]{.underline}

[REEs such as yttrium and cerium are used in the catalysts and membranes
of electrolyzers, helping to enhance their performance and reduce energy
consumption. The production of green hydrogen is a key component of the
hydrogen economy, which aims to use hydrogen as a clean energy carrier
for various applications, from fuel cells to industrial processes. The
development of more efficient electrolyzers with the help of REEs is
essential for the widespread adoption of hydrogen as a renewable energy
source.]{.underline}

[The global transition to clean energy will face a rocky road ahead
without a stable and sustainable supply of rare earth elements. With
demand for these materials expected to surge in the coming decades, the
rare earth industry must evolve to meet the needs of the green
economy.]{.underline} This means not only scaling up production but also
diversifying the supply chain and ensuring that REE mining practices are
as sustainable as possible.

As the world pivots toward clean and autonomous technologies, the
importance of rare earth elements has never been clearer. [As
governments, companies and investors recognize rare earths as a key
enabler of this transformation, securing a diversified and sustainable
supply of these critical metals can help fuel the clean energy
revolution while ensuring long-term economic growth, technological
innovation and environmental stewardship.]{.underline}

[Renewable energy is one of the most important parts of climate change
mitigation. Unlike fossil fuels, which release a lot of carbon dioxide
(CO2), renewable energy comes from natural sources that don't pollute
the air.]{.underline}

[Examples of renewable energy include:]{.underline}

[Solar panels that turn sunlight into electricity]{.underline}

[Wind turbines that use the wind to make power]{.underline}

[Hydropower that uses moving water to create electricity]{.underline}

Biomass produces electricity from plants and waste

Geothermal energy from deep inside the Earth

[Switching to these clean energy sources helps reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, slow global warming, and improve air quality. Renewable
electricity is also becoming more affordable as technology improves,
making it a viable option for more countries.]{.underline}

Some countries, like Germany and Costa Rica, now get most of their
electricity from renewable sources. In addition to cutting carbon
emissions, renewable energy can create jobs, reduce energy costs over
time, and improve energy security.

### Climate Change\-\--Impact\-\--2AC

#### Climate change causes extinction

Sciences, Dixie State University "Extinctions and climate change"
https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/environmental-sciences/extinctions-and-climate-change -

[Extinctions and climate change are closely linked, with historical
patterns showing that global warming has contributed to significant
species losses in the past.]{.underline} The phenomenon of mass
extinctions, defined by the loss of at least 30 percent of species, has
occurred multiple times throughout Earth's history, often driven by
complex environmental changes rather than a single cause. [Climate
change, through mechanisms such as habitat destruction, rising sea
levels, and increased temperatures, poses a significant threat to both
terrestrial and aquatic species. For instance, polar bears are
endangered by the reduction of winter ice, while warming oceans create
thermal stress for marine life and reduce oxygen levels, leading to
further extinctions.]{.underline}

[Modern extinction rates are alarming, with current estimates suggesting
they may be 50 to 100 times higher than background rates, primarily due
to human activity. This current wave of extinctions is unprecedented,
being the first mass extinction event primarily driven by biotic factors
related to human actions like habitat loss, pollution, and climate
change. Studies indicate that if global temperatures continue to rise,
the world could face a mass extinction, potentially affecting all
mammals**, including humans.**]{.underline} To address this crisis,
experts advocate for stronger environmental protections and preservation
efforts to safeguard endangered species and biodiversity. [Understanding
the interplay between climate change and extinctions is vital for
developing effective conservation strategies.]{.underline}

**REEs specific to Greenland key to aluminum production**

miner, he is also the author of many references including, "Colorado
Rock Hounding" and "New Mexico Rockhounding." CRYOLITE: "The Ice That
Never Melts" https://www.rockngem.com/cryolite-the-ice-that-never-melts
is 27

[Cryolite]{.underline} is something of an enigma among minerals. It [is
rare]{.underline}, [and its only significant deposit is located on the
remote coast of Greenland]{.underline}. Nevertheless, cryolite was once
of critical industrial and strategic importance. And it is the only
mineral that has ever been mined to commercial
extinction.[Cryolite,]{.underline} or sodium aluminum fluoride
(Na3AlF6), [consists of 12.85 percent aluminum]{.underline}, 54.30
percent fluorine, and 32.85 percent sodium. It crystallizes in the
monoclinic system, but occurs primarily in massive form. With a Mohs
hardness of 2.5 and a specific gravity of 2.98, cryolite is much softer
and a bit denser than quartz. Usually colorless, white or gray, it is
transparent to translucent and exhibits a vitreous-to-pearly
luster.Because its refractive index approximates that of water,
transparent, colorless cryolite becomes almost invisible when placed in
water. And cryolite is not only ice-like in appearance; its name, which
stems from the Greek words kryos, or "ice," and lithos, or "stone,"
means "ice stone." Greenland's indigenous Inuit called cryolite "the ice
that never melts." [Cryolite's sole commercial source is located at
Ivittuut (formerly Ivigtut) on Arsuk Fiord on Greenland's southwest
coast]{.underline}, where it occurs atop a granitic intrusion within a
mineralogically complex pegmatite that is the type locality for cryolite
and 16 other rare minerals.Also present in this pegmatite are
argentiferous galena, sphalerite, fluorite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and,
most notably, well-developed, reddish-brown crystals of siderite.After
studying specimens collected at Ivittuut, the Danish physician Peder
Christian Abildgaard described and named cryolite in 1799. Mining began
at Ivittuut in 1854, with cryolite first used as a minor source of
aluminum, then as a raw material for manufacturing caustic soda (sodium
hydroxide).[Metallurgists of the mid-1800s realized that strong,
lightweight aluminum had enormous industrial potential.]{.underline} But
the metal could only be extracted in small amounts from cryolite and
several other rare minerals. [Although aluminum was present in huge
quantities in alumina]{.underline} (aluminum oxide) in abundant
bauxite-type deposits, it could not be economically separated.But in
1884, A[merican and French chemists learned to dissolve alumina in
molten cryolite,]{.underline} then to inexpensively extract metallic
aluminum by electrolysis. [This discovery]{.underline}, patented as the
Hall-Héroult process, finally [made aluminum affordable.]{.underline}
[It also sharply boosted demand for cryolite]{.underline} which, for the
next 50 years, was critical in the development of the modern aluminum
industry.By 1900, the Ivittuut mine consisted of a steadily expanding
open pit, living quarters, machine shops, loading docks, a medical
clinic, and a 175-man crew."

[As the world moves toward an increasingly renewable future, aluminum is
helping to lead the way.]{.underline} According to a 2020 study by the
World Bank, [aluminum is the single most widely used mineral material in
solar photovoltaic (PV) applications.]{.underline} In fact, the metal
accounts for more than 85% of the mineral material demand for solar PV
components -- from frames to panels.[Aluminum extrusions are incredibly
versatile, making them a perfect option for solar panel
frame]{.underline}s. The metal can even improve solar cells themselves.
Using embedded aluminum studs can significantly increase solar panel
efficiency thanks to the material's unique reflectivity proper[ties.
Aluminum is also a critical component in other low carbon technologies
including wind, energy storage and hydroelectricity. The metal is used
widely in both on-shore and off-shore wind projects, including tower
platform components and turbines.]{.underline} And aluminum-ion
batteries have the potential to revolutionize energy storage systems.
According to the World Bank's analysis, [a robust effort to combat
climate change could more than double demand for aluminum by
2050]{.underline} compared to the base case scenario. Lightweight,
strong, durable, corrosion resistant and infinitely recyclable,
[aluminum builds a more sustainable structure]{.underline}. And with a
70+ year life span for some building products, it\'s a material that
will serve generations to come.The Aluminum Association has several
resources to support stakeholders\' use of aluminum as a sustainable
construction material. Whether you\'re wanting to know the Environmental
Product Declarations (EPDs) for various types of aluminum or if you\'re

#### Modern defense technology relies on Aluminium

#### Sheller 19 **Mimi Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University and the author of "Aluminum Dreams," from which this article is adapted.** "**The Uneasy Alliance Between Aluminum and Warfare".** **https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-uneasy-alliance-between-aluminum-and-warfare/**

[Aluminum has fascinated military strategists]{.underline} from its very
earliest days. Most histories of the metal begin by noting that French
emperor Napoleon III financed experiments by chemist Henri Étienne
Sainte-Claire Deville in the 1850s with the hope of developing light
helmets and armor for his cavalry, but it remained so expensive that all
he got was a breastplate for himself. However, with the establishment of
the modern industry, production soared, prices plunged, and as early as
1892 the French military ordered several aluminum torpedo boats."United
States cavalrymen fighting in the Spanish-American War," notes a history
of Alcoa Corporation, a major early producer of aluminum and the book's
publisher, "tethered their horses to aluminum picket pins, and infantry
troops slept in tents pegged to aluminum stakes," while Teddy Roosevelt
himself carried an aluminum canteen as he "led his troops up San Juan
Hill." However, these quaint details pale in comparison to the
subsequent military adoption of aluminum, which the company itself
described as "massive applications of aluminum to the terrible arena of
modern warfare," adding that it was its contributions to mobility and
speed that made aluminum so crucial both to perpetuating war and to
changing modern military strategy[.The aluminum industry helped to
modernize warfare, and warfare helped to modernize the aluminum
industry]{.underline}. As George David Smith writes in a different
history of the company, "war was good to Alcoa," with World War I
enabling the company to increase production by 40 percent and to export
ninety million pounds of Alcoa's total primary output (152 million
pounds between 1915 and 1918) to British, French, and Italian allies.
Smith notes that "plant facilities were hastily expanded to meet demand,
and shipments of bauxite from the company's new mines in South America
began in earnest." [In fact, during both World Wars I and II, about 90
percent of U.S. aluminum production went into military uses; the metal
remains essential to many components of modern warfare.]{.underline}It's
a central ingredient of BLU-82, known as the "daisy cutter," used for
carpet bombing Vietnam and more recently in the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Described as the world's largest non-nuclear weapon, it
contains a slurry of ammonium nitrate, aluminum powder, and a
polystyrene-based thickener, which when it explodes generates a massive
pressure wave estimated at 1,000 pounds per square inch.Our contemporary
culture of innovation and entrepreneurship remains deeply entwined with
the military-industrial complex.In addition to bombs, a host of small
arms make use of aluminum, including the M-72 light antitank weapon, the
M16 assault rifle, and the barrel of the M79 grenade launcher. Missiles,
meanwhile, make even more significant use of the light metal. The Hawk
missile "depends largely on aluminum for its speed and maneuverability"
according to Alcoa, and the Polaris missile requires 4000 pounds of the
light metal, not to mention a few more thousand pounds of aluminum in
powder form for its propellant mix. The Russian air-to-air R-27 missile,
as well as India's nuclear-capable Prithvi II, are also made of aluminum
alloys.Naval vessels, too, are heavily reliant on aluminum, which lends
them speed, range, and maneuverability. The Navy's destroyer-conversion
program used 200,000 to 700,000 pounds of aluminum per ship in order to
reduce the weight of deckhouses by up to 50 percent; whereas aircraft
carriers use millions of pounds of it. On a smaller scale, "lightning
speed and easy maneuverability are designed into 50-foot, all-aluminum
'Swifty' patrol craft," says Alcoa --- a ship many Americans know of
today in relation to the "Swift Boat" ads that may have helped bring
down John Kerry's presidential run in 2004. Perhaps a more surprising
use of aluminum during WWII was as a radar countermeasure in the form of
"chaff." Britain's Royal Air Force first used this secret new device,
code-named "Window," in its bombing of Hamburg in 1943. It consisted of
bundles of over two thousand strips of coarse black paper with aluminum
foil stuck on one side. Seven thousand bundles were dropped from a
stream of 740 Lancaster and Halifax bombers and they were so highly
successful in jamming Hamburg's defensive radar, that the entire warning
system was blinded: Hamburg was infamously reduced to ashes, and only
twelve British bombers were lost.It is fair to say that the entire
history of innovation and technical development in the uses of aluminum
was in many respects driven by the necessities of war, by aluminum's
terrible power for waging war, and by the intrigues, espionage, and
industrial maneuvering for military research funding and contracts
generated by war. This development led to what Eisenhower himself in
1961 warned was a dangerous "military-industrial complex" with
"unwarranted power" built in partnership with aluminum producers.Key
investor in Alcoa, Andrew Mellon, "left his job as Alcoa's Chief
Executive to become the US Treasury Secretary in 1921, and kept this
post for eleven years," according to Smith, the author of Alcoa's
history, "while his company expanded into Europe and Canada, buying
bauxite mines as well as factories and dam sites --- as one of the
world's first real multinationals." In other words, there were key ties
between the international expansion and vertical integration of the
industry, and the very heart of government. There were not only
interlocking directorates across companies like Alcoa and Alcan, a
Canadian aluminum manufacturer, but also linkages among the aluminum
industry, the highest levels of government, and the government funding
of warfare. [The international race to master aluminum technology was
intimately linked, then, with the race for military dominance in flight,
transport, weaponry, logistics, and eventually in aerospace and
satellite communications systems. Today, light metal continues to play a
critical role in defense.]{.underline} The U.S. Army Research Lab itself
points out that "aluminum alloy armor has been utilized by the US
government since the outbreak of World War II, and [each year, the
military procures about 5,000 vehicles, which translates to more than 30
million pounds of aluminum alloys that will be procured
annually]{.underline}." [It also continues to be a crucial material for
military-funded research and development, especially in regard to new
nanocomposites]{.underline}, including at the cutting-edge nanomaterials
engineering research facilities of my own employer, Drexel University in
Philadelphia.Our contemporary culture of innovation and entrepreneurship
remains deeply entwined with the military-industrial complex, with
serious implications for our ability to address ethical issues
concerning global pollution, environmental destruction, and the huge
effects of aluminum production on marginalized people.So long as
aluminum is crucial to the destructive capacities of warfare, [no amount
of greenwashing can hide its national military strategic significance
and geopolitical importance]{.underline}.The expansion of bauxite mining
and alumina refineries has had devastating environmental impacts around
the world, including especially dangerous recent spills of caustic "red
mud" and water contamination affecting Indigenous and Quilombolas
communities in Brazil; an environmental struggle in Jamaica to save its
interior Cockpit Country from mining (about which I have co-produced,
with Jamaican Director and Producer Esther Figueroa, a forthcoming
documentary film called "Fly Me to the Moon"); major legal battles
against Vedanta, which operates mines and factories in India and Zambia,
for pollution and human rights abuses against tribal peoples; and a 2019
oil spill by a bauxite shipping tanker on Rennell Island, a remote
Pacific coral atoll and World Heritage Site, where bauxite mining
operations have "gouged red gashes and left gaping holes in the forest"
while shadowed "by allegations of rampant corruption, deception of
landowners and regulatory violations," according to the New York
Times.This is all standard operating practice for an industry that has
scoured the world for weak spots where environmentally lax mining could
take hold and governments could be corrupted for corporate advantage.
The ethical concerns are further magnified when corporations proclaim
that they are operating in the interests of "sustainability" by creating
materials for "green" solutions. As Olúfẹmi O. Táíwò recently argued in
Pacific Standard, even Green New Deal supporters should beware of
"climate colonialism" in which initiatives to slow global warming and
build "green" economies lead to the domination of less powerful
countries and taking of resources, land, and energy. So long as aluminum
is crucial to the destructive capacities of warfare, no amount of
greenwashing can hide its national military strategic significance and
geopolitical importance.In 1950, the Reynolds Metals Company observed
that our bombs over Germany were doubled in power through the use of
aluminum powder. "[Truly, the possibilities of the magic metal,
aluminum," they keenly observed, "are just beginning to be explored."
The future undoubtedly will reveal many more.]{.underline}

[China's]{.underline} state-sponsored industrial [policies]{.underline},
financing, and tax incentives [have led to **considerable political
leverage** worldwide over the **raw materials** required for
**semiconductor manufacturing**]{.underline}; the country [has
positioned itself as the dominant supplier of raw material inputs for
cutting-edge technology. Supply chains are **fragile**]{.underline},
especially for an industry characterized by its complexity, high-level
expertise, and specialized [manufacturing chains]{.underline} that
[cross international borders **several times** and depend on inputs from
**multiple private businesses**]{.underline} and trusted suppliers.
[**Self-sufficiency**]{.underline} in the semiconductor industry is
impractical and highly unlikely, but it [is possible and desirable to
**diminish risks** and increase resiliency. U.S]{.underline}. allies in
the Western Hemisphere are crucial for this undertaking, and the United
States should look at all segments of the value chain for the region,
not just at assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP).

Reliance on China as a Strategic Vulnerability

The [semiconductor industry is expected to be worth **\$1 trillion
annually** by 2030. Increased demand for semiconductors]{.underline},
especially those at the cutting edge of advanced design and capability,
[will require **greater quantities** and **new varieties** of minerals
and metals of **all types**. China's]{.underline}
concentration---bordering on [monopoly]{.underline}---[of supply and
production of critical minerals creates a **vulnerability**, leaving the
industry **exposed** to supply chain disruptions]{.underline}. The
International Energy Agency claims that [China maintains **60 percent**
of the world's rare earth mining production and approximately **90
percent** of processing and refining.]{.underline} The West's [reliance
on China's minerals poses **worrisome risks** of supply
shocks]{.underline} and China exercising its leverage over prices. A
[secure supply of critical minerals for the semiconductor industry
is]{.underline} not only necessary for the private sector but also [a
**concern** for national security and defense]{.underline}; since 2020,
[the United States has recognized it has no domestic production of
14]{.underline} of the [minerals]{.underline} on the critical minerals
list [and is "**completely dependent** on imports to supply its
demand."]{.underline}

A detailed understanding of the risks associated with each material
involved in semiconductor production is crucial to appreciating and
measuring vulnerability. Dependence on China varies considerably for
each critical mineral. Moreover, vulnerability should not be calculated
merely by possible manipulations of supply but rather by the mineral's
sensitivity to price shifts; the availability of stockpiles, alternative
suppliers, and substitute materials; and how quickly alternative
production could be brought online.

China's Actions

China is highly reliant on chip imports from its geopolitical rivals to
drive its domestic design and production. Aware of this vulnerability in
its tech sector, [the PRC has **pursued policies** to become more
**self-reliant** in the semiconductor industry]{.underline}. In part,
this national effort is spurred by the "information innovation" project,
launched in 2016 and expanded significantly in 2022, and [aims to
**reduce dependence** on technology suppliers from abroad.]{.underline}

In 2014, [the PRC released a policy addressing semiconductors as a
**core technology**]{.underline}. The "Guidelines to Promote National
Integrated Circuit Industry Development" indicate "the goal of
establishing a world-leading semiconductor industry in all areas of the
integrated circuit supply chain by 2030." As a stated objective, the
strategy includes meeting 70 percent of the PRC's semiconductor demand
through domestic production by 2025. In response to U.S. efforts to
build a multinational coalition to restrict its access to advanced
semiconductor manufacturing technology, China [increased its imports of
lithography machines used to **imprint circuits** in silicon
wafers]{.underline} by 450 percent in December 2023.

[Responding to new U.S. **export controls** on chip
manufacturing]{.underline} technology in October 2022 and additional
controls in October 2023, [the PRC has]{.underline} also [increased
subsidies to boost the domestic semiconductor
industry]{.underline}---totaling an estimated \$150 billion in the past
decade. In March 2023, Huawei and the Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corporation (SMIC) spearheaded a technology initiative
that managed to produce new chips "at the advanced 7-nanometer (nm)
technology node" for the Mate60 Pro smartphone; SMIC, a partially
state-owned company, is allegedly capable of creating 5 nm chips, though
likely not yet at industrial scale. This has raised questions in the
U.S. government about the effectiveness of technology export controls
since China has nevertheless advanced in the semiconductor industry. For
example, Beijing has prioritized "tool and material production lines
free of Western inputs" and new approaches to lay out public-private
collaboration to enhance innovation, mostly in advanced lithography
technology. Yet despite the narrowing gap in technological advancement,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) continues to outpace
its PRC competitors and rivals, as it has been producing 3 nm chips at
industrial scale since 2022.

In addition, again as a direct response to U.S. export controls, [the
PRC has **leveraged** its dominance in the early stages of supply chains
to **restrict exports** of gallium, germanium, and graphite, which are
essential to high-performance chips]{.underline}. In July 2023, alleging
national security concerns, China announced the restrictions, which took
the form of licensing requirements that mandate exporters first apply
for permission from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. [Rather
than]{.underline} outright [banning exports, China would]{.underline}
therefore [be able to **selectively increase or decrease** the flow of
gallium and germanium to world markets.]{.underline} While gallium
exports remain at historic lows, the [PRC has]{.underline} seemingly not
[sought to c**hoke off** U.S. access]{.underline} to the metal ª taking
a "presumption of approval" approach to licensing exports. However,
concerns persist that this could rapidly switch to a "presumption of
denial" for gallium and a host of other minerals and technologies.

The United States Responds

In September 2020, the Trump administration recognized in an executive
order that "America cannot be dependent on imports from foreign
adversaries for the critical minerals that are increasingly necessary to
maintain our economic and military strength in the 21st century." The
United States has further recognized the supply chain vulnerabilities
and geopolitical risks of its dependence on China for critical minerals,
with the Biden administration clamping down on China's access to
advanced chip technology and imposing export restrictions intended to
flag its military advancement. Part of this acknowledgment was
spearheaded by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, signed into law by
President Joe Biden that August and designed to boost U.S. investment
and development. Two months later, the Department of Commerce's Bureau
of Industry and Security (BIS) imposed trade restrictions to cap China's
access to the most advanced semiconductors by limiting access to design
capability and manufacturing, blocking expert assistance, scrutinizing
investments, or narrowing licensing. The restrictions were
"substantially tightened" in October 2023 with measures such as
preventing circumvention efforts through subsidiary companies, adding
items to the list of manufacturing equipment for chips, or blacklisting
companies "to which the export of certain technology is prohibited."
Most recently, the Department of Commerce revoked the licenses that
major U.S. chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm relied upon to export
semiconductors to Huawei. Establishing export controls to halt the
advance of Chinese technology companies is a tactic intended to work in
tandem with the stimulus of domestic manufacturing and nearshoring.
Alongside the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
(IRA) sought to catalyze a reorientation of mineral supply chains away
from China and toward the United States and other like-minded countries
in the Western Hemisphere through tax credits and subsidies.

Another policy to address the United States' unsustainable vulnerability
is the entry into force of the Minerals Security Partnership, a
strategic, U.S.-led alliance that endeavors to diversify the sources of
mineral supply. The interconnectedness of semiconductor supply chains
has emphasized that the partnership is not comprehensive enough,
especially because it does not include "key mineral producers" in the
Western Hemisphere such as Argentina and Brazil. Reducing risks in
supply chains is challenging, and regulatory and practical obstacles
exist among Western allies. For example, just in the United States, the
challenge of U.S. higher labor costs vis-à-vis competitors is one of the
barriers to relocating industry.

Surveying the Bottlenecks and Defining "Disruption Potential"

While China's dominance over critical mineral supply chains has prompted
concern from several corners of the U.S. government and private sector,
understanding the nature of the threat is not entirely straightforward.
Wielding coercive power through export restrictions, even when those
exports are going toward an industry as globally important as
semiconductors, is no easy task. Export restrictions are a blunt tool,
and both governments and companies are more likely to adapt than cave to
political pressures, at least if adaptation is possible in the short
term.

The case of neon gas is especially instructive in this regard. Used as a
buffer in the lasers responsible for the deep- and extreme-ultraviolet
lithography responsible for advanced chipmaking, the neon industry was
highly concentrated in Russia and Ukraine until recently. Moscow's
full-scale invasion in February 2022 brought neon production in both
countries to a crawl, cutting off as much as 40--50 percent of global
supply. Neon gas prices subsequently surged, alongside those of other
rare gases such as xenon and krypton, which also depended heavily on
Ukrainian and Russian sources. Notably, however, this did not bring
about a significant market distortion in the semiconductor industry,
where major producers were able to employ existing reserves and adapt
their lithography processes to use less neon. Just a year later, neon
prices had practically returned to their prewar levels.

While the neon shortage was an unintentional consequence of Russia's
revisionist foreign policy, even premeditated attempts to deploy
critical minerals as a weapon in geopolitical competition can backfire
on their wielders. One CSIS study found that in many cases, China's
attempts at economic coercion have proven counterproductive to Beijing's
strategic aims. In 2010, after a Chinese fishing vessel collided with
the Japanese coast guard off the disputed Senkaku Islands, the PRC
halted rare earth element (REE) exports to Japan. In response, the
Japanese government created a budget of \$1.2 billion devoted to
mitigating its dependence on Chinese REEs. This fund supported
investment in the use of alternative materials, recycling and
stockpiling of REEs, and acquiring a stake in REE mines in friendly
countries such as Australia.

[Past success]{.underline} at thwarting China's economic coercion [does
not mean the **U**nited **S**tates and its allies should be
**cavalier**]{.underline} about the ability to adapt should China's
posture change from its current presumption of approval to a presumption
of denial for exporting critical minerals. To the contrary, [governments
and chip manufacturers need to use a more **fine-grained** approach when
surveying vulnerabilities]{.underline} in their mineral supply chains.
Rather than looking at market dominance alone, "disruption potential"
serves as a more promising standard. This framework was originally used
by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to synthesize the United States'
dependency on imports for a particular mineral and the estimated
economic value that mineral provides. Applied to semiconductor
manufacturing, inputs with the highest disruption potential are defined
as those for which supply is highly concentrated in China and for which
there are few to no readily available substitutes or alternative
suppliers. The subsequent section evaluates five materials according to
this definition of disruption potential: gallium, germanium, fluorine,
arsenic, and copper.

This list is illustrative, not comprehensive. It encompasses elements
that are common to virtually all semiconductors, such as fluorine and
copper, as well as those needed for specialty chips. [Gallium,
germanium, and arsenic in particular are **widespread** among the
semiconductors serving **national defense** functions]{.underline},
including missile defense radars, high-frequency radio, and satellite
communications. However, a more fulsome accounting is necessary to map
the expansive supply chain for semiconductor minerals.

The tech Cold War

The [US and China\'s moves to **outmaneuver each other** in the tech
race have some analysts drawing parallels to the Cold War]{.underline}.

Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on
Foreign Relations, told Business Insider the idea that the US ought to
out-compete China and prevent the nation from developing advanced chips
plays into a \"bigger power competition narrative.\"

She said the [tensions are **similar,**]{.underline} though not
identical, to the tensions between the US and Soviet Union that began
after the end of World War II.

As Bloomberg reported last month, the US is considering limiting export
licenses for both Nvidia and AMD chips in an unfolding trade war that
has also hit several sensitive industries, including electric vehicles,
batteries, and some solar panels.

The US imposed similar trade limits, embargoes, and economic sanctions
on the Soviet Union, North Korea, China, and North Vietnam during the
Cold War.

\"I think the [heart of the issue is **concern** about how China will
use AI chips for **military applications** and
**surveillance**]{.underline},\" Chris Tang, a UCLA professor and expert
in global supply chain management and the impact of regulatory policies,
told BI. \"It\'s a different type of Cold War.\"

Beyond a tense relationship, the [dynamics between the US and China
are]{.underline} also [creating **parallel systems**,]{.underline} with
the US and its allies on one side, and China and its allies on the
other, Nick Vyas, the founding director of USC Marshall\'s Randall R.
Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute, told BI.

Vyas said he\'s concerned the [tension could **escalate**
from]{.underline} this new [Cold War to a **hot one** between **global
powers.**]{.underline}

\"When we stop transacting horizontally with each other, that\'s only
creating a larger conflict,\" Vyas said. \"And then [with a **S**outh
**C**hina **S**ea conflict, the geopolitical conflict could
turn]{.underline} into a [larger]{.underline} conflict, which can [lead
to a **major situation** that leads up to a war]{.underline}.\"

Representatives for Nvidia declined to comment for this story.
Representatives for AMD and the Bureau of Industry and Security didn\'t
respond to requests for comment from BI.

Can China Retaliate?

The United States may lead in cutting-edge semiconductor tech, but
[China **has sway** in]{.underline} other key areas in the semiconductor
supply chain---mainly, [rare earth elements that are **must-haves** for
making chips. China extracts **60 percent** of the world's rare earth
minerals and handles over **85 percent** of processing]{.underline}. In
response to US export controls, China has restricted gallium and
germanium exports to signal its displeasure. While China hasn't fully
weaponized its rare earth resources yet, it's hinting at the possibility
of doing so in the future.

Smartphones contain twenty to forty chips, mostly older "mature node"
types handling essential functions like memory and charging. While
cutting-edge processors grab headlines, these less glamorous chips are
equally vital to device performance. [China currently controls around 24
percent of **global capacity** for 50--180 nm chips, and this share is
projected to surge to 50 percent by 2030]{.underline} as China pours
massive subsidies into mature node manufacturing. [Many **raise the
concern** that Chinese state-run chipmakers could **flood the
market**]{.underline} with foundational chips, [**wreaking havoc** on
chipmakers' share of the industry]{.underline}. For this reason, the
Biden administration recently announced a plan to increase tariffs on
semiconductors from 25 percent to 50 percent by 2025, and the US
Department of Commerce has already taken steps to survey US
semiconductor firms for reliance on mature nodes. These steps are a move
in the right direction, proactively addressing potential vulnerabilities
while maintaining a competitive edge in the semiconductor market.

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece. [The **era**

breakers which accompany any transit as patrol vessels. In 2024, the
Kremlin is planning to commence year-round navigations of the route,
through which it hopes to increase the amount of cargo shipped from
around 30 million annually to 80 million.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which has ominously [[declared
itself]{.mark} a "**near-[Arctic]{.mark}** [state]{.mark}"]{.underline}
--- also harbours ambitions to transform the passage into a silk road of
the far north, while in March, a Russian delegation to India held talks
over new co-operation over the route. [The [**West**
is]{.mark}]{.underline} similarly [flexing its muscles,]{.underline}
with **[Finland]{.underline}** (and the expected accession of Sweden)
[[extending **NATO's** borders]{.underline}]{.mark} into the Arctic. In
June, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced that the US
would be opening an outpost in the far-north Norwegian town of Tromsø,
stressing the need to have "a diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic
Circle. "[The war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} has really
[[torpedoed]{.underline}]{.mark} this idea of [[Arctic
**exceptionalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}," explains Dr Neil Melvin,
Director of International Security at the Royal United Services
Institute (RUSI). "The whole focus of northern Europe has basically now
shifted to building security against Russia."

As Melvin points out, [the]{.underline} heavy losses [sustained by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s land army in [Ukraine will **force** it
to become [increasingly **reliant** on]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear force**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} stationed [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the UK and US have also long
operated their own attack submarines. Russia's Northern Fleet comprises
of a dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle cruisers. In
recent years, Russia has also reoccupied old Cold War-era Arctic bases
to bolster its presence. "[They will feel more
**vulnerable**]{.underline} as a result of not having a strong army,
[and]{.underline} I think we are likely to see them [[**threaten**
nuclear]{.mark} options]{.underline} much more as part of national
defence," Melvin says of Russia's designs in the Arctic. "[They are
going to be much more **explicit** and threatening]{.underline}."

Beneath the ice, the Arctic possesses untold riches. The region is
estimated to contain a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas
reserves and rare earth elements such as gold, nickel and zinc. While
most of these are present within the largely undisputed land borders of
the Arctic nations, it is the [increasingly navigable international
**waters**]{.underline} that [present the most likely
**flashpoint**]{.underline}. An ongoing process led by a United Nations
commission is considering sovereignty rights to the central Arctic Ocean
between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin is cooperating with the
process so far, he has also planted a flag in the most literal sense ---
dropping a titanium standard of the Russian Federation two miles beneath
the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007. Fishing rights are also key;
as southern oceans heat up, species will migrate ever further north,
causing estimated catches in higher latitudes to increase by up to 20
per cent by 2050.

According to Professor Klaus Dodds, an expert in geopolitics and ice
studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the recent book, Border
Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could prove another area of
conflict. Under a treaty originally signed in 1920, a host of countries
including China and Russia have rights to engage in commercial
activities across Svalbard. Moscow conducts coal mining operations on
the island of Spitsbergen (and insists on referring to Svalbard by the
same name, to emphasise its historic claim on the land). In settlements
such as Barentsburg, Russian is the predominant language.

"The concern is we know we have [potential **flashpoints** like
[Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline} which, having caused agitation and
tension in the past, might be [**[escalate]{.mark}**d very
**[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Dodds says. Aggression could be
anything from [[attacks on]{.mark} underwater
**[cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} (last year, a Russian trawler was
linked to the severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic cable which linked
Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland), [to]{.underline} an outright
[attack on oil and gas **[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "The
Norwegian European Arctic will be the space where, if anything, this is
most likely to happen," Dodds says. "That [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[be]{.mark} the ultimate **opportunity** for Russia to test
**NATO**'s resolve]{.underline}."

Regardless of the [potential for **[nuclear]{.mark}**
conflict]{.underline}, a burning Arctic poses grave threats for
humanity. The Arctic permafrost contains peatland soils which are the
world's most vital carbon sink. Globally, peatlands store twice as much
carbon as all the forests combined. When this burns, it releases the
carbon back into the atmosphere creating something of a doom loop.
According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, wildfires
across Canada have released 290 megatons of carbon into the atmosphere
between January and August, more than 25% of the global total for 2023
in the year to date.

Thawing permafrost is also exposing chemical and radioactive waste and
millennia-old "zombie viruses". In 2016, around 100,000 reindeer were
culled in the Russian far north after an anthrax outbreak that killed a
12-year-old boy. Plague bacillus, smallpox and other historic diseases
are also feared to soon re-emerge from the melting earth. The discovery
earlier this summer of 46,000-year-old roundworms lying dormant in
Siberia, which are happily reproducing once again, may hold clues for
adapting to climate change --- but they also raise questions about what
else might venture forth in a thaw. And herein lies [the **great
lesson** of]{.underline} the [far north]{.underline}, Professor Dodds
explains: nothing here ever happens in isolation --- [[there will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} wider [[**ramifications** across the
**globe**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Change in the Arctic is never
restricted to the Arctic itself," he says. "It is almost as if the
Arctic strikes back."

The time is long gone where we could think of [the
**Arctic**]{.underline} as a great pristine wilderness. Instead it has
become the burning crucible of our climate crisis. But, as the towering
glaciers melt and the seas of the Earth's fifth largest ocean are
revealed to us at last, their future looks even darker still,
[reanimating]{.underline} the [**bio**logical threats]{.underline} of
our deep past, and [providing]{.underline} yet another [site
for]{.underline} human competition and **[conquest]{.underline}**.

Norway\'s Role in the NATO Alliance,"

[[Because of]{.mark} its [**geography**, Norway\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}
security has always [been intimately [**tied** to control of]{.mark} the
**[North]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Norwegian [[Seas,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} of the associated
[[airspace]{.underline}]{.mark}. A history of occupation and liberation
places additional importance on [[securing]{.mark} wider lines of
**[communications]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the sea lanes across
the Atlantic [which are [**arterial** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Alliance.

Since the days of the Cold War, [**Russian** plans for]{.underline} any
future [war]{.underline} with NATO have [recognized the need to
**interdict** the flow]{.underline} of American and Canadian troops and
materiel [across the **Atlantic**]{.underline}. Given its strategic
position on NATO\'s northern flank, [[Norway has]{.mark} an
[**essential** role]{.mark} to play]{.underline} alongside U.S. and
British forces in securing the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GUIK) and Bear
(Svalbard--North Cape) gaps---[preventing Russia from
projecting]{.underline} naval and air [power]{.underline} into the North
Atlantic.

[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark} also [needs to
[monitor]{.mark}]{.underline} growing [[hybrid
**threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the country\'s territorial waters
and exclusive economic zone. [This includes]{.underline} new [threats
[to]{.mark} the **subsea** infrastructure]{.underline} essential to
Norway\'s economy and modern way of life, [such as
[underwater]{.mark}]{.underline} data **[[cables]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
electricity interconnectors, and oil and gas pipelines. [[Such]{.mark}
infrastructure [is increasingly **vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline},
given Russia\'s advanced undersea warfare capabilities, as well as the
proliferation of uncrewed underwater systems, smart mines, and other
technologies. [[There are]{.underline}]{.mark} also ongoing [[hybrid
**threats**]{.mark} to Norway\'s remote]{.underline} northern
[territories]{.underline}, including those [arising from **Russian**
activities [around **Finnmark**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as GPS
jamming and airspace incursions, [[or]{.mark} provocations
around]{.underline} the **[[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark}** archipelago.

[Amidst]{.underline} growing [militarisation of the **polar**
region]{.underline}, and with melting sea ice making Arctic waters and
the Northern Sea Route increasingly navigable in summer months, the
Norwegian Armed Forces also face new requirements for operations in
extreme cold conditions. Crucially, even if the risks of a military
conflict starting in the High North remain comparatively low, [the
region\'s strategic **significance** as Russia\'s]{.underline} defensive
**[bastion]{.underline}** and the home of its nuclear-armed submarines
and North Sea Fleet [means it would quickly be pulled into]{.underline}
any [conflict]{.underline} sparked elsewhere.

Facing growing threats from the North, [[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}
thus [[represents]{.mark} the [**first line** of]{.mark} defence for
NATO]{.underline}. Here, then, the planned acquisition of new
submarines, anti-submarine warfare frigates, mine-countermeasure
capabilities, and uncrewed systems all align with this role. Such
[enhanced **capabilities** will]{.underline} not only boost Norway\'s
own defence, but also help the U.S., UK, and other NATO navies [ensure
[a]{.mark} credible [**deterrent** in the]{.mark}]{.underline} North
Atlantic, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, and [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The 2024 LTP also increases [Norway\'s capacity for **intel**ligence
gathering]{.underline}, including through space-based capabilities. This
offers increased reach, coverage, and remote monitoring of some of
Norway\'s less accessible territory and waters. It also [reduces
**reliance** on U.S. capabilities]{.underline} at a time when the
American military\'s attention is increasingly pulled toward the
Indo-Pacific.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

While the latest LTP directs much of the new spending towards the navy
and army, this partly reflects the fact that the Norwegian Air Force was
the main beneficiary of previous iterations of the plan. Norway is
already bringing online its new F-35 stealth fighter and P-8 Poseidon
maritime patrol aircraft, offering a major boost to the country\'s
intelligence-gathering and strike capabilities. The 2024 LTP\'s
commitment to invest more in uncrewed systems like long-range aerial
drones offers a chance to build on these recent acquisitions by
exploiting the benefits of new technologies---including the increased
mass from lower-cost drones. However, few Western militaries have yet
incorporated these new technologies fully into their arsenals. At the
same time, Sweden and Finland have joined NATO and all four Nordic
countries have agreed to integrate their air forces more closely. This
offers new opportunities to enhance the defence of the North Calotte
region especially and of the combined Nordic airspaces more broadly.
Finland is soon acquiring the F-35A to replace its ageing F/A-18
fighters. There are also new efficiencies to be derived from three of
the four Nordic air forces operating and maintaining the same aircraft
type. Conversely, the need to integrate the F-35A with Sweden\'s JAS-39
Gripen fleet also offers Norway a chance to be at the forefront of
shaping NATO\'s wider efforts to get the most out of fourth and fifth
generation aircraft. Steadfast Supporter With comparatively small armed
forces, and a large territory to defend, Norway\'s defence also hinges
on receiving and supporting Allied reinforcements in a crisis. This was
already recognised as a key priority in the previous LTP and in RAND\'s
2020 study for the Norwegian ministry of defence. Both emphasised
revitalising Norway\'s capacity for host nation support. This includes
investment in infrastructure such as airbases, ports, and secure
locations for pre-positioned U.S. military equipment---much of which was
overlooked in the decades following the Cold War. Sweden and Finland
joining NATO means that the military geography of the Nordic region has
shifted. While reception, staging, and onward integration of Allied
reinforcements is still vital to Norwegian defence and security, it is
likely that any future conflict with Russia would involve direct attacks
by Russian forces on Norway\'s neighbours, requiring Norway to help NATO
project power eastward. Even Norway\'s own border with Russia could be
contested, in which case the trilateral cooperation with Sweden and
Finland will provide support. In particular, Finland\'s new membership
of NATO has greatly increased the Alliance\'s land border with Russia.
It has also placed the strategically important Russian military bases
and lines of communication on the Kola Peninsula within long-range fires
from Finnish territory. Similarly, the Swedish island of Gotland offers
a vital launchpad for operations in the Baltic Sea. In both cases,
Russia would want to push back NATO forces further from its own
territory in any future conflict, meaning the newest entrants into the
Atlantic Alliance are likely to be priority targets for air and missile
strikes, and possibly for land incursions too. Finland is now
responsible for much of NATO\'s front line in the north of Europe, and
Sweden is emerging as a key logistical hub for moving troops and
supplies to Finland and across to the Baltic States. Norway will be key
to strategic depth and enabling NATO activities in the wider region. As
Sweden is starting to think about what NATO membership means, it looks
to both east and west, to aid in defence of both Finnmark and Finland.
Common command and control links would enable long-range precision fires
to be directed from Sweden and Finland, munitions to be interchangeable,
and newly acquired ISTAR drones to have the capability to share
information with allies. Here, the establishment of a new Brigade South,
and the acquisition of long-range air defence systems, helps to secure
Norwegian airbases and ports for importing troops and equipment and
pushing them east. The expanded Home Guard can provide further
protection to logistic and staging infrastructure. Collaboration and
mutual exercises between Swedish and Norwegian forces can facilitate
smooth troop transport across the borders when required. Expanding and
mechanising the Army will similarly provide valuable Norwegian
reinforcements to Sweden and Finland if needed, while investment in
long-range fires and new ISTAR capabilities will increase Norway\'s
ability to provide rear-echelon fire support. The scale of the challenge
may not be appreciated by all, however. For Norway, upgrading the
infrastructure needed to support staging and receiving from both east
and west, and the flow of assets south to north, will be costly and take
many years to implement, not least given the difficult terrain in rural
areas. To maximise the coordination of activities in the Nordic
countries, NATO should continue to investigate the most efficient
command and control arrangements for the region. It must be conscious of
the current division of Norway, Sweden, and Finland between two separate
Joint Forces Commands in Brunssum and Norfolk, VA. This appears
suboptimal.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

Crucially, too, the war in Ukraine has shown that future conflicts may
not be the swift (if bloody) affairs long envisaged by many defence
planners in NATO countries. Rather, Norway must be ready for a
protracted conflict, possibly with reduced American support. This
entails a growing need for capabilities to conduct sustained combat
operations, including in harsh and remote environments where Norway
already has experience, but not on the scale that would be needed in
future. An increase in army resources for Finnmark is a positive first
step, but further actions could be required to sustain and supply these
resources long-term. There is similarly a need to ensure that
[[**Norway** has]{.mark} sufficient underlying defence industrial
[**capacity** to surge **production** in]{.mark}]{.underline} times of
[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as to revitalise the Cold
War--era Total Defence concept to bolster the resilience of Norway\'s
society, economy, and civilian population, including against
cyberthreats.

Threat-Driven Capability Development

To anchor and strengthen the NATO roles outlined above, Norway should
also focus on accelerating the development and acquisition of innovative
new capabilities for its military, as well as bolstering the technology,
industrial, and skills bases needed to deliver them.

Even if it is impossible to foresee what the threat will look like in 10
to 15 years from now, some [trends [based on **current**]{.mark} and
past **[behaviours]{.mark}**]{.underline} and stated ambitions can be
observed and [should be considered. **Hybrid [threats]{.mark}** to
**c**ritical **i**nfrastructure [are]{.mark}]{.underline} bound [[to
persist]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as subthreshold threats to target
national and societal resilience. Observations from the battlefields of
Ukraine show

[increasing [duels between **u**]{.mark}]{.underline}ncrewed
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**erial **[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**ystems and
their countermeasures;

[the deadly and **[asymmetric]{.mark}** threats]{.underline} posed [by
**[uncrewed]{.mark}**]{.underline} surface and [underwater
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} to traditional naval platforms;

the vital importance of **[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**lectronic
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**arfare and countermeasures, long overlooked
by most Western militaries;

the increasing ease of [hacking or jamming
**[satellite]{.mark}**]{.underline} service**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**;

the impact of long-range fires, combined with pervasive ISTAR
capabilities and **[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**-[enhanced **c**ommand
a**n**d **c**ontrol]{.underline} tools, in forcing military units to
disperse, dig in, and conceal themselves to survive.

[[Through **Nordic** cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} and
interoperability, [current capability [**gaps** can]{.mark}]{.underline}
begin to **[[close]{.underline}]{.mark}** and new ones can be tackled
together.

A [**bad example** in tackling **climate change**]{.underline}

Whatever one thinks of the theories of human origin of the climate
change, and the consequent need to reduce human productive activities to
counter it, [[countries]{.mark} in the world have [**committed**
to]{.mark} **n**ationally **d**etermined **c**ontributions]{.underline}
(NDCs) [to reduce]{.underline} their [**g**reen**h**ouse **g**as
emissions as part of]{.underline} climate change
**[[mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The [[PRC's]{.mark} **NDC** is [not very
**ambitious**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the country is likely to meet or
exceed it, which would [allow]{.underline} the [party-state to
[use]{.mark} the [results for **propaganda**]{.mark}]{.underline}
purposes both at home and abroad. [Beijing is not likely to **commit**
itself to]{.underline} more serious [emissions
**reductions**]{.underline} targets in the future. Such a commitment
would in fact cause a high risk of losing face in case of failing to
reach the target.

China's NDC is **[[insufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}** in [[to]{.mark}
reach the goal of **[limiting]{.mark}** the global
[temperature]{.mark}]{.underline} rise to 2°C that was decided at the
Paris Climate Accords, the international treaty that was signed in 2016
and is commonly known as "The Paris Agreement." Simply put, [unless
other states do not **implement** much more ambitious
**emissions**]{.underline} reductions measures, [the PRC's **[poor
record]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the topic [will]{.underline} frustrate
and [[**jeopardize** the whole attempt]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In particular, [**Beijing** has not indicated how much its emissions
will **grow**]{.underline} before they peak. In 2015, a number of
[**Arctic Council** observer states **submitted**]{.underline}, on a
voluntary basis, their [national **reports**]{.underline} on enhanced
black carbon and methane emissions reductions, including France, Japan,
Poland, Spain, Korea, India, Italy, and the European Union (EU). But
[not the **PRC**]{.underline}.

[Beijing's]{.underline} role as an emitter of greenhouse gases,
including short-lived climate forcers, is part of the country's broader
[[**environmental footprint** in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Chinese actors may [[affect]{.mark} Arctic
**[habitats]{.mark}**]{.underline} more directly [[through]{.mark} the
[**investments** of Chinese]{.mark} companies [in]{.mark} places such as
**[Greenland]{.mark}**]{.underline}, northern [Canada]{.underline}, [or
Siberia]{.underline}. [Chinese [demand for
**resources**]{.mark}]{.underline} [is the key contributor
to]{.underline} the [**[extract]{.mark}**ive industries investment
**[potential]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Arctic. For instance, in
2013, the PRC imported more than 60% of the international iron ore
trade. The country accounted for 44% of global nickel demand in 2011.
Beijing is a major and growing market for pulp derived from boreal
forests. Moreover, Chinese [[**shipping** activities have marine and
air]{.mark} **environmental** [impacts]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Arctic, which are [bound to increase with **growing
traffic**]{.underline}.

In other words, the **[[PRC]{.underline}]{.mark}** largely [[contributes
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the environmental problems of the Arctic, most
conspicuously through the impacts of **[[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [but [also]{.mark}]{.underline} through
[other **[pollutants]{.mark}**]{.underline} that end up in the Arctic.
Moreover, [the country [does not **participate** in]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[**Arctic Council** Working Group]{.mark} on **b**lack **c**arbon
and **methane**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} could
[[present]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} contribution to
**addressing**]{.underline} the [[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} of
climate change (again, whatever one may think of it) in the North. Part
of the [**b**lack **c**arbon]{.underline} that is
[deposited]{.underline} there [has its origins in China]{.underline}.
[[**Beijing** is]{.underline}]{.mark} in sum part of [[the

Despite its seemingly desolate landscape, [[the **Arctic** hosts an
astounding **diversity** of species]{.underline}]{.mark} and habitats,
and [[represents]{.mark} one of the most [**unique** ecosystems]{.mark}
on the planet]{.underline}. [It [is **critically

**bio**logical]{.underline}, [**chem**ical and **physical
[balance]{.mark}** [of the globe]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arctic
biodiversity [[underpins **planetary** health]{.mark} and

and benefits on which [[we all **depend**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Dr.
Braulio F. de Souza Dias says The Arctic Biodiversity Assessment,
recently launched by Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF), the
biodiversity working group of the Arctic Council, has made it very clear
that Arctic biodiversity is being degraded.

Climate change is by far the most serious threat to Arctic biodiversity,
exacerbating other threats such as ocean acidification, habitat
degradation, pollution and, in some areas, unsustainable harvesting. The
[[loss of **biod**]{.mark}iversity]{.underline} is expected to

Nearly 40 years ago, [scientists sounded the alarm that
**emissions**]{.underline} of industrial chemicals [called
**[c]{.mark}**hloro**[f]{.mark}**luoro**[c]{.mark}**arbon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(CFCs) were eating a hole in the earth's ozone layer, [[**exposing** the
planet to]{.underline} [harmful]{.underline}]{.mark} levels of
**[[radiation]{.underline}]{.mark}** from space. The international
community responded quickly to enact a ban on CFCs called the Montreal
Protocol. It went into effect in 1989 and was universally ratified by
197 countries, including every member of the United Nations, as well as
the European Union. It curbed emissions and was declared a major
success.

However, in 2013, the trend turned around---slowly at first, but then
faster. In June 2019, an international team of scientists published
findings in Nature showing evidence that CFC-11 is being emitted by
polluters in the Shandong and Hebei provinces in Northeastern China.
When confronted by the EIA last year, 18 different Chinese companies
made no effort to hide their use of CFCs, and the Chinese government
appears to be willing to turn a blind eye to this illegal activity.
Without domestic enforcement of the regulations in China, the
accomplishments of the Montreal Protocol are in jeopardy.

Recently, the Washington Post reported that Chinese telecom giant Huawei
teamed with the Chinese state-owned firm Panda Group to obscure its
trade and dealings with North Korea, in violation of U.N. sanctions and
U.S. export control measures. These incidents follow the U.S. Department
of Commerce blacklisting Huawei for partnering with Panda to bypass
sanctions and export controls to conduct business in Iran. These
violations serve as further evidence of China's willingness to disregard
international norms and conventions when it is convenient or expedient.

[[China's **failure**]{.mark} to enforce treaties]{.underline} and
sanctions [[and lack of]{.mark} corporate
**[accountability]{.mark}**]{.underline} should [serve as a **warning**
for]{.underline} the [international community]{.underline} when it comes
to Chinese participation in international agreements and instruments. Of
recent interest is their 2018 signature of the Agreement to Prevent
Unregulated High Seas Fisheries [[in the]{.underline}]{.mark} Central
[**[Arctic]{.mark}** Ocean]{.underline}. The signatory parties committed
to curbing high seas commercial fishing in the Arctic until the
ecosystem is better understood, no sooner than 2034. Beijing's
participation in the negotiations, and signing of the fisheries
moratorium, helps bolster its long-term narrative of [China's identity
as a]{.underline} "[**near-Arctic** state]{.underline}"
[with]{.underline} a [legitimate right]{.underline} to
[[involve]{.underline}]{.mark} itself in [[decisions about the
**future**]{.mark} of the region]{.underline}.

However, based on past actions, there is [**no reason** to
believe]{.underline} the [**[Chinese gov]{.mark}**ernment will enforce
this **agreement**]{.underline}. When it is convenient, and when there
are economic incentives to cheat, [China [has a history of turning a
**blind eye** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**illegal**
activity]{.underline}]{.mark} of its industries, or tacitly supporting
them. Given the scale and reach of the Chinese off-shore fishing fleet,
and its ever-increasing demand for sea-based protein sources, it would
be short-sighted to expect the government of China to enforce the
fishing ban, especially in light of its record. The [agreement also
gives **China**]{.underline} a plausible [justification to deploy
**C**hina **C**oast **G**uard]{.underline} (CCG) vessels into the Arctic
under the banner of "enforcement" of the fishing ban. Once there, they
could be a powerful and permanent presence that would undermine the
security and sovereignty of actual Arctic nations.

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** already [ha**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}
demonstrated a [[**dismal** record when]{.underline}]{.mark} it comes to
[[enforcing **reg**]{.mark}ulation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} on their
fishing fleet. A report published in February 2019 cites China as
world's worst country (by far) [[in]{.mark} terms of
**[I]{.mark}**llegal]{.underline},
[**[u]{.mark}**nreported]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[**[u]{.mark}**nderreported]{.underline} (IUU) [fishing]{.underline},
and notes specific deficiencies in terms of flag-state and port-state
controls over fishing vessels. [The **U**nited **S**tates should not
expect better **controls**]{.underline} or compliance [when]{.underline}
these vessels begin to [[test the **unfished** waters of the
**Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Militarily, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** also has a record of
[[employing]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[**fishing fleet** as]{.mark} a
[maritime **militia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, surging the
[**[vessels]{.mark}** into the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea and
leveraging their presence]{.underline} as a means of asserting
sovereignty in the disputed region. The [fishing vessels [have been
**active aggressors**]{.mark}]{.underline}, harassing and firing water
cannons at fishing vessels from Vietnam and the Philippines. The 2018
Department of Defense report to Congress regarding China's military
power notes the recent construction of a fleet of 84 state-owned "large
militia fishing vessels with reinforced hulls and ammunition storage" as
part of the People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM). The report
notes "the **[PAFMM]{.underline}** [is the only government-sanctioned
**maritime militia** in the worl]{.underline}d," and that the
[**vessel** [crews are]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[paid]{.underline}]{.mark}** salaries independent of any clear
commercial fishing responsibilities, and recruited from recently
separated veterans." [These vessels are [a **multilevel**
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}: [mobilized [as covert **force
projection**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but also]{.mark} as a plausible
**[justification]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} overt
[**[P]{.mark}**eople's **[L]{.mark}**iberation **[A]{.mark}**rmy
**[N]{.mark}**avy]{.underline} (PLAN) and CCG [surface
**[presence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in any region where they are
operating.

It is only a matter of time before these vessels begin operating in the
Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, perhaps under the guise of scientific
research or future legal fishing. Much like in the South China Sea,
these vessels represent the far-left end of a continuum of force that
escalates into white-hulled CCG vessels and, eventually, gray-hulled
PLAN warships. China's intentions in this regard seem transparent. The
question remains whether the U.S. or the other Arctic nations are
willing or able to counter this threat.

Last year, the [U.S. **Coast Guard** published an Arctic **Strategic
Outlook** that prioritized strengthening the **rules-based order** in
the Arctic]{.underline}. [[By taking]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}** role in the Arctic, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [can hold cheaters
**accountable**]{.mark}]{.underline} and remind those who would ignore
such rules that these commitments and agreements aren't just for show,
or applicable only when convenient. The Arctic Council and Arctic Coast
Guard Forum are excellent venues for Arctic nations to align global
interests, and employ consensus to achieve mutually beneficial ends.
However, for the U.S. Coast Guard and the other Arctic coast guards to
counter threats, enforce the fishing moratorium, and protect Arctic
resources, they need the right tools: ice-capable vessels, advanced data
acquisition and sharing capabilities, and more personnel to keep watch
over the world's smallest and most vulnerable ocean.

#### [Extinction]{.underline}\-\--ozone [depletion]{.underline}. 

**Terrapass '22** \[Terrapass; December 14; Social enterprise that

[**[C]{.mark}**hloro**[f]{.mark}**luoro**[c]{.mark}**arbon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(CFCs) [[are the **biggest** threat to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[ozone]{.underline}]{.mark}** layer today. Years ago, CFCs were found
in aerosol sprays and refrigerator coolants. These CFCs themselves
weren't destroying the ozone layer. Instead, it was the chemicals they
[[**broke down** into]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[the sun's **UV
rays**]{.mark} contacted]{.underline} them, such as chlorine.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which
were once found in refrigerants, insulating foam, solvents, and more,
are also ozone-depleting substances (ODS) because they release chlorine
atoms in the stratosphere too, which destroys the Earth's ozone layer.
Fortunately, the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the
Ozone Layer, which led to the phase-out of all CFCs and other
ozone-depleting chemicals, was ratified by all 197 United Nations (UN)
members. A 2016 amendment helped also phase out HCFCs. This phase-out
led to the slowing of ozone loss from the Earth's atmosphere and the
eventual evidence of ozone recovery starting in 2000 and continuing
today. Some other threats to the atmospheric ozone layer include
chemicals like methyl bromide, halons, and methyl chloroform. These
chemicals are used in various pesticides, fire extinguishers, and
solvents, respectively. New threats have since emerged in the depletion
of the ozone layer, and a major one is dichloromethane emission. This is
a naturally occurring chemical, but it can also be emitted from
industrial production. In fact, from 2011 through 2019, China's
dichloromethane emissions nearly tripled. However, if dichloromethane
emissions are held to current levels, it would only delay the ozone
repair by about five years. Is the Ozone Layer Still a Concern? Yes,
though the Antarctic ozone hole is showing signs of repair and is on
pace to fully repair itself around 2050, it remains a serious concern.
First, all the nations that ratified the Montreal Protocol must continue
abiding by it. If not, this can bring ozone depletion back. However,
there are other ozone concerns too. A major issue was the 2018 discovery
that though the upper stratosphere ozone concentration was increasing,
the lower stratosphere levels were still declining. This could be a
direct result of short-lived chlorinated chemicals, such as
dichloromethane, reaching these lower levels before being eliminated by
the sun's UV rays. Can We Live Without the Ozone Layer?

\<\<\<Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>\>

No. [[All life on **Earth**]{.underline}]{.mark} as we know it [[would

[[The **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, long considered an untouched
frontier, [[is becoming a **flashpoint** for geopolitical
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}, [with **fishing rights** emerging as a
**critical** area]{.underline} of contention. As [receding ice opens new
waters]{.underline} for commercial activity, the [issue of
**overfishing**]{.underline}, particularly [by **Chinese
fleets**]{.underline}, poses significant ecological, economic, and
security threats. The [[rapid **expansion** of China's]{.mark}
distant-water [**fishing** industry in **Arctic-adjacent**
regions]{.mark} has [amplified concerns]{.mark} over **resource
depletion**]{.underline}, [**environment**al damage]{.underline}, [and
the **erosion** of sovereignty]{.underline} among Arctic nations.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

China's Arctic Ambitions As published in the 2018 white paper China's
Arctic Policy, China has self-declared its status as a "near-Arctic
state" with ambitions to play a significant role in the region's future.
China has articulated its advocacy for conservation, rational use, and
adherence to international agreements like UNCLOS. The Policy states
their support in creating an Arctic fisheries management organization,
conducting research and exploratory fishing, and fostering cooperation
with Arctic coastal states to balance resource use and ecosystem
protection. However, the actions of China's distant-water fishing (DWF)
fleet suggest a more expansionist approach that contradicts these stated
policies. China's DWF fleet, the largest in the world, comprises over
3,000 vessels and is a state-supported network that operates far beyond
China's coastal waters. Although many of the vessels are privately
owned, they are coordinated by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Affairs and receive substantial government subsidies, which
enables broad geographic reach and sustained operations across distant
oceans, including the Arctic. China's DWF fleet's history of operating
in foreign exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and international waters
raises concerns about its potential future operations in Arctic waters.
While China currently lacks a direct fishing presence in the Arctic,
expanding its fleet into adjacent areas could be a precursor to more
active involvement. The Arctic's rich marine biodiversity and economic
potential make it a likely target for Chinese fishing interests in the
near future. China's Involvement China is a signatory to the Central
Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement (CAOFA), which prohibits any country
from fishing in the high seas portion of the central Arctic Ocean until
a joint scientific program can ensure the sustainability of the
potential fisheries. Currently, there are no Chinese fishing vessels in
the Arctic; however, China continues to play a role in processing
Alaskan seafood and employing workers in Greenland. While the stated
policy is framed as cooperative, its aggressive fishing practices tell a
different story. Its track record in other regions suggests a
willingness to disregard international agreements when it serves their
interests. China's involvement in Arctic-adjacent fisheries has already
led to concerns over stock depletion and illegal fishing activities.
Chinese DWF vessels have been linked to overfishing in the North Pacific
and Antarctic waters. Similar behavior in Arctic waters could
destabilize local ecosystems and undermine existing regulatory
frameworks. China's DWF has expanded its reach into Arctic and
sub-Arctic waters, targeting fish stocks that are crucial to the
ecosystems and economies of Arctic nations. China's fishing practices in
international waters adjacent to the Arctic, including illegal,
unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, have led to significant stock
depletion in other regions and could pose a threat to Arctic marine
biodiversity. The growing presence of Chinese vessels also raises
concerns about enforcement, as monitoring vast and remote Arctic waters
challenges the capacity of coastal states. The Ecological Impact of
Overfishing

\<\<\<Paragraph Integrity Resumes\>\>\>

The [**[Arctic]{.mark}** Ocean is [experiencing]{.mark} significant
**[ecological shifts]{.mark}** due to climate change]{.underline}.
[Increasing]{.underline} sea surface [temperatures]{.underline}, changes
in regional oceanography, and the [[decline of permanent **sea
ice**]{.underline}]{.mark} are altering the composition of marine
ecosystems. **[[Ocean acidification]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[driven by
rising]{.mark} atmospheric **[carbon]{.mark} dioxide**
[levels]{.mark}]{.underline}, is another pressing issue. The Arctic
Ocean is warming and acidifying faster than most other regions,
affecting the distributions and productivity of key species such as
Arctic cod, red king crab, and tanner crab. These species play vital
roles in the ecosystem, supporting predators like seals, seabirds, and
polar bears.

As a greater portion of the central Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free for
longer periods, commercial fishing opportunities are likely to increase.
Approximately 15% of the world's marine fisheries are caught in the
Subarctic and Arctic, primarily from large commercial fisheries in
regions such as the Barents Sea, the Central North Atlantic, and the
Bering Sea. In contrast, the interior Arctic shelves have supported
smaller subsistence fisheries. However, the [**warming** waters are
causing species to shift northward]{.underline}, [[increasing]{.mark}
the [likelihood of **commercial expansion**]{.mark} into previously
untouched areas]{.underline}.

Economic and Sovereignty Concerns

[Sustainable **fishing** is an economic lifeline]{.underline} and a
cultural cornerstone [for **Arctic** nations]{.underline} like Norway,
Iceland, and Canada. China's incursion into Arctic fisheries undermines
local industries and threatens long-term financial stability. [**[IUU
fishing]{.mark}** also [creates **economic
disparity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [[Chinese **vessels** exploit
resources]{.mark} without adhering to international agreements or
**local reg**ulation**s**]{.underline}. IUU fishing undermines local
economies and erodes sovereignty. Chinese vessels in Arctic waters could
[create flashpoints **over fishing** rights]{.underline}, particularly
in contested areas.

The [**Arctic's ecosystems** are not only crucial for
**[biodiversity]{.mark}** but also]{.underline} for the subsistence
lifestyles of [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. Indigenous communities
rely on these ecosystems for traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering
practices, which are deeply intertwined with their cultural heritage and
livelihoods. [Their **subsistence**]{.underline} activities [are
directly [threatened]{.mark} by **overfishing**]{.underline} and
environmental degradation, particularly from external actors like China.

Indigenous peoples hold significant influence in Arctic governance
through their permanent participant seats on the Arctic Council. These
seats, held by organizations such as the Inuit Circumpolar Council and
the Saami Council, allow Indigenous voices to shape discussions on
sustainable development, resource management, and environmental
protection. This influence is a critical counterbalance to external
pressures, such as Chinese fishing activities. Indigenous
representatives have consistently emphasized the importance of
preserving the Arctic's ecosystems, advocating for stringent regulations
to protect their way of life and asserting their rights in the face of
foreign encroachment.

The Arctic Council's recognition of Indigenous groups showcases their
pivotal role in shaping policies that prioritize sustainability and
sovereignty. This dynamic adds weight to the resistance against China's
potential expansion into Arctic fisheries, highlighting the integral
role of Indigenous communities in safeguarding the region's ecological
and economic stability.

Geopolitical Implications

[[**China's** fishing]{.mark} practices must be viewed
within]{.underline} the broader context of its [**geopolitical**
strategy]{.underline}. By expanding its [presence in **Arctic
fisheries**]{.underline}, China not only [[secures access to
**valuable** resources]{.mark} but also increases its leverage in
**regional gov**ernance]{.underline}. This strategy aligns with China's
broader approach to maritime power projection.

Russia, the largest Arctic territory, has cooperated with China on
Arctic energy and trade projects, providing Beijing access to critical
Arctic routes. While Russia's fishing interests align with Arctic
nations, its partnership with China creates a complex dynamic in which
Chinese overfishing could [[indirectly benefit Russian]{.mark}
**strategic [goals]{.mark}** [by destabilizing]{.mark} Western
**[Arctic]{.mark}** nations]{.underline}.

International Response

Addressing the issue of overfishing in the Arctic requires coordinated
international action. Existing frameworks, such as the Arctic Council
and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement, provide mechanisms for
dialogue and regulation; however, enforcement remains a significant
challenge. Arctic nations must strengthen surveillance, enhance
cooperation on IUU fishing, and pressure China to adhere to sustainable
practices.

National governments have also taken proactive measures to protect
Arctic ecosystems. For instance, the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council (NPFMC) implemented the Arctic Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in
2009 to address concerns over unregulated commercial fishing in U.S.
waters off Alaska. The Arctic FMP prohibits commercial fishing in the
Arctic Management Area and requires scientific research to ensure
sustainable fishery practices.

Additionally, technological innovations, such as satellite monitoring
and autonomous marine surveillance systems, can improve the detection of
illegal fishing activities. The investment of Arctic nations and their
allies in these capabilities will be crucial in countering overfishing
and protecting marine biodiversity.

Conclusion

China's growing influence and unsustainable fishing practices threaten
the delicate balance of Arctic ecosystems, undermining regional
economies and raising sovereignty concerns. As **[Arctic
nations]{.underline}** confront this challenge, they [must strike a
**balance** between **ecological preservation** and **geopolitical**
strategy]{.underline}, [ensuring]{.underline} the region's [resources
are protected for **future gen**eration**s**]{.underline}. The fight for
[[Arctic fish is about]{.mark} more than **seafood**]{.underline}; [it
is a battle for environmental **[sustainability]{.mark}**]{.underline},
economic security, [[and **geopolitical stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}
in one of the world's most critical frontiers.

Russia's military posture in the Pacific Arctic

The [**Kremlin** has two main priorities in ensuring
**sovereignty**]{.underline} and protecting its national interests [[in
the Pacific **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}: 1) [protecting the
**NSR**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} 2) [extending Russia's
**military capabilities**]{.underline} [beyond]{.underline} the
**[AZRF]{.underline}**.

Protecting NSR approaches

In the Pacific Arctic, a two-part logic applies, similar to that on the
Kola peninsula. [[**Russia** seeks]{.mark} comprehensive [**control**
over access]{.mark}]{.underline} for foreign military assets around its
perimeter, while in the far-sea zone it is [extending its capabilities
[to **disrupt** foreign military activity]{.mark}]{.underline} at longer
ranges both at sea and in the air.

The Pacific Fleet is the mainstay of Russia's force in the Pacific
Arctic region and along the Far Eastern seaboard down to the Kamchatka
peninsula and the Sea of Okhotsk. Headquartered in Vladivostok, the
Pacific Fleet has an area of responsibility that stretches from the Far
Eastern seaboard to the Bering Sea and the Bering Strait, and protects
access to the Chukchi Sea along the AZRF and the NSR. The Pacific Fleet
is responsible for around one-third of Russia's second-strike, sea-based
nuclear deterrent.

In the Kremlin's narrative, [recent **American actions**]{.underline} in
the region are [validating Moscow's **threat perception** and
vindicating Russian **force posture**]{.underline}. In June 2020, Russia
dispatched an air-wing to 'escort' US B-52H bombers flying in airspace
close to the Sea of Okhotsk.78 Also, in October 2020, Russia announced
it had picked up the signal of two US B-1B strategic bombers over the
Bering Sea.79 More recently, in October 2021, Russia said it prevented a
US Navy destroyer from entering Russian waters in the Sea of Japan.80

[[**Moscow** believes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [such activity [must be
met with a **strong response**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which
increases]{.mark} the [risk of **escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the North Pacific. [The situation is **compounded** by]{.underline} the
fact that [Russia seeks to **undermine** US strategic
**dominance**]{.underline} in northeast Asia, and, more specifically,
the deployment of theatre missile defence in Japan and South Korea.81
Such deployments arguably prevent the Kremlin from increasing its
defence in depth further south and around the Sea of Okhotsk.

Extending interdiction capabilities

As with the Kola Bastion, Russia seeks to extend its interdiction
ambitions beyond the AZRF in the North Pacific. This is particularly
visible further south in the Sea of Okhotsk. In 2014, the United Nations
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UNCLCS) confirmed a
Russian claim allowing it to extend its continental shelf under the
seabed in the Sea of Okhotsk, giving Russia access to the subsea and sea
floor some 200 nautical miles from its coastline.82

Yet, the [**UNCLCS** findings were]{.underline} deliberately
[interpreted]{.underline} by Moscow as a way [to **exert**]{.underline}
the same **[control]{.underline}** over surface waters as it would have
over internal waters, in order to close off the surface of the entire
open sea to [foreign **[vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, civilian and
military alike. In other words, the Sea of Okhotsk was turned into an
'internal Russian sea'.83 Since then, Russia has been
[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} its military presence through the
deployment of [[sea- and air-**denial
capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} on the ground, on the Kamchatka
peninsula and on the disputed Kuril Islands/Northern Territories, as
well as at sea.

However, Russia has no ambitions -- nor does it have the military
capabilities -- to replicate the multi-layered protective dome deployed
on the Kola peninsula and to create an 'Okhotsk Bastion'. Indeed,
Russia's strategic posture is much weaker in the North Pacific than in
the North Atlantic: neither Pacific Fleet assets nor the Kamchatka
installations are in particularly good condition, while climate change
is impacting infrastructure.84

The idea of sustaining, let alone projecting, a Bastion protective dome
covering sea approaches to the North Pacific seems a distant prospect.
This does not mean, however, that Russia is unable to contest and
disrupt the presence of US forces and its regional allies.

Chokepoints and flashpoints in the Pacific Arctic

Beyond the AZRF, the deployment of a coastal and near-sea defensive line
from the Kuril Islands/Northern Territories and the Sea of Okhotsk up to
the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea speaks of
**[[real]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- but limited -- [[ambitions regarding
**control**]{.mark} and denial]{.underline} in the North Pacific. This
[[has]{.mark} direct security **[consequences]{.mark}** for the US and
its regional allies [in]{.mark} two **[key]{.mark}**]{.underline}
navigational **[[chokepoints]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Bering Strait chokepoint

Like the GIUK and GIN gaps in the European Arctic, the [**Bering**
Strait could be threatened by Russian **deployments**]{.underline}. It
may become -- although to a lesser extent than in the European Arctic --
another point of contention between Russia and the US over both freedom
of navigation/innocent passage and access to and from the Pacific
Arctic.85

There are ongoing discussions in Russia regarding the management of the
Bering Strait. The 1990 USSR--US Maritime Boundary Agreement created the
'Baker--Shevardnadze line' across the Bering Strait, effectively marking
the border between Russia and the US in the Chukchi and Bering Seas.86
However, following the collapse of the USSR, Russia did not ratify the
agreement and only agreed to observe it temporarily.

There are [[now]{.mark} **worrying** signs that the Kremlin may [seek to
**contest**]{.mark}]{.underline} both the line itself and future rights
to [[passage through the **Bering Strait**]{.underline}]{.mark}.87
Nevertheless, the latter remains an unrealistic prospect, as Russia has
no capacity to conduct SLOC interdiction operations in the Bering Sea.

However, the Kuril--Chukchi defensive line could become a significant
issue for US assets in terms of uncontested access to the North Pacific
SLOC and to the coast off Alaska. This is compounded by the fact that
Russia intends to expand its fishing industry in the Chukchi Sea, with
an increase in the number of civilian and coastguard surface vessels
close to the Bering Strait and to US territorial waters possible.88

Tension over the Kuril Islands/Northern Territories and the Sea of
Okhotsk

Increased military activity on and around the Kuril Islands/Northern
Territories puts more pressure on Japanese national security and greatly
reduces the prospect of any form of bilateral settlement between Japan
and Russia.89 Air defence identification zone (ADIZ) violations and
airspace incursions, especially over Japan, are now commonplace.90

The presence of Russian out-of-area assets in the North Pacific is
compounded by the deepening of military and defence cooperation between
Russia and China in recent years. The two countries now regularly
conduct joint aviation and bomber patrols over the Sea of Japan and the
East China Sea, close to the Japanese ADIZ.91

These activities are not benign and increasingly show signs of
contestation in the form both of planned violations of the regional
airspace over the Sea of Japan and of incursions into the airspace of
Japan and South Korea. For example, in July 2019, Russia and China
conducted their first joint long-range military aviation patrol.

The exercise escalated into a reconnaissance-in-force operation92 when
they overtly violated both the Japanese and South Korean ADIZs.93
Provocatively, Russian and Chinese assets flew over the disputed
Dokdo/Takeshima islands.

In October 2021, the [**[Maritime]{.mark}** Interaction **[bilateral
drills]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Sea of Japan [[showcased]{.mark}
deeper **military [coop]{.mark}**eration [between]{.mark} Russia and
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}, notably in terms of joint air defence and
ASW. More significantly, their respective [naval forces
[conducted]{.mark} their first **[joint patrol]{.mark}**]{.underline}
through the Tsugaru Strait.94

[Such [**military** activities]{.mark} with China have clear advantages
for Russia]{.underline} as it [seeks to [increase its
**defence**]{.mark}]{.underline} in depth in the North Pacific,95 not
least as a sign of contestation against any US theatre missile defence
presence.

05 Antarctica, the Southern Ocean and the South Pole Moscow has an
increasingly securitized understanding of the future of Antarctica and
the Southern Ocean. This is reflected in policies aimed at safeguarding
Russian interests within the ATS, as well as policies allowing Russia to
contest the maritime and naval activities of other states in the
Southern Ocean. As Russia strengthens its presence in the Southern
Ocean, the Kremlin has developed increasingly securitized views of the
region's future and of the ATS. Despite the absence of a genuine polar
strategy, Russia understands the Antarctic as a space for geopolitical,
geo-economic and geo-scientific competition in which its interests need
to be safeguarded and protected -- just as in the Arctic -- including
via military means. Russia's approach to Antarctica and the Southern
Ocean Russia views the South Pole in geopolitical terms due to the
increased number of actors present in Antarctic affairs -- notably
including China -- and overlapping interests between claimant and
non-claimant states like Russia. The Kremlin is seeking to ensure
Russia's future place within the ATS: approved in June 2021, Russia's
new Antarctic action plan for 203096 continues to reflect such
ambitions. Moscow is preparing for the future and its actions equate to
contingency planning. In security terms, this translates into the
strengthening of Russia's maritime presence and activities on the
Antarctic continent, often with suspected military and intelligence
purposes. Beyond the future of the ATS, two main issues stand out.
First, there are Russia's efforts to obtain stronger regulations for
marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean under the Convention
on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR
Convention). The Kremlin does not oppose the creation of MPAs,97 but
wants to ensure that activities within them are strictly monitored and
are consistent with UNCLOS and International Maritime Organization
regulations. 98 Russia portrays itself as a guardian of MPA regulations
seeking to prevent a 'free for all' approach from claimant and
non-claimant states that would undermine official conservation goals. In
reality, this demonstrates its fear of missing out if other states
increase their footprint in the Southern Ocean. Moscow wants to ensure
MPAs cannot be used by claimant states as a springboard for extended
territorial claims and increased control over the continent. Second,
Russia has been using fishing activities as an excuse to regulate the
presence of foreign actors in the Southern Ocean. As it does on MPA
regulations, Moscow regularly denounces what it alleges are instances of
discrimination over Russia's restricted access to regional bioresources,
mostly for the purposes of krill and toothfish fishing.99 Russia has a
self-serving, 'all or nothing'100 approach to fishing rights: if Moscow
cannot have unrestricted access to fishing grounds, nobody else should
either. Blocking future developments in Antarctic fishing allows Russia
to alleviate its concerns over territorial claims. However, Russia still
suffers major limitations in distant-water fishing: its current fleet is
a shadow of that during the Soviet era, and annual fishing volumes have
dropped since then. Recent plans to increase national production of
seafood101 (and of krill in particular) are unlikely to change the
situation dramatically. Russian capabilities and infrastructure in
Antarctica Under the ATS, Antarctica is officially a demilitarized and
nuclear-free continent, where military activity is strictly regulated
and limited to 'peaceful purposes'.102 This, of course, leaves room for
interpretation. With regard to Russia, the main concerns over its
potential military activity relate to two key areas: ground-based space
research and Antarctic stations; and expeditions that can have military
and intelligence purposes. Space research and the placement of satellite
technology assets on the continent are often considered a form of
military activity in disguise, notably for ISR purposes and
communications. Through the state corporation Roscosmos, Russia has been
increasing the deployment of remote-sensing capabilities, satellite
relays103 and ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS)
installations in Antarctica.104 As GLONASS is a dual-use system, there
are suspicions that Russia is using it for military and intelligence
purposes -- mostly to track missiles and to increase command and control
(C2) capabilities. In the context of the 2021 Antarctic action plan, the
reopened Russkaya station is set to host GLONASS installations in the
coming years. A worrying sign would be the covert deployment of
electronic warfare or anti-satellite capabilities on the continent,105
both of which would be clear violations of the ATS. Russia's network of
stations in Antarctica -- inherited from Soviet times -- is in
relatively bad condition and suffers from crippling infrastructure
problems.106 Of the 10 Russian research stations on the continent, only
five are reported to be working year-round.107 The modernization and
refurbishment of these stations is integral to the 2021 national action
plan. Wintering complexes planned at the Mirny and Vostok stations to
accommodate future expeditions could also be used for military purposes
and for military training for operating in extreme weather conditions.
Navy-led oceanographic research trips, such as the 2016 Admiral
Vladimirsky expedition,108 are another cause for concern. Indeed,
hydrographic surveys conducted in the Southern Ocean could be equally
used for naval intelligence and surveillance purposes, notably to track
submarine activities outside the perimeter covered by the ATS. Russia is
also investing in technologies hardened to extreme weather conditions
that could be employed by the armed forces, while defence industry
companies have been conducting growing numbers of aerial drone tests on
the continent.109 Antarctic flashpoints Russia's current posture and the
growth in dual-purpose activities are both considered fundamental to
safeguard the country's interests within the ATS, as well as allowing it
to contest the maritime and naval activities of other states in the
Southern Ocean. However, such Russian activities increase the risk of
miscalculation and confrontation. Antarctic governance and the future of
the ATS The question remains whether Russia would become a revisionist
party to the ATS if it did not consider its national interests to be
protected. This represents a potential flashpoint within the legal
architecture of the Antarctic region. As elsewhere in the world, Moscow
holds misconceived grievances regarding its role and place in Antarctic
affairs. The Russian leadership thinks the country has been marginalized
and that the ATS is 'unfair' to Russia.110 Russian policymakers often
denounce the 'geopoliticization' of the ATS and the possibility for
claimant states to make pre-emptive extended claims over Antarctica.111
These grievances are further reflected in media propaganda, which claims
the West intends to 'capture' the continent from Russia.112 This
narrative means that Russia will oppose any attempts by claimant and
non-claimant states to modify the ATS. Russia is not a revisionist party
in Antarctica but would not exclude the possibility of acting first
should the ATS show signs of disunity or collapse.113 Such contingency
planning is best exemplified by the growing number of geological and
seismological surveys114 carried out by the state holding company
Rosgeologia in the Weddell Sea, the Riiser-Larsen Sea and off Queen Maud
Land. These expeditions are designed to give Russia a better
understanding of the offshore hydrocarbon potential of those areas and
possibility of future extraction. Other expeditions are conducting
hydrographic surveys of mineral potential, notably for rare earth metals
and uranium. This issue has also been crystallizing around fears that
the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection (also known as the Madrid
Protocol)115 could collapse. In 2048, the ban on mineral extraction in
Antarctica will potentially be open for review. There is little chance,
however, that Russia would seek a renegotiation of the Madrid Protocol,
and it certainly would not initiate such a review alone. Nevertheless,
Russia is ensuring that if such a situation arises, it will have
positioned itself to benefit from the extraction of Antarctic natural
resources.116 Legally speaking, such activities fall into the doctrine
of uti possidetis, which means that Russia is intending 'conquest and
subjugation'117 against claimant states or should the Madrid Protocol be
contested. Russia is unlikely to abandon the ATS. Moscow, however,
reserves the right to do so if it perceives a need to fight for Russian
interests in Antarctica. Managing incidents at the South Pole As Russia
becomes more assertive in its Antarctic posture and increases its
presence there through expeditions, bases and suspected dual-purpose
activities, the potential for accidents that could lead to
miscalculation and escalation grows. The 'Novo incident' in 2018 is an
example of this. Under ATS provisions, Norway conducted an official
inspection of the Novo and Perseus runways at the Novolazarevskaya air
base. During this inspection, however, Russia deliberately blocked
access to the Perseus runway, raising concerns over the nature of
Russian activities at the base. The Norwegian report noted the 'level of
activity at the air base', citing a 'potential tendency toward a larger
number of aircraft'.118 This not only increases the risk of aerial
incidents in the region, but also raises questions regarding military
and intelligence activities. A more recent example is the case of the
Russian fishing vessel Palmer. In January 2020, a New Zealand patrol
aircraft spotted the Palmer fishing illegally in protected waters in the
Ross Sea. New Zealand accused the crew of falsifying its vessel
monitoring system and required that the Palmer be added to the list of
illegal, unregulated and unreported vessels.119 However, Russia
threatened to use its veto power at the Commission for the Conservation
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) as leverage, and the
Palmer retained its fishing licence. Although they do not yet form a
systematic pattern, these examples show that Russia is contesting what
it considers efforts by claimant states to delegitimize Russian
interests and activities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Such
incidents are likely to increase in number and magnitude in the coming
years, which would give Moscow an excuse to strengthen its regional
presence and posture -- or even to become an active 'spoiler' within the
ATS. 06 Policy impact and consequences

\<\<\<Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>\>

[Russia's increasingly **militarized** posture]{.underline} in polar
affairs has two main consequences for Arctic coastal states and for the
future of the ATS: it [creates the potential for **accidents** and
**miscalc**ulations]{.underline}, and will require policies to deal with
Russia--China interaction at both poles.

Miscalculation, accidents and tactical errors

Russian stakeholders remain convinced that NATO is deliberately moving
closer to Russia's Arctic and that ATS claimant states are not
respecting Moscow's interests in the Antarctic region. This situation
increases the risk of miscalculation and tactical errors, which could
lead to unwanted escalation.

Polar miscalculations

At the South Pole, risks of miscalculation are linked to Russia's
increased presence and assertive posture regarding other parties to the
ATS (see Chapter 5). These are longer-term prospects but could force the
Kremlin to adopt a comprehensive and combined approach to both poles.
Indeed, a similar pattern is slowly emerging between security issues in
the Arctic and Antarctic regions -- largely as a result of increased
human activity.

In the Arctic, the equation is simple: under the impact of climate
change, greater human access to, and presence in, Arctic waters (whether
for commercial, civilian or military purposes) will increase the number
and frequency of accidents and incidents both at sea and in the air.
This will, in turn, raise the risk of miscalculation.

A greater number of surface vessels, underwater systems and aerial
platforms in the European Arctic and Pacific Arctic -- coupled with
[**extreme weather** events]{.underline} and the non-linear nature of
[**climate** change]{.underline} -- [[will make **day-to-day**]{.mark}
activities]{.underline} such as patrols and [[**constabulary** missions
harder to **manage**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Arctic is also not immune
to [[**environmental** and **safety** risks]{.underline}]{.mark},
notably [[from **nuclear**-powered **vessels** and those carrying
nuclear **missiles**]{.underline}]{.mark}.120 This is equally true for
the Southern Ocean.

The situation is [[made worse by]{.mark} the [**reduction** in]{.mark}
official channels of **[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline} with Russia
since 2014 and further deterioration [since]{.underline} early
**[2022]{.underline}**. [[Russia's behaviour and lack of
**restraint**]{.underline}]{.mark} generally are also [[cause]{.mark}s
for **[concern]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [from its lack of
**transparency** [in dealing with serious **environmental
events**]{.mark}]{.underline}121 to its military activities in
peacetime. The latter include dangerous manoeuvres against Norwegian
assets;122 ADIZ violations against Japan and South Korea; GPS-jamming in
northern Finland and Norway during the NATO 'Trident Juncture' exercise
in 2018;123 snap missile drills;124 and other military activity taking
place beyond the AZRF.125 These activities particularly impact the
overall security of the Barents, Norwegian and Bering Seas (see Chapters
2--4 for discussion of existing chokepoints).

The risk of miscalculation is compounded by Russia's need to 'respond'
to the expansion of NATO in the European Arctic (Finland and Sweden
potentially joining the alliance being a case in point)126 and NATO's
supposed activities directed against the AZRF, as well as the increased
US presence in the Pacific theatre.127 For the US, NATO and their
allies, an additional risk is that their regional military assets could
be threatened by Russian systems, and particularly by naval aviation
groups and air-superiority assets, long-range missile systems and
strategic bomber overflights.

Managing escalation

Military tension in the Arctic is slowly building around demonstrations
of access and presence through naval and aerial missions. For example,
in May 2020, the US and the UK conducted a maritime security operation
in the Barents Sea.128 Russia denounced this operation as provocative
and responded by deploying Northern Fleet surface vessels.129 At the
same time, recent Russian violations of the Japanese and South Korean
ADIZs indicate a similar intent to demonstrate uncontested access for
Russia (see Chapter 4).

Such activities are likely to multiply in the short term, potentially
leading to an escalatory dynamic between Russia and NATO partners and
allies. From Russia's point of view, Western-led operations in the
Arctic and Antarctica encourage the Kremlin's self-constructed
perception of encirclement by NATO and US forces and consequent
**[[remilitarization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of both regions.

In turn, the situation [[forces other]{.mark} coastal [states to act to
**counter**]{.mark} the Russian [threat]{.mark}]{.underline} --
especially in the context of the Russia--Ukraine conflict. Indeed, [[an
**important** risk factor is]{.mark} linked to potential [horizontal
**escalation**]{.mark}**130**]{.underline} [[into and out of]{.mark} the
region]{.underline}, [notably from]{.underline} the European Arctic to
the Baltic Sea and to the North Atlantic, as well as to northeast Asia
and [[the **Sea of Japan**]{.mark} in the Pacific theatre]{.underline}.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

There are further Russian insecurities around the status of the NSR and
the perception in Moscow that Russia's interpretation of the 'Ice
clause' (see Chapter 3) will soon be contested by US-led FONOPs using
surface assets or submarines.131 The reality, however, is quite
different, and US-led naval FONOPs through the NSR are unlikely in the
short to medium term. The US Navy has acknowledged the cost and risks
linked to such operations, and the expert community is advising caution
and restraint.132 The situation in the Antarctic region is different but
equally serious. An increased number of claimant and non-claimant states
developing their presence in the Southern Ocean -- not least for
commercial and resource-prospecting purposes -- will undoubtedly bring
policing and/or military escorts to protect vessels and other assets.
The gradual destruction of the ATS provisions that enshrine the
demilitarization of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean could then follow.
Such a situation would have dire consequences for the wider security of
the continent and the Southern Ocean, with the risk of creating a 'free
for all' among claimant states. Russia--China polar relations China's
policy towards the Arctic and Antarctica is well covered by the expert
community.133 It is, however, paramount to look at the relationship
between Russia and China at both the North and South Poles and to assess
its impact for the security of regional stakeholders. Russia's approach
to China at both poles is pragmatic and compartmentalized. While for now
it is developing cooperation within the ATS, Russia is much more
cautious when it comes to the Arctic, where the Chinese presence is
merely tolerated. At both poles, Russia needs to manage China's attempts
to shape the future of polar governance, and take steps to ensure that
Russian interests are respected. Bilateral relations in the Arctic China
has been an observer at the Arctic Council since 2013 and published its
first Arctic white paper in January 2018.134 The document caused much
consternation internationally, as it defined China as a 'near Arctic
state' and presented the idea of a 'Polar Silk Road' linked to the Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI).135 Since then, Beijing has been increasing
its presence across the region.136 This leaves Russia in a difficult
position. The Kremlin needs China as a user of the NSR for liquefied
natural gas (LNG) and energy exports. China has been operating in the
NSR since 2015,137 and LNG cargoes to China represent roughly 20 per
cent of transits each year. Beijing is also a key partner in both
regional LNG projects138 and the Power of Siberia gas pipeline.139
However, Russia remains mistrustful of China's intentions in the Arctic.
So far, China has been using the NSR but has not provided infrastructure
investments to help Russia develop it. Moscow is suspicious over China's
willingness to change norms and regulations in Arctic affairs. Beijing
is interested in creating a China-friendly normative environment in the
Arctic and turning the region into a part of the 'global commons'.140
These diverging positions directly clash with Russia's view regarding
national interests (a view shared by Canada and Norway to a large
extent). Privately,141 the Russian leadership is critical of China's
self-proclaimed 'near Arctic' status for fear of the precedent that
might create, while also working to prevent the Polar Silk Road from
overlapping with the NSR or even from 'absorbing' it in the future. The
situation is exacerbated by Russian negative perceptions of Chinese
military interests in the Arctic, including the fact that a new fleet of
Chinese nuclear-powered icebreakers is currently being built to People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) specifications.142 Icebreakers could be used
as escorts for Chinese ships transiting through the Arctic, as well as
to support Chinese submarines conducting nuclear-deterrence operations
against the presence of American nuclear-powered ballistic-missile
submarines and to challenge the US regional presence overall. China
began conducting naval operations in the Arctic in 2015, when PLAN ships
sailed through the Bering Sea.143 More recently, the PLAN deployed
several ships close to the Aleutian Islands in September 2021.144 There
are also worrying signs that China might be interested in conducting
submarine operations in the Arctic: indeed, Beijing raised the topic
with Russia of stationing its submarines across the AZRF. 145 That would
leave the central Arctic Ocean at risk of contestation. Finally, Russia
suspects -- as do other Arctic states -- that Chinese Arctic bases and
expeditions are dual-use in nature. The PLAN could thus be broadening
its knowledge of the region, notably through intelligence-gathering and
domain awareness for military operations, under the guise of 'ocean
science' (including navigation, atmospheric conditions, and cold-water
and under-ice operations). In support of this research, China launched
its first polar observation satellite in 2019.146 China's presence in
the Arctic is increasingly at odds with Russia's current posture of
control, and the relationship is defined as much by competition as by
cooperation. Russia can use its influence as a 'gatekeeper' to the
Arctic for China and access provider to the NSR. However, the impact of
climate change and the potential opening of the projected Transpolar
Route in the central Arctic Ocean could render the NSR irrelevant for
Chinese commerce. For those reasons, 'China's role will determine the
future of the NSR'.147 Bilateral relations in Antarctica The South Pole
is also seeing increased interaction between Russia and China. China
became a consultative party to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
in 1985,148 which gave Beijing veto powers and, most importantly, the
right to make a territorial claim. Later, China became a CCAMLR member
in 2007 and defined its Antarctic policy priorities in a 2017 white
paper.149 Activities in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica have been
linked to the BRI, with the pragmatic aim of exploiting resources at the
South Pole on a 'first come, first served' basis. China operates the
largest distant fishing fleet in the world, giving it a particular
interest in fish stocks and marine resources.150 The growing number of
Chinese expeditions151 (including tourism) and surveys in Antarctica
also indicates an interest in exploiting natural resources there in the
long term -- mainly hydrocarbon reserves, rare earths and minerals, and
fresh water from ice. Russia and China have found common ground in
opposing the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Southern
Ocean under the CAMLR Convention. Both countries actively campaigned
against the creation of the Ross Sea MPA in 2016 and continue to block
the establishment of others. They also share the view that claimant
states could use the structures of the ATS -- in particular, CCAMLR --
to strengthen their claims over territory. Despite some level of
agreement between Russia and China over Antarctic affairs, the Kremlin
remains concerned regarding Beijing's policy of pre-emptive commercial
dominance in the Southern Ocean. As Moscow wants to take a defining role
in the future of the ATS, it cannot let China act without consulting
Russia first. Indeed, perhaps also reflecting future Russian intentions,
the Kremlin equates a Chinese presence at the South Pole with ambitions
to make territorial claims and achieve sovereign rights. This is
compounded by the fact that China could use its economic leverage over
South American claimants like Argentina152 or Chile to obtain
concessions over the management of the ATS.153 Like other countries,
Russia is also concerned that Chinese activities at the South Pole might
encompass military purposes. The PLA is increasingly involved in
Antarctic affairs, notably through the icebreaker programme.154
Furthermore, China installed Beidou satellite stations at the Great Wall
and Zhongshan bases in 2010, and at Kunlun/Dome A in 2013.155 As Beidou
stations also serve military purposes, there are risks that satellite
installations and remote-sensing capabilities could be used for
intelligence-gathering, surveillance and missile-tracking.156 Finally,
China is seeking to establish an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA)
around the Kunlun station within Dome A, the highest point on the
continent.157 An ASMA within Dome A would essentially create an
exclusion zone in which China could use its satellite station for
dual-use, ground-based satellite tracking.158 The proposal has so far
been rejected by other ATS members. 07 Conclusion and policy
recommendations Tension and miscalculation in polar affairs must be
managed by shaping Western policy around Russia's increasingly
militarized posture in the polar regions. Preserving the spirit of 'low
tension' in the Arctic and stability within the ATS will require
adjustments on the part of Western policymakers. The polar regions are
no longer insulated from the wider geopolitical challenges caused by
deteriorating Western relations with Russia. There is now an increased
risk that the current era of 'low tension' at both the North and South
Poles will come to an end. This geopoliticization of polar issues
presents a common thread: great power competition is slowly starting to
shape the way non-security issues -- including climate change -- are
framed and discussed, both in the Arctic and within the ATS. The
situation is now compounded by the growing role of China in polar
affairs: through its Polar Silk Road concept, Beijing is seeking to
disrupt polar governance norms. Heightened insecurity in polar affairs,
along with the potential for direct military competition, impacts the
security interests of the US, NATO and other Western nations. For
Russia, issues at both poles could become increasingly linked and could
push the Kremlin towards a more aggressive and militarized approach to
defend Russia's perceived national interests. While anticipating the
impact of climate change and future polar competition, Moscow is
thinking in terms of contingency planning. This means pre-empting the
consequences of rising tensions in the Arctic and positioning itself in
Antarctica to prepare for the future. Tension and miscalculation in
polar affairs must be managed by taking stock of Russia's increasingly
militarized posture in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. To that end,
this paper offers the following general and targeted policy
recommendations for Western policymakers: Develop Arctic and Antarctic
policies in conjunction --- Western analysis should systematically take
into account the interdependence between Arctic and Antarctic policies.
While Russia might not have (yet) established an overarching polar
strategy, other potential disruptors like China have done so. Thinking
in those terms will help Western governments to establish a more
comprehensive picture of the polar security environment. --- Similarly,
patterns of cooperation in both poles should be more thoroughly
discussed by Arctic and Antarctic stakeholders to understand and
replicate lessons learned and best practices (for example, incidents at
sea (INCSEA) agreements in the Arctic or marine bio-conservation
measures in Antarctica). Prevent insecurity from driving polar politics
--- Geopolitical tension is not inevitable in the polar regions, nor
should it become a self-fulfilling prophecy. At the level of official
state rhetoric, policymakers engaged in polar politics must avoid
bombastic statements.159 These are harmful and erode the spirit of
cooperation in both regions. Change the analytical approach to Russia's
posture in the Arctic --- The 'double dual' nature (see Chapter 1) of
Russian military infrastructure and capabilities in the Arctic is
blurring the line between offensive and defensive purposes. The
remilitarization of the Russian Arctic therefore becomes both defensive
in nature and offensive in intent, as Moscow plans for all contingencies
including escalation. This situation is compounded by risks linked to
horizontal escalation to and from the Arctic theatre.

Manage tension with Russia in the Arctic --- Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has shattered all hopes of
continued cooperation with the Kremlin in the context of Russia's
chairmanship of the Arctic Council and the Arctic Coast Guard Forum
until May 2023. Indeed, in early March 2022, the so-called 'Arctic 7'
(Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the US) condemned
Russia's aggression and unanimously paused their participation in all
Arctic Council meetings.160 --- The risk for Arctic nations is that
Russia might pivot to a wider variety of more 'friendly' states
interested in Arctic affairs, such as India or the United Arab
Emirates,161 to leverage its interests and break out of its current
isolation in international affairs. --- Any opportunity that existed to
constructively engage Moscow in parallel discussions over military
security in the Arctic has now gone. Russia cannot be allowed to rejoin
the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable or the Arctic Chiefs of Defence
Staff meetings -- at least for as long as the current leadership remains
in the Kremlin. --- Creating a new framework to engage with Russia on
military security issues in the Arctic would also be ill-advised. It is
doubtful that Russia can be trusted to implement existing regional
agreements, including bilateral INCSEA agreements. Create a military
security architecture for the Arctic --- With Russia's renewed war in
Ukraine in mind, the Arctic 7 will now have to deal increasingly with
the risk of miscalculation and tactical errors, even in day-to-day 'soft
security' activities such as patrols and constabulary missions or SAR.
This is especially relevant in the context of the Finnish and Swedish
applications to join NATO and the likely expansion of the alliance. ---
It is vital now that the Arctic 7 define the 'rules of the road' for
military activity in the region, exploring the continuum between
military and 'soft security' affairs, creating Arctic-specific
military-to-military channels of communication and properly defining the
role of NATO in the European Arctic.162 Avoid a 'FONOP vicious circle'

The links between China's polar research programs and the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) have sparked concerns over potential security
threats in the Arctic. A key example of this occurred with Sweden, where
China established its first overseas satellite ground station at the
Esrange Space Center near Kiruna in 2016. In 2020, the Swedish Space
Corporation (SSC), which oversees Esrange, chose not to renew its
contracts with China due to fears that the facility could support
military intelligence and surveillance operations. This decision
extended beyond Esrange, affecting China's access to other SSC-managed
ground stations in South America and Australia. However, the exact
timeline for contract expirations and whether China's access to the
stations has been completely revoked remains uncertain. DoD leadership
has echoed these security concerns. A 2019 DoD report warned that
China's civilian research could contribute to an expanded military
presence in the Arctic, while the 2022 U.S. administration's Arctic
strategy highlighted China's use of scientific activities for dual-use
research with military and intelligence applications.\[1\],\[16\]

China's Science of Military Strategy asserts that military-civilian
pursuits are the path to polar power, and implementing dual-use
applications of polar science will assist in achieving it. For example,
it is believed the polar observation satellites, under the auspices of
providing polar ice assessments, are also being used to provide
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) to the PLA. Another
example of this dual-use is the scientific application of weather
balloons to provide data on upper atmospheric conditions, which the PLA
also uses for ISR and command and control. Acknowledging these growing
concerns, several countries and governmental bodies (Canada, the
European Commission) have passed legislation and regulatory measures
limiting (or ending) China's investment in their regional
infrastructure. The DoD published the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy, nested
under the 2022 National Security Strategy, addresses its intentions and
potential moves to combat this growing area of
concern.\[10\],\[17\],\[18\]

**[China's]{.underline}** continued [[expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}
into the Arctic has also [[created a **geopolitical destabilizing**
alliance]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline}. China has long seen Russia as
a key entry point into the Arctic, though the latter has historically
resisted its growing presence due to national security concerns. Moscow
initially opposed China's observer status in the Arctic Council and
restricted its research activities along the Northern Sea Route.
However, the war in [[**Ukraine** has left Russia]{.mark} increasingly
**[isolated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[making it more **dependent** on
**Chinese**]{.mark} investments in **infrastructure** and
**tech**nology]{.underline}. As the Arctic Council faces uncertainty,
China has deepened its strategic focus on Russian ports. In 2019,
Chinese academics from two (2) state universities conducted studies to
identify which Russian key access points along the Northern Sea Route
gave the most access to the region. The report ranked 13 Russian ports
based on five (5) primary factors: natural conditions, infrastructure,
port operation, interior environment, and geographic location. Since the
release of the report, Beijing has invested approximately \$130 billion
in the infrastructure of the ports.\[1\],\[19\]

Conclusion

While China officially frames its Antarctic expansion as purely
scientific, the dual-use potential of its research stations, logistical
infrastructure, and technological capabilities raises questions about
its broader ambitions. The completion of Qinling Station in 2024 and the
upcoming sixth research station in 2025 are significant steps in China's
long-term Antarctic strategy, increasing its presence near key
geopolitical locations. With growing tensions between Washington and
Beijing and concerns over the future of the ATS, China's Antarctic
expansion represents a critical geopolitical development that will shape
the future of polar governance, global strategic competition, and
scientific research in one of the world's last frontiers.\[20\],\[8\]

The 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy states that climate change and shifts in
the geostrategic environment propel the need for a new approach to the
Arctic. [[China's **growing presence**]{.underline}]{.mark} there is
[driven by **long-term** strategic objectives]{.underline} that
[[go]{.mark} far [beyond]{.mark} **scientific
[research]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By leveraging economic partnerships,
scientific research, and infrastructure investments, [**Beijing** is
actively [positioning itself as a **major player** in Arctic]{.mark}
governance]{.underline}, [**resource** extraction]{.underline}, [and
commercial **shipping**]{.underline}. However, its [ambitions are
increasingly met with **resistance** from Arctic nations]{.underline},
particularly the U.S., Canada, and Nordic countries. They fear China's
Arctic engagement may be a precursor to greater geopolitical and
military involvement. As the Arctic continues to thaw, [China's role in
shaping the **future**]{.underline} of the region will be a major point
of contention in global politics, one that [[will likely **escalate** as
competition over **resources**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[trade]{.mark}**
routes]{.underline}, [[and **strategic influence**
intensifies]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[10\],\[21\]

partnership presents an existential threat to the US,"
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/five-reasons-why-growing-russia-china-strategic-partnership-presents-existential-threat-to-us\]
lucao

Here are five reasons why the [**[Russia-China]{.mark}** strategic
tandem [poses]{.mark} an [**existential** threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the U.S.

1\. [Both [regimes]{.mark} have [masterminded]{.mark} long-range
[strategies]{.mark} to **[destabilize]{.mark}** American
[society]{.mark} through **espionage**]{.underline}, [covert **influence
op**eration**s**]{.underline}, subversion and **[election
interference]{.underline}**. Whether it is **[Confucius]{.underline}**
Institutes [indoctrinating American students or deep cover agents
**infiltrated** by Russian intelligence]{.underline} to the U.S., [these
**[threats]{.mark}** are hard to detect and
**[neutralize]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in a [**democratic**
society]{.mark}]{.underline}. These operatives steal U.S. secrets,
cultivate access to influential persons, and infiltrate business,
political, and activist groups, with the goal of fomenting discord and
[**[transform]{.mark}**ing America [into]{.mark} an [**undemocratic**
authoritarian state]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2\. [[**Russia** and **China**]{.mark} developed doctrines that [seek to
**defeat** America]{.mark}]{.underline} on the battlefield, should
Washington intervene in a regional conflict, such as the war in Ukraine
or a potential attack against Taiwan. However, [if **Moscow** and
**Beijing** synchronize the timing of their **combat
op**eration**s**]{.underline}, 21. Officially, the Pentagon's \"two-war
doctrine\" is designed to deal with such a threat. However, concerns
about [the **[depletion]{.mark}** of [U.S. weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}
supplies as a result of expanding shipments to Ukraine, coupled with
Washington's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[casts **doubt** on
U.S. forces]{.mark}' combat **readiness**]{.underline} [[to fight in
**two theaters**]{.underline}]{.mark} simultaneously.

Russia and China may even step in to help each other in a conflict if
either faces defeat by NATO. They have been practicing joint combat
drills since 2005. Most recently, \"Vostok-2022\" simulated a
Russia-China \"joint special operation,\" responding to the perceived
threat from Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. Such joint military
planning augments interoperability between the two militaries.

Nuclear warfare is a potential component of Moscow and Beijing's battle
plan. [**[Russia's]{.mark}** post-Cold War doctrine no longer views
**nuc**lear weapon**s** as psychological **deterrent**]{.underline} to
avert a catastrophic conflict, but rather as a battlefield capability
that [**Moscow** is [prepared to use to **stave off** U.S.
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline} in a regional crisis or defeat by NATO
forces. [**Russia** already [holds advantage over the U.S. in
**t**]{.mark}actical **[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**China** is pursuing
the **largest**]{.mark} ever [nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} force
**[[expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}** in its history, while the U.S. ICBM
force is in need of modernization, not being able to counter new missile
defense technologies.

3\. [Both **[adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[identified
America's reliance on **tech**]{.mark}nology [as]{.mark} a critical
**[vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline} to be exploited.
[Both]{.underline} have [[developed **cyber-attack** and
**space**]{.mark} warfare]{.underline} doctrines and weapons
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} degrade or [**[destroy]{.mark}** U.S. military
and civilian **[networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Critical]{.mark}**
U.S. **[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from banking and
transportation to hospitals and nuclear plants, [[are
**vulnerable**]{.mark} to attacks]{.underline}. Having realized the
problem, the Pentagon is holding classified deliberations regarding the
threat of China and Russia\'s space weapons.

4\. The Russia-China [accelerating **economic coop**eration is boosted
by their forecasts]{.underline} that the center of gravity in
international commerce and investment is moving to Asia. The [[two
nations]{.mark} have already [**set up** a method to]{.mark} make
bilateral transact]{.underline}ions in rubles or yuan instead of euros
or dollars, [**[bypass]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} the Western [[**SWIFT**
system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Plans are underway to integrate China's
Belt & Road Initiative with Russia's Eurasian Economic Union. This
[**trend** plays into China's **long-range** goal of [replacing the
dollar with **Chinese yuan**]{.mark} as the preferred **international**
reserves currency]{.underline}. Other authoritarian regimes, which seek
to decouple business from human rights, will likely favor an
international transactions alternative.

In the meantime, China is providing a critical economic lifeline to
Russia which is hit by stringent Western sanctions. China's trade with
Russia and Moscow's energy exports to Beijing are surging. The massive
joint \$55-billion pipeline, the Power of Siberia, already sends Russian
gas to parts of China and will become fully operational in 2025. With
these new revenue streams, Russia may decide not re-open Nord Stream,
the main natural gas pipeline to Europe, which Moscow recently shut
down.

5\. To be clear, [Russia and China are not **natural
allies**]{.underline}. They share a tumultuous history full of border
disputes, cultural prejudices, and suspicions. However, [they are
**[united]{.mark}** by a common cause]{.underline}, having aligned their
[**[aggressive policies]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} diminish America's role in
the world and [promote an **authoritarian** system]{.mark} of
governance]{.underline}. Moreover, Putin and Xi enjoy a comfortable
relationship. While not exactly friends, they see eye to eye on many
issues, having adopted a pragmatic and non-confrontational approach to
dealing with each other. They project mutually while being engaged in a
raw pursuit of national interests and the survivability of their
regimes.

What makes this strategic tandem more dangerous is that both men have
clearly laid out their anti-U.S. strategic ambitions. [**Putin** [seeks
to rebuild a **USSR-like** alliance in Eurasia]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[**Xi** is implementing the century-old]{.underline} \"**[China
Dream]{.underline}**\" [concept of **economic prosperity** and
**military strength**]{.underline}. In line with it, Xi is taking China
along the \"Road to Rejuvenation\" to turn it into the dominant global
power, supplanting the U.S. by 2049, the centennial anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China.

What To Know

\"[[**China** is very important]{.underline}]{.mark} to us, [[and we are
eager to **strengthen**]{.mark} our
**[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline},\"
**[[Motzfeldt]{.underline}]{.mark}** told Xinhua.

Motzfeldt said she had [made a **memorable** trip to China]{.underline}
in 2023 and noted that China was already one of Greenland\'s largest
markets for seafood exports. Motzfeldt formally [[opened Greenland\'s
**representative office** in Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2023 within
the Danish embassy.

Recent ideas of the U.S. acquiring Greenland were first floated during
Trump\'s presidency in 2019, when administration officials approached
Greenlandic leaders with promises of billions of dollars in investment.

But American interest in Greenland dates back more than a century.

In a testimony to Congress in February, Alexander B. Gray, a Senior
Fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington and a senior
security official in President Trump\'s first administration said, \"The
security stakes are simply too high to allow Greenland to obtain
independence without a plan in place for the U.S. to ensure our core
strategic interests are assured.\"

What We Know

The [[growing relationship]{.mark} with **China**]{.underline} may
[serve as a **[counterweight]{.mark}** to mounting [U.S.
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. A modern offer from the U.S. to buy
Greenland could exceed \$2.2 billion according to some estimates.

**[Greenland]{.underline}**, home to around 56,000 people, [has
**strategic importance** due to its location in the Arctic]{.underline},
significant [reserves of **r**are **e**arth
**m**ineral**s**]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline} presence of
[**Pituffik** Space Base]{.underline} -- formerly Thule Air Base.
Although Denmark oversees foreign and defense policy, Greenland has
steadily expanded its self-rule since gaining home rule in 1979.

What People Are Saying

Aqqalu **[Jerimiassen]{.underline}**, [chairman of the **Atassut** party
and]{.underline} a [member of the **[Greenlandic
Parliament]{.mark}**]{.underline}, quoted by Xinhua: \"I\'ve been to
Beijing, Guangzhou and several other cities\... I [[was]{.mark} very
**[impressed]{.mark}** during my visit to **China**]{.underline}. I was
particularly [[**interested** in]{.underline}]{.mark} how we can build
good [**[coop]{.mark}**eration [with Chinese]{.mark} enterprises and
**[authorities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

President Donald Trump: \"We\'ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100 percent.\"

China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian: \"On the issue of
Greenland, [**China** always believes that **relations** between
countries should be handled in **accordance** with the purposes and
principles of the **U.N. Charter**]{.underline}.\"

Some [modes of the [**PRC** presence]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic

[involvement of Chinese **[construction]{.mark}** companies]{.underline}

[**[Beijing]{.mark}** has been increasingly involved in

them [[that China is]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[not]{.mark} a

Interestingly, **[China]{.underline}** is broadly in accord with the
U.S. position; but, as is its wont, the country [is playing the **long
game**]{.underline}. Notwithstanding Trump's talk of [[Chinese
**gunships** off Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, Beijing's interest in
the Arctic thus far appears to be entirely mercantilist. Particularly
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's [[invasion of
**Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [China [is the only country whose
**commercial vessels** transit the **NSR**]{.mark} with some
regularity]{.underline}. In 2012 the [[Chinese

**feasibility** of crossing]{.mark} from Atlantic to

threats are far more urgent. While the rest of the world is not heating
up as rapidly as the Arctic, it is still warming. And a world that has
warmed enough for the Arctic Ocean to be truly ice-free is a world that
will be experiencing even more droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and other
extreme weather events, at the potential cost of millions upon millions
of dollars in damage and extensive loss of life.

### Climate Leadership\-\--AT: Chinese Takeover\-\--2AC

#### Structural factors prevent Chinese [take-over]{.underline}. 

**Gang '25** \[Chen; April 8; Deputy Director (Policy Research) and

short of global leadership,"

lucao

The [global **climate leadership** landscape has been in
**flux**]{.underline}, particularly ever [since]{.underline} US
President Donald [Trump]{.underline} [announced the
**withdrawal**]{.underline} of his country [from the **Paris**
agreement]{.underline} yet again. The shift left a leadership vacuum
that many expected China to fill, given its significant investments in
renewable energy and its ambitious net zero goal. [However]{.underline},
recent developments, including China's missed emission targets in 2024,
suggest that [**China** may not yet be ready to assume the mantle of
global **climate leadership**]{.underline}.

Difficult balancing act: economy and environmental commitments

[China's **climate strategy**]{.underline} has been [characterised by
**ambitious** pledges]{.underline}, such as achieving [carbon
**neutrality** by 2060 and **peak**ing carbon]{.underline}
**[emissions]{.underline}** [before 2030]{.underline}. [These
commitments are supported by]{.underline} substantial [investments in
**renewable**]{.underline} energy technologies, [positioning China as a
**leader**]{.underline} in the global green transition effort. However,
the [**reality** of meeting these targets has proven
**challenging**]{.underline}.

This shortfall underscores the difficulties China faces in balancing its
economic growth with its environmental commitments.

In 2024, [China's **carbon intensity**]{.underline}, a [measurement of
carbon **emissions** per]{.underline} unit of [**g**ross **d**omestic
**p**roduct]{.underline} (GDP), fell by only 3.4%, [missing the
**official target**]{.underline} of 3.9%. [China is also behind its
**five-year** goal of slashing **carbon intensity**]{.underline} by 18%
between 2020 and 2025.

This [shortfall underscores]{.underline} the [difficulties China faces
in balancing its economic growth with its environmental
commitments]{.underline}. As China's [**GDP** is
**decelerating**]{.underline}, the [government needs to cut emissions
more **aggressively** to achieve]{.underline} the carbon intensity
**[target]{.underline}** set previously.

In recent years, the [reliance on **industrial growth**]{.underline} to
recover from the economic repercussions [of the **Covid**-19
pandemic]{.underline} has [led to increased **energy demand**
and]{.underline}, consequently, [higher **emissions**]{.underline} in
China. This situation is compounded by domestic coal consumption, which
remains a significant barrier to its climate leadership aspirations.

Despite pledges to halt overseas coal projects, [domestic **coal
burning** still accounts for **more than half** of China's energy
consumption and **two-thirds** of]{.underline} its [electricity
output]{.underline}. This reliance on coal poses a challenge to China's
ability to drastically reduce emissions and transition to cleaner energy
sources.

Emerging as the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) market and
producer, [**China** needs to charge its **EVs** with electricity from
**renewable** sources like wind and solar rather than **coal
burning**]{.underline}. [Otherwise]{.underline}, the [carbon
**footprints**]{.underline} of these EVs [may be even larger than cars
with **gas**oline **engines**]{.underline}.

Achieving carbon neutrality will require significant reforms in China's
energy sector and broader economy, which may not occur until after 2035.

Significant reforms needed

While China has made remarkable achievements in the development of
renewable energy like wind, solar and hydro power, the pace of
structural changes needed to fully transition away from coal is far from
satisfactory. Achieving carbon neutrality will require significant
reforms in China's energy sector and broader economy, which may not
occur until after 2035. This timeline raises questions about China's
ability to lead global climate efforts in the near term.

Despite the current US administration's climate position, it is
important for China to maintain climate and energy cooperation with the
US and the EU, which helps the country improve its image and potentially
seek global leadership. However, China's current domestic challenges and
missed targets indicate that it may not yet be ready to fully assume
this role. The international community will continue to closely watch
China's mitigation actions, as its success or failure will have
significant implications for global efforts to combat climate change.

Moreover, China's geopolitical strategies and economic policies add
complexity to its climate leadership ambitions. The Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), while promoting infrastructure development, has been
criticised for supporting projects that may not align with global
mitigation or adaptation goals. The initiative's prioritisation of
economic expansion sometimes overshadows environmental considerations,
posing a challenge to China's ability to lead by example in climate
efforts.

Domestic concerns may impede China's global climate leadership role

China's approach to climate leadership is further complicated by its
domestic socioeconomic priorities. Although the key is to have
sustainable and green growth, the government's need to maintain a 5% GDP
growth in 2025 may take precedence over environmental concerns. This
prioritisation can lead to policy decisions that favour short-term
economic gains over long-term sustainability, affecting China's
credibility as a climate leader. Lack of an active civil society that
supports environmental activism and supervises government and corporate
behaviours is weakening the country's ability to take costly but
necessary mitigation actions.

China, with the world's second largest computing power scale, witnesses
an annual growth of 15% in its data centres' power usage, which accounts
for about 4% of the national electricity consumption in 2025.

Additionally, the energy and environmental impact of China's
technological advancements in AI-driven solutions is contingent on the
integration of more low-carbon energy into the local energy networks.
China, with the world's second largest computing power scale, witnesses
an annual growth of 15% in its data centres' power usage, which accounts
for about 4% of the national electricity consumption in 2025.

Paradoxically, the role of AI in optimising intermittent renewable
energy supply and improving energy efficiency is also a critical
component of China's climate strategy.

AI advancements could aid climate adaptation and mitigation

China's technological advancements in AI offer potential solutions for
climate adaptation and mitigation. AI can optimise renewable energy
production, improve energy efficiency and provide actionable insights
for governance, enabling data-driven policymaking for more effective
interventions aimed at addressing inclusive growth issues. This scalable
model for energy efficiency shows promise, but its implementation on a
national scale in China is still nascent.

China's collaboration with other nations is crucial for the country's
climate leadership. Engaging China for sustainability in Asia requires
partnership and cooperation among Asian and Western economies.
Solidifying mutual trust through cooperation on shared interests like
climate change and green economic transition is essential for China to
enhance its leadership role.

With the absence of the US, global actions against climate change
urgently need the unity and consensus between China and other major
players like the EU and ASEAN. China needs to kickstart strategic
dialogues with these blocs on climate and energy issues as soon as
possible.

China's interest in low-carbon energy sectors in Southeast Asia a boon

China's ambition to become a major provider of capital, construction
services, and equipment to low-carbon energy sectors in Southeast Asia
is another facet of its potential climate leadership. Chinese companies
have been active in energy-related construction services, equipment, and
investments in conventional energy projects, including low-carbon
hydropower and grid construction. The transition from conventional to
new energy projects has just started, and the pace of this transition
will significantly impact China's ability to lead in global climate
efforts.

While China has made strides in green transition, its missed emissions
targets and ongoing reliance on coal suggest that it is still not
prepared to take on global climate leadership.

The falling costs of solar and wind energy, partly driven by low-cost
manufacturing of related products in China, have energised the expansion
of renewables globally. This trend has been particularly evident in many
Western countries, where the cost of installing solar and wind
generators has decreased significantly, making them more competitive
with traditional energy sources. China's role in driving down these
costs highlights its potential to influence global renewable energy
markets positively. Nevertheless, the tariffs levied by President Trump
are complicating the global supply chain issue and weakening China's
role as the major supplier of renewable energy equipment.

While China has made strides in green transition, its missed emissions
targets and ongoing reliance on coal suggest that it is still not
prepared to take on global climate leadership. The international
community needs to press China for more aggressive actions home and
abroad, as its success or failure will have significant implications for
global efforts to combat climate change. China's journey towards climate
leadership is a complex interplay of domestic challenges, technological
advancements and international relations, all of which must be navigated
carefully to achieve substantial progress.

Donald [**Trump**'s return to the **White House**]{.underline} has

continues to warm --- this January was the warmest on record, and 2024

**[breakthroughs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [steep [learning **curves** and
plummeting **costs**]{.mark}]{.underline} have [made clean energy
sources **cheaper**]{.underline} than fossil fuels in most places. And
whereas in 2017 the revolution was just getting started, by now it has
reached escape velocity. This momentum is being driven not by politics
or government intervention but by markets. That [[deep-red Texas leads

case in point: [[**politics** will no longer **hold back**]{.mark} the
American **energy [transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\... no edicts from Washington can halt the forward movement of the US
energy transition.

Slowing but not halting the energy transition

That's not to say that politics won't slow the transition. In the US,
the Trump administration is already taking steps to loosen environmental
and climate regulations, promote domestic oil and gas production,
support the outlook for gas-fired power plants, and end clean-energy and
EV-adoption incentives. The president's day one executive orders
expanded the federal lands available for oil and gas leasing, reversed
former president Joe Biden's suspension of new LNG terminal approvals,
and paused new wind projects on federal land and water. Aided by
Republican majorities in Congress, Trump will look to repeal roughly
half of the Inflation Reduction Act's footprint, including support for
EVs and offshore wind as well as the Investment Tax Credits and
Production Tax Credits.

Yet no edicts from Washington can halt the forward movement of the US
energy transition. Despite Trump's claims of a "national energy
emergency", [the **US** has been a **net energy** exporter since
2019]{.underline} and [already produces more **oil** than any country in
history]{.underline}. But with [[prices low and]{.mark} US oil and gas
**[output]{.mark}**]{.underline} already [[at record
levels]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[fossil fuel]{.underline}]{.mark}**
production [[will **struggle**]{.mark} to go much higher]{.underline} in
the near term --- no matter what Trump does.

The deployment of clean energy will therefore continue, driven by
increasing power demand and declining costs --- especially for solar
energy. American electric utilities will still pursue aggressive
renewable buildouts to keep pace with rising energy use and ensure grid
adequacy, even as new gas-fired power plants expand, too. US automakers
will not abandon their long-term EV plans, even as the Trump
administration removes EV incentives and charging infrastructure
funding. And Democratic-controlled states will continue pursuing
ambitious decarbonisation policies as they did during Trump's first
term.

Clean energy push will continue

Perhaps more importantly, meaningful parts of the Inflation Reduction
Act of 2022 (**[[IRA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) will [[remain in
place]{.mark} because]{.underline} of their **[political
support]{.underline}** with Republican constituencies, which have
benefitted disproportionately from the investments and job creation it
has created. [[Next-generation **clean energy**]{.underline}]{.mark}
technologies such as nuclear, geothermal and carbon capture and storage
[[will **continue** receiving support]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Most critically, China --- the largest source of global emissions --- is
set to reach an emissions peak five years ahead of its previously stated
2030 target.

America's retreat from global climate leadership will have significant
but not fatal implications for the pace of the energy transition abroad.
[**Trump**'s]{.underline} decision to [pull the US out of]{.underline}
the **[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement again and [withdraw funding
from]{.underline} the [**UN F**ramework **C**onvention on Climate
Change]{.underline} will reduce climate finance flows for emerging
economies, dampen their enthusiasm for accelerated climate action and
encourage some like Argentina and Indonesia to follow Trump's lead.

But just as the US transition is unstoppable, so, too, is [the
**global** transition]{.underline}. Industrialised countries other than
the US will [remain broadly committed to the **Paris**]{.underline}
Agreement. Europe views the energy transition as a way to reduce its
import reliance and improve its energy security. While India, the
world's fastest-growing emitter, sees decarbonisation as an economic
opportunity and a necessary step to reduce some of the world's worst air
pollution. And most other emerging markets are eager to accelerate their
renewables deployments for purely economic reasons. [Most
critically]{.underline}, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [the
largest source of global emissions]{.underline} --- [is [set to reach an
**emissions peak** five years ahead of]{.mark} its previously stated
**[2030]{.mark}**]{.underline} target.

China going full speed ahead

[[**Chinese manufacturers** in technologies]{.mark} like **solar
panels**]{.underline}, [**EVs** and **batteries**]{.underline} --- which
[[already **dominate** global supply chains]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
also [won't abandon their **expansion ambitions**]{.underline} because
of changes in US demand or market access. If anything, they see the
Trump administration's policies as an opportunity to gain global market
share, speeding global adoption of these technologies and driving
further price declines. While the US falls further behind China in clean
energy, the continuing drop in renewable power costs will encourage more
emerging markets to adopt cheaper domestic renewables like solar and
wind over volatile imported fossil fuels.

The [**[econ]{.mark}**omic [and **tech**]{.mark}nological [forces
driving]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[clean energy]{.mark}** revolution
[have]{.mark} simply [become **too powerful** for any single
country]{.mark}]{.underline} --- even the US --- or president --- even
Trump --- [[to **stop**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The global transition will
power forward, even if the journey includes a few more bumps along the
way.

## Solvency

### Solvency\-\--2AC

#### Greenland-US partnership [solves]{.underline}. 

Naaja **Nathanielsen 25**, Minister of Business, Trade, and Mineral
Resources in the government of Greenland, 1/16/2025, \"Greenland does
not want to be part of the U.S., but we are open for business,\"
Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/01/16/greenland-minerals-american-investment/

The past weeks have brought Greenland back into the spotlight. This
attention provides an occasion to highlight business opportunities in
our country. We are a highly skilled and rules-based market economy, and
our strategic location is vital for North Atlantic maritime, aviation
and space-based activities. We invite more American businesses to engage
in the vast potential of our economy.

**[R]{.underline}**are **[e]{.underline}**arth
**[e]{.underline}**lement[**s** are in abundance in Greenland and play a
decisive role in]{.underline} the [development of electric motors and
components]{.underline} used in batteries and solar panels. Greenland
possesses 39 of the 50 minerals that the United States has classified as
critical to national security and economic stability. These minerals,
which include rare earth elements as well as copper, zinc and nickel,
are essential to modern technology.

Globally, the [mining market for rare earth elements is dominated by
China]{.underline}, which accounts for about two-thirds of the world's
production. This dominance creates a strategic vulnerability for many
countries. [Greenland can be a **solution** to this problem]{.underline}
by diversifying the sources of these minerals.

Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, but has its own government
and parliament and full jurisdiction over our many natural resources.
[There exists]{.underline} a [general political consensus in **favor**
of developing]{.underline} our **[mineral sector]{.underline}**. The one
exception is the mining of uranium, which is banned by law.
**[Bilateral]{.underline}** and multilateral [**partnerships** are
essential for]{.underline} the [further development of the country's
many attractive mineral projects]{.underline}.

[The **big obstacle** to development]{.underline} of Greenland's mineral
resources [is a lack of capital. Mining is slow business]{.underline}.
The time frame from the early stages of exploration to the actual
shipment of minerals can stretch over more than two decades, on average
16 years. This [requires **capital**]{.underline} that is [willing to
commit to long-term investments at a high risk]{.underline}. At present,
we are asking private investors to bear this burden alone. [We must find
solutions to bridge]{.underline} the [gap between capital, political
ambitions and industry needs]{.underline}. If not, we risk that the
minerals stay in the ground.

So, [Greenland is asking mineral-importing countries to lend these
mining projects a helping hand, for our mutual benefit]{.underline}. We
have joined an international collaboration between mineral importing and
exporting countries that aims to ensure a stable and responsible supply
of critical minerals. In this partnership, [we have found]{.underline}
the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to be a
constructive and supportive companion]{.underline}.

[Greenland has been collaborating with]{.underline} the [U.S. State
Department for several years to provide new knowledge about our critical
minerals]{.underline}. The latest agreement between our countries was
signed in 2019, halfway through the first Trump administration. This
agreement included a mapping campaign to investigate the potential for
mining graphite; funds to carry out a direct marketing campaign aimed at
relevant investors and major mining companies; and sharing know-how.

[Greenland has high hopes of signing a **new agreement** with the United
States **as soon as possible**]{.underline}. We are searching for ways
to increase investments in our mining sector. [Instruments such as
direct investments, direct loans, loan guarantees or access to
development banks would be of **massive importance** to
help]{.underline} the [projects get off the ground. Investments in
infrastructure connected to]{.underline} the projects could also be of
great value and help relieve some of the pressure in the first difficult
years of a mining project's lifespan. [Often]{.underline} a [project
will need roads and a harbor]{.underline}, as the seaways are our
primary means of transportation.

At the moment, [companies in Canada and Britain own]{.underline} the
[most mining licenses in Greenland. They each hold 23 licenses. The
United States holds **just one**. I am sure this]{.underline} picture
[can change]{.underline}. There are existing, upcoming and as yet
unknown possibilities available for investments.

As our prime minister has stated clearly, Greenland belongs to the
people of Greenland. We do not want to be part of the United States. We
are not Danes, nor Americans. But we see ample opportunities to make a
deal that could benefit both of our countries. The [potential for
developing]{.underline} the [Greenlandic economy is **enormous**. We
have high environmental standards, we have sound regulations that
include public hearings and local involvement, and we have]{.underline}
an [**amazing geological resource**. And we invite]{.underline} the
[United States to join us with much more business
cooperation]{.underline}.

#### Greenland is a necessary and strategic investment -- action is required NOW

**Berbrick '25** \[Walter, February 5; Former Naval War College Arctic

When President Trump again proposed buying Greenland, the world laughed.
But beneath the headlines was a spot-on strategic instinct. [Greenland
is a rapidly rising geopolitical heav2yweight the **[U.S. cannot afford
to ignore]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.  ]{.underline}**

[As Russia expands its]{.mark} Arctic [military]{.mark} footprint [and
China pours billions into]{.mark} securing long-term access to [the
Arctic region]{.mark}, Greenland is steadily moving toward independence.
[The real question isn't **[whether the U.S. should engage, but
how]{.underline}** --- and [whether we will act before Beijing or Moscow
fills the void.]{.underline}]{.mark}[ ]{.underline}

To secure U.S. leadership in the Arctic, [Congress must move beyond
symbolic gestures and **[adopt a bold,]{.underline}** bipartisan
**[strategy]{.underline}** that deepens U.S.-Greenland ties]{.mark},
strengthens Arctic security, and lays the groundwork for Greenland's
eventual NATO membership.  

[Russia and China aren't waiting around in the Arctic, and neither
should the U.S]{.mark}. Moscow is ramping up its military presence with
new bases, nuclear-capable missiles and its most capable naval fleet. At
the same time, Beijing is building more nuclear-powered icebreakers,
pouring billions into dual-use Arctic research and infrastructure and
sailing its Navy further north.  

[Right in the middle of it all is Greenland --- a resource-rich island
with enormous strategic value to the U.S. and NATO.  ]{.underline}

### Inherency\-\--2AC

#### Trump [refused the plan]{.underline}.

Trump's focus on Greenland comes as the miles-thick ice sheet covering
much of the island is melting, potentially making it easier to drill and
dig for those lucrative deposits. American rivals are also growing more
assertive in the Arctic, which Pentagon officials have long warned could
be a new vulnerability for the West in a warmer world. [[The U.S. has
had a military base in northwestern Greenland since
1943.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Trump said at a press briefing shortly before taking office that the
U.S. needs to gain full control of Greenland for reasons related to
"national security" and "economic security," without elaborating on how
such a move would benefit the American military or domestic economy.

"I'm talking about protecting the free world," Trump said when asked
about his plans for Greenland. "You have China ships all over the place.
You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that
happen."

[[Trump rejected an offer earlier this month from Danish Prime
Minister]{.mark} Mette Frederiksen [of more cooperation on military
bases and mineral exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} insisting
that Denmark give up its territory, the Financial Times reported last
week. Frederiksen has since been on a diplomatic blitz across Europe to
shore up support for maintaining its territorial integrity.

"**[[There must be respect for territory and the sovereignty of
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**," the Danish leader said Tuesday,
alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. "This is an absolutely crucial
cornerstone of the international world order we have built since World
War II."

### Cooperation Key\-\--2AC

#### Trump must work with leaders of Greenland to be able to mine

**Hiar '25** \[Corbin and Hannah Northey; January 31; Award-winning

[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [officials have for more than a century
viewed Greenland's vast deposits of oil, gas and critical minerals as a
treasure chest]{.mark}]{.underline} that's [waiting to be
opened]{.mark}, government documents show.

But the challenge of unlocking those riches from the rugged, ice-covered
island consistently has stymied the development efforts of ambitious
mining firms and some of the world's largest oil companies.

Now, President Donald Trump is reviving an old idea with a new
geopolitical twist: [To prevent greater Chinese control of the Arctic
and rare earth minerals market,]{.underline} the U.S. would take over
the Danish territory --- by buying or seizing it. [[Trump's strong-arm
tactics]{.mark} toward Denmark [have sent shock waves through
Eu]{.mark}rope [and]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic
[T]{.mark}reaty [O]{.mark}rganization defense alliance]{.underline},
while industry analysts have been left scratching their heads.

[[If Trump intends to secure U.S. access to those resources and to newly
navigable]{.mark} Arctic [shipping routes]{.mark}, analysts argued,
**[it]{.mark} likely [would be easier to accomplish those goals by
working with leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Nuuk, the capital **[[of
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In places like Alaska, [[companies have overcome harsh conditions to
develop natural resources "if the price is right]{.underline},]{.mark}"
Finch added.

But there could also be value in ensuring that China doesn't gain access
to the island's energy assets, according to Christiansen, the Danish
geologist. Beijing already controls the world's largest reserves of rare
earth minerals and has previously sought to open a mine on the island.

"[[The nightmare scenario for Trump is that Chinese companies get
licenses in Greenland]{.mark},"]{.underline} he said. "Keep out China
--- that is the key issue at the moment."

[[Trump could]{.mark} still [increase military and economic cooperation
with Greenland without taking it over]{.mark}]{.underline}, Christiansen
added.

[**[The best way]{.mark}** to protect American interests on the island
**"[is to have a close dialogue between the U.S., Denmark and
Greenland,]{.mark}"**]{.underline} he said.

### Greenland Says Yes\-\--2AC

#### Greenland wants to trade with us -- Both sides gain

business consultant; Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress
(CSPC); "Untapped Potential: Exploring the Benefits of a U.S.- Greenland
Trade Agreement"; https://www.thepresidency.org/us-greenland-trade\]

[[Greenland wants a trade agreement with the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. An [[agreement could catalyze new
investment]{.underline}]{.mark}, which the government is actively
seeking to fulfill its domestic development goals. It would
[[also]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[diversify Greenland's import sources
and export markets]{.underline}]{.mark}, adding needed resilience to its
economy. A bilateral agreement would enhance opportunities for
Greenland's young people as well.

[[For the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates,
gains would be both geopolitical and economic. A U.S.-Greenland trade
[[agreement would deepen the bilateral political relationship with
a]{.underline}n]{.mark} important Arctic [partner]{.underline} and
[ally]{.mark} [[that hosts one of the most strategically important
overseas U.S. military bases]{.underline}]{.mark} (Thule Air Base). It
would also be a tangible manifestation of the U.S. commitment to the
Arctic - a region of growing strategic importance, according to the
White House's National Strategy for the Arctic Region. A trade agreement
would [[also expand two-way trade with]{.underline}]{.mark} a friendly
democratic neighbor within the North American hemisphere -- [[a neighbor
which happens to have abundant natural resources]{.underline}]{.mark}
including the critical minerals that are key to a greener energy future.
While Greenland's population is very small, a trade agreement with
market access would nevertheless over time confer some notable benefits
to U.S. manufacturers of consumables and vehicles. An agreement that
deepens bilateral trade ties could be particularly beneficial to Maine
and Alaska.

Ms. Naaja H. Nathanielsen (interviewee) is the Minister for Business,
Trade, Raw Materials, Justice and Gender Equality in the government of
Greenland.

Greenland is in the Western Hemisphere, closer to Washington, D.C. than
to Copenhagen. It has a small native population, is in the middle of the
Arctic shipping route, and is a country with untapped mineral and energy
resources. How do you think [the Dubai or Singapore model]{.mark} might
work for Greenland---[an extremely prosperous but small trade and
shipping hub]{.mark}, connecting the continental U.S. to the rest of
Europe and the Arctic, [with lots of ports and]{.mark} [mining]{.mark}? 

The growth this [would entail would require a large and rapid influx of
foreign workers, while risking an increase in inequality]{.mark}. This
[could lead to social instability]{.mark}. As a former colony we are
very sensitive towards this. 

[We are instead working on [diversifying our economy]{.underline} in a
manner the local population can follow]{.mark}. Our ambitions are [three
to five active mines at any given time]{.mark}, some [more
shipping]{.mark}, [expanding revenue from]{.mark} the [fishing]{.mark}
sector [and]{.mark} developing [tourism]{.mark}, while avoiding mass
tourism. This would benefit other sectors as well, such as
[construction]{.mark}, and grow our economy, while enabling the
population to develop alongside it [and make the immigration]{.mark}
steady and [manageable]{.mark}.

[But there are **[ample opportunities for American investments into
Greenland]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [We do not have a lot of]{.mark}
production. We primarily have the first part of the value chain both in
the fishing and the mineral sectors. But [tech]{.mark} has a growing
impact in these sectors and investments into this would be very
interesting. 

Also [our developing energy sector would be a great place for
American]{.mark} tech [investments]{.mark}, not to mention
[infrastructure]{.mark} [and]{.mark} possibly in [defense as
well]{.mark}.

Speaking of mining, your prime minister recently stated that [[Greenland

much American tech and investment would you like to see in Greenland,
and what would be your message to the incoming American administration?

There are ample opportunities for American investors to engage
themselves in Greenland, not only in the mining sector, but in other
sectors as well. 

Especially [[the mining sector could be beneficial to securing supply
chains to the U.S., since we do have many of the minerals on your list
of critical minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}. These could be graphite,
nickel, rare earths, or others. 

[Our]{.mark} existing [agreement with the U.S]{.mark}. State Department
[is from 2019]{.mark} under the first Trump administration. [[We
have]{.mark} for some time **[been hoping for a new
agreement.]{.mark}**]{.underline} 

[This could focus on certain minerals and projects, on data, on supply
chains, research]{.mark} and [future potentials (mapping]{.mark}). It
would [also]{.mark} be beneficial to look into [de-risking
instruments]{.mark} for the projects and investors, since it is a
high-risk and long-term investment to engage in the mineral sector.

COPENHAGEN, Jan 13 (Reuters) - [[Greenland Prime
Minister]{.underline}]{.mark} Mute Egede [[said]{.underline}]{.mark} on
Monday [[the country is]{.mark} [looking to **strengthen its**
]{.mark}defence and [**mining ties** with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, albeit on its own terms,
[[following]{.underline}]{.mark} renewed [[interest
from]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. President-elect Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, last week returned to an idea
floated during his first term of acquiring the strategically important
and mineral-rich Arctic island and described U.S. control of Greenland,
a semi-autonomous Danish territory, as an \"absolute necessity\".

Egede said his [[government was looking for ways to cooperate with the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that it was ready to [[start a dialogue with
Trump\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} incoming
[[administration]{.underline}]{.mark}, but stressed it would be up to it
to decide how it should proceed.

When asked at a press conference in Nuuk on Monday about expanding U.S.
military capabilities on the vast Arctic island, Egede said:
\"Greenland\'s independence is Greenland\'s business, also in relation
to the use of its land, so it is also Greenland that will decide what
agreement we should come to.\"

Egede has summoned the leaders of Greenland\'s political parties to a
meeting in the capital Nuuk to discuss a collective approach to the U.S.
interest.

\"This is the first time Greenland has been listened to in an intense
way. We need to be calm and take advantage of things and stand
together,\" he said.

While Trump did not rule out the potential use of military or economic
means to gain control of Greenland last week, U.S. Vice President-elect
JD Vance, speaking to Fox News on Sunday, dismissed the use of military
force even as he highlighted Greenland\'s strategic importance and its
rich resources.

\"It was worrying when we first heard it. But the vice president said
yesterday that they have no interest in using weapons. **[[Our interest
is in cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Egede said.

Greenland remains open to discussions on enhancing security
collaboration in the Arctic, especially amid growing geopolitical
tensions.

"We will always be a part of NATO. [We will always be a strong partner

### AT: Greenlanders Oppose Mines\-\--2AC

#### Residents acknowledge the economic benefits of mining and only oppose if significant environmental harms

[[At the moment, Greenland has only two active
mines]{.underline}]{.mark}---one producing rubies and the other
anorthosite, which is used in paints, plastic coatings, and special
kinds of glass. But [dozens of companies from the U.S. and other nations
have exploration projects underway]{.underline}, and five have licenses
to begin digging.

"The mining companies know what we have in Narsaq," Paviasen says. "We
are not safe in the future."

Like almost all settlements in Greenland, Narsaq can be reached only by
sea or air. Most people speak Greenlandic, an Indigenous language that
is related to Inuit languages spoken in Canada and Alaska. The main
employers are the government and a small factory that cleans and freezes
halibut, salmon, and shrimp caught by local people for export to Asia.

[[Narsaq residents were initially in favor of the nearby
mine]{.underline}]{.mark}, attracted by the promise of badly needed
jobs. [[But opinion shifted as people learned more]{.mark} about the
project]{.underline}. Tailings, [[the leftover]{.mark} [waste from ore
processing]{.mark}]{.underline}, would be deposited in a lake that lies
above the town. Narsaq residents worry that a dam wouldn't be enough to
keep radioactive water from reaching their homes. Residents, whose lives
have already been upended by climate change, [[say they don't want to
suffer even more]{.underline}]{.mark} so that the rest of the world can
drive electric cars.

On Narsaq's docks, where the men head out to hunt seals or look for
minke whales, opposition to the mine seems widespread.

"My children and grandchildren would also like to live in this town,"
says Emanuel Joelsen, one of the whale hunters. (Whale meat is still a
big part of Greenlanders' diet, and they are allowed under international
agreements to hunt a limited number of the endangered animals.)

[[Some local people support the mining project. "It's about jobs, work,
a lot of money for the local people]{.mark},"]{.underline} says Jens
Karl Petersen, a cook in Narsarsuaq, about 30 miles from Narsaq.

'It's Worth Fighting For'

[[On the opposite side]{.underline}]{.mark} of the fjord from Narsaq
[[is a mining project whose main backer has not generated the same
hostility]{.mark} as Greenland Minerals]{.underline}. Greg Barnes, a
prospector from Australia, has a license to mine the area, known as
Tanbreez. [[The site has only trace amounts of
radioactivity]{.mark},]{.underline} Barnes says, but rich deposits of
metals like tantalum, used in mobile phones, and zirconium, used in fuel
cells and various kinds of electronics.

Barnes says U.S. officials "see us as a solution" to China's dominance
of rare earths.

Mining executives say they're aware of the need to pay attention to
climate concerns. Some mining companies see a chance to establish
Greenland as a reputable source of the raw materials for emissions-free
power generation and transportation.

Greenland Minerals has kept a low profile since the 2021 elections
brought an anti-uranium government to power, but it has not given up on
mining near Narsaq. [[The company is looking for ways to address local
concerns, for example, by shipping the minerals somewhere else for
processing rather than separating out the uranium in
Narsaq]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But activists like Paviasen aren't easily soothed. She knows how
important Greenland's clean air and water are.

"This is one of the most beautiful places in Greenland," Paviasen says.
"It's worth fighting for."

The juxtaposition between new mining partly made possible due to global
warming and mining minerals for the energy transition is not lost on
many. The Arctic is warming up four-times faster than the rest of the
world and climate change is already affecting the lives and livelihoods
of Greenland's population. [Three in four residents say they have
personally experienced the effects of climate change and [around 38% say
they are]{.mark} very or [moderately afraid of climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

We are seeing longer seasons and milder winters, where we are able to do
more exploration. At the same time, weather patterns also seem to be
more dynamic and less predictable.

Bo Møller Stensgaard, CEO of Bluejay Mining

"We are seeing longer seasons and milder winters, where we are able to
do more exploration, " says Stensgaard. "At the same time, weather
patterns also seem to be more dynamic and less predictable." Having
worked in Greenland for more than 20 years, he has seen the landscape
change.

"You see the effects of climate change. Glaciers have retreated and ice
caps are melting. While it does unlock new ways of operation out here, I
wouldn't say I am happy about this. Irrespective of the situation, I
would be operating in Greenland."

[To stop the ice caps from melting further, countries must drastically
reduce greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}. Doing so depends on
electrification and the [minerals needed for technologies]{.mark} such
as batteries and electric vehicles. [[Mining can provide these
minerals,]{.mark} but at the same time, mining itself inevitably has an
impact on the environment and local communities.]{.underline}

["Greenland is a frontier area that is underexplored and can provide
resources that the future needs]{.underline}," says Stensgaard. "[We are
recognising the surrounding issues, while also [acknowledging
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the **metals extracted from Greenland could
be** ]{.mark}**part of [the solutions to climate

#### Over a fifth of the population argues that mining is essential to economic and political independence

**Gray 16** \[Bryce; March 17; energy and environmental journalist;
Arctic Deeply; "As Greenland Ramps Up Mining, Who Will Benefit?";

NUUK, Greenland --- Although Greenland bears many signs of its European
ties, its economy lags behind its Nordic counterparts[. [Unemployment
sits just below 10 percen]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark}, and
hardscrabble villages line its coasts, offering [[few job opportunities
to residents]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Much of the populace has been captivated by the economic promise of
proposed mining projects]{.underline}]{.mark} ever since Greenland
gained autonomy over its mineral resource policy from Denmark in a 2009
referendum. Meanwhile, multinational corporations have kept an
appraising eye on the region as resources ranging from iron and zinc to
uranium and rare earth elements become accessible.

In recent years, the imminent expansion of mining and drilling in
Greenland has been a divisive, hot-button issue in elections held
throughout the self-governing Danish territory. Although prices for
various minerals have slumped lately, the debate continues to simmer as
numerous Greenland mining projects continue to move forward,
representing new hope for an economy that largely relies on support from
the Danish government and precarious fisheries.

The extent to which Greenland welcomes or resists foreign mining
interests could have tremendous implications, not only on its natural
environment and small, coastal communities, but also on its aspirations
of independence.

"There's a huge discussion about how to not depend on \[payment from
Denmark\] and income from fish," said Julie Rademacher, a former member
of Danish parliament and currently [[an adviser]{.mark} with a
Greenlandic labor union [that represents 10,000 workers, equivalent
to]{.mark} nearly [20 percent of the population]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Rademacher [[upholds that mining is an essential step toward fiscal and
political independence.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Protestors urge the Greenland government to open mining operations to provide much needed job opportunities

**Fletcher 14** \[James; January 1; BBC World Service Journalist; BBC
News; "Mining in Greenland - a country divided";
https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25421967\] 

Rare earth elements are used in everything from mobile phones to solar
panels to wind turbines. [China dominates world supply]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} if people like Greg Barnes are right, [[Greenland has the
potential]{.mark} [to be a major player]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It\'s not just rare-earth minerals - Greenland also has reserves of
gold, iron-ore, rubies and uranium, as well as oil and gas. In this
country of just 57,000 people, with a GDP of \$2.4bn (£1.5bn),
[[developing those resources could have a big economic
impact]{.underline}.]{.mark}

And it could bring full independence from former colonial master
Denmark, which still provides a substantial annual subsidy for
Greenland\'s budget.

\"It gives you some thought that you\'ve been walking on billions of
dollars all your life and not knowing about it,\" Kierkegaard says.
\"It\'s a significant time in Greenland.\"

In the nearby town of Narsaq, money like that could make a huge
difference.

Nestled at the foot of a mountain where two fjords meet, it\'s a
picturesque town of brightly coloured houses like Lego bricks sprinkled
amongst the snow.

Like much of Greenland, it has traditionally made its living from
fishing and hunting, and also more recently farming for lamb. But at the
town slaughterhouse, manager Henning Sonderup tells me that traditional
way of life no longer pays the bills.

\"[[Many people are unemployed]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he says. \"Lots
of families from Narsaq have moved out to other cities, so we have to do
something.\"

Several years ago the shrimp processing plant in Narsaq closed, and with
it around 80 jobs. It\'s been partly offset by the expansion of a
catering school and the construction of a new slaughterhouse, but
[[Narsaq\'s population has fallen by around 10% over the past five
years]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Sonderup feels that [[unemployment and a lack of opportunities leads to
social problems]{.underline}]{.mark} - \"people drinking beer, some
going around just like zombies with nothing to do\".

Susanne Lynge is another who thinks the town is in a downward spiral.

She\'s leading a loud protest in the snow outside the town council
offices, shouting slogans into a megaphone while dozens of school
children cheer in response. They wave colourful signs calling for the
council to speed up construction of a new school.

\"[[Our local government needs money]{.mark},]{.underline}\" she says[.
[\"**I wish they would open the mining**]{.underline}.\"]{.mark}

Henning Sonderup reels off [[a list of the improvements that mining
could bring: \"New school, bigger]{.mark} [hospital, better airport, new
harbour, new roads, everything]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he says.
[\"[Greenland will be on the map again]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

#### The plan guts Greenland nationalism, ruins the tourism industry, results in a loss of biodiversity, and leads to diseases

**Fletcher 14** \[James; January 1; BBC World Service Journalist; BBC
News; "Mining in Greenland - a country divided";
https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25421967\] 

The mine\'s prospects received a major boost in October [[when
Greenland\'s parliament voted]{.mark} by 15 votes to 14 [to
overturn]{.mark} a long-standing [ban on uranium
mining]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are more legal hurdles to be overcome
before uranium mining is a reality in Greenland, but the vote
[[triggered]{.mark} huge debate in Greenland and [much concern]{.mark}
in Narsaq.]{.underline}

Avaaraq Olsen is [a]{.mark} teacher and [member of the local
council]{.mark} for the opposition Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Sitting in
her kitchen, she remembers the day the ban was overturned.

\"I was very sad, [[I was crying,\" she says]{.underline}. \"[I\'m
**ashamed of being a Greenlander**]{.underline}. [If this mine is
starting]{.underline}]{.mark} here in Narsaq, [[we will be moving
away]{.mark},]{.underline} not just from Narsaq, but [[from
Greenland]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

At Olsen\'s house, there are guns by the door where you or I might keep
umbrellas, ready to be slung over the shoulder whenever the weather is
right for hunting birds or seals.

\"My biggest concern is [[it will cause so much pollution that we won\'t
be able to live in our town - and **all the animals and biodiversity
will be destroyed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, \" she says.

These environmental concerns are shared by other hunters and fishermen,
and many of the 50 or so sheep farms in the surrounding area.

French-born Agathe Devisme runs Ipiutaq Farm with her Greenlandic
partner Kallista Poulsen. As well as farming 300 sheep, they also rent
out a cottage on the farm to tourists during the summer.

\"[[People coming to Greenland are looking for something
pure]{.underline}]{.mark},\" she says. \"It\'s the last corner of the
world not touched by pollution[[. If there is any kind of radioactivity
in the area, they will not like it]{.underline}.\"]{.mark}

[[The mines would also involve an influx of foreign workers into
Narsaq]{.underline}]{.mark}, as there simply aren\'t enough skilled
workers in Greenland to fill all the jobs the mines will create. Some
see this as a benefit - the miners will live in the community, send
their kids to the school, and spend their money at local businesses.

But other aren\'t so sure.

\"[[I don\'t think it\'s healthy for such a small town to have so many
people from outside]{.underline}]{.mark},\" says Ivalo Lund, head nurse
at Narsaq\'s Hospital. \"It will be young men looking at the beautiful
young girls here.\"

[She\'s worried about [sexually-transmitted diseases and unwanted
pregnancies]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}to fathers who leave town, and
like Olsen says she\'ll move away if the Kvanefjeld mine goes ahead.

\"[I will be sad to see [this town be destroyed]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
she tells me. \"**[[It will be a mining town and we will never ever be
able to live as we do now]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

#### Trump won't accept more foreign reliance. He [says no to the CP]{.underline}.

Aime **Williams 25**, US Trade and Climate Correspondent for the
Financial Times; and Demetri **Sevastopulo**, US-China Correspondent for
the Financial Times, 4/16/2025, \"Donald Trump threatens to hit critical
minerals with tariffs,\"
https://www.ft.com/content/7ac046c1-0a6a-40db-970c-579070c7a55a

Donald [Trump]{.underline} has [threatened to apply **tariffs** on
**critical minerals**]{.underline} in a move that could increase
tensions with China and open a new front in a global trade war that has
rattled markets.

In an executive order on Tuesday, the [US president ordered]{.underline}
the [commerce department to study]{.underline} the [critical mineral
supply chains and come up with ways to boost **American** production
while **cutting reliance on imports**]{.underline}.

The investigation [could lead to **new tariffs**]{.underline} being
imposed. Trump's announcement comes just over two weeks after his
"liberation day" tariffs sparked days of market turmoil and warnings
that the deepening stand-off with China could tip the global economy
into recession.

"President Trump recognizes that an overreliance on foreign critical
minerals and their derivative products could jeopardize US defense
capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,"
the order read. 

The investigation threatens to trigger a new critical minerals trade war
as the US tries to wrestle back control of a crucial industry that is
dominated by China. It comes after China suspended exports of several
heavy rare earth metals and rare earth magnets used in the defence,
robotics and energy industries to buyers around the world.

The Trump administration is following on from initiatives started during
the Biden administration to reduce American reliance on adversaries for
minerals and metals that are used in everything from electric car
batteries to jet engines to missiles.

Although the White House emphasised the importance of minerals and rare
earths for military applications, any shortage could affect companies in
sectors from energy to auto manufacturing.

The Financial Times reported this week that the White House was drafting
an executive order to enable the stockpiling of metal found on the
Pacific Ocean seabed, as part of the broader effort to counter China's
dominance of rare earth supply chains.

The [probe would be carried out under Section 232 of]{.underline} the
[Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which Trump has used to launch
investigations into **chips**, **copper**]{.underline} and lumber. He
has also used the law to apply tariffs to autos, steel and aluminium.  

The executive order said any resulting tariffs would replace any
"reciprocal" tariff rates placed on these critical minerals, which could
in theory lead to tariffs on those minerals being lowered instead of
raised. 

The [White House]{.underline} said [the US remained "**heavily dependent
on foreign sources**, particularly adversarial nations, for
these]{.underline} essential [materials]{.underline}", arguing that it
exposed the country to "economic coercion".

Mining: Rocky Industry Challenges and Opportunities,\"
https://mcmillan.ca/insights/ontario-mining-rocky-industry-challenges-and-opportunities/

Canadian mining is the leading global producer of potash. It is also
ranked internationally among the top five producers of aluminum, cobalt,
diamonds, gold, and platinum.\[1\] While the global community relies on
these raw materials in their daily lives and for advanced technologies;
[Canadian mining is **struggling**]{.underline} and is at a critical
juncture, [facing]{.underline} a mix of [challenges
hindering]{.underline} growth and [international competitiveness.
**Lengthy permitting**]{.underline} processes, [stagnant public markets,
diminished institutional investment, **regulatory barriers** to
obtaining foreign investment and a **talent shortage**]{.underline},
especially in the "next generation" hinder progress. In this bulletin,
we examine these pressing challenges, explore implications for Canadian
mining, with a focus on Ontario, and steps to be taken to address them.

Lengthy Permitting Processes

"It [shouldn't take **15 years** to open]{.underline} a
[mine]{.underline}." says George Pirie, Ontario's Minister of Mines.
"This [process is too **time consuming** and **costly**, leading to
**project delays**, and lost opportunities for Ontario's]{.underline}
mineral exploration and [mining sector]{.underline}".\[2\] The
permitting process for [mining projects in Canada has become
increasingly lengthy and complex. Bureaucratic red tape, jurisdictional
overlap between federal and provincial governments, and stringent
environmental requirements contribute]{.underline} significantly [to
delays]{.underline}.

Increased time to obtain a permit is part of a broader international
trend. S&P Global examined average times for mines coming online
internationally and found it took an average of 17.9 years for mines
coming online in 2020--23; compared to only 12.7 years for some mines
that started operations before 2009. In Canada, the average timeline for
mines to start operations was around 18 years, aligning with global
trends.\[3\] These delays hamper initiation of new mining projects and
deter potential investors, affecting the sector's growth and economic
prospects. Shortening timeframes to permit mines allows projects to
launch faster thereby having a more immediate positive impact on the
Canadian economy, decreasing timelines for investor returns and
bolstering investor confidence for current and future projects.

Efforts are underway to streamline processes with various levels of
Canadian government implementing reforms. In March 2023, Mr. Pirie
introduced amendments to Ontario's Mining Act to address some of these
issues, through Bill 71, the Building More Mines Act, 2023, which aims
to reduce administrative burdens and clarify rehabilitation
requirements. The changes aim to decrease timelines for commencing or
altering production and advanced exploration projects, assisting
permitting for mineral recovery from waste and tailings materials and
make mining closure plans more simplistic. The Building More Mines Act
received royal assent in May 2023.

In April 2024, Ontario Regulation 240/00 was replaced by Ontario
Regulation 35/24. This new regulation aims to more align with the
Building More Mines Act, 2023 and, amongst other things, clarifies
criteria for qualified person certification, introduces conditional
filing orders to streamline closure plan approvals, formalizing phased
financial assurance to align rehabilitation funding with project
milestones and prescribes requirements for determining acceptable
post-closure use of mine sites other than the prior use or
condition.\[4\] Ontario has also committed, through its latest round of
funding, \$13 million to 84 projects through the Ontario Junior
Exploration Program\[5\] to support early-stage mineral exploration,
particularly in underexplored regions. By reducing financial barriers,
this initiative aims to accelerate new discoveries and attract further
investment, helping to address long timelines and high costs of
launching projects.

Stagnant Canadian Public Markets

In recent years, the [number of new listings on Canadian public
markets]{.underline}, including those in the mining industry **[sharply
declined]{.underline}**. In 2024, there were only 25 IPOs (including
capital pool and special purpose acquisition companies) completed across
the Canadian Securities Exchange (the "CSE"), the TSX Venture Exchange
(the "TSXV"), the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") and the Cboe Canada
(formerly NEO Exchange).\[6\] [Economic pressures including **high
inflation**, **interest rates** and recently potential implementation of
United States **tariffs**]{.underline} have [strained Canadian **stock
exchanges**, reducing IPOs and]{.underline} subsequent [trading
activity]{.underline}. Influenced by multiple global factors, growth
companies, including junior [mining exploration companies are opting for
continued growth in]{.underline} the [private markets or
shifting]{.underline} their [going public plans to markets outside of
Canada]{.underline}.

A [decline in]{.underline} Canadian [public markets]{.underline}
activity [poses **significant challenges** for mining companies as
public markets offer unique advantages difficult to replicate as a
private company]{.underline}. Approximately 40% of the world's public
mining companies are listed on the TSX and the TSXV, underscoring the
importance of Canadian public listings in the mining sector. Publicly
listed companies have greater access to external capital, increased
liquidity for shareholders and are better positioned for mergers and
acquisitions, as their market valuation and financial transparency make
them appealing to potential buyers or strategic partners. In addition,
being public enhances a company's visibility and credibility, making it
more attractive to potential investors, partners, and stakeholders.

Additionally in recent years, [Canadian **investor interest** shifted
from]{.underline} traditional [high-risk sectors like mining
to]{.underline} emerging industries including [cryptocurrencies,
early-stage technology startups, and cannabis]{.underline}. This
transition is partly due to the allure of rapid growth and innovation in
these new markets however market interest can shift rapidly and
companies in mineral exploration and development benefit from the
flexibility when publicly listed of accessing markets rapidly when
investor interest shifts to the sector.

While wider economic factors continue to depress Canadian public markets
activity, separate strategic measures could enhance attractiveness of
Canadian public listings and address existing challenges including:

#### There's no institutional investment.

Mining: Rocky Industry Challenges and Opportunities,\"
https://mcmillan.ca/insights/ontario-mining-rocky-industry-challenges-and-opportunities/

Lack of Institutional Investment into Mining and Canada

[**Institutional** investment]{.underline} generally [in Canada was
significantly reduced in recent years]{.underline}, particularly
domestic investment from large pension funds. These funds, managing
trillions in assets, have increasingly turned away from domestic
investments, [seeking]{.underline} larger-scale [opportunities
abroad]{.underline}, marking a material decrease in Canadian pension
fund domestic investment since the 90's. This trend is driven largely by
the sheer size of these funds, which often find Canadian companies,
especially mining, too small to meet their growing investment needs.

[This]{.underline} trend specifically [impacts **mining**. Mining
companies]{.underline}, particularly [at]{.underline} the **[junior
stage]{.underline}** are smaller [compared to **global
enterprises**]{.underline} in other sectors, [find it **challenging** to
attract substantial investments from pension giants]{.underline}
shifting investment focus to larger international projects. Further, the
long-term, capital-intensive nature of mining projects [may not align
with]{.underline} the [risk profiles and return expectations these
pension funds demand]{.underline}​.

#### No workforce

Generational Transitional Instability and a Talent Shortage

Ontario's [mining industry]{.underline} supports 31,000 direct mining
jobs and another 47,000 indirect jobs​;\[13\] however, the sector [faces
a **significant challenge** as]{.underline} the [aging workforce
approaches retirement with insufficient young workers entering
mining]{.underline} to fill the gap. The average age of a mining worker
is now over 46, with nearly half of the skilled engineering workforce
set to retire within the next decade.\[14\] As noted by Frank Galati,
Managing Partner at The Bedford Group "[The **gray tsunami is
coming**]{.underline}: Around half of the industry will retire in the
coming years, leaving a huge gap that needs to be filled."\[15\] This is
an issue from the top of corporate organizations in the c-suite down to
boots on the ground workers. In a sector struggling to attract new
talent, this looming retirement wave threatens to leave a critical
knowledge gap.

A key issue exacerbating this problem is a perceived [**lack of
interest** among young people in pursuing **mining-related
education**]{.underline}. This has created a "lost decade" of training
new professionals, leading to [a shortage of qualified candidates when
demand for minerals is surging]{.underline}. Additionally, today's
younger workforce seeks careers that align with values such as
sustainability which although the mining industry is committed to
sustainability, it has not always been able to effectively communicate
this commitment to broad audience.

#### China involvement in Canada means the CP [doesn't solve]{.underline}.

Alfie **Shaw 24**, journalist at Mining Technology, 3/15/2024, \"China
to continue Canadian mining investments despite scrutiny,\"
https://www.mining-technology.com/news/china-will-continue-to-invest-in-canadas-critical-mineral-industry-despite-pushback/

[China's ambassador to Canada]{.underline}, Cong Peiwu, has
[said]{.underline} that [his country will **continue to do business** in
Canada's critical minerals sector]{.underline} despite increased
scrutiny placed on Chinese investments.

Last week, the Canadian Government signalled its concern about Chinese
control of its critical mineral supplies. Ottawa will now consider how
to handle offtake agreements that function as loans or investments by
China in Canadian mining companies.

Reacting to the measures, Cong said the Trudeau administration is
"wrong" to prevent Chinese investors from buying majority stakes in
domestic mining companies. Speaking to Bloomberg, Cong said:
"Politicising normal commercial cooperation and using national security
as a pretext for political interference is wrong. China has expressed
firm opposition to this. We will continue to do business on the basis of
mutual respect and mutual benefit."

The move comes on the back of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announcing
his intention to limit Chinese investment more than a year ago. Prior to
this, in 2022, his administration forced Chinese investors to withdraw
from three lithium companies under the critical mineral divestment
strategy.

Nevertheless, [**several Chinese holdings** have been acquired this
year]{.underline}. Zijin Mining Group set in motion plans to buy a 15%
stake in Canadian copper miner Solaris Resources; Ganfeng Lithium aimed
to acquire a 15% stake in Lithium Americas Argentina; and Yintai Gold
bought gold explorer Osino Resources for C\$368m (\$271m).

[As domestic funding drained due to low commodity prices, Canada's
junior mining companies have been lured with favourable terms offered by
Chinese investors]{.underline}.

Critical minerals such as lithium, copper, nickel and cobalt have
important applications in the production of electric vehicles, solar
panels and wind turbines. China currently holds a dominant position in
the supply chains of these minerals.

Speaking at the Resourcing Tomorrow Mining conference in London last
year, Michal Meidan, director at the Oxford Institute for Energy
Studies, said that China has "80--100% control of some processing supply
chains" of critical minerals.

#### Too many barriers to Canadian mineral development. 

Ariane **Bourassa 24**, Head of Sustainability and ESG Strategy at TMX
Group Limited, 3/10/2024, \"What is holding back investment in Canadian
critical minerals?\"
https://climateinstitute.ca/what-holding-back-canada-critical-minerals/

As the global energy transition accelerates, demand for critical
minerals is growing rapidly. The race to secure access to critical
minerals such as copper, nickel, and lithium is shaping the industrial
competitive landscape, and governments around the world are forming
alliances and crafting policies to secure their supplies of critical
minerals. [By]{.underline} one [recent estimate, Canada must
increase]{.underline} its [investment in]{.underline} new [critical
mineral mining by **\$30 billion**]{.underline} by 2040 [to
become]{.underline} a [major]{.underline} player in this growing
sector.\[1\]

[But]{.underline} as a recent survey of market participants makes clear,
[**significant barriers** stand in the way]{.underline}.

The Canadian Climate Institute, a leading climate change policy research
organization, is undertaking new research to explore investment barriers
across the critical minerals value chain, and the role of government
policy in addressing these barriers. In collaboration with TMX Group,
operator of global markets, including Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX
Venture Exchange, the Institute surveyed 174 representatives from a wide
range or organizations across the critical minerals eco-system to
understand what's standing in the way of Canada building high-quality,
responsible critical mineral mining projects (see box below for more
details on the survey methodology).

Box 1: Canadian Climate Institute's Survey Methodology

The survey was designed to uncover what the investment barriers are, how
these barriers vary across the value chain, and the tensions between
advancing investment while meeting social and environmental objectives.
To have a good understanding of the different barriers, the survey
targeted a wide range of organizations in the critical minerals
ecosystem, including exploration and mining companies, institutional
investors, industry associations, government departments, environmental
organizations, and academic researchers. In total, the survey had 174 ,
68 per cent C-suite or senior management, from companies that work
directly in the critical minerals value chain, representing projects
that cover every province and territory across Canada. It is worth
noting that the survey sample is not representative of the full range of
perspectives around critical mineral projects. In particular, it
includes limited responses from Indigenous rights holders and
organizations.

Below is a preliminary overview of key insights from the survey. In
early 2025, the Canadian Climate Institute will publish a comprehensive
report with detailed analysis and policy recommendations to address the
financing gap, as well as the social and environmental hurdles the
growing sector must overcome.

The current level of investment in Canada's critical minerals value
chain is insufficient

This was the question on which respondents were most aligned---[87 per
cent agreed]{.underline} that the current [level of investments is
"insufficient" or "very insufficient" to grow Canada's critical minerals
value chain]{.underline}. That number was even higher among respondents
in the financial sector, with all respondents rating current investment
levels as "insufficient" or "very insufficient."

Do you think the level of investment today is sufficient or insufficient
to grow Canada's critical mineral value chain?

The [financing gap is **most significant** in upstream exploration and
extraction]{.underline}

The majority of respondents (63 per cent) rated the upstream exploration
and extraction segments of the value chain to have the most significant
financing gap. A similar proportion (65 per cent) responded that
government policy has the potential to make the biggest impact on
upstream mining extraction. Only three per cent of respondents viewed
the financing gap in downstream manufacturing (e.g., battery cells;
electric vehicles) as the most significant.

[**Permitting delays**, lack of **infrastructure**, and lack of
**clarity** around Indigenous rights and title rank as **top
project-level barriers**]{.underline}

The survey asked respondents to rate potential barriers to increasing
investment at the project level, on a scale from "very minor" to "very
major." [Delays in **permitting and regulatory review** processes topped
the list]{.underline}, with 79 per cent of respondents rating it a "very
major" or "major" barrier.

The [lack of infrastructure, such as roads and access to power, for
remote projects was]{.underline} the [second highest-rated
barrier]{.underline}, with 66 per cent rating it "very major" or
"major," followed by barriers related to lack of clarity around
Indigenous rights and title (52 per cent).

High capital costs and long payback periods are the most significant
capital market barriers

[When asked to identify the single biggest capital market barrier that
discourages]{.underline} and constrains [investment in]{.underline} the
[critical mineral value chain within Canada]{.underline}, nearly
[one-third]{.underline} of respondents (31 per cent) [identified high
capital costs]{.underline} and long payback periods.

Respondents also noted that [cost overruns often undermine]{.underline}
the [ability for projects to **attract and secure
investment**]{.underline}, and this is further exacerbated by price
volatility and uncompetitive market behaviour from other international
market participants.

Please select the single most significant capital market barrier that,
in your view, currently discourages and constrains investments in
critical mineral chain projects within Canada.

Social and environmental objectives can be achieved while maintaining a
globally competitive value chain

The survey asked respondents to rate the importance to investors of
various social and environmental objectives -- including maximizing
economic and social benefits to local communities, advancing Indigenous
self-determination and economic empowerment, and reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. Respondents were also asked whether those objectives could be
achieved while maintaining a globally competitive critical minerals
value chain.

A majority of respondents (83 per cent) agreed that mitigating negative
impacts to the local environment and communities is important, and 91
per cent agreed that Canada can achieve these objectives while remaining
competitive.

[Canada's critical mineral value chain is **complex**, as
are]{.underline} the [**barriers** holding back its growth]{.underline}

These [survey insights highlight]{.underline} the [**complexity of
Canada's critical mineral value chain** and]{.underline} the [barriers
holding back its growth as global demand -- and competition --
grow]{.underline}.

### AT: Mine Alaska CP\-\--2AC

#### Alaskan projects empirically fail.

Gershon **Cohen 25**, project director of Alaska Clean Water Advocacy,
et al., 6/17/2025, \"Opinion: The Palmer project is a bad bet for
Alaska's mining industry,\"
https://www.adn.com/opinions/2025/06/17/opinion-the-palmer-project-is-a-bad-bet-for-alaskas-mining-industry/

Vancouver-based American Pacific Mining (APM) wants investors to believe
the Palmer Copper-Zinc Project near Haines has a high potential for
profit. If so, why did the giant Japanese minerals company DOWA walk
away last November from a ten-year investment of tens of millions of
dollars? [Why does **APM**]{.underline} suddenly [want to sell the
prospect and **leave Alaska**]{.underline}?

Here are five reasons [the economic uncertainties, ecological risks and
social negatives far outweigh]{.underline} the [project's]{.underline}
highly speculative potential [profits]{.underline}:

[1. Access, climate and geography challenges]{.underline}

The proposed mine site is partially covered by the Saksaia Glacier, and
[experiences very **high annual precipitation**]{.underline} rates (rain
and snow), [landslides, avalanches and earthquakes]{.underline}. The
site [will be **challenging to develop** and nearly impossible to
control]{.underline}.

APM claims the site is adjacent to the paved Haines Highway. Technically
true, but highly misleading unless you can fly like a Chilkat bald eagle
across the wide, braided Klehini River. The old logging road that
connects the proposed site to the highway runs parallel to the Klehini
for seven miles and often washes away in the spring when the winter snow
melts. The gravel road runs another seven miles alongside Glacier Creek,
and can quickly become impassable from avalanches and mudslides.

APM touts the site's proximity (37 miles) to the deep-water port in
Haines, stretching the truth even further. The Lutak Dock facility lacks
ore transfer capability and has been collapsing into Lutak Inlet for
decades. Most of the dock is closed to the public due to safety
concerns.

[2. A profitable mineral resource has **yet to be
demonstrated**]{.underline}

[Independent geologists describe]{.underline} the [ore body as folded,
faulted, discontinuous and with varying]{.underline} ore [thickness and
grade, making it difficult to assess and]{.underline} ultimately to
[mine profitably]{.underline}. APM's 2019 Preliminary Economic
Assessment predictions relied on operating costs far less than other
operating mines in the region, and the dubious profitability of
marketing barite.

Further definition of the ore body's geometry and grade will require
blasting a mile-plus-long exploration tunnel beneath the Saksaia
Glacier. Hundreds of thousands of gallons of wastewater contaminated
with silt, hydrocarbons, explosives residues, and heavy metals (once the
ore body is reached) will be draining from the tunnel every day and
require treatment in perpetuity before reaching the nearby Klehini
River.

3\. The Palmer Project [lacks social license]{.underline}

The Haines economy is based largely on the abundance of fish, eagles and
bears living in the Chilkat Valley. Aside from the pollution risks, the
long-term socio-economic impacts of siting large resource extraction
projects near small rural communities are well known: social disruption
from the introduction of hundreds of transient workers into an isolated
area and forcing a conversion to a boom-bust mining economy.

[Many residents]{.underline} of Haines and Klukwan **[strongly
oppose]{.underline}** the [project because it threatens the region's
salmon runs that are a critical source of local food and have been a
fundamental component of]{.underline} the local [culture for
millennia]{.underline}. The American Bald Eagle Foundation and National
Eagle Center are on record in opposition to the mine's development.

Despite claims to the contrary, APM and its previous joint-venture
partner DOWA have never seriously engaged with the public to discuss
whether the project should happen under any circumstances.

4\. A world-class ecosystem is worth far more than an unproven
base-metals (copper/zinc) deposit

The Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve is home to the largest
congregation of eagles on Earth.

Thousands of people come every year from all over the world to the
"council grounds" to watch eagles fish along the Chilkat River, which
hosts all five species of wild salmon, Southeast Alaska's second largest
coho run, and one of Southeast's largest sockeye runs. American Rivers
named the Chilkat/Klehini system as one of the most endangered river
systems in America because of the threats posed by the Palmer Project.

5\. APM's own words and actions tell the real story

APM appeared overjoyed at gaining 100% control of the Palmer Project in
late 2024 when DOWA walked away from the joint venture. But without
DOWA, APM hasn't had enough funding to keep the project going. In an
April 2025 video interview (Doug Casey's Experts Roundtable) APM CEO
Warwick Smith stated they are now looking to "transact" (i.e., sell) the
project, because it is "outside of our wheelhouse", there are "better
groups that are more well-suited towards Alaska than we are", and Palmer
should end up with "an Alaska-based company." After so many years of
controversy, conflict and hype, if APM still believes the Palmer Project
could be highly profitable, why sell out now?

Mining is always a gamble, but putting money down on the Palmer Project
is a sucker's bet.

#### Costs [impede]{.underline} development.

**ADN 12** -- Alaska Dispatch News, 7/27/2012, \"Cost of operating in
remote Alaska threatens mine,\"
https://www.rcinet.ca/eye-on-the-arctic/2012/07/27/cost-of-operating-in-remote-alaska-threatens-mine/

The [**high costs** of operating in]{.underline} remote [areas
killed]{.underline} a [lot of **mines**]{.underline} in Alaska after
World War II, and the [problems]{.underline} of old seem to [**linger**
today]{.underline}.

Barrick Gold, the world's largest gold mining company, warned Thursday
the long-envisioned Donlin Creek gold prospect east of Bethel in Western
Alaska [doesn't]{.underline} "currently [meet]{.underline} our
**[investment criteria]{.underline}**."

Barrick cited potential [capital investment costs]{.underline} of [\$6.7
billion to develop]{.underline} the [mine]{.underline} as a **[major
hurdle]{.underline}**.

The gold deposits at Donlin are valued at \$20 to \$30 billion, but
Barrick said that given the variables involved it isn't comfortable with
the present rate of return.

A [big problem is getting **power** to]{.underline} the **[isolated mine
site]{.underline}**.

Barrick's announcement that it was backing away from Donlin and a
project in South America reportedly sent the stock of Donlin partner
company NovaGold to the lowest level in three years. NovaGold quickly
issued a public statement saying it was at least four years away from a
final decision on Donlin, and stressing the value of the gold still in
the ground.

Few doubt there is a lot of gold there in the Kilbuk-Kuskokwim
Mountains, but getting it to market will be pricey. Donlin is about 12
miles up a remote valley from a 100-person speck of a village named
Crooked Creek, which is itself about 120 miles upstream from Bethel, a
community of less than 20,000 people considered an Alaska regional hub.

Development challenges

Crooked Creek has [**no infrastructure** to support
**development**]{.underline}. Bethel has little. Both communities are
hundreds of air miles from Anchorage, the state's largest city, and
there are no roads --- only wilderness. All of these things drive up the
cost of development.

Donlin will [require **major construction** in the form of docks, roads
and most importantly a **power plant**]{.underline}. The companies
involved at Donlin once considered barging diesel fuel up the Kuskokwim
River, but largely rejected that idea as way too costly. Of late, they
have been studying a natural gas pipeline from Cook Inlet through the
Alaska Range to the Interior. The costs of that line was pegged at \$1
billion, and the hurdles to development potentially significant. The
route could require modifications to the historic Iditarod Trail, which
some consider a national treasure. Donlin is one of four principal
partners supporting the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. In November of
2010, apparently wary of potential public relations pitfalls, Donlin
signed a two-year deal, agreeing to donate \$285,000 a year to join
Anchorage Chrysler Dodge, GCI and Exxon Mobil among the upper crust of
race sponsors.

## EU CP

### EU Fails\-\--2AC

#### EU fails\-\--large-scale mining is [not a European business]{.underline}.

Manuel **Rico 23**, Spain Correspondent for Investigate Europe,
10/26/2023, \"Mining for minerals is not a European business,\"
https://www.investigate-europe.eu/posts/mining-minerals-not-european-business

Gathered in the Berlaymont hotel in late January, a short walk from the
EU offices and Belgium's national car and military history museums,
executives from Europe's leading banks were called to action. "I want
you to invest," European Commissioner Thierry Breton told the
financiers, "in operations in the critical raw materials value chain."

Two months later, the [European Commission presented]{.underline} its
draft [Critical Raw Materials Act]{.underline}. The CRMA, which could be
among the fastest EU laws ever adopted by early 2024, [wants to
guarantee Europe's supply of]{.underline} nickel, lithium, magnesium and
other [materials essential for]{.underline} the [green transition and
strategic industries]{.underline}. They are vital for electric cars and
renewable energy, military equipment and aerospace systems, as well as
laptops and mobile phones.

The Commission wants new mines to open across Europe, reducing the
bloc's dependency on China, [but **there is a problem**]{.underline}.
One which Thierry Breton's hotel gathering reflected: [the Commission
has **no**]{.underline} specific [**fund** to finance]{.underline} its
**[CRMA ambitions]{.underline}**.

Instead, they want to make it easier for companies to raise money by
designating certain mining projects as strategic. [The Commission is
aware]{.underline} that ["private investment alone is **not
sufficient**"]{.underline} and projects may also require public funds.
Germany plans to commit between €500 million and €1 billion to support
the mining of critical raw materials. In May, the French
government announced it would contribute €500 million to a dedicated
investment pot, to be run by a private equity fund.

But [**not all countries** are]{.underline} so [well-off]{.underline}.

"[We are]{.underline} obviously [**concerned** about]{.underline} the
[different **budgetary capacities** of]{.underline} different
[countries]{.underline}," says Portugal's energy minister Ana Fontoura.
"[We advocate a]{.underline} strong [framework for state
aid]{.underline}, because the European Union must incentivise European
industry, [but at the same time not create **internal
imbalances**]{.underline}."

[Which projects are]{.underline} deemed ["strategic" and]{.underline}
thus can [access priority EU funds is]{.underline} still being
[**debated**, with]{.underline} the **[industry lobbying
hard]{.underline}** for a broad definition. "[It is **not**]{.underline}
necessarily [the task of the EU to **finance mining**]{.underline},"
German Green MEP Henrike Hahn says. "[Companies ask banks for credit,
but banks **aren't strongly interested** in investing in that
sector]{.underline}. So, some companies need the certifications as
strategic projects."

The concerns come from complex context. The [war in Ukraine]{.underline}
has [demanded]{.underline} an **[enormous financial effort from the
EU]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the
United States has approved a massive aid plan, the Inflation Reduction
Act (IRA), which foresees an investment of \$369 billion, part of which
will go to climate and energy investments.

"The IRA is stealing all of the investments," says Rolf Kuby,
director-general at industry body Euromines. "[Our pledge to have a raw
materials fund at European level was **never positively received**. We
are in the phase where **everybody is shouting for
money**]{.underline}."

Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen tried to counter the US IRA
with a massive European subsidies plan. The idea of the European
Sovereignty Fund was to resort to the financial markets with soft loans
but many northern countries rejected the idea of a common green
transition financing plan.

How much public money is needed? Euromines does not know. "It is
impossible to give a figure," says Kuby, adding that funding "needs to
be high enough to be comparable, at least with IRA, and to answer to the
Chinese investment and subsidies, because this is an elephant in the
room". 

What Kuby does know is where the public money should go: to exploration.
"[If we want new mines to open tomorrow, we need to have a **clear focus
on exploration**. And that is]{.underline} a **[highly
risky]{.underline}** business. That is a business that is not
necessarily done by the majors, there are more small geological
exploration companies. And it is an asset if Europe finds a way to help
those exploring companies."

[Within]{.underline} the [**mining industry**, a distinction can be
made between the majors, mid-tiers and juniors. The majors are
transnational]{.underline} companies [that profit]{.underline} from the
[exploitation of the mines]{.underline}, while juniors are smaller and
often focus on high-risk exploration projects.

[Despite **consuming**]{.underline} between [25 and 30 per cent
of]{.underline} the [world's metals, **spending on mineral exploration**
in Europe is around **3 per cent**]{.underline}, according to the EU. 
This could change if the CRMA translates from written rhetoric into
action on the ground. For officials, the law is not only about reducing
Europe's dependency on China and elsewhere, but is an attempt to go
green, free from fossil fuels.

The European Commission reckons that, compared to 2020, Europe will need
access to 18 times more lithium by 2030 and 60 times more by 2050, to
meet projected demand for energy storage and electric vehicles, which
predominantly use lithium-powered batteries. 

[In]{.underline} July [2019]{.underline}, an industry
publication analysed [the seven]{.underline} major lithium [mining
projects that existed in Europe at the time]{.underline}. [Only
**one**]{.underline} of them [was]{.underline} being managed [by a
**major**]{.underline}, the Anglo-Australian company Rio Tinto, in
Serbia. The other six belonged to small companies. In January 2022, the
Serbian government revoked Rio Tinto's licences to mine lithium after
months of widespread protest.

And while the other six projects are still active, none of the mines
have opened. However, every so often, the promoters announce a new
development. These are Barroso, in Portugal, managed by Savannah
Resources; Wolfsberg, in Austria, owned by European Lithium; Cinovec, in
the Czech Republic, in the hands of European Metals; San José, in Spain,
that belongs to Infinity Lithium; Zinnwald, in Germany, then controlled
by Bacanora Lithium; and Keliber, in Finland, managed by Keliber Oy. The
latter is the most advanced and has already been bought by one of the
majors, the South African multinational Sibanye-Stillwater. 

Elsewhere, Vulcan Energy Resources launched a pilot project in 2021 in
Germany's Rhine Valley to produce "zero-carbon" green lithium. This
year, the chemical giant Nobian acquired a 50 per cent stake in the
project. France's Imerys, meanwhile, plans to start mining a lithium
deposit in the Massif Central in 2028.

[Companies exploring for new deposits are]{.underline} generally [not
financed on stock exchanges in the EU]{.underline}, but in Canada and
Australia. The growing interest in raw materials linked to the
ecological transition is having an impact on these markets. Last month,
the Toronto Stock Exchange released its annual ranking of the 30
best-performing stocks over the last three years. Seven were mining
companies (all non-European) with an average price increase of 615 per
cent.

Investigate Europe analysed the world's 200 largest mining companies by
market capitalisation, using data from the end of last July. Notably,
only 15 are European, and only six are based in the EU. Companies from
Canada (38 per cent), the US (37 per cent) and Australia (33 per cent)
dominate the market.

As in so many other businesses, [the **major shareholders**
are]{.underline} often [**investment funds**. Blackrock controlled more
than 4 per cent of]{.underline} the [equity in 10 of the 200 companies.
Others include]{.underline} The [Vanguard]{.underline} Group, [Van
Eck]{.underline} Associates [and First Eagle]{.underline} Invesment
Management. [**All four** are]{.underline} headquartered [in the
**US**]{.underline}.

There are some mining billionaires from the EU. For example,
Spain's Daniel Maté and Greece's Telis Mistakidis, who each control
around 3 per cent of Glencore, the Swiss commodity giant with the fourth
largest market capitalisation. Others have enormous fortunes, even if
their companies are not among the top 200, such as the French Duval
family, which control Eramet, a major nickel producer.

As of now, most [**mining fortunes** are **not made in
Europe**]{.underline}. The majors operate 17 CRM mines in the EU, mostly
copper. They have seven other projects in the pipeline to extract
lithium, cobalt, copper or nickel. Those companies also have five metal
recycling or processing plants, four of them already operative. The
International Energy Agency estimates there are between 40 and 50
critical raw materials mines in the EU today. Euromines' Kuby wants to
see this number doubled in the next decade.

Can this situation change in the future, as the EU hopes will happen
with its new mining legislation? Perhaps the answer lies with EU
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. "The way you do mining is absolutely
essential. Many credit institutions will not touch you unless they think
you are in control of how you deal with the people who live where the
mines are, how you deal with the environmental offence, and how you can
restore the area once you are done," Vestager told Investigate Europe.

### US Says No\-\--2AC

Critical Minerals: Similarly, [no agreement was reached on **critical
minerals**]{.underline}, despite cited negotiation progress on allowing
tax credits for EVs that uses EU-produced minerals like cobalt,
graphite, lithium, manganese, and nickel. [U.S. insistence
on]{.underline} a [**rapid inspection system** of mines and processing
of critical minerals in Europe was **too difficult** for the EU to
**swallow** and would]{.underline} likely [require approval
by]{.underline} the [**27 member states**, a process that can be **long
and tedious**]{.underline}. However, since the EU also needs critical
minerals for its own EVs, talks between the EU and U.S. also center on
how to work jointly to reduce dependence on China in the EV battery
supply chain and increase investments in new minerals projects in
resource rich countries such as in Africa and Latin America. But no
progress on such talks was reported though officials are privately more
upbeat that a deal can be reached in the near future.

Good morning from Nuuk! It's really great to be here. I want to thank
Minister Nathanielsen and the Government of Greenland for hosting us
today, and i welcome all of [the Minerals Security Partnership (or
"MSP")]{.underline} partner representatives with us in person as well as
those joining us virtually.

[This multilateral **government-to-government**]{.underline} dialogue
[is a]{.underline} unique [opportunity to hear about Greenland's mineral
resource potential, understand]{.underline} key [aspects of
Greenland's]{.underline} competitive [investment frameworks, and learn
about]{.underline} current [opportunities for investment in **late-stage
exploration**, mine project **development**]{.underline}, and supply
chain buildout. Greenland can play an essential role in supporting MSP
objectives and ensuring the security, diversification, and
sustainability of global supply chains for critical minerals.

As we will hear, [Greenland has world-class mineral resource
investment]{.underline} opportunities and a commitment to sustainable
development. These resources have only been lightly explored and
developed to date. Together, we have an opportunity to unlock so much
potential. When we launched the minerals security partnership over two
years ago, we prioritized high environment, labor, social, and
governance practices. The aim was to benefit many stakeholders,
including producing countries, laborers, local communities, our
environment, and consumers. With that in mind, I welcome this chance to
listen to our hosts and to chart a course to bring those intended
benefits here to Greenland, an MSP Forum member.

[This MSP partners meeting will be followed, after a **lunch

#### India doesn't have the right minerals [or]{.underline} capacity to solve.

India's Rare Earth Roadblocks

As [India]{.underline} embarks on a plan for [domestic production of
rare earth magnets]{.underline}, it is looking to enter a sophisticated
technological arena currently controlled by a select few international
manufacturers.

The initiative, supported by government funding and strategic planning,
[is]{.underline} ambitious yet **[complex]{.underline}**.

Take the [case of neodymium magnets]{.underline} - despite their small
size, they are **[crucial]{.underline}** components powering
contemporary technology - [from **EVs** and **wind** energy systems
to]{.underline} mobile devices and **[defence equipment]{.underline}**.

The [manufacturing process requires specific combinations of light rare
earth elements]{.underline} including neodymium and praseodymium, along
with trace amounts of heavy rare earths such as dysprosium and terbium -
[materials that present **significant challenges** in]{.underline} both
[procurement and processing]{.underline}.

The [development of]{.underline} an [end-to-end domestic supply chain
for rare earth magnets in India faces **significant
challenges**]{.underline} as listed in an ET report, and [finding
solutions to these obstacles presents **considerable
difficulty**]{.underline}.

Hurdle: Where are the mineral deposits?

[India currently produces]{.underline} approximately [2900 tons of rare
earths, consisting **entirely of light rare earths**, with a notable
absence of **essential** heavy rare earths]{.underline}.

[India\'s primary]{.underline} rare earth [deposits are found in coastal
beach sands, with typically **low mineral content**. A recent
finding]{.underline} in a Gujarat tribal village [was]{.underline}
finally [found to be **ultra-fine**]{.underline}, micron-sized
[particles, rendering extraction both technically challenging and
**financially unfeasible**]{.underline}.

The Geological Survey of [India]{.underline} (GSI) [has
redirected]{.underline} its [exploration efforts
**inland**]{.underline}, particularly towards Rajasthan, [though **no
substantial deposits**]{.underline} of magnet-grade rare earths [have
been verified]{.underline} yet, the ET report said.

GSI has investigated 51 locations in the past four years, with 16
surveys conducted in FY25, increasing from 10 in FY22.

All these sites are situated in Rajasthan, indicating a strategic move
away from coastal regions.

The [outcomes have been **limited**]{.underline}, with only three
locations - examined in FY22 and FY23 - identified for neodymium and
related rare earths including dysprosium.

These sites remain at the G4 exploration phase (preliminary
reconnaissance).

Ladi Ka Bas in Rajasthan is the sole site progressed to G2 level, though
GSI has not explicitly confirmed the presence of magnet metals there.

Who will extract the rare earths?

IREL (India) Ltd, operating under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE),
is the exclusive producer of rare earth elements in India. This public
sector enterprise maintains the country\'s monopoly in rare earth
production.

The organisation extracts rare earths as a secondary product whilst
mining beach sand, specifically from monazite, which is classified as a
radioactive mineral and falls under atomic energy regulations.

To establish an effective magnet supply chain, [India requires
**comprehensive integration** across various sectors including mining,
separation, refining, materials science and magnet
production]{.underline}. Currently, the [country **lacks**]{.underline}
these [capabilities at a **substantial scale**]{.underline}.

Reports indicate that the Department of Atomic Energy and Ministry of
Heavy Industries (MHI) are in the final stages of developing a
production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for rare earth magnets. The
initiative, allocated Rs 1,000 crore, targets domestic production of
1,500 tonnes of rare earth magnets. This amount represents merely 5% of
India\'s projected requirement of 30,000 tonnes. IREL\'s contribution
will comprise approximately 500 tonnes of raw materials.

IREL\'s core business remains focused on ilmenite, which generates
substantial revenue through titanium dioxide pigment production for
paints, alongside other industrial minerals including rutile, zircon,
and sillimanite. [Their involvement in rare earth elements]{.underline},
particularly magnet metals, [is currently at a **nascent
stage**]{.underline}, despite increased attention.

https://www.reuters.com/business/us-export-import-bank-considers-120-million-loan-greenland-rare-earths-project-2025-06-15/\]

June 15 (Reuters) - [[Critical Metals Corp]{.underline}]{.mark}
(CRML.O), opens new tab [has [received a letter of interest from]{.mark}
[the U.S. Export-Import Bank]{.mark}]{.underline} (EXIM) [[for a loan
worth]{.mark}]{.underline} up to [\$[120 million to
fund]{.mark}]{.underline} the company\'s Tanbreez [[rare earths mine in
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, in what would be the Trump
administration\'s first overseas investment in a mining project.

[[The loan]{.mark},]{.underline} if approved, [[would **boost U.S.
access to minerals**]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly at the center of
global economic trade [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} help **[[offset the
country\'s reliance on]{.underline}]{.mark}** market leader
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It also comes after President Donald
Trump openly mused earlier this year about acquiring the Danish island
territory, an overture that has been repeatedly rejected.

In a letter dated June 12 and reviewed by Reuters, New York-based
Critical Metals has met initial requirements to apply for the \$120
million EXIM loan and, if approved, would have a 15-year repayment term,
longer than the company likely would have with private financing.

The project would have to be \"well-capitalized with sufficient equity
from strategic investors\" to receive the loan, the letter said.

EXIM, which acts as the U.S. government\'s export credit agency, said in
the letter that Critical Metals qualifies for a loan program designed to
support companies that compete with China.

The Tanbreez project is expected to cost \$290 million and the [[EXIM
funds would]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to fund technical work and
[[get the mine to initial production by **2026**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Once fully operational, [[the mine is]{.mark} [expected to produce
85,000 metric tons per year of a rare earths concentrate and two minor
metals]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"This funding package is expected to unlock significant value for our
project and our stakeholders,\" said Tony Sage, the company\'s CEO.

Representatives for EXIM were not immediately available to comment.

The move is the latest in a series of supportive actions by Washington
toward the Tanbreez deposit and Greenland\'s mining sector. Reuters
reported in January that former President Joe Biden\'s administration
had successfully lobbied privately held Tanbreez Mining not to sell to a
Chinese developer and instead sell to Critical Metals.

COPENHAGEN, June 19 (Reuters) - [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} on
Thursday [[handed a **30-year permit**]{.mark} [to a
E]{.mark}]{.underline}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion-backed
[[project]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that aims to mine
molybdenum]{.underline}]{.mark}, a critical metal used in aerospace,
energy and defence and on which China has imposed export controls.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} resource-rich Arctic [[island]{.underline}
[has seen **rising activity** in its mining sector]{.underline}]{.mark}
over the past month, after U.S. President Donald Trump expressed an
interest in purchasing it earlier this year.

[The permit was granted to Toronto-listed Greenland
Resources]{.underline} (MOLY.NLB), opens new tab, a company backed by
the European Raw Material Alliance, and holds the licence to the
Malmbjerg project in eastern Greenland, the country\'s government said
in a statement.

[[The]{.mark} open pit Malmbjerg [mine can produce]{.mark}]{.underline}
an average [[**32.8 million pounds** of]{.mark} concentrated
[molybdenum]{.mark}]{.underline} per year, potentially supplying around
25% of Europe\'s molybdenum use, according to the company.

Molybdenum is a silvery-white metal used primarily to strengthen steel
and improve its resistance to heat and corrosion, making it critical for
industrial applications such defence and clean energy.

China imposed export controls in early February on five metals,
including molybdenum-related products, in response to U.S. President
Donald Trump\'s tariff on Chinese goods.

China accounted for about 40% of global molybdenum production last year,
according to U.S. Geological Survey. Molybdenum is considered a critical
mineral by both the European Union and the United States.

Earlier this year, [Greenland Resources]{.underline} [signed off-take
agreements with Finland\'s Outokumpu]{.underline} (OUT1V.HE), opens new
tab and Italy\'s Cogne Acciai Speciali.

Although rich in natural resources, development of Greenland\'s mining
industry has been slow due to bureaucracy and lack of financing.

However, [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} last month
[[granted]{.underline} [an **exploitation licence** to a Danish-French
mining group]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} while the EU this month
picked 13 new critical material projects, including a graphite project

[[Brunswick Exploration]{.underline}]{.mark} Inc. Feb. 18
[[outlined]{.underline}]{.mark} its 2025 summer [[**exploration plans**
in Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which include]{.mark} [the
expansion of]{.mark} its]{.underline} Paamiut **[[lithium
project]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- an underexplored property with
historical reports of lithium mineralization -- [and]{.underline}
[planned exploration [at]{.mark} the recently discovered
[Ivisaartoq]{.mark}]{.underline} spodumene-bearing pegmatite trend, the
first confirmed lithium discovery in the country.

Headquartered in Montreal, Brunswick Exploration emerged from the
restructuring of Komet Resources Inc., a former gold-focused junior with
assets in West Africa.

Longtime director Robert Wares, a co-founder and key figure in Osisko
Mining Inc.\'s success, took the helm as chairman in 2019, overseeing
the divestment of Komet\'s African holdings and its pivot to lithium and
other energy metals.

With a new focus, the company built a portfolio of exploration projects
across Canada, targeting underexplored pegmatite fields in Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and the Atlantic provinces.

This includes major lithium discoveries at Mirage, Anatacau, and Elrond
in the Eeyou Istchee-James Bay region of Quebec.

[In 2023]{.underline}, [[Brunswick]{.mark} expanded]{.underline} its
[reach into Greenland]{.underline}, [becoming the first company to
confirm a lithium-bearing spodumene pegmatite in the
country]{.underline}. Alongside Ivisaartoq, [the]{.underline}
[company]{.underline} has since [[secured one]{.mark} [of the **largest
lithium**]{.mark}]{.underline}-focused exploration
[[portfolios]{.underline}]{.mark} in Greenland, which also includes the
underexplored Paamiut project.

pegmatite trend spanning approximately [[three
kilometers]{.underline}]{.mark} by 1.5 kilometers (1.9 miles by 0.9
miles).

Within this trend, Brunswick has traced a discovery dyke for roughly 400
meters, with an exposed width of up to five meters. Early sampling
returned lithium oxide (Li2O) grades of up to 2.4%, with spodumene
concentrations reaching 50% in some sections.

[[Nalunaq]{.mark}]{.underline} updated Mineral Resource Estimate
[[confirmed a significant **51% increase** in]{.mark} overall [contained
gold]{.mark}]{.underline}, to 326.3koz at 29.2 g/t Inferred plus a
maiden Indicated Resource of 157.6koz at 32.4 g/t, demonstrating the
robust expansion potential of the Nalunaq deposit. Post period end the
updated off-site, conclusive fire assay results have significantly
upgraded the previously reported underground drilling, confirming
stronger intersections including 78.3 g/t Au over 1.72 m, (see detailed
tables at the end of the release).

[[**Construction and commissioning** of the]{.mark} process
[plant]{.mark} [continued]{.mark}]{.underline} during Q1 2025, following
first gold pour at the end of 2024.

As previously reported, typical commissioning issues while working in
Southern Greenland over the winter months resulted in some delays
impacting the ramp-up pace during Q1-2025.

During Q1 2025, [focus remained on enhancing]{.underline} the efficiency
of the [mining teams and ensuring availability of
equipment.]{.underline} To improve development rates, the Company set
new KPIs for the on-site mining contractor, involving increasing the
contractor's staffing levels and fleet size to match the production
profile. In this context, [[performance-boosting
equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as an **electric double boom
rig**]{.mark} and a single boom rig [were deployed]{.mark}]{.underline}
to site, along with a second long hole rig.

[[Mining op]{.underline}]{.mark}eration[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}
successfully [[focussed on **ramp development**]{.underline}]{.mark},
while extending the ore drives into the resource base. Notably, the
first stope was successfully blasted at the beginning of March 2025.

Meeting these performance criteria will enable mining to supply the
processing plant with sufficient ore to ramp up to full production
rates, [[concurrently with the completion of construction]{.mark} and
full configuration of the plant's operational equipment]{.underline} to
design capability.

Good [progress at the Hydropower project near Nalunaq]{.underline}, with
the pre-feasibility study finalised showing positive preliminary
results. Project preparation, design and schedule [are expected to be
complete]{.underline} by the end of 2025 with construction starting in
2026.

The Company is now planning to proceed with the construction and
installation of Phase 2 in Q4 2025. This will provide additional time
for the commissioning and ramp-up Phase 1, as well as to complete
engineering studies aimed at upgrading the processing throughput
capacity from the current nameplate of 300 t/d to 450 t/d.

Post-period Highlights

Post period end, [[good **mining process has
continued**]{.mark},]{.underline} with the integration of MRE4 into the
mining plan, which when combined with the increased grades from the
fire-assay results allows optimisation of the mining fleet and more
effective operations to target ore body.

Construction, commissioning and calibration of the processing facilities
has continued into Q2 2025.

[[Positive progress has been achieved with]{.mark}
i]{.underline}ncreasing average daily processing rates continuing into
[Q2 2025,]{.underline} when including stoppages for commissioning,
calibration and rotation, with process capacity regularly reaching 250
t/d.

Average grades while in the commissioning and trial mining stage of a
project vary, however as we experience more uptime from the processing
unit, grades have been improving and in accordance with the mine plan.

Outlook for 2025

There has been [significant operational progress]{.underline} since the
conclusion of Q1 2025. With continued up time in mine development rates
and processing throughput. We continue to target a run rate production
of 300t/d in Q4 2025. During this commissioning phase and as a result of
promising operational progress the [[Company expects **full year gold
production**]{.underline}]{.mark} to be in the range of 5 -- 20koz; a
wide range at this stage due to the nature of the trial mining and
commissioning year. This for example entails stopping operations while
we install the final automated electrical systems, water system and the
phase 2 flotation system. There is however potential to narrow this
guidance range as we progress operations through the remainder of the
year. Once full ramp up is achieved, the Company will provide its
outlook for the full year run rate in 2026.

Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA): [[**Greenland** mandates
comprehensive **EIAs** for all mining projects]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These [assessments]{.underline}, [[based on **baseline** studies]{.mark}
conducted over 2-3 years]{.underline}, [aim to
**identify**]{.underline}, evaluate, [and [**mitigate** potential
environmental effects before **operations**]{.mark}]{.underline}
commence. This process [ensures]{.underline} that [mining activities are
environmentally **sound** and **sustainable**]{.underline}.

Regulatory Framework: The [**[Greenland]{.mark}**ic
government]{.underline} has [[implemented]{.mark} a [new **Act** on
**Mineral Activities**]{.mark}]{.underline} from January 1, 2024. This
legislation [[encompasses]{.mark} **143 articles** detailing
[requirements]{.mark}]{.underline} for mining operations,
[including]{.underline} that exploitation **[license]{.underline}**
holders must establish a Greenlandic limited company with management
based in Greenland. The act also emphasizes the use of local labor and
suppliers, as well as local production, to maximize benefits for
Greenland.

Infrastructure and Logistics: Greenland\'s harsh climate, hazardous
shipping conditions, and limited infrastructure present significant
challenges to mining operations. The lack of roads, ports, and energy
supplies in remote areas increases operational costs and complexities,
necessitating substantial upfront investments to develop the necessary
infrastructure.

Community Engagement and Social Responsibility: Engaging with local
communities and ensuring that mining projects contribute positively to
their development is crucial. This includes creating employment
opportunities, investing in local infrastructure, and respecting
indigenous cultures and traditions.

Sustainable Practices: [[Adopting **environmentally friendly** mining
practices]{.mark} is essential]{.underline}. For instance, [Greenland
Anorthosite **Mining** [emphasizes]{.mark}]{.underline} that mining and
[[processing]{.underline}]{.mark} anorthosite [[is
**straightforward**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[requires **minimal**
energy]{.underline},]{.mark} [[and produces **no harmful
waste**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[By-products]{.underline}]{.mark} can be
[[utilized in]{.underline}]{.mark} road
**[[construction]{.underline}]{.mark}** or stored safely, [[contributing

#### The use of hydropower can create cleaner mining

Matt **Simon 25,** a senior staff writer at Grist, 3/26/25, Resilience,
"Beneath Greenland's ice lies a climate solution --- and a new
geopolitical battleground,"

Lynge says that [[a win-win for Greenlanders]{.mark} [would be to
support mining]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but insist that it's run on
**hydropower**]{.mark} instead of fossil fuels.]{.underline} [[The
island has]{.underline}]{.mark} huge [[potential for
hydropower]{.underline}]{.mark}, and indeed has been approving more
projects and expanding another existing facility. Still, no amount of
hydropower can negate the impact of mining on the landscape. "There's no
sustainable mining in the world," Lynge said. "The question is if we can
do it a little bit better."

Critical Metals Corp., for its part, says that it expects to produce
minimal harmful products at its site. [[Like other mining
projects]{.mark} [in Greenland]{.mark}, [it will need to pass an
**environmental review**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "We expect to provide
more updates about our plans to reduce our environmental footprint as we
get closer to mining operations," said Tony Sage, the company's CEO and
executive chairman, in a statement provided to Grist. "With that, we
believe it is important to keep in mind that rare earth elements are
critical materials for cleaner applications, which will help us build a
greener planet in the future."

#### Environmentally sustainable mining will be possible

Jens **Søndergaard 22**, Professor, MD, PhD, Head of Research Unit of
General Practice in Odense and in Esbjerg, Department of Public Health,
University of Southern Denmark, 3/15/22, "Mining pollution in
Greenland - the lesson learned: A review of 50 years of environmental
studies and monitoring,"
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152373, igo

[[In Greenland]{.mark},]{.underline} research and [[monitoring results
have been included]{.underline}]{.mark} in the efforts [[to establish
**environmentally safe threshold**]{.mark} [limits]{.mark} for
pollutants]{.underline} in seawater, freshwater and air (MRA, 2015) to
be applied [[when awarding mining]{.mark}
[licenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[monitoring results are
used for]{.underline}]{.mark} continuous
[[evaluation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} in some cases also
**[regulation]{.underline}** [of ongoing activities]{.underline} in
order [[to **minimise environmental impact**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[For
example]{.underline}]{.mark}, previous environmental monitoring
identified [[significant pollution from]{.underline}]{.mark} a large
waste rock dump at [[Maarmorilik]{.underline}]{.mark} during the mining
period, which [[led to a]{.mark} [decision to remove
it]{.mark}]{.underline} as part of the mine closure in 1990. This has
likely reduced the overall environmental impact at Maarmorilik
significantly in the long term. However, since the waste rock dump was
situated on a steep mountainside and extended down into the fjord and
much of the waste rock was inaccessible or had become part of the
permafrost, its complete removal was not possible. [[At]{.mark} [Seqi, a
dust dispersion issue was identified]{.mark}]{.underline} by the
monitoring program during the mine operation. [In consequence, the
[authorities demanded initiation of mitigation
actions]{.mark},]{.underline} and a dust suppressant was subsequently
applied to the roads. This led to reduced dust dispersion (Søndergaard
and Asmund, 2011), and no significant dust dispersion has been observed
in the surrounding area at Seqi after the mine closure (Søndergaard,
2019).

Also, various lessons have been learned with regard to minimising the
environmental impact at Greenland mine sites based on the results of the
past [research and monitoring]{.underline}. These [have been applied in
other projects]{.underline} and include, among others, the importance of
thorough geochemical leach testing of mine waste types such as waste
rock and tailings prior to operation (as summed up in Søndergaard et
al., 2018) and taking these results and site-specific conditions into
account when depositing the waste. Specifically, waste containing
elements and minerals of environmental concern, as identified by the
leach testing, should never be deposited at exposed mountain slopes or
in the sea, where it is difficult or impossible to access, control and
retrieve (as in Maarmorilik) or in the tidal zone, where it is exposed
to high rates of leaching and transport (as in Ivittuut). Tailings
should be deposited following the principles of Best Available
Technology/Best Environmental Practice, and site- and mine-specific
factors must be considered, implying that tailings should never be
deposited in riverbeds exposed to erosion, water and wind transport (as
in Mestersvig). In areas with permafrost, waste materials are likely to
be very difficult to retrieve if they become frozen and may need
blasting to be removed with the associated risk of dust dispersion of
pollutants. Therefore, it is critical to adopt an adequate long-term
solution in these areas before the disposal. Furthermore, the ongoing
climate change affecting temperatures and precipitation must be
considered for long-term storage. Climate change is a significant
unknown regarding the tailings deposit near Tunnel River at Mestersvig
and the waste rock deposit in Maarmorilik, where a significant amount of
material is now frozen but may thaw in the future and thus become
exposed to weathering, leaching and transport, potentially augmenting
the pollution here.

[[The experiences gained]{.mark},]{.underline} together with knowledge
obtained [from mines]{.underline} in other parts of the world,
[are]{.underline} now [part of the knowledge base at DCE and GINR and
**[form the basis for the advisory work]{.mark}**]{.underline} provided
t[o the Greenland authorities [on mining projects]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This [[advisory work includes **evaluation of
EIAs**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} environmental requirements [[and
**conditions in licenses**]{.underline}]{.mark} and more ad-hoc advising
on environmental issues during the different phases of the mining
operations.

#### Greenland's government will ensure [environmentally sustainable mining]{.underline} 

Jens **Søndergaard 22**, Professor, MD, PhD, Head of Research Unit of
General Practice in Odense and in Esbjerg, Department of Public Health,
University of Southern Denmark, 3/15/22, "Mining pollution in
Greenland - the lesson learned: A review of 50 years of environmental
studies and monitoring,"
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152373, igo

In the coming years, [there are [plans to supplement monitoring at mine
sites]{.mark}]{.underline} at local scale [in Greenland]{.underline}
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[extensive]{.underline}]{.mark}
regional [[monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark} in selected areas[,
[including]{.mark}]{.underline} also **[[assessment of cumulative
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}** (disturbance from increased shipping,
helicopter transport etc.) in the areas of concern. Furthermore, [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[potential to **involve the local**]{.mark}
**[community]{.mark}**]{.underline} near a mine site in the monitoring
[[to take advantage of local ecological knowledge]{.underline}, [to
build local]{.underline}]{.mark} [[confidence]{.mark} to the
environmental protection]{.underline} and ensure a social 'license to
operate' for mining companies. This is [[beneficial]{.underline}]{.mark}
for establishing a mining industry (involving also 'small-scale mining')
[[in areas where the local population]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [closely
connected to the landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}, and where both the
economy and food security are based on local fishing and hunting. With
regard to future research, [[knowledge]{.mark} gained from
past]{.underline} and current research at [mine sites in
Greenland]{.underline} and elsewhere, along with the ongoing development
of mine sites in Greenland and the environmental challenges that they
pose, [[will form the basis]{.mark} [for the direction of the
research]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [[technological
advances]{.underline}]{.mark} and applied research constantly
[[create]{.underline} [new]{.underline}]{.mark} [[opportunities to
improve]{.underline}]{.mark} and extend [methods for **[environmental
monitoring]{.mark}**]{.underline} at mine sites and for minimising the
environmental impact of mining. Environmental monitoring plays a key
role in minimising the environmental impact of mining. In Greenland,
some of the old mines have a legacy of long-lasting pollution, and
practices for environmental monitoring have evolved over the years
following extensive research conducted at these mine sites. Thus,
[monitoring results at Greenland]{.underline} [mine]{.underline}
site[s]{.underline} have formed the basis [for]{.underline}
decision-making and [regulation of mining activities]{.underline} and
have assisted in reducing adverse environmental effects in several
cases. From the Greenland monitoring and research results, it is evident
that monitoring programs should always be adapted specifically to the
mine site of concern, and the adapted monitoring programs should include
a diverse suite of techniques including both chemical/physical and
biological tools. Programs should also take temporal variations in the
discharge of pollutants unique to the Arctic into account, such as
spring flushes of winter-generated pollutants or seasonal hydrographical
processes in the fjords. [Owing to the continued research in mining
areas]{.underline} and the development of new techniques,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} future [[environmental monitoring]{.mark} [of
mining activities in Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is likely to
encompass]{.underline}]{.mark} a range of additional [[tools for
assessing]{.mark} [environmental impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Future
monitoring programs may also include results from regional monitoring
programs and assessment of cumulative effects of mining activities on a
larger scale. The current climate change with increasing temperatures in
the Arctic calls for continuing the monitoring of legacy mine sites due
to thawing of previously frozen material, increasing weathering rates
and changes in the hydrological regime that may affect the release of
pollutants.

The question of how to pull off this balancing act is one of the many

"[[We]{.mark} are going to [need to **mine more** to mitigate

Copper, lithium, cobalt and nickel are just some metals from a long list

Apart from contributing to the global reduction of carbon pollution, the
renewable energy sources in Greenland are a business opportunity.
[[Greenland has]{.underline}]{.mark} significant **[[untapped hydropower
resources]{.mark},]{.underline}** which exceed our domestic demand
multiple times. [We are]{.underline} currently [in the process of
opening for investors]{.underline} who can help us develop these areas.
Our ambition is to become a net exporter of renewable energy within a
decade or two.

[[Companies are interested in renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy
source[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Greenland
receives great interest in its vast deposits of [[critical
minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which are crucial for the **global
green transition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Please, let me be very clear:
[Greenland is open for the development of mining for greener
solutions]{.underline}, including our vast rare earth deposits. As a
free market economy [[we are open to engage]{.underline} [in
partnerships]{.underline}]{.mark} [[with]{.mark}
[anyone]{.mark}]{.underline} [[who will **abide by our
laws**]{.mark},]{.underline} and in projects that will benefit the
people of Greenland.

[[In 2021]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[our parliament adopted
a]{.underline}]{.mark} new [[law **banning** any **mining with a uranium
concentration**]{.underline}]{.mark} higher than 100 parts per million
(ppm) [[to]{.mark} ensure clean and safe mining]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} effectively [[protect]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark} and abundant natural resources found
in Greenland. At the same time, we remain a pro-mining nation and
welcome mining projects that keep within the limits of the established
thresholds for uranium.

It is a broadly shared vision in Greenland that [minerals]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} constitute a significant part of the future economy,
and this will benefit not only the local population, but also the global
community. The world has become increasingly focused on the need to
[facilitate a green transition]{.underline}, which for many countries
and companies, requires greater dedication to produce wind turbines,
electric networks, and electric cars, all of which require a variety of
critical minerals. With some of the largest critical mineral deposits in
the world, Greenland is a natural partner in the green transition.

## Greenland Independence DA

### UQ\-\--Independence\-\--2AC

#### Independence is inevitable in Greenland's political trajectory\-\--Constitutional law and cross-party consensus guarantee the right to secede once the timing aligns with public support and economic readiness.

**Bas '25** \[Camille; March 9; Nordic Correspondent and Reporter for
the Agence France-Presse; Barron\'s, "Greenland\'s Road To Independence,

//jwh

**[[Independence]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been the [[**focus**
of]{.mark} **campaigning** ahead of [Greenland\'s]{.mark} **legislative
[elections]{.mark}**]{.underline} Tuesday, a prospect foreseen by the
Danish [[**constitution** with **legislation** **already** in **place**
**outlining**]{.underline}]{.mark} how to make [[it]{.mark}
happen]{.underline}.

[[**All** of Greenland\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} main [political [parties
**back independence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, so debate has largely
centred on when \-- not if \-- to cut ties with Denmark.

The roadmap is already laid out.

Article 19 of Denmark\'s constitution authorises the Danish government
to cede part of its territory as long as it has parliament\'s approval.

\"The general understanding is that it would be possible to give away
part of the country, or for Greenland to become independent, without a
constitutional amendment and without changing the Danish constitution,\"
Frederik Waage, a professor at the University of Southern Denmark, told
AFP.

[Greenland\'s **[2009]{.mark}**]{.underline} self-rule [[**law**,
\"establishes]{.mark} basically a [**road map** for
**independence**]{.mark}]{.underline}\", he said.

Its Article 21 states that a \"[**decision** regarding Greenland\'s
**independence**]{.underline} shall be [[taken by the **people** of
**Greenland**]{.underline}]{.mark}\".

Talks should then be held between the Danish and Greenlandic governments
to reach an agreement, it says.

That accord must then be [**approved** by the **Greenlandic
parliament**, **endorsed** by a **referendum**]{.underline} on the
island, [and **concluded** with the]{.underline} consent of the
**[Danish parliament]{.underline}**.

Defining Greenlanders

\"Independence for Greenland shall imply that Greenland assumes
sovereignty over the Greenland territory,\" the text states.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly acknowledged that
\"the self-rule law clearly stipulates that the [**future** of
**Greenland** is to be **defined** by **Greenland**]{.underline} and
Greenlanders\".

[[Even]{.underline}]{.mark} US President [Donald
**[Trump]{.mark}**]{.underline}, addressing the US Congress on March 4,
[[acknowledged]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the \"**incredible people**\"
of [Greenland had the **right** to **self-
determination**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"And [[if you **choose**, we **welcome** you into the
**U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates of America**]{.underline},\" he
said, promising to [make them \"**rich**\" and keep them
\"**safe**]{.underline}\".

#### Greenland remains under Danish sovereignty but momentum for independence is accelerating\-\--Recent constitutional moves and electoral shifts show sovereignty is live but not yet realized, preserving U.S.-Danish stability for now.

//jwh

[Greenland]{.underline} has been **[considered]{.underline}** a [Danish
**territory** for more than **three hundred** years]{.underline}, but it
wasn't until 1979 that Denmark granted the sparsely populated island
home rule. [In **2009**, [Denmark passed]{.mark} the **[Act on Greenland
Self-Government]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[PDF\], significantly
**[[expanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** the island's [[**authority**
over]{.mark} its **[domestic affairs]{.mark}**, including]{.underline}
the [**police**, **courts**, and **coast guard**. [Denmark still
**maintains control**]{.mark} over Greenland's **foreign
affairs**]{.underline}, defense policy, and monetary policy,
[[providing]{.underline}]{.mark} an annual [[**subsidy**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately **[[\$500
million]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

As part of Denmark, which is a founding member of NATO, Greenland is
covered under the transatlantic alliance's security guarantees. However,
Greenland is not a member of the European Union (EU) or the European
Single Market despite being considered an overseas country and territory
associated with the EU. Greenland's roughly fifty-seven thousand
citizens, the majority Indigenous Inuit, are EU citizens as well as
Danish nationals.

In recent years, [**[Greenland]{.mark}** has [witnessed]{.mark} a
**[growing independence]{.mark}** movement. Under]{.underline} the
[self-government **act**, the island [can **gain**]{.mark}
[**independence** via a **referendum**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
approval from the Danish Parliament. [In **2023**, [Greenland
**unveiled**]{.mark} its]{.underline} first **[[draft
constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, calling for the [[**creation**
of]{.mark} a **[Greenlandic republic]{.mark}**, **independence** from
**Denmark**]{.underline}, and recognition of the island's Inuit
heritage. In mid-March, Greenland's center-right Demokraatik
party---which advocates for a gradual approach to independence---won the
island's parliamentary election, underscoring residents' desire for
greater sovereignty.

#### Greenland inches toward independence\-\--Pro-independence parties gain power, signaling long-term separation from Denmark.

**Neuman '25** \[Scott and Willem Marx; March 13; Correspondent at the
Enterprise Desk for National Public Radio; NPR, "What Greenland\'s
elections mean for the island --- and the U.S.,"
npr.org/2025/03/13/nx-s1-5325949/greenland-elections-trump-independence\]
//jwh

[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[soon have]{.mark} a **new**
government led by]{.underline} a [**pro-independence**
party]{.underline} --- signaling what could be an [**eventual
[split]{.mark}** [from Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}. Is that a win for
President Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to annex the island?

Campaign posters hang outside a polling station ahead of Greenland\'s
March 11 election, in Ilulissat, Greenland. The [island will
**[elect]{.mark}** the **31 members** of its parliament]{.underline},
called the **[Inatsisartut]{.underline}**. Greenland was due to hold
elections by April 6, but Prime Minister Mute Egede called for an
[**early vote** amid the **geopolitical tensions**]{.underline} stoked
by President Trump\'s vow to take control of the autonomous Danish
territory.

After all, voters rejected Greenland\'s current Prime Minister Múte
Egede, whose Inuit Ataqatigiit party came in third in Tuesday\'s polls.
Egede has insisted that Greenland is not for sale and he framed the
polling partly as a referendum on Trump\'s seemingly bellicose bullying,
saying the election was a \"fateful choice.\"

But observers say the victory for [[Greenland\'s]{.mark}
**center-right** **[Demokraatit]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Democracy)
[[party]{.underline}]{.mark}, which won the largest portion of
parliamentary seats, with [**30%** of the vote]{.underline}, guarantees
neither a [**quick** move toward **independence**]{.underline} nor
closer ties with the U.S.

For starters, the Demokraatit party has also been highly critical of
Trump\'s rhetoric, insisting that their island --- the world\'s largest
--- has the right to self-determination. The party\'s leader and
Greenland\'s likely next prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, has
called Trump \"a threat to our political independence.\"

The Demokraatit party also favors a go-slow approach to independence,
with a gradual strengthening of the island\'s economy, which is heavily
reliant on fishing exports and direct subsidies from Denmark, before
going it alone.

Meanwhile, Naleraq --- another center-right party --- wants to
[[**fast-track** independence]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has in the past
been more [[**receptive** to the U.S.]{.mark} president\'s
**[message]{.mark}**]{.underline} and came in second in the balloting.
But it\'s not yet clear if it will be [[**invited** to **join** the
**new government**]{.underline}]{.mark} or be bypassed for a coalition
between the Demokraatit party and smaller parties.

Greenland\'s strategic importance is growing, especially as a warming
climate may open up new Arctic shipping routes in the coming decades.
Just 950 miles from the North Pole, the U.S. operates Pituffik Space
Base there, a key facility for missile defenses monitoring.
Additionally, as Trump has often pointed out, Greenland is thought to be
rich in rare earth minerals.

The [U.S. wants [**access** to Greenland\'s **resources**]{.mark}
to]{.underline} help [**break** the U.S. **dependency** on
China]{.underline}, which has a near-monopoly on some critical elements
used in the technology and defense industries. But mining in Greenland
is challenging, with a lack of infrastructure, harsh climate and
pushback from local communities.

#### Alt causes to independence\-\--Trump will cause secession before anything else.

**Kent '25** \[Lauren; March 11; Senior News Desk Reporter for CNN; CNN,
"As Greenland goes to the polls, Trump's aggressive stance has

But [[Trump's]{.mark} **aggressive** [stance]{.mark}]{.underline} has
actually [[give]{.mark}n [the]{.mark} Arctic [nation more **bargaining**
power with Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}, analysts say, and
[**[kicked]{.mark}** the **[independence]{.mark}** movement [into **high
gear**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Independence isn't on the ballot for Tuesday's election, but the other
partner in Greenland's two-party government coalition, [the **Siumut**
party]{.underline}, has said it [plans to hold a referendum on
**independence**]{.underline} within the next election period. The main
opposition party, [[Naleraq]{.underline}]{.mark}, has [[campaigned to
**sever ties** with Denmark]{.mark} more **quickly** [and]{.mark} wants

//jwh

Over the past 25 years, [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[made
**significant** strides toward **reducing**]{.mark} its [**reliance** on
the Danish]{.mark} block grant]{.underline}. While [the
grant's]{.underline} nominal value has grown from 2.4 billion DKK in
1994 to 4.1 billion DKK in 2023, its [**share** of Greenland's
GDP]{.underline} has [**declined** dramatically]{.underline}---from 30%
in 2003 [to just **19%**]{.underline} in 2021, based on data from
Statistics Greenland. This marks an [**important** step
toward]{.underline} financial independence and reflects a growing,
[**diversifying** economy]{.underline}.

The Declining Importance of the Block Grant

According to the 2024 political-economic report: Økonomisk Råd Rapport
2. halvår 2024, the block grant remains a vital part of Greenland's
public finances, accounting for 50-51% of government revenue. According
to the report, [[the grant's]{.mark} **relative** [share of
GDP]{.mark}]{.underline} however [[reached its **lowest-ever**]{.mark}
level [of **18.7%**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2023, as Greenland's economy
continues to expand, [[driven by **growth** in]{.underline}]{.mark} key
sectors such as [[**fisheries**, **tourism**, and
**construction**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The report also outlines [[fiscal reforms]{.mark} **implemented** by the
government]{.underline}, including resource rent taxation, which
[[generated **553.8 million**]{.mark} DKK in revenue]{.underline} from
fisheries alone in 2023. [[Combined]{.mark} with GDP [growth]{.mark}
from **10.3 billion**]{.underline} DKK in 2003 [[to **20.3
billion**]{.underline}]{.mark} DKK in 2021, these
[developments]{.underline} have [played]{.underline} a [[**major role**
in **reducing**]{.mark} the block [grant's]{.mark}]{.underline} relative
[[**importance** in Greenland's economy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### L\-\--Mining\-\--2AC

#### Greenland mining doesn't generate enough economic support.

**Freedman '24** \[Leo; October 11; International Studies and
Ethnomusicology at the University of Washington, Seattle; URCEU,
"Assessing Paths to Greenlandic Independence: Reconciling Inuit Cultural
Autonomy with Danish Rule," 10.5642/urceu.WGHA1053\] //jwh

Despite this opportunity, [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} has [**not
acted** decisively]{.underline}. The [country [would
need]{.mark}]{.underline} to establish [[at least **20 major new
mining** projects]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [[to **generate** enough
**profit** to become **economically independent**]{.underline}]{.mark},
and the intensity of this endeavor would have substantial impacts on
Greenland's physical environment (Taagholt & Brooks, 2016). In addition,
greenhouse gasses produced by the combustion of fossil fuels anywhere in
the world are channeled to the Earth's poles via natural atmospheric
processes, causing particularly acute warming in the Arctic region
(Young, 2023). [[Although **investments** in the]{.mark} resource
**extraction** [industry may provide **short-term**]{.mark} economic
[gains, **Greenland** would be **digging its**]{.mark} **own
[grave]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Regardless of the dangers, Greenland's
natural resources do present an obvious opportunity for economic
development. The country is thus faced with a challenging decision: to
take advantage of natural resources in order to generate the economic
growth necessary to establish economic independence, or to forgo this
opportunity because of the real threats of climate change for
Greenland---one of the most vulnerable environments in the world and
home to a people whose culture is based on the reliable continuity of
conditions in the natural environment?

### L\-\--Mining\-\--1AR

#### Greenland's resource revenues are overstated\-\--Mining alone can't fund independence, entrenching long-term economic reliance on Danish subsidies.

**Euractiv '14** \[Euractiv; January 14; European news website focused

In a new report published on Friday (24 January), 13 [Nordic experts
**affirm**]{.underline} that the [[minerals]{.mark} found i[n Greenland
**won\'t** be enough to **grant** the country economic **independence**
from Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}.

According to the report, [[the **profits**]{.mark} Greenland can expect
from]{.underline} exploiting [its mines [have been **significantly

Denmark\'s]{.underline} annual [subsidy]{.underline} of 3.4 billion
Danish crowns (€457 million) [for at **least** another **25
years**]{.underline}.

During the past couple of years, the Greenlandic and Danish governments
have been discussing how the country can exploit its natural resources
such as uranium and possibly oil, something that could eventually lead
to the Arctic country\'s independence.

But according to the experts, [[Greenland would
need]{.underline}]{.mark} around [**[24 large-scale]{.mark}** mines
[costing]{.mark}]{.underline} around **[[€670 million
each]{.underline}]{.mark}** to match its current level of spending as a
welfare state. As [Greenland]{.underline} currently [**only** has
**two** mines]{.underline} and as commodity prices have fallen over the
past years, experts say [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"**[[unrealistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" that [[the country can
survive]{.mark} solely on its mines]{.underline}.

\"[There is **[nothing]{.mark}** that **[implies]{.mark}**]{.underline}

For NATO and the US, Greenland is important for several reasons. First,
[[Greenland is a part of **NATO**]{.mark} and [has]{.mark}]{.underline}
had [a [**defence agreement** with the US]{.mark}]{.underline}, through
Denmark, since 1951. Under this agreement, [the island [hosts the
**Pituffik Space Base**]{.mark}]{.underline} (formerly known as Thule
Air Base), [[a]{.mark} **critical** US [military installation that
supports]{.mark} **NATO**\'s [missile **defence**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and space surveillance systems. Modern military operations rely heavily
on polar-orbiting satellites for a range of activities, including
weather monitoring, communications, imaging, intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance, as well as exploring navigation alternatives to GPS.
Greenland\'s coordinates make it ideal for development and management of
those systems, and a wide range of space activities are undertaken by
the US and NATO at the Pituffik Space Base. Therefore, [the
base]{.underline} not only [[provides **early warning**
capabilities]{.mark} against]{.underline} potential [[missile
threats]{.underline}]{.mark} but also plays [an **[important]{.mark}**
role in monitoring space activities, **contributing** [to]{.mark}
NATO\'s]{.underline} overall [[**deterrence** and **defence**]{.mark}
posture]{.underline}. Second, [[Greenland is]{.mark} positioned [within
the]{.mark}]{.underline} Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom
(**[[GIUK]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[gap]{.underline}]{.mark}, an area of
the northern Atlantic Ocean [forming a **critical** passage for vessels
moving between the]{.underline} Atlantic [Ocean]{.underline} and the
Arctic, as well as between North America and Europe (see Figure 1).
[[**Controlling** this]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic transit route
[[allows NATO to **monitor**]{.mark} [and **regulate**]{.mark} maritime

As JD Vance touched down in Greenland, [the [Trump administration
received]{.mark} an **[unlikely endorsement]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
the US's first potential territorial expansion since 1947: [Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Speaking at an Arctic policy forum in the northern Russian city of
Murmansk on Thursday, Putin presented a more comprehensive case than any
US official yet for Donald Trump's plan to annex Greenland, crafting a
historical argument that sounded suspiciously convenient in terms of
Russia's own territorial designs on Ukraine.

The US's plans to take control of Greenland "may surprise someone only
at first glance, and [it is a deep mistake to believe]{.underline} that
[this is]{.underline} some kind of [extravagant talk by the new American
administration]{.underline}," [Putin began]{.underline}. "Nothing of the
sort."

The US had plans to buy Greenland in the 1960s but Congress would not
support the deal, Putin said. It "protected the territory from Nazi
occupation" in the 1940s and made an offer to buy the island that was
rebuffed. Even going back to 1910, the US had designs on Greenland,
[[the Russian leader]{.mark} [noted, calling the US plans]{.mark}
"serious" [with **"longstanding historical
roots"**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Then Putin moved on to Alaska, which was sold by the Russian empire to
the US in 1867 in what has become a national case of seller's remorse.
"Let me remind you that by 1868, the purchase of Alaska was ridiculed in
American newspapers," Putin continued. Now, he said, the purchase under
president Andrew Johnson had been vindicated.

In short, [[Putin concluded, **get over it**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Big
countries have territorial ambitions. Deals for land and annexations are
not just historical relics -- they are a modern reality. And, rejecting
generations of international norms not to take territory by force or
through extortion, it is none of our business what they do over there.

"[[As for Greenland]{.mark}, [this]{.mark}]{.underline} is an issue that
concerns two specific states and [[has nothing to do with
us]{.underline},"]{.mark} Putin said, while adding that [Russia
would]{.underline} continue to [defend its interests]{.underline} in the
Arctic f[rom "dangerous"]{.underline} powers such as [Finland and
Sweden]{.underline}.

The [[Russian President]{.mark}]{.underline} however, [[did not make

[\"Geopolitical competition in the Arctic region is intensifying,\"
President Putin said]{.underline}, giving Donald Trump\'s plan to take
over Greenland as a primary example of it.

Speaking about the significant shift in US foreign policy[, President
Putin said, \"America\'s plans in relation to Greenland are serious.
These plans have deep historical roots. And it is clear that the US will
continue to systematically pursue its geo-strategic, military,
political, and economic interests in the Arctic region.\"]{.underline}

Putin left Greenland to its fate.]{.mark} \"As for Greenland this is a

NUUK, Greenland----The Pentagon raised an alarm last year over what it
deemed a troubling development in this ice-cloaked territory: China was
looking to bankroll and build three airports that could give it a
military foothold off Canada's coast.

[[Greenland's p]{.mark}rime [m]{.mark}inister]{.underline} had flown to
Beijing in 2017 and [[**asked Chinese** state-run **banks** to
finance]{.underline}]{.mark} the [new commercial
[airports]{.mark}]{.underline}, including a big one for one of the
smallest capitals on earth, Nuuk, which can now be served only by
propeller planes. [The bankers were interested]{.underline}, people at
the meetings said, so long as a Chinese company constructed the
airports.

When [[word of the]{.underline}]{.mark} incipient [[offer
reached]{.mark} then-[U.S. Defense Secretary]{.mark} Jim
[Mattis]{.mark}]{.underline} early last year, he called on
Denmark---whose kingdom includes Greenland as a self-governing territory
but whose government had been reluctant to fund the airports.

[Beijing must not be allowed to militarize this stretch of the
Arctic]{.underline}, Mr. [Mattis told]{.underline} his Danish
counterpart Claus Frederiksen [at a meeting in Washington]{.underline}
in May, according to officials close to the discussion.

For years, [the [U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} and Europe [[had **generally
been spectators** to]{.mark} a]{.underline} global [[Chinese
building]{.mark} spree]{.underline}. To forge new global trade and
infrastructure links, Chinese banks have been financing hundreds of
projects, mostly built by Chinese companies, including roads, railways,
pipelines and power plants.

Western governments have been less willing to lend taxpayers' money for
risky infrastructure in distant lands. But that reluctance is ebbing as
the geopolitical fallout emerges from the financial difficulties several
countries face from Chinese infrastructure loans.

In one notable case, Sri Lanka, unable to service a Chinese loan,
granted a Chinese company a 99-year lease on a port close to key Indian
Ocean shipping lanes.

[[Alarmed,]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} is [joining with allies to offer
**alternative sources** of]{.mark} infrastructure
[financing]{.mark}.]{.underline} The sums involved are still dwarfed by
China's plans, but in July, the U.S., Japan and Australia announced a
partnership to invest in infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region. The
European Union unveiled similar plans in October.

Pentagon officials expressed worry that Greenland's aid-dependent
government could struggle to repay a loan for the \$555 million project,
and after a few missed payments, China's government could take control
of runways that could potentially be used by warplanes on an island
where the U.S. has a missile-tracking air force base. [A presence in
Greenland could also help China access new shipping lanes]{.underline}
and resources under the Arctic's retreating ice.

Months later, after the airports question precipitated a collapse of
this polar island's government and serial visits by U.S. and Danish
officials, Greenland announced that its new capital airport would be
built with loans backed by the Danish government, as would another 400
miles up the coast. Greenland will finance the third facility, and no
role for China is foreseen.

[In an unusual step]{.underline}, the [U.S. Defense]{.underline}
Department has [offered to chip in with airport
infrastructure]{.underline} that would help both civilian and military
or surveillance planes land on the country's coast.

Greenlandic officials say they hope the airports will open up one of the
world's most inaccessible places, allowing in affordable flights bearing
tourists, repatriates and immigrants.

[[U.S. officials see the episode]{.underline} [as]{.underline}]{.mark}
demonstrating one model for [[**countering China's** global
ambitions]{.mark}:]{.underline} calling on old allies to engage in
places where Beijing's ascent is challenging American power.

"When you have an issue like this arise, you see the strength of those
alliance relationships," a senior Defense Department official said.

The [[Chinese foreign ministry]{.underline}]{.mark} didn't respond to
requests for comment on the airport project but in a statement
[[said]{.mark} [China had **good relations** with Greenland]{.mark} and
Denmark]{.underline}, adding that it encouraged Chinese companies to
help Arctic development.

A former colony of Denmark, which granted it limited self-rule in 2009,
Greenland doesn't have roads between its cities. Residents move around
using a network of domestic airstrips and helipads that stretches back
to World War II.

Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen repeatedly turned down
requests to lend money for international airports on the island,
Greenlandic officials say. After last year's meeting between Mr. Mattis
and Denmark's defense minister, however, Mr. Rasmussen's government
rapidly pulled together a funding package that Greenlanders found
surprisingly favorable.

["He was **not into it** at all---until the Chinese showed
interest]{.underline}," said Aleqa Hammon, Greenland's former prime
minister, speaking of Mr. Rasmussen.

Mr. Rasmussen's office declined to comment.

Copenhagen's volte-face is a measure of how China's economic and
military rise is intensifying international competition over the Arctic,
especially Greenland, whose tiny government is slowly moving toward
independence from Denmark.

China declared itself a "near-Arctic state" last year, outlining plans
to carve new shipping routes through the region's melting ice and
exploit the natural resources underneath.

[Greenland is key to China's strategy,]{.underline} which it calls the
"Polar Silk Road."

China had wanted to buy an old maritime station abandoned by the Danish
defense as well, but that was "kind of vetoed by Washington," he noted.
Meanwhile, in 2019, the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC)
withdrew its bid to build two airports --- one in Nuuk and one in
Ilulissat --- for which Greenlandic politicians had initially shown
interest in seeking Chinese funds.

"[China was pushed out]{.underline} of these two cases . . . I heard
from reliable resources that [the [U.S. came up]{.mark} [with an idea to
make it]{.mark} quite [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}," Nielsen said.

Greenlandic efforts on soft diplomacy. "American diplomats in Nuuk
hardly want to answer hard questions about policy security. It's fairly
obvious that one of the reasons is [[to keep China out of

This sub-section attempts to look beyond the Danish-Greenlandic debate
and study China's interest in Greenland from a Chinese perspective.
[China's interests in the Arctic have been widely discussed]{.underline}
for almost a decade now. So far, [[China does]{.mark} [not have
a]{.mark} [publicly announced Arctic strategy]{.mark}]{.underline},
however. Focus in the study of China's interests in the Arctic in
general has been on the control over potential Arctic sea-routes, and on
the way in which, through various forms of diplomacy, [China is
attempting to maintain and **secure access** to the Arctic]{.underline},
an area characterized by relatively open international access, but with
the sovereignty of old great powers and close official or de facto US
allies (Bertelsen & Gallucci, 2016). Few studies focus more intensively
on China and Greenland (Mortensen, Su & Mouyal, 2016; Boersma & Foley,
2014; Sørensen, 2014; Têtu & Lasserre, 2017). Most of these studies
focus on resource politics and agree that China does have a state
interest in Greenland, but that this interest has been overestimated.

The most [[comprehensive study]{.underline}]{.mark} of the interests of
Chinese mining companies' in Greenland was conducted [[by Têtu
and]{.mark} [Lasserre]{.mark} (2017)]{.underline} and provided a
relatively complete survey of Chinese companies that at some point have
expressed an interest in Greenland's mineral resources. Their study
convincingly [[shows that]{.mark} potential [Chinese investors assess
Greenland to be **less attractive**]{.mark}]{.underline} [than
other]{.underline} potential [mining sites [due to lack of
infrastructure]{.mark},]{.underline} strict regulations, and cultural
barriers. However, their study includes neither Shenghe Resources nor
the Chinese authorities, which might have directed the interests of the
companies towards Greenland.

In this sub-section, I compare China's interests in Greenland with those
in other countries and territories.

In order to obtain an overview of China's relative interest in
Greenland, I have counted articles mentioning selected countries and
territories either in the Arctic and/or attracting large Chinese
resource investments in the very comprehensive CAJ database, which
contains purely scientific articles as well as reports presenting
background knowledge for policy makers. I assume that the interest in
Greenland was limited in 2004 and study the change in relative interest
since that year. [[Based on the proportion of articles mentioning

[[Senate Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} are [looking to [make the case
for U.S. interest in Greenland]{.mark} with a hearing [focused on the
Danish territory's mineral wealth and strategic
importance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [hearing called by [Commerce, Science and Transportation Chair Ted
Cruz]{.mark} (R-Texas)]{.underline} comes as President Donald Trump
insists the U.S. should own Greenland --- and he's not ruling out force
to take it.

The [committee will hear from a host of national security experts and
the executive of a mining company active in Cruz's home state of
Texas.]{.underline}

[Cruz in a statement [**emphasized** that **Greenland** has
"**enormous** economic benefits" for the U.S. given the island's
**massive** cache of minerals]{.mark} and [its location in the Arctic
as]{.mark} [threats from]{.mark} [China and Russia
grow]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"I believe [this hearing will show the [**growing** geopolitical
**importance** of Greenland]{.mark} and why [it is in the U.S.'s
**best** interest to **explore** potential opportunities for the
territory]{.mark}," the senator said.]{.underline}

[Greenland's]{.underline} vast resources [have come into sharper focus
as climbing temperatures melt some of the ice that covers much of the
the island.]{.underline}

Although [Trump\'s plan to acquire Greenland demonstrated his
unconventional approach to foreign policy]{.underline}, [[senators from
**both** parties embraced how]{.mark} his [attention to Greenland
reflected the **importance** of the Arctic to the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [for]{.mark} security reasons and a source of
[**natural** **resources**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Sen.]{.underline} Maria Cantwell[, D-Wash., stressed
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[**must** renew and recommit to an Arctic strategy]{.mark} that counters
its adversaries and promotes]{.underline} national
[security]{.underline}.

[\"[We are an Arctic nation, we have interests there]{.mark} and [we
need to continue to move forward]{.mark},\" Cantwell said.]{.underline}

Trump has repeatedly conveyed his interest in purchasing the territory,
citing its geopolitical value and rich natural resources.
[[Greenland\'s]{.mark} [**wealth** of minerals]{.mark}, which [remain
largely **untapped**]{.mark}, includes coal, gold, silver and a variety
of other rare earth metals.]{.underline}

[**Local** [officials]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, have [[**welcomed**
**increased** U.S. **investment** in **mining**]{.mark} in
particular]{.underline}. The island has recently stepped up its push for
independence from Denmark, which maintains some control over the island,
including its foreign policy.

On Monday, Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede said the island didn't
want to be American. However, Egede added that he wanted to pursue
deeper collaboration with the U.S. on defense, and [**welcomed** U.S.
investment [in **Greenland**]{.mark}**'s** mining
**industry**]{.underline}.

The share prices of [Greenland-focused]{.underline} mining
[[**companies** shot up in the **wake**]{.mark} of Trump's
remarks]{.underline}.

Mira Kleist , head of Greenland practice at advisory firm Kaya Partners,
said she had been [[fielding **increased** interest from **companies**
and **investors**]{.underline}]{.mark} in mining. She attributes the
interest to [[**geopolitical** developments]{.underline}]{.mark} and
advancing climate change, which could make it easier to operate as the
land becomes free from ice for longer parts of the year. The retreating
ice could also [[reveal **new**]{.mark} [mineral-**rich** areas]{.mark}
as it **exposes** bedrock]{.underline} that has lain icebound for
millennia.
