### Notes

This is a DA that says that the aff strengthens US leadership in the
arctic, which is bad because it crowds out China's ability to lead and
gain "soft power" (the ability to influence others to get the outcomes
one wants through attraction and persuasion rather than coercion or
punishment).

The goal is for this da to apply to almost every aff, but it is
certainly best against affs that claim to increase US
leadership/hegemony or help the US out-compete china.

You probably cannot read this da if you are also reading a da that has a
US heg good impact.

Opportunities for China"

Since the Cold War, a profound transformation in global politics has
transpired during President **[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration. His '**[America First' policy]{.underline}**,
**[characterized by diplomatic withdrawal, economic protectionism, and
skepticism towards multilateralism]{.underline}**, **[eroded established
alliances and [diminished America's status as a global
leader.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Under President Trump's administration, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is
prioritizing]{.mark} narrow [nationalism]{.mark} over international
cooperation]{.underline}**, as evidenced by the withdrawal from the
World Health Organization (WHO), the Paris Climate Accord, and closure
of USAID, the United States Agency for International Development.

On the other hand, **[[China seized the opportunity to]{.mark} position
itself as a global [lead]{.mark}er [and promote global
development]{.mark}, economic diplomacy, and
multilateralism]{.underline}**. Beijing has substantially augmented its
economic and geopolitical influence in recent years. **[[China may
occupy the gap created by America's exit]{.mark} from international
agreements and multilateralism]{.underline}** via the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), climate commitments, and strategic partnerships with
developing nations.

**[[Beijing is pursuing influence via soft power]{.mark}
mechanisms]{.underline}** such as trade agreements, development loans,
infrastructure investments, cultural initiatives, and educational
exchanges. On the contrary, the United States has historically
emphasized military alliances and economic sanctions.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China's most ambitious worldwide
investment endeavor, was launched in 2013 and encompasses over 150
countries, funding infrastructure projects including ports, roadways,
trains, and energy systems. Chinese-constructed initiatives have
benefited several nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
reinforcing Beijing's economic dominance in these regions. Despite
critics arguing that elevated interest rates and unclear loan conditions
may ensnare developing nations in prolonged dependency, China's loans
attract these countries due to their generally fewer restrictions than
those imposed by the IMF or World Bank.

During the COVID-19 epidemic, China used its 'Health Silk Road'
initiative to distribute millions of vaccination doses worldwide.
Despite skepticism regarding the vaccine's efficacy among certain
recipients, China's swift response strengthened relationships with
nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America---many of which received no
direct support from the U.S. throughout the crisis. China has enhanced
its standing as a benevolent economic partner by providing debt relief
to struggling economies such as Ethiopia, Zambia, and Pakistan.

When asked about the U.S exit from WHO, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Guo Jiakun emphasized the agency's "central and
coordinating role in global health governance." He added that, "China
will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,
deepening international cooperation in public health, strengthening
global health governance and promoting the building of a community of
human health".

Secondly, climate diplomacy is China's most persuasive assertion of
global leadership. Following Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement
and retracting U.S. environmental regulations, China promptly endeavored
to fill the leadership void.

China has significantly contributed to global decarbonization efforts,
being the foremost producer of solar panels, wind turbines, and
lithium-ion batteries. China has reinforced its dedication to
sustainability by augmenting green energy investments in developing
countries via the Belt and Road Initiative. China has pledged to achieve
carbon neutrality by 2060, signifying long-term environmental objectives
while being the largest carbon emitter globally. Nonetheless, given
China's continuous investment in coal-powered energy initiatives,
skepticism remains over the authenticity of these commitments.

Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jia kun reiterated
China's concern about the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. He
said that "Climate change is a common challenge facing all mankind...
"China's determination and actions to actively respond to climate change
are consistent." He added.

Moreover, **[the burgeoning strategic [cooperation between China and
Russia is a significant facet of its
rise]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[The Xi-Putin alliance has
recently strengthened due to their mutual antagonism to Western
hegemony.]{.underline}** The video meeting between Xi and Putin,
occurring within hours after Trump's inauguration, signaled a
coordinated challenge to the U.S.-led global order.

Their collaboration establishes the foundation of an emerging
China-Russia bloc, encompassing energy agreements, joint military
drills, and diplomatic support. Both nations reject the liberal
international system led by the United States and advocate for a
multipolar world order.

China's economic objectives include achieving global leadership in
technology. Beijing seeks to dominate critical areas such as
telecommunications, semiconductor production, and artificial
intelligence via its 'Made in China 2025' initiative.

China's technological advancement is spearheaded by Huawei and Alibaba,
challenging Western dominance in critical sectors. Beijing's strategic
focus on innovation and digital infrastructure is evident in the
advancement of 5G networks and government-funded quantum computing
research. Despite the United States' attempts to impede China's
technological progress, China's ongoing investments, despite trade
restrictions and penalties, demonstrate its dedication to leading the
fourth industrial revolution.

China's growing participation in international organizations signifies
its expanding power. China boosted its engagement with the World Trade
Organization (WTO), World Health Organization (WHO), and United Nations
(UN), while the Trump administration has withdrawn from international
organizations.

Beijing has contested Western-dominated frameworks and advocates for
alternative governance models. China's status as a significant global
financial power has been further reinforced by the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB), a China-led alternative to the World Bank.
Beijing's enduring objective of reshaping the global order, to align
with its interests, is underscored by its diplomatic strategy.

Moreover, **[[China's Arctic expansion signifies a substantial shift in
geopolitics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Beijing has declared itself a
'near-Arctic state'. It has invested in infrastructure projects in
Greenland and Russia, prompted by the emergence of new trade routes
resulting from melting ice caps. [**[China has]{.underline}**
**[strategically prioritized the Arctic]{.underline}** **[to
dominate]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[vital [transportation]{.mark} routes
[and]{.mark} exploit untapped [resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
increasing influence of China in the region continues to alarm the
United States and its allies, who perceive it as advancing Beijing's
broader geopolitical objectives.

**[[A retreat of]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration [from global
leadership may allow China to increase its influence]{.mark} through
multilateral cooperation, economic diplomacy, climate commitment and
technological investments.]{.underline}**

While it remains uncertain whether the United States can regain its
leadership status, **[[Beijing is currently betting that actions have a
greater impact than rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**, regardless of its
deliberations. **[[China's rise to dominance, as a preeminent global
force, appears increasingly secure as the world realigns its alliances
and partnerships.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Key to [regime legitimacy]{.underline}. 

**Edney 15**, Lecturer in Politics and International Relations of China
in the School of Politics and International Studies at the University of
Leeds. (Kingsley, "Building National Cohesion and Domestic Legitimacy: A
Regime Security Approach to Soft Power in China," *Politics*, 25.3-4)

The need to overcome the security dilemma by reducing the fear its rise
provokes in others is one of China\'s most complex national security
challenges and the most widely cited reason for the country wanting to
increase its soft power. According to Li (2009, p. 31), **[[soft power
is]{.mark} 'primarily [utilized to refute the "China threat"]{.mark}
thesis]{.underline}**, facilitate a better understanding of China\'s
domestic socio-economic reality, **[[and persuade]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
outside [world to]{.mark} accept and [support China\'s
rise']{.mark}]{.underline}**. Deng (2009, p. 64) argues that **[in
China]{.underline}** the concept of **[[soft
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** 'to a large extent, **[[means]{.mark} the
ability to influence others in world politics with the goal of achieving
[great power status]{.mark} [without sparking]{.mark} fully fledged
traditional power politics of hostile [balancing or
war]{.mark}'.]{.underline}** In his analysis of the concept\'s role in
China\'s rise, **[Ding]{.underline}** (2010, p. 266) **[argues that the
country\'s soft power strategy is one of reassurance that helps 'to deal
with foreign challenges and create a friendly international
environment']{.underline}**. Rawnsley (2012, p. 126) notes that China\'s
soft power strategy has been prompted by the emergence of a 'China
threat' discourse in the West and therefore China\'s soft power can be
seen as 'not only reactive, but defensive'. Nye also claims that its
soft power strategy is intended 'to make its hard power look less
threatening to its neighbors' and that soft power can help to reduce the
effectiveness of regional coalitions that attempt to balance against
China (Nye, 2011, p. 23; 2013). This kind of national security
perspective helps explain why building soft power has become such an
important task for the CCP. But we need to consider the possibility that
**[domestic [concerns over regime security]{.mark} are]{.underline}**
also **[[driv]{.mark}ing [China\'s soft power]{.mark}
project.]{.underline}**

'Regime security' generally refers to 'the condition where governing
elites are secure from violent challenges to their rule' (Jackson, 2010,
p. 187). In China\'s case, however, the insecurity of the regime is
generated by the possibility not only of violent challenges, but also of
'peaceful evolution' (heping yanbian), which is an extremely seriously
concern for the CCP, particularly following the 'color revolutions' that
have occurred in some post-Soviet states (see Shambaugh, 2008, pp.
88--89). The 'regime' can be defined as 'the small state of persons who
hold the highest offices ... and/or are the elite that effectively
command the machinery, especially the coercive forces, of the state'
(Job, 1992, p. 15). While this article uses the term 'regime security'
rather than 'state security', it should be noted that there is often no
clear dividing line between the two within a 'state-embedded polity'
(Gilley, 2006, p. 501) such as China, where there is significant
penetration of the state by the CCP. Despite China\'s successes in
dealing with many of the common sources of insecurity for developing
states, such as permeability by external actors and susceptibility to
armed conflict (see Ayoob, 1995, p. 15), **[two important sources of
regime insecurity remain problematic for the authorities: lack of
legitimacy and lack of national cohesion.]{.underline}**

For a political authority such as the CCP, **[legitimacy is determined
by the degree to which it 'holds and exercises political power with
legality, justification and consent from the standpoint of all of its
citizens']{.underline}** (Gilley, 2009, p. 11). In other words, the use
of power must proceed according to rules, these rules are justified by
widely shared beliefs and the actions of those in subordinate positions
provide evidence that they consent to the power relationship (Beetham,
1991, p. 16). There has been a great deal of elite discussion of party
legitimacy in China, particularly since the early 2000s; one study
showed that 68 per cent of sampled Chinese journal articles about
legitimacy took the view that the CCP\'s legitimacy was under threat,
while 30 per cent claimed the party faced a legitimacy crisis (Gilley
and Holbig, 2009, p. 343). A more recent study found that Chinese
intellectuals are more pessimistic about regime legitimacy in China than
their Western counterparts (Zeng, 2014). For the purpose of this article
it is not necessary to resolve the question of whether or not the CCP
currently faces a legitimacy crisis, however -- only to show that **[the
potential for the party-state to lose its legitimacy is a serious source
of insecurity.]{.underline}**

The Fourth Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, held in October 2014,
provides clear evidence that senior party officials are highly concerned
about the legality of CCP power. The Plenum\'s major focus was the need
for the party to 'rule according to the law' (yi fa zhi guo) and pointed
out that 'good law is a prerequisite for good governance' and that for
the party to rule according to the law it must first rule according to
the constitution (Xinhua, 2014). Responsibility for the justification of
party power falls on the Central Propaganda Department, which utilizes a
comprehensive network of institutions to attempt to reproduce the
official discourse justifying CCP rule and suppress any rival discourses
that might challenge it (see Edney, 2014). Lack of consent is also a
problem that requires significant resources to overcome. According to
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in recent years the annual
number of major protests in China has exceeded 100,000 (Huang, 2012).
While all states use domestic force to some extent (see Buzan, 1983, p.
67), the huge investment of the Chinese authorities in the internal
security apparatus, which in recent years has exceeded even China\'s
military spending (Martina, 2014), demonstrates that the lack of consent
to CCP rule is widespread enough to be a cause for serious concern.

**[[Soft power]{.mark} is primarily relevant to the [enhance]{.mark}ment
of [regime legitimacy]{.mark} where a significant component of
[the]{.mark} moral [justification]{.mark} for maintaining the current
system [is based on the regime\'s ability to improve]{.mark} the
international [status]{.mark} of the national unit. [The]{.mark}
international [increase in]{.mark} positive attraction that is
associated with a rise in [soft power makes it easier]{.mark} for the
regime [to convince]{.mark} its [citizens of]{.mark} the truth of its
claim that [the country\'s]{.mark} international [status is improving
under its leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where 'status' is defined
not only in terms of material capabilities, but also in terms of social
recognition. For the most part, **[evidence of an increase in
international recognition and attraction]{.underline}** could be **[used
to bolster claims that the regime has successfully improved the
country\'s international status]{.underline}**, regardless of whether
soft power is a result of attraction to political values, culture or
foreign policies, or whether it is generated by the policies of the
regime or sources within broader society. Some internationally
attractive cultural products can also be the work of dissidents or
relate to aspects of culture or values that the regime would rather
suppress, however, and these sources of attraction are difficult for the
authorities to exploit.

Chinese political elites feel a keen sense of obligation to restore the
country\'s past great power status (Deng, 2008, pp. 8--9) and show its
people that China is globally respected and admired (Zhang, 2012, p.
620). The leadership attempts to appease domestic nationalist audiences
by gaining 'face' for China abroad (Gries, 2004, pp. 120--121) and the
party-state has often publicized statements of support or admiration
from foreign allies to demonstrate China\'s international status and
thereby bolster its moral claim to rule (e.g. Brady, 2003, p. 228). If
there is a broad-based growth in Chinese soft power, these statements
are likely to become more common and more credible as the number and
variety of foreign actors who are attracted to China increases.
Moreover, **[[international attraction]{.mark} to China\'s success in
areas such as economic development [expands]{.mark} the number of
'nodes' in networks of '[legitimacy]{.mark} belief', thereby reducing
the marginal cost of persuasion and [squeezing out
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}** discourse**[[s]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
might [challenge]{.mark} regime [legitimacy]{.mark}
(]{.underline}**Gerschewski, 2013, pp. 26--27). **[This makes it easier
for the CCP to claim legitimacy based on its success in moving China
toward the shared goal of national 'rejuvenation'.]{.underline}**

Although 'national cohesion' is a concept that is rather nebulous and
difficult to assess, the regular references to 'cohesion' in official
CCP statements indicate that Chinese leaders are worried about it and
seek to improve it (e.g. CCP Central Committee, 2011; 2013). As China
has become a more plural society, generating social consensus (ningju
gongshi) and unifying the people (ningju renxin) have become serious
concerns for the propaganda authorities (Edney, 2014). According to
propaganda chief Liu Yunshan, achieving the 'China dream' of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires cultural cohesion (Xinhua,
2013), while an early article on national cultural security published on
a CCP website argues that **[[if a country lacks cohesion]{.mark} --
even if it is strong in terms of other forms of power -- when it faces
challenges]{.underline}** such as a natural disaster or foreign invasion
**[[it]{.mark} [will 'collapse at the first blow']{.mark}]{.underline}**
(bu kan yi ji) (Yang, 2006). A lack of national cohesion can be a
persistent problem for weak states that are unable to generate 'a
domestic political and social consensus of sufficient strength to
eliminate the large-scale use of force as a major and continuing element
in the domestic political life of the nation' (Buzan, 1983, p. 67).

Normally soft power refers to a country\'s attractiveness to foreign
constituencies. To consider the possibility that it could enhance
national cohesion, however, it is necessary to apply the concept to the
relationship between domestic constituencies. In this sense, the soft
power of the political, social and cultural core of the polity
encourages domestic interest groups and individuals on the margins to
want the same outcomes, such as stability and national cohesion, as the
authorities at the center. Although this might seem to be a major step
away from the traditional interpretation of soft power, Nye\'s (2011,
pp. 19--20) argument that soft power is a key requirement of an
effective counter-insurgency strategy and that dealing with the threat
of terrorism requires the soft power of an appealing narrative that can
win over mainstream society and prevent terrorists recruiting new
members to their groups, highlights the concept\'s potential
significance for state efforts to respond to domestic sources of
instability. In this case, **[soft power involves enhancing regime
security by making it less likely that domestic adversaries who pose a
threat to national cohesion will be able to obtain material support from
the local population, which then makes it easier for the state to deal
with the security threat they pose.]{.underline}**

**[The authorities in Beijing face a range of threats to national
cohesion from peripheral regions, including]{.underline}** the ongoing
problem of **[terrorism and insurgent attacks in
Xinjiang]{.underline}**, protests and discontent in Tibet, pro-democracy
protests in Hong Kong and de facto independence in Taiwan. In light of
these challenges it would not be unreasonable for scholars, or even the
authorities, to interpret '**[[soft power']{.underline}]{.mark}** as
something that could also be applied to **[[improve regime security by
enhancing the cohesion between the]{.mark} political, social and
cultural [core of the Chinese polity and those on the
margins]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, in more general terms, Wang and
Lu (2008, p. 427) have pointed out that Chinese interpretations of soft
power include 'the ability to generate compliance in a society by moral
example and persuasion'.

#### Legitimacy shortfalls cause China to attack Taiwan.

Communist Party\'s Legitimacy,\" American Enterprise Institute,

Yet **[[for the CCP]{.mark}, external [aggression
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** a **[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** tool
**[[to combat internal weakness. The CCP is obsessed
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[fragilities, such as [the threat of
losing]{.mark} popular support and [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and demands for more justice and freedoms. When Chinese people criticize
their government, China must act more aggressively abroad. **[[Beijing
uses external aggression to fan]{.mark} Chinese
[nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and cast the CCP as the protector of
the people and champion of a new era of Chinese glory.

**[Corona]{.underline}**virus was a true moment of weakness for the CCP,
as it **[exposed fissures in China's]{.underline}** overcentralized
authoritarian **[political system]{.underline}** to light. A
now-infamous example of Chinese paranoia over potentially out-of-control
domestic crises was the case of Dr. Li Wenliang. On February 7, Li, a
doctor who warned of the coronavirus but was quickly censored by the
Wuhan police, died from the virus himself. Li's death quickly became the
top trending topic on Chinese social media with hashtags such as "We
want freedom of speech." The CCP censored all mentions of Li or any
coronavirus failings, fearing more organized protests. Simultaneously,
the coronavirus battered China's economic growth, which underpins the
CCP's claim to legitimacy, with an unprecedented 6.8 percent Q1
contraction.

Far from the unified front which Beijing seeks to project, the
coronavirus revealed the CCP's dysfunction. For example, Dali, a midsize
city, intercepted and distributed a shipment of surgical masks headed to
the hard-hit municipality of Chongqing. Similarly, the City of Qingdao
instructed customs officials to hold on to a shipment of masks and
medical products headed to Shenyang. At the same time, Hong Kong dealt
the CCP a major political embarrassment when it halted traffic coming in
from the mainland. These reports demonstrate the government's inability
to enforce basic order among competing cities and provinces.

**[[In response to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the tumult caused by the
**[[corona]{.underline}]{.mark}**virus crisis, **[[the CCP
mobilized]{.mark} popular [support by reigniting conflicts with]{.mark}
its neighbors]{.underline}**. On April 2, during the peak of the
coronavirus, a Chinese maritime security vessel sank a
**[[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}**ese fishing boat near the Parcel
islands. Just two weeks later on April 16, China escalated a month's
long standoff with **[[Malaysia]{.underline}]{.mark}** by deploying the
coast guard to a disputed oil shelf. China also stepped up its military
activities targeting **[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**---who's
coronavirus response was strong and effective---with as many as three
incursions in a single week in June. These episodes were widely
condemned by the international community, but greeted with nationalist
revelry at home.

The need to project strength and unity domestically explains the timing
of China's border dispute with India. In May, violent brawls broke out
between Chinese and Indian soldiers near Sikkim. On June 15, the Indian
government reported that twenty Indian soldiers were killed by Chinese
soldiers in the Galwan River Valley, a disputed border region controlled
by India but claimed by China.

The CCP has made full use of the crisis to rally nationalism. China's
foreign ministry issued statements blaming India for the clashes and
state-propaganda popularized the slogan "China is not afraid." The
Global Times, a propaganda outlet, cast the clashes as an Indian
invasion, saying "India has illegally constructed defense facilities
across the border into Chinese territory in the Galwan Valley region."
Importantly, Chinese state-owned news outlets were also running news
about India's poor coronavirus response at the time, in contrast to its
own "successes."

The recent border clashes mirror China's 2017 standoff with India at
Doklam, a strategic point near Bhutan. During the conflict, Foreign
Minister Wang Yi made statements that cast the conflict as an Indian
attack upon China, and state media circulated images from the 1962
Sino-Indian War, to remind the China populace that Beijing had defeated
Delhi before. The India clashes coincided with another threat to CCP
legitimacy: a fight to remove pro-democracy advocates from the Hong Kong
Legislative Council. China ended up harshly cracking down on the
supposedly autonomous city as well.

Understanding China's weaknesses is essential for policymakers
attempting to make sense of its aggression. This dynamic is not only a
Xi Jinping phenomenon: **[China's modern history shows that domestic
crises are often followed by belligerence]{.underline}**. A study that
pre-dated Xi's rule, with **[[a dataset of over three thousand
interactions]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the United States and China,
**[[found]{.mark} that [the CCP was twice as likely to initiate disputes
when the]{.mark}]{.underline}** Shanghai Stock Exchange
(**[[SSE]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[experienced a]{.mark} substantial
[drop. The SSE is a barometer of elite sentiment]{.mark} in China
[because the government]{.mark} pledges to protect elite investments and
[uses]{.mark} SSE [listings to reward]{.mark} party
[insiders]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Insight into the CCP's domestic political objectives helps determine the
magnitude of the conflict and appropriate response. The editor of the
Global Times wrote that a belligerent foreign policy was "necessary to
satisfy the Chinese people." Policymakers can use history to deduce what
levels of aggression are "necessary" for the CCP's goals**[. In India,
it is unlikely that clashes will escalate into invasion because the
current skirmishes satisfy the CCP's purpose of bolstering
legitimacy]{.underline}**.

However, **[[Taiwan may be in]{.mark} particular [danger]{.mark} from
China's reactionary aggression]{.underline}**. This is because the ways
in which **[[conflict]{.mark} with Taiwan [would]{.mark} bolster the
[CCP]{.mark}'s [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** align more closely
with more violent coercion---**[[reunification is a core element of the
CCP's platform]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Taiwan's clear success
fighting the coronavirus is a major blow to Beijing's legitimacy.
Because Taiwan's "threat" to the CCP stems from its mere existence, it
is particularly vulnerable to reactionary aggression. Xi is a
self-proclaimed follower of Mao. So, the 1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis is a
powerful example; Mao needed to generate support for the great leap
forward and deflect criticism from poor economic growth. To stir the
nation, Mao seized islands controlled by Taiwan and threatened an
invasion of the country until restrained by American nuclear
brinksmanship.

could go nuclear several times in the past: in 1954-55, 1958, and 1996.
Now, they **[seem to be living on that edge permanently]{.underline}**.

In recent years, China's policy has alienated Taiwan completely. As
China has bullied, threatened, and displayed force at home and abroad,
it has made unification unacceptable to much of the Taiwanese
electorate. And it has enjoyed only mixed success in trying to isolate
Taiwan diplomatically. It has managed to buy off many of Taiwan's
erstwhile allies, but its conduct over COVID-19 and support for Russia
despite the invasion of Ukraine have cost it friends, too---and those
former friends have turned to the island across the strait.

Since at least 2021, Taiwan has had a seemingly endless parade of
visitors, from Germany's education minister to Liz Truss, the former
U.K. prime minister. In November 2021, the European Parliament sent its
first official delegation to the island; the head of the delegation,
Raphaël Glucksmann, told Tsai, "We in Europe are also confronted with
interference from authoritarian regimes and we came here to learn from
you." In October 2022, Tsai received lawmakers from Lithuania and
Ukraine; the former had recently established a representative office in
Taiwan despite Beijing's anger, while the latter was making a gesture of
solidarity with a country that, unlike China, had been sharp in its
criticism of Moscow. A Japanese parliamentary delegation that arrived in
December 2022 spoke glowingly of Tsai's defense plans and emphasized
Japan's own determination to keep the status quo in the region from
being "changed by force or unilaterally." China has warned against or
condemned many of these visits.

Beijing has only itself to blame for Taiwan's strengthened diplomatic
position. Its wolf warrior nationalism and reluctance to break with
Moscow have cost it European support. If visits from foreign politicians
were to translate into condemnation of China at the United Nations,
Beijing could veto a Security Council resolution. In this case, like
Russia, China would find itself a pariah state---and unlike Russia,
China cares about how it is seen by the world. China's own corrosive
nationalism has eaten into its body politic, too. It has not torn itself
apart in a bout of political bloodletting, but it has certainly let
loose the kind of jingoism that would allow that to happen. What it will
decide to do in a crisis is uncertain. Beijing itself does not know.

The United States, meanwhile, seems intent on reviving a defense treaty
with Taipei that it once spent more than a decade trying to break.
Taiwan has become a means of showing China just how tough the United
States can get. Washington is not clear on how getting tough will alter
Beijing's conduct, but "deterrence" is the concept invoked most often. A
show of force, the thinking goes, will deter China from aggression. But
what if deterrence fails? What if the show of force backs China into a
corner from which it feels it has no option but to lash out? To this,
Washington has few answers beyond preparing for war.

Some **[U.S.]{.underline}** pundits have waxed lyrical about how they
would fight a war with China. Taiwan, they opined, will be turned into a
"porcupine" with hardened defenses. One former defense official
suggested the use of "low-yield tactical nuclear weapons" in the event
of a conflict with China. (The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
qualify as low yield.) The possibility of Russian President Vladimir
Putin using such weapons sent shock waves of horror through the world,
but the idea of employing them in a **[war with China]{.underline}**
became normal in some circles. There was no guarantee that, once the
nuclear taboo was breached, the weapons would stay "low yield." But the
question of what would happen if the two powers escalated to
higher-yield arms and **[plunge]{.underline}**d **[the world into
nuclear holocaust]{.underline}** has been left unresolved.

It is as though the United States is being haunted by all the ghosts of
its long past with China and Taiwan, forcing it to relive questions it
had once thought resolved. U.S. military leader Douglas MacArthur wanted
to wage war against China in 1950. President Dwight D. Eisenhower
considered using nuclear weapons against China in 1955 and 1958. Today,
Washington abides by the "One China" principle, but it wants Taiwan to
enjoy "self-determination." It vows that it does not dispute the
formulation that Taiwan is a part of China, but it will help Taiwan
resist Chinese coercion. It wishes to promote Taiwan's presence in
international organizations, but it remains unwilling to recognize
Taiwan itself. The United States has shifted from pure ambiguity to
ambiguity with a tilt in favor of Taiwan---and it has done so because it
decided China is an enemy.

Like China, the United States is mired in jingoism and confusion. Like
China, it has no idea what it would do if things go wrong. With the 2024
U.S. presidential election heating up, the one thing every candidate,
Democrat or Republican, has done is to show how tough they could get on
China. Republicans vying for the nomination got in on the act early;
former President Donald Trump has denounced French President Emmanuel
Macron for "kissing Xi's ass," referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Joe Biden, with the power of the incumbent, has not stopped at rhetoric.
Whether supporting a TikTok ban unless the app is sold or calling for
increased tariffs on Chinese goods, his policies are calibrated to
demonstrate toughness on China.

Taiwan's own presidential elections, held on Jan. 13, showed just how
deeply the island's electorate had turned against unification. At first,
William Lai, the candidate from Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), vowed not to alter the status quo, though he accused Beijing of
doing so. Taiwan, he argued, was already sovereign. There was no need to
change what worked. But his caution soon vanished. While campaigning,
Lai defined success for Taiwan as its leaders being able to visit the
White House. This was a gauntlet thrown down---Taiwanese officials are
blocked from visiting Washington. The Biden administration immediately
demanded an explanation. This was not, U.S. officials made clear, how
the relationship worked. Where Tsai had been prudent, Lai was willing to
push his luck.

The Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, was not leaning toward
Beijing, either. Its nominee, Hou You-yi, the mayor of New Taipei City,
said that he would reject both "one country, two systems" and a formal
move for independence, but that if Taiwan were attacked, he would face
the challenge. Taiwan, according to Hou, needed to be ready to defend
itself. On the crucial question of how to deal with China, there was
little difference between the policies Lai and Hou espoused.

A third candidate, Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People's Party, was
calculatedly vague on China policy. His campaign made clear that he was
depending on votes from traditional KMT supporters: those who would have
favored a closer relationship with China. He claimed that he would find
the middle ground between the KMT's appeasement of China and the DPP's
provocation of it; he would make Taiwan a bridge for Sino-American
communication rather than a front in a Sino-American war. How he
proposed to do all this was left undefined.

Lai eventually won the presidency, but it was not the ringing triumph
Tsai had won four years earlier. Lai scraped through with a mere 40
percent of the vote, his victory made easier by the fact that Hou and Ko
had failed to join forces. As he prepares to take office on May 20, Lai
faces a deeply divided, volatile populace and a legislature in which the
DPP is bereft of a majority.

This is a point China has been quick to underline. The DPP, it huffed
after the election, is not representative of "majority public opinion."
What is lost on Beijing is that the other candidates made clear that
unification was not something they were willing to countenance either.
Hou had made a point of not inviting Ma Ying-jeou, the last KMT member
to serve as Taiwan's president, to his rallies; he knew that to
associate himself with Ma's embrace of China would have doomed his
candidacy. Beijing still does not understand Taiwan. Meanwhile, the
United States continues to disavow support for Taiwanese independence
while making plans for further delegations to the island. With the U.S.
presidential election going into fifth gear, the risk of miscalculation
will only rise.

**[[At the edge of chaos, a single choice can make the difference
between order and catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More than 80 years
on from the Cairo Declaration, which held that Taiwan would be "restored
to the Republic of China" at the end of World War II, we can see that
there were myriad moments that could have yielded different outcomes,
for better or for worse. If President Franklin D. Roosevelt had insisted
on self-determination for Taiwan after World War II, if the Korean War
had not happened, if Beijing had made "one country, two systems" work,
if Taiwan had developed a nuclear weapon, if Pelosi's plane had indeed
been shot at---if someone had made a different decision at any of those
moments, the world would be a radically different place.

**[[When deterrence]{.mark}, toughness, [and pride drive policy, the
room for error diminishes to]{.mark} virtually
[nil]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[China, Taiwan, and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [are at a point where the choices they make could spell
the difference between peace and nuclear]{.mark}
\[[devastation]{.mark}\] holocaust]{.underline}**. Those choices are
best made with the historical record---and all its unrealized
possibilities---firmly in mind.

### China DA---Climate---1NC

#### China will fill the leadership gap created by US withdrawal, but US commitment to the arctic [crowds out]{.underline} Chinese soft power

**Karim 25**, Postdoctoral fellow at Yunnan Minzu University (Ejaz,
2-10-2025, "The Vacuum in Global Leadership in the Trump Era and
Opportunities for China"
https://www.wgi.world/the-vacuum-in-global-leadership-in-the-trump-era-and-opportunities-for-china/)
wtk

Since the Cold War, a profound transformation in global politics has
transpired during President **[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration. His '**[America First' policy]{.underline}**,
**[characterized by diplomatic withdrawal, economic protectionism, and
skepticism towards multilateralism]{.underline}**, **[eroded established
alliances and [diminished America's status as a global
leader.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Under President Trump's administration, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is
prioritizing]{.mark} narrow [nationalism]{.mark} over international
cooperation]{.underline}**, as evidenced by the withdrawal from the
World Health Organization (WHO), the Paris Climate Accord, and closure
of USAID, the United States Agency for International Development.

On the other hand, **[[China seized the opportunity to]{.mark} position
itself as a global [lead]{.mark}er [and promote global
development]{.mark}, economic diplomacy, and
multilateralism]{.underline}**. Beijing has substantially augmented its
economic and geopolitical influence in recent years. **[[China may
occupy the gap created by America's exit]{.mark} from international
agreements and multilateralism]{.underline}** via the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), climate commitments, and strategic partnerships with
developing nations.

**[[Beijing is pursuing influence via soft power]{.mark}
mechanisms]{.underline}** such as trade agreements, development loans,
infrastructure investments, cultural initiatives, and educational
exchanges. On the contrary, the United States has historically
emphasized military alliances and economic sanctions.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China's most ambitious worldwide
investment endeavor, was launched in 2013 and encompasses over 150
countries, funding infrastructure projects including ports, roadways,
trains, and energy systems. Chinese-constructed initiatives have
benefited several nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
reinforcing Beijing's economic dominance in these regions. Despite
critics arguing that elevated interest rates and unclear loan conditions
may ensnare developing nations in prolonged dependency, China's loans
attract these countries due to their generally fewer restrictions than
those imposed by the IMF or World Bank.

During the COVID-19 epidemic, China used its 'Health Silk Road'
initiative to distribute millions of vaccination doses worldwide.
Despite skepticism regarding the vaccine's efficacy among certain
recipients, China's swift response strengthened relationships with
nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America---many of which received no
direct support from the U.S. throughout the crisis. China has enhanced
its standing as a benevolent economic partner by providing debt relief
to struggling economies such as Ethiopia, Zambia, and Pakistan.

When asked about the U.S exit from WHO, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Guo Jiakun emphasized the agency's "central and
coordinating role in global health governance." He added that, "China
will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,
deepening international cooperation in public health, strengthening
global health governance and promoting the building of a community of
human health".

Secondly, climate diplomacy is China's most persuasive assertion of
global leadership. Following Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement
and retracting U.S. environmental regulations, China promptly endeavored
to fill the leadership void.

China has significantly contributed to global decarbonization efforts,
being the foremost producer of solar panels, wind turbines, and
lithium-ion batteries. China has reinforced its dedication to
sustainability by augmenting green energy investments in developing
countries via the Belt and Road Initiative. China has pledged to achieve
carbon neutrality by 2060, signifying long-term environmental objectives
while being the largest carbon emitter globally. Nonetheless, given
China's continuous investment in coal-powered energy initiatives,
skepticism remains over the authenticity of these commitments.

Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jia kun reiterated
China's concern about the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. He
said that "Climate change is a common challenge facing all mankind...
"China's determination and actions to actively respond to climate change
are consistent." He added.

Moreover, **[the burgeoning strategic [cooperation between China and
Russia is a significant facet of its
rise]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[The Xi-Putin alliance has
recently strengthened due to their mutual antagonism to Western
hegemony.]{.underline}** The video meeting between Xi and Putin,
occurring within hours after Trump's inauguration, signaled a
coordinated challenge to the U.S.-led global order.

Their collaboration establishes the foundation of an emerging
China-Russia bloc, encompassing energy agreements, joint military
drills, and diplomatic support. Both nations reject the liberal
international system led by the United States and advocate for a
multipolar world order.

China's economic objectives include achieving global leadership in
technology. Beijing seeks to dominate critical areas such as
telecommunications, semiconductor production, and artificial
intelligence via its 'Made in China 2025' initiative.

China's technological advancement is spearheaded by Huawei and Alibaba,
challenging Western dominance in critical sectors. Beijing's strategic
focus on innovation and digital infrastructure is evident in the
advancement of 5G networks and government-funded quantum computing
research. Despite the United States' attempts to impede China's
technological progress, China's ongoing investments, despite trade
restrictions and penalties, demonstrate its dedication to leading the
fourth industrial revolution.

China's growing participation in international organizations signifies
its expanding power. China boosted its engagement with the World Trade
Organization (WTO), World Health Organization (WHO), and United Nations
(UN), while the Trump administration has withdrawn from international
organizations.

Beijing has contested Western-dominated frameworks and advocates for
alternative governance models. China's status as a significant global
financial power has been further reinforced by the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB), a China-led alternative to the World Bank.
Beijing's enduring objective of reshaping the global order, to align
with its interests, is underscored by its diplomatic strategy.

Moreover, **[[China's Arctic expansion signifies a substantial shift in
geopolitics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Beijing has declared itself a
'near-Arctic state'. It has invested in infrastructure projects in
Greenland and Russia, prompted by the emergence of new trade routes
resulting from melting ice caps. [**[China has]{.underline}**
**[strategically prioritized the Arctic]{.underline}** **[to
dominate]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[vital [transportation]{.mark} routes
[and]{.mark} exploit untapped [resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
increasing influence of China in the region continues to alarm the
United States and its allies, who perceive it as advancing Beijing's
broader geopolitical objectives.

**[[A retreat of]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration [from global
leadership may allow China to increase its influence]{.mark} through
multilateral cooperation, economic diplomacy, climate commitment and
technological investments.]{.underline}**

While it remains uncertain whether the United States can regain its
leadership status, **[[Beijing is currently betting that actions have a
greater impact than rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**, regardless of its
deliberations. **[[China's rise to dominance, as a preeminent global
force, appears increasingly secure as the world realigns its alliances
and partnerships.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Chinese leadership is key to [global climate mitigation]{.underline}

**Hare** 11-6-20**24**, physicist and climate scientist, is the chief
executive of Climate Analytics (Bill, "Donald Trump can't stop global
climate action. If we stick together, it's the US that will lose out,"
The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/07/donald-trump-cant-stop-global-climate-action-if-we-stick-together-its-the-us-that-will-lose-out)

Donald **[[Trump's re-election]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the White House
**[[is a]{.mark} major [setback for climate]{.mark} action [but]{.mark}
ultimately [it's the US that could end up losing out]{.mark}, as [the
rest of the world will move forward without it]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The US is the world's biggest economy and its second biggest emitter.
Positive US engagement on climate has been crucial to landmark leaps
forward, like getting the Paris agreement over the line, and just last
year committing to transitioning away from fossil fuels.

The US missing in action in the latter half of this critical decade for
climate action is nobody's idea of a good outcome.

President-elect Trump has promised to leave the Paris agreement and
reports have emerged that he could be thinking of pulling out of the
underlying United Nations framework treaty on climate change. But we've
been here before and the truth is that a second
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** presidency **[[can't stop]{.mark}
[climate action]{.mark}]{.underline}**, just like his denial of
human-induced climate change won't spare the US from its impacts.

**[[The energy transition is]{.mark} now well [under way. The economics
of renewable]{.mark} technologie[s are]{.mark} so [attractive]{.mark}
that they have become an energy juggernaut]{.underline}**. Since the
Paris agreement was signed in 2015, global investment in clean energy
has increased by 60%.

Nearly US\$2tn a year is now invested in clean energy projects, almost
double that spent on new oil, gas and coal supply. Before the pandemic,
this ratio was closer to 1:1. The US added 560 gigawatts of renewable
capacity in 2023. That's about six times the size of Australia's entire
electricity capacity, added in just one year.

Domestically, Joe Biden's **[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nflation
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**eduction **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct has
**[[set wheels in motion for climate investment that will be]{.mark}
hard, and politically [unpopular, to
undo]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Famously, no Republicans voted for
the legislation but red states have been the main beneficiaries of the
money, projects and jobs it has created. House Republicans have even
pushed back against their peers to protect some of the act's clean
energy tax credits.

Climate impacts are accelerating in pace and scale that is untenable to
ignore. Hurricanes Helene and Milton, supercharged by climate change,
are expected to cost more than US\$50bn. Fires in California, heatwaves
in the sunbelt states, and flooding in the US South are wreaking huge
damage on Americans. Last year a poll showed a majority of them feel
that climate change is already causing serious effects.

**[[None of this stops the day Trump re-enters]{.mark} the White
House]{.underline}**.

Internationally, we've been in this position before. In 2001 George W
Bush quit the 1997 Kyoto deal. Last time Trump was in power, he left the
Paris agreement, albeit for a short time. **[I don't want to
downplay]{.underline}** the impacts of **[Trump]{.underline}**,
**[or]{.underline}** the **[Project 2025]{.underline}** agenda to which
he has been linked, **[but [climate action didn't stop then and it will
not stop now]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Other players, notably China, are]{.mark} increasingly [moving into
a leadership position]{.mark} on the issue]{.underline}**, **[because of
the strategic policy and economic interests it advances]{.underline}**.
The European Union is moving ahead with its green economic development
agenda despite a rightward shift in the balance of power across the EU27
-- with action on the climate emergency driving the economic development
needed for this region of 350 million people.

The US, if Trump does enact the changes he has campaigned on, will find
itself falling behind on new technologies and markets.

How damaging the second Trump presidency is to climate action depends
very much on how other countries react. If many follow Trump in either
rolling back -- or slowing down -- their action, the damage will be
severe, long-lasting and difficult to overcome.

On the other hand, **[if countries]{.underline}** stick together and, as
they should, **[deepen their commitments]{.underline}** aligning with
the Paris agreement's 1.5C limit, the **[[damage will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** significant but **[[not
severe]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### UQ---AT: US Leadership High---2NC

#### The US is ceding soft power leadership to China

**Huang 25**, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign
Relations, and a professor at the School of Diplomacy and International
Relations, Seton Hall University. (Yanzhong, 5-18-2025, "By eroding US
soft power, Trump is ceding the contest to China" *South China Morning
Post* accessed via Factiva) wtk

In the grand theatre of international politics**[, [soft
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- the art of attraction without coercion
or payment so eloquently defined by the late Joseph Nye -- **[[was long
considered the gleaming crown jewel of American influence and
the]{.mark} glaring [deficiency in]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark}
arsenal]{.underline}** amid the countries' rivalry for pre-eminence.

**[[Yet since]{.underline}]{.mark}** US President Donald
**[[Trump]{.mark}'s return to office]{.underline}**, **[[the
balance]{.mark} of international attraction has been [shifting
remarkably in Beijing's favour.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

On the domestic front, **[[the US]{.mark} administration's actions have
profoundly [compromised America's soft power]{.mark}
reservoir]{.underline}**. Its attacks on academic freedom and
termination of student visas weaken the allure of American higher
education, a key soft-power asset that fosters global appreciation for
US values.

**[[Cuts to]{.mark} federal research [grants]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
such as those for the National Institutes of Health, **[[threaten
America's]{.underline}]{.mark}** technological
**[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A recent Nature survey of
scientists in the US revealed an alarming finding -- 75 per cent of
respondents were considering relocating amid funding instabilities -- a
potential brain drain that would severely impair the nation's capacity
to attract and retain talent.

According to Nye, liberal democracies typically score high in national
attractiveness because they are generally perceived as more legitimate
and trustworthy than their non-democratic counterparts.

**[Trump's authoritarian tendencies]{.underline}** -- his expressed
admiration for autocratic leadership styles, prioritisation of loyalty
over expertise in staffing his administration and efforts to bend news
coverage to his will -- **[undermine]{.underline}** the rule of law, a
cornerstone of **[US soft power, tarnishing its image as an exemplar of
democracy.]{.underline}**

On the international front, **[[the administration has accelerated
America's soft power erosion through]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Nye
called its "**[myopic [transactionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**", **[as
well as its strident "America first" approach]{.underline}**. This
multifaceted diplomatic retreat manifests in three critical dimensions.

First, **[America's withdrawal from multilateral
frameworks]{.underline}** -- including the World Health Organization and
Paris climate accord -- **[diminishes its reputation]{.underline}** as a
collaborative leader and undermines US moral authority.

Second, and perhaps more alarmingly, **[Trump's policies systematically
dismantle the very instruments of American soft power, with institutions
like]{.underline}** the US Agency for International Development
(**[USAID]{.underline}**), Voice of America and Radio Free Asia
**[facing existential funding threats]{.underline}** or outright
dissolution.

Third, **[[the administration has adopted an adversarial diplomatic
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[as seen in]{.mark} Trump's
peculiar [intimidation of Denmark]{.mark} over Greenland]{.underline}**
and Vice-President J.D. Vance's derogatory comments about Chinese
"peasants" -- **[[that undermines America's]{.mark} carefully cultivated
[image]{.mark} as a benign hegemon]{.underline}**.

[**[In contrast]{.underline}**]{.mark} to the Trump administration's
dismissal of soft power, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** under
President Xi Jinping **[[has strategically bolstered its influence
through]{.mark} targeted [diplomatic initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Since 2021, Beijing has launched three major programmes -- the Global
Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global
Civilisation Initiative -- designed to project soft power by promoting
economic cooperation, security partnerships and cultural dialogue,
respectively.

In 2023, Xi furthered these efforts by announcing plans to invite 50,000
young Americans to China for exchange and study programmes over the next
five years. Together with the Belt and Road Initiative and soft power
endeavours like Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy, these initiatives have
yielded mixed results.

High-income countries such as the United States, Japan and Australia
maintain overwhelmingly negative views of China, with favourability
ratings as low as 11 per cent in a Pew survey last year.

But middle-income countries in the Global South, particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria: 75 per cent favourable, Kenya: 73 per cent)
and Southeast Asia (Thailand: 80 per cent, Malaysia: 64 per cent),
exhibit significantly more positive attitudes, driven by infrastructure
investments and diplomatic engagement.

**[[Trump's return is giving a boost to China's charm
offensive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Against the backdrop of eroded US
democratic institutions and America's retreat from international
commitments]{.underline}**, **[China's]{.underline}** assertive
**[foreign policy]{.underline}** and unapologetic authoritarianism
**[appear less threatening in comparison.]{.underline}**

In Asia, **[[China has been increasing its]{.mark} hard [military and
economic investments]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[but it has also been
cultivating its powers of attraction]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In 2007,
President Hu Jintao told the 17th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party that China needed to increase its soft power. The
Chinese government has spent tens of billions of dollars to that end.
Admittedly, it has achieved mixed results at best, owing to two major
obstacles: it has stoked rancorous territorial disputes with a number of
its neighbors, and the CCP maintains tight control over all
organizations and opinions in civil society. China generates resentments
when it ignores internationally recognized borders. And it comes across
poorly to people in many countries when it jails human rights lawyers
and compels nonconformists, such as the brilliant artist Ai Weiwei, into
exile.

At least **[[before Trump's second term]{.mark} began]{.underline}**,
**[[China lagged far behind the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[in]{.mark} the court of
[global]{.mark} public [opinion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Pew surveyed 24
countries in 2023 and reported that **[a majority of
respondents]{.underline}** in most of them **[found the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[more attractive than
China]{.underline}**, with Africa the only continent where the results
were even close. More recently**[, in May 2024]{.underline}**, **[Gallup

#### China's soft power is rising globally because of Trump's isolationism

**[[The global landscape is undergoing a profound
transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a tectonic shift in the balance
of influence. **[The sixth annual Global Soft Power
Index]{.underline}**, released by Brand Finance,
**[confirms]{.underline}** what many have observed: **[[China has
ascended to the world's second most influential soft power
nation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, trailing only the United States.

China's ascent is not a sudden phenomenon; it is the culmination of a
deliberate, multi-faceted strategy. Unlike the hard power dominance of
military might and economic coercion, soft power relies on attraction
and persuasion, on shaping perceptions and influencing preferences.

Since 2005, **[[China has aspired to become a polar great power]{.mark}
and has proven its ambition to project influence and power
globally]{.underline}** from the Arctic to Antarctica. **[[Through the

the three warfares strategy to **[[conduct influence operations in the
Arctic]{.mark} region, [focusing o]{.mark}n three overlapping Arctic

in Arctic affairs and [governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[its]{.underline}** [**[leadership]{.underline}** **[in scientific

**[trusted partner, and near-Arctic state]{.underline}**; **[to shape
Arctic states' perceptions of China's intentions;]{.underline}**
**[[and]{.mark} to [secure greater political and economic

through influence strategies seems nominal perhaps. At the same time,
**[Chinese state-related behavior in the Arctic remains under close

China's Strategic Interest in the Arctic

**[[China's interest in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** dates back to
the 1980s, though it was initially limited to scientific research. Since
2012, however, its involvement **[has
[intensified]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[with increased budget
allocations and strategic planning]{.underline}**. In 2013, China gained
observer status in the Arctic Council, even though it is not
geographically part of the Arctic region. **[In 2017, it announced the
Polar Silk Road]{.underline}**, and in 2018, it published a white paper
titled China's Arctic Policy.

According to some studies out of China, the Arctic may be navigable at
times by 2030. Beijing has already signed agreements with Russia,
Iceland and Greenland to secure access, aiming to establish the Arctic
as one of its key shipping routes.

**[[China's]{.mark} economic and strategic [power relies heavily
on]{.mark} manufacturing and [trade]{.mark}. This dependence requires
importing energy resources]{.underline}**---such as oil and natural
gas---**[and exporting manufactured goods]{.underline}**. **[Maritime
shipping is the primary mode of transport for both]{.underline}**. More
than 80% of global trade by volume is carried by sea. Most of China's
energy imports and goods exports depend on the Southern Hemisphere
route---as opposed to the Arctic, which represents the northern
route---specifically through the Pacific and Indian oceans. This path
includes key choke points and shipping routes such as the South China
Sea, Strait of Malacca, Arabian Sea, Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb,
Red Sea and Suez Canal, all of which are largely under US influence and
surveillance.

**[[Using the Arctic route can reduce travel time]{.mark} for Chinese
ships to Europe]{.underline}**---and back---**[by up to
40%.]{.underline}** **[If China also imports energy from the
Arctic]{.underline}**---where an estimated 30% of the world's
undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its undiscovered oil may be
located---**[transportation costs could be lowered on shorter shipping
times.]{.underline}** This could lead to reduced production costs,
increased profit margins, and greater competitiveness for Chinese
exports---all from a region that, unlike the southern route, does not
yet fall under US influence. Consequently, **[[the Arctic holds
significant geopolitical and economic importance for
China.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Russia's Strategic Interest in the Arctic

The Arctic is deeply rooted in Russian identity and history. Russia has
the strongest military and political presence in the region, with its
Arctic territory stretching across 24,140 kilometers of coastline. The
Kremlin now hopes to use the Arctic's natural resources to maintain its
influence over global energy markets, particularly natural gas. One of
Russia's longstanding geopolitical challenges has been its historic lack
of direct and reliable access to warm water ports. The thawing of the
Arctic and opening of the region to year-round shipping represents the
possibility of finally overcoming this longstanding geographical
disadvantage.

Year-round shipping via the Arctic holds out the promise of enhancing
Russia's geopolitical influence, elevating the country's strategic
importance in the calculations of China and Europe, while also
undermining US hegemony. It would also create significant economic
opportunities, reflected in the Kremlin's ongoing interest in developing
the Northern Sea Route.

While Russia views much of the Arctic as its domain and a component of
its national security, China's growing interest in the region may raise
concerns in the future. The current Russia-China cooperation is
primarily tactical, rooted in shared opposition to U.S. dominance.
Russia lacks the investment capacity to fully develop the Arctic and may
need Chinese capital, while China seeks Russia's political and legal
support in the region.

US Strategic Interest in the Arctic

The United States borders the Arctic via Alaska, which was acquired from
Russia in 1867 for \$7.2 million---a deal mocked at the time as
"Seward's Folly," named after US Secretary of State William H. Seward,
who handled the purchase. Today, however, it might be more accurately
described as "Seward's foresight."

**[With climate change accelerating in the Arctic and
Chinese]{.underline}** and Russian **[ambitions growing]{.underline}**,
**[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
has **[[increased its interest in the region to counter potential
strategic challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, the 2020 US
military budget included funding for the construction of a port in
Alaska to bolster US military presence in the Arctic, though the project
has since slipped into limbo due to cost overruns.

President Trump's repeated proposals and demands to acquire Greenland
from Denmark also fit within the emerging frame of Arctic geopolitics,
where Washington looks to expand its influence and counter Chinese and
Russian encroachment into the region.

Another factor behind the US interest in the Arctic is the enduring
influence of Alfred Mahan's (1840--1914) geopolitical doctrine on
American strategic thinking since the time of President Theodore
Roosevelt (1901--1909). Mahan was a friend and adviser to Roosevelt, and
his geopolitical ideas helped shape the president's policies. During
Roosevelt's presidency, the United States became the second most
powerful naval force in the world, behind the United Kingdom. Mahan
believed that world dominance could be achieved through control of
global trade routes that crossed the seas and oceans. Maintaining
dominance over the seas---not the land, as Halford Mackinder
believed---during both peace and war meant domination of the world.

Looking Ahead

Mahan's arguments and recent history suggest that **[[the Arctic could
become a major global trade route]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}**.
**[[If the United States does not gain significant influence over
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**---matching Washington's current dominance over
southern routes---**[[the result could be a significantly weakened US
hegemony and changes to the global order.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Strong US presence in the arctic [deters]{.underline} Chinese activity in the region

wtk

**[[The competition between China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[for global supremacy [is moving
into a new frozen theater.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The undeveloped Arctic region, with its wealth of resources, logistical
nodes for faster travel and vast military and strategic potential, has
long made it an important frontier for nations including Russia and the
U.S. seeking geopolitical dominance.

Now, the People's Republic of **[[China is looking to the Arctic as part
of its long-term strategy to replace the U.S. as the leading world
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** both economically and militarily. **[[It
wants the]{.mark} access and positional [advantage of potential new
shipping routes]{.mark} and resources that the Arctic region provides,
and China is investing and engaging in scientific studies [to increase
influence]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}**.

As a "near Arctic state," China is unable to pursue open military
presence in the region, so the country is pushing economically by
investing over \$90 billion in scientific research. The Chinese first
entered the region back in 2003 in Norway by building a research base
which began their expanse of influence within the region. It is also
establishing other connections with Arctic states and involving itself
in the counsels.

**[[This strategy is giving China a growing foothold]{.mark} in the
area.]{.underline}** **[The country's involvement in the free trade
agreement policy with Iceland also brings it to the table as it
discusses a future influential area with untapped recourses and closer
borders to more vulnerable regions of the world]{.underline}**.

At first glance, this approach seems simple and straight-forward,
however, a deeper look shows that China is conducting strategic moves
that will have long-term benefit for the PRC. Multiple attempts of
purchasing land has been made in nations in or near the Arctic regions,
including potential golf courses, three airfields, and a former military
base.

All of these proposals have been rejected by the Arctic state amid
growing concern of China choosing strategic infrastructure that would
develop ports, active airfields and access to future nodes. Even against
opposition, the PRC is able to partner with nations such as Finland and
Greenland to increase communication capabilities in new areas. It's is
also working on undersea cables along the Northern Sea Route to lessen
their dependency on external nations for information movement flows.

**[The]{.underline}** number one **[priority for the U.S. in the region
is security]{.underline}**,as outlined in the National Strategy for the
Arctic Region. Updates made in 2022 define more focused and achievable
goals after observing the lack of effort compared to other Arctic states
and near-Arctic nations. The U.S. goal is to protect its interests by
deterring potential threats and mitigating future risk.

**[[The best method to deter adversaries is by having a consistent and
strong presence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specialized training in harsh
Arctic environments prepares soldiers how to handle situations in
extreme cold weather that are harmful to people and leads to slower
mission planning and execution by substantial margins. Being able to
survive or thrive in temperatures below negative thirty degrees
Fahrenheit requires an already present and equipped force that has
established processes to win in that environment.

On June 6, 2022, the 11th Airborne Division was activated to achieve
success in those harsh environments. By executing expeditionary missions
and expanding the unknown impacts of multi-domain operations, they can
better predict how to win in an Arctic environment. They increase their
competence through the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center in
Alaska to make them a stronger presence in the Arctic to deter threats
and mitigate risk to previously vulnerable regions.

**[[China has had more than twenty years of strategically moving to
become an actual Arctic state player]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
investment far exceeds the time and effort the U.S. has put into the new
frontier]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The]{.mark}
[PRC]{.mark}]{.underline}** still lacks the advantage, but
[**[is]{.underline}** **[staged to be more
influential]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and successful in the joint
cooperation and infrastructure development required to maintain a
growing presence in the Arctic]{.underline}**.

The best time to start this endeavor was twenty years ago and the
second-best time to start is now. [**[America has started late in this
race and needs more foresight on how to win in the
Arctic]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Fort Greely's ground-based interceptors represent the largest

advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**: As the commander of the US 11th
Airborne Division based at Fort Wainwright quipped: "**[Whoever
[controls Alaska, controls the world]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

Reestablishing Arctic Dominance -- New US Investments in the Arctic

The delegation's visit to Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska provided
the delegation with a command briefing at the 11th Airborne Division.
Re-established in June 2022, the Division serves as the foundation of
the US Army's expanding Arctic capabilities. The visit to Fort
Wainwright came not long after the US Department of Defense published
its latest Arctic Strategy white paper. The new strategy is based on the
core assumptions that both climate change and great power competition
are driving fundamental change in the region, and the United States
needs to adapt its Arctic approach accordingly.

As the Division deputy commander made clear, **[[Alaska's vast northern
territory is vital]{.mark} for defending the US homeland]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**, across the state, **[the US military has
installed significant aerospace and maritime early warning and control
systems and links into the vast signals and command
infrastructure]{.underline}** of the bi-national US-Canada North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). In addition to its strategic
Arctic location, briefers noted its Alaska positions also allow for
rapid force projection into the Indo-Pacific. In addition, the broader
North American Arctic allows for both the US and Canada to project power
to Europe and defend vital transatlantic sea lanes of communication.

**[[Russia-China Arctic cooperation is growing]{.mark} as ice floes
recede opening new avenues for trade and areas for mineral
extraction]{.underline}**. Already, **[the Arctic is a vital and growing
strategic variable for Russian military and economic strategy, and
[China]{.mark}, which declared itself a near Arctic state in 2018, [has
been seeking new ways to anchor its military and economic
footprint]{.mark} across the region ever since.]{.underline}**

**[[To avoid being at a strategic disadvantage]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
this evolving new Arctic security environment, briefers noted, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and its
other Arctic Allies and partners **[need to [increase their ability to
operate]{.mark}]{.underline}** and cooperate [**[in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, **[as well as invest in the capabilities to allow
them to have greater vision into the rapidly evolving threat
picture]{.underline}**]{.mark}. US briefers used the alliterative
mnemonic enhance, engage, and exercise to summarise this new effort to
re-establish Arctic dominance.

Donald **[[Trump's victory]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this week's US
election comes with plenty of risks for China. But it also **[[hands
Beijing a rare opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The president-elect's climate credentials are known. He immediately
pulled out of the Paris Agreement after being inaugurated in 2017. He
vows to boost fossil-fuel production and terminate domestic green
policies he labels a "scam."

**[This should be Xi Jinping's cue]{.underline}**.

**[[Last time, China's efforts]{.mark} to play up global
expertise]{.underline}**, work with Europe and Canada, and bolster its
emission-reduction targets largely **[[came to
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Rather than being hailed as a leader,
Beijing was accused of not doing enough to curb fossil fuels.

**[But [fast forward to 2025, and China is in a much better position to
take advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Since the start of 2023, the nation installed 493 gigawatts of wind and
solar capacity --- about as much as France, Germany and the UK combined.
The massive amounts of new clean energy put it on the cusp of peak
emissions nearly a half-decade before the target.

**[China is still the biggest greenhouse gas emitter, and the most
important thing it can do for the climate fight is to keep cleaning up.
But the scale of the domestic market makes those transition efforts
largely self-reliant and immune from Washington's
vacillations]{.underline}**.

**[The country's solar, battery and electric-vehicle companies currently
dominate global production]{.underline}**. They made clean technologies
affordable, though they also resulted in
**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}** being pilloried for undermining other

The geopolitical dimension

**[[China's green shift will]{.underline}]{.mark}** enable it to
**[[increase its geopolitical influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a
number of ways:

**[[The first will be to weave a network of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
customers and **[[affiliates]{.underline}]{.mark}** to whom it will
provide, in exchange for land and natural resources, the electric
vehicles, photovoltaic panels and digital tools essential to their
development. After **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
**[[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}**n continent **[will obviously be a
partner of]{.underline}** choice for the deployment of such a strategy.

The **[[second]{.underline}]{.mark}** will involve **[[asserting a green
soft power and increasing China's influence in international]{.mark}
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The participation of Chinese
scientists in the work of the **[IPCC]{.underline}** (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change) is already recognised. In the Conferences of
the Parties on climate change (**[COP]{.underline}**), China's
positions, which were for a long time reserved and wait-and-see, have
become cooperative, and they could become more active and
proactive.\[8\] **[[China]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** already
**[[using these forums to forge special relationships]{.mark} [with the
countries of the South]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the future, **[[it
will be able to point the finger at]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[poor
performers]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the transition, **[[starting, of
course, with the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

After the New Silk Road, deploying Chinese technologies and
infrastructures as far as Europe and Africa, come the "Green Silk Road",
developing the energy, forestry and agricultural resources of the
equatorial and tropical belts. Two networks that will enable the Middle
Kingdom to weave a durable and solid web on planet Earth.

\*\*\*

The Chinese concept of an ecological civilisation, which was initially
just a strategic intention, is therefore gradually taking on the
dimension of a coherent political and civilisational project, even if,
paradoxically, the project's weakest point today remains its purely
environmental dimension. China's leaders are having to extricate
themselves from a heavy legacy of coal mining (China continues to build
and export coal-fired power stations), bring local governments into line
who are less convinced by the environment than the Party's strategists,
and find compromises between economic growth objectives and ecological
ambitions.\[9\]

Despite these weaknesses, the concept of ecological civilisation raises
a number of questions for Westerners:

The concept of ecological planning, which is at the heart of **[[the
Chinese project]{.underline}]{.mark}**, has been adopted by several
European countries, including France (which created, in 2022, a General
Secretariat for Ecological Planning, attached to the Prime Minister).
The European "green taxonomy", which classifies industrial sectors
according to their ecological impact (2022), is not unrelated to the
system of ratings and incentives deployed in China to encourage private
companies to improve their ecological performance.

The notion of civilisation, long regarded with suspicion, is making a
strong comeback in political and geopolitical analyses, with the idea
that one of Europe's weaknesses is its inability to think of itself as a
civilisation. Peter Sloterdijk explains, after Hubert Védrine, that
"Europeans have ceased to be interested in Europe and to identify
themselves as such". The notions of ecological civilisation,
"recivilisation" and the art of living are highlighted in many recent
essays. Jean Viard argues in favour of a "civilisation of the ecological
individual".\[10\] "The art of living, explains Giuliano da Empoli,
co-founder of the magazine Le Grand Continent, is the great antidote to
totalitarianisms, which want to put numbers on and control every
movement. The art of living is the opposite \[...\]. It's something
we're very attached to in the physical dimension of Europe". But is this
art of living compatible with an ecological ambition? Do we not see
certain ecologists, including liberals, proposing the use of an
"individual carbon account",\[11\] a formula which, in its principle and
operation (exploiting digital traces), is not so far removed from
Chinese social credit!

Lastly, the concept of ecological civilisation takes its place on a
geopolitical stage heavily dominated by civilisational conflicts and
references to ancient civilisational empires (Russian, Indian, Persian,
Ottoman, etc.). Could it help to "re-civilise" the global geopolitical
scene? To ward off the undesirable prospect of a "clash of
civilisations" by proposing the more positive prospect of civilisational
competition for the best ecological bounty?

Despite its current weaknesses, **[the]{.underline}** concept of
**[ecological civilisation [should not be
underestimated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By methodically declining it,
**[[China is in the process of imposing a new geopolitical frame]{.mark}
of reference]{.underline}**, [**[green]{.underline}**
**[power]{.underline}**]{.mark}. It has launched a ball that the West
will find difficult not to pick up.

### L---Domain Awareness---2NC

#### Increased domain awareness is key to US strategy of denying Chinese Arctic influence

**Auerswald 21**, professor of security studies at the U.S. National War
College in Washington, DC. (Dr. David Auerswald, 5-27-2021, "A U.S.
Security Strategy for the Arctic"
https://warontherocks.com/2021/05/a-u-s-security-strategy-for-the-arctic/)
wtk

Russia is not the only authoritarian power with increased interest in
Arctic affairs. In January 2018, **[Chinese]{.underline}** officials
**[published their first Arctic strategy document]{.underline}** and
attempted to buy and greatly expand Finland's Kemijärvi air base for use
by large Chinese aircraft, ostensibly for Arctic research. Their offer
was rejected, supposedly because the northern airfield is next to
Finland's Rovajärvi artillery range. This fits a pattern. **[China has
built Arctic research stations]{.underline}**, conducted ongoing
oceanographic surveys, **[and attempted infrastructure development
across the region]{.underline}**, **[projects that]{.underline}** some
believe **[have geostrategic]{.underline}** or military
**[purposes]{.underline}**.

In order to better position the United States for geopolitical
competition in the region, the Biden administration should write and
publish a new national security strategy for the Arctic. The United
States has a moribund 2013 Arctic strategy that was superseded by events
and ignored by the Trump administration. In 2019, the Office of the
Secretary of Defense released an Arctic strategy, and the Air Force,
Navy and Army each released their own subordinate strategies. However,
these individual strategies were not coordinated before being released,
did not fully integrate efforts with civilian foreign policy agencies,
and in some cases were produced only because of pressure from Sen. Dan
Sullivan from Alaska.

It is time to rectify those omissions**[. [A new Arctic security
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[should focus
on]{.underline}**]{.mark} deterring **[Russian]{.underline}** and
**[Chinese]{.underline}** military **[attacks]{.underline}** **[and
[preventing]{.mark}]{.underline}** their **[[attempts to weaken the
established Arctic international order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To avoid
mistakes from past Arctic national security, the Biden administration
should build an Arctic strategy that responds to future security
threats, can be resourced within constrained national budgets, and that
integrates military and civilian actions across the government and
private sector.

Goals for an Arctic Strategy

Though the Biden administration has yet to release a National Defense
Strategy and National Military Strategy, guideposts exist to begin
conceptualizing a new Arctic security strategy. Blinken expressed the
U.S. desire to keep the Arctic peaceful when speaking at the May 2021
Arctic Council ministerial meeting. The administration's March 2021
Interim National Security Strategic Guidance focuses on deterring and
preventing adversaries from threatening the United States and its
allies, inhibiting access to the global commons, or dominating key
regions (i.e., the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere).
Even though the document does not mention the region, its priority
actions are applicable to the Arctic, such as leading a stable and open
international system underwritten by alliances, partnerships,
multilateralism, and international rules.

**[[Any new U.S. Arctic security strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** should
have three goals: deter military attacks against U.S. or allied
territory originating from the Arctic, prevent China or Russia from
weakening existing rules-based Arctic governance through coercion, and
**[[prevent regional hegemony by]{.underline}]{.mark}** either
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** or Russia. **[[To accomplish these
goals, U.S. strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** should **[[develop military
capabilities]{.mark} for use in the]{.underline}** North American and
European **[Arctic]{.underline}** subregions and then demonstrate the
ability to use them in harsh Arctic conditions. The U.S. government
should persuade regional allies and partners that the United States can
be a trusted security partner in the region. Finally, the strategy
should contain inducements to the private sector to build dual-use
Arctic infrastructure that benefits the private sector while giving the
military platforms from which to observe and operate in the Arctic.

The Arctic's Geopolitical Context

**[[Any Arctic strategy is constrained by the region's harsh terrain and
weather conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[High latitudes and harsh
weather make]{.underline}]{.mark}** communications, global positioning,
and **[[domain awareness a significant challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}**
across the Arctic. In the Alaskan Arctic, ground-based infrastructure
outside the Anchorage-Fairbanks-Prudhoe corridor is localized rather
than interconnected and is dependent on bulk summer resupply**[. U.S.
security infrastructure in the Arctic comprises aging early warning
radars in Alaska and Greenland]{.underline}**, missile defenses and
significant 5th-generation fighter aircraft in Alaska, submarines in
Arctic waters, and modest rotational forces in Iceland and Norway. U.S.
relations with Arctic nations have been generally cooperative, with the
exception of relations with Russia on non-Arctic issues since 2014.
Finally, different security issues are associated with the three Arctic
subregions --- the North American, European, and Russian Arctic --- with
the European Arctic subregion being the area with the greatest security
challenges.

#### The plan secures US influence in the arctic

Freedom. (Daniel, 7-28-22, "U.S. Policymakers Should Remain Wary of

**[[China seeks to parlay its]{.mark} growing [partnership with
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**, on which Russia will necessarily rely as
the West cuts ties, **[as a way [to access Arctic
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A February 4 joint statement between
Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping agreed "to continue consistently
intensifying practical cooperation for the sustainable development of
the Arctic."51 The statement also stressed that "\[f\]riendship between
the two States has no limits, there are no 'forbidden' areas of
cooperation."52 However, whether the rhetoric translates into reality is
another matter. The Arctic is one of the few areas where Russia retains
the upper hand in its dealings with China, and despite the need for
Chinese investment and economic symbiosis in the Arctic, Russia is wary
of allowing China undue access to a region it deems critical to national
security.

For the most part, **[[China wants to increase]{.mark} access and
[influence in the Arctic]{.mark} region for economic reasons and it is
through this lens that U.S. policymakers]{.underline}** should
**[approach Chinese activity]{.underline}** in the Arctic region.

What the U.S. Should Do

**[China is expanding its economic influence across much of the world
and the Arctic region is no exception. As new economic opportunities and
security challenges]{.underline}** continue to
**[manifest]{.underline}** themselves in the Arctic, **[[the
U.S.]{.mark} must be prepared]{.underline}**. The U.S. government
should:

Promote economic freedom in the Arctic. Economic freedom spurs
prosperity, innovation, respect for the rule of law, jobs, and
sustainability. Most important, economic freedom can help to keep the
Arctic stable and secure. A secure and stable Arctic should be the focal
point of broader U.S. engagement in the region.

**[[Continue to invest in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the U.S. Coast Guard's
and U.S. Navy's Arctic **[[situational awareness
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[It is imperative that the Coast
Guard continue to expand its fleet and acquire a fleet of six
icebreakers through the Polar Security Cutter and Arctic Security Cutter
programs to assure access to this remote region.]{.underline}**53
**[[The remote and harsh conditions of the Arctic make unmanned systems
particularly appealing]{.underline}]{.mark}** for providing additional
situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.
The Coast Guard should also consider upgrading facilities, such as its
Barrow station, to reinforce its Arctic capabilities and demonstrate a
greater commitment to the region.

Deepen relations with Iceland. Iceland is an important NATO member and a
close partner in the Arctic Council. The Trump Administration ended
diplomatic sanctions applied to Reykjavik by the Obama Administration
over Iceland's whaling.54 The U.S. should use this new opportunity for
partnership to advance American interests in the Arctic.

Continue to raise awareness of China's questionable ambitions. China has
declared itself a "near-Arctic state"---a made-up term that does not
exist in Arctic discourse. The U.S. should work with like-minded
partners in the Arctic Council to raise legitimate concerns about
China's so-called polar silk road ambitions. The U.S. should also make
sure that China does not try to exceed what is allowed by its status as
an observer in the Arctic Council.

Acknowledge NATO's role in the Arctic for the first time. It is time
that NATO acknowledges that it is, in part, an Arctic alliance. The
Alliance's new strategic concept adopted in June failed to mention the
word "Arctic," with the region "High North" mentioned only in terms of
its importance for sending reinforcements to Europe in the case of a
broad conflict with Russia. NATO should rectify this glaring oversight
by recognizing the importance of the region as key theater, especially
after the likely accession of Finland and Sweden.

Make the U.S. diplomatic presence in Greenland full time. The opening of
a part-time U.S. consulate in Nuuk is welcome. A formal diplomatic
presence would be an effective way for the U.S. to better understand
local political and economic dynamics. This is particularity important
at a time when other global actors, such as China, are becoming more
involved in the Arctic region. But the U.S. should follow Iceland's lead
and make its diplomatic presence in Greenland year-round.

Explore ways of increasing economic links between Greenland and the U.S.
Greenland is actively trying to attract foreign investments, diversify
its economy, and more closely integrate into the world economy.
Greenland wants to raise the standard of living and prepare for eventual
independence from Denmark. With Greenland located in North America, and
with new potential transport links and tourism opportunities, the U.S.
should pursue policies that develop economic ties between the two
countries.

Consider the use of Svalbard for any required scientific needs. Due to
its location in the Arctic region and its particular environmental
conditions, Svalbard is very attractive for scientific research. In the
past, the U.S. Department of Defense has conducted research there, and
it should consider doing so in the future if the need arises. This is an
excellent way for the U.S. to "fly the flag" in a region with
significant geopolitical importance.

**[[America's interests in the Arctic region will only increase]{.mark}

**[Since establishing the PSR]{.underline}** in 2018, **[Beijing has
increased its utilization of a multitude of economic tools, most
particularly foreign direct investment, to advance China's interests and
influence in the Arctic region]{.underline}**.37 In the CNA report,
Exploring the Relationship between China's Investment in the Arctic and
Its National Strategy, such investments have concentrated heavily in
resource extraction industries of oil, natural gas, minerals, and rare
earth elements and critical transportation infrastructure---namely
tunnels, bridges, rail, and port and airport facilities. Through private
PRC-based companies and state-owned enterprises, China can provide
guidance and regulations to encourage, restrict, or prohibit particular
investments and to ensure consistency with Chinese national interests
and long-term strategic objectives. These investment projects have
either been completed or attempted in multiple Arctic states,
particularly Norway, Iceland, and Greenland, but most predominately in
Russia. China has made significate investments in Russia's oil and gas
industry, such as Yamal LNG, a liquified natural gas facility along the
NSR, and China continues to be Russia's primary foreign investor
following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.38 Aside from
Russia, China has concentrated its influence operations efforts on the
smaller Arctic states of Iceland and Greenland. Since 2008, both
countries were particularly politically and economically vulnerable to
foreign investment: the Icelandic economy fell into deep economic
depression following the global financial crisis, and Greenland adopted
the Self-Government Act, allowing for greater autonomy to negotiate
agreements with foreign states, independent of the Kingdom of Denmark.39
China has been developing bilateral commercial and economic relations
within Iceland and Greenland, investing in joint energy and minerals
exploitation and taking advantage of Iceland's bankrupt finances and
Greenland's ambitions to gain independence from Denmark.40

The U.S. Arctic interests have varied when considering its Arctic
policies and political actors\' discourse and actions towards the
Arctic, Alaska, and Greenland. However, there are three main interests
and themes throughout the U.S. Arctic rhetoric. The main themes that
have been consistent and proportionally larger than all the rest are
economic opportunities and military security. These [U.**[S. Arctic
ambitions]{.underline}**]{.mark} and interests both **[[seek to benefit
the U.S.'s economic, political, and societal security in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** region. Considering this U.S.'s
'protectionist' agenda in the Arctic, we can see that **[[the U.S.
heavily benefits from Arctic involvement,]{.mark} while non-state
actors, such as Arctic inhabitants and Indigenous peoples, do
not]{.underline}**. Repeatedly, throughout the discourse analysis,
**[there was a veil placed over the [U.S.'s]{.mark}]{.underline}**
actions and **[[inclusion of Arctic communities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This is purposefully executed. The veil placed over **["including and
co-managing with the Arctic communities"]{.underline}** mean this aim
**[falls short and]{.underline}** thus it **[is an empty promise by the
majority of U.S. politicians]{.underline}**. As discovered in the
discourse analysis, **[[this conceals the U.S.'s real neocolonialist
ambitions]{.mark} and capitalistic mentality towards the Arctic
region.]{.underline}**

As mentioned in the literature review, the U.S. has historically
prioritized economic security over both environmental and human
securities in the Arctic, and this continues to be the case (Silva,
2022). Many political elites in the U.S. have been wary of the U.S.
government and the presidential administration's motives and strategies
within the Arctic region (Hicks, 2007; Hossain, 2016; Sakakibara &
Ahtuangaruak, 2021; Kramer, 2022; Silva, 2022; Marlatt, 2022).
Furthermore, Arctic researchers claim that there is a negative
correlation between economic opportunities and human security, meaning
that the continued U.S. interest and prioritization of economic activity
and opportunities in the Arctic region, causes a decrease in human and
cultural security for Indigenous peoples and Arctic communities
(Filimonova, 2012; Pfaff, 2019; Arctic Energy Office, 2021).

For both Alaska and Greenland, the lack of prioritization and action to
include and promote visibility within the U.S. Arctic discourse shapes
the level of importance and seriousness of the agenda priority. The
**[U.S. political actors' discourse about Alaska suggests that Arctic
inhabitants were prioritized, yet]{.underline}** **[when implementing
investment projects]{.underline}** in natural recourse extraction, such
as the Willow Project or infrastructure developments like the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline, **['co-management and consideration' of Arctic
inhabitants was not exercised]{.underline}**. In turn, **[this severely
hinders Alaskan Arctic communities' human security.]{.underline}** With
a capitalistic drive to continue to invest and take advantage of
'emerging' natural resources due to the melting of permafrost, the
socioeconomic effects on the Arctic communities will be severe.
**[Pollutions, chemical spills from mining, oil spills, ecological
degradation, food shortages, issues with species abundance in for
hunting and fishing practices, cultural traditions and language, and
health security, are all human security issues that are hindered due to
a lack of prioritization and actionable steps for prevention in the U.S.
Arctic discourse]{.underline}** (Bjerregaard, 2001; Bjerregaard et al.,
2004; Curtis et al., 2005; Hicks, 2007; as cited in Lehti et al., 2009,
Rosen & Thuringer, 2017 and Carlin, 2019).

**[[On an international scale, the U.S. Arctic rhetoric versus the
underlying meanings]{.mark}]{.underline}** and discourse shape and
**[[affect]{.mark} the [human security]{.mark} of]{.underline}**
Greenlanders and **[other Arctic nations [even more than that of the
Alaskan communities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[as the U.S. is more
interested in protecting its own Arctic
inhabitants]{.underline}**]{.mark}, as was found in the discourse
analysis of Biden's National Strategy for the Arctic Region 2022, set
out in section 5.1.4. Given that the U.S. is one of the most powerful
states in the Arctic and a global hegemon, their actions and discourse
are being analyzed by other states to create their own policies and
Arctic strategies. **[If other states see that [the U.S. acknowledges
human security concerns of Arctic inhabitants, but that they do not
implement these]{.mark}, prioritize, or follow through with their words,
[the discourse will lead other states to believe that human
security]{.mark} or other 'soft securities' [are not as important as
hard securities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We can already see this at work
as the U.S.'s current interests are based around prioritizing economic
and military security in the Arctic region.

The inhabitants of Greenland are even more vulnerable. **[As the U.S.
continues to enter the Greenlandic economy indirectly through
neocolonialist back-dooring, there is no doubt the U.S. will try to do
this with other states in the Arctic]{.underline}** (Nwachuku, 2016,
p.). With the increased influence the U.S. will have in Greenland as
they prepare for deeper cooperation with Denmark and Greenland, many
scholars fear that **[Greenland could be the 'new' Alaska]{.underline}**
for the U.S. (Rosen & Thuringer, 2017 and Carlin, 2019). According to
the U.S. political actors' discourse, Greenland is seen as economically
and militarily promising which will cause societal and environmental
repercussions that will harm and displace Greenland's inhabitants and
its surrounding maritime region (Rosen & Thuringer, 2017, p.10).

The **[claims of]{.underline}** promoting and **[[prioritizing Arctic
Indigenous peoples only seem to apply to Alaskans and not those of other
Arctic states]{.mark}, considering how the U.S. political actors
discussed their interests in Greenland. [This shapes the discourse on
the human security of Arctic inhabitants]{.mark} outside of in the U.S.,
thus [raising concerns amongst other Arctic states regarding]{.mark}
potential [economic or military opportunism from the
U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[This signals the need for
caution when cooperating]{.underline}** or when making investment deals
**[with the U.S]{.underline}**. in the Arctic region. As discovered in
the findings chapter, the U.S.'s top interests in the Arctic deal with
economic or military security gain, whereas, human security is and will
be an afterthought when cooperating with U.S. in the Arctic region.
**[[The veil the U.S. used of 'helping' and 'cooperating'
is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to the discourse, **[[a tactic to
'protect' the U.S.'s reputation, presence, and future in the Arctic
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This insinuates that the **[human
security and social impacts upon Arctic inhabitants will be at risk when
their nations are cooperating with the U.S.]{.underline}**

With the intense focus and red thread of capitalistic and neocolonialist
frontiering revealed within the U.S.'s opportunistic and protectionist
ambitions for the region, **[the notable [lack of inclusion of all
Arctic]{.mark} communities and [Indigenous peoples indicates the U.S.'s
ambitions are focused on its own benefit]{.mark}, and not the position
of others in the region]{.underline}**. **[This goes against the U.S.
Arctic Policies strategy to be inclusive]{.underline}**, cooperative,
**[and concerned about Arctic inhabitants, as the U.S. is only
interested in how it can benefit from the region. [These]{.mark}
self-righteous]{.underline}**, self-concerned, and **[protectionist
[ideals contribute to]{.mark} the characteristics of capitalistic
advantages and [neocolonialist control exhibited by large
states]{.mark}, whilst increasing the vulnerability of]{.underline}**
smaller states and **[non-state actors]{.underline}**. This concept is
known to threaten human security issues. This is evidenced in the
findings chapter, which show how the U.S. political actors' discourse
solemnly addresses Arctic peoples' concerns or inclusion, hence
heightening their insecurity as Arctic inhabitants. The lack of
discourse on helping to preserve, include, and protect the Arctic
peoples' livelihoods, environment, cultural traditions, and language
shapes how seriously these people and their interests are considered.
With the U.S. political actors and Arctic Policies lacking the
actionable steps to include Arctic peoples, this suggests that the human
security of Arctic peoples is not an important focus of the U.S. in the
Arctic region. After explaining the theoretical framework's place within
the underlying U.S. motivations in the Arctic, I will set out the
discourse analysis findings of the U.S. Arctic Policies from 2009 to the
beginning of 2023, and provide a summary of the U.S. Arctic interests
found in the analysis. According to the findings from all U.S. Arctic
Policies published from 2009 to the beginning of 2023, the top three
U.S. interests in the Arctic were coded as environmental, economic
opportunity, and military security. Other U.S. Arctic interests
expressed in all the U.S. Arctic Policies were the inclusion of Arctic
inhabitants, geopolitical issues and tensions, Arctic cooperation, and
claims for increased U.S. sovereignty in the Arctic

region. Figure 6, which appears below, is a Tree Map diagram displaying
the compilation of all the U.S. Arctic Policies' top categories merged
into a proportional representation showing how much of the discourse was
coded under the underlying interests in the Arctic region. Figure 6
shows a summary of the top codes found when analyzing the U.S. Arctic
Policies from 2009 to the beginning of 2023, as explored in section 5.2.

According to the discourse analysis, the U.S. government is, firstly,
interested in the environment, secondly, the economic opportunities, and
thirdly, military security in the Arctic region. Other interests stated
within the U.S. Arctic Policies are Arctic cooperation, including the
Arctic inhabitants, geopolitical issues and tension, sovereignty of the
region, and Arctic frontiering. Figure 7, presented below, displays a
Tree Map diagram that shows a clear representation of the U.S. political
actors' top-coded underlying interests in the Arctic region. Figure 7
adds value to the discussion chapter as it highlights the interests and
themes within U.S. political actors' rhetoric about the Arctic region.

As presented in Figure 7, U**[.S. political actors' are]{.underline}**,
firstly**[, interested in prioritizing geopolitical issues, secondly,
military security]{.underline}**, thirdly, economic opportunities, and
Arctic cooperation. Comparing both figures, we can see that **[the
underlying interests]{.underline}** that the U.S. government prioritized
in its Arctic Policies **[are different when compared to the way that
U.S. political actors formally]{.underline}** and informally **[discuss
their Arctic interests]{.underline}**. Both the U.S. Arctic Policies and
**[[U.S. political actors are interested in Arctic cooperation,
but]{.mark} as the data shows, it is evident that the [U.S. security
interests and opportunities come first]{.mark}]{.underline}**, then
Arctic cooperation **[and including other Arctic peoples comes
second]{.underline}**. According to the data from both the U.S. Arctic
Policies and U.S. political actors' discourse, it is clear that both are
interested in economic opportunities and military security in the Arctic
region. It is particularly interesting that the U.S. Arctic Policies are
so heavily coded in environmental interests or concerns in the Arctic
region, yet this code is lightly covered or touched upon in the U.S.
political actors' statements. As mentioned in the findings chapter, the
**[[U.S. Arctic Policies seem to be greenwashing and
face-saving]{.underline}]{.mark}**5 **[[their ambitions]{.mark} and
interests [in the Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline}**, as the U.S.
government and presidential administration's actions do not coincide
with their policy strategies. The same assumption applies when analyzing
the inclusion of Arctic inhabitants in the U.S. Arctic discourse.

According to the U.S. Arctic Policies, **[the U.S. Arctic strategy is
interested in including]{.underline}** and considering the **[Arctic
inhabitants and Indigenous peoples, yet [only consideration of the
native communities of Alaska is mentioned]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[rather than all Indigenous peoples of the
Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark}. However, in the U.S. political actors'
discourse on the Arctic, there are few mentions of inclusion or
acknowledgment of Arctic inhabitants or its Indigenous peoples. The
answer to research question three confirms the inconsistency in
prioritizing the environment and Arctic peoples. The inconsistency is
explored in greater depth using human security theory, which explains
how the U.S. Arctic discourse is shaping human security issues in the
Arctic.

As reported in the findings chapter, **[the top U.S. interests in the
Arctic are grounded on economic opportunities, military security, and
Arctic cooperation]{.underline}**. **[[Looking at the U.S. interests
through a neocolonialist]{.mark} and capitalist [lens, it can be clearly
seen why the U.S. is prioritizing cooperation domestically with
Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}** and internationally with Greenland, as
well as how these underlying motives and themes of the U.S. political
actors' discourse shape the human security concerns for Arctic
inhabitants and Indigenous peoples.

Arctic Forecast and Recommendation: If well-established practices
continue, the second Trump administration will consider what portions of
this just-completed Arctic strategy it will emphasize while not
investing time and effort to revise it. For example, the next
**[[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}** administration **[[could
advance]{.underline}]{.mark}** both **[the [Arctic
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Trump's frequent calls to cut the
federal bureaucracy **[[by ensuring that]{.underline}]{.mark}** Alaskans
and **[[Alaskan Natives are]{.mark} heavily [involved in federal
government decisions about the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
particularly those that affect the U.S. portion of the Arctic. [**[Doing
so would also advance U.S. interests in the international
arena]{.underline}** **[since Alaskan Natives have an independent
voice]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[as Permanent Participants [in the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}** in addition to being domestic
constituents. Given its position on climate change, the Trump
administration will likely be willing to accept greater environmental
costs to achieve sustainable economic development than what the drafters
of the Arctic strategy envisioned.

#### Plan's a face-saving measure to justify aggressive US Arctic leadership

Due to the amplified U.S. interests in Arctic cooperation and
involvement, many **[Arctic scholars]{.underline}**, researchers, and
political actors **[have questioned the sincerity]{.underline}** and
underlying interests **[the U.S. has in the Arctic]{.underline}**
region. **[Historically, the U.S. has always been economically and
militarily interested]{.underline}** in entities. In recent and present
times, **[its capitalistic and neocolonialist behaviors continue to
shine through]{.underline}** its intense interest in investment and
**[becoming an indirect decision-maker in states to maintain its
international status]{.underline}**. Neocolonialism, capitalism, and
human securitization theory explain the underlying U.S. interests in the
Arctic region and how the junction of neocolonialism and capitalism
amplify human security issues.

Neocolonialism, originating from imperialism, has long been practiced by
the U.S. to influence more vulnerable and dependent entities by indirect
rule to benefit its own opportunities to develop. We can see that this
is the case regarding the U.S.'s interest in Greenland. Greenland's
economic dependence on external investments or FDI entices imperialist
states, such as the U.S., to invest in order to stabilize their
economies by investing in infrastructure across industries. With the
'back-dooring\' tactic of the U.S., via which it is attempting to impose
its ideals and interests, the U.S. slowly becomes a stakeholder and
weighty decision-maker in Greenland's politics. Today, this huge
motivating factor for the U.S. to cooperate with and economically invest
in Greenland, as Greenland's location is strategic for the U.S.
militarily, considering the current political tensions in the Arctic.

In respect of Alaska, the U.S. acquired the territory through a deal
with Russia, colonizing the land and its resources in 1867. This
approach is still very much in evidence today, considering how the U.S.
is idolizing its 'Arctic frontier' as a new means of economic
opportunity, through the inherent capitalistic drive of U.S. actors.
Capitalism explains the U.S.'s persistent obsession with economic
growth, investment, and the dominance of international trade. This
materialistic attitude towards the Arctic region's unveiling of natural
resources due to global warming has been exemplified in the last few
decades, and it is even clearer today. Both neocolonialism and
capitalism are centered on security strategies, specifically of the
larger more dominant states. This inevitably causes an extreme imbalance
between dominant states and smaller states, especially non-state actors.
The Arctic non-state actors that are **[most vulnerable are the Arctic
inhabitants and Indigenous peoples]{.underline}**. As the U.S. and other
large states are conducting 'big business' and colonizing the region
with increased sovereignty claims, the vulnerability of Arctic
inhabitants heightens. This is the case for both the Alaskans and
Greenlanders who feature in this research study. Human security theory
describes this dilemma. The theoretical framework of neocolonialism,
capitalism, and human security theory has been used to answer this
thesis' three research questions, along with the discourse analysis of
the U.S. Arctic Policies and the informal and formal statements by U.S.
political actors on their interests in the Arctic, Alaska, and
Greenland.

What are the U.S. interests in the Arctic from 2009 to the beginning of
2023? As thoroughly explained in the last chapter, the interests differ.
The U.S. Arctic Policies' underlying interests are, firstly, the
environment, then economic opportunities, and military security, whereas
the U.S. political actors prioritize geopolitics, military security, and
economic opportunities. Therefore, the two overlapping U.S. Arctic
interests are economic opportunities and military security.

How does the U.S. discourse about Alaska and Greenland compare in terms
of common themes, interests, and underlying rhetoric? While comparing
the U.S. political actors' discourse between Alaska and Greenland, the
underlying interests towards Alaska were first economic opportunities,
then concerns of societal impacts, followed by environmental concerns,
and then military security. In contrast, the discourse of U.S. political
actors concerning Greenland displayed underlying interests in military
security, then economic opportunity, and then geopolitical issues. The
discourse around Alaska was thus more considerate towards the societal
impacts upon the Alaskan communities and its Indigenous peoples, whereas
discourse in Greenland did not mention societal impacts, concerns, or
consideration for the human security or the inclusion of Greenlanders.

How does the U.S. discourse shape the human security of the inhabitants
of Alaska and Greenland? In short, the **[U.S. discourse shapes human
security because this aspect is not prioritized in the Arctic, as the
actions of the U.S. do not actually follow the Arctic Policy
strategy]{.underline}**. It is clear that **[the human security of U.S.
Arctic inhabitants is accorded more importance than that of the
Greenlanders, suggesting that other Arctic states should be wary of
cooperating with the U.S., as human security is an afterthought for the
U.S.'s Arctic interests]{.underline}**.

The discourse analysis of the U.S. Arctic Policies and U.S. political
actors' discourse showed that the **[[U.S.'s Arctic interests continue
to align with its historical neocolonialist ambitions to establish a
presence and maintain itself as a key actor and decision-maker in the
Arctic region]{.mark},]{.underline}** especially during the geopolitical
tensions and military security issues that arose in 2022. **[[The
U.S.]{.mark} also [utilizes]{.mark} capitalistic [economic opportunism
to gain decision-making power]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and dominance
in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** region. **[[We saw this through its
Arctic investment plans, infrastructure
developments]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and natural resource extraction
projects in both Alaska and Greenland. By approaching this in a
neocolonialist and capitalist manner, it is evident that human security
issues will arise due to the vulnerability and dependence of smaller
entities when larger states possess this kind of power and influence.
The **[qualitative research showed]{.underline}** that the U.S. is most
interested in furthering its economic and military security, and this
shone consistently through in every statement of this analysis. **[There
was]{.underline}** with little to **[no interest in or action taken
concerning]{.underline}** the environment or **[the inclusion of Arctic
Indigenous peoples]{.underline}**, although these aspects were
prioritized in the U.S. Arctic Policies from 2009 to the beginning of
2023. The discourse analysis also indicates that the U.S. Arctic
Policies are more like domestic policies than foreign policies,
**[considering the lack of an agenda to cooperate and establish
international goals in the Arctic region, whilst simultaneously
excluding other Arctic inhabitants]{.underline}**. Additionally, the
discourse analysis suggests that **[[the U.S.]{.mark} has always and
[will]{.mark} continue to [prioritize]{.mark} and act according to [its
own interests]{.mark}, specifically [in hard security]{.mark} measures,
[with soft security being mentioned in an attempt to save
face]{.mark}]{.underline}**, nevertheless, will a failure to focus on
it.

As discussed, the U.S.'s interests in the Arctic are deeper than its
rhetorical pronouncements. **[[The U.S. utilizes its Arctic Policy as a
face-saving tactic to draw a curtain over its neocolonial
ambitions]{.mark} and capitalistic behaviors [in the Arctic]{.mark}
region]{.underline}**, **[suggesting that the U.S. is more of an Arctic
adversary than Arctic ally]{.underline}**. To conclude, I recommend
being wary of U.S. Arctic Policy rhetoric, as U.S. political actors'
discourse reveals the U.S.'s actual Arctic interests, exposing what is
hidden beneath the tip of the iceberg.

Renewable Energy as a National Security Strategy

Alaska has incredible potential for renewable energy production**[. [The
U.S. should focus on expanding renewable energy in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only to meet its climate change goals,
but as a national security strategy **[[to counter growing]{.mark}
Russian and [Chinese influence]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}**.
Alaska's coasts are abundant in untapped wind resources. Renewable
energy accounts for 30% of Alaska's electricity generation as of 2019,
but only about 8% of this is from wind energy. The map above, provided
by the Department of Energy, outlines the potential for coastal wind
generation on Alaska's coasts. Furthermore, despite Alaska's long
winters and nights, solar energy is an increasingly valuable energy
source for off-grid applications in remote areas. Exploring wind and
solar production in Alaska can benefit U.S. national security in two
main ways:

First, **[[The U.S. can use renewable energy infrastructure to justify
an increased U.S. presence]{.mark}, in a similar manner that Russia uses
oil and gas.]{.underline}** Establishing a sustainable structure of
microgrids and **[[renewable energy production will take both time and
resources, of which the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[can use as platforms for increased
power projection through military outposts.]{.underline}** **[This will
allow the US to increase power projection in the
Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark} and help mitigate a Russian response by
providing both a valid reason for increased US forces and a method to
gradually increase military presence, rather than give the appearance of
a rapid military buildup. Moreover, climate change is negatively
impacting current military infrastructure. Alaska is home to multiple
military bases and infrastructure, which are currently being damaged by
thawing permafrost and coastal erosion, which changes the landscape and
damages this infrastructure. The U.S. needs to maintain this
infrastructure, similar to Russia's renovations of its Arctic military
infrastructure.

#### The US will use the plan as a rationale to scale up [military power projection]{.underline} throughout the Arctic and to boost Arctic leadership

The Arctic region is at the intersection of climate security, energy
security, and great power competition, which presents a complex national
security challenge for the United States. On average, Arctic sea ice is
decreasing by about 13.1% every decade; the cause is climate change.
This ice melt is opening up new potential trade routes and providing
access to previously inaccessible natural resources. The Arctic is
estimated to hold approximately 13% of the world's undiscovered oil
supply and 30% of its untapped natural gas. Combined with the potential
for wind, solar, geothermal energy, and new trade routes, the Arctic is
increasingly gaining global attention, particularly from Russia and
China. This all makes the Arctic a vital geostrategic location for U.S.
national security. However, **[[the U.S. is at a disadvantage in the
region compared to]{.mark} our [adversaries because of historic
stagnation in Arctic policy]{.mark} [that prevented]{.mark} substantial
[long-term investment]{.mark} into the region. [The U.S. must develop a

### L---Permafrost Co-op---2NC

#### BRICs permafrost cooperation is increasing -- it's boosting Chinese and Indian leadership

The combination of these three dynamics opens up a new paradigm for
scientific research on permafrost. As a matter of international
security, tensions over permafrost research are taking on a strategic
dimension, while global climate and ecosystem changes are accelerating
and threatening the stability of human societies**[. While the
dissociation in scientific research between the West and Russia is
consolidating as a structuring state of affairs in the Arctic region,
[new cooperative ventures are emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[As
India and Russia deepen]{.mark} their [cooperation in polar sciences,
Sino-Russian cooperation]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the field of [permafrost
has become comprehensive in scope]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Bilateral
cooperation is primarily focused on scientific and technological
innovation through academic exchanges and research programs (Xiaohong et
al., 2022). Conversely[, **[this partnership also encompasses economic
initiatives]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[between the two countries,
particularly in the energy sector]{.underline}**. **[The oil and gas
pipeline infrastructure connecting the two countries spans permafrost
regions]{.underline}**, requiring engineering solutions to address
permafrost degradation as a consequence of human-induced global warming
(Li et al., 2021).

In light of the ongoing transformations in international cooperation
within the field of polar science, the monitoring of permafrost is
increasingly assuming the status of a security concern for climate
science, given its pivotal role in influencing the Earth's climate and
ecosystem. In conjunction with the lack of standardization of permafrost
monitoring data, permafrost research is now confronted with the
reconfiguration of the data flow. The introduction of this additional
layers serves to compound the fragmented characteristics of permafrost
monitoring data, thereby increasing the risk of data decoupling
following the failure of the post-Cold War Arctic institutional
arrangement. Indeed, the control of data flow is of fundamental
importance in the process of turning scientific analysis into applied
policy, especially in the context of the climate crisis. **[[While
Western countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a) **[[and]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** (b) **[[remain
disconnected]{.underline}]{.mark}** from each other, **[[the Asian
powerhouses]{.underline}]{.mark}** (c) **[[are emerging as the main
recipients of an integrated view of permafrost
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, **[countries such as
[China and India]{.mark}]{.underline}** (c), which have a global
cryosphere policy, **[[could benefit by assuming a scientific leadership
role]{.mark} in the field of permafrost]{.underline}** through access to
(a) and (b) areas. This forthcoming dynamic has the potential to exert a
significant influence on the future direction of permafrost research, as
evidenced by the development of new scientific programs and
publications. In broader terms, **[[these countries may reshape science
diplomacy in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** by bridging cryosphere
areas and connecting climate science and security issues. Given that
climate change is defined as an international security issue, permafrost
monitoring becomes an object that intersects climate science and
security. Ultimately, **[[this could bolster the legitimacy of
China]{.mark} and India]{.underline}** **[in their role of redefining
the architecture of global security in the context of the long-term
challenges associated with the Earth's transformation]{.underline}**.

China and NATO Arctic States

ambitions in the region]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** has aggressively branded itself a

#### A US-Russia Arctic deal will lock China out of the region

Sylvie **Zhuang,** 3/16/20**25** -- "Warming US-Russia ties could put
China\'s Arctic ambitions on ice, experts warn" South China Morning
Post, factiva //DH

**[[Beijing has relied on Moscow for access to the far north but a
geopolitical realignment is under way that could see it frozen
out]{.underline}]{.mark}**

China is expected to redefine its Arctic policy -- including an ambition
to become a great polar power by 2030 -- amid growing scrutiny from far
northern countries and a possible US-Russia cooperation deal for the
region, according to experts and insiders.

Beijing put forward its plan for a "Polar Silk Road" -- as a complement
to its massive infrastructure scheme, the Belt and Road Initiative -- in
a 2018 white paper that envisioned greater access to the Arctic's rich
natural resources and a bigger role in its governance.

China's description of itself in the plan as a "near-Arctic state" --
despite sitting 1,400km (870 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and
having no territory in the region -- raised the suspicions of the US and
its allies, in the midst of intensifying geopolitical rivalries.

It also provoked a backlash from the Arctic countries -- including
Russia, which stretches across more than half of the region's coastline
and has long prioritised maintaining its sovereignty there.

Since then, **[[China]{.mark} has [put]{.mark}]{.underline}** more
**[[emphasis on science diplomacy]{.mark} -- including a focus on
building heavy icebreakers and carrying out polar
observations]{.underline}** -- while largely toning down its other
ambitions.

According to Marc Lanteigne, a professor of political science at the
Arctic University of Norway, "**[[China has been trying to
rework]{.mark} what [the Polar Silk Road]{.mark} is all about
[and]{.mark} it has also started to [take a more practical approach to
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**".

An insider with direct knowledge of the situation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, noted that Beijing's interest in continuing its
Arctic push had appeared to decline in response to the geopolitical
tensions.

"The Chinese interest was really first announced quite aggressively in
the white paper \[with\] the term near-Arctic state that everybody seems
to have had problems with," the insider said.

"Now the Chinese have stopped using that term and I think we've seen a
withdrawal, or a significantly lower Chinese interest in the Arctic."

However, Duncan Depledge, an Arctic expert and lecturer in geopolitics
and security at Loughborough University in Britain, noted the continued
emphasis on building heavy icebreakers. "I'm not convinced that China's
interest in the Arctic has declined," he said.

"I believe China is still very interested in many of the opportunities
that exist to become more involved in Arctic science and commerce."

The commitment to carry out polar observations and develop heavy
icebreakers is part of China's national development strategy, written
into the 14th five-year plan for 2021-25.

China now has four of the sturdy vessels, of which the latest is the
Jidi, which means "polar region". It was completed last year to support
research in the Arctic alongside the Xuelong 1 and Xuelong 2
icebreakers.

In an interview with People's Daily in October, the China State
Shipbuilding Corporation's chief expert Wu Gang said that "the key
technical challenge now for China is to build heavy icebreakers".

With expertise concentrated in the Arctic nations and only Russia
possessing nuclear-powered icebreakers, China still faced a "long and
difficult road ahead", according to Wu's remarks in the report.

**[China and Russia have been working together to develop the sea routes
that are opening up]{.underline}** as a result of global warming,
raising the possibility of a lucrative permanent sea lane that would
slash shipping times between Europe and Asia.

In August last year, Premier Li Qiang and his Russian counterpart
Mikhail Mishustin signed a joint communique in which the two countries
agreed to develop Arctic shipping routes.

State-owned **[Chinese companies have also been exploring the region's
natural resources]{.underline}**. In December, the China Oilfield
Services rig COSL Prospector discovered up to 52 million barrels of oil
in an appraisal well in Norwegian Arctic waters.

Nato has been concerned about China's activities in the region,
including its collaboration with Russia, the only non-member of the
military alliance that sits on the Arctic Council, the
inter-governmental organisation established in 1996.

The other members of the council are the United States, Canada, Norway,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden. China and 12 other countries --
including France, Germany and Japan -- have observer status and can take
part in its discussions.

In 2022, Nato's then secretary general Jens Stoltenberg stressed the
need for the alliance to establish a stronger presence around the North
Pole, where Russian military activities were on the rise.

**[There are signs that China-Russia cooperation in the region is
extending to military operations]{.underline}**. In October, the Chinese
coastguard joined its Russian counterpart on patrol for the first time,
sailing from the North Pacific into the Arctic Ocean.

Without naming China directly, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly
said in December that Ottawa needed to be "tough" in its response to
growing Arctic competition because "many countries, including non-Arctic
states, aspire for a greater role in Arctic affairs".

Canadian concerns were also raised in 2020, when Ottawa blocked Chinese
state-owned Shandong Gold Mining from acquiring a Toronto-based firm
that runs a gold mine in the Arctic, on national security grounds.

But Beijing's collaboration with Moscow should be viewed as "more
occasional than strategic", according to the anonymous insider. "I think
it's very important that we distinguish clearly between Russia and
China," the source said.

"Russia poses an immediate military threat and the Chinese goals are
more long term -- focused on research and shipping -- and \[China's\]
military interest tends to be quite far away \[from Nordic countries\]."

**[[The sudden warming of the relationship between Russia and the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}** since President Donald Trump's return to the
White House **[[may]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[affect China's
Arctic ambitions]{.mark},]{.underline}** according to Loughborough
University's Depledge.

**[China's bilateral ties with Russia have deepened significantly over
the years, strengthened by their shared view of the US as a
rival]{.underline}**, and culminated in Beijing's pledge of a
"no-limits" partnership with Moscow, days before the invasion of
Ukraine.

**[But [Washington's sudden shift on]{.mark}]{.underline}** its
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** stance under Trump has **[[created
uncertainties for Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with the US pursuing a
ceasefire while also looking to restore relations with Russia.

Trump has already expressed an interest in the Arctic and a deal between
the US and Russia that includes cooperation in the region could get
under way after their discussions on Ukraine.

"I think **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** for now [**[will
struggle]{.underline}**,]{.mark} particularly **[[in a scenario where
Trump and Putin made a deal on the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
was explicitly trying to exclude China from the region," Depledge said.

"If all of that happens, **[then it becomes a question of who would
Russia rather work with?]{.underline}** Would they rather work with
China or would they rather work with Trump? Or will they seek to
maintain a balance between the two?"

Given the shifting dynamics between Washington and Moscow, **[China's
reliance on Russia for its access to the Arctic could be "a risky
strategy",]{.underline}** according to Depledge, who also noted that
"**[it would be quite hard for China to find other ways
in]{.underline}**".

Lanteigne, from the Arctic University of Norway also noted that
**[[China remained dependent on "Russia's goodwill" to access the polar
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while pointing out that there was added
uncertainty for Beijing arising from a less functional Arctic Council.

#### Russia-PRC science diplomacy is expanding over the Arctic now because of US scientific isolation

**[[Scientific]{.mark}]{.underline}** and technological **[[cooperation
between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and
beyond---**[[has significantly evolved]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
last decade, **[[as both countries' relationships with the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and
other NATO members **[[have become]{.mark} increasingly
[tense]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Russia's]{.underline}**]{.mark}
initial economic and political **[[isolation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the aftermath of its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the acceleration of
that isolation **[following]{.underline}** the full-scale invasion of
eastern **[Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2022 **[has [made cooperation with
the PRC more attractive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the same time, a
growing wariness of Chinese strategic ambitions, coercive economic
tactics, and focus on dual-use technologies, has slowed Beijing's
efforts to advance economic and scientific collaboration with NATO
Arctic powers. **[[With other avenues of Arctic engagement restricted,
Moscow now offers Beijing the best pathway]{.mark} to further its Arctic
interests]{.underline}**.

**[Greater strategic and economic alignment]{.underline}** between the
two powers, driven by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese
counterpart, Xi Jinping, **[is fueled by scientific
collaboration]{.underline}**. **[While efforts to better understand and
mitigate climate effects have served as important
justifications]{.underline}** for Beijing's inclusion in Arctic
scientific and multilateral forums, and are cited as evidence for the
need to resume international collaboration with Moscow, **[climate
mitigation actually holds little interest for Putin and Xi who view the
Arctic primarily through the strategic lens of national and economic
security]{.underline}**. **[[Academic institutions from both countries
have launched joint research initiatives on climate-relevant
topics]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as water ecology and permafrost (two
issues that have direct implications on Chinese and Russian societies),
**[[but these efforts largely serve to preserve regime
stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Arctic scientific cooperation between the PRC and Russia has evolved
from commercial applications to facilitate shipping and navigation along
the NSR to a more geological focus with relevance for dual-use
capabilities in space and in the deep sea. The PRC's MCF strategy and
the involvement of institutions associated with the PLA make it likely
that scientific data collected during Arctic missions helps inform
Chinese military interests in that region and research and development
efforts in Beijing's and Moscow's broader defense sectors.

Nonetheless, as outlined in GMF's previous paper in this series, some
limits on this evolving partnership continue. Beijing's third
polar-capable vessel, for example, will be conventionally powered,
despite previous plans by the PRC and Russia to collaborate on a
nuclear-powered icebreaker, which would have relied on existing Russian
technology. Beijing's long-standing skepticism of relying on Russian
technology, and Moscow's long-standing skepticism of sharing it, may
persist.67 But the limits may be beginning to erode, which suggests a
growing level of trust and pragmatic scientific engagement that could
deepen over time.

As in other domains, Beijing and Moscow continue to seek to diversify
their partnerships and balance their growing bilateral cooperation and
trade relationships through engagement with others. Russia has recently
increased its courtship of other "friendly powers", including other
BRICS+ countries. **[[The PRC, to facilitate broader engagement in the
Arctic and develop its Polar Silk Road]{.underline}]{.mark}**---which
relies on access to ports, airfields, and communication and data centers
along the route---**[[is]{.mark} [eager to continue its
political]{.mark} and economic [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}** with
other Arctic powers. Beijing also seeks to portray itself as a
responsible power, but its increased rhetorical support68 of Moscow and
its tangible support for Russia's war economy has begun to cross a
threshold that may force the United States and its NATO partners to
respond to PRC actions more forcefully.

Scientific Research

The three warfares strategies are the most subtle in the realm of
scientific research, **[[by maintaining China's presence]{.mark} in the

and collaboration with Arctic states, **[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[**[inside and outside the region]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to set the
conditions for legal participation]{.underline}** in the geopolitical
arena and support China's long-term strategic objectives in the Arctic.
Public opinion, legal, and psychological aspects of the three warfares
strategy have been shaped by mostly contemporary Arctic-related
developments. In 1993, China purchased an icebreaker from Ukraine,
upgraded the vessel for polar conditions, and named it the Xue Long,
translated as the Snow Dragon.31 In 1999, China launched its first
national scientific research expedition to the Arctic into the Bering
and Chukchi Seas. In 2019, a second polar-capable icebreaker, the
domestically built Xue Long 2, entered into service, and China is
reportedly planning to build a third polar-capable icebreaker.32 Since
1999, the Chinese National Arctic Research Expeditions (CHINARE) have
conducted 12 expeditions into the Arctic, with the Xue Long and Xue Long
2 as the primary research vessels. In 2004, China built its first Arctic
research center, the Yellow River Station, in Ny-Ålesund, Norway. Since
2004, China has built a satellite ground receiving station in Kiruna,
Sweden, in 2010; a second remote-sensing satellite ground station near
Kiruna in 2016; and the China--Iceland Arctic Science Observatory
station in Kárhóll, Iceland, in 2018. Additionally, China unsuccessfully
pursued scientific research stations in Canada and Greenland.

**[[China's scientific]{.mark} development [interests invest heavily
in]{.mark} bilateral and multilateral [cooperation]{.mark}, focusing
significantly in forums that allow for non-Arctic state
participation]{.underline}**, **[[that can bolster China's image as
an]{.mark} extraregional [Arctic power protecting the common
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[raise its environmental profile,
and legitimatize its participation in the Arctic governance]{.mark}
regimes]{.underline}**.33 Public sentiment and academic commentary
within the PRC highlights the importance of China as a scientific and
technological power that must play an active, preemptive, and vigilant
role in exploration, exploitation, development, and governance in Arctic
affairs.34 **[[China's science diplomacy is]{.mark} an example of
psychological and public opinion warfare [setting conditions for future
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Arctic with legal effects
**[[enabling legitimization for those future

cooperation, **[[Beijing can conduct influence operations utilizing its

normalize China's presence in the Arctic, to gain acceptance or
indifference from Arctic states to its presence in the region, and to
solidify the PRC's self-narratives as an important stakeholder and
near-Arctic state]{.underline}**.35

[**[Gaining increased access into the Arctic for scientific purposes
remains an]{.underline}** **[important regime endeavor]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[facilitates other access
goals]{.underline}**]{.mark}. However, China also knows how to establish
its own access and influence. The opening of the China--Nordic Arctic
Research Center (CNARC) in Shanghai is an excellent example. This
institute allows China to attract international participation while
having significant control over agendas and interests. The organization
also helps to strategically improve China's legitimacy and need to be an
Arctic governance actor.

against this endeavor. With the destruction of USAID, and the Congress'
refusal to stand up for the budget that it previously approved to
support its vital mission, **[[it's as if China had succeeded in
convincing the U.S.]{.mark} government [to]{.mark} [surrender]{.mark}
all its best tools for commanding respect, goodwill, and
[influence]{.mark} abroad.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, **[[China continues
to]{.mark} seed and [cultivate its own influence through the]{.mark}
[Belt and Road]{.mark}, all while America looks the other
way.]{.underline}**

America's soft power is what makes it different from its adversaries.
Rather than coercing, cajoling, and corrupting countries around the
world, American foreign policy should be based on attracting, asking,
and advising. The United States should attract because there is inherent
good and value in our system and working with the United States is
preferable to falling prey to authoritarian interests. Asking (not
telling) signals respect to those our country wishes to influence---by
listening and demonstrating that the U.S. genuinely values them as
partners, we create lower-risk environments that build life-long trade
and security relationships. By advising, we offer our own expertise to
improving quality of life and governance abroad, instilling American
values to create partnerships that ultimately make the world a safer and
more secure place. The alternative is infinitely more expensive and
deadly---just ask Russia.

As our country engages in the rapid unscheduled disassembly of its own
institutions with a mix of glee, apathy, and horror, critics of the old
status quo will state that these organizations were full of waste,
fraud, and abuse. Most Americans agree that it is absolutely worth
analyzing these organizations for effectiveness and efficiency.
Unfortunately, **[[the current approach]{.mark} by the
administration]{.underline}** and DOGE **[[appears hell-bent
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** throwing out all the good with the bad,
completely **[[disregarding]{.mark} the measurable
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** and impact these **[agencies have had
in benefiting the United States and its foreign policy
objectives]{.underline}**. While no organization is perfect, and
certainly examples of misused funding are documented, that's when you
hire trained professionals to help improve the organization instead of
committing arson.

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Russia, and Iran
[**[will]{.underline}** **[undoubtedly seize the opportunity to fill the
vacuum]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and our lawmakers should be appalled by
the speed at which the United States is actively dismantling its most
historically effective means of establishing goodwill abroad and respect
for the United States. They should stand up for these proud institutions
of American soft power, but instead the champagne is flowing in Moscow,
Beijing, and Tehran. The question is, why is America pouring the drinks?

#### China is pouncing on US absence [despite]{.underline} differing leadership models

wtk

The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[cut foreign aid programs
so abruptly]{.underline}**---and unconstitutionally---**[that children
around the world are now dying from starvation]{.underline}** and public
servants who dedicated their careers to making the world a better place
have been left jobless. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the other
hand, [**[sees opportunities to]{.underline}** **[expand its
development]{.underline}**]{.mark} and diplomatic impact. **[[It
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[pouncing on
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. Agency for International Development
(**[[USAID]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[vacuum]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
offering funding for infrastructure investment, humanitarian aid,
health, and education in Nepal, Colombia, and the Cook Islands, for
example. Recently, after a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, China sent
aid worth \$14 million---eclipsing Trump's late and comparatively measly
\$2 million pledge.

**[[Although China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** aid and **[development
[model]{.mark}]{.underline}** (typically big-ticket loans for
infrastructure) **[[differs]{.mark} from that of the United
States]{.underline}** (mostly grants aimed at capacity building),
[**[China will opportunistically fill gaps left by the United
States]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Further expansion of China's development
model would see aid conditioned less on good governance and human
rights. Ideology shouldn't be a condition for aid, but China's model
could indirectly empower dictators who don't respect human rights.
Countries may feel pressured to vote with China at the United Nations or
to endorse Chinese political viewpoints due to fear of retaliation or
being cut off from needed aid.

What's more, **[Trump wants to make drastic cuts to the State
Department's budget and close U.S. diplomatic posts
abroad]{.underline}**, **[ceding more ground to China's already larger
diplomatic footprint]{.underline}**. [**[With an even smaller diplomatic
presence]{.underline}**, **[the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[will have a weaker voice on the
global stage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, reduced capacity to respond to
crises and emerging challenges such as climate change and terrorism, and
shortcomings in intelligence and analysis---which will ultimately make
it harder to protect American interests, values, and citizens abroad.
China's promotion of authoritarian efficiency at the expense of personal
and political freedoms will also grow more influential as the United
States' absence on the world stage makes it more difficult to contest.

#### The Arctic is key to China's [global]{.underline} legitimacy

wtk

China's three warfares strategy represents a tool meant to facilitate
global Sino ambitions through specialized regional application,
including the Arctic. Beijing's fundamental position on its need to be
an equal governance actor in the Arctic exists through its global
equities (great-power access) and concerns (climate-change impacts).
**[[Chinese global and Arctic legitimacy cannot be
separated]{.underline}]{.mark}** according to the regime, which presents
advantageous geopolitical circumstances for China. **[China's ability to
effectively compete in various sectors throughout the world allows
Beijing to set conditions for additional influence that is often
difficult to contest]{.underline}**. For example, **[the PSR policy
involving the Arctic is largely an extension of the multiregional
BRI.]{.underline}**

The three warfares strategy is most pronounced in the geopolitical
arena, by penetrating bilateral and multilateral institutions,
governance regimes, and decision making to facilitate positive legal,
psychological, and public opinion effects to set conditions for China's
long-term strategic objectives in the Arctic. Since 2013, **[Beijing has
increased China's participation in Arctic affairs]{.underline}** and
governance as an observer to the Arctic Council; as a partner in the
Arctic Circle Forum, hosting the organization's annual assembly in
Shanghai in 2019; as a member of the Arctic Economic Council; as chair
of the Pacific Arctic Group, organized under the International Arctic
Science Committee; as a full member of the North Pacific Coast Guard
Forum; and through China's permanent seat on the UN Security Council.26
**[China's engagement in organizations]{.underline}**, inside and
outside the Arctic region, facilitates the building of bilateral and
multilateral relationships that provide opportunities for generating
influence and political power.27 In 2018, the Agreement to Prevent
Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean (the CAO
agreement) was negotiated and implemented among the Arctic coastal
states of Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States and
non-Arctic states with distant-water fishing capacity, China, the
European Union, Iceland, Japan, and South Korea, aligning with Chinese
policy positions and preferences outlined in China's Arctic Policy white
paper. The CAO agreement is an example of legal warfare setting
conditions for future operations in the Arctic with psychological and
public opinion effects enabling those future operations. China's
participation and ratification of the CAO agreement consolidated
Beijing's long-term position in Arctic fisheries regimes and prevented
restrictions on Chinese marine scientific research, while nurturing its
environmental profile and strengthening perceptions of China as a power
that can legitimately pursue scientific advance in the Arctic.28

Additionally, **[[China gains leverage as a
responsible]{.underline}]{.mark}** fisheries [**[actor]{.underline}**
**[in the Arctic for the purposes of offsetting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[and/or distracting from [other contested
regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the very least**[, China establishes
the official position of the state]{.underline}**, **[which allows
Beijing to maintain a position that Chinese-involved]{.underline}**
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing **[violations are a
substate actor issue]{.underline}**. China's membership to the agreement
yields other three warfares benefits, too. Through a multitude of
working groups, task forces, and expert groups, **[[Beijing is able to
conduct influence operations targeting]{.mark} the bilateral and
multilateral [decision-making regimes that have positive psychological
and public opinion effects that promote China's near-Arctic state
narrative]{.mark}, [legitimize the PRC's participation in Arctic
affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}** as an important stakeholder, **[[and
shape the policy]{.mark} discussions to achieve Chinese
interests]{.underline}**.29 **[As far as]{.underline}** Chinese society
is concerned (public opinion), the regime is successfully fulling its
duties as required by the self-proclaimed Middle Kingdom. Contrary to
popular (Western) belief, **[[most Chinese are generally satisfied with
the geopolitical performance of Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
Arctic regional pursuits of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**---geopolitically---continue to **[[fit
within the larger national sentiment]{.mark} also]{.underline}**.
Lastly, China's strongest psychological warfare component geopolitically
manifests through its consistent use of "peace" overtones involving its
interests.30 Such a premise presents difficulties for competitors to
respond with counternarratives---by design. For the Arctic and its
notable characteristic of cooperation, China's "peaceful" pursuits could
be particularly problematic for the West.

**[[China's engagement in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** through the

**[[China's pursuit of great power status is drawing it to]{.mark} the

both **[[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Antarctic, **[China has

[**[have]{.underline}** **[elevated China's voice in polar

**[[Its growing]{.underline}]{.mark}** physical **[[footprint]{.mark} in
the world's most remote frontiers]{.underline}** also **[[serves to
advance China's broader strategic]{.mark}]{.underline}** and military
**[[interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In the Arctic, melting ice sheets present a host of significant
challenges for the global community. While leaders in Beijing are
clear-eyed about the threats posed by climate change, Chinese
strategists also see a potential silver lining.

**[The changing Arctic environment is expected to open new shipping
routes that could reduce transit times for seaborne trade and make it
easier for China to access the region's natural
resources]{.underline}**.

Yet without sovereign jurisdiction in the Arctic, China leans on
partnerships with other states to further its interests.

China has two permanent research stations in the region, one located in
Norway's Svalbard archipelago and the other in Iceland. Both sites
support a diverse range of research, from marine ecology to atmospheric
physics.

A third facility being utilized by China in northern Sweden is under
scrutiny due to suspected ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA),
jeopardizing China\'s access to the site.

Beijing faces mounting roadblocks elsewhere. Several Arctic
countries---including the United States---have voiced concerns about
China's presence in the region.

Left with few other options, China is stepping up its investments in
Russia as it looks to Moscow as its strategic partner of choice in the
Arctic.

This may prove to be China's best path forward as both the climate and
geopolitical competition heat up in the Arctic.

Arctic Aspirations

Despite being situated some 1,400 km (nearly 900 miles) south of the
Arctic circle, **[China has styled itself a "near-Arctic state" and
declared its ambitions to become a "polar great power"]{.underline}**
(极地强国) by 2030.

A 2018 Arctic policy white paper asserts that **[[developments in the
region have "a vital bearing" on China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and lays
out Beijing's vision for utilizing the region's natural resources and
shaping Arctic governance.

Beijing has sought to access the region largely through scientific and
commercial ventures, which officials claim give it the "right to speak"
on Arctic affairs.

While **[[China\'s Arctic research]{.underline}]{.mark}** is primarily
focused on advancing scientific knowledge---contributing to significant
discoveries related to sea ice composition, space weather, and marine
life---these accomplishments also [**[serve Beijing\'s broader strategic
objectives]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

**[[China sees the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** not as a strategic

United States needs more than ever its Arctic allies to closely monitor
the vast and changing Arctic environment, push back on Chinese
activities of concern, and maintain a regional governance system that
China is hoping to change some day to its benefit.

#### China has plenty of opportunities to grow its influence

**[[While Chinese investments]{.mark}]{.underline}** in infrastructure
and mining **[[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[may [face]{.mark}
growing [limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[the potential for
Chinese-Nordic collaboration in the Arctic
remains]{.underline}**]{.mark}, especially in non-security domains.
**[[Investment screenings are unlikely to prevent all Chinese
investment]{.mark} in "strategic" sectors]{.underline}**. Recent Chinese
investments in the battery sector in Finland and Sweden, while not in
the Arctic, underscore the challenges of reducing reliance on Chinese
investment, despite the EU's "de-risking" policy.

**[[Nordic collaboration with China]{.mark} in Arctic governance [is
likely to continue]{.mark}]{.underline}** and has potential benefits if
carefully managed and monitored. The absence of a single comprehensive
treaty governing Arctic affairs means that the current framework is a
patchwork of international agreements, forums and mechanisms, such as
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the UN
Fish Stock Convention and the Svalbard Treaty.64

**[China still has observer status in the Arctic Council]{.underline}**,
the primary intergovernmental forum for discussing environmental
protection and sustainable development in the Arctic, consisting of
representatives from the eight Arctic states and indigenous peoples.
While lacking voting rights, China is entitled to participate in
meetings, contribute to the work of the Council's various working groups
and propose projects through any of the eight member states.65 The
Council suspended activities in early March 2022, however, following a
collective decision by seven of the eight member states.66 This has left
the future of the council uncertain.

While there appears to be support among Nordic participants for keeping
China engaged in some aspects of Arctic governance, in particular
environmental governance, Nordic states should stay vigilant against any
attempts by China to modify Arctic governance mechanisms. Chinese
experts have consistently criticized these mechanisms as fragmented,
outdated and discriminatory against non-Arctic states, although they
rarely voice these concerns to international audiences.67 Nonetheless,
if China adheres to established regulations and norms of Arctic
governance, its participation could contribute to mitigating
environmental risks and improving maritime safety in the Arctic, while
potentially diluting the growing alliance between China and Russia in
the region.

**[[Arctic shipping is]{.mark} [an]{.mark}]{.underline}**other **[[area

**[[According to Chinese]{.mark} political [elites]{.mark}, [soft power

strategy]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[for China [to]{.mark} [cultivate a

continued growth' (Gao 2015, 7--8), thereby **[[enabling the CCP to
meet]{.mark} the [domestic]{.mark} and external role
[expectations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the domestic level, **[[Chinese
people expected the CCP to improve economic
development]{.underline}]{.mark}** and living standards, as well as
fight against corruption. **[Externally speaking, role expectations
linked to international community's calls for a more responsible China.
[The President]{.mark}]{.underline}** himself **[[recognised]{.mark} the
[soft power's potential when affirming that]{.mark}]{.underline}**[:
'**[We should increase China's soft power, give a good Chinese
narrative, and better communicate China's message to the
world]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[']{.underline}** (Cit. by Xinhuanet 2014,
para.4). Furthermore, there is the assumption that **[[soft power is a
constitutive aspect of a 'state's international status and
influence']{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and a 'tool for maintaining
advantageous positions in international competition']{.underline}**
(Shambaugh 2015, 22). Interestingly, as the next section will highlight,
the connection between the projection of soft power and the pursuit of a
distinctive status in the international arena has been, for a long time,
close to the heart of the EU.

#### Soft power is key to defuse threats to CCP legitimacy -- unites different factions and strengthens core values

Studies (Osamu, "China's Approach to Soft Power Seeking a Balance
between Nationalism, Legitimacy and International Influence,"
https://rusi.org/sites/default/files/201603_op_chinas_soft_power.pdf)

As China's rapid economic development has continued, economic inequality
has widened between its rich coastal cities and the poor rural interior.
There is a risk that anger and frustration among the poor might turn to
hostility towards the authority and legitimacy of China's rulers. In
this context, **[[Beijing]{.mark} wants to [use]{.mark} the elements of
Chinese [soft power]{.mark} [to promote national pride and]{.mark} the
[confidence]{.mark} of the whole population]{.underline}**.
**[Beijing]{.underline}** also **[wants to promote socialist thought
[and to unite the Chinese people]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in
commitment to the CCP and]{.mark} the [P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy]{.underline}**.
**[According]{.underline}** to the **[Chinese academic]{.underline}**
Zhang **[Guozuo]{.underline}**, 'The US sees soft power as an important
way of implementing hegemony and power politics. But **[[China
sees]{.mark} the improvement of cultural [soft power]{.mark} [as]{.mark}
[an important way of strengthening]{.mark} comprehensive national power
and [international influence']{.mark}]{.underline}**. He also argues
that, '**[internally, [soft power can strengthen socialist core values,
improve China's]{.mark} excellent [traditional culture,
cultivate]{.mark} noble thought and [morality, and strengthen
all-Party]{.mark}, all-[military]{.mark}, [and all-people's
unity']{.mark}]{.underline}**.23 This suggests that [**[China intends to
encourage domestic stability through its soft-power

**[[Governing regimes sustain]{.mark} political [legitimacy via]{.mark}
hard and [soft strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Because their
citizens often resent hard strategies]{.underline}** like inculcating
regime-preferred values via formal education and state-controlled
propaganda, such **[[regimes may engage in]{.mark}]{.underline}**
alternative **[[legitimacy-boosting approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
By telling riveting stories, memorializing historical events, restoring
cultural heritage, ritualizing political behavior, and visiting
monuments, governing regimes may cultivate soft strategies that
selectively frame, highlight, and dispense political information
(Gorsuch, 2007; McCracken, 2005; Meladze, 2021; Qian, 2020). Mass media
often institutionalize these discursive efforts. Assigning values---such
as patriotism, anti-imperialism, national independence, national honor,
political loyalty, and social responsibility---to heritage sites
transforms them into meaning vehicles for creating collective identity,
politicized consumption, and a shared community (Fayard, 2022; Hartmann
& Su, 2021; Jung & Mittal, 2020; McCracken, 2005; Mirrlees, 2016;
Pretes, 2003; Zhang et al., 2018).

**[[Soft strategies can enhance political legitimacy by allowing a
governing regime greater flexibility, persuasiveness, and courtesy in
ruling its citizenry]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Edney, 2015; Nye, 2004,
2011). Although limited media access can slow implementation, **[[soft
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** often **[[outperform hard
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in naturalizing state-favored
values]{.underline}**, meanings, symbols, and political ideologies
(Hollinshead & Suleman, 2017).

It is the latter dimension of soft power that is the focus of this
article. After Huang and Ding we argue that **[[soft power]{.mark}
operates through a feedback loop in which [states]{.mark} that [can
demonstrate policy 'success' to 'political
elites]{.mark}]{.underline}**, interest groups, and ... policy actors'
in other states provide the templates for those states (Huang and Ding
2006: 25). After Kurlantzick (2007) we argue that the success story of
the Chinese renewables sector provides both 'high' (aimed at a given
country's elites) and 'low' (aimed at the general population of that
country) soft power resources but in general it has been more
influential amongst political elites and policy communities than amongst
the general public, especially amongst elites in late industrialising
states (particularly autocratic states) where addressing the challenges
of environmental sustainability is increasingly important. In addition,
we argue that these **[[reputational processes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
also **[[enhance China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** negative or [**[domestic
soft power]{.underline}** **[in that it increases the credibility of the
state with its own citizens]{.underline}**]{.mark} (see Edney 2015; also

### I/L---Taiwan Diversion---2NC

#### Loss of legitimacy causes diversionary war and escalation. 

**Carter 19**, PhD, assistant professor at the School of International
Relations at the University of Southern California, where she is also a
Co-PI at the Lab on Non-Democratic Politics. (Erin Baggott Carter,
1-22-2019, \"Diversionary aggression in Chinese foreign policy,\"
*Brookings*,
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/diversionary-aggression-in-chinese-foreign-policy/)

In 2018 Xi Jinping shattered longstanding norms within the regime's
inner circle. In positioning himself to rule for life, Xi created
enemies among the ruling elite, who were already deeply displeased by
his politically motivated anti-corruption campaign.
**[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** now **[confronts]{.underline}** profound
**[threats from senior members of the elite]{.underline}**. His central
task is **[to survive them]{.underline}**. To do so, I argue, **[he will
craft a foreign policy that embraces diversionary
aggression]{.underline}**. That is, **[he [will
initiate]{.mark}]{.underline}** international
**[[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order **[[to build]{.mark} the
sort of public [nationalism that makes it difficult for elites to
challenge him]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The result will be a
more]{.mark} aggressive, [destabilizing]{.mark}, and unpredictable
[foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

China's "rise" is among the great challenges of the 21st century, in
part because **[China's domestic politics compel risky
behavior]{.underline}** on the international stage. Xi's attempts to
consolidate power have made diversionary foreign policy more likely, but
China's political system itself incentivizes this behavior. Indeed, my
research suggests that diversionary aggression may account for as much
as 40 percent of all conflict that the Chinese government initiates with
the United States.

It is critically important for U.S. policymakers to distinguish between
diversionary aggression, which evaporates with the resolution of China's
domestic tensions, and revisionist aggression, in which China seeks to
permanently reshape the strategic landscape in East Asia. For the United
States, **[[responding to diversion]{.underline}]{.mark}** as though it
were revision risks antagonizing China precisely when Xi is trying to
appear tough on foreigners. This **[[risks]{.mark} creating [a spiral
of]{.mark} escalating [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet responding
to revision as though it were diversion also carries risk: allowing
China to expand its influence in East Asia unchecked.

When does China employ diversionary aggression? How can U.S.
policymakers recognize it? And how should Washington respond?
Fortunately, China's diversionary aggression emanates at specific
moments and has key distinguishing features, which I discuss below.
Ultimately, the U.S. government should respond to diversion with
strategic restraint, and to revisionism with containment.

THE REASON

Why would tensions between Xi Jinping and senior government officials
compel the Chinese government to initiate conflicts with the United
States? Understanding this requires understanding **[[China's
domestic]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}, which [are]{.mark}
[competitive]{.mark}, factional, [and ubiquitous]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Deng Xiaoping ousted Mao's successor in a bloodless coup in 1978. The Bo
Xilai affair scandalized the regime in 2012. And today, **[[rumors of
assassination]{.mark} attempts against senior leaders [are
common]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Accordingly, **[Chinese presidents take
steps to insulate themselves from the conspiracies of regime
insiders.]{.underline}** This is how China's diversionary foreign policy
should be understood.

Scholars have long believed that **[autocrats can employ popular support
to inoculate themselves against elite conspiracies]{.underline}**. This
dynamic was first observed by Machiavelli, who wrote that "one of the
most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is
not to be hated and despised by the people." When a conspirator "can
only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to
take such a course."

Machiavelli's observation has special implications for China, where the
population is widely regarded as nationalist. **[[Citizens express high
support for the government in]{.mark} international [conflict
scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, **[when presented with a
hypothetical dispute over the Diaoyu Islands, Chinese survey respondents
overwhelmingly support not only Chinese defense of the islands against
Japan, but even]{.underline}** Chinese **[invasion]{.underline}** of the
islands. **[International [crises enable leaders to showcase their
competence and]{.mark} cue an "us-versus-them" dynamic that
[foster]{.mark}]{.underline}**s **[[national solidarity]{.mark}
and]{.underline}**, in turn, **[domestic support]{.underline}**.
**[[Domestic support protects Xi against]{.mark} dissatisfied
[elites]{.mark}, [who recognize]{.mark} that [toppling a popular leader
would invite]{.mark} a [backlash]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In short, **[diversionary aggression is an investment. [When elites are
dissatisfied, Xi can employ diversionary aggression to cue
nationalism]{.mark} among Chinese citizens [and]{.mark}]{.underline}**
so **[[inoculate himself]{.mark} from elite conspiracies]{.underline}**.

#### Reduced legitimacy causes the CCP to [embrace nationalism]{.underline}\-\--leads to war, draws in other major powers

**McKnight 15**, MA degree in international relations at the University
of San Diego, now a career naval aviator from the helicopter sea combat
(HSC) community. (Tyler, "Regime Legitimacy and the CCP,"
https://fliphtml5.com/vvok/jqha/Regime_Legitimacy_and_the_CCP/)

Perhaps **[the most]{.underline}** reasonable and **[likely path the CCP
will pursue to]{.underline}** **[[shore up]{.mark} its
[legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[is by [embracing
nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is a lot for the Chinese to be
proud of these days. They are a country that has risen from the ashes of
the Cultural Revolution to become the second largest economy in the
world. Most of the people of China no longer live a life of subsistence,
but one of material wealth. Many Chinese can now afford things that were
once considered luxury items such as televisions and cars. China has
firmly established itself as an economic power. China is now not only
economically strong, but also politically and militarily strong on the
international stage. After many years of subjugation, exploitation, and
humiliation at the hands of foreign powers China is now a strong nation.
China is powerful enough now to defend its borders against any potential
threat. Increasingly, China is also able to flex its muscles beyond its
own borders and territorial waters as exemplified by China's recent
establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the
disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. **[China's
ability to project power is quickly catching up with]{.underline}**
potential rivals such as **[Japan and the United States]{.underline}**.

The use of nationalism to support regime legitimacy is not a new concept
for the CCP. Since the late 1970s the CCP have been cultivating
nationalism as a way to compensate for the weaknesses of communist
ideology. After the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the "sanxin
weiji" (three spiritual crises) the CCP started using nationalism as a
way to establish a hegemonic order of political values and as a way to
rally popular support behind a less popular regime and its policies by
creating a sense of community. The CCP double downed on using
nationalism as a way to unite the country and reinforce its legitimacy
after the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Nationalism
was viewed as a way to counter Western liberal ideas and calls for
democracy. As the CCP did after the protest of 1989 and continues to do
today, the party continues to sell itself as the protector of the
Chinese people against foreign aggression. If the CCP were to allow
weakness, disunity, and disorder at home it would open a Pandora's box.
Such chaos would weaken China and give foreign aggressors the chance to
reassert themselves. With China's history of foreign exploitation, such
an argument can carry a lot of weight in China. China is once again a
strong country and it does not want to fall back into a role of
subjugation.xxiii

The problem with nationalism is it is a fickle beast. **[If the CCP were
to strongly embrace and [stoke nationalism, it would be hard to
contain]{.mark}]{.underline}** it. If **[the CCP]{.underline}** were to
define itself as the guardians of Chinese nationalism it **[would have
to work]{.underline}** hard **[to ensure it appeases the concerns of
nationalist. China continues to have]{.underline}** a number of
**[[festering territory disputes with]{.mark} its
neighbors:]{.underline}** the continued de facto independence of
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its border with **[India, and the
Senkaku]{.underline}**/Diaoyu **[islands]{.underline}** in the East
China Sea to name a few. With its history of foreign exploitation, China
is acutely sensitive to any territory dispute. **[The CCP would have a
very hard time maintaining]{.underline}** its **[nationalist credentials
if it were to allow other countries to assert control over
any]{.underline}** of the **[disputed areas]{.underline}**. The Chinese
leaders ran into this problem in the late 1990s when there was a
distinct rise in nationalism in China. The authors of the popular
**[nationalist]{.underline}** book The China That Can Say No were openly
critical of the Chinese government for taking a stance they viewed as
too soft towards the United States and Japan. They **[endorsed taking
action to [annex Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** at any cost
**[and]{.underline}** **[open confrontation with Japan and
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. A
move such as this would at best be risky considering China was, and
still is, dependent on Japan and the United States to ensure its
continued economic growth.xxiv

As a result of China's history of humiliation and the CCP's need to
strengthen its nationalist credentials, **[China is more likely than
other countries to [use]{.mark}]{.underline}** strong-arm tactics or
**[[force]{.mark} to assert itself.]{.underline}** **[Such moves are a
double-edged sword]{.underline}** for the CCP. **[They]{.underline}**
could **[help the CCP]{.underline}** to **[maintain]{.underline}** its
**[credentials as the guardians of the Chinese people]{.underline}**,
but this would be **[at the expense of]{.underline}** hurting its
standing in the international community, or worse, **[sending China on
path towards armed conflict.]{.underline}** **[When military units of
opposing countries are in close proximity]{.underline}** to each other
**[and tensions run high, it can be]{.underline}** very **[difficult to
prevent acts of aggression from [spilling over into armed
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[Posturing on one side can
be viewed as an [imminent]{.mark} intent to
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the other. China will have to balance
a fine line to ensure their actions are not viewed as too soft at home
or overly aggressive by the international community. If the CCP relies
heavily on nationalism to strengthen its legitimacy and it is viewed too
soft at home, it will hurt the staying power of the regime. **[If China
is viewed as too aggressive by its neighbors, it could
face]{.underline}** reduced foreign investment, sanctions, or worse,
**[[armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. All of which would also hurt
the economic growth of China and as a result damage the legitimacy of
the regime.

#### Chinese political instability leads to [nuclear war]{.underline}. [Loose nukes]{.underline} and [Taiwan]{.underline}. 

**David 8**, Professor of IR @ Johns Hopkins (Stephen, "Catastrophic
Consequences: Civil Wars and American Interests," p. 116-121)

While some American policymakers would greet the prospect of **[a
[China]{.mark} mired in [internal conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** with
relief, a crippled China **[presents]{.underline}** its own threats to
American interests, **[threats]{.underline}** that **[are]{.underline}**
in many ways **[more dire than those posed by a rising
China.]{.underline}** American and Chinese economies have become closely
inter- twined with huge amounts of American investment in China and even
larger Chinese purchases of American bonds. If domestic unrest
undermines this relationship, any hope of China becoming prosperous
would be dashed, while the American economy would be throw n into
recession ---or worse. **[China is a great power]{.underline}** with a
population of 1.3 billion people, bordering on 14 countries. **[Its
collapse would threaten the stability of close American allies such as
South Korea and Japan, create opportunities for mischief by Russia and
North Korea, and produce a humanitarian catastrophe unprecedented in
world history.]{.underline}** **[Should China choose to stave off
internal unrest through aggressive actions against Taiwan, prospects for
a Sino-American military confrontation become all too
real]{.underline}**. Precisely because China needs good relations with
its neighbors and the United States to continue on its path of economic
growth, there is reason to hope that the Chinese leadership would not
deliberately opt for bellicose policies. **[If China is wracked with
instability]{.underline}**, however, **[Chinese leaders may not be able
to control what happens within and outside their borders, endangering
key]{.underline}** American **[concerns]{.underline}**.

Understanding the consequences of a failing China for the United States
re- quires first grasping why a stable China is so important to American
concerns. As will be seen, China plays a central role in American
economic and strategic interests. Why China, despite its seeming
prosperity and progress, may fall victim to civil unrest is then
examined. Unlike Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico, China forces us to
confront what the collapse of a great power would be like. Far from a
welcome occurrence, **[the implications]{.underline}** of such an event
**[are potentially [catastrophic]{.mark} for]{.underline}** America,
China\'s Asian neighbors, and **[the world]{.underline}** community.

American Interests in China The United States cares about what happens
in China, because **[America\'s prosperity]{.underline}** and well-being
**[rests on China remaining stable]{.underline}**. China is the second
largest trading partner of the United States (after Canada ), a
relationship whose **[disruption would be disastrous for both
countries]{.underline}**. **[The low cost of Chinese exports has kept
inflation down in the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
while delighting consumers with S40 DVD players and S20 digital cameras.
These benefits, while highly visible, pale in comparison to the critical
role played by Chinese purchases of American securities. China holds
over one trillion dollars in foreign reserves, one of the largest
holders of such reserves in the world. Because China exports so much and
imports so little, it accumulates huge amounts of dollars. This would
normally cause the Chinese currency (yuan) to gain in value, thus
reducing its exports and its mammoth reserves. To preserve its critical
export sector, however, China has not allowed the yuan to float freely
and instead has kept its value relatively constant by buying dollars to
the tune of S20 billion per month, ensuring that its reserves will
continue to grow. Approximately 707c of these reserves are in U.S.
dollars, with the great majority in U.S. treasury bonds, widely seen as
the most secure investment one can make, since they are backed in full
by the American government. A major reason why **[interest
rates]{.underline}** in the United States **[have been kept
low]{.underline}** is **[because China buys]{.underline}** so many of
these **[bonds. These low interest rates are central to the health of
the American economy]{.underline}**, fostering economic expansion and
high home prices. The housing market is especially critical, as it has
been the major engine of growth for the American economy over the past
several years, as homeowners (many of whom have saved little) borrow
against the ever rising values of their houses, stimulating the economy
with their robust consumer spending. If China stops buying American
treasury bonds or dramatically slows down their purchase, American
interest rates would need to increase in order to attract other buyers,
making business expansion more costly , houses much more expensive, and
dramatically cutting consumer spending.\'

China displayed its economic clout the day after the Democrats won
control over both houses of Congress in November 2006, when the head of
China\'s central bank declared that the Bank would diversify more of its
reserves into nondollar currencies. This prompted an immediate worldwide
sell-off of American dollars, which dramatically cut the dollar\'s
value. If such a seemingly benign announcement could produce this
effect, one shudders to think of the impact of a major Chinese sell-off
of American bonds on the United States.4 Some have taken solace in the
view that Chinese self-interest would prevent Beijing from acting in
ways that would harm the American economy. If, for example, China halted
its purchase of American securities, China too would suffer as the value
of the bonds in its possession would also decrease. **[If China is
convulsed with domestic disorder]{.underline}**, however, **[it would be
unable to purchase the American bonds, plunging the U.S. economy into
crisis]{.underline}**.

An unstable China also presents major strategic concerns for the United
States. Since the death of Mao in 1976, China has largely cooperated
with the United States on key foreign policy goals. China has been a
prime player in talks with North Korea, striving to contain the damage
done by Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons. In part because of
China's concerns about its own Islamic minority, Beijing has worked with
Washington after 9/11 to confront terrorism. China has become a major
international player in the United Nations, contributing more troops to
peacekeeping missions around the world than any other Security Council
member. 5 With Washington's endorsement, China joined the World Trade
Organization, where it is expected to play a major role in lowering
tariffs and establishing rules for free trade that the world (and it)
will follow.

To be sure, the United States and China do not agree on everything. The
United States is concerned about China\'s lack of democracy, overlooking
of human rights abuses in Darfur and elsewhere, border disputes with its
neighbors, close ties with Iran, and continuing claims to Taiwan.
Nevertheless, in a world increasingly divided between those fostering
terror and instability and those seeking to maintain order and enhance
prosperity, China clearly belongs in the latter camp, much to America\'s
relief. If China is beset by internal disorder, however, there is no
telling what kind of regime might emerge in its wake. The brutal civil
war in China in the late 1940s gave birth to an equally brutal
government that made life miserable for its neighbors and America for
decades. **[A twenty-first-century civil war could well bring about the
emergence of a hostile, expansionist China that, armed with [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** and a strong economy, **[posed an even
greater threat to]{.underline}** American interests and **[world
stability]{.underline}** than its Maoist predecessor.

**[A strong China is necessary to preserve Asian
stability]{.underline}**, a vital interest of the United States. The
prosperity of Asian nations is directly linked to the surging Chinese
economy. In the 1990s, Asian nations produced goods largely for
non-Asian countries, particularly the United States. By 2005, more than
half of all regional exports were to other states in the region, with
China the most likely destination. China is the number one trading
partner of such Asian powerhouses as South Korea and Japan, both of
which now provide more direct investment to China (over S5 billion per y
ear) than even the United States.6 Moreover, China has emerged as the
major player in Asian multilateral organizations, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
(APEC). None of these organizations could meet their goals of fostering
economic and political interdependence without the active cooperation of
China. **[Insofar as economic interdependence and international
institutions promote peace and security, the continued economic growth
and stability of China is essential for Asia]{.underline}**.

The importance of a stable China to American strategic interests is best
seen by considering what might happen **[if China
unraveled]{.underline}**. One of the first consequences would be
millions of refugees pouring from China's borders, unsettling its
neighbors. **[The stability of key American allies such as Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan would be severely tested as they try to cope
with]{.underline}** this massive human flow along with **[the economic
shockwaves of China\'s dissolution]{.underline}**. Nor would the United
States be immune, as mam Chinese may take advantage of corrupt officials
or professional human smugglers (\"snakeheads\') to make their way to
America\'s shores. **[North Korea]{.underline}**, unpredictable under
normal circumstances, **[may flex its military muscle]{.underline}**
along its borders with China and South Korea, **[[with dreadful
results]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Ethnic minorities in provinces such
as Tibet and Xinjiang might seize the moment to attempt to break
away]{.underline}** from Beijing\'s domination, fostering even greater
instability. **[China\'s control of its]{.underline}** more than 200
**[[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, usually very
secure, **[may be compromised, with the arms]{.underline}** eventually
**[falling into unknown hands]{.underline}**. The **[territorial
disputes]{.underline}** that China has **[with Russia]{.underline}**,
Vietnam, **[India, and others could well degenerate into [armed
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[as China loses control over its own
military forces]{.underline}** and its neighbors seek to take advantage
of its internal strife. As Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping remarked
(following the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations), the collapse of Chinese
rule would have terrible effects that would go far beyond China\'s
borders: \"And if a civil war broke out, with blood flowing like a
river, what \'human rights\' would there be? If civil war broke out in
China, with each faction dominating a region, production declining,
transportation disrupted and not millions or tens of millions but
hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing the country, it is the
Asia-Pacific region, which is at present the most promising in the
world, that would be the first affected. And that would lead to disaster
on a world scale.\"9 While Deng may have had reason to exaggerate the
effects of the toppling of the Chinese regime, his concerns ring true.

**[American relations]{.underline}** with China **[would be severely
damaged in the wake of Chinese unrest.]{.underline}** **[The Chinese
regime might single out the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[as an enemy in order to stifle civil strife
by fostering anti-American nationalism]{.underline}**. **[If China
violently suppressed protests]{.underline}**, as it did during the 1989
Tiananmen demonstrations, the American **[Congress might retaliate with
economic sanctions, further escalating tensions]{.underline}** between
China and the United States. Especially if China takes actions against
groups favored by the United States, such as Chi- nese Christians, the
American leadership is likely to react harshly against Beijing. Chinese
leaders already worry about the United States exploiting internal unrest
to remove them from power. Actual American support of insurgent groups
even if it is confined to expressions of sympathy, could be taken as a
sign that Washington had joined with the rebels, throwing Sino-American
relations into crisis. **[China would very quickly turn from an
erstwhile ally into a superpower adversary]{.underline}**.

The deterioration of the American relationship with China would be
especially dangerous regarding Taiwan. Under the best of circumstances,
Taiwan presents a flash point in the Chinese-American relationship.
China\'s claims that Taiwan is a renegade province belonging to the
People\'s Republic fly in the face of America\'s commitment to protect
Taiwan, a democratic and prosperous ally. **[So long as Taiwan does not
declare its independence, the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China can agree to disagree about
Taiwan\'s future, but should internal unrest engulf China, this uneasy
and informal accommodation could unravel]{.underline}**. **[If China
falls victim to widespread instability, the pressure to act against
[Taiwan would be enormous]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It would give China
the excuse to impose martial law, improving its abilities to suppress
any budding revolt. China\'s claims to Taiwan enjoy near unanimous
approval among the Chinese people. **[Acting against Taiwan would enable
the Chinese leadership to fan the flames of nationalism]{.underline}**,
one of the few means at its disposal to rally support for an otherwise
illegitimate regime.\"

**[A Sino-Taiwanese confrontation could also come about inadvertently if
the Chinese leadership decided to provoke a crisis over Taiwan only to
find itself at war as popular emotions prevented a peaceful
resolution]{.underline}** of the crisis. If a Taiwanese leader decided
to exploit Chinese unrest by declaring independence, the Chinese
government might have no choice but to launch an attack. As the
political scientist Susan Shirk argues, no Chinese regime can stand
aside and allow Taiwan to announce its independence without going to war
if it expects to survive in power.12 Whether through miscalculation or
brinksmanship, **[war with Taiwan producing a Sino-American
confrontation could well be the unintended out- come of Chinese civil
conflict]{.underline}**.

China is well prepared to take forceful action against Taiwan if it
decides to do so. China has been constantly upgrading its air and sea
capabilities for a possible invasion across the Straits of Taiwan. 13 If
China chooses not to invade, it could launch the hundreds of ballistic
missiles deployed on its coast against Taiwan or it could blockade its
two principal ports. Given that Taiwan is critically dependent on
foreign trade (75% of its GDP) and imports of fuel for energy
consumption (95% of its energy needs come from outside the country),
either of these actions would cripple the island state. 14 It is
difficult to see the United States remaining indifferent to a brutal
assault against one of its allies. Perhaps most worrisome, we simply do
not know all of the effects that the collapse of China would bring. The
prospect of civil unrest in China threatens an existing great power
poised perhaps to become the major power of the twenty-first century.
**[The impact of civil conflict in China cannot be isolated to one or a
handful of consequences. As seen in the French Revolution]{.underline}**
of 1789-- 1799 **[and the Russian Civil War]{.underline}** of 1918--
1920, **[great powers do not suffer civil violence quietly, or
alone]{.underline}**. **[Given China's central role in the world
economy]{.underline}**, enormous population, **[[nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and growing international influence,
**[the unraveling of China cannot help but be [shatter]{.mark}ing for
[the world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Change can be beneficial, and the
weakening of a prospective superpower competitor would be celebrated in
some American quarters. Nevertheless, an uncontrolled, cataclysmic
transformation in China would threaten American interests as much as, if
not more than, the purposeful designs of Maoist China a generation ago.

**[A]{.underline}** second **[[significant area of interest]{.mark} for
US national security officials [regarding Chinese political stability
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** the US's somewhat ambiguous alliance with the
island of **[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 1979, the US government
formally recognized the Beijing government in China and broke formal
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but in order to legalize continued arms
sales to the island, the United States wrote and passed the Taiwan
Relations Act later that year. 190 **[The Taiwan Relations Act, which is
still an active document in US foreign policy today, essentially states
that the US is committed to a peaceful Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}**
Officially, the United States has largely maintained a strategy of
'strategic ambiguity' toward the island, stating that the United States
would defend Taiwan from invasion by the Chinese but would not protect
Taiwan if they provoked an attack. 191 **[[Chaos in the Taiwan Strait
caused by]{.mark}]{.underline}** a period of **[[political instability
in China could mean the PLA]{.mark} could [take that opportunity to
invade Taiwan and officially re-claim it for the mainland]{.mark}. It is

between the US and Taiwan,]{.underline}** however 'ambiguous', **[that

Movements,\" Yale Journal of International Affairs 16, pg. 81-82,
https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/yaljoina16&i=74)

**[It is reasonable to speculate that Beijing employed diversionary
behavior in 2019]{.underline}** to distract from possible instability in
three important pillars of Beijing\'s legitimacy: a growing economy,
social stability, and nationalism. Partially due to the trade conflicts
with the United States, China\'s economic growth dropped to the lowest
level since 1992, and its Gross Domestic Product\'s growth in 2019 was
only 6.11 percent, compared with 7.43 percent in 2014.25 Meanwhile,
Beijing also initiated a \"crackdown on gang crime\" movement in China
that started in early 2018. This was a part of the Chinese Communist
Party\'s (CCP) effort to strengthen its legitimacy.26 However, this
campaign against gang crime also put pressure on the local government to
maintain social stability. Furthermore, 2019 was the thirtieth
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square incident, which is a highly
sensitive issue in mainland China. It would be dangerous for Beijing if
this infamous incident resonated with the social movements in Hong Kong
or stimulated dissatisfaction or protests in mainland China. Therefore,
**[[to avoid]{.mark} potential [unrest]{.mark} due to other issues [and
divert]{.mark} public [attention]{.mark} away from them, [stimulating
nationalism is a wise]{.mark} and easy [way for Beijing to manipulate
public opinion]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

If the diversionary nationalism tactic really works, then we may expect
a \"rally around the flag\" sentiment to emerge. **[Based on social
identity theory, international conflicts lead to a strong feeling of
in-group and out-group contrasts, where people are more in favor of
in-group members.2]{.underline}**7 **[This support of in-group members
leads to support for the political leader of this group]{.underline}**.
For instance, Russian President Vladimir **[[Putin\'s support rose
dramatically after]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russia\'s seizure of
**[[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, U.S. President Frankdin **[Roosevelt
gained a 12 percent increase in approval after]{.underline}** the attack
on **[Pearl Harbor]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** U.S. President
George W. **[Bush gained a 39 percent increase after]{.underline}** the
**[9/11]{.underline}** attacks. 28 Moreover, **[[conflicts]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} great [opportunities for leaders to prove their]{.mark}
leadership power and [competence]{.mark}. When leaders]{.underline}**
display unjustified behavior or **[fail, [it is common for]{.mark} those
[leaders to revitalize public support through]{.mark} promoting
international [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**.29

**[The [survey results]{.mark} from my 160-person sample
[indicate]{.mark} that there [is a strong nationalist sentiment
among]{.mark} young [Chinese citizens and that]{.mark} the [overemphasis
on foreign intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}** and violence, which
presumably leads to nationalist emotions, **[[does arouse greater
support for Beijing and its leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[Support for Beijing, which reflects the \"rally around the flag
effect,\"]{.underline}** also **[rose after]{.underline}** the
**[protests]{.underline}**. In total, 87 of the 156 respondents(55.77
percent) claimed rising confidence in the CCP.30 Only 9.62 percent of
respondents had less confidence. Notably, 34.62 percent of the
respondents felt no different before and after this movement. In terms
of support for leaders, four of the respondents did not answer this
question due to the potential risks: some of them said, \"I have to say
yes, right?\" This may have resulted in biased answers for these two
questions. In total 47.37 percent of the respondents agreed that they
have more confidence in their leaders, whereas 13.81 percent disagreed.
This is slightly less supportive than the support for the party.

**[[w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction --
[instability is very bad]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

China's current ruler, the autocratic President Xi Jinping, has
taken more power for himself than any Chinese leader since Mao. Under
these conditions, he gets all the credit when things go well. 

When they go badly, as they have in China since 2019, Xi gets the blame.
In turn, Xi has had to increase his political power even more to prevent
himself from being overthrown. 

To distract his people from his own failures, then, **[[Xi
is]{.mark} increasingly [belligerent]{.mark} with his
neighbors]{.underline}**---especially Taiwan. It is logical to assume
that **[[the more the]{.mark} Chinese [economy collapses]{.mark}, the
[more likely it is]{.mark} that [China will risk
war]{.mark}]{.underline}** with its neighbors.

Beyond that, though, **[[if things get]{.mark} really
[bad]{.mark}]{.underline}** in China for **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Jinping, he **[[could be ousted]{.underline}]{.mark}** by a rival cadre
of CCP leaders. 

This could mean a far more competent Chinese Communist leader takes
charge. 

Or, as happened at the end of the Qing Dynasty, various **[factions
could arise]{.underline}** following Xi's ouster, basically **[[creating
a]{.mark} multi-sided [civil war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Now, imagine
China's disastrous Warlord Period, but **[[with nukes

**Weiss 22**, PhD, Professor of Government @ Cornell. (Jessica Chen, *et
al*, "Provocation, Public Opinion, and International Disputes: Evidence
from China," *International Studies Quarterly*, Volume 66, Issue 2, p.
4-5)

Provocation in an Authoritarian Context: China

The phenomenon of provocation does not appear to be unique to any
particular regime type, with both democratic and authoritarian leaders
publicly condemning or warning against foreign "provocations." For
instance, US officials told Chinese leaders that "We would consider an
ADIZ \[in the South China Sea\] ... a provocative and destabilizing act
which would automatically raise tensions" (Reuters Staff 2016). The
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak ordered plans to attack a North
Korean missile base upon "any indication of further provocation" (Lee
2010).

Since most militarized conflicts involve at least one nondemocracy, it
is important to understand whether and what kinds of foreign actions are
likely to provoke public pressure for tough action in an authoritarian
context. **[Monitoring and responding to [public sentiment have become
increasingly critical to authoritarian leaders, who fear]{.mark} that
popular [unrest]{.mark} [may trigger elite splits or]{.mark} even
[ouster from office]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since the end of the Cold
War, **[elite coups have been eclipsed by popular protests as the modal
means of ousting nondemocratic leaders]{.underline}** (Kendall-Taylor
and Frantz 2014). Formally, **[the risk of incurring popular wrath may
impose a "revolution constraint" on]{.underline}** the policies that
**[authoritarian leaders]{.underline}** are willing to adopt (Acemoglu
and Robinson 2006, 120). As President Xi explained to visiting
dignitaries from Taiwan: "The Communist Party would be overthrown by the
people if the pro-independence issue was not dealt with" (Zhuang 2016).
**[Even if authoritarian elites do not fear popular revolt, public
[dissatisfaction may embolden]{.mark} regime [insiders to]{.mark} oppose
or [challenge]{.mark} the [leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}** in an
attempt **[to reclaim popular legitimacy]{.underline}** (Shirk 2007;
Svolik 2012, 12; Wallace 2013). **[The]{.underline}** apparent
**[importance of public support]{.underline}** in China **[was evident
in [Xi's statement]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the Central Committee
**[that]{.underline}** "**[Winning or losing [public
support]{.mark}]{.underline}** is an issue that **[[concerns the CPC's
survival or extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Xinhua 2013).

**[Given its fears of losing popular support and emboldening elite
dissent, the Chinese government has invested in monitoring and
responding to public sentiment]{.underline}** and demands (Manion 2015;
Chen, Pan, and Xu 2016; Truex 2016; Meng, Pan, and Yang 2017). **[Even
without electoral accountability]{.underline}**, "**[local service
institutions in China are comparably responsive to]{.underline}**
similar institutions in **[democracies]{.underline}**" (Distelhorst and
Hou 2017, 1024). **[[Chinese officials do not risk punishment at]{.mark}
the [polls]{.mark}, [but]{.mark}]{.underline}** they may **[still
[adjust policies to]{.mark}]{.underline}** respond to or **[anticipate
citizen demands, [reduc]{.mark}ing [risks of]{.mark} collective action
and elite [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**.9

We focus on the attitudes and reactions of citizens in China for two
reasons. First, Chinese foreign policy has substantive importance.
**[[If a new great power war occurs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there is a
good chance that **[[it would be over sovereignty and maritime issues in
the Asia-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Allison 2015). Second, despite
many differences in size, power, and history, Chinese reactions to
international crises can help us understand the incentives and pressures
that other authoritarian states face, just as scholars studying US
foreign policy can shed light on democratic behavior in international
relations.

Do foreign actions actually "hurt the feelings" of the Chinese public,
increasing popular indignation, resolve, and disapproval of the
government if it fails to stand tough? Chinese diplomats claim to
receive unsolicited mail from citizens containing calcium pills, an
implied demand to "show more backbone in standing up against the United
States" (Shirk 2007, 101). At least some foreign officials have pointed
to the pressure that public opinion exerts on Chinese foreign policy. As
the former Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg notes with Michael
O'Hanlon, "In China, rising national pride and memories of past
humiliations put increased pressure on leaders not to compromise with
foreigners, including Americans ... **[[The Communist Party is
especially susceptible to]{.mark} these [pressures, given its dependence
on nationalist credentials]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Steinberg and
O'Hanlon 2014, 25).

"Where Would Beijing Use External Distractions?" *The Diplomat*,
http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/where-would-beijing-use-external-distractions/)

Throughout history, embattled **[[governments]{.mark} have [often
resorted to external distractions to tap into a restive population's
nationalist sentiment]{.mark} and thereby release, or [redirect,
pressures]{.mark} that otherwise could have been [turned against those
in power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Authoritarian regimes in particular,
which deny their citizens the right to punish the authorities through
retributive democracy --- that is, elections --- have used this device
to ensure their survival during periods of domestic upheaval or
financial crisis. Would the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), whose
legitimacy is so contingent on social stability and economic growth, go
down the same path if it felt that its hold on power were threatened by
domestic instability? Building on the premise that the many
contradictions that are inherent to the extraordinarily complex Chinese
experiment, and rampant corruption that undermines stability, will
eventually catch up with the CCP, we can legitimately ask how, and
where, **[[Beijing]{.mark} could [manufacture external crises with
opponents]{.mark} against whom nationalist fervor]{.underline}**, a
major characteristic of contemporary China, **[can be channeled. In past
decades, the CCP has]{.underline}** on several occasions **[tapped into
public outrage to distract a disgruntled population, often by
encouraging]{.underline}** (and when necessary containing) **[protests
against external opponents, namely Japan and the United
States]{.underline}**. While serving as a convenient outlet, domestic
protests, even when they turned violent (e.g., attacks on Japanese
manufacturers), were about as far as the CCP would allow. This
self-imposed restraint, which was prevalent during the 1980s, 1990s and
2000s, was a function both of China's focus on building its economy
(contingent on stable relations with its neighbors) and perceived
military weakness. Since then, China has established itself as the
world's second-largest economy and now deploys, thanks to more than a
decade of double-digit defense budget growth, a first-rate modern
military. Those impressive achievements have, however, fueled Chinese
nationalism, which has increasingly approached the dangerous zone of
hubris. For many, China is now a rightful regional hegemon demanding
respect, which if denied can --- and should --- be met with threats, if
not the application of force. While it might be tempting to attribute
China's recent assertiveness in the South and East China Seas to the
emergence of Xi Jinping, Xi alone cannot make all the decisions;
nationalism is a component that cannot be dissociated from this new
phase in Chinese expressions of its power. As then-Chinese foreign
minister Yang Jiechi is said to have told his counterparts at a tense
regional forum in Hanoi in 2010, "There is one basic difference among
us. China is a big state and you are smaller countries." **[This
newfound assertiveness]{.underline}** within its backyard thus **[makes
it more feasible that, in times of serious trouble]{.underline}** at
home, **[the Chinese leadership could seek to deflect]{.underline}**
potentially **[destabilizing anger by exploiting some external
distraction]{.underline}**. Doing so is always a calculated risk, and
sometimes the gambit fails, as Slobodan Milosevic learned the hard way
when he tapped into the furies of nationalism to appease mounting public
discontent with his bungled economic policies. For an external
distraction to achieve its objective (that is, taking attention away
from domestic issues by redirecting anger at an outside actor), it must
not result in failure or military defeat. In other words, except for the
most extreme circumstances, such as the imminent collapse of a regime,
the decision to externalize a domestic crisis is a rational one:
adventurism must be certain to achieve success, which in turn will
translate into political gains for the embattled regime. Risk-taking is
therefore proportional to the seriousness of the destabilizing forces
within. Rule No. 1 for External Distractions: **[The [greater]{.mark}
the [domestic instability]{.mark}, the [more risks a regime]{.mark} will
be willing to [take]{.mark}]{.underline}**, given that the scope and,
above all, the symbolism of the victory in an external scenario must
also be greater. **[With this in mind, we can then ask which [external
distraction scenarios]{.mark} would Beijing be the [most likely]{.mark}
to turn to should domestic disturbances compel it to do
so.]{.underline}** That is not to say that anything like this will
happen anytime soon. It is nevertheless not unreasonable to imagine such
a possibility. The intensifying crackdown on critics of the CCP, the
detention of lawyers, journalists and activists, unrest in Xinjiang,
random acts of terrorism, accrued censorship --- all point to growing
instability. What follows is a very succinct (and by no means
exhaustive) list of disputes, in descending order of likelihood, which
Beijing could use for external distraction. **[1. [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea The South China Sea]{.underline}**, an area
where China is embroiled in several territorial disputes with smaller
claimants, **[is ripe for exploitation as an external
distraction]{.underline}**. Nationalist sentiment, along with the sense
that the entire body of water is part of China's indivisible territory
and therefore a "core interest," are sufficient enough to foster a will
to fight should some "incident," timed to counter unrest back home,
force China to react. Barring a U.S. intervention, which for the time
being seems unlikely, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has both the
numerical and qualitative advantage against any would be opponent or
combination thereof. The Philippines and Vietnam, two countries which
have skirmished with China in recent years, are the likeliest candidates
for external distractions, as the costs of a brief conflict would be low
and the likelihood of military success fairly high. For a quick
popularity boost and low-risk distraction, these opponents would best
serve Beijing's interests. **[2. [Jammu and Kashmir]{.mark}, Arunachal
Pradesh Although Beijing claims that it is ready for a settlement of its
longstanding territorial disputes with India, the areas remain ripe for
the re-ignition of conflict]{.underline}**. New Delhi accuses China of
occupying 38,000 square kilometers in Jammu and Kashmir, and Beijing
lays claim to more than 90,000 square kilometers of territory inside the
Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. A few factors militate against the
suitability of those territories for an external distraction, chief
among them the difficult access in winter, and the strength of the
Indian military, which would pose a greater risk to PLA troops than
those of Vietnam or the Philippines in the previous scenario.
Nevertheless, **[memories of China's routing of the Indian military in
the Sino-Indian War of 1962 could [embolden
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Though challenging, the PLA would be
expected to prevail in a limited conflict with Indian forces, and China
would have taken on a greater regional power than Vietnam or the
Philippines, with everything that this entails in terms of political
benefits back home.

**[[In]{.underline}]{.mark}** the event of **[a US-China [war over
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[there are plausible scenarios in which
[either China or the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[would]{.mark} logically [consider
using nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}**lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in a limited fashion, given the high stakes. Limited nuclear use is
defined as a nuclear attack short of a large-scale nuclear exchange
designed to eliminate a large fraction of an adversary state's military
forces, industrial production, or population. This section will lay out
the plausible scenarios for either side's deliberate nuclear use across
the spectrum of employment---from signaling to an attack on an
operationally relevant target to an extended nuclear exchange.

Scenarios for Chinese Limited Nuclear First Use

There are at least four scenarios for Chinese limited nuclear first use
in a conflict with the United States over Taiwan: nuclear signaling and
threats, a nuclear demonstration with no military effect, a nuclear
attack on Taiwan, or a nuclear attack on the forces or territory of the
United States or one or more of its regional allies.

Some might respond that these scenarios are implausible, given China's
pledge not to use nuclear weapons first in a conflict, but **[there are
reasons to doubt China's stated policy]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[[China's]{.mark} nuclear [strategy]{.mark} plausibly [permits]{.mark}
a variety of [nuclear uses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and the country
unequivocally possesses the capability to conduct a nuclear first
strike. Moreover, US statements and **[[documents cast doubt on]{.mark}
China's
[n]{.mark}]{.underline}**o-**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst-**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se
**[policy]{.underline}**.20 In addition, **[[policy can change
in]{.mark} the midst of [a crisis]{.mark} or conflict]{.underline}**,
**[and [there is]{.mark}]{.underline}** technically **[[nothing
about]{.underline}]{.mark}** China's nuclear
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommand **[[and
c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ontrol **[[that would prohibit first
use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States must plan against this
possibility.

Signaling

In a crisis or a conflict over Taiwan, **[Chinese [leadership might
use]{.mark} nuclear [signaling to stop]{.mark} or limit a US
[intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This signaling could take a
variety of forms. **[Chinese leadership or state media could issue
threats]{.underline}**---vague or specific, public or private---**[that
warn of]{.underline}** "**[catastrophic consequences]{.underline}**" for
the United States if it interfered with Chinese "internal matters."
**[The Chinese military could visibly alert its nuclear
forces]{.underline}**, including by dispatching mobile missiles from
garrison, dispersing bombers to different airfields, and perhaps even
releasing warheads from central storage to operational units. **[China
could also test its nuclear delivery vehicles]{.underline}**. This could
be through a routine test like an intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM) launch in its western test ranges. China could perhaps also test
a new capability, like its August 2021 test of a boost-glide hypersonic
missile with fractional orbital bombardment capability, which reportedly
took US defense officials by surprise and was "very close" to a "Sputnik
moment" in the words of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark
Milley.21 Perhaps interpreting Russian nuclear threats against Ukraine
as successful in dissuading direct US and NATO intervention, China could
believe that raising the salience of nuclear weapons would deter the
United States and its allies from joining the war on Taiwan's side.

Demonstration

The Chinese military could conduct a nuclear demonstration. It could
take a step up from nuclear signaling by actually detonating a nuclear
device without having direct military effects. The least provocative
demonstration would be a test at an existing Chinese test range. China
has not conducted a nuclear weapons test since its 1996 signature of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which it has not ratified. The purpose of
such a test would aim to convince Taiwanese, US, and allied governments
and publics of China's seriousness about the conflict and its
willingness to escalate to nuclear use. A more provocative nuclear
demonstration could occur above the waters surrounding Taiwan or perhaps
even above international waters in the vicinity of a US military base in
the Western Pacific.

Nuclear Attack on Taiwan

**[A nuclear [attack against Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** itself
**[could [target]{.mark} Taiwanese [military or leadership]{.mark}
facilities]{.underline}**---possibly before the United States has
committed troops to Taiwan's defense---**[[as a gambit]{.mark} to
collapse Taiwan's defenses]{.underline}**, **[decapitate its
leadership]{.underline}**, **[and deter]{.underline}** the United States
and its **[allies from supporting Taiwan]{.underline}**. In recent
years, experts have recommended that Taiwan transform its military into
a distributed force capable of a "porcupine defense" less vulnerable to
air and missile bombardment. Still, **[there are significant
[Taiwanese]{.mark} military [facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** (air
bases, ports, and army bases) **[or naval vessels that might [present
attractive targets]{.mark} for a nuclear attack]{.underline}**. The
Chinese military could use nuclear weapons to strike some of these
facilities with minimal collateral damage to the Taiwanese populace or
economy. By contrast, **[[China could also consider a
decapitating]{.mark} nuclear [strike]{.mark} against Taiwanese national
leadership in Taipei]{.underline}** or against Taiwanese
continuity-of-government locations. The goal of these attacks would be,
first, to collapse Taiwanese government and, second, to signal to the
Taiwanese population and the wider world that China is willing to
escalate to the highest levels to achieve its goal of conquering Taiwan.
A strike against an urban center would bring especially grave diplomatic
and reputational repercussions for China and damage the postwar value of
Taiwan to Beijing.

In either instance, a nuclear strike could be carried out before the
United States or other countries had committed forces to the conflict,
presenting those nations with the difficult choice of declaring war on a
China that had already demonstrated its willingness to use nuclear
weapons to prevail.

Nuclear Attack on US Forces, Allies, or Territory

Territory China could use nuclear weapons against US or allied forces or
territory if it judged that nuclear use could confer a significant
advantage.

**[If the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies
and partners **[did decide to come to the aid of Taiwan with military
force]{.underline}**, **[[China could]{.mark} elect to [use
nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}**lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a
limited way **[[against US]{.mark} or allied [forces]{.mark}, US
military [facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the territory of allies
engaged in the fight, **[[or]{.mark} even US
[territory]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Targets for nuclear use could include
US or allied forces in the region, such as US carrier strike groups or
surface action groups. A Chinese response might also include attacks on
US military facilities located on the territory of allies, such as
Kadena Air Base located on Okinawa, Japan. Finally, such a strike could
target US military facilities on US territory, most notably Andersen Air
Force Base (AFB) on Guam. Even if the United States or its allies had
not yet declared their intent to support Taiwan against a Chinese
invasion with military force, **[Chinese [leadership
could]{.mark}]{.underline}** still decide that such intervention was
likely and decide to **[[engage in nuclear use
early]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[motivated by the possibility of
significantly reducing the capacity]{.underline}** of the United States
or its allies **[to intervene in the conflict]{.underline}**. Nuclear
use before a declaration of war could possibly be more useful to China
if US or allied forces were not yet alerted or dispersed.

In addition to this warfighting logic, **[a Chinese
[decision]{.mark}]{.underline}** to use nuclear weapons against US
forces **[[could be motivated by]{.mark} a desire to avoid
defeat]{.underline}**: If Chinese leadership believed that it was losing
a conventional war over Taiwan, it might seek to escalate to nuclear use
in hopes of compelling negotiations for a settlement---**[a similar
logic to]{.underline}** the Russian
"**[[escalate-to-de-escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**" strategy.22

Additionally, it is possible (though, of these possibilities, least
likely), that Chinese leadership might believe, due to escalation in a
conventional war, that US nuclear use may be likely and imminent. In
that scenario, the CCP could decide that a preemptive, large-scale
nuclear strike on the US homeland is necessary. This seems especially
unlikely given the ultimate escalatory nature of this action and the
reality that China does not---and will very likely not for the next five
to ten years---possess a strategic force capable of a successful
counterforce strike on the US nuclear triad. The United States will
likely retain a robust second-strike capability in that time period.
Such an attack, therefore, would likely result in a destructive
retaliatory strike on the Chinese homeland---Chinese leadership is
unlikely to take that risk.

In sum, if Beijing decided to invade Taiwan, China could possibly engage
in nuclear threats or use to deter outside intervention; compel Taiwan
to surrender; defeat Taiwanese, US, or allied forces; or force
negotiations if the Chinese conventional offensive was on the brink of
collapse.

Scenarios for US Limited Nuclear First Use

The United States might choose to use nuclear weapons in the event of a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan---especially if a Chinese victory looked
imminent or if China engaged in a nonnuclear strategic attack on the US
homeland. US declaratory policy does not rule out nuclear first use.23
This policy assures allies and partners that the United States would
consider using nuclear weapons to deter or respond to a strategic
attack. Further, it forces a potential adversary not to count out US
nuclear weapons if it aggressed against a US ally or partner. The United
States has previously identified conditions for nuclear first use as a
response to aggression. During the Cold War, the United States relied on
nuclear deterrence to backstop local defenses, including prescribing
that nuclear weapons be "available for use as other conventional
munitions" in the event of hostilities.24 US strategists planned for
nuclear first use in the event of a Soviet invasion of West Germany, a
situation not dissimilar to the potential local conventional inferiority
the United States may soon be facing in the Taiwan Strait. It is not
outside the realm of possibility that US strategists today could adapt
plans like those for the specific political and physical geography of
the contemporary Western Pacific, alongside greater investment in
conventional defense and closer collaboration with allies.25

**[The [likeliest scenarios for US]{.mark} nuclear [first
use]{.mark}]{.underline}** during a Chinese invasion of Taiwan **[[would
be an attack]{.mark} directly [against the]{.mark} Chinese [invasion
force]{.mark} in the face of a Taiwanese defeat [or as]{.mark}
[retaliation for]{.mark}]{.underline}** a large-scale **[nonnuclear
strategic [attack on the]{.mark} US [homeland]{.mark} or]{.underline}**
that of its **[allies]{.underline}**.

The United States could find itself in a scenario in which the president
decides to use nuclear weapons because he or she seeks to prevent the
success of a Chinese invasion but lacks the conventional forces to do
so. This situation could come about for a variety of reasons, including
an intelligence failure that does not provide warning of a Chinese
buildup, a successful Chinese conventional preemptive strike on key US
conventional forces in the region, or a failure by the United States to
invest in sufficient conventional forces to defend Taiwan. In this case,
the United States would seek to use nuclear weapons against the invasion
force to frustrate the immediate success of the attack and to provide
time for reinforcements or give room for diplomacy.

The United States might also seek to use nuclear weapons to deter or
respond to a nonnuclear strategic attack on the US homeland or nuclear
command and control. The 2022 National Defense Strategy
"\[r\]ecogniz\[es\] growing kinetic and non-kinetic threats to the
United States' homeland from our strategic competitors."26 China can
likely conduct kinetic or non-kinetic attacks on the United States.
These attacks could include disruptions of critical infrastructure
(e.g., the power grid or financial system), which might rise to the
level of "extreme circumstances" that threaten "the vital interests" of
the United States, as described in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review.27 US
leaders might consider nuclear use to demonstrate to China that it
cannot expect to gain enduring advantage from these nonnuclear strategic
attacks on the US homeland or those of US allies and partners.

Scenarios for an Extended Nuclear Exchange

In the event that either the United States or China used a single
nuclear weapon or a handful of nuclear weapons in any of the scenarios
above, the prospect for an extended nuclear exchange would loom large.
Of course, a single nuclear detonation would not lead automatically to a
nuclear Armageddon. Chinese leadership could conceivably elect not to
respond to US nuclear use with nuclear weapons of its own---especially
if China seemed likely to prevail regardless. A US response to a Chinese
nuclear first use could also possibly convince Chinese leadership that
it had nothing to gain from further escalation. As in the Cold War,
strategists on both sides will identify pathways from one nuclear
battlefield use to a full nuclear exchange, so that knowledge may induce
caution for both parties.

**[If a single nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon **[is used]{.underline}**,
**[[it is not hard to imagine how that could escalate]{.mark} to a
strategic nuclear exchange]{.underline}**. The United States might use
nuclear weapons against Chinese landing ships. **[China could retaliate
by striking Andersen AFB on Guam]{.underline}**. **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[could strike several
airfields on the Chinese mainland]{.underline}**. China could retaliate
by using an ICBM against US military bases in Alaska.
**[[Strategists]{.underline}]{.mark}** on both sides **[would [start
to]{.mark} seriously [contemplate]{.mark} the value of a
[damage-limiting strike]{.mark}]{.underline}** as a broader exchange
begins to look inevitable. Indeed, **[[given]{.mark} that [the number
of]{.mark} US [nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}**lear weapon**[[s]{.mark}
available for theater-based]{.underline}**, **[low-yield strikes [is
quite lo]{.mark}w]{.underline}**, **[such [pressures]{.mark} might
[emerge]{.mark} relatively [early]{.mark} for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates.

#### Taiwan invasion sets off a [wave]{.underline} of [global]{.underline} catastrophes\-\--[extinction]{.underline}. 

**Easton 23**, MA, China Studies, National Changchi University, senior
director and research fellow, Project 2049 Institute \[Ian, "The World
After Taiwan\'s Fall," Pacific Forum International, Issues and Insights,
23.2)

American policymakers and military leaders are increasingly convinced
that the **[[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [is]{.mark} the strategic [nerve
center of the world]{.mark}. No other flashpoint is as structurally
unstable, as]{.underline}** politically vexing, and as **[likely to draw
the world's leading superpowers into a war]{.underline}**. Through both
word and deed, Chairman Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party
(**[[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) elite **[are signaling their intention
to [annihilate Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**'s government
**[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the use of overwhelming
**[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a growing concern in
Washington that it may no longer be a question of if a Chinese attack on
Taiwan will occur, but when and how.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

Of course, it is debatable whether the CCP high command is operating
according to a cast iron timeline. While prudent U.S. defense planners
might assume that the countdown to war has already begun (and argue that
countervailing American and Taiwanese preparations should proceed
accordingly), wise strategists will not close their minds to other
possibilities. It may very well be the case that Xi Jinping's plans and
intentions for Taiwan are elastic and changeable. For all we know, Xi is
convinced that a long-term campaign of coercion will succeed at
crumbling the Taiwanese government's ability to resist annexation. It
may even be the case that several politicians in Taiwan have been
secretly cultivated by Chinese intelligence, and they might one day
collaborate with the CCP to affect a takeover. The purpose of this
paper, however, is not to discuss such analytic problems, but rather to
explore what lies beyond the compass of the current discourse. An
understudied aspect of the Taiwan defense debate is what would happen
after an invasion was over. What might happen, for example, if the
People's Republic of China (PRC) succeeded in conquering Taiwan? How
would that impact U.S. national security? If Taiwan (Republic of China,
ROC) falls, what would the implications be for regional and global
security? In the following pages, we will examine these questions and
attempt to come to grips with an overlooked aspect of the most
consequential foreign policy problem of our time. Into the Great Unknown
It is axiomatic that there is no way for us to know how the future will
unfold. Unlike a code, puzzle, or cipher, the future cannot be solved.
There is no master key that can crack open the door and give us a look
at the scenes that will appear weeks, months, and years from now. At the
present time, we stand at the entryway of the here and now straining to
peer ahead, but we see nothing because there is nothing to see. That
world has yet to exist. Since accurate prediction is impossible and the
science of time travel remains speculative, we must exercise our
imaginations and, to a certain degree, our logic. We must think about
the unthinkable and accept that any thoughts we think will almost
certainly be falsified by events. Indeed, we will cherish the hope that
the future plays out in different ways entirely. With luck, the
following scenarios will prove wrong. Tens of millions of lives are at
stake, and the fates of billions of people could be irrevocably altered
by war in ways that we are ill- equipped to forecast. For the sake of
keeping our thought exercise within reasonable bounds, we will explore
only two of the manifold scenarios that are available or could be
conjured. In the first of our imagined futures, Taiwan is invaded by the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and falls with no outside assistance from
the United States or others. In the second imagined future, Taiwan is
stormed and occupied by the PLA in spite of belated U.S. and allied
attempts to forestall that eventuality. In scrutinizing both cases, our
main concern will not be the finer details of how the storyline
unspools, but rather what the situation looks like once it does and what
the implications are for the United States and the region. But before we
plunge into our two nightmare scenarios, let us first take stock of what
it would mean for the United States to lose Taiwan as a democratic
partner and strategic bulwark against PRC expansionism. The Constants If
Taiwan falls, several implications will remain constant irrespective of
how it happens. Taiwan has outsized strategic value due to its
extraordinary political character, its unique military and intelligence
capabilities, its critical role in global high-tech supply chains, and
its geographic location in the heart of East Asia. Regardless of how
Taiwan is captured by the Chinese authorities, the region and the world
will have lost a leading democracy, and the security architecture of the
region will be altered. This would be a traumatic---and potentially
catastrophic---event in the history of American foreign policy. When a
Democracy Dies At the time of this writing, Taiwan is ranked among the
top 10 democracies in the world.1 Freedom House gave Taiwan a composite
score of 94 out of 100 when it came to measures of global freedom (in
comparison the United States ranked 83 and China ranked 9).2 Reporters
Without Borders recently said that Taiwan has a remarkably high level of
press freedom. Taiwan ranked 38 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom
Index (in comparison the United States ranked 42 and China ranked 175).3
Since its transition to democracy, Taiwan has not had a seat at the
United Nations or other international organizations. The United States
and many other countries nonetheless have robust unofficial
relationships with Taiwan, and Taiwan is widely considered by
governments across the democratic world to be a responsible, like-minded
partner and a model of good governance. Today, Taiwan can be counted on
to advance democratic values and human rights. If Taiwan was conquered,
it would become an occupied territory ruled by China's one-party
dictatorship. Its politics would fundamentally change. The free and
independent country that used to be Taiwan (ROC) would disappear, and a
repressive police state would emerge. The Chinese military would
establish an overwhelming presence on Taiwan alongside the CCP's
multi-layered internal security forces (MSS, MPS, PAP, Chengguan, etc.).
The Communist Party can be expected to employ terror tactics against the
local Taiwanese population. The mass surveillance and control complex
that is omnipresent in Xinjiang and Tibet would likely be exported to
Taiwan. A local proxy government under the direct control of Beijing
would rule the islands, and all territory formerly administered by the
ROC government would be harshly policed. Patriotic education and mass
propaganda campaigns would be launched in Taiwan to spread "Xi Jinping
Thought" and imprint "Chinese socialist values" onto the minds of the
vanquished population. A number of Taiwan's film, television, and
Mandopop stars can be expected to amplify Beijing's messages (many
already do). The post-invasion media environment would be characterized
by its high levels of censorship. Taiwan would exist on the brink of an
informational blackhole. While international reporters would not have
open access to Taiwan, it seems almost certain that scattered pieces of
information would emerge out of occupied areas in the form of grisly
pictures, video recordings, and refugee testimony that show violations
of human rights were underway.

an [unchecked]{.mark} fashion]{.underline}**. The loss of Taiwan could

liberal democracies too weak to resist the new world order that Beijing
was creating.

Lost Military and Intelligence Capabilities

**[Taiwan's military stands watch over]{.underline}** the vulnerable
flanks of **[Japan]{.underline}**'s southwestern approaches, protecting
Japan **[and other East Asian countries from the threat of PRC
expansionism]{.underline}**. Indeed, the ROC armed forces patrol and
monitor some of the world's busiest lines of communication. The air,
water, and electromagnetic spectrum around Taiwan are dense with all
manner of military and commercial traffic. Although often
unacknowledged, Taiwan's military has long been a reliable partner to
the United States on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
operations. The U.S. and ROC governments reportedly share intelligence,
which the Americans are well positioned to collect with sophisticated
satellites, aircraft, and submarines, and the Taiwanese collect with
human agents, listening posts, and surveillance radars.4

**[If Taiwan falls, its military bases and intelligence]{.underline}**
facilities **[would be occupied by the [PLA]{.mark}. The Chinese navy
can be expected to base]{.underline}** its ships and submarines in
Taiwan's deep-water ports. The naval bases at Su'ao and Keelung would be
especially valuable for the PLA, **[which for the first
time]{.underline}** in its history would **[[have unencumbered access
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the deep waters of the **[[Pacific]{.mark}.
The American, Japanese, and Taiwanese]{.underline}** surveillance
**[systems]{.underline}** that currently track Chinese submarines in the
shallow waters off the East Asian littorals **[would be]{.underline}**
rendered less effective (or **[completely neutralized]{.underline}** in
Taiwan's case).

By invading and occupying Taiwan, the **[PLA would breach the center of
the First Island Chain]{.underline}**. After the invasion, Chinese
bombers and missile units based on Taiwan would be able to
**[[hold]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. forces in **[[Okinawa]{.mark} and
[Guam at risk of]{.mark} surprise [raids]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Chinese
special forces and amphibious units **[could use Taiwan to
[invade]{.mark} Japan's [Ryukyu]{.mark}]{.underline}** islands
(**[Yonaguni, Ishigaki]{.underline}**, etc.) **[and Luzon, the
[Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline}**' largest and most populated island.
PLA Navy surface action groups and aviation units based in Taiwan and
the Penghu islands could **[threaten a blockade of Japan and South
[Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}** by cutting off their primary sea lines of
communication. The **[top of the [S]{.mark}]{.underline}**outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea **[would
be "corked"]{.underline}**---providing PLA ballistic missile submarines
with a maritime bastion and further **[reinforcing China's military
dominance]{.underline}** of Southeast Asia.

The United States would lose access to a critical intelligence gathering
hub, and the American analytic community would lose their primary window
into China. Taiwan is an irreplaceable source of Mandarin language
training and all-source intelligence on China. Without Taiwan, the
Pentagon and CIA would likely begin producing flawed analytical
products, which could leave policymakers ill-informed and prone to
making strategic mistakes. In the wake of the successful Chinese
invasion of Taiwan, U.S. intelligence failures could be expected to
increase.

Shattered Supply Chains

Today, Taiwan is the United States' 8th largest trading partner.5
According to the State Department: "U.S. exports of goods and services
to Taiwan supported an estimated 188,000 American jobs in 2019 \...
Taiwanese cumulative investment in the United States was nearly \$137
billion in 2020. Taiwan's direct investment \... directly support an
estimated 21,000 jobs in the United States and \$1.5 billion in U.S.
exports."6 A cross-Strait war would cost hundreds of thousands of
Americans their jobs, and hundreds of billions of dollars would be lost.

Further deeper economic pain would likely follow the initial blow to
American prosperity. "U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Taiwan
(stock) was \$31.5 billion in 2020, a 8.8 percent increase from 2019.
Reported U.S. direct investment in Taiwan is led by manufacturing,
finance and insurance, and wholesale trade," according to the Office of
the United States TradeRepresentative.7

**[The loss of Taiwan would]{.underline}** negatively impact the health
of the U.S. economy and could **[[trigger]{.mark} an economic
[recession]{.mark}]{.underline}** in America and **[[across]{.mark} the
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A recent report asserted that
"**[[Taiwan]{.mark} may be the most [critical link in]{.mark} the entire
[tech]{.mark}nology [ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline}**," **[due to its
dominance in]{.underline}** the **[chip sector]{.underline}**, original
equipment manufacturing, original design manufacturing, and role as a
central hub for producing technology-related materials. The report
found, "Taiwan currently serves as a **[key supplier]{.underline}** and
partner **[to]{.underline}** many leading **[U.S. technology firms like
Apple, Nvidia, Texas Instruments, and Qualcomn, as well as to many U.S.
allies globally]{.underline}**."8 **[That would all
disappear]{.underline}**, forcing companies to suffer massive profit
losses at the very moment they needed to invest in costly new
facilities.

It is possible that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cause a 21st
century version of the Great Depression. In any event, globalization
would probably cease to exist, as the world splintered into hostile
trade and security blocs. **[[Supply chains]{.mark},
already]{.underline}** significantly **[impacted by]{.underline}** the
COVID-19 **[pandemic]{.underline}**, the Russian invasion of **[Ukraine,
and]{.underline}** instability in the **[Middle East, would be
[shattered. Prices]{.mark} would [skyrocket]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Panic buying and hording would be followed by a **[[surge in nativism
and]{.mark} strong impulse toward]{.underline}** trade
**[[protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and self-sufficiency.

Harsh Geostrategic Realities

By seizing Taiwan, the **[[PRC]{.mark} would have]{.underline}**
effectively **[carved out a [s]{.mark}]{.underline}**phere
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence for
itself in Asia using violent methods. This invasion would **[have grave
implications for international law]{.underline}**, the ideal of national
self-determination, and the principle of state sovereignty. The fall of
Taiwan **[would undermine perceptions of U.S.]{.underline}** global
diplomatic and **[military leadership]{.underline}**, straining (and
possibly **[[brea]{.mark}king]{.underline}**) **[the American
alliance]{.underline}** system **[and]{.underline}** the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations
System. **[China would be]{.underline}** viewed as **[the most powerful
nation in the world]{.underline}** and the primary mover of the 21st
century. Leaders would experience trepidation as Beijing marched
**[toward]{.underline}** its vision of a **[new]{.underline}**
centralized, **[authoritarian world order]{.underline}**.

**[[Nuclear arms racing]{.underline}]{.mark}** would start and **[could
[easily]{.mark} rapidly [spiral]{.mark} out of control]{.underline}**.
The likelihood of **[[World War Three]{.underline}]{.mark}** breaking
out could **[[climb]{.mark} higher]{.underline}** than anything
previously seen. It can be expected that the **[world would begin
sliding toward]{.underline}** the brink of an **[abyss]{.underline}**,
and human **[[civilization]{.mark} would risk being [knocked
backward]{.mark}]{.underline}** in its developmental story. Abstract
ideas like international law and universal values would increasingly
appear quaint, even faintly ridiculous. This would be a new age of
empires; might would once more make right.

In such circumstances, **[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** could be
expected to go nuclear and **[[become]{.mark} heavily
[militarized]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Tokyo would likely be in the grip
of a profound sense of insecurity and disillusionment with U.S. defense
guarantees. It is possible that **[Japanese politics could [swing
in]{.mark} a right-wing, [authoritarian direction]{.mark}.
Alternatively]{.underline}**, it is possible that far left-wing
politicians could gain power, and Japan might **[end up band wagoning
with China]{.underline}**. In either event, there would be an increasing
risk that Japan's democracy would erode, and the country could
experience a wave of political violence. Over time, it may even be
**[possible]{.underline}** that **[Japan would become a
dictatorship]{.underline}**.

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in Seoul would face the unpalatable choice of
losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP influence
alongside the United States and Japan. **[South [Korea]{.mark} would
likely [go nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}** and attempt to save their
nation from takeover by **[building an independent deterrent
force]{.underline}**. South Korea may experience an even deeper domestic
political crisis than Japan. It seems likely that the **[Philippines,
Indonesia, Malaysia]{.underline}**, and other Southeast Asia nations
that are currently hedging their bets would conclude that they had no
choice but to **[align]{.underline}** themselves **[with
Beijing]{.underline}** against the United States.

**[[North]{.mark} Korea would likely be
[emboldened]{.mark}]{.underline}** by a successful Chinese invasion of
Taiwan and reconsider long-dormant **[plan]{.underline}**s
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** weaken and, if possible, **[destroy South
Korea's government and affect a [takeover]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the
peninsula. With the power and prestige of the United States drastically
reduced and South Korea acutely vulnerable, it seems probable that North
Korea would seek to obtain China's help in attacking South Korea.
**[Beijing]{.underline}** is likely to **[see the situation as an
opportunity to drive American forces off the Asian mainland. China's
government would]{.underline}** probably **[encourage]{.underline}** and
support some degree of **[North Korean aggression]{.underline}**. At a
minimum, an unprecedented campaign of coercion would likely result,
which could escalate to war. At the same time, CCP influence over
Pyongyang would grow, and North Korea would struggle in vain to maintain
its independence from the new PRC empire.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** would almost certainly see the loss of
Taiwan as a national security disaster and **[quickly [expand]{.mark}
its [nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}**lear weapons **[arsenal and further
[build up]{.mark} its conventional [military]{.mark} along the
border]{.underline}**. With Taiwan gone, the **[[PLA]{.mark} would
likely [focus on re-taking]{.mark} territories controlled by
[Delhi]{.mark}]{.underline}** as its next major mission. **[[Australia
will fear]{.mark} being [encircled]{.mark}]{.underline}** and isolated
as the Chinese military pushes across the South Pacific. **[Canberra
might opt to [develop]{.mark}]{.underline}** its own independent
**[[nuclear armaments]{.underline}]{.mark}** program and accelerate
plans to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad would be at a
distinctive crossroads; it may become the foundation for a collective
security organization like NATO, but it could just as easily fall apart.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. With the United States
distracted humiliated by China, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countries might rally together in common cause and redouble their
efforts to bolster collective security. It seems at least as probable,
however, that the post-war bonds that have long tied together the great
democracies of Europe **[[would fray]{.mark}. Combined Chinese and
Russian influence]{.underline}** campaigns might **[succeed in getting
[countries]{.mark} such as Germany, France, and Italy to [embrace

### \-\--xt: AT Stays Conventional\-\--2NC

#### Any US-China war goes nuclear quickly

**Chang 18**, CNN contributor (Gordon, \"China and Russia Have Set a
Nuclear Collision Course With the United States,\" Daily Beast,
https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-and-russia-have-set-a-nuclear-collision-course-with-the-united-states?ref=scroll)

Moreover, **[[any conflict between China and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[in
the Pacific could quickly escalate to nuclear
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

China, surpassing the U.S. last year, now boasts the world's largest
navy, and it is adding to its fleet "at a stunning rate," according to
the Times. Even last year, the count was lopsided with China claiming
317 surface vessels and subs in active service and the U.S. 283.

Of course, it's not clear how capable the People's Liberation Army Navy
is. The PLAN, as it is known, has never participated in a large-scale
wartime engagement at sea, and its fleet is not, on the whole, as modern
as America's.

Nonetheless, China has a few critical advantages. Its naval assets are
concentrated along its shores and U.S. forces are spread around the
globe; areas of likely conflict are near China and far from America; and
the PLAN has some crucial weapons that are better than those of the
United States, especially anti-ship missiles. Beijing has also gone big
into "asymmetric" warfare, for instance militarizing fishing fleets,
enlisting the "little blue men" of what has become a maritime militia.

The Chinese also have one other advantage: the will to use force to take
what is in the possession of others. In their peripheral seas, they
grabbed control of the Paracel Islands, in the northern portion of the
South China Sea, from South Vietnam in 1974 after a short battle. The
Chinese also seized Mischief Reef from the Philippines in a series of
actions from late 1994 to early 1995, and they snatched Scarborough
Shoal, also from Manila, in early 2012. Now, China is, among other
things, pressuring other Philippine features in the South China Sea and
using menacing tactics to take over a chain of uninhabited islets
currently under Japanese control in the East China Sea.

Moreover, **[[Beijing]{.mark} has]{.underline}** clearly **[[relished
challenging the U.S.]{.mark} Navy and Air Force in the global
commons]{.underline}**, threatening and on occasion **[[harassing
American ships, planes, and drones]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The seizure
of an American drone in international waters in December 2016, in sight
of the USNS Bowditch and in defiance of radio commands, was brazen and
nothing short of an act of war.

Moreover, Beijing's harassment of the USNS Impeccable in March 2009 in
the South China Sea, using its maritime militia, was so severe that it
constituted an attack on the United States.

"The key point is that **[[China accepts the risk of
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a greater extent than does the
U.S., **[[because China uses]{.mark} [confrontation to alter the status
quo in its favor]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Anders Corr, editor of Great
Powers, Grand Strategies: The New Game in the South China Sea, told the
National Interest at the beginning of this year.

**[China is]{.underline}** apparently **[willing to escalate all the
way.]{.underline}** But the New York Times, in its reporting last month,
did not mention one Chinese threat to American forces in the region:
nuclear attack.

"**[[For regional war]{.underline}]{.mark}**fare, **[[especially in
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[the]{.underline}**
**[P]{.underline}**]{.mark}eople's **[[L]{.underline}]{.mark}**iberation
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rmy **[[is equipped for nuclear
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}** both offensive and defensive," Richard
Fisher of the International Assessment and Strategy Center told The
Daily Beast. "If China can conjure a 'defensive' political moral high
ground to justify offensive military campaigns to retrieve 'lost'
territory, **[[we should be prepared for China's very early use of
nuclear weapons]{.mark} to support its theater campaign]{.underline}**.
**[We can]{.underline}**, for example, **[expect]{.underline}** China to
'demonstrate' nuclear weapons at sea to deter American or Japanese
military support for Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, or even
**[outright Chinese use of nuclear weapons against Japanese bases
supporting U.S. forces coming to the defense of Taiwan]{.underline}**."

## Impact---Warming

### I/L---China Key to Warming---2NC

#### China is key to solve warming internationally

**Brown 21**, citing prof David Tyfield of the Lancaster Environment
Centre, political columnist @ BBC (David, "Why China\'s climate policy
matters to us all," *BBC*,
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57483492)

Experts agree that **[[without big reductions in China\'s emissions, the
world cannot win the fight against climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In 2020, China\'s President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for
its emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon
neutrality before 2060.

His statement has now been confirmed as China\'s official position ahead
of the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow.

But China has not said exactly how these goals will be achieved.

Explosive growth

While all countries face problems getting their emissions down, **[China
is facing the biggest challenge]{.underline}**.

Per person, China\'s emissions are about half those of the US, but its
huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it
way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions.

China became the world\'s largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and
is now responsible for more than a quarter of the world\'s overall
greenhouse gas emissions.

It is expected to come under intense scrutiny at the COP26 summit over
its commitments to reduce these.

Along with all the other signatories to the Paris Agreement in 2015,
China agreed to make changes to try to keep global warming at 1.5C above
pre-industrial levels, and \"well below\" 2C.

China strengthened its commitments in 2020, but Climate Action Tracker,
an international group of scientists and policy experts say its current
actions to meet that goal are \"highly insufficient\".

Shift from coal

**[[Getting China\'s emissions down is
achievable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to many experts, **[[but
will require a radical shift]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Coal has been the country\'s main source of energy for decades.

Chart showing China\'s dependence on coal

Presentational white space

President Xi says China will \"phase down\" coal use from 2026 - and
will not build new coal-fired projects abroad - but some governments and
campaigners say the plans are not going far enough.

Researchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing say China will need to
stop using coal entirely for generating electricity by 2050, to be
replaced by nuclear and renewable energy production.

And far from shutting down coal-fired power stations, China is currently
building new ones at more than 60 locations across the country, with
many sites having more than one plant.

Map showing new coal-fired power stations being built across China

New stations are usually active for 30 to 40 years, so China will need
to reduce the capacity of newer plants as well as close old ones if it
is to bring emissions down, says researcher Philippe Ciais of the
Institute of Environment and Climate Science in Paris.

It may be possible to retrofit some to capture emissions, but the
technology to do so at scale is still developing, and many plants will
have to be written off after minimal use.

China argues it has a right to do what Western countries have done in
the past, releasing carbon dioxide in the process of developing its
economy and reducing poverty.

In the short term, Beijing has ordered coal mines to increase production
to avoid power shortages over the coming winter. Surging demand from
heavy industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to shortages
in several regions of the country in recent weeks.

But China is switching to green energy

Tsinghua University researchers say 90% of power should come from
nuclear and renewables by 2050.

In moving towards that goal, China\'s lead in the manufacture of green
technology, such as solar panels and large-scale batteries, may be a big
help.

China first embraced green technologies as a means to tackle air
pollution, a serious problem for many cities.

But the government also believes they have enormous economic potential,
providing jobs and income for millions of Chinese, as well as reducing
China\'s dependence on foreign oil and gas.

\"**[[China is already leading]{.mark} the global energy
transition]{.underline}**,\" says Yue Cao of the Overseas Development
Institute. \"One of the reasons we are able to deploy cheaper and
cheaper green technology is China.\"

Chart showing China\'s global lead in solar technology

Presentational white space

**[China generates more solar power than any other
country]{.underline}**. That might not be so impressive given China\'s
enormous population, but it is a sign of where the country is heading.

China\'s wind power installations were more than triple those of any
other country in 2020.

China says the proportion of its energy generated from non-fossil fuel
sources should be 25% by 2030, and it is expected by many observers to
hit the target early.

Electric drive

China ranks seventh in the world for its percentage of car sales that
are electric, but given its huge size, **[China makes and buys more
electric cars than any other country]{.underline}** by a considerable
margin.

Currently, about one in 20 cars bought in China is electric-powered.

By 2035, Chinese officials and car industry representatives are
predicting that almost all new vehicles sold in China will be fully
electric-powered or hybrid.

Chart showing electric cars by market share

Working out by how much the shift to electric vehicles reduces emissions
is not straightforward - particularly when taking into account
manufacturing and charging sources.

But studies suggest that emissions over the lifetimes of electric
vehicles are typically below those of petrol and diesel equivalents.

This matters because transport is responsible for around a quarter of
carbon emissions from fuel combustion, with road vehicles being the
largest emitters.

China will also by 2025 be producing batteries with double the capacity
of those produced by the rest of the world combined.

Observers say that will enable the storage and release of energy from
renewable sources on a previously impossible scale.

**[[China\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** land is **[[getting
greener]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions doesn\'t mean that China
will stop producing emissions.

It means China will cut emissions as much as possible and absorb what\'s
left, through a combination of different approaches.

Increasing the area of land covered in vegetation will help, as plants
absorb carbon dioxide.

Here again, there is encouraging news. **[China is getting greener at a
faster rate than any other country]{.underline}**, largely as a result
of its forestry programmes designed to reduce soil erosion and
pollution.

Map showing China greening at a rapid rate.

It is also partly a result of replanting fields to produce more than one
harvest per year, which keeps land covered in vegetation for longer.

What next?

**[[The world needs China to succeed]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

\"**[[Unless China decarbonises, we\'re not going to beat climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" says prof David Tyfield of the
Lancaster Environment Centre.

[programs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping
**[has reaffirmed China's commitment to combating]{.underline}** global
**[climate change]{.underline}** on several international forums.
According to him, China "will stay firmly on the path of green
development and continue to be an important force for global green
transition." He made this declaration at the APEC CEO Summit in November
2024.

At the World Leaders Climate Action Summit 2024, Chinese Vice Premier
Ding Xuexiang also declared that "China will work with all parties to
uphold the vision of building a community with a shared future for
mankind, make concerted efforts to protect Earth, our common home, and
jointly build a clean and beautiful world."

**[[China has transformed]{.underline}]{.mark}** over time

But now, for the first time, **[[there's been a
shift]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[[China's]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[emissions have]{.mark}]{.underline}** actually
**[[fallen]{.underline}]{.mark}** even **[[as energy demand went
up]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

According to a new report at Carbon Brief by Lauri Myllyvirta, an
analyst at Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, **[[China's
overall]{.underline}]{.mark}** greenhouse gas **[[emissions have
dropped]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the first time,
**[[thanks]{.underline}]{.mark}** largely [**[to the
country's]{.underline}** **[aggressive build-out of clean
energy]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Looking at official statistics and
commercial data, the analysis shows greenhouse gas output fell 1 percent
over the past year, even as China's overall energy use and economic
activity increased.

**[[It's]{.underline}]{.mark}** not a massive shift, but **[the fact
that the curve has bent]{.underline}** at all **[is
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[major development]{.underline}** **[for
the global effort against climate change.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

The growth rate of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions has begun to
level off, but it has yet to decline. In order to eventually halt
human-caused warming, that rate has to effectively reach zero, and in
order to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, that has to
happen roughly within the next three decades.

**[[The decline of emissions in China is a big step toward this
international goal, and the timing puts it on course for its own climate
targets]{.underline}]{.mark}**, too. China had previously committed to
peaking its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030.

"**[[This is]{.underline}]{.mark}** a little **[[ahead of
schedule]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Greenstone said. "**[The planet is
happy]{.underline}** about that."

Why did this happen?

In large part, **[the decline in emissions came from clean electricity
production]{.underline}**. **[China deployed]{.underline}** vastly more
**[wind, solar, and nuclear]{.underline}** power --- sources that don't
emit carbon dioxide --- **[at a pace faster than its electricity demand
growth]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, its coal and gas electricity
production dropped. China's emissions have dipped before due to economic
slowdowns, so the fact that its economy grew while emissions declined is
a significant turning point, putting China in a league with more than 30
countries, including the US, that have already done the same.

China has established itself as the world's largest producer of solar
panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and batteries, driving down
prices for the global market. **[[It's deploying]{.mark} these
[tech]{.mark}nologies [within its own borders]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[as well as exporting them en masse]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and some
of its biggest customers are developing countries. That means
**[[China's investments in clean energy redound to the rest of the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Renewables accounted for 90 percent of new
power capacity installed worldwide last year.

#### Chinese leadership is sufficient to solve warming in China [and]{.underline} globally.

**Guo 21**, Senior Research Fellow, Environment and Society Centre

China and the world

**[[China is key to]{.mark} ensuring [a stable
climate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is one of the countries most
sensitive to the impacts of climate change, with a higher warming rate
than the global average, but **[[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
**[[the world's largest emitter]{.underline}]{.mark}** of greenhouse gas
emissions.

Indeed, the Chinese government has recognized climate change as a key
non-traditional security threat to the country's sustainable development
and, on 22 September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that
the country aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, receiving applause
from the international community.

Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has announced that the country aims to
reach carbon neutrality by 2060.

The recently adopted 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2020-25), though falling
short of international calls to introduce a cap on total carbon
emissions over the next five years and a lower than expected carbon
intensity target of 18 per cent, has put forward an action plan for
peaking CO2 emissions by 2030 while confirming the country's net-zero
2060 target -- with more robust policies expected to be on the way.

The plan also explicitly mentions the control of non-CO2 greenhouse
gases for the first time, such as methane, indicating that China is
looking to take all greenhouse gases into account.

Xi Jinping signaled China's commitment in his speech at the Leaders
Summit on Climate hosted by US President Joe Biden on Earth Day.

If China is able to accelerate its decarbonization over the first five
years towards its 2060 target, it will not only provide a clearer
indication of when China's CO2 emissions will peak by 2030, but it will
also show whether the peak could reach a lower value, which is critical
for China to achieve its net-zero target.

Importantly, Xi Jinping signaled China's commitment again this week in
his speech at the Leaders Summit on Climate, hosted by US President Joe
Biden on Earth Day, stating Chinese coal consumption and coal-fired
power projects will be strictly controlled over the next five years and
phased down as part of the country's 15th Five-Year Plan post-2025.

The decisive green transition

Following the disruption that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, not only
to economic development but also to energy consumption and carbon
emissions, China and the rest of the world, cannot afford to continue
with a business-as-usual approach: it's too risky and too expensive.
Instead, **[[a decisive green transition]{.underline}]{.mark}** is an
approach that is both practical and also mutually beneficial for
countries around the world.

2°C

If current growth rates for renewables continue over the next decade, it
**[[could bring the world in line with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
ambition of the Paris Agreement to keep global warming to well below
**[[2 °]{.underline}]{.mark}**C.

Based on a rigorous analysis of the historical trends of the costs of
energy technologies, Oxford University, as part of a project led by
Chatham House, has devised a new, simple and transparent model which
finds that a decisive green transition -- in which current growth rates
for renewables continue over the next decade -- can bring the world
almost entirely in line with the ambition of the Paris Agreement to keep
global warming to well below 2 °C.

Crucially, the decisive green transition does not require a reduction in
economic growth nor does it rely on large investments in unproven
controversial technologies -- and it is likely to be much less expensive
than continuing with the current fossil-fuels based system.

China's ability to meet its climate targets, particularly under the 14th
Five-Year Plan, will rest not only on its domestic efforts but also on
tighter international cooperation.

This new perspective suggests renewable energy, like solar and wind, can
provide a cost-effective steady and secure energy supply, offering China
and the world a different opportunity to rethink how to transition to a
Paris-compliant world.

But **[the international community needs to join forces]{.underline}**
**[to accelerate]{.underline}** the **[[deployment of
renewables]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[China could play a critical
role in]{.mark} doing [this]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** is the world's most populous nation,
has the second largest economy and is the largest emitter of greenhouse
gas emissions, and as such, [**[is fundamental]{.underline}** **[to the
success of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[any]{.underline}]{.mark}** global
**[[agreement]{.mark}s [to tackle climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

First, **[there is a significant possibility]{.underline}** that the
**[atmospheric [CO2]{.mark}]{.underline}** levels EPA predicts **[[will
result in]{.mark} much [more]{.mark} extreme [warming than
projected]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, if pre-Industrial
Revolution CO2 concentrations double to approximately 560 ppm,53
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) modeling estimates a
likely range of warming between 1.5°C and 4.5°C. 54 However, models also
include less likely but possible risks of severe warming. In the IPCC
models for 560 ppm, average temperatures could increase beyond the
4.5-degree mark, with the likelihood of a temperature increase greater
than 6°C between zero and ten percent. 55 Economists have estimated the
chance as three percent. 56

\[\[FN 53\]\]

53 **[[Because there is a time lag between g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse
[g]{.mark}as emission[s and]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark} system's
[response to]{.mark} those [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, scientists
have developed the concept of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, which
identifies the total warming that eventually results from a doubling of
atmospheric greenhouse gases. Id. at 278.

\[\[END FN 53\]\]

At the 789 ppm concentration projected in the SAFE Vehicles FEIS,57 the
probability of extreme warming is much greater. Given a 700 ppm
concentration, economists Martin Weitzman and Gernot Wagner estimate the
probability of warming greater than 6°C as about ten percent.58 The last
time the Earth warmed so much, so rapidly---during the end-Permian mass
extinction event 252 million years ago59---up to 95% of all species went
extinct.60 Therefore, under the agency's 789 ppm premise, there is a
"roughly 10 percent chance of near-certain disaster."61 A ten-percent
chance of an event is meaningful; if someone's home had a tenpercent
chance of suffering catastrophic loss, it would likely be uninsurable in
the private market. Yet EPA completely failed to consider this
intolerable risk of catastrophe in adopting the Rule.

As mentioned above, **[there is]{.underline}** a second kind of
**[uncertainty in climate models: for a given amount of warming, there
might be greater impacts]{.underline}**. Specifically, **[there is a
significant risk of irreversible events]{.underline}** that would have
major negative consequences for natural and human systems. These events
are commonly characterized as "tipping points."62
"**[[Exceeding]{.underline}]{.mark}** one or more **[[tipping
points]{.mark}" [could lead to]{.mark} climate
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}** that occurs "**[[so quickly]{.mark} and
unexpectedly]{.underline}** that **[[human]{.mark} system[s]{.mark}
would [have difficulty adapting]{.mark}]{.underline}** to \[it\]."63
**[Tipping [points]{.mark} are not separate]{.underline}** and discrete;
rather, **[one [can feed into another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Recent
studies suggest both that "**[[cascading]{.mark} effects]{.underline}**"
leading to a "less habitable 'hothouse' climate . . . might be
common,"64 and that they **[pose "[an existential threat]{.mark} to
civilization]{.underline}**."65

As the effects of climate change have manifested more rapidly in recent
years than previously anticipated, 66 **[a tipping point cascade
seems]{.underline}** increasingly **[possible]{.underline}**. Consider
**[the]{.underline}** West **[[Antarctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** Ice
Sheet, which **[has been [showing]{.mark} signs of [structural
weakness]{.mark}]{.underline}** as warming ocean waters push at its
base.67 Measurements of melting processes show them outpacing
theoretical predictions by two orders of magnitude.68 Should the ocean
erode the sheet's support, **[[it could disintegrate,
triggering]{.underline}]{.mark}** meters of **[[sea]{.mark} level
[rise]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the coming centuries.69
**[Other]{.underline}** possible **[tipping points
include]{.underline}** massive ice loss in **[Greenland and the
Arctic]{.underline}**70 and the **[[release of methane
from]{.underline}]{.mark}** warming **[[permafrost]{.mark} and
tundra]{.underline}**.71

The federal government has affirmed the **[scientific consensus that
"[the further]{.mark} and faster [Earth's]{.mark} climate system is
[changed]{.mark}, the [greater]{.mark} the [risk of unanticipated
changes]{.mark}]{.underline}**"72 that could lead to extreme climate
impacts. Indeed, EPA itself has acknowledged the possibility of "low
probability, high impact" events.73

According to the IPCC, the difference between 1.5°C and 3°C of warming
could significantly increase the likelihood of passing a tipping point.
74 With warming of 1.5°C or less, it is "likely" that Arctic summer sea
ice could continue to exist; however, 3°C of warming would "very likely"
result in ice free summers in the Arctic.75 Similarly, warming of 1.5°C
or less carries a risk of "17-44% reduction in permafrost," but 3°C of
warming may lead to "\[p\]otential . . . permafrost collapse."76 Because
the federal government projects 3.48 degrees of warming by the end of
the century, 77 these IPCC projections for 3 degrees of warming are
conservative. As temperatures rise, the probability of exceeding tipping
points increases, along with the probability of disasters that could
irreversibly damage the United States. 78

For a decade, EPA has recognized the role of mitigating extreme risk in
guiding rational approaches to climate regulation. But rather than
consider catastrophic warming scenarios, the Rule does not discuss
climate sensitivity or extreme impacts, let alone account for them in
the regulation. A rational regulator would at least consider buying
"'climate insurance' taken out against the most severe and irreversible
potential consequences of climate change," as the Council of Economic
Advisers has described it.79

C. EPA Arbitrarily Ignores the Urgency of Reducing Emissions

**[[Every year]{.mark} that passes [without]{.mark} adequate [emissions

provided a reason for its decision to delay a meaningful response to
this urgent problem.

**[Delay]{.underline}** creates two distinct risks. First, as the SAFE
Vehicles FEIS acknowledges, it "**[results in a greater accumulation of
CO2]{.underline}** in the atmosphere, thereby **[increasing the risk of
crossing tipping points]{.underline}** and triggering abrupt changes."80
Second, **[delay reduces the time remaining to achieve a particular
target, making future action more]{.underline}** costly than action in
the present.81 "\[A\]ny short run gains from delay tend to be outweighed
by the additional costs arising from the need to adopt a more abrupt and
stringent policy later."82 A White House Council of Economic Advisers
analysis estimated that the costs of addressing climate change increase
41% for each decade of delay. 83 Those cost increases are associated
only with the timing of action, not the total amount of emissions
reduced. They are the costs of making up for lost time.

The next two decades are critical. The IPCC has forecast that "\[i\]n
model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net
anthropogenic \[CO2\] emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by
2030 . . . reaching net zero around 2050."84 All of the IPCC's pathways
to avoid the worst impacts require substantial annual reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2030.85 The timeframe for
stabilizing the climate shrinks as atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations rise and the odds of passing a tipping point increase.
Because "the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at
best,"86 the United States may be running out of time to change course.

EPA knows that action is imperative. In 2009, relying on assessments
that "synthesize literally thousands of individual studies,"87 EPA
concluded that there was "good reason to act now."88 As EPA wrote then
in the Endangerment Finding, "\[t\]here continues to be no reason to
expect that, without substantial and near-term efforts to significantly
reduce emissions, atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases will not
continue to climb, and thus lead to ever greater rates of climate
change."89 Ten years later, these arguments have only strengthened in
force.90 According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, "early and
substantial mitigation offers a greater chance of avoiding increasingly
adverse impacts."91

In spite of the weight of **[[scientific evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that **[[supports]{.mark} an [immediate response]{.mark} to
warming]{.underline}**, the Rule chooses to defer action on power sector
emissions without explanation. **[To help limit the worst impacts of
climate destabilization, CO2 emissions]{.underline}** from the U.S.
power sector **[must decline]{.underline}** by an average of roughly
thirty to fifty million metric tons per year to reach net zero emissions
by 2050 or 2070.92 By EPA's own projections, the Rule will reduce CO2
emissions by an average of only four million metric tons per year until
2050, a number virtually indistinguishable from the "reference case"
projection of no federal limits at all. 93 These minute reductions would
have essentially no impact on United States greenhouse gas emissions.

EPA's projections for emissions reductions under the Rule fall far short
of any rational policy to stabilize the climate. A comparison of the
Rule reductions to what the IPCC concludes is necessary to limit warming
to 1.5°C or 2°C, see Figure 2, shows that the Rule leads to emissions
levels almost identical to the status quo.

This abdication comes at a critical juncture. **[[Minor changes
at]{.mark} the [level of]{.mark} the
[source]{.mark}]{.underline}**---selecting heat rate improvements rather
than **[a broader best system of emission reduction---[lead to major
risks]{.mark} for the nation]{.underline}**. EPA never explains, and
cannot explain, why the Rule meanders around the emissions reduction
problem when scientists warn that a direct path to immediate reductions
is needed to escape disaster.

#### AND it [magnifies]{.underline} all other [existential risks]{.underline}.

**[[Large]{.mark} amounts of [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
monumental Earth-engineering **[[may not be needed to trigger
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Historically, minor climatic
perturbations and droughts appear to have contributed to the dissolution
of dozens of empires and kingdoms, ranging from the Bronze Age world
system to the Khmer Empire, Western Roman Empire, and Assyrian Empire.45
Yet many proved resilient to similar stresses. For instance, the Mayan
city-state of Caracol experienced two similar droughts during its
lifespan, one of which it navigated with few signs of breakdown, and the
other which coincided with a rapid and enduring crisis. The largest
difference appears not to be the severity of the drought, but that
Caracol was riven by warfare and inequality when it hit the second
time.46

**[[Risk cascades still]{.mark} largely [exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**
under a fog of uncertainty. Studies currently suggest that **[climate
change can worsen and trigger conflicts]{.underline}** under conditions
such as weak governance and ethnic divisions,47 although we do not know
how this relationship could morph under higher temperatures. Similarly,
temperature does seem to have an innate and often non-linear
relationship with economic growth48 and even population spread and
density. It has been suggested that humans, much like other species,
have a fundamental climatic niche---that is, a specific climate envelope
of approximately 13°C (mean annual average temperature) that the
majority of human population and urban areas have developed within over
millennia.49 Perhaps the best study to date on risk cascades and
feedbacks used 41 studies to empirically sketch the links between
climate change, food insecurity, and societal collapse (population loss
through conflict, mortality, and emigration).50 Other researchers in
global catastrophic risk have also begun putting forward frameworks for
more complex risk assessments,51 including for climate change52 and
international governance.53 For now, far greater attention and research
is needed on these systemic effects, such as climate triggering
conflict, political change, or even financial crises.

Indeed, understanding 'societal fragility' is a key part of the Climate
Endgame research agenda, alongside exploring long-term extreme Earth
System states, modelling mass mortality and morbidity, and undertaking
integrated climate catastrophe assessments, which include climate change
alongside a host of other catastrophic threats and vulnerabilities.30

An existential end? Could global environmental collapse cause human
extinction?

This leads us to the central question: could combined ecological crises
cause this to be humanity's final century? Few have been bold enough to
directly broach the question. There have been many prophesied warnings,
especially within the collapse literature, but no truly comprehensive
scientific assessments. Questions of catastrophe are not directly
addressed by any relevant, international scientific institutions, such
as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or
Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

Many individual papers have mentioned the catastrophic potential of
climate change. Peer-reviewed academic studies have referred to global
warming as an "existential threat",5 "beyond catastrophic" (for above
5°C),54 and "an indisputable global catastrophe" (for above 6°C).55
While the impacts of climate change alone seem capable of causing a
global catastrophic risk, the authors never spell out how the world
would fall from such impacts to mass mortality. Importantly, the gloomy
terms are never defined, leaving it unknown as to whether the authors
believe that certain levels of warming could plausibly lead to human
extinction. These are no studies nor proofs of existential risks from
climate change, but rather indications of a lack of shared terminology.

In lieu of sustained scientific attention, the most poignant
examinations have come from popular books. Mark Lynas in Our Final
Warning concludes, based on a large-scale review of the existing
scientific literature, that 4°C could threaten a global collapse, and
5--6+°C could unravel into human extinction.56 David Wallace-Wells in
The Uninhabitable Earth guesses that, in contrast to the title, the
Earth will not become uninhabitable, and humans will survive foreseeable
levels of warming.57 Toby Ord in The Precipice suggests a 1 in 1000
chance of climate change resulting in an existential catastrophe.58
William MacAskill in What We Owe the Future suggests that "it's hard to
see how even this could lead directly to civilizational collapse".59

**[The [assessments by]{.mark} existential risk scholars---[Ord]{.mark}
and MacAskill--- [have been]{.mark} the [least convincing]{.mark} thus
far. Ord uses an unworkable]{.underline}**, ambiguous **[definition of
existential risk]{.underline}**.60 He defines an existential risk as one
that "threatens the destruction of humanity's long-term potential".
However, what our potential is depends on one's values. Ord suggests
that we minimise existential risks first and then determine "our
potential" through a "Long Reflection". This would essentially be a
centuries-long worldwide philosophical conversation. This strategy
creates a paradox: we are supposed to minimise risks to a concept that
we cannot define until after we have reduced those risks. It is
difficult---if not impossible--- to assess climate change using this
definition, as Ord doesn't explicitly state his values, nor what "our
potential" is. **[His [analysis misses]{.mark} much of the most [recent
science and]{.mark} does not sufficiently consider 'indirect'
impacts]{.underline}**. Moreover, the chapter does not cogently answer
the question of whether climate change will result in human extinction.
Instead, after roughly estimating the direct impacts, Ord concludes that
they will not make the entirety of Earth uninhabitable. This is an
entirely different question to the likelihood of climate change causing
human extinction. **[Ord's use of a precise [numerical figure is]{.mark}
also largely [baseless]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As noted earlier, even
groups of the best super-forecasters making predictions on clearly
defined questions have little accuracy after 12 months.61

MacAskill's analysis is also riddled with problems. Like Ord, he suffers
from definitional problems. He defines 'civilisational collapse' as
society losing the ability to create most industrial and post-industrial
technologies.62 This has little relation to more common definitions of
societal collapse. It also assumes that we know the full range of
potential industrial and post-industrial technologies. Worse still, like
with Ord's analysis, it replaces the question of whether climate change
will cause civilisational collapse with an easier one: will climate
change make large-scale agriculture on Earth impossible? MacAskill
concludes no. Once again, this is a different question. In short, the
coverage of climate change by the most prominent existential risk
scholars has been simplistic and disappointing.

While brave, the conclusions of Wallace-Wells and Lynas are ultimately
individual guesses with multiple shortcomings. Wallace-Wells is unclear
about how he reaches his conclusion. **[[Lynas relies on]{.mark}
geological [studies and the analogous]{.mark} example of the
End-[Permian]{.mark} Extinction. [His]{.mark}]{.underline}** more
pessimistic **[[assessment]{.mark} appears [the most compelling]{.mark}.
It [has the most thorough grounding]{.mark} in the literature [and,
in]{.mark} the [face of]{.mark} deep [uncertainty, relies on]{.mark} the
[most reliable]{.mark} and relevant geological
[precedents]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

This is astute, given that studies suggest that mass extinction events
work by a threshold effect for temperature or carbon that we look likely
to exceed. One analysis from 2021 found that warming of 5.2°C would
likely result in a mass extinction event, even without considering the
other anthropogenic impacts on the Earth.63 Another study suggested that
the threshold for carbon release to result in a mass extinction event
would be crossed by most IPCC scenarios by the end of the century
(assuming a 50% uncertainty range, we may have already crossed this
precipice).64

Yet, these investigations suffer from the same problem, one that plagues
the entire study of global catastrophe and human extinction: a lack of
proven or reasonable tools and methods for discerning when a crisis
could spiral into global calamity. Few attempts have been made, with the
notable exception of the societal collapse and climate review conducted
by Richards et al., which does attempt to cautiously trace out some
pathways from impacts to conflict and mass mortality.65 Notably, these
deal only with climate change and not the broader, reinforcing web of
ecological crises, which has received less attention.

The short answer is that we do not know whether climate change or
anthropogenic ecological disruption could spiral into human extinction.
However, this is true for all the suspected causes of human extinction.
Climate and ecological crises do appear to have one of the most
concerning profiles, given their range of impacts, as well as their role
in past mass-extinction events and periods of historical turmoil. There
are enough reasons to take this question of human extinction from
ecological breakdown seriously.

For now, while uncertainty remains, it seems improbable that human
actions could extinguish the biosphere. Another mass-extinction event is
plausible, but complete annihilation of the biological realm is likely
not. Barring science fiction, the only semi-plausible direct route for
human activities to terminate all biological life is the triggering of a
runaway greenhouse effect. Lynas has suggested that such a scenario is
possible, if there are hidden, extreme positive feedback loops in the
climate system, an enormous, profligate use of fossil fuels, and
increasing solar radiation.66 Some basic modelling of the climate system
has suggested that a runaway greenhouse effect is plausible.67 This is
further supported by recent modelling of potential cloud feedbacks
leading to a moist greenhouse.68 However, these studies are based on
high-level models with many assumptions.

The current scientific consensus is that any hellish mechanism--- which
could lead to a furnace Earth, complete with evaporated oceans--- is
highly unlikely. In 2009, the IPCC reported, in its 31st meeting, that a
"runaway greenhouse effect" analogous to Venus appears to have virtually
no chance of being induced by anthropogenic activities.69 Whether this
view continues to hold, given the new modelling outcomes, is unclear.
For now, while extinguishing the entire web of life seems far less
likely than causing **[human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it is
an outcome that **[[cannot be]{.mark} entirely [ruled
out]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

If humans were to go extinct, it is likely that global ecological
collapse would be one of a series of drivers. **[Imagine]{.underline}**
a world where, in 2075, **[we have reached [4°]{.mark}C of
[warming]{.mark}. The climate system was more sensitive than
expected]{.underline}**, and new energy-hungry machine learning

**[My conclusion:]{.underline}**

**[This paper [fully neglects]{.mark}]{.underline}** the possible
**[developments of the human societies and economies past say

the effects of climate change are not everywhere visible and may not yet
be classified everywhere as dangerous.

Expectations of **[[what will happen when]{.mark} CO2 [emissions
continue]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the present level **[(around 40

happy]{.underline}** that **[[the]{.mark} vast [majority of
scientists]{.mark}]{.underline}** and policy makers in the world **[[are
not]{.mark} neglecting these possibilities]{.underline}** and are
developing policies to reduce the CO2 emission in time to prevent, what
is called \"dangerous climate change\".
**[[Studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** assessed by IPCC **[[show]{.mark}
that [expected effects]{.mark} at warming levels above
1.5]{.underline}** to 2 \'C **[[may be alarming]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The 195 Parties in the UNFCCC have decided that these expected effects
should be classified as \"dangerous\". So, also this qualification is a
political one, based on scientific studies that are fully neglected in
this paper.

Even if relevant in an analysis on the role of CO2 in the atmosphere, it
does not change the understanding of the influence of anthropogenic
emissions of CO2 on the atmospheric processes, since these anthropogenic
emissions did hardly occur prior to 1850.

Furthermore, the Little Ice Age was not a global phenomenon, but a
regional cooling, particularly in the North Atlantic region. For an

The IPCC AR6 summary for Policy makers shows that at the present levels
of global warming are still relatively moderate
(https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/figures/figure-spm-4). The problem
is that scientists expect these effects to get worse and worse the more
the CO2 concentrations will increase.

Yes, they are. But it is not their costs that causes climate change, it
is the physical properties of CO2 (infrared absorbance) that results in
disturbing the earth-space energy balance.

Studies show that this is probably due to the cooling effect of air
pollutants, primarily secondary aerosols. Since World War 2 air
pollution in the northern hemisphere was increasing considerably. In the
1970s and 1980s air pollution was abated and the cooling due to aerosols
decreased.

This is a misinterpretation of the relevant science. The correct war of
representing this is:

1\) The physical properties of CO2 (infrared absorbance) will lead to a
lower intensity of infrared radiation from the earth\'s surface towards
empty space when the atmospheric concentration of CO2 increases.

2\) Since there is no significant effect of CO2 on the intensity of the
incoming solar radiation heating the earth\'s surface, **[[the
effect]{.mark} of increasing CO2]{.underline}** concentrations
**[[is]{.mark} that [more energy]{.mark} remains]{.underline}** within
the earth\'s system the more CO2 is present in the atmosphere.

3\) The only way the earth\'s system can respond to this imbalance is to
increase the temperature of the earth\'s surface.

4\) The warmer earth surface **[will cause the climate to
warm]{.underline}**.

5\) **[There is an [overwhelming]{.mark} amount of [ev]{.mark}idence
available to [support this]{.mark}]{.underline}** explanation based on
fundamental physics. **[There is no proof of this explanation being
wrong. It has never been falsified. [Models]{.mark} have [been shown to

Again, a misinterpretation of climate science.

Svante Arrhenius (Arrhenius, S. (1896). On the influence of Carbonic
Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground. Philosophical
Magazine and Journal of Science, 41 (page 270), 237-279.
https://www.rsc.org/images/ Arrhenius 1896_tcmI 8-173546.pdf) already
derived the expected effects of increasing atmospheric C02 levels from
fundamental laws of physics.

Measurements of CO2 concentrations and global temperatures provide
strong evidence that these fundamental laws of physics indeed apply.
Furthermore, Arrhenius\'s estimate of the size of this effect is not far
from what present models predict and measurements confirm.

Nummer: 3 Auter: Tinus Pulles Onderwerp: Opmerking over tekst Datum:

This is only part of the story. Since CO2 absorbs outgoing infrared
radiation and immediately re-emits it in all directions, about half of
the absorbed infrared radiation is sent back to the earth\'s surface,
rather than into the empty space. This is independent of water vapor and
clouds. It happens everywhere in the atmosphere also in the
stratosphere! So the next sentence is wrong and not in line with the
fundamental laws of radiation.

Although the **[[strato]{.mark}sphere [cooling]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
this **[[does not prove]{.mark} that the near [surface
temp]{.mark}erature[s are not warming]{.mark} because of]{.underline}**
the effect of **[CO2]{.underline}** on the energy balance of the earth.

Different behavior of troposphere and stratosphere is a matter of
distribution of the energy over height. It is not showing anything on
the total energy within the total system.

Since specific heat content of air is very much lower than that of rocks
and oceans, the warming is caused indirectly by heat exchange between
the warming surface and the air above it. There is atmospheric warming
due to radiation only.

Even if true, this still does not falsify the theory derived from
fundamental physics that increasing CO2 concentrations must lead to a
higher temperature of the earth\'s surface and as a consequence thereof
to a warmer climate. Precisely as Svante Arrhenius already explained in
1896 (Svante Arrhenius (Arrhenius, S. (1896). On the influence of
Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground.

Even if these effects may not exceed natural variability, this does not
proof that they do not do so yet. Higher CO2 concentrations must result
in more of the solar energy absorbed by the earth\'s surface will remain
within the system and will warm the earth\'s surface. So if the effects
at present still are moderate as IPCC states
(https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/figures/figure-spm-4) the
expectation that they will be substantial when C02 concentrations keep
on increasing will be quite realistic.

This hypothesis has been published in 1986, including a first

[research supporting]{.mark}]{.underline}** ongoing climate change and
its dominant **[[anthro]{.mark}pogenic [drivers represents]{.mark} the
[sum of]{.mark} impressive scientific]{.underline}** efforts spanning
**[disciplines, continents, and [generations]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
investigators. Manheimer's arguments in the face of such abundant
evidence offers us as earth scientists an opportunity to demonstrate the
robustness and rigor of the basis for climate change.

Here we respond to the multitude of disparate issues raised by Manheimer
in his article, going through them one by one.

Claim 1: Climate change pins all the blame on fossil fuel emissions of
carbon dioxide even though the climate is a complex, poorly-understood
system dependant on many factors

Response: This view misrepresents climate science as attributing climate
change solely to CO2, which is not a claim that the earth science
community has ever made. To the contrary, anthropogenic climate change
represents the product of multiple human influences in addition to
fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide, including but not limited to
deforestation, release of chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide emissions,
tropospheric ozone, methane emissions from ruminant livestock and rice
paddies, and reductions in ice and snow reflectivity from emissions of
particulate black carbon.

Claim 2: Earth scientists propose the single solution of stopping fossil
fuel use, and do not even consider whether the climate effects of
ceasing CO2 emissions might be harmful.

Response: The research community neither suggests total cessation of
fossil fuel use, nor does reducing fossil fuel consumption represent the
sole solution to climate change. Some sectors of the global economy such
as steel manufacturing will likely prove very resistant to
decarbonization, and so a degree of continued fossil fuel use over the
21st century is in fact virtually guaranteed. Rather, climate change
mitigation relies upon achieving net zero emissions or better -- a state
where greenhouse gases are being added to the atmosphere at a lower rate
than they are being removed through natural and/or industrial means.
With world population projected to grow to 9-10 billion by mid-century
(Connor and Mínguez, 2012), future changes to agriculture will also play
a significant part in reducing humanity's climate impact. Finally, we
point out that suggesting that burning fossil fuels produces minimal
climate impact while in the next breath sowing fears about the negative
climate impacts of ceasing fossil fuel use is quite contradictory.

Claim 3: Glaciers have been receding for 200 years, therefore predating
industrial-era emissions of CO2. The Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland
that everyone thought was receding is in fact growing, according to a
recent study.

Response: Manheimer's claim that glaciers have been retreating for 200
years is uncited, making it difficult to ascertain where it originates
from. Very few glaciers worldwide have been accurately monitored for at
least two centuries. Manheimer may be referring to a recent study by
Dickens et al., which used oxygen isotope data as a proxy for glacial
discharge to identify an increasing trend in Antarctic ice shelf
thinning over the past 300 years (Dickens et al., 2019). If anything,
however, a longer-term trend of glacier retreat represents a cause for
more worry, not less, as such glaciers may have already been predisposed
to retreat prior to the onset of human-induced warming, suggesting that
climate change could significantly accelerate this pre-existing trend
(Dickens et al., 2019). Indeed, the World Glacier Monitoring Service has
reported demonstrable recent acceleration in the rate of ice mass loss
for the overwhelming majority of monitored glaciers in recent decades
(WGMS, 2013).

Manheimer fails to mention that the Jakobshavn glacier study's authors
believe that its recent growth is only temporary and attribute it to
natural cyclical variability in regional temperatures (Khazendar et al.,
2019). Prior to this shift to recent ice mass accumulation, the
Jakobshavn had retreated at an accelerating rate for two decades
(Khazendar et al., 2019), single-handedly contributing to an estimated
0.9 mm of global mean sea level rise between 2000 and 2010 (Howat et
al., 2011).

Claim 4: Looking at **[[surface temp]{.mark}erature
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the increase in global mean temperature
has **[[plateaued]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the past 20 years.

**[Response: To the contrary, [the reverse is
true]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Global surface
**[[temp]{.mark}erature[s]{.mark} have [continued to increase]{.mark}
over the past 20 years, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the rate of
**[[warming]{.mark} has]{.underline}** in fact **[[accelerated]{.mark}
over]{.underline}** the period from **[1998-2019]{.underline}**. The
plot **[[Manheimer]{.underline}]{.mark}** displays **[[is out-of-date,
only]{.mark} including data [up to]{.mark} \~[2014. The same
data]{.mark}set [extended]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the current day
**[[shows]{.mark} that the [warming]{.mark} trend has markedly
continued]{.underline}**. Interested readers can access the same
data themselves.

**[The rate of warming]{.underline}** over the past 20 years -- the
post-1998 period that was highlighted as a warming "hiatus" in the past,
**[[is now]{.mark} actually [faster]{.mark}]{.underline}** than the
three decades pre-1998.

#### BUT warming skeptics actually commit data fraud.

Mathematics from University of London, Associate Research Scientist at
Columbia University (Gavin Schmidt, January 28, 2024, "Spencer's
Shenanigans,"
https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2024/01/spencers-shenanigans/)

**[Our figure is [using annual]{.mark} mean [data]{.mark} rather than
monthly ([which is less noisy]{.mark}).]{.underline}** First, the
baseline is what it says on the box -- **[[there isn't an]{.mark} extra
[adjustment to exaggerate the]{.mark} difference in
[trends]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second, you can see the spread of the
models and see that the observations are well within it. Third, **[[the
impact]{.mark} of model selection]{.underline}** -- that screens the
models by their transient climate sensitivity Hausfather et al., 2022 --
**[[is]{.mark} also [clear]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the difference
between the pink and grey bands). To be quantitative, the observed trend
from 1980 0.20±0.02ºC/dec (95% CI on the OLS trend). The full
multi-model mean and spread is 0.26ºC/dec \[0.16,0.46\], while for the
screened subset it's 0.23ºC/dec \[0.16,0.31\]. Note that the SAT/SST
blend in the observations makes a small difference, as would a different
recipe for creating the mean from the individual simulations.

To conclude, **[the [observations lie]{.mark} completely [within]{.mark}
the spread of [the models, and]{.mark}]{.underline}** if you screen them
based on an independently constrained sensitivity, **[[the fit
is]{.mark} very [close.]{.mark} Reality 1: Spencer 0.]{.underline}**

Spencer's second figure reflects a more classic fallacy. The cherry
pick.

In this comparison, it suits **[[Spencer's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
purpose to include individual models,
**[[basically]{.underline}]{.mark}** because he's **[[skewed the]{.mark}
playing [field]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Why is this **[[only
showing]{.mark} summer [data, for 12]{.mark} US
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}** (I think Iowa, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota,
North Dakota, and Wisconsin) **[[and for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the odd
time period of
**[19[73-]{.mark}]{.underline}**20**[[22]{.underline}]{.mark}**? What
about other seasons and regions? **[\[[Curiously, 14]{.mark} out [of
the]{.mark} 36 [models]{.mark} shown [would have been screened
out]{.mark}]{.underline}** by the approach discussed in our Nature
commentary\]. We can perhaps gain some insight by plotting the global
summer trends from GISTEMP (though it doesn't really matter which
observational data set you use). In that figure, you can see that there
is minimum in the warming just to the south and west of the Great Lakes
-- corresponding pretty exactly to the region Spencer selected. The
warming rate there (around 0.12ºC/dec) is close to the minimum trend for
northern mid-latitudes and half of what you would have got for the
Pacific North West, or the South West, let alone anywhere in Europe!
Therefore it's the spot most conducive to showing the models overstating
warming -- anywhere else would not have had the same impact. **[Reality
2: Spencer 0.]{.underline}**

Back to the future

Spencer's third figure is a variation on an old theme. Again, there is
no indication that there is a spread in the models, only limited spread
in the observations, and no indication that there is an appropriate
selection to be made.

A better comparison would show the model spread, have a less distorting
baseline, and show the separate TLT datasets. Something like this
perhaps:

Now, this is the exact same model data that Spencer is using
(from McKitrick and Christy (2020) (though the screening uses the TCR
from our paper), and updated TLT satellite data. This does show a larger
discrepancy than at the surface (and only a minor improvement from the
screening) suggesting that there is something a bit different about the
TLT metric -- but far less than Spencer implies. So, Reality 3: Spencer
0.

Bottom lines

One final point. I don't criticize Spencer (and Christy before him)
because of any tribal or personal animosity, but rather it is because
appropriate comparisons between models and observations are the only way
to see what we need to work on and where there are remaining problems.
The key word is 'appropriate' -- if that isn't done we risk overfitting
on poorly constrained observations, or looking in the wrong places for
where the issues may lie. Readers may recall that we showed that a
broader exploration of the structural variations in the models
(including better representations of the stratosphere and ozone effects,
not included in the McKtrick and Christy selection), can make a big
difference to these metrics (Casas et al., 2022).

**[[Spencer's]{.mark} shenanigans are [designed to mislead]{.mark}
readers [about]{.mark} the likely [sources of]{.mark}]{.underline}** any
discrepancies **[and to imply that climate [modelers]{.mark} are
uninterested]{.underline}** in such comparisons -- and **[he is wrong on
both counts]{.underline}**.

BERLIN (AP) --- Humanity still has a chance, close to the last one,
**[[to prevent]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[the worst
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[climate change's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
future **[[harms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a top United Nations panel of
scientists said Monday. But doing so **[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}**
quickly **[[slashing carbon pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}** and fossil
fuel use **[[by nearly two-thirds by 2035]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said. The United Nations chief
said it more bluntly, calling for an end to new fossil fuel exploration
and rich countries quitting coal, oil and gas by 2040. "Humanity is on
thin ice --- and that ice is melting fast," United Nations
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. "**[Our world needs climate
action on all fronts]{.underline}** --- everything, everywhere, all at
once." Stepping up his pleas for action on fossil fuels, Guterres not
only called for "no new coal" but also for eliminating its use in rich
countries by 2030 and poor countries by 2040. He urged carbon-free
electricity generation in the developed world by 2035, meaning no
gas-fired power plants too. That date is key because nations soon have
to come up with goals for pollution reduction by 2035, according to the
Paris climate agreement. After contentious debate, the U.N. science
panel calculated and reported that to stay under the warming limit set
in Paris the world needs to cut 60% of its greenhouse gas emissions by
2035, compared with 2019, adding a new target not previously mentioned
in the six reports issued since 2018. "The choices and actions
implemented in this decade will have impacts for thousands of years,"
the report, said calling climate change "a threat to human well-being
and planetary health." "**[[We are not on the right track but it's not
too late]{.underline}]{.mark}**,'' said report co-author and water
scientist Aditi Mukherji. "Our intention is really a message of hope,
and not that of doomsday.'' With the world only a few tenths of a degree
away from the globally accepted goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees
Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, scientists
stressed a sense of urgency. The goal was adopted as part of the 2015
Paris climate agreement and the world has already warmed 1.1 degrees
Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit). This is likely the last warning the
Nobel Peace Prize-winning collection of scientists will be able to make
about the 1.5 mark because their next set of reports will likely come
after Earth has either breached the mark or locked into exceeding it
soon, several scientists, including report authors, told The Associated
Press. **[[After 1.5 degrees]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[[the
risks]{.underline}]{.mark}** are starting to **[[pile
on]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said report co-author Francis X. Johnson, a
climate, land and policy scientist at the Stockholm Environment
Institute. The report mentions
"https://apnews.com/article/science-climate-and-environment-10b36a73b486ed5c0bde05db4151ccb0″\>tipping
points" around that temperature of **[[species
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including **[coral
reefs]{.underline}**, **[[irreversible melting of
ice]{.underline}]{.mark}** sheets **[[and sea level
rise]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the order of several meters (several
yards). "The window is closing if emissions are not reduced as quickly
as possible," Johnson said in an interview. "Scientists are rather
alarmed." "1.5 is a critical critical limit, particularly for small
islands and mountain (communities) which depend on glaciers," said
Mukherji, who's also the climate change impact platform director at the
research institute CGIAR. Many scientists, including at least three
co-authors, said hitting 1.5 degrees is inevitable. "We are pretty much
locked into 1.5," said report co-author Malte Meinshausen, a climate
scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. "There's very
little way we will be able to avoid crossing 1.5 C sometime in the 2030s
" but the big issue is whether the temperature keeps rising from there
or stabilizes. Guterres insisted "the 1.5-degree limit is achievable."
Science panel chief Hoesung Lee said so far the world is far off course.
"This report confirms that if the current trends, current patterns of
consumption and production continues, then ... the global average 1.5
degrees temperature increase will be seen sometime in this decade," Lee
said. Scientists emphasize that the world, civilization or humanity
won't end if and when Earth hits and passes the 1.5 degree mark.
Mukherji said "it's not as if it's a cliff that we all fall off." But an
earlier IPCC report detailed how the harms -- from coral reef extinction
to Arctic sea ice absent summers to even nastier extreme weather -- are
much worse beyond 1.5 degrees of warming. "It is certainly prudent to be
planning for a future that's warmer than 1.5 degrees," said IPCC report
review editor Steven Rose, an economist at the Electric Power Research
Institute in the United States. If the world continues to use all the
fossil fuel-powered infrastructure either existing now or proposed Earth
will warm at least 2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, blowing
past the 1.5 mark, the report said. Because the report is based on data
from a few years ago, the **[calculations about fossil fuel projects
already in the pipeline do not include the increase in coal and natural
gas use after Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}**, said report
co-author Dipak Dasgupta, a climate economist at The Energy and
Resources Institute in India. The report comes a week after the Biden
Administration in the United States approved the huge Willow
oil-drilling project in Alaska, which could produce up to 180,000
barrels of oil a day. The report and the underlying discussions also
touch on the disparity between rich nations, which caused much of the
problem because carbon dioxide emissions from industrialization stay in
the air for more than a century, and poorer countries that get hit
harder by extreme weather. If the world is to achieve its climate goals,
poorer countries need a "many-fold" increase in financial help to adapt
to a warmer world and switch to non-polluting energy. Countries have
made financial pledges and promises of a damage compensation fund.
**[[If rich countries don't cut emissions quicker]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and better help victim nations adapt to future harms, "**[[the world is
relegating]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[least developed countries to
poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Madeline Diouf Sarr, chair of a
coalition of the poorest nations. The report offers hope if action is
taken, using the word "opportunity" nine times in a 27-page summary.
Though opportunity is overshadowed by 94 uses of the word "risk." The
head of the IPCC said the report contains "a message of hope in addition
to those various scientific findings about the tremendous damages and
also the losses that climate change has imposed on us and on the
planet." "There is a pathway that we can resolve these problems, and
this report provides a comprehensive overview of what actions we can
take to lead us into a much better, livable future," Lee told The
Associated Press. Lee was at pains to stress that it's not the panel's
job to tell countries what they should or shouldn't do to cap global
temperature rise at 1.5 Celsius. "It's up to each
**[[government]{.underline}]{.mark}** to find the best solution," he
said, adding that scientists hope those **[[solutions will stabilize the
globe]{.mark}'s temperature around 1.5 degrees.]{.underline}** Asked
whether this would be the last report to describe ways in which 1.5 C
can be achieved, Lee said it was impossible to predict what advances
might be made that could keep that target alive. "The possibility is
still there," he said. "It depends upon, again I want to emphasize that,
the political will to achieve that goal." Activists also found grains of
hope in the reports. "The findings of these reports can make us feel
disheartened about the slow pace of emissions reductions, the limited
transition to renewable energy and the growing, daily impact of the
climate crisis on children," said youth climate activist Vanessa Nakate,
a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. "But those children need us to read
this report and take action, not lose hope."

Not Ready to Remake the World Order

China has gained more ground from Trump's retreat to defend its values

"America First" and self-centered **[[unilateralism have

making it far easier for China to be seen as a responsible
stakeholder]{.underline}** in the world order. Distinguishing itself
from Trump's unilateralism that has thrown quite chaos and has torn away
the very bedrock of the postwar order under which, for all its faults,
China and many other countries have prospered mightily, **[[China has
continued to promote multilat]{.mark}eralism as it interpreted and
position itself as the global ballast and institution-builder
[by]{.mark} pledging to continue [supporting the WTO and
UN]{.mark}]{.underline}**, honoring the Paris Accord and other
international treaties and working together with other countries to
address global challenges.

[**[China has launched new initiatives and institutions]{.underline}**,
**[but they do not amount to replacing the existing

commentaries expressed **[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[China

However, **[[none of them has even been close to that]{.mark}

institution. The AIIB modeled the governance structure and standards of
established multilateral lending institutions, engaged former officials

clean, and green.\" Emphasizing transparency, accountability, openness,
and independence, AIIB adopted international norms and standards in line
with the practices of established institutions in environment, society,
disclosure, procurement, debt sustainability, and oversight mechanisms.

[**[As part of the postwar order]{.underline}**, **[not apart from

**[Proponents of the International Liberal order have spent much of its
lifespan trying to shield it from criticism.]{.underline}** They've
actively masked its shortcomings, dismissing any flaws and
Inconsistencies. A fortune has been spent on media influence campaigns
and another on military campaigns to re-inforce this ideal, all to keep
the rules based order well made up and hide any signs of cracking.
Whether these costly efforts to preserve the sanctity of the liberal
order were worth it as opposed to facing the reality of its challenges
remains an open question. But here we are, it did not work. At least not
in the way that the costume designers intended. The make-up still flaked
and the cracks still showed. But even then, the ever zealous stylists
insisted: the show must go- on.

Now, more countries are asking questions about the undisputed beauty of
the rules based order and predictably, those who spent years crafting
its reputation and covering up its shortcomings view this mere
questioning as an attack. They overreact because deep down they are
aware that the package they are marketing is not complete but hoped no
one else would notice or even dare to speak up about it. This
**[[panic]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[made [China's genuine
interrogation]{.mark} [of the liberal order come off as an]{.mark}
outright challenge and [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But China will
not relent and the global south has picked up the scent too.

In his book 21 lessons for the 21st century, Yuval Noah Harari argues
that many critics of the liberal system point out its problems but fail
to offer solutions. On this point, I beg to differ. **[[China has
offered a workable solution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[It's not pushing
for the overthrow of the]{.mark} liberal [system]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[but rather an upgrade]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[[China's
proposal]{.underline}]{.mark}** essentially **[[keeps]{.mark} many of
[the good things]{.mark} about the liberal order]{.underline}**;
**[[Free trade,]{.mark} international [institutions]{.mark}, cultural
exchange, [sovereignty]{.mark} and [non-aggression, democracy]{.mark}
and [human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**---at least in principle **[and
advocates for it to be more just and inclusive]{.underline}**. **[[It
recognizes]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} fundamental [problem]{.mark} of the
liberal order [lies in its western-centric
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[this nature]{.underline}**
automatically **[breeds structural inequality]{.underline}** for all the
rest. And that is China's biggest crime in the eyes of the liberal
order's stylists: insisting that the system live up to its aspirations.

The liberal order has seen inequality widen among and within nations.
The gap between the rich and the poor has significantly increased. When
it comes to income, the richest 10% globally make 52% of the global
income while the poorest half make only 8%. The wealth gap is even more
astounding with the richest 10% owning 76% of global wealth while the
poorest just owns 2%. This disparity extends to climate injustice. The
wealthiest nations emit more greenhouse gases in total and per capita
compared to the poorest nations and yet it's the latter that bear the
brunt of the consequences; floods, drought, food insecurity, and
displacement.

We have recently gone through a global pandemic that claimed millions
and tested the strength of global solidarity and are now facing a global
economic downturn coupled with a surge in regional conflicts that risk
escalating into something worse. The InfoTech and Biotech sectors are
increasingly running out of control of public oversight, unemployment
and the threat of future unemployment are on the rise and many countries
are now looking to build physical, economic and ideological walls
instead of bridges.

China, more than any nation seems to recognize this impasse and is
proposing an alternative approach to global political management.
China's current political ideology and system are always misunderstood
either deliberately or out of ignorance. The Chinese managed to borrow
the best ideas from ideological currents of the modern world;
Nationalism, communism and liberalism.

The Chinese are nationalists at the core with a strong identity that
they revere. They have adapted a 'socialism with Chinese
characteristics' that respects their unique identity and national
realities and have chosen to participate and contribute to the global
liberal order through their opening up and consistent advocacy for the
rule of law and respect to international institutions. The Chinese have
not made the mistake of assuming that one system is better than all and
fits all national contexts. They have applied logic to international
relations and let humans control the system instead of having systems
control humans. They have chosen ideological pragmatism instead of
ideological purity.

Should China continue on its current trajectory, it will avoid the
classic trap of ideology. Essentially, humans should inform and shape
ideology instead of ideology governing and informing humans. Ideologies
should evolve with new experiences, data and moral insight. When
ideologies inform humans, they risk becoming too rigid and form into
dogma. This creates a system that resists change, punishes dissent and
caters to the few. **[China's concept of whole process democracy caters
to all]{.underline}**---this is why it has had a lot of success with
lifting millions out of extreme poverty which is arguably the most
democratic outcome of our time.

On the other hand, the West's democratic systems or most liberal
democracies allow for endless democratic processes but often produce
very undemocratic outcomes. Question is; what's the point of choosing a
leader every four or so years if the life of most citizens remain
unchanged or even worsen? I propose we should adapt a system that would
give both in a form that respects national contexts.

**[[While the West has managed to democratize]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
some extent [**[internally]{.underline}**, **[this success has failed to
reflect on the international stage]{.underline}**.]{.mark} This could
simply indicate that while the liberal ideology in its pure form may
work most of the time within western societies, it needs some
adjustments when applied globally and within different national
contexts.

Currently, **[we are witnessing the logical conclusion of liberalism
within western societies]{.underline}**. Ironically, **[[it is
liberalism itself that enables the rise of illiberal
actors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[who reject the very system that
elevates them.]{.underline}** In other words, liberal societies can
elect a fascist or communist leader or leaders that generally reject
liberal norms. In theory, the system is designed to contain such
outcomes or their consequences through checks and balances but what
happens when a liberal system fails to contain illiberal ideas or allows
for its tenets to be dismantled from within? This is no longer a
hypothetical because current upheavals within Europe and the United
States indicate we are already at this stage of the equation.

#### China is [better]{.underline} for international order than the US.

to the Strategic Discourse on China's Rise, *Journal on Indo-Pacific
Affairs*, Winter 2019, Available Online at:
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/JIPA/journals/Volume-02_Issue-4/McKinney.pdf)

**[One of the most repeated ideas in international affairs
discourse]{.underline}** today **[is that after World War II the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[created a "free and
open international order"]{.underline}** **[and that this order has been
responsible for keeping the Indo-Pacific "largely peaceful" for the last
80 years.]{.underline}**4 **[China is then typically said to be
promoting a vision "incompatible" with this
order]{.underline}**---something that should make us worry, as it may
herald the return of violent power politics.5

Michael Lind has summarized the perspective:"in my experience, most
members of **[the U.S. foreign policy elite sincerely believe that the
alternative to perpetual U.S. world domination is chaos and
war]{.underline}**."6 It is indeed true that the years since World War
II have been peaceful when compared with most of European history and
that violence of all kinds has declined.7 **[This phenomenon has been
dubbed the "New Peace,"]{.underline}** and the United States certainly
played some role in bringing it about.8

**[However, [there is no consensus]{.mark} among scholars [to what
extent US]{.mark} actions---or more abstractly, the supposed
["order"---contributed to the decline in war]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
violence. **[Existing academic explanations stress the role
of]{.underline}** **[[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** restraining
states from major war;9 the evolution of territorial norms (as well as
regimes and institutions, like the United Nations);10 the development of
globalized markets and "trading states";11 the longer-term spread of
reason, sympathy, and feminization alongside the rise of stronger
states;12 **[the settlement of territorial disputes after World War
II]{.underline}**;13 the spread of democracies;14 **[the declining
utility of war as a rational instrument of statecraft]{.underline}**;15
and hegemonic stability, which emphasizes (in its liberal form) how the
United States helped create global institutions and shape norms16 and
(in its "realist" form) how US power has deterred or compelled rivals to
behave.17 This is not the place to judge between the various
explanations, but it should be clear that they are diverse and the
overall explanation is likely multivariate. Only the realist version of
hegemonic stability directly supports the narrative of the free and open
international order. Christopher **[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
recently **[sought to test the theory by looking at the changing pattern
of global peace/violence relative to US military
spending]{.underline}**, frequency of intervention, and selection of
grand strategy across four presidential administrations (Bush Sr. to
Obama). **[He [found no relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}** at all. "As
it stands," he concluded, "**[the only evidence we have regarding the
[relationship between US power and international stability suggests that
the two are unrelated]{.mark}]{.underline}**."18 **[If US officials and
strategic pundits are going to claim that peace is dependent on an
abstract order created and maintained by American power, they need to
provide serious evidence]{.underline}** for their claims. Until then,
while we can be thankful that the United States contributed to postwar
institutions like the United Nations, helped delegitimize colonialism,
and did not abuse its power (as much) as many other states would have,
policy makers and scholars should be highly skeptical of more sweeping
claims.

Laying aside the question of how the New Peace came about, **[another
oft repeated notion is that China is determined to undermine the
contemporary international order]{.underline}**, according to Friedberg,
by corrupting, subverting, and exploiting it.19 **[The proof for this
claim is generally said to be]{.underline}** China's "militarization" of
the South China Sea (SCS) through **["salami-slicing" and "grey-zone
tactics,"20 and occasionally, a retired Chinese official]{.underline}**
or Global Times commentator **[is quoted as representative of
China's]{.underline}** official (even if unarticulated) policy and
**[intentions]{.underline}**. In the abstract, such claims are
alarming---in context, and in balance, rather humdrum. In fact, **[[the
evidence of any Chinese intention to destroy]{.mark}, or even merely
undermine and exploit, [the current order is
slight]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China is certainly using its growing
military power to defend its claims in the SCS and even---on occasion---
to coerce its neighbors. It uses protectionist economic policies to
boost the prospects of Chinese companies and reduce competition. It
employs economic statecraft to serve its interests abroad. And it
certainly is opposed to America's policy of global democracy promotion.
**[However, [none of these positions fundamentally challenge the
existing order, none of them radically depart
from]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[America's own
actions]{.underline}**]{.mark} when it was a rising power in the
nineteenth century, **[and none of them obviously surpass [America's own
contemporary record of order subversion]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[When the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[was a rising power, it took half of
Mexico]{.underline}** and considered taking the rest, it
[**[colonized]{.underline}** **[the Philippines and
Hawaii]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[and]{.underline}** it **[unilaterally
seized the maritime choke points of the Caribbean]{.underline}** (Puerto
Rico and Cuba).21 **[The U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[used tariffs]{.underline}**---which by 1857 averaged 20 percent22 and
by the end of the nineteenth century were "the highest import duties in
the industrial world"23---to protect its industries. It **[stole
intellectual property]{.underline}**,24 **[and]{.underline}** it
**[ideologically challenged the governments of the "Old
World."]{.underline}** **[Today]{.underline}**, despite no longer being
a rising power, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[**[has launched two disastrous invasions]{.underline}**, **[tortured
prisoners]{.underline}**, **[and dispatches drone strikes at a whim with
little international legal authority]{.underline}**]{.mark}.25 The point
is not that two wrongs make a right; it is that international order is
much more resilient than critics seem to realize,26 and it is utopian to
expect any rising Great Power to act in a way that uniformly satisfies
one's moral scruples, evolving, in Friedberg's words, "into a mellow,
satisfied, 'responsible' status quo power."27

Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took place in the
context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but the more
important point is that the long nineteenth century (1815--1914)---the
era of America's rise---was the first iteration of the New Peace.28 The
implication is that relative peace can and has coexisted with limited
wars, property and territorial thefts, acts of coercion, and aggressive
assertions of status. This does not mean any of these are desirable---
they are not---but it shows that they need not be fatal to the system.
Insofar as there is a lesson from that first period of relative peace,
it is that Great Power confrontation is the one thing that is fatal.
Accepting this does not mean capitulating in every instance, as implied
by some,29 but it does mean rediscovering the rules of Great Power
competition30 alongside the art of strategy.31

Focusing only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the
established powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which China, has,
in fact, conformed to the existing order. As a RAND Corporation report
published in 2018 concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a
conditional one---of the international order: "Since China undertook a
policy of international engagement in the 1980s . . . the level and
quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most other
states."32 The way in which **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping,
following his 2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, **[[has
been heralded as the most prominent champion of international
order]{.underline}]{.mark}** and defender of globalization
**[underscores the fact that there are different elements of this order,
and that [China supports many]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if not most,
**[[of them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Even in places where China is
supposedly "altering" the current order, [Beijing tends to
simultaneously affirm that order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[China's
A]{.underline}**sian **[I]{.underline}**nfrastructure
**[I]{.underline}**nvestment **[B]{.underline}**ank, for instance,
actually mirrors existing structures, and China has intentionally
**[copied]{.underline}** elements and "best practices" of **[[the World
Bank]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Asian Development Bank. **[China is

#### China doesn't threaten the world order

**Odell 21**, (Rachel, "Why **[it\'s [wrong for the US to label China a
threat to the \'world order']{.mark}]{.underline}**, Responsible
Statecraft,
https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/03/20/why-its-wrong-for-the-us-to-label-china-a-threat-to-the-world-order/)

A meeting hailed as a chance to "air divisive issues" and stabilize
relations between the United States and China quickly devolved into
finger-pointing and recriminations by officials on both sides, spelling
trouble for a relationship increasingly defined by hostility and
conflict.

Addressing a group of high-level Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska
on March 18, Secretary of State Antony Blinken excoriated Chinese
officials for actions that "threaten the rules-based order that
maintains global stability." Director of the Office of the Central
Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi reciprocated with accusations
of condescension and interference in China's internal affairs.

Blinken's characterization of China as a threat to a "rules-based order"
echoes his administration's language in its Interim National Security
Strategic Guidance released March 3, as well as the Trump
administration's 2017 National Security Strategy, which labeled China an
existential threat to the U.S.-led, "free and open" world order.

While the Biden administration's China policy has improved somewhat on
the Trump administration's approach by highlighting the need for U.S.
domestic reform and admitting the need for cooperation with China in
some areas, its embrace of this conception of the international system,
or "world order," and the U.S. and Chinese relationships to it is overly
simplistic --- and dangerously **[misleading]{.underline}**.

This **[rhetoric reflects Washington's tendency to [imagine]{.mark} the
[current world order as]{.mark} a [monolithic]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
liberal system of mutually-reinforcing laws, norms, institutions, and
alliances, **[upheld by the United States and its allies. In this view,
states like China and Russia seek to overthrow this order and replace it
with one that is more lawless and repressive]{.underline}**.

But **[[this is]{.mark} deeply [misleading]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[No such version]{.mark} of a world order [has ever existed, nor has
the relationship of]{.mark} the United States --- or its
[adversaries]{.mark} --- to the present order ever [been]{.mark} so
[simple]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[this misconception is
perilous]{.underline}**. **[Vastly [overstating]{.mark} the nature of
[China's challenge]{.mark} to the current "world order" stands
to]{.underline}** hinder vital U.S.-China cooperation on issues like
climate change, **[[fuel]{.mark} a massive and [harmful overreaction in
American]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[foreign policy]{.mark},
and]{.underline}** in the worst case could **[[force China to assume a
more aggressive]{.mark} and revisionist [posture]{.mark} than it
otherwise would]{.underline}**.

Instead of adopting this dangerous course, **[the administration should
recognize the reality of [world order]{.mark}: that it [is]{.mark} in
fact [a series of separate and sometimes]{.mark} [contradictory
orders]{.mark}]{.underline}**, governing areas from trade, to arms
control, to international humanitarian law. **[Like the United States,
China has varying relationships with each of these
orders]{.underline}**, as Alastair Iain Johnston of Harvard University
writes --- **[upholding some, while rejecting or seeking to change
others]{.underline}**.

Climate change, for instance, is an area that demands a cooperative
international regime for both decarbonization and disaster relief and
mitigation. It is one where collaboration with China is readily
possible. China has recently positioned itself as a leader on climate,
upholding the Paris Agreement and adopting a goal of carbon neutrality
by 2060. As the world's two largest economies, the United States and
China can lead by adopting even more ambitious goals for
decarbonization, and can provide financial and technology assistance to
developing countries to accelerate their transition to carbon neutrality
and build their climate resilience.

Similarly, in the international development regime, China is creating
new institutions and initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative, but there is room for
Washington and Beijing to coordinate productively in those contexts.

In other regimes, such as freedom of navigation, there is room for the
United States, China, and other countries to negotiate compromise
agreements to clarify existing ambiguity in international law. To
support its global naval primacy, the United States asserts a maximal
version of freedom of navigation, insisting that military vessels have
the right to "fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows."
Washington interprets the extent of that right more expansively than
most countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including many U.S. allies
and partners.

Despite U.S. rhetoric, China is not seeking to threaten freedom of
navigation for commercial vessels, upon which its economy heavily
depends. Even in the military realm, China, like the United States, is
increasingly dependent on freedom of navigation for its own warships
operating farther from its shores. If the United States were to reduce
the tempo of its surveillance operations along China's coast and freedom
of navigation operations near disputed South China Sea islands, China
would likely express stronger support for military freedom of navigation
given its own growing naval power. Meanwhile, Washington and Beijing
could work with other countries throughout the Indo-Pacific to reach a
compromise understanding about the rights of foreign military vessels in
exclusive economic zones.

Of course, China's approach to other aspects of the law of the sea
regime related to marine resources is more revisionist. This is most
evident in its ill-defined claim to historic rights in the South China
Sea and its claim to resources in vast swaths of ocean space around
groups of small disputed offshore islands. These excessive claims merit
pushback, but the United States should follow ASEAN's lead in calling
for the South China Sea disputes to be resolved in accordance with
UNCLOS, rather than conducting unilateral freedom of navigation
operations that risk destabilizing the situation.

Finally, in the global regimes related to human rights and domestic
governance, the United States should counter China's influence by
deepening its engagement to strengthen and reform those regimes. In
regimes that are not yet fully formed, such as internet governance,
China is trying to shape norms in ways that favor state sovereignty and
control. The United States should vigorously defend its own prerogatives
and priorities in this regime --- some of which it has yet to sort out
at a domestic level, but which ought to entail a more open and less
government-dominated approach to internet governance.

In other areas where China is acting as a conservative power resisting
liberal norm revision, such as with its resistance to the
"responsibility to protect" norm, the United States should emphasize the
need for the international community to work together to respond to
gross humanitarian violations. At the same time, Washington should
recognize that its heavy use of economic sanctions to punish human
rights abuses and its militarized humanitarian interventions not only
often cause direct unintended humanitarian harm, but also have the
predictable consequence of strengthening resistance to such liberal norm
revision. If Washington desires to strengthen liberal human rights
norms, it ought to adopt a more liberal diplomacy-centric approach that
relies on soft power and modeling, in lieu of economic and military
coercion.

As **[the United States]{.underline}** seeks to adapt to a more
multipolar global system and an increasingly powerful and important
China, it **[should [avoid]{.mark} the both [inaccurate and harmful
portrayal of China]{.mark} as a threat to the overall world
order.]{.underline}** **[A more fine-grained understanding and less
Manichean rhetoric will help the United States make better
strategy]{.underline}** --- **[avoiding Cold War-style competition,
while identifying where to focus our efforts in both working with and
against the Chinese government]{.underline}**.

**[[The U]{.mark}S diplomatic philosophy]{.underline}** in international

This alternative approach raises questions about political legitimacy as
well. **[Western commentators often claim that Chinese people support
their government only out of fear]{.underline}**. But
**[research]{.underline}** like the Anthropology of Democracy (AoD)
project --- recently shared by Jason Hickel --- **[challenges that
assumptio]{.underline}**n. Using anonymised, bias-reducing survey
methods, the study finds that **[[Chinese citizens express exceptionally

--- **[but we don't]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For example, only 50% of
Russians in the same survey said they believed their country was
democratic.

**[Many people struggle with the idea that China could be seen as

[Western definition of democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- one **[that
[focuses exclusively on]{.mark} multi-party

different in form, the system seeks to institutionalise responsiveness

The era of **[American [hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which dominated
global affairs since 1945 and reached its peak after 1991, **[is [coming
to an end]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[rather than lament
this]{.underline}** shift, **[[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}** and the
world **[[should embrace]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[opportunities]{.mark} it presents]{.underline}**.

For too long, **[the U.S. has shouldered]{.underline}** the burden of
**[global policing]{.underline}**, tied to the notion of **[maintaining
a "[rules-based]{.mark}]{.underline}** international
**[[order]{.underline}]{.mark}**" **[that [is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
increasingly **[[irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The end of this era
opens the door to **[a]{.underline}** more just, prosperous and
**[[realistic]{.mark} world order]{.underline}** --- one that **[is
[based on balancing]{.mark}]{.underline}** global **[powers rather than
dominating them]{.underline}**. It's time for the U.S. to adopt a grand
strategy of restraint, rooted in realist international relations theory,
and reshape its role in a multipolar world.

The decline of American hegemony has been a gradual process, accelerated
by major events but always rooted in deeper structural trends. The rise
of other global powers has challenged the ability of the U.S. to control
world affairs. **[The myth that Washington]{.underline}** believed after
the Cold War, that it **[could dictate global governance]{.underline}**
indefinitely, **[was]{.underline}** always **[an illusion.
Overreach]{.underline}** in military interventions, **[coupled with
domestic and international challenges]{.underline}**, have **[weakened
American primacy.]{.underline}**

**[The]{.underline}** international system that the U.S. helped build
after World War II --- a **[system of]{.underline}** multilateral
institutions and **[liberal norms]{.underline}** --- has **[shown cracks
for years]{.underline}**. This was not a neutral or benevolent
framework; it was a structure that **[served American
interests]{.underline}**, often **[at the expense of
other]{.underline}** nation**[s]{.underline}**.

Now, with rising competition from other powers, the idea that Washington
can --- or should --- continue to act as the global enforcer is not only
unrealistic but also **[counterproductive]{.underline}**. **[Clinging to
hegemony leads]{.underline}** only **[to]{.underline}** more **[costly
interventions and strategic failures]{.underline}**, as evidenced by
recent decades of U.S. foreign policy.

The end of American hegemony is not a catastrophe but an opportunity to
adopt a more restrained and realistic approach to international
relations. A grand strategy of restraint, as grounded in realist theory,
recognizes the limitations of U.S. power and the dangers of
overextension.

Realism --- with its focus on national interest, the balance of power
and the inevitability of competition among states --- offers a clear
path forward. Rather than attempt to dominate or impose an ideological
framework on the world, the U.S. should focus on protecting its core
interests while avoiding unnecessary entanglements.

**[[In a multipolar world]{.mark}, the [U.S]{.mark}. should be
[one]{.mark}]{.underline}** power **[[among many]{.mark}. The key to
maintaining security]{.underline}** and stability **[is]{.underline}**
not through imposing American leadership but **[through
balance]{.underline}** --- **[[engaging in]{.mark} selective competition
and [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** with other powers, without
trying to dominate them. This shift away from hegemony opens space for
new coalitions and more flexible partnerships based on mutual interest
rather than unilateral dominance.

As China rises and challenges American influence, it is tempting for
policymakers to frame the situation as a new Cold War, with China
replacing the Soviet Union as the primary adversary. But this is a
flawed analogy. The Cold War was a unique ideological and military
struggle between two superpowers, and trying to apply that same logic
today only invites dangerous escalation. **[The U.S. should not attempt
to]{.underline}** "**[contain]{.underline}**" **[China]{.underline}** in
the traditional sense of the word, which would only provoke
confrontation without serving U.S. interests.

Instead, Washington should pursue a strategy of "blunting" --- using its
power and influence to prevent any one nation from dominating key
regions or setting the rules of global governance. This realist approach
acknowledges that while **[[China's rise]{.mark} cannot be stopped, it
[can be managed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The U.S. should work with allies
and regional powers to ensure that Beijing's ambitions do not come at
the expense of American security or that of its partners. **[By focusing
on]{.underline}** maintaining a **[balance of power, the U.S. can
prevent Chinese domination]{.underline}** without overextending itself
in futile efforts at containment.

**[Blunting is]{.underline}** not about imposing America's will on the
world, but about **[ensuring]{.underline}** that **[no]{.underline}**
other **[power can impose its will]{.underline}**. This strategy
recognizes that the global order is shifting, and Washington's role
should be **[one of prudent management rather than aggressive
intervention]{.underline}**. Realist restraint means recognizing that
the U.S. cannot and should not be involved in every conflict, nor can it
dictate terms to every rising power.

The end of American hegemony liberates the U.S. from the yoke of global
policing, which it has borne to its own detriment for far too long. A
grand strategy of restraint would prioritize America's core national
interests, avoiding the costly and unnecessary interventions that
characterized much of its foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. The
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan illustrate the dangers of overreach and the
futility of trying to impose democratic values through military means.

**[[Restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[is not
isolationism]{.mark}. The U.S. still has [critical
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** that require engagement, particularly
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** key regions like **[the [Indo-Pacific and
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But engagement must be guided by a sober
assessment of American power and the realistic limits of influence.
Realist theory teaches that international relations are governed by
competition among states, and in a multipolar world, **[[the
U.S]{.mark}. must [pick]{.mark}]{.underline}** its **[[battles
carefully]{.underline}]{.mark}**, choosing to intervene only where its
vital interests are at stake.

**[This]{.underline}** strategic recalibration **[would
allow]{.underline}** America to play **[a smarter role in world
affairs]{.underline}** --- working with allies when necessary, but not
leading every charge. The notion that any instability anywhere in the
world threatens U.S. security is no longer tenable, nor is the belief
that the U.S. must bear the burden of global governance alone.

The shift away from American hegemony opens the door to a more
sustainable world order that reflects the multipolar character of
contemporary international politics. This transition is a natural
evolution of the international system, and the U.S. must adapt by
embracing restraint and realism as the guiding principles of its foreign
policy.

In a more multipolar world order, **[smaller powers and regional
actors]{.underline}** will **[have greater agency]{.underline}**, and
multilateral **[cooperation]{.underline}** will be **[driven by shared
interests rather than imposed]{.underline}** norms. The U.S. has an
opportunity to lead by example instead of through coercion. By focusing
on blunting the more extreme ambitions of illiberal powers like China,
Washington can help shape a world that is more stable and equitable.

**[The age of U.S. dominance is over]{.underline}**, but that is not a
cause for alarm. It is a chance to build a more just and prosperous
international system --- one grounded in the realities of power politics
and the recognition that **[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather
than overreach, **[is [the path to]{.mark} sustainable
[security]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Nesrine Malik offers a powerful and clear-eyed perspective in her recent
piece, "**[It]{.underline}** **[is difficult to imagine a post-American
world. But imagine it we must]{.underline}**." She doesn't shy away from
the discomfort such a shift entails, but instead leans into it with
honesty and vision. Malik writes:

"Ironically, this all might be the beginning of a process that leads to
genuine 'liberation days' for other countries, but not the US itself.
There is pain ahead, but also a sort of independence."

Malik exposes the long-standing myth of American exceptionalism,
reminding us that **[[what the U.S. has long defined as "peace and
prosperity" was]{.underline}]{.mark}** in fact a version [**[crafted to
serve its own interests]{.underline}**, **[imposed through power and
propaganda]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Malik's call to imagine otherwise is
not only necessary; it is liberating and essential.

It's well-documented (or should be) that since the 1950s, **[[the U.S.
has actively overthrown governments]{.mark} in Latin America, the Middle
East, Africa, and Asia]{.underline}**. Iran in 1953. Guatemala in 1954.
Indonesia in 1965. Chile in 1973. The list goes on. The aim? To install
regimes that protect U.S. corporate and strategic interests and keep
trade flowing in dollars.

**[When violent coups and wars became too costly]{.underline}** --- or
too unpopular --- **[the strategy shifted to [economic
warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and World Bank began offering "help" in the form of structural
adjustment programs: austerity, deregulation, privatisation, and forced
trade liberalisation. **[These policies [devastated local
economies]{.mark}, dismantled public sectors, and locked countries into
cycles of debt and dependency.]{.underline}**

This is the world system we live in today --- and one that continues to
uphold inequality, exploitation, and neocolonial power relations.

What about China?

It's difficult to talk about U.S. hegemony without bringing China into
the conversation. [**[Much of the narrative around China's growing
economic influence frames it as an aggressive takeover]{.underline}**
**[--- but that]{.underline}**]{.mark} analysis [**[misses a crucial
point]{.underline}**: **[the foundation for China's expanding market
share was]{.underline}** **[laid by decades of U.S.-led neoliberal
policies.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

Under the banner of free markets and deregulation, the U.S. pushed for
the liberalisation of global trade, the offshoring of industrial
capacity, and the privatisation of critical infrastructure across the
world. This global restructuring, driven by profit maximization and
minimal state intervention, hollowed out domestic industries and
weakened democratic control over strategic sectors.

As a result, Chinese companies --- backed by a more state-coordinated
economic strategy --- have stepped into the void. From
telecommunications to green tech, they are not simply "invading"
markets; they are capitalising on the very system the U.S. helped build
and enforce.

These developments didn't happen in a vacuum. They are the result of
decades of neoliberal policy: deregulation, privatisation, and a
market-first ideology driven by the U.S. and its institutional allies
--- the IMF, EU, and World Bank. So if we're alarmed by China acquiring
ports or power grids, we should also ask: why is that even possible in
the first place? Through U.S. imposed neoliberalism.

Let's be clear: China is no utopia. But its rise has disrupted the
dominant Western narrative of how development must work and who it must
serve.

China's political system does have problems and internal contradictions
that must be overcome and labour conditions can be harsh, and the
treatment of ethnic minorities remains a serious concern. But at the
same time, it's impossible to ignore the scale of China's achievements:
a country of nearly 1.4 billion people that has lifted hundreds of
millions out of poverty, expanded access to housing, healthcare, and
education, and built infrastructure at an unprecedented pace.

These transformations are rooted not in free-market capitalism, but in a
state-led model shaped by China's revolutionary socialist foundations
--- which is to be celebrated.

That matters --- because it challenges Western assumptions about what
development must look like, and who it must serve.

The difference between socialist and capitalist systems matters
profoundly especially when assessing poverty. Socialist policies often
keep the cost of meeting basic needs low in ways that conventional
price-based poverty measures don't capture. This was the case in China.
Before the market reforms of the 1980s and '90s, the government provided
food, housing, and basic services at little to no cost. In that context,
US\$1.90 (extreme poverty) a day stretched much further in China than in
comparable capitalist countries. Research shows that over the past 40
years the numbers of people in China living in extreme poverty fell by
almost 800 million.

A few researchers analysed OECD data and came to the conclusion that
extreme poverty was lower in China than in countries like India,
Indonesia, and Brazil during the 1980s. China consistently outperformed
these countries on life expectancy, infant and child mortality, average
years of schooling, and access to electricity.

The researcher's acknowledges that extreme poverty is difficult to
measure with precision. But the overall picture suggests that China's
transition toward market liberalisation may have worsened poverty
temporarily. To combat this China government made state-led efforts in
recent decades which reversed those trends. The government has since
invested heavily in poverty alleviation, housing, and public services,
reaffirming its commitment to some of its foundational goals.

**[As China's global power has grown, so too has the debate around what
kind of hegemon it may become.]{.underline}** [**[Unlike the U.S., China
does not maintain hundreds of military bases]{.underline}**, **[nor has
it relied on drone warfare or regime change]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to
project influence]{.underline}**. **[Instead, [it exerts power
through]{.mark}]{.underline}** trade, infrastructure, and economic
**[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- most notably through the Belt
and Road Initiative. **[This is still power]{.underline}**, still
strategic, still potentially coercive --- **[but]{.underline}** it
**[signals a shift from military domination to economic
interdependence.]{.underline}**

#### Decline motivates [restraint]{.underline} and peace, [not]{.underline} violent wars.

**MacDonald** & Parent **18**, \*PhD, Associate Professor of Political
Science at Wellesley College. \*\*PhD, Associate Professor of Political
Science at the University of Notre Dame. (Paul K. and Joseph M.,
"Twilight of the Titans: Great Power Decline and Retrenchment", pg. 2-3,
Published by *Cornell University Press*)

In this book, we argue that **[[the conventional wisdom is
wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specifically, we make three main
arguments. First, relative **[[decline causes prompt, proportionate
retrenchment because states seek strategic
solvency]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The international system is a
competitive place, and great powers did not get to the top by being
imprudent, irrational, or irresponsible]{.underline}**. When their
fortunes ebb, states tend to retain the virtues that made them great.
**[In the face of decline, [great powers have a good sense of their
relative capability]{.mark} and tend not to give away more than they
must]{.underline}**. Expanding or **[[maintaining grand strategic
ambitions during decline incurs unsustainable burdens and incites
unwinnable fights]{.underline}]{.mark}**, so the faster states fall, the
more they retrench. Great powers may choose to retrench in other
circumstances as well, but they have an overriding incentive to do so
when confronted by relative decline. Second, the depth of **[[relative
decline shapes]{.mark} not only [how much a state retrenches,
but]{.mark} also [which policies it
adopts]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The world is complex and
cutthroat; leaders cannot glibly pull a policy off the shelf and expect
desired outcomes. Because international politics is a self-help system,
great powers prefer policies that rely less on the actions of allies and
adversaries. For lack of a better term, we refer to these as domestic
policies, which include reducing spending, restructuring forces, and
reforming institutions---all to reallocate resources for more efficient
uses. But **[international policies]{.underline}** may also help, and
they **[include [redeploying forces, defusing flashpoints, and
redistributing burdens]{.mark}---all to [avoid costly conflicts and
reinforce core strongpoints]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The faster and
deeper states fall, the more they are willing to rely on others to
cushion their fall. Retrenchment is not a weapon but an arsenal that can
be used in different amounts and combinations depending on conditions
and the enemies faced. Third, after depth, structural conditions are the
most important factors shaping how great powers respond to relative
decline. Four conditions catalyze the incentives for declining states to
retrench. One is the declining state's rank. States in the top rungs of
the great power hierarchy have more resources and margin for error than
those lower down, so there is less urgency for them to retrench. Another
is the availability of allies. Where states can shift burdens to capable
regional powers with similar preferences, retrenchment is less risky and
difficult. Yet another is the interdependence of commitments. When
states perceive commitments in one place as tightly linked to
commitments elsewhere, pulling back becomes harder and less likely. The
last catalyst is the calculus of conquest. If aggression pays, then
retrenchment does not, and great powers will be loath to do it. The
world is not just complex and cutthroat, it is also dynamic. No set of
conditions is everlasting, and leaders must change with the times.
Empirically, **[this work aims to add value by being the first to study
systematically all modern shifts in the great power pecking
order]{.underline}**. **[[We find sixteen cases of relative
decline]{.mark} since 1870]{.underline}**, when reliable data for the
great powers become available, **[and compare them to their
non-declining counterparts across a variety of measures]{.underline}**.
To preview the findings, **[[retrenchment is by far the most common
response to relative decline]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and declining
powers behave differently from non-declining powers. States in decline
are more likely to cut the size of their military forces and budgets and
in extreme cases are more likely to form alliances. This does not,
however, make them ripe for exploitation; declining states perform
comparatively well in militarized disputes. Our headline finding,
however, is that states that retrench recover their prior rank with some
regularity, but those that fail to retrench never do. These results
challenge theories of grand strategy and war, offer guidance to
policymakers, and indicate overlooked paths to peace.

#### Fears of transition wars are a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}\-\--parity is [far more peaceful]{.underline} than dominance.

**McKinney 19**, PhD from Singapore's Nanyang Technological University
(Jared Morgan, How to avoid a contest for supremacy in East Asia,
Comparative Strategy, 38:4, 316-326, DOI: 10.1080/01495933.2019.1633183)

\[PTT = Power Transition Theory\]

This fear is widely held.17 Insofar as a strategist accepts the
theoretical assumption that the international system is hierarchical and
constituted by the rise and fall of dominant/ hegemonic states,18 this
fear is warranted. Historical evidence indicates that war becomes more
likely in conditions of power parity,19 and a world without U.S.
dominance is likely to be more illiberal in noticeable ways.20 So much
for the better angels of our nature.21 **[Given this dilemma, America's
new consensus is that it is time for the U.S. to "get tough" and to
"stand up" to China]{.underline}**.22 **[That this requires unlearning
the lessons of the First World War]{.underline}** (i.e., **[the danger
of inadvertent escalation]{.underline}**) **[is simply a cost to be paid
in the quest to win the contest for supremacy]{.underline}**.23 If the
choice is either to compete in Asia to maintain America's hegemony or to
cravenly leave24 for the sake of peace---surrendering it to the
Chinese---only the first option realistically matches America's
(supposedly) deeply rooted attachment to the region25 and deepseated
phobia of appeasement.26 Honest balancers, such as John Mearsheimer,
acknowledge that **[staying in the region to compete for [hegemony comes
with a very serious risk of major-power war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even
if neither side sought intentionally to cause such a war, the "lessons"
of the First World War suggest that **[[competitive risk-taking
can]{.underline}]{.mark}** occasionally **[[get out of hand]{.mark},
and]{.underline}** a great **[war]{.underline}**---neither quite
intentional nor quite accidental---**[can materialize]{.underline}**.27
What should be "almost unthinkable" in an age of nuclear weapons28
remains quite possible, for, as the annals of history demonstrate,
**[political leaders are not]{.underline}** consistently "prudent,
enlightened, far-sighted, and **[peaceloving]{.underline}**." 29 **[Far
from coolly calculating interests, [leaders]{.mark} are well known to
[act intuitively and]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[emotionally]{.underline}**]{.mark},30 to choose war even when it is
"materially inefficient," 31 **[[to prefer catastrophic defeat to
humiliation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,32 **[to be [obsessed with national
prestige]{.mark}]{.underline}**,33 **[[and]{.mark} to [fight
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[status]{.underline}**]{.mark}.34 **[This
is the "stuff" of international politics]{.underline}**, and anyone who
blindly implies the contrary has not seriously grappled either with the
historical record or the ever-growing body of scholarship on the many
paths to war.35 **[[Risking major-power war]{.mark} may [make sense if
the only alternative is]{.mark} U.S. [dominance]{.mark} or Chinese
dominance]{.underline}**.36 But this is a false dichotomy. **[In fact,
[PTT is fundamentally flawed]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[both conceptually
and historically]{.underline}**. **[Conceptually, the [theory
ignores]{.mark} the obvious possibility [that approximate parity can be
a *destination*]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[just as well as it can be a
mere waypoint.]{.underline}** **[Making international politics about
"supremacy" is as likely to create a contest for supremacy as it is to
describe one]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[Historically, PTT vastly
overstates the evidence supposedly in its favor]{.underline}**.
Hegemonic wars do take place.37 However, such wars seem to require
certain structural conditions. These include the emergence of
technologies that can give certain states a large lead, the existence of
powerful enabling ideologies (e.g., monotheism38 or Nazism39) and the
material significance of land and mass labor in generating wealth and
power.40 That being said, **[PTT's most common illustrations for
"hegemonic war"]{.underline}**---**[the Peloponnesian War and the First
World War]{.underline}**---**[only support the theory in]{.underline}**
the **[vague]{.underline}**st of **[manners]{.underline}**. In 431,
**[Athens can be said to have acted from hubris and Sparta from
honor]{.underline}**;41 **[in 1914, Russia---not Germany---was seen as
the rising and unstoppable colossus]{.underline}**.42 In both cases,
**[war developed out of a confluence of international structures, the
actions of allies/clients, and chance]{.underline}**. **[[It is far from
clear that the theory of "hegemonic war" actually explains
anything]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[about these cases]{.underline}**.43

**[[Some might hope]{.mark} that [Trump's alienation
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** US **[[allies can be
reversed]{.underline}]{.mark}** under the next administration. **[[Don't
bet on it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Regardless of how Trump's tariff war
plays out, **[the damage to the idea of the West has already been
done]{.underline}**. As European Commission President Ursula von der
Leyenput it, "the West as we knew it no longer exists." The Liberal
Party's astonishing comeback in Canada shows the depth of that country's
revulsion vis-à-vis the US. Relationships that were shredded overnight
will take years to rebuild.

**[[Might Trump still strengthen the US]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even as
he weakens the West[**[?]{.underline}** **[Don't bet on that,
either]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[Not only have America's]{.underline}**
friends and **[[allies lost faith]{.underline}]{.mark}** in it as a
reliable security or trading partner; **[[they will constantly wonder
what other]{.mark} resources and [concessions the US might try to

[concerns]{.mark} [will weaken the]{.mark} alliance [system that has
always given the West a decisive edge over]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russia
and **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Though **[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as Japan, Saudi Arabia,
South Korea, India, and Singapore are not going to cut security ties
with the US, they and others **[[will]{.mark} be tempted to
[reduce]{.mark} their [dependence on America]{.mark} and improve ties
with others. Trump's foreign policy will]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[lead to more hedging or non-alignment.]{.underline}** The European
Union, for example, will seek to expand its partnerships with
non-Western emerging powers such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South
Africa, and Turkey.

At the same time, **[[Trump's policies]{.mark} could strengthen the
momentum behind groupings like]{.underline}** the
**[BRICS]{.underline}**, which recently added five new members, bringing
the total to ten. **[They also [will enhance the appeal of]{.mark}
[arrangements that include China but not the US]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
For example, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, an
Asia-Pacific free-trade agreement that includes US partners and allies
such as Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, could become a
significant global player, as is also true of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank, which brings together China, India, Britain, Germany,
and Italy.

**[Such extra-American cooperation]{.underline}**, already seen in the
Law of the Sea, the International Criminal Court, and the Paris climate
agreement, **[will gain even more traction in a Trumpian
world]{.underline}**. **[[The]{.mark} new US [administration is]{.mark}
rapidly [undercutting]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only Western dominance,
but also **[[America's]{.underline}]{.mark}** own **[global
[influence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Trump is sure to encourage different
combinations of rising powers, middle powers, regional influencers, and

#### USAID cuts thump

Wisconsin-Madison. (Alfred McCoy, 6-3-2025, "President Trump Is
Demolishing America's Global Soft Power" *The Nation*

\*modified for ableist langauge

Even in these uncertain times, one thing seems clear enough: Donald
**[[Trump's]{.mark} sharp [cuts]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** this country's **[[humanitarian
aid]{.mark} will]{.underline}** **[[ensure]{.mark} that [its soft power
crumbles]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[doing lasting damage to]{.mark} its
international [standing]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The Logic of Foreign Aid

**[Foreign aid]{.underline}**---giving away money to help other nations
develop their economies---**[remains one of America's greatest
inventions]{.underline}**. In the aftermath of World War II, Europe had
been ravaged by six years of warfare, including the dropping of
2,453,000 tons of Allied bombs on its cities, after which the rubble was
raked thanks to merciless ground combat that killed 40 million people
and left millions more at the edge of starvation.

Speaking before a crowd of 15,000 packed into Harvard Yard for
commencement in June 1947, less than two years after that war ended,
Secretary of State George Marshall made an historic proposal that would
win him the Nobel Peace Prize. "It is logical," he said, "that the
United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the
return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can
be no political stability and no assured peace." Instead of the usual
victor's demand for reparations or revenge, the US gave Europe,
including its defeated Axis powers, \$13 billion in foreign aid that
would, within a decade, launch that ruined continent on a path toward
unprecedented prosperity.

What came to be known as **[the Marshall Plan was]{.underline}** such
**[a brilliant success]{.underline}** that Washington decided to apply
the idea on a global scale. Over the next quarter century, as a third of
humanity emerged from the immiseration of colonial rule in Africa and
Asia, the United States launched aid programs designed to develop the
fundamentals of nationhood denied to those countries during the imperial
age. Under the leadership of President John F. Kennedy, who had
campaigned on a promise to aid Africa's recovery from colonial rule,
disparate programs were consolidated into the US Agency for
International Development (USAID) in 1961.

At the outset, USAID's work was complicated by Washington's Cold War
mission. It would sometimes even serve as a cover for CIA operations.
Just a few years after the Cold War ended in 1991, however, USAID was
separated from the State Department and its diplomatic aim of advancing
US interests.

Then refocused on its prime mission of global economic development,
USAID would, in concert with the World Bank and other development
agencies, become a pioneering partner in a multifaceted global effort to
improve living conditions for the majority of humanity. Between 1950 and
2018, the portion of the world's population living in "extreme poverty"
(on \$1.90 per day) dropped dramatically from 53 percent to just 9
percent. Simultaneously, USAID and similar agencies collaborated with
the U.N.'s World Health Organization to eradicate smallpox and radically
reduce polio, ending pandemics that had been the scourge of humanity for
centuries. Launched in 1988, the anti-polio campaign, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention estimates, spared 20 million children
worldwide from serious paralysis.

Behind such seemingly simple statistics, however, lay years of work by
skilled **[[USAID]{.mark} specialists]{.underline}** in agriculture,
nutrition, public health, sanitation, and governance who delivered a
multifaceted array of programs with exceptional efficiency. Not only
would their work improve or **[save millions of lives]{.underline}**;
**[they would also be [winning]{.mark} loyal [allies for America at a
time of rising global competition]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

And Along Comes DOGE

Enter Elon Musk, chain saw in hand. Following President Trump's example
of withdrawing from the World Health Organization on inauguration day,
Musk started his demolition of the federal government by, as he put it,
"feeding USAID into the wood chipper." As his DOGE hirelings prowled the
agency's headquarters in the weeks after inauguration, Musk denounced
that largely humanitarian organization as "evil" and a "viper's nest of
radical-left Marxists who hate America." Without a scintilla of
evidence, he added, "USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to
die."

With head-spinning speed, his minions then stripped the USAID logo from
its federal building, shut down its website, purged its 10,000
employees, and started slashing its \$40 billion budget for delivering
aid to more than 100 nations globally. The White House also quickly
transferred what was left of that agency back to the State Department,
where Secretary of State Marco Rubio spent six weeks slashing 83 percent
of its global humanitarian programs, reducing 6,200 of them to about
1,000.

As USAID's skilled specialists in famine prevention, public health, and
governance stopped working, the pain was soon felt around the world,
particularly among mothers and children. In Colombia, the agency had
spent several billion dollars to settle a decades-long civil war that
killed 450,000 people by mapping 3.2 million acres of uncharted lands so
that the guerrillas could become farmers. That work, however, was
suddenly halted dead in its tracks---project incomplete, money wasted,
threat of civil conflict again rising. In Asia, the end of USAID support
forced the World Food Program to cut by half the already stringent food
rations being provided to the million Rohingya refugees confined in
miserable, muddy camps in Bangladesh---forcing them to survive on just
\$6 a month per person.

In Africa, the aid cuts are likely to prove catastrophic. Departing
USAID officials calculated that they would be likely to produce a 30
percent spike in tuberculosis, a deadly infectious disease that already
kills 1.25 million people annually on this planet and that 200,000 more
children would likely be paralyzed by polio within a decade. In the
eastern Congo, where a civil war fueled by competition over that
region's rare-earth minerals has raged for nearly 30 years, the United
States was the "ultra dominant" donor. With USAID now shut down, 7.8
million Congolese war refugees are likely to lose food aid and 2.3
million children will suffer from malnutrition. In war-torn Sudan, US
aid sustained more than 1,000 communal kitchens to feed refugees, all of
which have now closed without any replacements.

With 25 million of the world's 40 million HIV patients in Africa, cuts
to USAID's health programs there, which had reduced new infections by
half since 2010, now threaten that progress. In South Africa, half a
million AIDS patients are projected to die, and in Congo, an estimated
15,000 people could die within the next month alone. Moreover, ending
USAID's Malaria Initiative, which has spent \$9 billion since President
George W. Bush launched it in 2005, essentially ensures that, within a
year, there will be 18 million more malaria infections in West Africa
and 166,000 more likely deaths.

On March 3, with such dismal statistics piling up, Elon Musk insisted
that "no one has died as a result of a brief pause to do a sanity check
on foreign aid funding. No one."

Writing from Sudan just 12 days later, however, New York Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof reported that Peter Donde, a 10-year-old child infected
with AIDS at birth, had just died. A USAID program launched by President
Bush called PEPFAR had long provided drugs that were estimated to have
saved 26 million lives from AIDS (Peter's among them) until Musk's cuts
closed the humanitarian agency. Kristof reported that the end of US
funding for AIDS treatment in Africa means "an estimated 1,650,000
people could die within a year without American foreign aid." Why, he
asked, should Americans spend even 0.24 percent of their Gross National
Product on programs that keep poor children alive? Answering his own
question, he wrote that the demolition of USAID "means that the United
States loses soft power and China gains."

Indeed, Dr. Diana Putman, USAID's former assistant administrator for
Africa, argues that the agency's programs have been the chief currency
for US ambassadors in negotiations with developing nations. "Their
leverage and ability to make a difference in terms of foreign policy,"
she explained, "is backed up by the money that they bring, and in the
Global South that money is primarily the money that USAID has."

The Loss of Soft Power

In short, globally, **[[the]{.mark} sharp [cuts]{.mark} to USAID's
humanitarian programs [represent a]{.mark}]{.underline}**
~~crippling~~\[**[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[[blow to
America's soft power at a time when]{.mark} great-power [competition
with Beijing]{.mark} and Moscow [has reemerged]{.mark} with stunning
intensity.]{.underline}**

In back-handed testimonials to USAID's success, the world's autocrats
celebrated the agency's demise, particularly the end of the \$1.6
billion---about 4 percent of its annual budget---that it devoted to
pro-democracy initiatives. "Smart move," said former Russian Prime
Minister Dmitri Medvedev. On X (formerly Twitter), Hungarian strongman
Viktor Orbán announced that he "couldn't be happier that \@POTUS,
\@JDVance, \@elonmusk are finally taking down this foreign interference
machine." Expressing his joy, Orbán offered a "Good riddance!" to USAID
programs that helped "independent media thrive" and funneled funds to
the "opposition campaign" in Hungary's 2022 parliamentary elections.
Similarly, El Salvador's de facto dictator, Nayib Bukele, complained
that USAID's pro-democracy funds had been "funneled into opposition
groups, NGOs with political agendas, and destabilizing movements."

Offering even more eloquent testimony to USAID's past efficacy,
**[[China has moved quickly to take over a number of]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} abolished [agency's]{.mark} humanitarian
[programs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, particularly in Southeast Asia, where
Beijing is locked in an intense strategic rivalry with Washington over
the South China Sea. Writing in the journal Foreign Affairs, two public
health specialists observed that "**[[a U.S. retreat on global
health]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if sustained,
**[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}** indeed **[[open the door for China to
exploit the]{.mark} abrupt, chaotic [withdrawal of U.S.
programs]{.mark}]{.underline}** in...Southeast Asia, and it may do the
same in Latin America."

American soft power recovered after low points during the Vietnam and

#### Trump is tearing down US soft power faster than it can be rebuilt

wtk

But **[as]{.underline}** US President Donald **[[Trump]{.mark}'s second
term unfolds]{.underline}**, **[his administration [is]{.mark}
openly]{.underline}** and deliberately
**[[dismantling]{.underline}]{.mark}** the foundations of **[[American
soft power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, **[Trump seems to
believe in democracy only when it works in his favor]{.underline}**,
**[showing little]{.underline}** understanding -- or
**[regard]{.underline}** -- **[for]{.underline}** the **[checks and
balances]{.underline}** that protect democratic systems from devolving
into raw majoritarianism.

**[Unlike every postwar US president before him, [Trump has the
instincts of an authoritarian ruler]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and he
governs accordingly. On the international stage, he seems more
comfortable dealing with the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin
than with America's traditional democratic allies.

To make matters worse, **[Trump has surrounded himself with sycophants
who eagerly echo whatever they believe he wants to hear]{.underline}**.
His occasional cabinet meetings are cringe-inducing displays of
obsequiousness by senior administration officials. The level of
deference is as astonishing as it is embarrassing. A prime example is
Secretary of State Marco Rubio's disgraceful description of Germany as a
disguised dictatorship for designating the far-right Alternative für
Deutschland (AfD) as an extremist party.

At a recent cabinet meeting marking Trump's first 100 days in office,
Vice President J.D. Vance acted as toady-in-chief. For some politicians,
integrity is a small price to pay for power. Once a vocal critic who
called Trump "America's Hitler," Vance has long since decided that he
prefers to stand beside actual fascists and authoritarian strongmen.

Unsurprisingly, Trump was the only one at that cabinet meeting to
address America's faltering economy. But rather than taking
responsibility for the consequences of his own disastrous policies, he
shifted the blame to his predecessor, Joe Biden -- despite inheriting
robust GDP growth and a booming stock market.

**[Trump's chaotic economic agenda rests on two main
pillars]{.underline}**. **[The first is]{.underline}** the belief --
championed by chainsaw-waving billionaire Elon Musk -- **[that trillions
of dollars can be saved by [eliminating government
waste]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** that deep
cuts are needed to finance **[[tax cuts]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the
rich. Never mind that **[these cuts disproportionately harm the poorest
Americans or gut essential foreign-aid programs]{.underline}** that help
millions of people -- and help advance US interests -- around the world.

**[The geopolitical implications [could be
far-reaching]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[As [the US slashes aid
budgets]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[China is stepping in to fill the
void]{.underline}**, **[expanding its influence in Africa and Southeast
Asia]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[through increased aid and
investment]{.underline}**. Consequently, **[China's popularity is rising
across the developing world while America's is in free
fall.]{.underline}**

**[The second pillar]{.underline}** of Trump's economic policy
**[is]{.underline}** the imposition of sweeping
**[tariffs]{.underline}** on nearly every major trading partner, often
based on flimsy or bizarre justifications. The likely outcome is not
just a global slowdown but a potential domestic recession, as indicated
by the 0.3% decline in US GDP in the first quarter of 2025, compared to
2.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, the last of Biden's
presidency.

This raises a critical question: **[Who benefits from Trump's
authoritarianism?]{.underline}** America's universities -- arguably the
best in the world -- are under attack whenever their research challenges
the administration's ideological positions or simply provokes Trump's
anger. The chilling effect is already visible, with outspoken Trump
critics like historian Timothy Snyder and philosopher Jason Stanley
departing for universities outside the US.

**[Free speech]{.underline}**, which Trump and Musk have pretended to
care about, **[is]{.underline}** also **[under threat]{.underline}**.
Media organizations that fail to toe the Republican Party line have been
targeted, even as some of their billionaire owners have cravenly
capitulated to Trump. **[The administration has also flouted the rule of
law, attacking judges who question]{.underline}** the
**[legality]{.underline}** of its actions while trying to roll back
fundamental, constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties, especially due
process.

What does this mean for the values that once made America admired around
the world? Has the shining "city on the hill" been reduced,
metaphorically, to the kind of rubble we now see in Gaza and Ukraine?
While I still have faith that the US and its people can reverse course,
**[[rebuilding the US-led]{.mark} international [order is going to take
far longer than the time it has taken Trump to tear it
down.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

wtk

**[[The U.S. has no ability to oblige]{.mark} the [Nordic countries to
disengage with China]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Expelling Chinese power from the Arctic]{.underline}** and preventing
China from gaining a foothold in the Nordic region **[is one of the
goals of U.S. Arctic strategy]{.underline}**. In recent years, the U.S.
has strengthened its control over the Nordic countries through military
and intelligence cooperation, constantly forced the Nordic countries to
disengage from China and attempted to exclude China from the Nordic
region while controlling the Nordic countries at the same time. But
**[the [complementary economic structures between]{.mark} the [Nordic
countries and China]{.mark} as well as the attractiveness of Chinese
funding and infrastructure technology [makes disengagement
impractical]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Nordic countries will lose
diplomatic autonomy if they blindly follow the US instruction. They will
miss the opportunity to ride the Chinese development train.

Globally, **[it has been the goal of U.S. policymakers to push the U.S.
and its allies to disengage with China]{.underline}** in the areas of
economic trade, technology, and education. This aim replicates the Cold
War era when they ganged up and disintegrated the Soviet Union. Some
experts call it the "New Cold War." Such theorists argue that China will
collapse if it is excluded from the current international system and
prevented from benefiting from the world trading system and
technological development -- as what happened with the Soviet Union.
However, **[policymakers holding this assumption do not realize the
difference between today's China and the Soviet Union of the Cold War
era. China manufactures large amounts of industrial goods]{.underline}**
for the world every day, **[and has the largest and most comprehensive
industrial system in the world.]{.underline}** **[Even the United States
is not yet able to decouple from China]{.underline}**. Despite
escalating national security tensions, trade between the United States
and China hit a record high in 2022, with the bilateral goods trade
between the countries rising to \$690.6 billion, according to official
U.S. data, topping the previous record of \$658.8 billion in 2018.
Exports to China increased by \$2.4 billion to \$153.8 billion, while
imports of Chinese products rose by \$31.8 billion to \$536.8 billion,
according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.9)

The U.S. sanctions against China inevitably lead to damage to its
allies' economic systems. In President Joe Biden's 2023 State of the
Union address, the U.S. leader announced that it wants to begin a trade
embargo against allies: "Tonight, I'm announcing new standards that all
construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects must be
made in the United States. America-made lumber, glass, gypsum board and
fiber optic cable. American roads, American bridges and American
highways will be made with American products." U.S. alliance policy is
filled with a plethora of inherent contradictions, such as targeting the
embargo on products made by allies -- harming the interests of allies.
Will the U.S. policy succeed in defending "Made in America" and
excluding Chinese and U.S. ally products? History and facts have proved
its failure. As long as China insists on "equality and mutual benefit"
and continues to strengthen the trade ties with the world, and if the
U.S. allies can benefit from trade with China, the policy of containing
and isolating China is doomed to failure. Britain, France, West Germany,
Japan and Canada traded with the Soviet Union despite the Iron Curtain
during the Cold War. There is a similar situation with China today. At
the request of Russia, the UN Security Council held a public meeting on
February 21, 2023 for the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion of last
September. The convening nations discussed launching an international
investigation of the Nord Stream II explosion. The results of the
investigation may continue to tear apart the US-led Atlantic alliance
system.

**[Because the U.S. shares more of the same political-economic values as
the Nordic countries, [China has never expected the Nordic countries to
side with China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[nor expected the Nordic
countries to betray the United States.]{.underline}** **[[What China
plans to do is to ignite Nordic countries' ideals for higher standards
of living]{.mark}, to awaken their inspiration for national dignity and
their dream for independent policy making.]{.underline}** **[[Nobody can
stop people's aspiration for a better life once it is
ignited]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The elites and populations of the Nordic
countries have the natural right to pursue higher levels of economic
development, higher-level industrial structures and more autonomous
national strategies. **[[If the U.S. attempts to]{.mark} forcefully
[separate these countries from China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including
commercial and academic exchanges between both sides, **[[it
may]{.underline}]{.mark}** instead [**[stimulate]{.underline}**
**[greater interest in their exchanges with China]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[and raise the cost of U.S. control over]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[since it is]{.underline}**
**[impossible to cut off the Nordic countries from
China]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the information age.

The U.S. Nordic policy will eventually bite back at itself

The U.S. is a capitalist country, and the principle of confrontation
with China in the Nordic region is subject to hegemonic and economic
interests. The costs of competing with China in the Nordic region have
to be calculated and balanced. Confrontation with China can only be
profitable and sustainable if the benefits outweigh the costs. Once the
costs are higher than the benefits, it will be difficult for the U.S. to
sustain the competition. The profit-seeking properties of capital
dictates a strong internal countervailing force which will make the U.S.
tired of dealing with it. According to the analyses of Hillary Clinton,
China has the advantage of a more powerful political system than the
United States, which controls fewer national resources than China.
"We'll never beat China unless 'we take back the means of
production.'"10) China can utilize more resources and compete with the
U.S. at any cost, but the U.S. political system cannot do so. Due to the
political system advantages, China will be the last winner in the Nordic
competing with the U.S.

According to Chinese Taoism, "Reversion is the action of
Tao（反者道之动)", which means that things may develop in the opposite
direction of the will, and that strengths and weaknesses can be
transformed into each other. U.S. Arctic policy is falling into the trap
of "Reversion is the action of Tao" by aggravating friends, helping
adversaries, and hurting itself. The result of oppressing allies and
sacrificing their interests blindly is to push them toward China.

**[The U.S. is falling into a trap and vicious cycle. The greater the
effort to boycott China, the greater the price it has to pay and the
greater the loss it will suffe]{.underline}**r. Any miscalculation will
push the U.S.' allies toward China, which adhere to the principle of
mutual benefit and win-win. The disastrous effects of U.S. policy are
not visible now, but they will be in the future. **[[The Nordic
countries could maintain and increase cooperation with the U.S.]{.mark}
rationally, [while strengthening their ties with China which adhere to
win-win cooperation]{.mark} and keeping its promises, and obtain
practical benefits and national dignity in the face of power
competition]{.underline}**. For the United States, the only way out is
to either give up the vicious competition with China or cooperate with
China to maintain peace and prosperity in the North Atlantic and Arctic.

**[With many commentators eulogizing the liberal international
order]{.underline}** that had hitherto underpinned US hegemony, **[some
are wondering if]{.underline}** President Donald **[Trump has
given]{.underline}** his Chinese counterpart, **[Xi]{.underline}**
Jinping, **[a gift.]{.underline}** While Trump prizes unpredictability,
Xi aims to position China as a force for global stability. Thus,
**[there is a widespread assumption that China will rush to fill the
vacuum]{.underline}** left by an increasingly nationalist and
isolationist United States.

**[But the [Chinese leadership has no interest in filling America's
shoes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Attempting to do so could cost
China]{.underline}]{.mark}** dearly just when it is undertaking a
broader economic reorientation at home. **[The world may be tired of US
interventionism]{.underline}** -- and, now, of Trumpian aggression --
**[but that does not mean it is ready to welcome an abstemious
superpower]{.underline}**. **[[China has]{.underline}]{.mark}**
studiously [**[avoided becoming involved]{.underline}** **[in major
crises]{.underline}**]{.mark} beyond its immediate neighborhood. Though
it has proposed global initiatives on "development," "security," and
"civilization," and articulated a vision of multipolarity in which all
countries are treated equally, its efforts to realize these goals have
not gone beyond economic statecraft.

**[While foreign commentators debate what China's vision
entails]{.underline}** -- with some describing it as a potentially
benevolent hegemon, and others as a malevolent one -- **[Chinese
authorities]{.underline}** and intellectuals **[are more immediately
concerned with weathering the storm that Trump has
unleashed]{.underline}**.

China's Core Interests

Independent commentators and Chinese leaders alike have long pondered
the same question: **[What are China's core national interests? Viewed
from outside]{.underline}**, **[the answer seems]{.underline}**
straightforward: **[to [replace the US]{.mark} as global
leader]{.underline}**. **[But pursuing that role [may contradict other
core interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as maintaining regime
legitimacy and security, orchestrating a continuous rise in living
standards, and reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. These goals might
best be served by maintaining a cold peace with the US, rather than
embracing conflict with it.

Having watched the US, **[[China knows]{.mark} all too well [that being
a global superpower would]{.mark}]{.underline}** inevitably **[[draw it
into regional conflagrations that it would prefer to
avoid]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But **[China]{.underline}** also
**[knows]{.underline}** that **[it has benefited massively from
the]{.underline}** relatively **[stable world economy]{.underline}**
that the US and its allies helped bring about.

**[[China needs to retain enormous amounts of resources and manpower
domestically to tackle its biggest challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Chinese leaders must manage an economy that is no longer driven
primarily by property development and exports, while preparing for the
possibility that one of its largest trading partners could descend into
total isolation. Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs and escalatory duties
in response to Chinese countermeasures were a wake-up call. Whatever
happens in the trade war, China urgently needs to rebalance its economy
by stimulating greater domestic demand.

#### They won't exercise even [partial]{.underline} leadership

No Pax Sinica

Looking ahead, **[[China would face]{.mark} three big [challenges in
pursuing even partial]{.mark}]{.underline}** or limited global
**[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, **[[given
America's]{.mark} accelerated [withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}** from
international affairs, **[[China might struggle to sustain its
commercial engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** with many parts of the
world. After all, **[the US wants to impose drastic costs on those who
do business with China]{.underline}**, and it may well get its way.

Second, **[China cannot avoid engagement in dangerous security
situations forever]{.underline}**. Sooner or later, it will have to
develop a truly global foreign policy. In fact, **[simply [putting its
own]{.mark} Global [Security Initiative]{.mark} [into practice would
require it to do much more heavy lifting]{.mark}]{.underline}**, not
only in setting the agenda but also in terms of deploying security
personnel and resources. How China approaches this challenge will depend
on how others perceive it and respond to its bids for limited
international leadership. **[[America may be retreating, but that does
not mean it will]{.mark} sit idly by and [watch China]{.mark} try to
[increase its own influence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Third, **[[China still needs to orchestrate]{.mark} a domestic [economic
rebalancing]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- a process that will have enormous
global consequences. Shifting from export-led growth to greater domestic
consumption will take years, and **[[the push to rebalance may run up
against China's ambition to remain a global manufacturing
powerhouse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The latter objective is already
causing tensions with Europe and some developing countries whose
domestic manufacturers are struggling to compete with Chinese national
champions (such as the electric-vehicle maker BYD). **[Countries may
abhor US tariff coercion]{.underline}**, **[but they are also wary of
Chinese competition]{.underline}**. Chinese leaders will need to "read
the room" and proceed accordingly.

Thus, [**[even as its economy continues to grow]{.underline}**, **[China
will remain a largely self-centered and reluctant
superpowe]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[r.]{.underline}** **[Unlike the
US]{.underline}**, [**[its domestic political economy calls for
a]{.underline}** **[more restrained foreign
policy]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[focused primarily on its immediate
neighbors and commercial opportunities in the Global
South.]{.underline}**

China as Military Peer Competitor in the Arctic?

**[[The Arctic is not]{.mark} as central or [important to China]{.mark}
as the writings of many Western Arctic commentators might
suggest]{.underline}**. **[[Beijing's]{.mark} main [preoccupations are
still closer to home]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan still represents
the PLA's main strategic direction]{.underline}**, **[with other clear
priorities including the E]{.underline}**ast **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea, the **[S]{.underline}**outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea, **[and China's
borders]{.underline}** with India and North Korea.45 The PLA's
priorities, as expressed by its shipbuilding and force design, certainly
demonstrate this focus on China's near-abroad (Taiwan and taking full
control of the disputed waters of the South China Sea in particular). In
short, **[the closer a region is to China, the more important it is to
Beijing]{.underline}**, with Chinese strategists viewing the world as a
series of concentric circles of decreasing priority. **[[Beyond Asia,
Chinese attention is given to Africa, Europe, and then the
Americas]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While this means China will risk
undertaking provocative actions closer to home, such as military
exercises near Taiwan or the PLA's construction and fortification of
artificial islands in the South China Sea, it does not mean China will
do so in the comparatively distant Arctic.46

**[[Given the small Chinese footprint in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and hypothetical military threat in or
through the Arctic, what accounts for the vigor with which many
political and academic commentators insist that the United States and
its Arctic state allies must mount a military response to China in the
region? **[[Narratives]{.mark} tend to [conflate]{.mark} the
more]{.underline}** [**[hypothetical]{.underline}**
**[risk]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that China poses]{.underline}** as an
international actor **[in the Arctic]{.underline}** [**[with
the]{.underline}** **[real]{.underline}** **[risk]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[that Beijing already poses as a regional actor in the
Pacific]{.underline}**. The danger is that over-inflated or misplaced
fears about China's military threat to and in the Arctic may prove to be
a strategic distraction, diverting Arctic states' attention and defense
resources from elsewhere.47 In this sense, prematurely elevating China
to military peer or near-peer competitor status in the Arctic can divert
attention from parts of the world where the PRC's capabilities and
interests actually warrant such status.

Within the Chinese bureaucracy, the polar regions are formally
categorized as maritime affairs. Accordingly, Beijing's emerging Arctic
strategy is part of China's maritime strategy, and policy documents show
that China's growing Arctic interests reflect the growing importance
that Beijing attaches to maritime affairs.48 China's rapid economic rise
has fueled its military modernization, but sober analysis shows that
very little of this effort has been applied to the Arctic.49 China began
commissioning a series of ice-capable patrol boats in 2016, though these
were not designed for polar ice conditions. China also has two
icebreakers that can work through up to 1.5 meters of ice. These,
however, are unarmed.50 The so-called icebreaker gap between China and
the United States is more the result of commentators attempting to shame
US decision makers into recapitalizing America's own fleet than about
Chinese scientific vessels posing threat. **[China has few aircraft that
could reach the Arctic, and the]{.underline}** People's Liberation Army
Navy's (**[PLAN]{.underline}**) **[nuclear submarine fleet is small and
ill-equipped for under-ice operations]{.underline}**.51 Ultimately,
**[we see [China's ability to project military power into the
Arctic]{.mark} as [minimal]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[a fact unlikely
to change in]{.mark} the foreseeable future]{.underline}** **[[because
of the limited strategic gains]{.mark} to be had in the region compared
to commensurate energies invested in other parts of the
world]{.underline}**.52

A rational calculus of the threat that the Chinese military might pose
to Arctic states yields modest risks in even the worst-case scenario. In
2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decried China's "pattern of
aggressive behavior" around the world and raised the prospective of PLAN
submarines operating under the ice-cap.53 However, as Adam Lajeunesse
and Tim Choi have argued, the use of North American waters by Chinese
submarines for regular operations is unlikely given the lack of
attractive targets in the region, the danger of moving ballistic missile
submarines (SSBN) through the Bering Strait, the geographical
constraints on Chinese sea control or denial of the region, and the
limitations of the Northwest Passage as a route to move joint forces to
Asian theaters.54

A preoccupation with Chinese icebreakers or even submarines as
capabilities designed to challenge Arctic sovereignty or launch attacks
against the Arctic states may miss the larger picture. Growing strategic
competition between China and the United States affects all the Arctic
states, but the epicenter of their competition remains the Indo-Pacific
region. The danger in overestimating China's Arctic military capability
is that such a narrow fixation draws resources away from the real center
of gravity in Sino-Western competition. Along these lines, Beijing may
anticipate that any display of Chinese military interest or capability
in the region will draw a disproportionate response from the Arctic
states. Accordingly, the Arctic may present an enticing opportunity for
China to feign strategic interest and bait Arctic states to over-invest
in or over-commit capabilities to that region rather than elsewhere in
the world. In short, the Arctic offers potential advantage as a
diversionary theater.55 In contrast to other commentators'
representation of the Arctic as a theater of primary and particular
interest for the Chinese,56 we suggest that Chinese strategy and
behavior in the Arctic are best appreciated as a part of a global
expansion of soft power with specific interests centered around economic
and long-term governance objectives.

Conclusions

**[China is a strategic competitor both globally and regionally, [but
Beijing is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[not a peer]{.underline}**]{.mark}
or even near peer **[[in an Arctic context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To
suggest that China enjoys such status plays into Beijing's desired
narrative about its place as a near-Arctic state with rights and
interests throughout the region. Rather than casting China as this
regional peer competitor and fixating on China as a direct military
threat to Arctic state sovereignty or security, analysts should focus on
how Beijing's Arctic strategy reflects its global objectives**[. [China
does not have unlimited resources]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[and the
level of Beijing's direct [investment in the Arctic has been
overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[particularly when it comes to
northern infrastructure development]{.underline}**. Although **[few
Chinese projects have actually materialized]{.underline}**, Western
media and experts have inadvertently played into the narrative that
China is a key (and even essential) economic player across the Arctic,
relying on superficial information and media releases to reinforce
China's claims to relevance. Furthermore, China is certainly not a peer
to the United States or any other Arctic coastal state in the maritime
domain. Its scientific research icebreakers do not have the same
presence, impact, and capabilities as the Arctic state fleets, and its
knowledge of the region naturally lags those states' considerably---even
though China has effectively leveraged its reputation and limited
activities to "normalize" its regional presence.57

That stated, **[[commentators]{.mark} have a strong propensity to [focus
on]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[potential]{.underline}**]{.mark} Chinese
**[[investments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Sober
analysis]{.underline}**, however, **[reveals that the [Arctic states
have]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} blindly or
[**[naïvely accepted Chinese investments]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} recent **[[trends suggest a strong
sentiment against attempts by Chinese actors to
acquire]{.underline}]{.mark}** land or strategic
**[[infrastructure]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}**.34 A telling
example is Chinese real estate tycoon Huang Nubo's failed 2014 attempt
to buy a 218 km2 parcel of land near Longyearbyen on Svalbard,
ostensibly to build a resort for Chinese tourists. Likewise, Chinese
state-owned company General Nice Group's attempt to purchase a former
naval base in Greenland failed three years later. In 2020, state-owned
Shandong Gold Mining announced a deal to buy TMAC Resources and the Hope
Bay mining project in Nunavut, Canada. A Canadian review deemed it a
national security risk, culminating in a formal rejection in December
2020. These examples are illustrative of a **[wider trend of growing
caution among Arctic states and recognition of the security risks posed
by Chinese investment in resource development projects and
infrastructure]{.underline}**. However, displeased with these outcomes,
**[[Beijing has been unable to force China's way
in.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

As the circumpolar North steadily pushes away from China's win-win
narrative, Russia remains the one Arctic state still willing to embrace
it. Until 2014, Russia was wary of Beijing's self-described Arctic role,
particularly China's desired place in regional governance structures.35
In the wake of Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent
imposition of Western sanctions, Moscow turned to China for the
investment and markets needed to advance Russia's vital Arctic resource
projects. Moscow has had some success, most clearly the Yamal LNG
project, which is partially owned by China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC) (20 percent) and the Silk Road Fund (9.9 percent). Moscow has
also highlighted Russia's growing access to Chinese markets and capital
to counter the perception that Western sanctions have been successful in
damaging or isolating the Russian economy.

**[While [China's role in Russia's Arctic]{.mark} economy
has]{.underline}** certainly **[grown]{.underline}** since 2014, **[this
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[not representative]{.underline}** **[of a
broader]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[or systemic [Chinese
integration]{.mark} into the region]{.underline}**. **[Chinese
multinational oil companies are loath to run afoul of Western
sanctions]{.underline}**, **[and China's embrace of Russia has not
stopped those firms from discreetly pulling back from new
projects]{.underline}**. Despite Beijing's official position in
opposition to sanctions, the Chinese government seems to recognize the
difficulties that it can cause multinational companies. In March, the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reportedly summoned officials from
the three major energy companies (Sinopec, CNPC, and China National
Offshore Oil Corporation \[CNOOC\]) to review their business ties with
Russia and "urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian
assets."36

Relying on Chinese companies for Arctic development presents other
problems for Russia. While Chinese companies are still engaged in many
of these projects, those state-owned enterprises do not bring the same
capabilities as Western partners. From a technological point of view,
Russia cannot reliably substitute that lost cooperation with Chinese
equivalents. Russian experts have pointed to the partially Chinese-owned
Arctic LNG 2 (CNOOC 10 percent / Polar Silk Road 10 percent) project as
the most affected by the loss of Western engineering and technological
support. Professor Natalia Zubarevich of Moscow State University made it
clear that Russia should not count on China providing these critical
technologies.37

A transactional need to avoid conflict and advance resource projects
(for Russia) and shipping (for China) has driven Russia and China's
cooperative approach to Arctic investment and development. More broadly,
the Arctic is an area where the two powers can demonstrate a degree of
solidarity as part of their continuing economic and strategic conflict
with the United States and the West more broadly. Nevertheless, deep
differences remain---and are likely to become harder to disguise as
Chinese activity in the region increasingly intrudes in traditional
Russian spheres of interest. After all, China does not---and
cannot---accept Russian sovereignty and control over much of the
maritime space that Russia claims as internal waters.38 Connected to
this are questions of China's near-Arctic identity, its economic
development, and its shipping activity in the region, which challenge
Russian sovereignty and can be perceived as usurping Russia's role in
the Arctic as Moscow becomes increasingly tied to, and dependent upon,
China. **[[Russia will tolerate China as a partner, but not a peer, in
Arctic development]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The latter would erode
Moscow's strident attempts to legitimize Russia's perceived position as
the primary Arctic power]{.underline}**.39

#### CCP legitimacy [resilient]{.underline}.

on the Rocks*,
https://warontherocks.com/2021/02/chinas-post-covid-future-wuhan-wobbly/)

How Stable Is China?

Because **[[the CCP]{.mark} has [maintained]{.mark}]{.underline}**
itself in political [**[power for seven decades]{.underline}** **[and
weathered]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[multiple]{.mark} internal
[upheavals]{.mark} and external challenges]{.underline}**, many scholars
and analysts assume this will continue. Certainly, that **[the party
survived the worldwide crisis of communism in the late
1980s]{.underline}** and early 1990s is remarkable. Communist parties
fell from power across Eastern Europe in 1989 and the ruling Communist
Party of the Soviet Union could not prevent its own demise two years
later.

In the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, **[some predicted
the beginning of the end]{.underline}**. At the turn of the century, one
analyst wrote of The Coming Collapse of China. But the CCP has
demonstrated considerable resilience. More recently, a prominent U.S.
scholar caused a sensation when he penned a provocatively titled essay,
"The Coming Chinese Crackup." A year later, the same scholar clarified
that what he forecast was the gradual decline of CCP rule rather than
its imminent disintegration. Most recently, another respected scholar
forecast "China's coming upheaval."

**[The resilience of the ruling CCP and its ability to maintain power
are attributed to a combination of carrots and sticks]{.underline}**.
The foremost "carrot" is **[[China's booming
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which **[[has lifted hundreds of
millions out of poverty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[The party]{.mark}
also [gets]{.mark} popular [credit for]{.mark} maintaining [law and
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[which is partly driven by the public's
phobia of instability]{.underline}**. Moreover, under CCP rule, **[China
has grown in power]{.underline}** and stature **[on the world stage.
Chinese people take tremendous pride in the fact that [their country is
now considered a great power]{.mark}]{.underline}** and respected by
other countries. **[Credit]{.underline}** **[for China's rising hard and
soft power]{.underline}** **[goes to the CCP]{.underline}**.

**[[The CCP has assembled]{.mark} an impressive "stick": [a
muscular]{.mark}, multilayered, and technologically sophisticated
[coercive apparatus]{.mark}]{.underline}** or "digital
authoritarianism." **[Local public security bure]{.underline}**aus and
People's Armed Police **[are reinforced by closed-circuit television,
informants, and thugs for hire.]{.underline}** All of **[this is
backstopped by the]{.underline}** regular military, the People's
Liberation Army (**[PLA]{.underline}**). Moreover, **[the People's
Militia has been revitalized]{.underline}** in recent years **[and is
mobilized to deal with emergencies]{.underline}**, including social
unrest and natural disasters. **[[The CCP appears]{.mark} to be in a
[strong]{.mark} position]{.underline}**, **[[with an array of
instruments for social control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, it
**[[has deftly handled most challenges]{.mark} and threats in the reform
era.]{.underline}**

The greatest irony of the People's Republic --- as I have written
elsewhere --- is that what the ruling CCP fears most are the people of
China. The CCP is fearful that the people power opposition movements
which shook countries and toppled regimes around the world will inspire
Chinese crowds to take to the streets. The CCP is preoccupied with a
plethora of different groups --- disgruntled workers, irate farmers,
unhappy veterans, disaffected religious groups, and restive ethnic
minorities --- each of which has registered dissatisfaction through
physical demonstrations and online activism in recent years.

**[But the Chinese Communist Party's greatest challenge may not come
from [the people]{.mark}. While Chinese have numerous
complaints]{.underline}** about corruption, pollution, income
inequalities, and other issues, **[most [remain supportive of the
CCP]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### AT: CCP Collapse---1AR

#### No regime instability or collapse. 

**Huang 20**, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign
Relations. (Yanzhong Huang, 9-8-2020, \"America's Political Immune
System Is Overreacting to China\", *Foreign Policy*,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/08/america-overreacting-to-china-political-immune-system/)

Fallacy 2: It underestimates CCP Strength and Resilience

In identifying the CCP regime as the archrival of the United States,
Secretary **[Pompeo]{.underline}** makes a distinction between it and
the "dynamic, freedom-loving" Chinese people. His belief that CCP does
not represent the Chinese people might in part derived from his 1989
experience, where there was a genuine gap between Eastern European
people and the ruling communist parties. He **[fails to
recognize]{.underline}** **[the extremely strong support CCP receives
from the Chinese society]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[even after factoring
in the possibility that people may hide their actual
feelings]{.underline}** out of fear of government retribution, **[high
level of support of the regime in China was identified by various
opinion surveys]{.underline}**, **[including]{.underline}** a
**[Pew]{.underline}** Global **[Research]{.underline}** in 2014,
**[which found [92 percent of Chinese respondents had confidence in
Xi]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The disengagement thesis also unwittingly uses the Soviet empire to draw
an analogy with China. True, the CCP is "repeating some of the same
mistakes that the Soviet Union made," but **[[the resilience of
China]{.mark}'s authoritarian state [far surpasses]{.mark} that of
[the]{.mark} former [Soviet Union]{.mark}, which it has already
outlasted]{.underline}**. Economic historians remind us that even at its
peak, the Soviet economy produced considerably less than half of the
U.S. GDP. In 2019, however, **[China's GDP already amounted to
two-thirds of the size of the U.S. economy. [The GDP gap continues to
shrink in China's favor]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the second quarter of
this year, **[China registered an economic growth of 3.2 percent
compared to the same period a year ago.]{.underline}**

Furthermore, **[[Beijing has not lost its ability to respond to a
crisis]{.mark} by mobilizing resources]{.underline}** **[and
bureaucratic capacities for high priority]{.underline}**. **[The CCP's
commitment to ensuring its survival has been [clearly demonstrated
during]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19
pandemic. **[The outbreak caused the most severe]{.underline}**
social-political **[crisis]{.underline}** **[since]{.underline}** the
1989 **[Tiananmen]{.underline}** crackdown. **[Instead of allowing the
crisis to become China's]{.underline}** "**[Chernobyl
moment]{.underline}**," however, **[[the CCP turned to]{.mark} a
combination of traditional vehicles of the party-state and
high-[tech]{.mark} means]{.underline}** (e.g., big data and QR codes)
**[[to contain]{.mark} the spread of [the virus]{.mark}]{.underline}**
relatively **[quickly]{.underline}**.

By early April, **[it was clear that Xi had emerged as a winner in the
fight against the outbreak]{.underline}**. A series of national online
surveys of urban residents in China, conducted by the UCSD China Data
Lab, suggested that **[[the pandemic]{.mark} has [beefed up]{.mark}
government [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On a scale of 1 to 10,
**[the average level of social trust in the central government
increased]{.underline}** from 8.23 in June 2019 to 8.87 in May 2020. The
percentage of respondents who "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that they
prefer living under China's political system as compared to others
increased, too, from 70 percent in June 2019 to 83 percent in May 2020.

Xi might be a "true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology," as
Secretary Pompeo said, referring to Marxism, but **[the Party nowadays
increasingly relies on nationalism instead of communism alone as a
pillar of its legitimacy. The [failure of the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** effectively **[[handle the
outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and its "bullying" approach have
[pushed]{.mark} [nationalism]{.mark} and anti-Americanism [to an
all-time high]{.mark} in China]{.underline}**. Social media outlets in
the country are saturated with comments and posts that portray the
United States as a diminishing and hostile power. Social injustice,
political polarization, and policy paralysis are undermining the United
States' role as a beacon of democracy for China. According to the same
UCSD study, Chinese public's views toward the United States in May 2020
were significantly more negative than those in June 2019. **[[A large
percentage]{.mark} of the public, including those who are young and
educated, now dislike]{.underline}** **[and
[despise]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. **[[There is no]{.mark} natural
[constituency waiting to turn against the Party]{.mark} with the right
prompts.]{.underline}**

Don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting that the Chinese political
system is superior to Western liberal democracies. **[The Chinese
system]{.underline}**, like the Soviet one, **[is]{.underline}**
fundamentally **[flawed]{.underline}** and full of inherent
contradictions. But as former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates reminded
us, the system started to crumble only after Gorbachev took away the
fear and terror it depends on to survive. **[However, Xi is anybody but
Gorbachev,]{.underline}** **[and [there is no indication]{.mark} that
[the Chinese regime will collapse]{.mark} anytime soon]{.underline}**.
That is why we need to keep the competition peaceful and manageable. But
decoupling policy not only risks a new Cold War, but also increases the
chances of an actual war that results from an accidently sparked
conflict involving the two militaries. The United States may still win a
future cold (or even hot) war with China, but the cost would be way too
high to justify considering it a viable policy option.

#### Popular support is [ironclad]{.underline}.

affecting Hong Kong and the rest of China. A journalist for 25 years, he
has worked for various publications in Hong Kong and Toronto as a news

Most Americans think with its democracy, the United States has the best
form of government. China, with its one-party dictatorial state,
communist or otherwise, has the worst form. This is China's Achilles\'
heel and will spell the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
In reality, **[from [the Chinese]{.mark} people's
perspective]{.underline}** and theirs alone, **[their
[government]{.mark}]{.underline}** today [**[enjoys greater
legitimacy]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[popularity]{.underline}** **[than any American]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[or Western [government]{.mark}]{.underline}** with respect to their
own citizens. Consider the latest "Understanding CCP Resilience:
Surveying Chinese Public Opinion Through Time" produced by the Ash
Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy
School of Government. **[[Based on]{.mark} eight
[surveys]{.mark}]{.underline}** conducted between 2003 and 2016,
**[[and]{.mark} face-to-face [interviews]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[with
more than]{.underline}** **[31,000]{.underline}**
**[Chinese]{.underline}** urban and rural **[residents]{.underline}**,
**[the [satisfaction]{.mark} of the Chinese people with the central
government [was]{.mark}]{.underline}** as high as
**[[93]{.underline}]{.mark}**.1 **[[per cent]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
2016, and that of the other three-level governments -- provinces, cities
and counties -- was more than 70 per cent. By 2016, the Chinese
government as a whole was more popular than at any time in the previous
20 years. But by an almost universal (mis)understanding, the US
government represents the people and their interests while the Chinese
government doesn't. It's this unshakeable presupposition that leads many
outsiders to distinguish between the communist state and the Chinese
people. It turns on the all-important question of political legitimacy
and explains why top US officials nowadays don't refer to the Chinese
government but the Chinese Communist Party. It has become a common
rhetorical strategy for US President Donald Trump, Attorney General
William Barr, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and any number of Pentagon
generals and national security chiefs to draw a line between China's
leaders and its people. I would argue **[it's mainly because of this
unshakeable presupposition among many Westerners]{.underline}** -- and
Hong Kong people -- **[that so many analysts and pundits consistently
get China wrong]{.underline}**. **[Their doom-and-gloom prognosis has
been so consistent that people]{.underline}** who listen to them **[are
unfailingly surprised by how [China]{.mark}, instead of
collapsing]{.underline}**, **[[has achieved the greatest progress in
economic development]{.underline}]{.mark}** and human betterment
**[[in]{.mark} the shortest period of time in [history]{.mark} -- to
become the second-largest economy.]{.underline}** You are free to hate
and despise the Chinese state all you want, but **[[if you think it will
collapse]{.mark} by its own weight]{.underline}** **[[because it lacks
legitimacy]{.mark} or popular support, [you will always be
surprised]{.mark}]{.underline}** and never understand your enemy.

#### No [regime collapse]{.underline} or [instability]{.underline} -- this answers all their warrants

**Chen 15** (Dingding, Assistant Professor, Government and Public
Administration -- University of Macau, Non-Resident Fellow -- Global
Public Policy Institute, "Sorry, America: China Is NOT Going to
Collapse", 3/10,
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/sorry-america-china-not-going-collapse-12389?page=3)

In a recent piece published in the Wall Street Journal, The Coming
Chinese Crackup, China scholar and George Washington University
professor David [Shambaugh boldly predicts that the]{.underline}
Communist Party of China ([CCP)'s endgame has begun]{.underline}.
Although, [in the past, such brave [predictions of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the CCP's [[collapse]{.mark} [have **been proven
wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the fact that such a prediction has come
from Shambaugh, a leading China expert, makes it all the more
interesting. In a report from China's Foreign Affairs University,
Shambaugh was named the second most influential China expert in the
United States. As such, Chinese scholars and officials will take his
opinions seriously.

Professor [Shambaugh listed five indicators that point to]{.underline}
China's coming [collapse]{.underline}. However, [a closer
analysis]{.underline} of these five points [reveals that Shambaugh's
conclusion is based on incorrect facts and flawed interpretations
of]{.underline} China's [recent]{.underline} socioeconomic and political
[developments]{.underline}.

[First, he asserts that [wealthy]{.mark} Chinese are fleeing
China]{.underline}. Actually, [this is]{.underline} only [half
true]{.underline}. While a large number of wealthy Chinese have migrated
to countries like Canada, **[most]{.underline}** of them **[[still do
business in China]{.mark},]{.underline}** meaning that
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} are still [have a positive outlook on
China's future]{.underline}. In any case, [a good number]{.underline} of
these wealthy people [[move]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[assets]{.mark}
out of China [to avoid corruption]{.mark} charges, [which has **nothing
to do**]{.mark} [with]{.mark} China's future
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [in recent years an
increasing number of overseas [students]{.mark} have]{.underline} chosen
to **[[come back to China]{.underline}]{.mark}** because they have
confidence in China's future.

The [second]{.underline} indicator [is increasing]{.underline} political
[repression and CCP insecurity]{.underline}. Actually, not much has
changed in this area, compared to the Hu Jintao presidency. The party
insecurity thesis is an old argument and one can say that the CCP has
always been insecure, especially since 1989. So what is so special about
the present that signals the Party's endgame? Indeed, one can argue that
the Party's endgame is soon, no matter what it does. If the Party opens
up, then civil society will rise up and overthrow the regime; if the
Party continues to be repressive, it will breed insecurity, which will
cause its collapse.

[Third, Shambaugh argues that Chinese officials come across as wooden
and bored]{.underline}. But [many]{.underline} Chinese [officials were
always like that, so there is nothing new in this
observation]{.underline}. [It is **definitely not** something that can
support Shambaugh's "China collapsing" argument]{.underline}.

[Fourth, Shambaugh points out there is]{.underline} massive
[corruption]{.underline} in China. [Shambaugh]{.underline} is right
about the seriousness of the corruption issue in China. But he
[**neglects** to mention that the [anti-corruption]{.mark} campaign [has
been **very successful**]{.mark}]{.underline} so far, and the main
reason for this is **[because [it has the public\'s
support]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Corrupt officials know this too, which
is why they are unable to fight back.

[Shambaugh's final argument is that the]{.underline} Chinese [economy is
slowing]{.underline}. Arguably, this fifth factor is the only new point
in Shambaugh's argument, as the previous four factors have been features
of China's political culture for quite some time. As such, this argument
deserves serious consideration.

Shambaugh seems to believe that a slowing economy will lead to
widespread grievances, which in turn will lead to civil unrest. This
will lead to the collapse of the regime. Arguably, this is what fueled
the Arab Spring and may be applied to China today.

However, [there are several problems with this argument]{.underline}.

[First, China's]{.underline} economic [[slowdown is **not**]{.mark} **an
economic [meltdown]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is true that compared to
China's past sensational growth rate, a six to seven percent growth rate
is a slowdown. But which other major economy can grow at this rate?
[China's]{.underline} economic [[growth must be viewed]{.mark} in a
**[relative]{.mark} sense**]{.underline}.

Second, would a slowdown, or even a massive financial meltdown lead to
widespread disruption in Chinese society? The answer actually depends on
how the effects of the slowdown are distributed throughout society. As
Confucius pointed out long ago, Chinese people tend to get riled up more
about inequality than scarcity(患均不患寡), which is just as true today.
Most ordinary Chinese hate a high level of inequality, especially if
such inequality is a result of corruption rather than legitimate hard
work. [While a severe crisis would lead to a massive loss of jobs and
lower incomes, if the U.S. economy survived the 2008]{.underline} global
financial [crisis, [there is **no reason** to believe]{.mark} the
[Chinese economy cannot]{.mark} [overcome]{.mark} a similar
one]{.underline}.

Third, [even if a severe economic [crisis]{.mark} hits
China]{.underline} and causes greater social grievances, [why does this
mean]{.underline} that social [unrest will automatically lead to an
uprising]{.underline} against the regime? In other words,
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} claim [[is premised on the belief
that]{.mark} the Chinese government's [legitimacy relies **solely** on
economic performance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[Unfortunately [this]{.mark} assumption]{.underline}**, though widely
held among scholars, **[[is no longer true]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Economic growth is certainly important for most Chinese people, but
[[education]{.mark}, the [environment, corruption, and legal justice
matter **just as much** ]{.mark}**as growth**]{.underline}. [As long as
the Chinese government]{.underline} seriously [tackles]{.underline}
problems in [those areas, support for the CCP will **remain
high**]{.underline}. [This explains why]{.underline} the
[Xi]{.underline} administration has [initiated]{.underline} bold
[reforms in all these areas]{.underline}.

Finally, [even if there is]{.underline} political [unrest will it
necessarily topple the regime?]{.underline} [This depends
on]{.underline} the [balance of power]{.underline} between the
government and the dissenters. Where is the [political
opposition]{.underline} in China today? Does the political opposition
enjoy the [widespread support of ordinary]{.underline} Chinese
[people]{.underline}? Is there [any leader who might want to play the
role of Gorbachev]{.underline}? [**None of these factors** exist in
China]{.underline}.

In sum, [in order to make the argument that]{.underline} an economic
[slowdown would lead to regime change, one would have to make the
argument that all of the above]{.underline} factors would [come into
play]{.underline}. Yet, [Shambaugh's argument does not demonstrate
this]{.underline}. Indeed, [a slowing economy is actually
bringing]{.underline} several [benefits to China]{.underline}. A
[[slower]{.underline}]{.mark} but stable [[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}
rate would [[mean less pollution, fewer]{.mark} [land-grabbing]{.mark}
incidents, [less corruption]{.mark}, less [energy consumption, and
lower]{.mark}]{.underline} socioeconomic
[[expectations]{.underline}]{.mark}, all of [[which]{.mark} lead to
**[reduce]{.mark}d [social tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in China,
**[[decreasing the possibility of a regime
collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Implicit in Shambaugh\'s argument is the claim that China and the CCP
will collapse unless they adopt Western-style liberal democracy. But he
never attempts to answer a simple question: is Western-style liberal
democracy what most ordinary Chinese people want?

As Orville Schell and John Delury point out, wealth and power are the
two things that most Chinese people have pursued throughout the last
century. Today, with China's rising power and influence, international
respect can be added to this duo.

Do the Chinese also desire liberty, democracy, human rights, and so on?
Of course they do. My own research, which will be presented in a
forthcoming article based on survey data, shows that even among the most
liberal Chinese, the desire for liberty and democracy quickly weakens as
long as the Chinese government does a good job of tackling corruption,
environmental pollution, and inequality. Democracy is seen as a means,
rather than as an end.

Research done by late professor Shi Tianjian also shows that [Chinese
culture still favors authoritarianism even as people]{.underline} also
[desire democracy]{.underline}. Through this context, we can understand
that [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has become **so popular** among
the]{.underline} Chinese [masses because of his]{.underline} bold
[reform measures]{.underline}, which range from soccer-reform to
overhauling state-owned enterprises. Even in the area of political
reform, Xi is proceeding steadily as consultative democratic mechanisms
will soon be implemented at various governmental levels. Thus, it is no
exaggeration to say that Xi has been the most creative leader in the
last three decades. If anything, [the level of [support for the CCP is
**high**]{.mark}**er now** than]{.underline} it was in [the last
decade]{.underline}. [Ignoring this]{.underline} reality **[seriously
misreads Chinese politics]{.underline}** today.

Then, why do so many Western analysts not see this reality? What do
Shambaugh's article and similar writings reflect about the mentality of
some Western thinkers and analysts?

Perhaps implicit in such arguments is the collective worry or fear that
China will continue to become stronger, more prosperous, and more
assertive in international affairs. The West has not prepared for a
possibility where it is no longer the dominant force in the world. After
the Cold War, many Western democracies have adopted the triumphal "End
of History" thesis.

However, now that a strong and authoritarian China has emerged, one not
compliant with the standard "liberal democracy model" advocated by the
West, it is seen as a threat. The "China threat" narrative is
understandable, as people tend to fear something they do not understand
or that looks different. And China today is a great "other," but because
it is strong, it is more threatening than a weak "other." [A strong
China causes cognitive dissonance among many Western analysts because
according to their theories]{.underline}, an [authoritarian China should
be weak]{.underline}. [This explains the **selective reading** by
Western scholars]{.underline} of China's political reality.

Therefore, [Shambaugh's argument is **seriously flawed** due to its
problematic logic]{.underline}. However, this does not mean that there
is no merit at all in his piece.

For one, Shambaugh rightly reminds us that China's political system can
be quite unstable despite the appearance of stability on the surface and
efforts at reform. China's political system does need to be more open,
more inclusive, and more democratic; and it will someday. The ultimate
outcome of Xi's ongoing reforms remains to be seen. Nonetheless,
[**[all]{.mark} existing [indicators]{.mark}** [point to]{.mark} the
development of [a **stronger** and **more effective**]{.mark} system of
governance]{.underline} within China. [Instead of a quick
collapse]{.underline}, a mighty, confident, assertive, and authoritarian
[[China]{.mark} will be around for quite a while]{.underline}. As such,
discussion about China should take this reality into account, rather
than imagining the victory of the West's vision for China, however
uncomfortable this may be.

We cannot know Xi's priorities with certainty. Nevertheless, from what
we can observe, an elective **[[war against Taiwan is
hardly]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[compelling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
proposition **[for Xi]{.underline}**'s government.

**[Even with China's massive arsenal]{.underline}** of modern warships,
combat aircraft and missiles, **[[Beijing is nowhere near the]{.mark}
level of [superiority that would guarantee]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
**[[success]{.underline}]{.mark}**ful invasion **[given the probability
of US and Japanese]{.underline}** military **[resistance]{.underline}**.
**[[Xi would need to]{.mark} worry about]{.underline}** more than
**[[ferry]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** enough
**[[forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** and their supplies across the Strait
**[[through the gauntlet of]{.underline}]{.mark}** Taiwanese,
**[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[Japanese]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[ships]{.underline}**,
**[missiles]{.underline}**,
**[sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}**, **[[mines and
drones]{.mark}. A cross-Strait [war would disrupt]{.mark} regional
[economic activity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, threatening the livelihoods
of millions of Chinese. **[The [resulting]{.mark}]{.underline}** social
**[[turmoil could endanger Xi]{.mark}'s rule]{.underline}**.

**[[A]{.mark} Chinese [blockade]{.mark}]{.underline}** of Taiwan's ports
would be less risky, but **[would have disadvantages. Taiwan's
government may]{.underline}** choose to **[resist. Beijing's action
[would stimulate]{.mark} increased [anti-China
coop]{.mark}]{.underline}**eration around the world; **[China could
expect]{.underline}** to suffer **[sanctions]{.underline}** over a long
period. And **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[would have ample time to surge
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** into the region to assist Taiwan.

Beijing's attempts to intimidate the US government into abandoning
support for Taiwan have failed. **[Helping Taiwan to defend itself
remains bipartisan]{.underline}** US policy, even supported by
Republican Party politicians who want to stop arming Ukraine. Despite
the longstanding US policy of "strategic ambiguity", President Joe Biden
has publicly stated four times that US forces would intervene in
Taiwan's defence.

**[Xi doesn't necessarily need to solve the Taiwan problem during his
tenure to earn a legacy]{.underline}** in Chinese history. **[Xi has
three huge domestic projects]{.underline}**. The first is **[restoring
the primacy]{.underline}** and authority **[of the]{.underline}**
Communist **[Party]{.underline}**, **[which]{.underline}** prior to Xi's
tenure as general secretary **[had suffered a decline in prestige due
to]{.underline}** rampant **[corruption]{.underline}**, decentralised
governance and the empowerment of civil society. The
**[second]{.underline}** is what Xi sees as **[ideological
purification]{.underline}**, including cleansing China of "Western"
ideas and values. **[Third]{.underline}**, Xi must oversee **[the
transition of China's econ]{.underline}**omy from reliance on exports
and investment in infrastructure to a new model that can maintain robust
growth and advance China from a middle-income **[to]{.underline}** a
**[high-income]{.underline}** country. Success in **[these projects
would be enough]{.underline}** to secure **[glory for Xi]{.underline}**,
who already enjoys a section in the Party's constitution honouring "Xi
Jinping Thought."

**[A struggling econ]{.underline}**omy **[does not make Beijing more
likely to launch a war. China's [economic malaise]{.mark}]{.underline}**
appears to have **[[dampened]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Chinese public's
**[[enthusiasm]{.mark} for a Taiwan campaign. [The natural reaction
to]{.mark} a [lack of strength]{.mark} at home [is to be more
cautious]{.mark}]{.underline}** in foreign affairs, **[not more
aggressive]{.underline}**. Thus, **[the appearance of serious issues in
China's economy in 2023 led to Xi trying to lower
tensions]{.underline}** with the United States, and a direct appeal to
the business community to invest more in China during Xi's visit to
California last year.

Several US commentators and politicians raised alarm about Xi
purportedly "warning" Biden during the California summit that China
plans to forcibly seize Taiwan. A more accurate summary of Xi's remarks
would be that he restated the decades-old mantra that unification will
happen. He gave no timeline, he said he hoped it would occur by peaceful
means, and he denied that his government has a plan to attack Taiwan.

Like any People's Republic paramount leader, **[Xi must repeat the
promise of eventual unification]{.underline}**, build up a military
machine that deters independence, insist that the international
community adheres to the "one China" principle, and maintain pressure on
Taipei to enter negotiations with Beijing. **[There is no indication
that Xi's position in China is in jeopardy due to a perception he is not
tough enough toward Taiwan]{.underline}**.

**[Xi needs merely to avoid Taiwan declaring]{.underline}** formal
**[independence]{.underline}**. If Taiwan did do so, Xi would probably
opt for war. But **[even Taiwanese governments controlled by
the]{.underline}** **[D]{.underline}**emocratic
**[P]{.underline}**rogressive **[P]{.underline}**arty, which rejects the
idea of Taiwan being part of China, **[have shown that they will not
cross this line.]{.underline}**

**[[Xi reached the pinnacle]{.mark} of the Party hierarchy
[through]{.mark} a career of [careful positioning]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and quiet ruthlessness, **[[not]{.mark} by taking [grand
gambles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Since then, [he has shown a
preference for grey-zone tactics]{.mark}. There is no]{.underline}**

in the Taiwanese Strait,\" Georgetown Public Policy Review,
https://gppreview.com/2024/03/27/the-us-is-overestimating-the-likelihood-of-war-in-the-taiwanese-strait/)

The recent Taiwanese elections have reignited international political
discourse on the possibility of war in the Taiwan Strait. Given the
historical complexities of Taiwan-China relations and the role they play
in U.S. foreign policy, **[many U.S.]{.underline}** foreign policy
(USFP) **[experts are [predicting]{.mark} imminent
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the region. However, **[this [is
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** significant **[[miscalculation of Beijing's
appetite for war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. USFP officials commonly
misinterpret Chinese domestic politics and dynamics, especially
concerning Taiwan. Furthermore, almost two years after the outbreak of
war in Ukraine, USFP commentators still falsely draw parallels between
Ukraine and Taiwan and underestimate the power of Taiwan's "Silicon
Shield."

**[[Xi's rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Taiwan
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategic **[[political
posturing]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Chinese President Xi Jinping's stated intention to reunite Taiwan with
China is closely tied to his desire to consolidate power over the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Early in his tenure, Xi has strategically
cultivated support within the CCP to dismantle presidential term limits,
diverging from Deng Xiaoping's tradition of orderly and
institutionalized power transitions. In his address during the CCP's
centenary ceremony, he affirmed his policy of pursuing peaceful national
reunification but did not reveal the timeline for doing so. This
omission implies that **[Xi's discourse serves]{.underline}** primarily
**[as a mechanism [to solidify]{.mark} internal CCP
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rather than as a definitive roadmap for
action. Bang Xiao, a reporter and analyst on Chinese affairs, postulates
that showing ambition to take Taiwan will "cement Xi's place as a
remarkable person in China's history" -- indicating how his ambitious
messaging on Taiwanese reunification is a political power play. **[The
possibility of reunifying Taiwan and China is an emotive
issue]{.underline}** for Chinese citizens. **[Xi's rhetoric is pandering
to these emotions to appeal to his citizens and engender support within
the CCP, [without]{.mark} clearly signaling [a commitment to
actualize]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[reunification]{.underline}]{.mark}** of China and Taiwan.

Furthermore, Beijing recognises that **[[invading]{.mark} Taiwan [would
result in]{.mark} international [isolation and]{.mark}
condemnation]{.underline}**, **[including]{.underline}** but not limited
to **[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and embargoes from Western
nations. **[This could reverse Beijing's efforts to expand
power]{.underline}** and influence, and dampen Xi's global ambitions.
Economic [**[interdependence is China's key
vulnerability]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[[since]{.mark} the
[CCP]{.mark}'s [legitimacy rests on]{.mark} its]{.underline}** ability
to **[maintain]{.underline}** social, political and **[[economic
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** within China and its trade and economic
stability rests on the global market.

China and Taiwan do not mirror Russia and Ukraine

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine a year ago has
led many USFP commentators to draw a comparison to China's approach
toward Taiwan; however, Russia's direct military aggression contrasts
with China's blend of diplomatic pressure and military preparedness.
Although the war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that the threat of
cross-border conflicts is omnipresent, Taiwan and Ukraine differ
geopolitically, historically and strategically. The only real parallel
is that both countries are exposed to a large, aggressive authoritarian
neighbor. Taiwan is separated from China by the 180 km long Taiwan
Strait, compared to the long land border between Russia and Ukraine.
**[[An invasion]{.mark} by China [would be logistically]{.mark} more
[arduous]{.mark} than Russia's invasion into Ukraine and would require a
large number of ships]{.underline}** heavily **[laden with equipment,
which would be vulnerable to attacks]{.underline}**. **[[The slow
pace]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** these **[[vessels would expose
them to]{.underline}]{.mark}** long-range **[[missile
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, submarine assaults, and other forms of
advanced weaponry. Harlan Ullman, a senior advisor at the Atlantic
Council, emphasizes that to counter Taiwan's potential 45,000 defense
force, **[China would need to mobilize over 1.2 million
soldiers]{.underline}** from its active military personnel, which
exceeds 2 million. However, **[[the Chinese Navy possesses]{.mark} only
[a fraction of the necessary artillery]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
facilitate an invasion of that magnitude.

In addition, due to the historical association between Taiwan and the
U.S., as enshrined in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the **[U.S. is the
island's primary security partner. This heightens the global
consequences]{.underline}** of conflict between China and Taiwan, to a
far greater extent than the war in Ukraine. Regardless of China's
increasing military assertiveness, **[the U.S.' de facto
alliance]{.underline}** with Taiwan **[acts as]{.underline}**
"diplomatic **[deterrence]{.underline}**" against China. The Center for
Strategic International Studies' military experts even predict total
destruction of an invading Chinese militia by a U.S.-led coalition
before any occupation of Taiwan could occur.

Contrary to what might be inferred from Moscow and Beijing's
announcement of a no-limits partnership, the two states also follow
different strategies to advance their interests.
**[China's]{.underline}** strategic **[priority of peaceful
unification]{.underline}** with Taiwan **[follows the dream of a
one-China principle, and Chinese rhetoric stresses the maintenance of a
peaceful environment]{.underline}** while pursuing its historical
mission of territorial expansion. In line with this, China has
emphasized soft economic inducements as much as hard diplomatic and
military pressure. By contrast, Russia's invasion of Ukraine was an
aggressive attempt to secure its "near abroad" and counter NATO's
expansion -- an aim driven by Moscow's perception of a swiftly
deteriorating strategic environment. This fostered a sense of urgency
and hardened Moscow's appetite for war.

Taiwan's "Silicon Shield"

Many USFP commentators predict that China will invade
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** to assume control of
it**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** cutting-edge microchip and
**[[semiconductor industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, this
industry, home to 92% of the world's most advanced production of
semiconductors, **[[acts as a]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[[Silicon
Shield]{.underline}]{.mark}**" against the possibility of an invasion as
global economic dependence on this technology magnifies the importance
of peace and stability. **[China imports 40% of the global supply of
semiconductors and,]{.underline}** even though it invests heavily in its
domestic capability, **[relies on Taiwanese production to prop up
its]{.underline}** booming \$228.30 billion **[electronics
industry]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, **[China mines 72% of the world's silicon]{.underline}**,
an integral component for semiconductors, which illustrates the
interdependence of China and Taiwan's **[economies. [Beijing is]{.mark}
highly [strategic and understands]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[even
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** Chinese naval **[[blockade would]{.mark}
severely restrict trade]{.underline}**, exacerbating global economic
tensions, causing dramatic supply-chain disruptions and
**[[lead]{.mark}ing [to trillion dollar losses]{.mark} in economic
output]{.underline}**. **[[At worst,]{.mark} military [conflict
would]{.mark}]{.underline}** risk **[[destroy]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
**[[Taiwan's]{.mark} semiconductor [industry]{.mark} and]{.underline}**
seriously **[harm China's own econ]{.underline}**omy.

While USFP commentators should not underestimate the potential for
Chinese military expansion, they should also understand the nuances in
Beijing's posture towards Taiwan. A false interpretation of Chinese
domestic politics could result in inaccurate comparisons between
Russia-Ukraine and China-Taiwan that could, in turn, provoke USFP
actions that overstep China's red line.

The global climate leadership landscape has been in flux, particularly
ever since US President Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
announced the withdrawal of his country from the Paris agreement yet
again. The shift **[[left a leadership vacuum that many
expect]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed **[[China to
fill]{.underline}]{.mark}**, given its significant investments in
renewable energy and its ambitious net zero goal.
**[However]{.underline}**, recent developments, including China's missed
emission targets in 2024, suggest that **[[China may not]{.mark} yet [be
ready to]{.mark} [assume]{.mark} the mantle of global [climate
leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Difficult balancing act: economy and environmental commitments

**[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** climate **[[strategy has been
characterised by ambitious pledges]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as
achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and peaking carbon emissions before
2030. These commitments are supported by substantial investments in
renewable energy technologies, positioning China as a leader in the
global green transition effort. However, **[the reality of [meeting
these targets has proven challenging]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In 2024, China's carbon intensity, a measurement of carbon emissions per
unit of gross domestic product (GDP), fell by only 3.4%, missing the
official target of 3.9%. **[China is]{.underline}** also **[behind its
five-year goal of slashing carbon intensity]{.underline}** by 18%
between 2020 and 2025.

**[This shortfall underscores the difficulties China faces in balancing
its economic growth with its environmental commitments.]{.underline}**
As China's GDP is decelerating, the government needs to cut emissions
more aggressively to achieve the carbon intensity target set previously.

In recent years, the **[[reliance on industrial
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** to recover from the economic repercussions
of the Covid-19 pandemic [**[has led to increased energy
demand]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**,]{.mark} consequently,
**[[higher emissions]{.mark} in China. [This]{.mark}]{.underline}**
situation **[[is compounded by domestic coal consumption, which remains
a significant barrier to its climate leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**
aspirations.

**[Despite pledges]{.underline}** to halt overseas coal projects,
**[domestic coal burning still accounts for more than half of China's
energy consumption]{.underline}** and two-thirds of its electricity
output. **[This [reliance on coal poses a challenge to China's ability
to]{.mark} drastically [reduce emissions]{.mark} and transition to
cleaner energy sources]{.underline}**.

As the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement fundamentally

**[[There is a stark dichotomy between]{.mark} applause for
[Beijing's]{.mark}]{.underline}** climate [**[rhetoric]{.underline}**
**[and the reality]{.underline}** **[of China's
emissions]{.underline}**]{.mark} trajectory. Since
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, it
**[[has accounted for 90 percent of all global growth in]{.mark} carbon
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[China now produces more than 30
percent of the world's carbon]{.underline}** dioxide **[from fossil
fuels]{.underline}**. China's greenhouse gas emissions are more than
twice the United States' and more than four times India's or the
European Union's.

**[Five years have passed]{.underline}** since Chinese President
**[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping**['s]{.underline}** landmark **[pledge to
achieve net-zero]{.underline}** carbon **[emissions]{.underline}** by
2060, but **[[there is little evidence to suggest]{.mark} that [the
country's energy system]{.mark} and policies [are moving in the right
direction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[China will]{.underline}]{.mark}**
very likely **[[miss its 2025 carbon-intensity
pledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**---an 18 percent reduction in carbon
emissions per unit of economic output compared to 2020 levels---along
with all of its other 2025 pledges related to limiting coal use and
expanding clean power. And far from making good on a widely celebrated
2021 promise to phase out international financing of coal projects,
[**[China remains]{.underline}**, **[by far]{.underline}**, **[the
leading financier of]{.underline}**]{.mark} overseas
**[[coal]{.underline}]{.mark}** power capacity. At home, Chinese
planners started construction of 94.5 gigawatts of coal power generation
in 2024 alone, roughly equal to the power generated by the entire U.S.
nuclear power sector.

China's emissions trajectory illustrates the limitations of the most
venerated global climate pledge of all: limiting warming to 1.5 degrees
Celsius (or about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels by
the end of the century. **[[Even if China's carbon]{.mark} [emissions
peaked this year]{.mark} and]{.underline}** then
**[plummeted]{.underline}** linearly **[to zero by 2060]{.underline}**,
**[[China alone would consume the entire world's remaining carbon
budget]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a 66 percent chance of achieving the
1.5 degree goal.

#### It consumes more coal than the rest of the world combined

https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/20/china-climate-emissions-renewable-energy-solar-coal-trump/)
wtk

But none of these numbers can change the bigger picture. Since 2011,
**[[China has consistently consumed more coal]{.mark} [than the rest of
the world combined]{.mark}]{.underline}**; last year, coal use likely
hit another record high. **[[China's clean electricity]{.mark} additions
may be impressive, but they are [only now beginning to match growth
in]{.mark} overall [energy]{.mark} demand]{.underline}**, **[[which
means that fossil fuel energy consumption is]{.underline}]{.mark}**---at
best---only **[[plateauing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[without]{.mark}
any of it]{.underline}** yet **[[being displaced]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Meanwhile, an uptick in curtailed and otherwise wasted renewable
generation suggests that a further build-out of renewables is
increasingly constrained by grid infrastructure and market
inflexibility.

**[China's vast industrial sector]{.underline}**---often glossed over in
climate discussions---**[accounts for]{.underline}** around 60 percent
to **[70 percent of]{.underline}** the country's
**[emissions]{.underline}**. Industry currently depends on fossil fuels
to smelt ores, fire up furnaces, and serve as the feedstock from which
various products are made. The Chinese aluminum sector alone produces
roughly as much carbon dioxide as the entire country of Indonesia.
China's chemical, steel, metal, and minerals industries together exceed
the total emissions of the entire United States. Next to such figures,
the strident demands by various activists and advocacy groups for
climate commitments from sub-Saharan African nations with negligible
emissions appear even more absurd.

Some of [**[China's policies]{.underline}**,
**[including]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[its [lack of ambition to
electrify heavy industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**, actually **[[hold back
global decarbonization efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Cleaner means of
producing steel, nickel, graphite, or ubiquitous chemicals such as
calcium carbide and sodium hydroxide face fierce competition from highly
polluting but low-cost Chinese producers that enjoy generous government
support.

China has proposed and imposed export controls on key technologies
required to manufacture solar panels, batteries, and other clean
technology. Beijing may be keen to sell electric cars and solar
equipment at home and abroad, but it is clearly not giving these
technologies to the world.

If anything, **[[the Chinese example does not buoy hopes that a
developing country can both build a heavy industrial base and mitigate
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Meanwhile, activists and international
policymakers have expressed concern over the entanglement of China's
solar, battery, and electric car industries with state-sponsored forced
labor programs in the province of Xinjiang. Such objectionable policies
have now forced many governments and firms into difficult quandaries
over the ethical sourcing of solar panels and other clean technology.

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective Altruism,
https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/)

But I will bite. I think Halstead is quite convincing in arguing that
the paleoclimate **[[data does not give]{.underline}]{.mark}** us good
**[[reason to expect climate change to bring
about]{.underline}]{.mark}** irreversible **[existential
[catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}** any time soon,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** probably **[[gives]{.mark} us [good
reason to expect]{.mark} that [it won't.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The first thing to note is that **[the earth has been much
hotter]{.underline}** in the past **[than even the most dire warming
projections]{.underline}** predict it will soon become. **[[During
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
(**[[PETM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) 55 million years ago, **[[the earth
was]{.underline}]{.mark}** an astounding
14-**[[17°]{.underline}]{.mark}**C **[[above]{.mark} the pre-industrial
average, but species extinctions were limited]{.underline}**. Here is
Halstead:

Overall, in the PETM, temperatures were upwards of 17°C higher than
pre-industrial levels and **[the only species that went
extinct]{.underline}** that we know of **[was]{.underline}** a
**[single-celled]{.underline}** marine organism, and **[on land it was a
time of ecological flourishing]{.underline}**, persistence and
diversity.

But if the scorching temperatures of the PETM did not lead to
existential catastrophe, **[why believe that lower levels of warming
will now destroy humanity]{.underline}**? We saw in Part 2 that even Ord
seems concerned by this thought:

The best argument against ... unknown mechanisms \[for extinction\] is
probably that **[[the PETM]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[Paleocene--Eocene
Thermal Maximum\] **[[did not lead to a mass extinction, despite
temp]{.underline}]{.mark}**erature**[[s rapidly
rising]{.underline}]{.mark}** about 5 degrees Celsius, **[to
reach]{.underline}** a level of **[14 degrees]{.underline}** Celsius
above pre-industrial temperatures.

Toby Ord, The precipice

However, Ord suggests that even though the PETM was hotter than the 21st
century will be, warming during the PETM was slower than the rapid
warming we are now experiencing:

Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred times
faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.

Toby Ord, The precipice

Fair enough. But Halstead has something to say about that too.

Citing Willis and MacDonald (2011), Halstead reminds us that **[[we have
seen rapid warming before]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

a\. **[In Greenland]{.underline}**, **[temperatures]{.underline}** may
**[have risen]{.underline}** by **[10°]{.underline}**C, though this may
be an error in climate proxies.

b\. **[In [the Swiss Alps]{.mark}]{.underline}** and other parts of
Europe, a **[warming of]{.underline}** 2 to **[5°]{.underline}**C
**[appears to have occurred in 200 years or less]{.underline}**.

c\. **[In the [Sierra Nevada]{.mark}]{.underline}** of California,
**[rates of warming in the late glacial may have been]{.underline}** 4
to **[5°]{.underline}**C every 500 years **[around 15,000 years
ago.]{.underline}**

d\. At the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, **[there were
increases of 5°C and more over a few decades]{.underline}** (11,700
years ago).

e\. **[Data from [Greenland ice cores]{.mark}
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline}** that a \>**[[10°]{.mark}C
[warming]{.mark} may have [occurred over]{.mark}]{.underline}** 20 to
**[[6 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

f\. In California, warming at the close of the Younger Dryas (13,000
years ago) may have been on the order of 3°C in less than 100 to 200
years.

g\. For the entire Southwest US, a general warming of 4°C may have
occurred in less than a century (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

Halstead, Climate change and longtermism

Just as **[[history gives us abundant ev]{.underline}]{.mark}**idence
**[[of]{.mark} large mammals [surviving temperatures
hotter]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[than]{.mark} the earth is projected to
be]{.underline}** by 2100, **[history also gives us evidence of survival
at rates of warming comparable to the [worst-case scenarios]{.mark} in
the IPCC report]{.underline}**.

**[Even the worst-looking scenarios give cause for
comfort]{.underline}**. For example, **[[in]{.mark} the beginning of
[the Holocene]{.mark}]{.underline}** (\~10,000 BCE), climate change did
seem to play a role in the extinction of megafauna (large animals). But
there is little evidence of plant extinctions, and many megafauna
survived. In particular, Halstead notes, **[[humans]{.mark} lived,
and]{.underline}** by all appearances **[[thrived]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[during this time]{.underline}**. And as for the megafauna who
perished, a live scientific hypothesis is the overkill hypothesis: they
died because we killed and ate them. (Halstead assigns this 90%
credence, but notes that many scientists may be closer to 50%). All of
this gives us every reason for confidence that **[[today's humans,
with]{.mark} greater numbers, [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology,
**[[and forewarning]{.underline}]{.mark}** than our ancestors, **[[can
survive]{.mark} ongoing climate catastrophe.]{.underline}**

We saw in Part 2 that the only sustained argument which Ord makes in
favor of climate risk is his discussion of unknown mechanisms in the
context of paleoclimate. But, if Halstead is right to suggest that the
paleoclimate data gives us every reason for confidence in humanity's
survival, then we should not have much confidence in Ord's argument.

### AT: Warming---No Impact---1AR

#### The impact is [marginal]{.underline}, [slow]{.underline}, and [buffered]{.underline} by tech and infrastructure.

Institute; BA @ UC Berkeley. (Ted, Winter 2024, "Did Exxon Make It Rain

Discussions of weather-related natural disasters in recent years have
largely focused on one particular human factor: the consequences of an
anthropogenically warming planet. But the heavy concentration of
catastrophic disasters prior to the period when climate change began to
significantly warm the planet should remind us that the **[earth's
climate has always been highly variable, extreme, and
dangerous]{.underline}**. What determines whether hurricanes, floods,
heat waves, and wildfires amount to natural disasters or minor
nuisances, though, is mostly not the relative intensity or frequency of
the natural hazard but rather how many people are in harm's way and how
well protected they are against the climate's extremes.

**[[Infrastructure]{.mark}, institutions, [and
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology **[[mediate the relationship
between]{.underline}]{.mark}** extreme **[[climate and
weather]{.underline}]{.mark}** phenomena, **[and the
costs]{.underline}** that human **[societies bear]{.underline}** as a
result of them. **[[A]{.mark}ir [c]{.mark}onditioning
[mitigates]{.mark}]{.underline}** suffering during **[[heat]{.mark}
waves]{.underline}**. **[[Dams]{.underline}]{.mark}**, reservoirs,
**[and [flood control]{.mark}]{.underline}** systems **[keep water from
inundating population centers]{.underline}** during intense rainstorms.
**[Building codes [and hardened infrastructure help]{.mark} the built
environment]{.underline}** **[[withstand]{.underline}]{.mark}**
hurricanes, tornadoes, and other **[[extreme
weather]{.underline}]{.mark}** events. Multi-day
**[forecasts]{.underline}**, **[[early warning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
systems, **[[and emergency response]{.underline}]{.mark}** capabilities
**[[allow people to anticipate]{.mark} climatic
[extremes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, prepare for them, **[[and
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** them.

The implications of this point will be counterintuitive for many. Yes,
there are many types of disasters, like **[hurricanes and
floods]{.underline}**, that **[are causing greater economic
costs]{.underline}** in many places than they used to. But this is
almost **[entirely]{.underline}** **[because]{.underline}** the
**[places]{.underline}** that are most exposed to weather disasters
**[have]{.underline}** far more people and far **[more wealth in harm's
way]{.underline}** than they used to. Even if there were no global
warming, in other words, **[these areas would be much more at risk
simply because they have much more to lose.]{.underline}**

Once you factor out how many more people and how much more economic
activity are in exposed areas, the economic costliness of weather
extremes in recent decades has generally been flat or declining, not
rising. The human costs, meanwhile, measured by deaths associated with
climate and weather extremes, have fallen dramatically over the last
century. (See Figure 1, facing page.) Improving infrastructure and
technology have made most people much more resilient to climate hazards
today, even in relatively poor regions and even as the climate has
warmed.

Still, there has been no shortage of tragedies associated with extreme
weather events in recent decades. But where they do occur, it is almost
entirely due to failures of institutions and infrastructure, not the
additional extremity of the weather event due to climate change. Two
under-engineered and long-neglected dams in the divided country of
Libya, racked for years by civil war, fail, sending a torrent of flood
water into a large city and killing thousands. While Lahaina, Hawaii, is
ablaze,

Maui authorities fail to send out an evacuation warning and close the
main road out of the city, as fire hydrants run dry amid years-long
fights over water supply, resulting in a hundred avoidable deaths.
Katrina, a strong but not exceptional hurricane, makes landfall over New
Orleans, a city that sits mostly below sea level with a large low-income
population living in the shadow of levees that haven't been properly
built or maintained, killing well over a thousand.

These disasters were human-caused. But the human causes that turned
these extreme events into terrible disasters were failures of
infrastructure and institutions. Climate change was not the decisive
factor.

One would be hard-pressed to glean this crucial distinction from media
outlets like the New York Times, the Associated Press, and CNN.
Seemingly every day, we are bombarded by news of yet another extreme
weather event that is attributed to climate change. And while there is
evidence that climate change is influencing some of these events, the
role it is playing in most of them has been reliably exaggerated.

The consequences of this misattribution are significant. The capture of
the media by a catastrophist climate narrative has directed public
attention away from straightforward measures that policymakers can take
to reduce our vulnerability to the climate's extremes. It has allowed
politicians, in the wake of climate-related disasters, to divert
attention from their own failures by pointing the finger at fossil fuel
companies. It has amplified the claims of an increasingly unhinged
climate movement that has consistently polarized public sentiment on the
issue and undermined practical efforts to reduce emissions and
transition the world toward cleaner energy. And it has left many people
gripped by a terror about the future that solves nothing and isn't
justified to begin with.

In the media, the environmental advocacy community, and much of the
academy, the basic mental model for how climate change will impact human
societies is typified by the famous poster for Al Gore's Oscar- and
Nobel-winning film, An Inconvenient Truth, showing a hurricane coming
out of a smokestack. In the popular imagination, human combustion of
fossil fuels warms the planet, leading to epic hurricanes, floods, heat
waves, droughts, and wildfires that devastate societies.

The first part of this notion is unquestionably true: the planet is
warming due to human activities, primarily carbon dioxide emissions. But
**[the second part, that a warming planet is the cause of]{.underline}**
the **[extreme weather]{.underline}** events we are experiencing today,
**[is vastly oversimplified]{.underline}** and exaggerated. Day to day,
week to week, season to season, and year to year, **[there is enormous
natural variability]{.underline}** at every level of the earth's
geography and topography, and **[in relation to]{.underline}** virtually
**[every climate]{.underline}**-related **[phenomenon]{.underline}**
that impacts human societies. The main source of climate variability in
the past, present, and future, in all places and with regard to
**[virtually all climatic phenomena]{.underline}**, **[is]{.underline}**
still **[overwhelmingly non-human]{.underline}**: **[all]{.underline}**
the **[random oscillations in climatic extremes]{.underline}** that
occur in a highly complex climate system across all those highly diverse
geographies and topographies.

Indeed, **[[natural variability is far greater]{.underline}]{.mark}**
across all temporal and geographic dimensions **[[than]{.mark}
even]{.underline}** quite **[[extreme scenarios]{.mark} for
anthropogenic climate change can begin to produce]{.underline}**. Large
human populations, for example, occupy capitals as cold as Ulaanbaatar,
Mongolia, with an annual mean temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, and as
hot as Khartoum, Sudan, with an annual mean temperature of 30. Even
equatorial regions, where temperatures are relatively stable, can range
from 21 to 31 degrees from season to season and 16 to 32 degrees from
night to day. Compare that to extreme projections of, at most, 4 or 5
degrees Celsius of average warming globally by the end of this century.

**[The idea]{.underline}**, then, so perfectly captured by the poster
for An Inconvenient Truth, that **[a few degrees of warming would result
in powerful hurricanes and]{.underline}** intense heat waves
**[materializing out of thin air was always implausible]{.underline}**.
We know that anthropogenic warming can increase rainfall and storm
surges from a hurricane, or make a heat wave hotter. But **[there is
little evidence that warming could create a major storm]{.underline}**,
flood, drought, **[or heat wave where otherwise none would have
occurred]{.underline}**, rather than making ones that would have
happened anyway somewhat worse.

**[[The]{.mark} main [effect]{.mark} that climate change has on extreme
weather and natural disasters]{.underline}**, in other words, **[[is at
the margins]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A heat wave in which daily high
temperatures over the course of, say, a week never dropped below 99
degrees Fahrenheit in the absence of climate change would instead never
drop below perhaps 102 or 103 degrees with the warming that the Earth
has experienced to date. **[[A rain event that dropped 10 inches]{.mark}
of rain]{.underline}** over 48 hours **[[instead produces
11]{.underline}]{.mark}** inches of rain because of climate change. And
so on.

These examples represent phenomena in which the effects of climate
change are most straightforward and direct. One or **[two or three
degrees C]{.underline}**elsius **[of increase in the average background
temperature results in extremes]{.underline}**, both warm and cold,
**[being one or two or three degrees warmer]{.underline}**, possibly a
bit more, possibly a bit less, depending on the event and location.
Similarly, a degree of warming results in the atmosphere holding about 7
percent more water vapor, which translates to about the same percentage
increase in rainfall.

In these cases, climate science theory and observations are well
aligned. Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme heat
events and decreased the frequency of extreme cold events. It has led to
global sea level rise and glacial melting. At the regional level, some
areas have also seen increases in phenomena like extreme precipitation
events that are very directly linked to warming global temperatures.

But **[for most climate and weather phenomena, the effects
are]{.underline}** much more **[complicated and don't always run in the
same direction]{.underline}**. Warmer surface and ocean temperatures,
for instance, produce more rain from hurricanes, because warmer air can
hold more water vapor. But **[[climate change can also create
countervailing factors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[such as]{.mark}
increases in [wind shear]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[which]{.mark} may
[make it harder for hurricanes to develop]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
persist, **[and decrease their frequency]{.underline}**.

Media accounts have been quick to tie hurricanes and other complex
phenomena to climate change. But **[there is little data to
suggest]{.underline}**, thus far, that **[these events have actually
gotten worse]{.underline}**. The share of tropical cyclones that are
Category 3 to 5, the strongest storms, has risen in recent decades. But
**[overall tropical [cyclone activity has
decreased]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (See Figure 2, below.) As a result,
the absolute number of major storms has remained fairly steady over
time.

The situation is similar with other complex weather phenomena. Globally,
**[the area burned by]{.underline}** wild**[fires has
decreased]{.underline}**. **[[There has been no]{.mark} detectable
global [trend in]{.mark}]{.underline}** river **[[floods nor]{.mark}
for]{.underline}** the total land area flooded. There is likewise no
detectable trend globally in meteorological
**[[drought]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Regionally, the trends
vary]{.underline}**, with some parts of the world seeing increases in
phenomena such as flooding, wildfire, and rainfall, and others seeing
decreases. The area burned by wildfire in the Western United States, for
instance, has increased. But climate change is just one contributing
factor, alongside the long-term increase in fuel loads in U.S. forests
due to a century of fire suppression and the fact that there are a lot
more people living in forested areas to start fires.

Many extreme weather events will continue to intensify, or become more
frequent, absent rapid cuts in global emissions, as the climate
continues to warm. But like today, **[the effects will continue to be on
the margins of natural variability]{.underline}**. IPCC projections
suggest that the 1 extra inch of rain that global warming now adds to a
once-in-fifty years 10-inch rainstorm will instead be 3 or 4 extra
inches if we hit 3 degrees of warming. High temperatures in a heat wave
that today hit 42 degrees Celsius might hit 45 or 46 degrees with 3
degrees of warming. Global warming--induced sea level rise of, on
average, 9 to 10 inches globally over the last 150 years might rise
another foot or two by 2100.

There is also concern about so-called "tipping points"---the possibility
that some processes could result in a step change in the way that
warming affects the climate. Some scientists have proposed, for
instance, that climate change might result in a slowing down of the
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the system of ocean
currents through which the Gulf Stream brings warm water to the North
Atlantic and moderates temperatures across much of Europe. Others
suggest that the thawing of permafrost, and of methane hydrates on the
seafloor, could result in rapid release of methane and accelerate
warming, or that ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could
disintegrate rapidly, leading sea levels to rise much faster than most
current estimates suggest.

But while it is clear that continuing warming risks triggering these and
other potential tipping points, those that function at global scales and
have the potential to significantly impact the global climate do not
appear to be particularly abrupt phenomena that would bring major and
immediate global impacts. **[When scientists speak of things like
"rapid" release of methane or melting of ice sheets, they generally mean
rapid in geological time]{.underline}**. **[These processes would unfold
over centuries or millennia, not decades.]{.underline}**

We don't precisely know, moreover, how much additional warming would be
necessary to trigger many of these tipping points. **[Nor do we even
know if the feedbacks will all run in the same direction, toward a
hotter planet]{.underline}**. One recent review of the literature,
"Mechanisms and Impacts of Earth System Tipping Elements," concluded
that **[a cascading series of tipping points and climate feedbacks,
taken together, might in the worst case increase warming by half a
degree]{.underline}** Celsius by 2300. Some of these changes would be
irreversible. Thawing methane from the sea floor would never be restored
and major ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica would take
hundreds of thousands of years to recover if they were lost. But
**[there is little basis for claims that surpassing these tipping points
risks triggering irreversible, runaway warming]{.underline}**, as many
people have long feared.

Rather, **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the rest of this
century **[will make the world marginally hotter]{.underline}** almost
everywhere. It will make some weather events such as extreme rainfall
more intense than they otherwise would be. And it will result in some
other extremes being more frequent or intense in some parts of the world
and less so in others. **[But it [will not shift the basic function of
the Earth]{.mark} system [into]{.mark} a profoundly different
state]{.underline}**, **[[one]{.mark} that [human]{.mark}
societie[s]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline}** entirely **[[unfamiliar
with]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[or create]{.mark} weather
[extremes]{.mark} far [outside]{.mark} [the range]{.mark} of extremes
that human [societies have dealt with]{.mark}]{.underline}** in various
geographies that they have long inhabited.

4\. Tipping points

Climate tipping points, from Lenton et al. (2019)

As the world warms, we will begin to approach tipping points,
large-scale climate discontinuities that could lead to major increases
in total warming (Lenton et al. 2019). **[Could tipping points put us
on]{.underline}** an irreversible **[course towards existential
catastrophe]{.underline}** by 2100?

The first thing to say is that, as with the paleoclimate, tipping points
need to be contextualized within our understanding of specific
mechanisms, such as sea level rise, heat stress and crop failure, by
which climate change could lead to existential catastrophe. We have seen
that **[[even the most outlandish warming scenarios do not pose
a]{.mark} credible [threat of existential
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}** through any of these mechanisms. So
even if tipping points raise the probability of extreme warming, it
**[is not clear that they provide a new and credible pathway towards
existential catastrophe.]{.underline}**

More to the point, Halstead reviews each of the proposed tipping points
in the diagram above and argues in detail that none of these tipping
points presents a credible threat of human extinction. I will review a
few representative examples below. (Interested readers are invited to
consult Chapter 8 of the Halstead report).

Begin with dieback of the Amazon rainforest in the tropics and boreal
forests near the arctic. Both forests play an important role in trapping
carbon, preventing it from reaching the atmosphere.

Halstead suggests (plausibly) that boreal forest **[[dieback
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely to be something of **[[a
wash]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the world warms, the southernmost
reaches of boreal forests will become too warm to support existing
forests. But at the same time, boreal **[[forests will expand
north]{.mark}wards]{.underline}** into land that was previously too cold
to support them. For this reason, boreal forest dieback is not expected
to pose a significant existential threat anytime soon.

Amazon rainforest dieback is a bit more concerning. Indeed, Halstead
suggests, there is a good chance that human-caused deforestation will
continue to devastate the Amazon rainforest alongside the destruction
caused by climate change. However, Halstead reminds us, most
**[[tropical forests fluorished during the Eocene]{.mark} period, in
which periods were]{.underline}** more than **[[10°]{.mark}C
[hotter]{.mark}]{.underline}** than they are today. So there is no ready
inference from present-day warming to a catastrophic collapse of the
Amazon rainforest.

As Halstead reminds us, the IPCC's latest assessment report estimates
that even on pessimistic warming scenarios (4°C warming combined with
some pessimistic modeling assumptions), Amazon **[dieback is expected to
contribute about]{.underline}** 0**[.3]{.underline}**°C of additional
warming. A catastrophe? Yes. But **[an existential catastrophe?
Certainly not]{.underline}**.

**[What about]{.underline}** arctic **[permafrost]{.underline}**? A
great deal of carbon is currently trapped in the arctic permafrost, and
as the world warms, permafrost will gradually melt, releasing carbon
into the atmosphere. At Halstead reminds us, **[the IPCC]{.underline}**
currently **[projects]{.underline}** that each 1°C of warming will lead
to 18 gigatons of carbon (GtC) released from arctic
**[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** roughly **[[two percent of the
amount]{.underline}]{.mark}** projected **[[to be released by
2100]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a middle-of-the-road scenario (RCP 4.5)
by the IPCC. As before, this is a regrettable catastrophe, but hardly an
existential threat.

What about the most speculative scenarios? A rather controversial paper
by Will Steffen and colleagues, "Trajectories of the earth system in the
Anthropocene" predicts that once we reach 2°C of warming, the world will
enter a \`Hothouse Earth' phase, in which even with little additional
use of fossil fuels, cumulative warming will reach 6°C above
preindustrial levels.

Hothouse earth, Steffen et al. (2018)

At the risk of beating a very dead horse, the first thing to say about
**[[this]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}** is that it **[[still would not
kill]{.mark} us]{.underline}**. We have reviewed almost every plausible
direct mechanism (heat stress, crop failure, sea level rise, ...) by
which warming could lead to existential catastrophe. And we have seen
that none of these mechanisms plausibly threatens anything like
existential catastrophe even under the extreme assumption of 6°C
warming.

More to the point, **[\`[Hothouse Earth' is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
rather **[[speculative]{.mark} science]{.underline}**, **[and media
coverage has stretched its conclusions]{.underline}** far beyond those
initial speculations. The model itself is highly uncertain and presents
options for avoiding catastrophe. Here is Richard Bettes, Professor of
Climate Impacts at the University of Exeter:

With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the essay
presents the scenario as definite and imminent. The impression is given
that 2°C is a definite "point of no return", and that beyond that the
"hothouse" scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the
caveats that the 2°C threshold is extremely uncertain, and that even if
it were correct, the **[[extreme conditions would not occur for]{.mark}
centuries or [millennia]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

And what exactly is the research-backed case behind \`Hothouse Earth'?
Here things get a bit hairy, because as Betts reminds us, Steffen et al.
(2018) is an opinion piece, not a standalone research paper, and as such
it really doesn't do the kind of modeling that would be needed to
advance its thesis to the realm of serious credibility.

One thing that strikes me about the scientific literature on "tipping
points" is that there are a lot of review papers like this that end up
citing the same studies and each other ... There is a great deal of
interesting, insightful research going on using theoretical methods and
calculations with large approximations. However, we have yet to see an
equivalent level of research in the highly-complex Earth System Models
which generate the kind of detailed climate projections used for
addressing policy-relevant questions by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). Steffen and colleagues have made a good start at
addressing such questions, going as far as they can on the basis of the
existing literature, but their essay should motivate new research to
help narrow down the huge uncertainties. This will help us see better
whether "Hothouse Earth" is our destiny, or mere speculation.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

At the risk of piling on, Halstead adds another objection to the mix --
Steffen and colleagues seem to have forgotten to argue for the main
conclusion of their paper: that climate feedbacks could generate six
degrees of warming. Halstead collects together
**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the **[[feedback]{.mark}

### LIO Turn---2AC

**U.S. leadership is key to prevent an [authoritarian]{.underline},
China-led order.**

The **[[competition between the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**, the dominant power, and the EU on one
side **[[and China]{.mark} and Russia, challenging authoritarian
powers]{.underline}**, on the other side **[[is not merely]{.mark} a
conflict in terms of]{.underline}** geopolitical **[[hard
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** and materials, but **[[it is also about
contesting for beliefs and political values]{.mark}. [China has amped up
its economic, military, and technological advances]{.mark} [with the
intent to undermine the U.S.-led existing order]{.mark} [and]{.mark} to
[create a new China-led international order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
this purpose, China is looking to rebuild partnerships across the world,
particularly in the Global South. While China's influence has been on
the rise among these states, its ties in Europe have been deteriorating
primarily due to China's coercive economic and diplomatic policies, but
also Beijing's indirect support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The
EU, on its part, has started to reinforce cooperation with like-minded
partners, equipping itself with defensive tools designed to help
identify threats and articulate common responses. In this context, the
**[[growth in transatlantic ties]{.mark} could be [crucial to rebuilding
an effecti]{.mark}ve, representative [l]{.mark}iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder]{.underline}** that is relevant in
the new era, but equally important is the broader cooperation with small
and medium sized like-minded states and increased engagement in the
Global South [**[to offer alternatives to authoritarian values and
systems]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### LIO decline inflames hotspots and risks US-China and US-Russia war -- only maintaining hegemony can keep peace.

​The **[stability of the international system has long been closely
related to the stability of the key regions of Eurasia: [Europe]{.mark},
the [Middle East]{.mark} and [East Asia. War]{.mark} or the threat of
war [pervades all three]{.mark} areas at once.]{.underline}**

This makes a final feature of our era more sobering: a **[still
powerful,]{.underline}** but less reliable, **[[America]{.mark}. US
[advantages]{.mark}, economic and military, remain [substantial]{.mark},
and American [commitment]{.mark} remains [indispensable]{.mark} to a
decent world]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, at a time when many Western
countries face political paralysis, instability, or some mixture of the
two, America's own internal dramas could be uniquely damaging.

Yes, the near-term danger is a second Trump presidency that could weaken
US alliances and spur frontline states like Poland or South Korea to
build their own nuclear weapons --- or, alternatively, a second Biden
presidency in which America is led by a visibly declining
commander-in-chief. But the problems run deeper.

Lurking behind Trump is a larger America First movement that would just
as soon leave the world to itself. Lurking behind Biden is a potentially
potent form of progressive neo-isolationism. The political foundations
of American internationalism are thus unstable. Rising polarization and
domestic tensions could leave the US distracted, even consumed by its
inner demons --- just as surging global volatility makes the price of
that distraction higher.

World War III?

Eras of turmoil can bring happy endings. The Cold War birthed the
liberal international order, which eventually delivered more freedom,
peace and prosperity than humanity had ever enjoyed before. Today,
realism need not be synonymous with despondency, because **[the [US
and]{.mark} its democratic [allies]{.mark} still [have]{.mark}
[long-term advantages]{.mark} over their foes, including their free
governmental institutions.]{.underline}** But for political leaders and
business leaders, navigating this age of fragmentation will require
keeping some core principles in mind.

First, **[there is no return to "normal." Today's [crises in
Ukraine]{.mark}, the [Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark} and other
[hotspots]{.mark}]{.underline}** aren't freak occurrences. They are
**[[symptoms of]{.mark} deep, ongoing [shifts]{.mark} that are changing
the basic rhythms of global affairs.]{.underline}**

Particular crises may come and go; particular tensions may rise or fall.
But leaders in government and business must prepare for an era of
persistent vitality, competition and conflict. **[[Levels of
risk]{.mark}, both strategic and economic, will be [elevated]{.mark} for
years to come.]{.underline}**

Second, you can't have it all. After the Cold War, the US and its allies
could enjoy a world that was phenomenally congenial to their interests
and values at a very low price. Multinationals could exploit the
efficiencies globalization offered without worrying too much about the
vicissitudes of global politics. Neither approach is sustainable today.

As the leaders who attended this month's NATO summit can attest, the
cost of national security, and of safeguarding democratic values, is
rising as autocratic powers make their moves. Meanwhile, Western
companies that had to choose whether to stay in Russia after it invaded
Ukraine --- or are wondering how to protect their assets, operations and
reputations if China invades Taiwan --- are discovering that the
dilemmas of operating in a hothouse environment can be severe.

Third, **[[take worst-case]{.mark} scenarios
[seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Responsible American officials
need to [consider]{.mark} not just the possibility of a [US-Russia clash
or]{.mark} a [US-China conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- as
cataclysmic as either would be --- **[but also a [global
war,]{.mark}]{.underline}** in which **[conflicts in multiple theaters
erupt at once.]{.underline}** International corporations also need to
grapple with scenarios that would have seemed outlandish not so long
ago.

**[What if the security of vital sea lanes suffers because the Houthis
have set a precedent that others follow? How might their operations be
affected by a Sino-American war that causes a decoupling more
violent]{.underline}**, precipitous and far-reaching than nearly anyone
envisions today? We can hope these situations won't come to pass. But
grappling with them is how one builds the resilience, whether military
or intellectual, needed to thrive in a tumultuous world.

Fourth, as geopolitics and geoeconomics become inseparable, the West
needs to invest in new knowledge. In government, national security is no
longer so thoroughly dominated by diplomats and defense nerds.
Understanding investment patterns, financial and technological choke
points, and private sector decision-making has become crucial to
prevailing in modern rivalry. The private sector, for its part, is
entering a moment in which geopolitical illiteracy is simply negligent ,
given that few firms are wholly insulated from the disruption --- or
opportunity --- national rivalries can cause.

This relates to a final precept: Find the upside of adversity. Yes, the
world is getting nastier. But an age of **[[fracture creates chances
for]{.mark} the [US to build]{.mark} deeper
[connections]{.mark}]{.underline}** with like-minded nations in Europe
and the Indo-Pacific, **[to [catalyze]{.mark}]{.underline}** a historic
burst of **[[innovation]{.mark} in critical technologies]{.underline}**,
and to **[[demonstrate]{.mark} that [liberal societies]{.mark} can still
[outperform]{.mark} illiberal ones.]{.underline}**

It creates chances, as well, for firms to craft more resilient supply
chains; to reap the benefits of the new industrial policy; and to forge
stronger partnerships with a US government that desperately needs
private-sector creativity and innovation to master a new set of
economic, intelligence and military challenges.

We're in the opening phase of a brutally contentious era. The task is to
make the most of it.

**Defense is [wrong]{.underline}. The [convergence]{.underline} of

[furthers]{.underline} the necessity of [strong US
leadership]{.underline} to rebuke it.**

Dr. Hal **Brands 25**, PhD, Professor, Johns Hopkins University School
of Advanced International Studies. Senior Fellow, American Enterprise
Institute, 1-9-2025, \"The Looming Eurasian Menace,\" Washington Post,
01/09/2025,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/01/09/eurasia-iran-china-russia-north-korea-geopolitics/.

The **[most dangerous geopolitical phenomenon of our era
isn't]{.underline}** **[any single crisis]{.underline}**, conflict or
competitor. **[It is the]{.underline}** **[growing web of
ties]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** **[bind]{.underline}**
**[America's Eurasian foes]{.underline}**.

Eurasia --- the supercontinent encompassing Europe, Asia and their
outlying islands --- is the world's strategic center, where most of its
people and economic potential reside. An empire that ruled Eurasia could
project its influence across the adjoining oceans and around the world.

All the epic clashes of the 20th century --- World War I, World War II,
the Cold War --- were contests between autocracies seeking vast Eurasian
empires and the global coalitions that fought to turn them back. Today,
a **[new league of authoritarian leaders is]{.underline}**
**[reviving]{.underline}** **[this deadly pattern]{.underline}**.
**[[Revisionist]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- that is to say, violently
dissatisfied --- [**[powers]{.underline}** **[are locking
arms]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and thrusting the world into
the]{.underline}** **[next round]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** the
great Eurasian **[struggle that has shaped the modern
age]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, the United States is not ready for
the challenge.

The history of the modern era was foretold when it was just beginning.
In 1904, British scholar Halford Mackinder explained in a landmark
lecture how geography, technology and ideology were combining to ignite
an explosive Eurasian century.

He argued that the proliferation of railroads was shrinking Eurasia,
allowing ambitious states to shuttle huge armies across the landmass.
The end of the easy colonial expansion of the 19th century was turning
the great powers against one another in the 20th. Politics and
geopolitics were also interacting combustively: Tyrants now ruled modern
industrial economies, which would turbo-charge repression and conquest.

All these developments, Mackinder foresaw, would lead to titanic
battles. **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}** country or
**[[coalition]{.underline}]{.mark}** that mastered Eurasia [**[would
become a]{.underline}** **[global menace]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[for
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}** would [**[possess the power to make even
the]{.underline}** **[most distant]{.underline}** **[democracies
insecure]{.underline}**]{.mark}. So, **[aspiring]{.underline}**
conquerors would **[lunge]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** Eurasian
**[hegemony, while]{.underline}** offshore powers --- and the
**[vulnerable states]{.underline}** situated along Eurasia's edges ---
**[would fight to preserve their freedoms]{.underline}** by keeping the
supercontinent divided.

This was as good a guide as any to what followed. In World War I, a
militaristic, illiberal Germany sought to dominate Europe from the North
Sea to the Caucasus, creating a resource-rich empire and a springboard
to global power. It took a transoceanic coalition anchored by Britain
and the United States to beat the Germans back. In World War II, the
fascist powers racked up victories from the Atlantic coast of France to
the Central Pacific. An even grander coalition --- the United States,
Britain, the Soviet Union, China --- was required to rescue humanity
from a new dark age. During the Cold War, a communist bloc led by Moscow
dominated the heart of Eurasia and sought to press outward against a
free world led by Washington.

These contests claimed tens of millions of lives, showing how aggression
and atrocity could radiate outward from conquered continents. They also
demonstrated that the cycle of Eurasian conflict could be broken only by
the United States.

This distant superpower helped defeat two wartime bids for Eurasian
hegemony. During the Cold War, it preserved a favorable balance within
the supercontinent by erecting the alliances --- NATO and several
security pacts in the Western Pacific --- that secured its economically
dynamic flanks. These partnerships enabled democracy to thrive and the
free-world economy to flourish, and they formed the foundation upon
which the liberal world order was built. By the 1990s, the Western
victory over the Soviet Union had inaugurated a post-Cold War era of
great-power peace and democratic dominance. But dreams of autocratic
empire are now reviving, and a second Eurasian century has begun.

In Northeast Asia, North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is building up his
nuclear and missile arsenals in hopes of driving America from the Korean
Peninsula. In the Middle East, Iran and its proxies are fighting the
United States and Israel over the region's future. In Europe, Russian
President Vladimir Putin is waging a quasi-genocidal war to rebuild the
Russian empire --- with an assist from North Korean troops. China is
racing to prepare for war with Washington and making its push for
primacy in the Western Pacific.

**[Each of [these countries aim]{.mark}s [to]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[overturn the existing order]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[in]{.underline}** **[key regions]{.underline}** **[around
the]{.underline}** Eurasian **[periphery]{.underline}**. Each
[**[sees]{.underline}** **[U.S.]{.underline}**]{.mark} power and
[**[liberal values]{.underline}** **[as its greatest
foes]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And **[what makes the]{.underline}**
**[current moment]{.underline}** **[so]{.underline}**
**[precarious]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** that **[these
aggressive powers are making common cause]{.underline}**.

[**[China]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[Russia]{.underline}**
**[announced their]{.underline}** **["no limits"]{.underline}**
**[strategic partnership]{.underline}**]{.mark} just before Moscow
launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. They mean, in Chinese
President Xi Jinping's words, to revolutionize the international system
by causing "changes the likes of which we haven't seen for 100 years."
Since that invasion, [**[Russia]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth [**[Ko]{.underline}**r]{.mark}ea have
[**[sealed a formal military alliance]{.underline}**;
**[Russia]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark} have **[[built a stronger defense
partnership]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which technology, weapons and
know-how flow both ways. And since Oct. 7, 2023, Russia has provided
targeting data and other assistance to the Houthis in Yemen, who have
also acquired missiles and other means of mayhem from Tehran. Most of
**[these [relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}** aren't new, but all
**[have]{.underline}** [**[grown rapidly]{.underline}** **[in
the]{.underline}** **[hothouse global environment]{.underline}**
**[created by wars]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in]{.underline}**
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** **[and the]{.underline}**
**[Mid]{.underline}**dle **[East]{.underline}**.

To be sure, there is no overarching multilateral alliance --- no
autocrats' NATO. Mistrust among the illiberal powers remains pervasive.
But [**[their relationships constitute a]{.underline}** **[cohering
network of ties]{.underline}** **[among states that are determined
to]{.underline}** **[wreck]{.underline}** **[Pax
Americana]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and command]{.underline}** some of
**[the most valuable strategic real estate on Earth]{.underline}**.
Western **[observers]{.underline}** **[play down]{.underline}** **[the
autocrats' pacts at their peril, because some of history's greatest
cataclysms have been caused by]{.underline}** **[dysfunctional ---
yet]{.underline}** profoundly **[destructive]{.underline}** ---
**[alliances]{.underline}**.

Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan never could have
coexisted in the long run. But before World War II, their cooperation
delivered devastating multiplier effects by destabilizing governments on
several fronts at once. During the early Cold War, a wary alliance
between Moscow and Beijing intensified the threats facing the free
world. And whether the new autocratic pacts are love matches or
marriages of convenience, they are having serious strategic effects.

For one thing, these relationships encourage aggression by reducing its
costs: A heavily sanctioned Russia has been able to continue its war in
Ukraine thanks to the missiles, artillery shells, drones and troops it
has received from Tehran and Pyongyang, and the economic succor it has
gotten from Beijing. Likewise, the pacts increase the danger of war on
some fronts by pacifying others: Putin can go all-out against Ukraine
because he faces no threat from China, just as Xi can be bolder in the
Pacific because he has a friendly Russia at his back. An autocratic
peace within Eurasia encourages violent meddling around its margins.

Autocratic relationships also weaken Western pressure on individual
regimes: Russia now shields Pyongyang from sanctions, while Tehran and
Moscow develop illicit trade networks beyond U.S. reach. These
relationships divide U.S. attention by creating trouble in several
places at once. Witness Washington's agonizing debates over aid for
Ukraine vs. support for Taiwan, over hammering the Houthis vs.
husbanding missiles for a war with China. Perhaps most fundamentally,
autocratic ties are shifting the military balance.

Beijing's record-breaking buildup has long involved purchases of Russian
planes, missiles and air defenses. And Sino-Russian defense cooperation
is only getting deeper and more secretive as the two countries work
together to build submarines, helicopters and other key capabilities.

Across Eurasia, in fact, transnational production networks are emerging:
Iranian-origin drones are being built in Russian defense plants, where
North Korean workers reportedly labor. The autocratic arms trade is
burgeoning, as Russia promises to sell state-of-the-art aircraft, air
defenses and other advanced capabilities to its partners. Disruptive
military innovation is accelerating, as North Korea receives Russian
technology and know-how for its missile and satellite programs. These
countries' militaries are also learning from one another: Iran's missile
and drone attack against Israel in April looked suspiciously similar to
Russia's previous strikes against Ukraine.

**[If the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates once **[served as the]{.underline}** **[arsenal
of democracy]{.underline}**, **[a]{.underline}** modern-day **[[arsenal

**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[China]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea have already [**[managed]{.underline}**
**[more]{.underline}**]{.mark} defense-technological
**[[collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}** than the Axis powers of the
World War II era ever did. Even if they never come together in a
full-fledged military alliance, [**[they could]{.underline}** **[still
deepen]{.underline}**]{.mark} their
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in dangerous
ways]{.underline}**.

For example, they **[could collaborate [on]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[more sensitive]{.underline}** **[projects]{.underline}**: Russia
could **[support]{.underline}** North Korea's rapidly improving
[**[nuclear]{.underline}** **[program or]{.underline}**]{.mark} give
Beijing its most **[[advanced submarine]{.underline}]{.mark}**-quieting
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology. Putin could give the Houthis
anti-ship cruise missiles to make their attacks more lethal. Russia and
China could [**[swap insights on how to]{.underline}** **[use nuclear
threats]{.underline}**]{.mark} to keep the United States from
interfering **[as they]{.underline}** **[coerce]{.underline}**
**[or]{.underline}** **[attack]{.underline}** **[their
neighbors]{.underline}** --- precisely what Putin has done in Ukraine.
Or perhaps **[these countries could find]{.underline}** more **[dramatic
ways]{.underline}** **[to cooperate in crisis or
conflict]{.underline}**.

China and Russia are already conducting military drills in potential
conflict zones from the Baltic Sea to the Western Pacific, signaling
that one illiberal power won't sit on the sidelines as Washington fights
another. Russia could aid China in a future conflict against the United
States by conducting cyberattacks that make it harder for America to
mobilize. Or Putin could menace Europe by posturing his forces there
while the Pentagon is preoccupied with a crisis in Asia. If any of this
seems unlikely, just remember that Western observers have repeatedly
been surprised, even shocked, by how far these relationships have
already come.

Meanwhile, [**[closer ties among]{.underline}** **[U.S.
adversaries]{.underline}** **[raise]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [odds
that a war that starts in one place will]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[spill into others]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Recall that **[World War
II]{.underline}** **[began not as a]{.underline}**
**[global]{.underline}** **[conflict but as a set of]{.underline}**
**[regional crises]{.underline}** **[that gradually intensified and
became inseparable --- just as]{.underline}** the United States'
**[Eurasian crises are becoming]{.underline}**
**[sharper]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[more
interwoven]{.underline}**, **[today]{.underline}**.

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[is]{.underline}** still struggling **[to]{.underline}**
**[adapt]{.underline}** **[to this situation]{.underline}**. Washington
continues to see the world as being divided into separate regions. This
assumption is dangerously outdated.

As the Eurasian axis coheres, **[individual crises take
on]{.underline}** **[global]{.underline}** **[meaning]{.underline}**.
**[It might be fashionable to talk about]{.underline}** **[pivoting
away]{.underline}** from Europe to focus on China. **[But]{.underline}**
one reason it would be so damaging if America abandons Ukraine, and
Russia defeats it, is that **[this would be a]{.underline}**
**[victory]{.underline}** **[for the]{.underline}** larger **[autocratic
coalition]{.underline}** **[in its showdown with the democratic
world]{.underline}**.

#### China is the [largest threat]{.underline} to the LIO

**Crane and Brands 25**, \*journalist, \*\*Professor of Global Affairs
at the Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins University, and a
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. (\*Brent Crane,
interviewing \*\*Hal Brands, 3-11-2025, "Hal Brands on the Axis of
Autocracies" https://chinabooksreview.com/2025/03/11/hal-brands/) wtk

That brings us to **[the]{.underline}** so-called "axis of resistance"
or "**[axis of autocracies]{.underline}**." What is that?

Different people call this thing by different names. Basically what it
refers to **[is the thickening web of strategic ties among the states
that are most aggressively challenging the international
system]{.underline}**. These relationships date back decades in many
cases. But they have grown and they have flourished in the context of
the wars in Ukraine and, more recently, the Middle East. These **[[wars
have]{.mark} created a hothouse geopolitical environment. They have
[encouraged the Eurasian autocracies]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
**[China, Russia, Iran, North Korea]{.underline}** --- **[[to forge
closer ties]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[so that they can join together for
purposes of both self-protection and geopolitical
predation.]{.underline}** And while these relationships don't look like
America's alliances, they have a bunch of important strategic effects.
[**[They encourage]{.underline}** **[disruptive military
innovation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[They help Russia sustain its war
in Ukraine]{.underline}**. **[They reduce the isolation that aggressive
states would otherwise face]{.underline}**. So they have a variety of
effects, all of which are quite disruptive from the perspective of the
United States and its allies.

What role does China play in this axis?

**[[China]{.mark} is the most formidable of the Eurasian
autocracies]{.underline}**. **[It [poses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in my
view, **[[the greatest threat to the survival of the U.S.-led world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That's true certainly in East Asia, where
the Chinese military challenge is most severe. But **[it's true on a
global scale]{.underline}** as well. **[Look at how [China is trying to
make itself the international economic]{.mark} and technological
[heavyweight]{.mark} of the 21st century]{.underline}**. At the same
time, **[[China plays a key role in strengthening the other Eurasian
autocracies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even though a lot of attention has
rightly been paid to the fact that Iran and North Korea have contributed
weapons (and, in North Korea's case, troops) in support of Russia's war
in Ukraine, **[there's no way Putin could have sustained the war for so
long without his economic relationship with China]{.underline}**.
**[China has helped to rebuild Russia's defense industrial
base]{.underline}**. It has provided an outlet for Russian goods. It has
become increasingly intertwined with Russia economically, financially
and technologically. So **[China is, by itself, the most formidable of
the autocracies, and also the one that helps intensify the threats the
others pose.]{.underline}**

Yet, out of all of these states, China is the one we're most intertwined
with. Trade and peer-to-peer relationships with Chinese companies are
still pretty robust. What's the evidence that China wants to upend the
U.S.-led order from which it benefits so much?

Yes, China is the most intertwined with the existing world order and it
has the most to lose if that order is disrupted. After all, China is
still dependent on the global economy. It's still dependent on
technological inputs from the United States and other Western countries,
although it's trying to reduce that dependence urgently. China has also
not challenged the system as violently as Russia or Iran have in the
last couple of years.

But [**[if you look at China's aims, it's hard to reconcile them with
the international system as we know it]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[That's
true if you look just at China's territorial claims against its
neighbors]{.underline}**. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** Greater
**[[China that Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping **[[is trying to put
together includes Hong Kong]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** but it also includes about **[[90% of
the South China Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**; a chunk of
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** that's the size of a small European
country; **[[and a bunch of other revanchist aims]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in the Asian littoral and mainland.

There's also the fact that **[China is pretty clearly looking for an
exclusive sphere of influence in East Asia]{.underline}** --- "Asia for
Asians," as Xi Jinping called it about a decade ago. Not necessarily one
in which China physically dominates the region, but one in which its
preferences have to be obeyed and cannot be challenged. And one in which
the U.S. is essentially booted to the sidelines of the region.

On a global scale, **[[China]{.mark} also [seeks a very different
distribution of power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When Chinese officials or
propagandists talk about China's "great rejuvenation", they are
referring to a situation in which China is once again the most advanced,
most respected, most powerful country in the world as, in the Chinese
narrative, it was for many, many centuries prior to the onset of the
century of humiliation in the 1800s.

That doesn't mean that China is going to create a Sinocentric
international order that looks exactly like the American-led
international order. I'm sure it will be different in many respects. But
**[just listening to what Chinese leaders say, it's harder and harder to
deny that China seeks a world in which power balances have
changed]{.underline}**, **[and in which China has an increasing ability
to write the rules of the road in the 21st century]{.underline}** in the
way that the U.S. wrote them in the 20th.

Fellow at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney;

Council, 16 September 2021, "How China Exports Authoritarianism,"
*Foreign Affairs*,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-09-16/how-china-exports-authoritarianism.

**[Although some analysts]{.underline}** continue to **[argue that China
does not pose an ideological threat to prevailing democratic norms and
that the CCP does not export its ideology, it is clear that the [CCP has
embarked on a drive to promote its style of authoritarianism to
illiberal actors]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}**. Its goal is
not to spread Marxism or to undermine individual democracies but rather
to achieve political and economic preeminence, and its efforts to that
effect---spreading propaganda, expanding information operations,
consolidating economic influence, and meddling in foreign political
systems---are hollowing out democratic institutions and norms within and
between countries.

To respond to Beijing's ideological challenge, advocates of democracy
must have a better understanding of what China aims to achieve by
exporting its political model and how its actions are weakening
democracy globally. Only then can they effectively design policies that
will reinvigorate democracy at home and abroad while selectively seeking
to counter Beijing's promotion of authoritarian governance.

RIGHT TO BE RULED

**[[Beijing seeks]{.underline}]{.mark}** less to impose a
Marxist-Leninist ideology on foreign societies than **[[to]{.mark}
legitimate and [promote its own authoritarian
system]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The CCP does not seek ideological
conformity but rather power, security, and global influence for China
and for itself. To this end, the party has issued stark declarations of
confidence in its own ideology and in the country's antidemocratic
political path. **[Xi has made clear that he regards China's illiberal
model of governance as superior to so-called Western political systems
and that he seeks to popularize this "Chinese wisdom" throughout the
world as a "contribution to mankind."]{.underline}**

**[[Xi]{.mark} and other Chinese leaders [frequently portray China's
economic success as proof that the road to prosperity no longer runs
through liberal democracy]{.mark}. As Xi put it]{.underline}** at the
19th Party Congress **[in 2017, China's model offers "a new option for
other countries and nations who want to speed up their development
while]{.underline}** preserving their independence"---while **[ignoring
external pressure to democratize. [This]{.mark} message [is highly
attractive to leaders who hope to achieve economic success without
answering to the demands of their people]{.mark}. Chinese officials now
commonly speak of the "right" of nations to choose their political
systems, be they democratic or authoritarian]{.underline}**---**[and the
arrogance of countries such as the United States that assume that
democracy is]{.underline}** the **[preferable]{.underline}** option.

Advocating the right of countries to be ruled by nondemocratic regimes
is clearly different from forcibly installing autocratic leaders around
the world, as the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. But **[[the
CCP's]{.mark} increasingly [full-throated promotion of
authoritarianism]{.mark} as a superior governance model [presents no
less of a challenge to democracy than did Soviet
interference]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[particularly when paired with
China's economic and political measures that bolster authoritarian
regimes]{.underline}** and weaken democratic ones **[around the
world]{.underline}**.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE

**[[China's international efforts to subvert
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}** fall into three broad categories. The
first **[[includes its attempts to shape the narrative about China in
developed countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In nations ranging from
Canada and Germany to Australia and Japan, **[Beijing aims to silence
critics of China and amplify the voices of individuals and institutions
that promote closer ties with Beijing]{.underline}** or a more positive
portrayal of China. **[Beijing wields both threats and inducements to
this end, rewarding positive portrayals and punishing
criticism]{.underline}**. As the Chinese ambassador to Sweden admitted
in 2019, "We treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we
have shotguns."

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** offers preferential market access to
friendly governments, academic institutions, and businesses but
retaliates financially against those it sees as hostile to China's
interests. It also **[[threatens]{.mark} Chinese [dissidents]{.mark} and
their families, monitors Chinese students abroad, attempts to silence
academic discourse deemed offensive to Beijing, and seeks to control how
foreigners are educated about China]{.underline}**. **[Beijing has also
sought to expand its foreign media footprint, control Chinese-language
media abroad, and turn Chinese diaspora citizens against parties or
candidates it deems threatening to its interests]{.underline}**. Taken
together, **[these actions form a comprehensive strategy to inform,
shape, and ultimately control perceptions of China throughout
the]{.underline}** **[world]{.underline}**.

The second category of antidemocratic actions are those that take place
in developing countries. Unlike in the developed world, where China's
political and economic coercion and "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy have
engendered a growing backlash, Beijing has received a warmer welcome
**[in many developing countries]{.underline}**, where elites hope to
learn from a political system that has enabled China's transformation
into the world's second-largest economy. In a growing number of fragile
democracies, **[[Beijing has captured]{.mark} small coteries of [corrupt
elites]{.mark} and helped them centralize power by insulating them from
the demands of civil society and deploying Chinese technology to repress
their citizens and help them maintain power indefinitely. This is how
the CCP is exporting authoritarianism around the globe]{.underline}**:
not through seminars on Marxist ideology, as some analysts have claimed,
but through a broad range of antidemocratic activities.

**[China does so]{.underline}** less **[[out of a desire
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** spread its ideology than to **[[expand its
influence and economic advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Its favored
partners are not fervent adherents of Marxism-Leninism but rather
officials, business leaders, media tycoons, and others who view the
adoption of a nondemocratic governance model that concentrates power in
the hands of the few---and shuts out the many---as a route to long-term
influence. This **[preference for antidemocratic
collaborators]{.underline}**, coupled with China's opaque and corrupt
investment practices, further **[corrodes democratic
institutions]{.underline}**, as murky deals struck by Chinese banks and
state-owned enterprises encourage a more corrupt and unaccountable class
of political elites all too eager to undermine their country's long-term
prosperity in return for personal gain.

**[China offers more than simple inspiration for a nondemocratic
governance model]{.underline}**: it provides the tools, training, and
resources that permit leaders to ignore democratic countries' demands
for good governance and respect for individual rights as a condition of
aid and investment. The CCP regularly conducts large-scale training
programs for foreign officials on how to guide public opinion, control
civil society, and implement Chinese-style cybersecurity policies in
their home countries. A growing number of countries have drawn
inspiration from China to pursue laws controlling social media or to
build Internet firewalls modeled on China's own "Great Firewall."
**[[China]{.mark} also provides [increasingly]{.mark} [sophisticated
surveillance tech]{.mark}nology and [internal security training to
established authoritarian and fragile democratic
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}**, enabling them to better suppress
dissent and control their own citizens. **[In countries such as Uganda
and Zambia, CCP-linked organizations have shared technology and training
with autocratic and autocratic-leaning governments]{.underline}**,
allowing them to monitor their citizens, muzzle media and civil society,
and impose repressive Internet rules.

**[[The CCP has]{.mark} also [engaged in more explicit political
intervention by interfering directly in the political processes of other
sovereign countries]{.mark} to support China-friendly politicians and
policies and by co-opting local civic groups and journalists to stymie
negative portrayals of China]{.underline}**'s international engagement
and to protect its ties to corrupt local elites. These efforts are not
intended to overthrow democracies or other ideologically dissimilar
regimes but to help ensure that China-friendly policies and investment
climates will prevail regardless of who is in power. Nevertheless,
**[such efforts]{.underline}** erode the accountability of leaders to
their citizens, weaken the independence of the media and civil society,
and ultimately **[tilt the playing field to favor illiberal leaders
looking to import elements of China's model of governance into their
countries' political systems]{.underline}**. This kind of political
encroachment maintains the form of a democratic system while hollowing
out the actual substance of a functioning democracy from the inside,
making the slide toward authoritarianism harder to detect.

#### US leadership is the [greatest force for peace]{.underline}---extinction

The Long Peace Must be Protected

Let's be clear: [**[the US-led order has been the]{.underline}**
**[greatest force for peace]{.underline}**]{.mark} and human progress
**[in modern history. [The world has avoided a third world war that
could end life on earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Former enemies became
allies. **[Over a billion people rose out of extreme
poverty]{.underline}**. Colonial empires ended, and a new era of long
peace was maintained.

In the aftermath of World War II, **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[and]{.underline}** its
**[democratic allies [constructed a rules-based international order
unlike any prior global system.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[This Western-led order]{.underline}**, grounded in the basis of
collective security, open markets, the rule of law, and liberal values
-- **[has propelled an era of critical peace and
prosperity.]{.underline}**

The long peace enjoyed since the end of WWII, has been pillared on the
strength and efficacy of both the world systems and institutional
capacity created by the US and the West, and the values and deterrent
power and might of the US in both preventing and stopping wars.

**[For nearly eight decades, [no great-power war has engulfed the world,
a stark contrast to the first half of the 20th
century.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[This long peace has been largely underappreciated despite the fact
that we are living in the most peaceful period of modern
time]{.underline}**. [**[This stability is a]{.underline}** **[direct
dividend]{.underline}** **[of the Western-led international
orde]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[r]{.underline}** established after
1945,but **[[this is now at risk of being dismantled by the forces out
to undermine the current Western led order]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with
the persistent and strategic undermining of the US rules based order.

**[[Revisionist authoritarian powers seek to weaken]{.mark} the system
of alliances and [norms]{.mark} that has kept aggression in
check]{.underline}**. To understand how the US anchored order has
preserved peace, saved lives, and deterred conflict, it is important to
fist visualise how this order might be threatened by the current
bandwagon of the world in ignoring this status quo of stability on the
grounds of being smitten by the so called rise of the rest and the
perceived inevitable decline of the West.

Contrary to these models and assumptions, the primary power and
stability of the US and the West and their power supremacy have not ever
been under threat by any of the rising powers out to challenge this
primacy.

In all indicators of power, whether economic, military, technology,
resources, demographics, and future trends, **[the US retains a
significant power advantage]{.underline}**, and no other power will come
close to replacing this primacy in at least the next three decades.

However, **[[this rules-based order]{.mark} and the long peace [will be
threatened]{.mark} if the world conveniently ignores it and [if the US
is weakened]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For all its flaws,**[[the
Western-led order has been humanity's best safeguard against global
war]{.mark} and tyranny.]{.underline}**

It has defeated totalitarian threats from fascism to communism to
terror, protected the global commons and trade arteries, fostered
unprecedented economic growth, saved lives through medical and
technological inventions, prevented tyrannies and autocratic forces from
unchecked human rights abuses, and championed humanitarian values.

All these make the case that the American-led rules-based system has
been our time's most important global force for peace and security.

The Long Peace Dividend: Deterrence, Democracy, and Rule of Law

**[The most overlooked achievement]{.underline}** of this long peace and
Western order **[is the prevention of another catastrophic world
war]{.underline}**. Before 1945, great-power conflicts were common with
the likes of the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, World War II, and
countless earlier wars among empires.

World War II alone killed an estimated 70--85 million people (about 3%
of the world's population. The US-led initiatives to establish a new
world order based on democracy and institutional governance, with the
likes of the United Nations, NATO, and the Bretton Woods systems, helped
to prevent conflicts and to minimise damages.

**[US military strength and nuclear deterrence dissuade any would-be
aggressors from launching global war.]{.underline}**

In essence**[, a dominant democratic superpower acted as a stabiliser,
where]{.underline}** the **[hegemonic stability]{.underline}** theory
**[helped to keep peace and deter wars.]{.underline}**

Conflict-related deaths have fallen dramatically from mid-20th-century
levels, reflecting the long peace under the post-WWII international
order.

By the 21st century, war deaths worldwide had dropped to historically
low rates -- in most years, conflict killed fewer than 1 in 700 people
globally. The avoidance of another great-power war is the chief reason.
The Cold War ended without direct superpower combat. The post-1945
great-power stability has twice outlasted the interwar period and is the
longest period of stability among the great powers in centuries. **[[The
international order anchored by U.S.-led alliances, nuclear deterrence,
and democratic norms created a balance that made large-scale war
infeasible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Hence, the world has reaped the
reward in hundreds of millions of lives not lost to war.

**[Of parallel importance is the spread of democracy and the rule of
law, which has created more peaceful relations]{.underline}**:
**[[democracies rarely fight one another]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as
reflected in the democratic peace theory.

**[Countries that share the values of democracy and rule of
law]{.underline}** through institutions like the EU or U.S. alliances
have virtually **[eliminated the likelihood of conflict among
themselves]{.underline}**. Western Europe, once the ground zero for two
world wars, has seen 77 years without war between major states.

This has moved us away from the notion of might is right to a time when
independent and sovereign nations would respect each other's rights and
rules, but this has now come under increasing threat without the US led
prevailing power stabiliser if other powers continue to undermine this.

The Western liberal order won the 20th century, making democracy and
free markets the prevailing paradigm worldwide. Millions in Eastern
Europe were freed from dictatorship and the Cold War ended with the
expansion of freedom and democracy and a liberal economic order that has
seen the global economic progress today.

From fascism to communism to terrorism, the Western-led order has
preserved the lives and freedoms of billions of people -- those rescued
from tyrannies, and those never caught in wars that were avoided.

As John Kennedy once said, "A mankind that has managed to avoid war is
one that will find prosperity and progress." The Western order has
embodied that maxim. Defending free nations and deterring aggressors
ensured that the latter half of the 20th century was far less bloody
than the first. It is difficult to imagine any alternative system
achieving the same record.

America as Global Policeman: Securing the Seas and Skies

American military preeminence has formed the global security backbone
that all nations benefit from. On the high seas, the U.S. Navy has
ensured freedom of navigation and the safety of maritime commerce for
decades. The U.S. Navy's dominance of the world's oceans has made it as
an indispensable guarantor of global trade, as 90% of global trade by
volume travels by sea. Under Pax Americana those sea lanes have remained
largely open and peaceful. No other power comes even close in having
this capacity and might to ensure global peace and maritime order.

U.S. and allied naval forces patrol choke points like the Persian Gulf,
Strait of Hormuz, and Strait of Malacca to deter blockades or piracy.

This resulted in energy supplies and goods flowing relatively freely,
fueling the world economy. The US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain and Seventh
Fleet in the Pacific act as constant stabilising presence in critical
regions.

**[American-led security of the seas has been a true global public
good]{.underline}** -- one often taken for granted. The US naval
umbrella not only secures trade but also allows countries to forgo
building massive navies of their own, thereby reducing arms races.

The stability of shipping routes enables astonishing expansion of global
commerce, where exports as a share of world GDP quadrupled from about 5%
in 1945 to over 20% by the 2000s, reflecting how much more
interconnected the world economy became under a US protected trading
system.

China benefited from this new economic order and the stability and
security of the market system and the maritime route that are critical
for its export oriented economy.

Beyond the seas, the US continued to lead in policing global airspace
and outer space. The US Air Force's global reach deters rogue states
from threatening civilian aviation and American GPS satellites provide
navigation free-of-charge worldwide, but borne by American taxpayers.

Prosperity Through Stability: Unprecedented Global Development

The Western-led order created conditions for a surge in global
prosperity, lifting billions out of poverty and transforming the
economic landscape. In 1950, much of Europe and Asia were still in ruins
as a result of the wars and most of the world's population lived in
poverty. Today, the world economy is roughly \$100 trillion in size.
Global GDP per capita has tripled since 1945. Life expectancy worldwide
has jumped from about 45 years in 1950 to over 72 years now, owing to
better nutrition, healthcare, and technology diffusion. These gains were
not inevitable, but rather they were nurtured by the Western system's
open markets, financial aid, and technological leadership.

Beyond the Marshall Plan, institutions like the World Bank funded
infrastructure and industrial projects in developing nations.

The security provided by the US led peace allowed countries to spend
resources on development rather than defense. Europe could demilitarise
compared to its past. Japan, shielded by the US alliance, devoted itself
entirely to economic growth, with minimal military spending.

Both China and India, which remained poor through the Cold War, saw
spectacular economic rises in the 1990s to 2000s by integrating into the
US led international economy.

China's export-driven boom, lifting 800 million people out of poverty,
and this was facilitated by access to Western markets and adherence to
Western-devised rules of trade and investment.

The numbers of people living in extreme poverty worldwide dropped
substantially. In 1990, more than 1.9 billion people, or 36% of the
world's population, lived under the World Bank's extreme poverty line.
By 2019, that number had fallen to about 650 million or around 8% of the
population. Over 1 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty in one
generation, where the stability and openness of the post-Cold War
international order allowed capital and goods to reach more places,
creating jobs and raising incomes.

The **[Western-led international order has been the first to act in
cases of genocide, famine, or natural disaster, securing the sanctity of
life.]{.underline}** From the concept of responsibility to protect, to
providing non-military humanitarian leadership, the order has sustained
basic human principles and sanctity of life.

The New Threat: Autocratic Revisionism and the Erosion of Order

**[[This order is now under threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where the
global pivot toward anti-US will unravel the fabric of international law
and norms that have kept the peace. **[[From China's open defiance of
maritime law]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Asia **[[to]{.mark} the constant
[undermining]{.mark} of the global financial and American [security
support]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[these create the buy in for a
post-American order]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that new forces might lead
if the US is weakened]{.underline}**, but **[[the new order would be far
less stable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[less free, and potentially more
hazardous and risky for there is no precedent and no global experience
for any of these new powers in even experiencing any form of pervasive
global security and economic management, what more to lead the world in
revising the old rules.]{.underline}**

**[[Replacing rule-of-law principles with raw power politics will
endanger the world and push it back to the dangerous anarchic era of
might is right.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[The revisionist ideology will weaken the institutional
deterrence]{.underline}**, **[putting the world into a more dangerous
phase of non abidance and non adherence to the rules based
order]{.underline}**, where affiliation will be based on economic
entanglement and appeasement to the higher power based on the hard power
threats.

**[[The diminished role for international law will create spiralling
security dilemma, arms races and a free for all]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[where anarchy prevails]{.underline}** in a survival-of-the-strongest
era. **[The [constraints and deterrence on war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and abuse built up over 75 years, **[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}**
deteriorate and **[[erode quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[if this
revisionist momentum is not checked.]{.underline}**

The world would be entering a period of high risk, just like the
unstable decades before 1914 or 1939, but with far deadlier weapons in
play.

History serves painful lessons of what happens when global orders are
overturned by aggressive powers. The world sleepwalked from the Concert
of Europe into World War I; the failure of the League of Nations in the
1930s led to World War II.

Defending the Greatest Peace System in History

Defending the rules-based order does not mean resisting change or being
blindly rooted to the conventional systemic approach, but reforms and
changes can be made. Notwithstanding that, core facets must remain.

These include the notions that aggression is unacceptable, genocides and
human rights abuses will never be tolerated, that all nations are bound
by common laws, and that democracy and human dignity are worth
protecting.

The order can endure and adapt as long as these ideals remain at the
forefront of the Western alliance. If they are abandoned, we risk
descending into an era of darkness again.

**[For all its flaws, the current global order dominated by the single
Western power parity is still the best bet in preventing aggression,
saving lives, and inventing new progress for mankind.]{.underline}**

What would winning look like? China's communist rulers would give up
trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and
its friends. And the Chinese people---from ruling elites to everyday
citizens---would find inspiration to explore new models of development
and governance that don't rely on repression at home and compulsive
hostility abroad.

In addition to having greater clarity about its end goal, the United
States needs to accept that achieving it will require greater friction
in U.S.-Chinese relations. **[[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to
adopt rhetoric and [policies that]{.mark} may feel uncomfortably
confrontational but in fact are necessary to [reestablish
boundaries]{.mark} that Beijing and its acolytes are

Jinping for his policy of fostering global chaos. It means speaking with
candor about the ways China is hurting U.S. interests. It means rapidly
increasing U.S. defense capabilities to achieve unmistakable qualitative
advantages over Beijing. It means severing China's access to Western
technology and frustrating Xi's efforts to convert his country's wealth
into military power. And it means pursuing intensive diplomacy with
Beijing only from a position of American strength, as perceived by both
Washington and Beijing.

No country should relish waging another cold war. Yet a **[[cold war is

leaders. Rather than denying]{.mark} the existence of this [struggle,
Washington should own it]{.mark} and win it. [Lukewarm
statements]{.mark} that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely
[court]{.mark} a [hot war]{.mark}; they [signal complacency]{.mark} to
the American people and conciliation to Chinese leaders]{.underline}**.
Like the original Cold War, the new cold war will not be won through
half measures or timid rhetoric. Victory requires openly admitting that
**[a [totalitarian regime]{.mark} that [commits genocide, fuels
conflict]{.mark}, and [threatens war]{.mark} will never be a reliable
partner.]{.underline}** Like the discredited détente policies that
Washington adopted in the 1970s to deal with the Soviet Union, the
current approach will yield little cooperation from Chinese leaders
while fortifying their conviction that they can destabilize the world
with impunity.

BIDEN'S NEW BASELINE

The administration's China policy initially showed promise. President
Joe Biden maintained the tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed
on Chinese exports in response to the rampant theft of U.S. intellectual
property. He renewed, with some adjustments, the executive orders Trump
had issued to restrict investment in certain companies affiliated with
the Chinese military and to block the import of Chinese technologies
deemed a national security threat. In a particularly important step, in
October 2022, Biden significantly expanded the Trump administration's
controls on the export of high-end semiconductors and the equipment used
to make them, slowing Beijing's plans to dominate the manufacturing of
advanced microchips. Across Asia, Biden's diplomats pulled longtime
allies and newer partners closer together. They organized the first
summits of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, bringing
together the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States,
and convened high-profile trilateral summits with the leaders of Japan
and South Korea. Biden also unveiled AUKUS, a defense pact among
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

As it turned out, however, aggression would come from the opposite
direction, in Europe. Less than three weeks before invading Ukraine,
Russian President Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** had
**[[signed a]{.mark} "no limits" [security pact with Xi]{.mark} in
Beijing.]{.underline}** In a prudent step after the invasion, Biden drew
a redline by warning Xi in a video call that the U.S. government would
impose sweeping sanctions if China provided "material support" to
Moscow. **[[Xi]{.mark} nonetheless [found]{.mark} plenty of [ways to
support]{.mark} the [Russian war machine,]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[sending semiconductors, unarmed drones, gunpowder, and other wares.
China also supplied Moscow with badly needed money in exchange for major
shipments of Russian oil. Chinese officials]{.underline}**, according to
the U.S. State Department, **[even spent more money on pro-Russian
propaganda worldwide than Russia itself was spending.]{.underline}**

**[Beijing was also [coordinating]{.mark} more closely [with Iran and
No]{.mark}]{.underline}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea**[, even
[as those regimes sent]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} to help Moscow wage war
in Europe.]{.underline}** Yet Washington was pursuing siloed
policies---simultaneously resisting Russia, appeasing Iran, containing
North Korea, and pursuing a mix of rivalry and engagement with
China---that added up to something manifestly incoherent. Indeed, the
situation that Xi had forecast at the start of the Biden administration
was becoming a reality: "The most important characteristic of the world
is, in a word, 'chaos,' and this trend appears likely to continue," Xi
told a seminar of high-level Communist Party officials in January 2021.
Xi made clear that this was a useful development for China. "The times
and trends are on our side," he said, adding, "Overall, the
opportunities outweigh the challenges." By March 2023, Xi had revealed
that he saw himself not just as a beneficiary of worldwide turmoil but
also as one of its architects. "Right now, there are changes, the likes
of which we haven't seen for 100 years," he said to Putin on camera
while wrapping up a visit to the Kremlin. "And we are the ones driving
these changes together."

If ever the time was ripe to call out Beijing for fomenting chaos and to
start systematically imposing costs on the country in response, it was
early 2023. Biden, inexplicably, was doing the opposite. On February 1,
residents of Montana spotted a massive, white sphere drifting eastward.
The administration was already tracking the Chinese spy balloon but had
been planning to let it pass overhead without notifying the public.
Under political pressure, Biden ordered the balloon shot down once it
reached the Atlantic Ocean, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
postponed a scheduled trip to Beijing to protest the intrusion. Press
reports suggested the administration had kept quiet about the balloon in
order to gather intelligence about it. But a troubling pattern of
downplaying affronts by Beijing would persist in other contexts.

In June 2023, leaks to the press revealed that Beijing, in a remarkable
echo of the Cold War, was planning to build a joint military training
base in Cuba and had already developed a signals intelligence facility
there targeting the United States. After a National Security Council
spokesperson called reports about the spy facility inaccurate, a White
House official speaking anonymously to the press minimized them by
suggesting that Chinese spying from Cuba was "not a new development."
The administration also greeted with a shrug new evidence suggesting
that COVID-19 may have initially spread after it accidentally leaked
from a Chinese laboratory. If the virus, which has led to the deaths of
an estimated 27 million people worldwide, turns out to have been
artificially enhanced before it escaped, the revelation would mark a
turning point in human history on par with the advent of nuclear
weapons---a situation that already cries out for U.S. leadership to
govern dangerous biological research worldwide.

In the spring of 2023, as Beijing's actions grew bolder, Biden initiated
what the White House termed an "all hands on deck" diplomatic
campaign---not to impose costs on Beijing but to flatter it by
dispatching five cabinet-level U.S. officials to China from May to
August. Blinken's June meeting with Xi symbolized the dynamic. Whereas
Xi had sat amiably alongside the billionaire Bill Gates just days
earlier, the U.S. secretary of state was seated off to the side as Xi
held forth from the head of a table at the Great Hall of the People. For
the first time in years, Xi appeared to have successfully positioned the
United States as supplicant in the bilateral relationship.

What did the United States get in return for all this diplomacy? In the
Biden administration's tally, the benefits included a promise by Beijing
to resume military-to-military talks (which Beijing had unilaterally
suspended), a new dialogue on the responsible use of artificial
intelligence (technology that Beijing is already weaponizing against the
American people by spreading fake images and other propaganda on social
media), and tentative cooperation to stem the flood of precursor
chemicals fueling the fentanyl crisis in the United States (chemicals
that are supplied mainly by Chinese companies).

Any doubts that Xi saw the American posture as one of weakness were
dispelled after Hamas's October 7 massacre in Israel. Beijing exploited
the attack by serving up endless anti-Israeli and anti-American
propaganda through TikTok, whose algorithms are subject to control by
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese diplomats, like Russian ones,
met with Hamas's leaders and provided diplomatic cover for the terrorist
group, vetoing UN Security Council resolutions that would have condemned
Hamas. And there is little sign Beijing has done anything, despite
Washington's requests, to help rein in attacks carried out by the
Houthis on commercial vessels and U.S. warships in the Red Sea---attacks
conducted by the Yemeni rebel group using Iranian missiles, including
ones with technology pioneered by China. (Chinese ships, unsurprisingly,
are usually granted free passage through the kill zone.)

Whether Xi is acting opportunistically or according to a grand
design---or, almost certainly, both---it is clear he sees advantage in
stoking crises that he hopes will exhaust the United States and its
allies. In a sobering Oval Office address in mid-October, Biden seemed
to grasp the severity of the situation. "We're facing an inflection
point in history---one of those moments where the decisions we make
today are going to determine the future for decades to come," he said.
Yet bizarrely---indeed, provocatively---he made no mention of China, the
chief sponsor of the aggressors he did call out in the speech: Iran,
North Korea, and Russia. Through omission, Biden gave Beijing a pass.

THAT '70S SHOW

The current moment bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1970s. The Soviet
Union was undermining U.S. interests across the world, offering no
warning of its ally Egypt's 1973 surprise attack on Israel; aiding
communists in Angola, Portugal, and Vietnam; and rapidly expanding its
nuclear arsenal and investing heavily in its conventional military.
These were the bitter fruits of détente---a set of policies pioneered by
President Richard Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser, Henry
Kissinger, who stayed on and continued the approach under President
Gerald Ford. By using pressure and inducement, as well as downplaying
ideological differences, the United States tried to lure the Russians
into a stable equilibrium of global power. Under détente, Washington
slashed defense spending and soft-pedaled Moscow's human rights
affronts. The working assumption was that the Soviet Union's appetite
for destabilizing actions abroad would somehow be self-limiting.

But the Russians had their own ideas about the utility of détente. As
the historian John Lewis Gaddis observed, the Soviets "might have viewed
détente as their own instrument for inducing complacency in the West
while they finished assembling the ultimate means of applying
pressure---their emergence as a full-scale military rival of the United
States." Nixon and Kissinger thought détente would secure Soviet help in
managing crises around the world and, as Gaddis put it, "enmesh the
U.S.S.R. in a network of economic relationships that would make it
difficult, if not impossible, for the Russians to take actions in the
future detrimental to Western interests." But the policy failed to
achieve its goals.

President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977 intending to keep
détente in place, but the policy didn't work for him either. His attempt
to "de-link" Soviet actions that hurt U.S. interests from Soviet
cooperation on arms control ultimately yielded setbacks in both
categories. The Soviets became more aggressive globally, and a wary U.S.
Congress, having lost faith in Moscow's sincerity, declined to ratify
SALT II, the arms control treaty that Carter's team had painstakingly
negotiated. Meanwhile, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security
adviser, had grown increasingly skeptical of détente. Brzezinski felt
that a turning point had come in 1978, after the Soviets sponsored
thousands of Cuban soldiers to wage violent revolution in the Horn of
Africa, supporting Ethiopia in its war with Somalia. The Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan the following year was "the final nail in the coffin" for
arms control talks, Brzezinski wrote in his journal---and for the
broader policy of détente.

By the time President Ronald Reagan entered the White House, in 1981,
Nixon and Kissinger's invention was on its last legs. "Détente's been a
one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims,"
Reagan stated flatly in his first press conference as president,
effectively burying the concept.

Reagan sought to win, not merely manage, the Cold War. In a sharp
departure from his immediate predecessors, he spoke candidly about the
nature of the Soviet threat, recognizing that autocrats often bully
democracies into silence by depicting honesty as a form of aggression.
In 1987, when Reagan was preparing to give a speech within sight of the
Berlin Wall, some of his aides begged him to remove a phrase they found
gratuitously provocative. Wisely, he overruled them and delivered the
most iconic line of his presidency: "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall."

THE SMOKELESS WAR

Washington must adopt a similar attitude today and try harder to
disseminate truthful information within China itself and to make it
possible for Chinese citizens to communicate securely with one another.
Tearing down---or at least blowing holes in---the "Great Firewall" of
China must become as central to Washington's approach today as removing
the Berlin Wall was for Reagan's.

**[[Beijing is waging a bitter info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark} against

**[There are a lot of [factors]{.mark} that [point to
today]{.mark}]{.underline}** as **[[being the early stages of World War
III]{.mark}. Multiple [countries are]{.mark} involved [in open
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Many]{.underline}** more **[are
openly or surreptitiously supporting one or more of the
combatants.]{.underline}**

**[Russia]{.underline}**'s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is
supported by **[Iran]{.underline}**ian drones and missiles; **[North
Korean]{.underline}** troops, missiles, and ammunition; Chinese sub rosa
supply of advanced electronics needed for Russian weapon production; and
funding from others, including African countries which have enabled
Russian "private military companies" (which are, in fact, controlled by
Russian military intelligence---the GRU) to exploit natural resources,
especially gold, which is sold on the black market.

Twenty-five of the 26 NATO nations are supporting Ukraine with funds and
weaponry. The exception is Hungary under Victor Orbán, an autocrat like
Vladimir Putin. Others providing aid to Ukraine include Japan, South
Korea, and Australia.

In the Middle East, Iran and its surrogates (Hamas in the Gaza Strip;
Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria; and the Houthis in Yemen) have been in
open conflict with Israel since October 2023. Iran receives some support
from Russia. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria is a setback for
Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia.

Israel has been supported by many Western nations, especially the US,
which have supplied weaponry and especially air defense systems.
Neighboring nations over which ballistic missiles and drones fly
(Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait) have tried to remain neutral. Jordan
reportedly has shot down intruding Iranian drones aimed at Israel.

Islamist groups continue to attack their enemies in the Middle East and
South Asia. Pakistan and Afghanistan have attacked "enemies" in each
other's territories. The Islamic State remains active in Syria, Iran,
and in other nations where it has inspired lone wolf attacks, including
the US.

**[[There are]{.mark} other "[hot spots]{.mark}" that are ripe for
conflict eruption]{.underline}**. China's threats against
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** and hostile actions against the
Philippines in **[[the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}** could easily erupt into warfare.
**[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea's actions against South
Korea]{.underline}** are increasingly hostile in appearance and Kim
openly threatens the Indo-Pacific with his missile and nuclear programs.

When did this outbreak of wars start? Historians can point to Putin's
2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference when Putin, who thought
the collapse of the Soviet Union was a tragedy for Russia, expressed his
opposition to the world order that he blamed on the US. His policies
since have been distinctly anti-Western. He has sought to reassemble the
Russian empire of old. The Arab-Israeli hostility started long before,
some historians dating it to 1938 with British policies toward
Palestine. Since then Israel and its neighbors have fought seven wars.
Iran's hostility toward Israel since the 1979 revolution that brought
Ayatollah Khomeini and the mullahs to power exacerbated the situation.
The China-Taiwan hostile standoff dates from 1949 when the Chinese
Communist Party seized power on the mainland, but the Kuomintang fled
and seized the island of Formosa (Taiwan).

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 did not proceed as
planned. Now in its third year it has had unexpected consequences for
Moscow. NATO has expanded further with the addition of Finland and
Sweden. Western weapons have allowed Ukraine to bring the war to Russian
soil. Partly in response Russia has turned to hybrid warfare against the
West. Using intelligence agents, third parties, and recruited criminals
for sabotage in NATO countries, Russia has tried to undermine Western
support for Ukraine.

The Nov. 25 crash of air freight DHL's 737, which left Leipzig, Germany
for Vilnius, Lithuania is likely tied to Russian sabotage. DHL appears
to be a special target of Russian operatives. In July a DHL warehouse
fire in Leipzig has been linked to Russian agents. Also, there was a DHL
warehouse fire in Birmingham, UK on July 22. Lithuanian authorities have
arrest four people accused of sending incendiary devices from a DHL
store in Vilnius. One Western European intelligence official opined that
the attacks on DHL are practice runs for future sabotage of
transatlantic flights to the US and Canada.

Other recent hybrid warfare incidents include: An assassination plot
against Armin Papperger, the CEO of Germany's Rheinmettal, which
supplies Ukraine with ammunition; arson attacks in Lithuania and Latvia;
break-ins at water treatment plants in Finland, Sweden, and Germany;
widespread cyberattacks; and disinformation about Ukrainian elements
attacking a NATO facility in Romania. Multiple undersea cable breaks in
the Baltic appear to be tied to Moscow's hybrid warfare. Western
European officials indicate that the number of such incidents has
increased dramatically in 2024 and been described by Western
intelligence chiefs as increasingly reckless.

Reuters reported "On July 10, an individual identifying themselves as a
26-year-old Russian-speaking Estonian named Valeri Ivanov messaged a
Telegram account promoted on several pro-Kremlin social media feeds that
was looking for European nationals to conduct sabotage within their
countries." Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Britain have each
arrested suspected Russian-sponsored actors for sabotage and other
offences. Poland has arrested four people in connection with fires
charging them with conducting sabotage on behalf of a foreign
intelligence agency.

In October the heads of CIA and Britain's MI6 stated that Russia was
waging a "reckless campaign of sabotage" across the continent. US
officials have issued warnings to American defense companies to increase
their security precautions, blaming Russia for the increase in sabotage
in Europe.

Russia's hybrid attacks thus far have been careful not to cross a
threshold that might trigger Article 5 of the NATO Treaty whereby an
attack against one member is considered an attack on all. But things can
go wrong.

**[[Today's regional wars are linked]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A Russian
success in Ukraine worries many political scientists who fear **[that a
[defeat]{.mark} for the West, or a diminution of it]{.underline}**s
support for embattled nations, **[[will encourage other autocrats to
turn to]{.mark} outright [military action]{.mark} to achieve their
goals]{.underline}**.

The West needs to remember the historical lessons of Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Sept. 30. 1938 and Hitler's
subsequent takeover in March 1939 of the remainder of Czechoslovakia and
invasion of Poland in September.

**[The US remains the world's leading nation, but]{.underline}** given
the state of the world **[[it is no time to turn
inward]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Being a leader implies having
responsibilities. For the US, which believes in individual freedoms,
democracy, and justice, it is imperative to support those nations
threatened by aggressive autocrats seeking to expand their powers. In
Europe this includes Ukraine and neighboring Moldova which is facing
Kremlin-supported subversion. It also involves the Baltic states and the
Baltic Sea. Russian "shadow fleet" ships used to evade sanctions need to
be stopped and searched when sailing through NATO nation waters and
allowed to continue only if legitimately engaged in commerce. Expanded
sanctions ought to include aggressive expulsion of Russian "diplomats,"
and others identified as associated with its security services, and
restricted visa approvals.

In the Indo-Pacific region the US and its Quad partners need to continue
their enhanced support for Pacific island nations. Economic aid to
provide future employment opportunities is a long-term need. Expansion
of nations' domestic capabilities to enforce laws at sea, especially
focused on illegal fishing in exclusive economic zones, is especially
important as fish populations decline significantly. US presence is
fundamental to countering aggressive Chinese initiatives, including
usurious loans and the presence of Chinese police and "security" forces.
The volatile situations involving the Philippines and Taiwan, given that
Beijing consistently rejects established international law and
diplomacy, as well as North Korea's nuclear saber rattling, require
significant enhancements to US military power in the Western Pacific.

**[[The next few years will be difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many
autocrats see opportunities believing that the US' world position is
diminishing. **[[America needs]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
**[[strength]{.underline}]{.mark}**en its alliances worldwide. This will
require much diplomacy, investment, and attention **[[to limit]{.mark}

### LIO Turn---AT: Decline Inevitable---1AR

#### Heg decline not inevitable

**Nye 24**, former dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School and a
member of the Atlantic Council's Board of Directors Joseph, "Think the
American century is over? Think again.," Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/think-the-american-century-is-over-think-again/)

In this contentious election year, one of the most significant questions
is **[[whether we]{.mark} are [witnessing the end of an age]{.mark} in
which the United States has been]{.underline}** the
**[dominant]{.underline}** power. In my new memoir, A Life in the
American Century, I make a case for optimism.

I have lived through eight decades of an American era that included
World War II, Hiroshima, and wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and
Iraq. **[[The Cold War ended without]{.underline}]{.mark}** the nuclear
**[[catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}** that hung over our heads, **[[but
it]{.mark} [was replaced by]{.mark} a period of [hubris]{.mark} as the
United States became the world's sole superpower. [That unipolar
moment]{.mark} was soon [replaced by fears of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
transnational **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[cyber]{.underline}** wars. Analysts today speak about a new cold war
with a rising China and fear of nuclear escalation following Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. Our mental maps of the world have changed
dramatically over my lifetime.

For those eight decades, we have lived in what TIME publisher Henry
Luce, in March 1941, baptized "the American Century." In the nineteenth
century, the global balance of power was centered in Europe, which sent
its imperial tentacles around the world. The United States was a bit
player with a military not much larger than that of Chile. **[As the
twentieth century began, the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[became the world's largest industrial power,
and accounted for]{.underline}** nearly **[a quarter of the world
economy]{.underline}** (as it still does today).

When US President Woodrow Wilson decided to send two million troops to
Europe in 1917, the United States tipped the balance in World War I. But
afterwards, the United States "returned to normal" and, in the 1930s,
became strongly isolationist. It is more accurate to date the American
century to US President Franklin Roosevelt's entry into World War II in
1941. It was in that context, to resist isolationism and urge
participation in the war, that Luce coined his famous term. Some have
referred to an American empire, but our power always had limits. It is
more accurate to think of the American century as the period since World
War II during which time, for better or for worse, the United States has
been the preeminent power in global affairs.

**[[There is a case for pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the same
time, **[[we Americans]{.mark} have [survived worse]{.mark}
periods]{.underline}** in the 1890s, 1930s, and 1960s.

**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[remains]{.mark} the world's [strongest]{.mark}]{.underline}**
military **[[power]{.mark} as well as [the largest economy]{.mark},
but]{.underline}** since the 2010s **[[China]{.mark} has [become a
near-peer]{.mark}]{.underline}** economic
**[[competitor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and large parts of our country
have reacted negatively to the disruptions caused by globalization. As
yet, **[this contemporary era has no fixed label.]{.underline}**

So what sort of a world am I leaving to my grandchildren and their
generation? I tried to examine part of it in my 2015 book **[[Is the
American Century Over]{.underline}]{.mark}**? and concluded that the
**[answer]{.underline}** to that question **[was
"[no]{.mark},"]{.underline}** **[but]{.underline}** that American
**[primacy in this century will not look like the twentieth
century]{.underline}**. I argued that **[[the greatest danger]{.mark} we
Americans face [is]{.mark} not that China will surpass us, but
[that]{.mark} the [diffusion of power will produce]{.mark}
entropy]{.underline}**, **[or]{.underline}** the
**[[inability]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[to get anything
done]{.underline}**.

China is an impressive peer competitor with great strengths but also
weaknesses. In assessing the overall balance of power, the United States
has at least five long-term advantages. One is geography. The United
States is surrounded by two oceans and two friendly neighbors, while
China shares a border with fourteen other countries and is engaged in
territorial disputes with several. The United States also has an energy
advantage, whereas China depends on energy imports. Third, the United
States derives power from its large transnational financial institutions
and the international role of the dollar. A credible reserve currency
depends on it being freely convertible, as well as on deep capital
markets and the rule of law, which China lacks. The United States also
has a relative demographic advantage as the only major developed country
that is currently projected to hold its place (third) in the global
population ranking. Seven of the world's fifteen largest economies will
have a shrinking workforce over the next decade, but the US workforce is
expected to increase, while China's peaked in 2014. Finally, the United
States has been at the forefront in important new technologies (bio,
nano, and information). China, of course, is investing heavily in
research and development and scores well in the numbers of patents, but
by its own measures its research universities still rank behind US ones.

All told, **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [holds a strong]{.mark}
hand in this]{.underline}** great-power **[competition. [But if
Americans succumb to hysteria]{.mark} about China's rise or to
complacency about its "peak," [they could play]{.mark} their cards
[poorly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Discarding high-value
cards]{.underline}**---including strong alliances and influence in
international institutions---**[would be a serious
mistake]{.underline}**. China is not an existential threat to the United
States unless US leaders make it one by blundering into a major war. The
historical analogy that worries me is 1914, not 1941.

alliance unveiled by Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin presents a
formidable challenge to Western primacy. Yet, both Russia and China are
eager for an accommodation with the West. Despite his tough rhetoric
against the "collective West", Putin needs a deal with the US to secure
a new European compact in which Moscow can play a major role. President
Xi, whose soaring imagination about a post-Western order in Asia was
making waves a few years ago, is now promising President Joe Biden that
he is not seeking to overthrow the US-led order but seeking a dignified
coexistence.

In both **[[Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there is a long
lineage of political forces that seek Westernisation and integration
with the US-led order. They have had to battle the Russian "Slavophiles"
and Chinese nationalists who seek to define their national path in
non-Western if not anti-Western terms. The Westernisers in Russia and
China might be on the defensive now but have not disappeared from the
political scene. For both Putin and Xi, the question is not about
fighting a forever war with the West, negotiating favourable terms of
accommodation. Meanwhile, their **[[aggressive

compelling]{.mark} their [neighbours to move closer to the US]{.mark}
and enhance the power of the West]{.underline}**. **[For many in Europe
and Asia, America]{.underline}**, the distant power, **[is very welcome
in the effort to limit the power of the regional
hegemons]{.underline}**.

The story is not different **[[in the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Iran may be rocking the US-led order in
the region, but it is not strong enough to promote an
alternative]{.underline}**. **[Many [Arab regimes see Iran]{.mark} and
its proxies like Hamas [as a]{.mark} bigger [threat to their
existence]{.mark} than Israel]{.underline}**. **[For many Arab states,
the distant [America remains]{.mark}]{.underline}** a valuable and
**[[the only balancer]{.mark} against Tehran.]{.underline}**

**[What about the potential role of BRICS]{.underline}** as a bulwark
against the West? Well, Argentina has just declined to join the forum
--- the invitation was extended at the BRICS summit in South Africa last
year. Earlier, Indonesia had said it was not ready to join the forum
when the expansion was being discussed. In any case, the **[[deepening
contradictions]{.mark} [between India and China]{.mark} have [cast a
shadow over]{.mark} the [BRICS]{.mark} [and other non-Western
institutions]{.mark} like the SCO]{.underline}**, where both Delhi and
Beijing are members. The **[contradictions within the rest are
deep]{.underline}** and must always be factored in assessing the real
and serious tensions between the West and the rest.

**[What about the decline in the economic weight of the G7 in the global
economy]{.underline}**? To be sure, **[the share of G7's GDP has been on
a continuous decline]{.underline}** in the 21st century. **[Much of that
decline, though, has come from Europe. The US retains nearly 24 per cent
of the global GDP]{.underline}**. **[The relative economic decline of
Europe]{.underline}** vis-a-vis the US and China and its security
vulnerability vis-a-vis Russia **[will only help consolidate the West
under American leadership]{.underline}**.

**[Although the rise of the rest is real, [the West continues to lead
in]{.mark} the production of new [scientific knowledge]{.mark} and
[tech]{.mark}nological [innovation]{.mark}. Resilient economic and
political institutions cushion Western societies from internal
turbulence and external challenges. Western [academia]{.mark}, [think
tanks, arts and culture]{.mark} continue to exercise powerful influence
worldwide]{.underline}**. The broader attraction of Western societies is
reflected in the fact that **[millions of people
worldwide]{.underline}**, including from India, **[are eager to find a
way into Europe and North America]{.underline}**, either legally or
illegally. No amount of political posturing by their elites is going to
diminish the Western pull for Indian professionals, Chinese computer
geeks, Russian dissidents, and talented people from everywhere in the
world.

### LIO Turn---AT: Trump Isolates---1AR

#### Trump is an efficient leader, not an isolationist.

Policy Approach," The American Conservative,
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-cheap-hegemon-how-donald-trump-exemplified-a-new-foreign-policy-approach/)

**[[Critics of Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s foreign policy
**[[argued]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[his]{.underline}** "America
First" **[approach [risked alienating allies and emboldening
adversaries. However]{.mark}, his [strategy was
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** one of **[[isolationism,
but]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather of **[[selective engagement. Trump
understood]{.mark} the [importance of]{.mark}]{.underline}** maintaining
**[U.S. [leadership but]{.mark}]{.underline}** was intent on doing so
**[[in a way]{.mark} that [minimized]{.mark} unnecessary
[expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline}** and focused on the national
interest. **[In the Middle East, [for example]{.mark}, Trump brokered
the [Abraham Accords]{.mark}]{.underline}**, facilitating diplomatic
relations **[between Israel and]{.underline}** several **[Arab
nations]{.underline}**. This achievement underscored Trump\'s ability to
wield U.S. influence **[[without]{.mark} resorting to [military force
or]{.mark} costly [interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It was **[a
clear example of how]{.underline}** a cheap hegemon could **[maintain
and even expand]{.underline}** its **[influence through
diplomacy]{.underline}** and strategic partnerships, **[rather than
through force]{.underline}**. Donald **[[Trump\'s]{.mark} foreign
[policy was far from conventional]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and it sparked
considerable debate among policymakers and scholars alike. **[[However,
it]{.mark} undeniably [represented]{.mark}]{.underline}** a shift
towards a more **[[cost-conscious]{.underline}]{.mark}** form of
**[[global leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By emphasizing the
importance of reducing financial and human costs while maintaining U.S.
influence, Trump's approach exemplified the principles of the cheap
hegemon.

Whoever sits in **[the [Oval Office does not control all]{.mark} US
[foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** powers. The **[President and
Congress command different elements]{.underline}** of US foreign policy,
**[leading to frequent clashes. [Congress holds]{.mark} the [purse
strings, which means]{.mark}]{.underline}** the legislative branch gets
to "**[[influence]{.mark} nearly [all]{.mark} manner of [foreign
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** issues". In Congress, AUKUS has not only
its own caucus but also garners broad-based bipartisan support. Just as
**[[Congress]{.mark} \[[smashed]{.mark}\]]{.underline}** ~~blunted~~
**[[Trump's isolationist instincts]{.mark} by [passing]{.mark}
"[bipartisan]{.mark}]{.underline}** language in successive National
Defence Authorisation Acts
**[([NDAAs]{.mark}) [precluding]{.mark}]{.underline}** the Pentagon from
**[[reducing troops in]{.mark} South [Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}**", so
too **[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}**ional support **[[is]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** biggest and **[[best shield if]{.mark} a
[second]{.mark}-term [Trump sours]{.mark}]{.underline}** on AUKUS.
