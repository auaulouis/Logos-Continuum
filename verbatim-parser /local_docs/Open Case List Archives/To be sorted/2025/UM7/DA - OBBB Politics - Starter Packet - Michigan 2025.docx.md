reality]{.underline}]{.mark} for conservatives: As much as they want to
rail publicly about the legislation and the need to address any number
of pressing national emergencies in it, **[[very few are willing to
buck]{.underline}]{.mark}** President Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** on his biggest priority.

[[None of them are ready to cave]{.mark} just yet. But]{.underline} the
White House and their GOP colleagues increasingly believe that
[[three]{.mark} [senators]{.mark}]{.underline} in particular --- Sens.
Ron **[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Wisconsin, Mike
**[[Lee]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Utah **[and]{.underline}** Rick
**[[Scott]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Florida --- [[are now on
track]{.mark} to [support the bill]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Johnson, in particular, has softened his once-fierce criticism of the
legislation in recent days.

"We all want to see President Trump succeed," he said in a brief
interview this week. "Everybody is trying to help. That's why, if I seem
to have been striking a more hopeful tone, it's because I am more
hopeful."

Just a couple of weeks ago, Johnson was demanding near-unworkable levels
of spending cuts and warning that the bill would drive the nation off a
fiscal cliff. Then the Trump administration and members of Republican
leadership went to work.

Johnson made a pitch to Trump during a recent one-on-one phone call to
let him work with administration officials on his deficit reduction
plan. That led to a meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Kevin
Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council. A person with
knowledge of the meeting, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said
afterward that the White House is "optimistic that there's a path to
getting Johnson to yes."

Trump also privately urged Johnson during a meeting with other Finance
Committee Republicans last week to speak more positively about the bill.
The callout came after Trump officials --- and Trump himself --- grew
annoyed watching Johnson savage the bill on television.

His message: You should be out there selling this bill proudly, he told
Johnson, according to two White House officials granted anonymity to
describe the meeting --- arguing that even if he doesn't love every
detail, there was plenty in the bill for Republicans to be proud of.

"When the president says, 'Ron, you've been so negative, that's just not
even helpful,' I want to be helpful," Johnson said, acknowledging
Trump's message in the meeting and admitting he has "downplayed what is
good in the bill."

One of the White House officials summarized the approach to Johnson:
"Don't be negative to create leverage for yourself," the person said.
"If you want to negotiate, like, we can negotiate in private. We're all
reasonable people."

[The [hands-on efforts]{.mark} to win over Johnson [are part of a
larger]{.mark} [effort]{.mark} to try [to **help**]{.mark}]{.underline}
the **[[fiscal hawks]{.mark} [find]{.mark} a [soft
landing]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- and at least the semblance of some
concessions that will be able to hold up as wins in the end. That's
played out in face-to-face meetings with administration officials,
negotiations over pet provisions and discussions about how to continue
the fight to cut budget deficits down the road.

Being able to win over their deficit hawks would be a huge boon to
Majority Leader John Thune, who has acknowledged that he's got one hard
"no" vote in Sen. Rand Paul, who firmly opposes the bill's debt-ceiling
hike. Thune can only afford to lose three GOP senators, with Vance
breaking a tie.

That has given the fiscal hawks leverage, since the GOP leaders can't
afford to lose all of them, and that's on top of the other potential
headaches they have to navigate elsewhere in the conference.

To hear the [[fiscal hawks]{.underline}]{.mark} tell it, they [are
[sounding]{.mark} a **more [positive]{.mark} note**]{.underline} [about
their ability [to]{.mark} support the bill]{.underline} because the
administration is starting to take their demands seriously. To help
appease their holdouts, GOP leaders have tried to scrounge up additional
savings beyond what is included in the House bill.

"I believe **[we'll [get a deal done]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I'm doing
everything I can to represent my state," Scott said in a brief
interview.

GOP leaders are working to assuage Lee by tucking one of his top
priorities into the bill. The deregulatory proposal, known as the REINS
Act, was initially expected to run afoul of Senate rules for the
party-line reconciliation process, but leaders have been working to try
to find a version that could pass muster.

House conservatives, meanwhile, have grown increasingly worried that the
Senate, with the blessing of their fiscal-hawk allies, will send back a
bill that waters down some of their hard-fought victories. The House
Freedom Caucus has laid out public demands, while its members have met
privately with Lee, Scott and Johnson to strategize about additional
spending reductions and maintaining their policy wins.

The Senate hard-liners aren't ready to concede just yet. Senate Budget
Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has promised Johnson he will advance a
second reconciliation bill, giving conservatives another chance to enact
cuts. But Johnson said that wouldn't be enough to get him on board.
Instead he wants a "forcing mechanism" to maintain a longer-term push to
return to 2019 spending levels. He's letting the White House brainstorm
other ideas and described himself as "reasonably flexible."

Lee said in a statement he's "been working with my colleagues and the
White House to make the Big Bill Beautiful." But added: "It's not where
it needs to be yet."

"We need to sell federal land to help fix the housing crisis, terminate
benefits that flow to illegals, end the Green New Scam, and get rid of
the Medicaid provider tax. I want to see this effort cross the finish
line, but we need to do more," he added.

Even as they continue to push, their colleagues see the signs of late
softening --- and aren't surprised whatsoever. **["[They'll
fold]{.mark},"]{.underline}** [said a GOP colleague who was granted
anonymity]{.underline} to speak candidly.

[Sen.]{.underline} John [Hoeven]{.underline} (R-N.D.) [said that
[Republicans]{.mark} have "made progress" with Johnson and "I wouldn't
count him out." And two others]{.underline}, Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.)
and John Kennedy (R-La.), said they [expect Lee, Scott and Johnson to
**[come around when the bill comes up for a final vote]{.mark}**, even
if they don't ultimately love every provision]{.underline}.

"They're very gettable," Kennedy said. "At some point people are just
going to have to decide, is this good enough?"

**Carney** 2-27-20**25**, Congressional Reporter @ Politico (Jordain,
"Trump will finally have to jump into the GOP budget fight," Politico,
https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/trump-joins-congress-legislative-agenda-00206448)//BB

First, he wanted "one powerful Bill." Then he said he'd be OK with
splitting it in two. Later, he definitely wanted a single "BEAUTIFUL"
bill --- until a few days later when he praised senators for pursuing a
pair. "You could do three," he said the day after that. "You could do
10."

President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has never been especially
interested in how his vast domestic policy agenda gets enacted in
Congress --- happy instead to let the House and Senate duke out their
differences on Capitol Hill.

But GOP lawmakers are warning that the [**[hands-off
approach]{.underline}** [might not be sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for much longer,]{.underline} [with profound conflicts looming between
the House and Senate over tax policy, spending cuts and
more]{.underline}.

[So far, the results of the legislative derby have been excellent for
Trump]{.underline}: [Both chambers have now approved fiscal
blueprints]{.underline} for enacting border security, energy, defense
and tax legislation, [with [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} on Tuesday
[**[push]{.mark}**ing [the House version over the line with a
few]{.mark} [**well-placed calls** to Republican
holdouts]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Getting that]{.underline} "**[[big]{.underline}]{.mark}**, beautiful
**[[bill]{.underline}]{.mark}**" enacted, however[, [is going to
require]{.underline}]{.mark} more than
**[[cajoling]{.underline}]{.mark}** a few irritable lawmakers --- it
will require [making]{.underline} [tough presidential-level
decisions]{.underline} about thorny policy issues.

["**[He'll be very involved]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- I think
**[[he'll]{.mark} probably [need to be]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). "[[There's]{.underline}]{.mark} a lot of
[[distance between]{.underline}]{.mark} where the [[House
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} are [on
this."]{.underline}

Adding to the challenge is that Trump in recent weeks has been muddying
the waters, not clarifying which direction they ought to be flowing.

He has called for a permanent extension of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act --- a costly demand that could make it impossible to rein in budget
deficits --- while also ruling out drastic cuts to Medicaid, the joint
federal-state safety-net program that House Republicans are counting on
for savings.

Amid all of this, he has called for a balanced budget --- a fiscal
aspiration that neither the House nor the Senate plans come anywhere
near meeting. "Maybe by next year or the year after, but maybe even
sooner than that," Trump told reporters Wednesday.

Congressional Republicans are familiar with the unpredictable president
and his often contradictory policy demands. But [reconciling them into a
unified budget framework]{.underline} --- and, eventually, actual
legislation that can get enacted by the GOP's low-single-digit
majorities in the House and Senate --- [[will require
making]{.underline}]{.mark} tough [[choices]{.underline}]{.mark} they
say [that **[only the White House can settle]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

"**[[He's the most instrumental person]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said
Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.), who had a lengthy phone conversation with
Trump on Tuesday before she agreed to back the House budget. "[This
branch \[of [government\] has been very broken, so we
need]{.mark}]{.underline} someone like **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to help us to do our job."

A person in Trump's orbit granted anonymity to describe strategy said
[[the president has intentionally stayed on the sidelines early
on]{.mark}, using the House-Senate rivalry to move his agenda
forward]{.underline}. Having the Senate plan waiting in the wings, for
instance, helped House leaders get members to yes this week.

**[[The hands-off approach changed]{.underline}]{.mark}** Tuesday when a
handful of hard-line fiscal hawks held out on Speaker Mike Johnson's
budget plan, arguing it didn't cut enough federal spending.

"He wants to see something," the person said of Trump. "And if \[the
House budget\] failed, it would have looked like \[the\] GOP doesn't
have their shit together."

Besides Spartz, [Trump placed calls to]{.underline} several of the
[holdouts]{.underline}, according to Republicans familiar with the whip
operation. In the end, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only GOP
member to vote no.

One of the holdouts, Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett, said Trump's call had
"considerable" influence on his decision to back the budget measure:
"The president assured me that he would work towards cuts, and he's
never lied to me. ... I trust the president."

So far, GOP congressional leaders have used the phone-a-president button
sparingly, aware that they can't go running to Trump every time they
have a whip problem, said two Republicans granted anonymity to candidly
describe the dynamics between Trump and Congress.

A larger group of holdouts, including some more moderate members who
wanted assurances on Medicaid cuts, didn't get calls from Trump, the two
Republicans said --- they were won over with assurances from
congressional leaders who emphasized that no safety-net program is
mentioned in the budget plan. (Any actual cuts would be carried out in
subsequent legislation.)

But now Republicans are facing more profound divides, some of which got
hashed out in a White House meeting Wednesday attended by Johnson and
Senate Majority Leader John Thune along with Trump, Vice President JD
Vance and top administration economic officials.

Among the issues they discussed was the challenge of making Trump's 2017
**[[tax cuts]{.underline}]{.mark}** permanent --- a move that would add
trillions of dollars to the deficit. Some on Capitol Hill want to
essentially ignore that cost by changing the way they handle the bill's
accounting. That could allow tax writers to pursue other Trump
priorities, such as exempting tips from income tax, at the risk of
angering fiscal hawks who want to slow the growth of the national debt.

Getting it done, in other words, could **[[require Trump to weigh
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** publicly on the kind of otherwise in-the-weeds
policy matters he has previously ignored.

**[The [president]{.mark}]{.underline}**'s wishes **[[will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** "as **[[influential]{.underline}]{.mark}** if
not more as things get tougher," said Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida
Republican who met with Johnson this week as the budget debate heated
up. "The speaker is going to have to tee it up, going to tell him where
the ball lies, how it's lying, and then [the president is going to have
to execute]{.underline} the shot."

A more delicate matter will involve potential cuts to safety-net
programs that many Trump voters rely on. That includes above all
Medicaid, which could be targeted for hundreds of billions of dollars
worth of reductions under the House blueprint.

Trump has repeatedly said he has no plans to cut Medicaid or other
entitlement programs.

"I've said it so many times that you shouldn't be asking me that
question," he said Wednesday when pressed on it. "Read my lips ... we're
not going to touch it. Now, we are going to look for fraud."

Congressional leaders are hoping to expand the "fraud" loophole as wide
as possible. Johnson and other top House Republicans argued to skeptics
this week that eliminating waste, fraud and abuse could generate the
scale of savings they'd need to make the math work.

But many lawmakers, including Hawley, are doubtful the party can realize
those offsets without impacting their constituents. Trump, they believe,
will have to decide which Medicaid rollbacks he's comfortable with.

Already some House members have been in touch with White House officials
to argue for provisions they believe can be presented as tackling waste,
fraud and abuse --- not as cuts to benefits. While Trump has said
barring "illegal migrants" could generate huge savings, senior
Republicans aren't sure.

Inside the White House, meanwhile, [[there is rising faith in Trump's
ability to **bend the legislative branch** to his will]{.mark} as his
agenda moves forward]{.underline}. One administration official, granted
anonymity to speak candidly about interbranch relations, said [[Trump
is]{.underline}]{.mark} "always [**[active]{.mark}** **[in
negotiations]{.mark}** on Capitol Hill" [and is in **frequent touch**
with congressional leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} about how he can be most
helpful.

Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Neal, and distinguished members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on [the
importance of permanently [extending]{.mark}]{.underline} provisions of
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (**[[TCJA]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[**[benefit]{.mark}**ing working [families and]{.mark} privately-owned
[businesses]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a Certified Public Accountant with
over 35 years of experience working with individuals, small businesses,
and multigenerational family enterprises, I have seen firsthand how the
provisions of the [[TCJA]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[provided critical
support to]{.mark} the [businesses]{.mark} and families [that form the
**backbone** of our economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [TCJA]{.mark} provided several key [provisions]{.mark}]{.underline}
that have benefited all of my business and individual clients,
[including the 20% deduction for qualified business income]{.underline}
under Section 199A, [full bonus depreciation, lower marginal tax rates
across the board, doubling the standard deduction, the expanded child
tax credit, and the increased estate tax exemption]{.underline}. [These
provisions]{.underline} have not only [**[encouraged]{.underline}**
**[growth and investment]{.underline}**]{.mark} [but also [provided a
lifeline for small businesses]{.mark} and working families **[navigating
economic uncertainties]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As Congress currently debates how to move forward legislatively this
year, making **[[TCJA]{.underline}]{.mark}** provisions permanent
**[[should be priority number one]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Business]{.mark} owner**[s]{.mark}**, family enterprises, working
families and their advisors, [are desperately seeking **certainty and
predictability** related to tax policies]{.mark} right now]{.underline}.
Frequent or [[last-minute changes]{.mark} to the tax code
[create]{.mark} tremendous [uncertainty, making it difficult for
taxpayers to plan]{.mark} for the future. **[Without clarity]{.mark}**,
[businesses]{.mark} and families are likely to delay or [forgo
investments like hiring]{.mark} more workers, [increasing
salaries]{.mark}, [upgrading]{.mark} business [equipment]{.mark},
purchasing a first home, or opening a new college savings account for
their children [which could **stall economic**]{.mark} **[growth and
depress job creation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Congress needs to act
quickly and swiftly]{.underline}** [and **should avoid at all
costs**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[waiting until the fourth quarter to

As we look ahead, one cannot help but wonder if this threat of long-term
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** stagnation and [[**decline**
will]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[be the **catalyst** for **major
conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the future. For one, such [economic
[troubles]{.mark} could **[fuel]{.mark}**]{.underline} political
**[[radicalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[as]{.mark} it did [in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} 1920s and **[[1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At
the same time, [[rising]{.mark} levels of **protectionism** and
**[nationalism]{.mark}** could [lead to]{.mark} far worse [trade
disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} than we have seen in recent years,
[something that could]{.underline} also [turn an economic dispute into a
military conflict]{.underline}. Finally, [the [battle for **control**
of]{.mark} **strategic [resources]{.mark}** [such as oil]{.mark}, water,
land [or **rare-earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}
element**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[could **intensify**]{.mark}
**as**]{.underline} economic [**growth** slows, resulting in conflicts
over]{.underline} the control of these **[resources]{.underline}**.

[There are many examples of]{.underline} potential [[conflicts]{.mark}
between large]{.underline} economic [powers that [could
**erupt**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the years and decades ahead,
[**particularly** [if]{.mark}]{.underline} economic [[**growth**
continues to slow]{.underline}]{.mark} over the longer-term. For
example, tensions between the world's two superpowers, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**China**]{.underline}, [have risen]{.underline} steadily in recent
years, due in part to US concerns about China's rising economic and
military power. As [[there are]{.mark} a large number of
[**flashpoints** that could bring]{.mark} these two]{.underline} giant
[[powers into conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}
(**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, etc.),
[the likelihood of a superpower conflict is]{.underline} now
[greater]{.underline} than it has been at any time since the early
1980s.

[This is not the only potential great power conflict]{.underline} that
the world faces today. For example, [tensions between [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
**Russia**]{.mark} have]{.underline} [also been rising]{.underline} as
the latter seeks to regain some of the geopolitical importance and
influence that it lost in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet
Union. [The growing rivalry between **[China and India]{.mark}** is
another flashpoint that has the potential to **erupt**]{.underline} into
a conflict between two major economic powers, particularly [in light
of]{.underline} the [numerous border disputes]{.underline} between those
two Asian giants. In fact, [there are a number of]{.underline} potential
[[conflicts]{.mark} involving]{.underline} two or more [major economies
that [could **erupt**]{.mark} in the near-future]{.underline}, [any of
which would]{.underline} not only [be [influenced by **economic
factors**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but would also have a major impact on
the economies of the combatants, as well as on the global economy as a
whole.

"We need to sell federal land to help fix the housing crisis, terminate
benefits that flow to illegals, end the Green New Scam, and get rid of
the Medicaid provider tax. I want to see this effort cross the finish
line, but we need to do more," he added.

Even as they continue to push, their colleagues see the signs of late
softening --- and aren't surprised whatsoever. **["[They'll
fold]{.mark},"]{.underline}** [said a GOP colleague who was granted
anonymity]{.underline} to speak candidly.

[Sen.]{.underline} John [Hoeven]{.underline} (R-N.D.) [said that
[Republicans]{.mark} have "made progress" with Johnson and "I wouldn't
count him out." And two others]{.underline}, Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.)
and John Kennedy (R-La.), said they [expect Lee, Scott and Johnson to
**[come around when the bill comes up for a final vote]{.mark}**, even
if they don't ultimately love every provision]{.underline}.

"They're very gettable," Kennedy said. "At some point people are just
going to have to decide, is this good enough?"

#### PC is key

**Carney** 2-27-20**25**, Congressional Reporter @ Politico (Jordain,
"Trump will finally have to jump into the GOP budget fight," Politico,
https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/trump-joins-congress-legislative-agenda-00206448)//BB

First, he wanted "one powerful Bill." Then he said he'd be OK with
splitting it in two. Later, he definitely wanted a single "BEAUTIFUL"
bill --- until a few days later when he praised senators for pursuing a
pair. "You could do three," he said the day after that. "You could do
10."

President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has never been especially
interested in how his vast domestic policy agenda gets enacted in
Congress --- happy instead to let the House and Senate duke out their
differences on Capitol Hill.

But GOP lawmakers are warning that the [**[hands-off
approach]{.underline}** [might not be sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for much longer,]{.underline} [with profound conflicts looming between
the House and Senate over tax policy, spending cuts and
more]{.underline}.

[So far, the results of the legislative derby have been excellent for
Trump]{.underline}: [Both chambers have now approved fiscal
blueprints]{.underline} for enacting border security, energy, defense
and tax legislation, [with [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} on Tuesday
[**[push]{.mark}**ing [the House version over the line with a
few]{.mark} [**well-placed calls** to Republican
holdouts]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Getting that]{.underline} "**[[big]{.underline}]{.mark}**, beautiful
**[[bill]{.underline}]{.mark}**" enacted, however[, [is going to
require]{.underline}]{.mark} more than
**[[cajoling]{.underline}]{.mark}** a few irritable lawmakers --- it
will require [making]{.underline} [tough presidential-level
decisions]{.underline} about thorny policy issues.

["**[He'll be very involved]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- I think
**[[he'll]{.mark} probably [need to be]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). "[[There's]{.underline}]{.mark} a lot of
[[distance between]{.underline}]{.mark} where the [[House
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} are [on
this."]{.underline}

Adding to the challenge is that Trump in recent weeks has been muddying
the waters, not clarifying which direction they ought to be flowing.

He has called for a permanent extension of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act --- a costly demand that could make it impossible to rein in budget
deficits --- while also ruling out drastic cuts to Medicaid, the joint
federal-state safety-net program that House Republicans are counting on
for savings.

Amid all of this, he has called for a balanced budget --- a fiscal
aspiration that neither the House nor the Senate plans come anywhere
near meeting. "Maybe by next year or the year after, but maybe even
sooner than that," Trump told reporters Wednesday.

Congressional Republicans are familiar with the unpredictable president
and his often contradictory policy demands. But [reconciling them into a
unified budget framework]{.underline} --- and, eventually, actual
legislation that can get enacted by the GOP's low-single-digit
majorities in the House and Senate --- [[will require
making]{.underline}]{.mark} tough [[choices]{.underline}]{.mark} they
say [that **[only the White House can settle]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

"**[[He's the most instrumental person]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said
Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.), who had a lengthy phone conversation with
Trump on Tuesday before she agreed to back the House budget. "[This
branch \[of [government\] has been very broken, so we
need]{.mark}]{.underline} someone like **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to help us to do our job."

A person in Trump's orbit granted anonymity to describe strategy said
[[the president has intentionally stayed on the sidelines early
on]{.mark}, using the House-Senate rivalry to move his agenda
forward]{.underline}. Having the Senate plan waiting in the wings, for
instance, helped House leaders get members to yes this week.

**[[The hands-off approach changed]{.underline}]{.mark}** Tuesday when a
handful of hard-line fiscal hawks held out on Speaker Mike Johnson's
budget plan, arguing it didn't cut enough federal spending.

"He wants to see something," the person said of Trump. "And if \[the
House budget\] failed, it would have looked like \[the\] GOP doesn't
have their shit together."

Besides Spartz, [Trump placed calls to]{.underline} several of the
[holdouts]{.underline}, according to Republicans familiar with the whip
operation. In the end, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only GOP
member to vote no.

One of the holdouts, Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett, said Trump's call had
"considerable" influence on his decision to back the budget measure:
"The president assured me that he would work towards cuts, and he's
never lied to me. ... I trust the president."

So far, GOP congressional leaders have used the phone-a-president button
sparingly, aware that they can't go running to Trump every time they
have a whip problem, said two Republicans granted anonymity to candidly
describe the dynamics between Trump and Congress.

A larger group of holdouts, including some more moderate members who
wanted assurances on Medicaid cuts, didn't get calls from Trump, the two
Republicans said --- they were won over with assurances from
congressional leaders who emphasized that no safety-net program is
mentioned in the budget plan. (Any actual cuts would be carried out in
subsequent legislation.)

But now Republicans are facing more profound divides, some of which got
hashed out in a White House meeting Wednesday attended by Johnson and
Senate Majority Leader John Thune along with Trump, Vice President JD
Vance and top administration economic officials.

Among the issues they discussed was the challenge of making Trump's 2017
**[[tax cuts]{.underline}]{.mark}** permanent --- a move that would add
trillions of dollars to the deficit. Some on Capitol Hill want to
essentially ignore that cost by changing the way they handle the bill's
accounting. That could allow tax writers to pursue other Trump
priorities, such as exempting tips from income tax, at the risk of
angering fiscal hawks who want to slow the growth of the national debt.

Getting it done, in other words, could **[[require Trump to weigh
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** publicly on the kind of otherwise in-the-weeds
policy matters he has previously ignored.

**[The [president]{.mark}]{.underline}**'s wishes **[[will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** "as **[[influential]{.underline}]{.mark}** if
not more as things get tougher," said Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida
Republican who met with Johnson this week as the budget debate heated
up. "The speaker is going to have to tee it up, going to tell him where
the ball lies, how it's lying, and then [the president is going to have
to execute]{.underline} the shot."

A more delicate matter will involve potential cuts to safety-net
programs that many Trump voters rely on. That includes above all
Medicaid, which could be targeted for hundreds of billions of dollars
worth of reductions under the House blueprint.

Trump has repeatedly said he has no plans to cut Medicaid or other
entitlement programs.

"I've said it so many times that you shouldn't be asking me that
question," he said Wednesday when pressed on it. "Read my lips ... we're
not going to touch it. Now, we are going to look for fraud."

Congressional leaders are hoping to expand the "fraud" loophole as wide
as possible. Johnson and other top House Republicans argued to skeptics
this week that eliminating waste, fraud and abuse could generate the
scale of savings they'd need to make the math work.

But many lawmakers, including Hawley, are doubtful the party can realize
those offsets without impacting their constituents. Trump, they believe,
will have to decide which Medicaid rollbacks he's comfortable with.

Already some House members have been in touch with White House officials
to argue for provisions they believe can be presented as tackling waste,
fraud and abuse --- not as cuts to benefits. While Trump has said
barring "illegal migrants" could generate huge savings, senior
Republicans aren't sure.

Inside the White House, meanwhile, [[there is rising faith in Trump's
ability to **bend the legislative branch** to his will]{.mark} as his
agenda moves forward]{.underline}. One administration official, granted
anonymity to speak candidly about interbranch relations, said [[Trump
is]{.underline}]{.mark} "always [**[active]{.mark}** **[in
negotiations]{.mark}** on Capitol Hill" [and is in **frequent touch**
with congressional leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} about how he can be most
helpful.

#### Passage is key to [biotech]{.underline}. 

**Sullivan 24**, Editor of Policy and Medicine, Senior Vice President at

Trump Presidency Could Mean for the Life Sciences Industry." *Policy &
Medicine*,
https://www.policymed.com/2024/11/what-a-trump-presidency-could-mean-for-the-life-sciences-industry.html)//BB

With Donald Trump now confirmed as the President-elect, [the **[life
sciences]{.mark}** **industry** [is bracing for]{.mark}]{.underline}
[significant [policy shifts]{.mark}]{.underline} that could impact
everything from drug pricing to regulatory practices.
[Trump's]{.underline} [previous]{.underline} [term]{.underline} may
[offer clues about his likely approach to]{.underline} healthcare, Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, and trade policies, all of
which hold meaningful implications for [pharmaceutical
companies]{.underline}, **[biotech]{.underline}** firms,
[and]{.underline} healthcare [providers]{.underline}. Below, we explore
key areas of potential change and how the life sciences sector might
adapt to a new Trump administration.

FDA and Accelerated Approvals

During his prior administration, Trump championed a faster and more
flexible FDA approval process, prioritizing efficiency in getting new
therapies to market. His leadership saw the FDA streamline approvals,
especially for innovative treatments and emergency authorizations, as
witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With Trump back in office, [we may see a renewed push for even faster
approval pathways,]{.underline} which could benefit companies developing
[breakthrough therapies]{.underline}, particularly in oncology, [rare
diseases]{.underline}, [and gene therapy]{.underline}. However, an
increased emphasis on speed may also heighten public and clinical
scrutiny of drug safety, potentially challenging industry perceptions.

Drug Pricing and Reimbursement Policies

A central focus of Trump's healthcare agenda has been the reduction of
drug prices. His previous Most Favored Nation rule aimed to link United
States drug prices to those in lower-cost countries, though it faced
legal roadblocks and was ultimately suspended. Trump has already stated
that he no longer sees the need for this policy.

Even still, the life sciences industry can expect heightened pressure on
pricing transparency and accountability. Medicare price negotiations
could be re-evaluated, with implications for reimbursement rates and
market strategies. Companies may need to brace for increased regulatory
oversight on pricing practices and consider how transparency measures
could affect both reputation and revenue.

Domestic Manufacturing and Supply Chain Security

[[Trump's]{.mark} "[America First" policy]{.mark}]{.underline} has
historically [[promoted]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic
**[[manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} critical sectors, [such as
**[pharma]{.mark}**ceuticals]{.underline}. [His previous administration
encouraged **reshoring** **pharmaceutical** **production** to decrease
reliance on **international supply chains**, especially from countries
like China and India.]{.underline}

[[For]{.mark} the **[life sciences]{.mark} sector**]{.underline},
[Trump's presidency [may lead to **new incentives** for
U.S.-based]{.mark} **[manufacturing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Tax
breaks]{.underline}** or other financial encouragement [may be offered
to companies that **choose** to **relocate production** to the
**U**nited **S**tate]{.underline}s. While this push could support
domestic industry growth, it also brings potential supply chain
challenges and cost increases, as well as possible regulatory pressures
to balance safety and economic factors.

Trump's priorities to fix the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mark a
significant shift in the healthcare landscape. His return to office may
bring renewed efforts to modify or repeal certain ACA provisions,
including allowing states greater flexibilities in defining essential
health benefits, limiting the individual and employer mandates, and
reducing spending on Medicaid block grants. These changes may have a
potential impact on reimbursement for life sciences products.

Changes to the ACA or Medicare structure could alter reimbursement
frameworks and patient access. Companies in the life sciences field,
especially those with high-cost therapies, may see shifts in coverage
dynamics and will need to closely monitor how policy adjustments impact
patient access to innovative treatments.

Tax Policy and R&D Investment

[Trump's first term was marked by [corporate tax cuts and
incentives]{.mark} [for]{.mark} research and development
([R&D]{.mark}),]{.underline} [which [spurred growth in]{.mark} the
**[life sciences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} **[biotech]{.mark}
sectors**]{.underline}. [His tax policy favored]{.underline} investments
in [R&D]{.underline}, [[leading to **increased**
**innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark} and industry growth.

As President-elect, [Trump is expected to continue these pro-business
**tax policies**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} possible [[further
reductions]{.mark} in **corporate taxes** and **expanded R&D tax
credits**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} approach could [[provide a
favorable]{.mark} environment]{.underline} for investment, especially
[[for]{.mark} early-stage **[biotech firms]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
venture capital in the **[life sciences]{.mark} sector**]{.underline}.
However, balancing these incentives with overall economic health and
addressing potential fiscal concerns will be key.

#### Natural AND engineered diseases cause [extinction]{.underline} absent bio-pharma innovation

**Larsen 20**, Senior Advisor, Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies.
*et al*. (Nicklas, 6-25-2020, \"Future pandemics: A growing existential
risk\", *Medium*,
https://medium.com/copenhagen-institute-for-futures-studies/future-pandemics-a-growing-existential-risk-9c08f3d5358e)\-\--GrRv

We have entered the era of global risks that stem from both man-made and
natural sources, or a combination of both: climate change, a malevolent
super AI, nuclear bombs, **[[bioterror]{.mark}ism]{.underline}**,
cyber-attacks [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course,
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To further add to this complexity,
there are distinctions to make in this global risk landscape. A global
catastrophic risk is a hypothetical future event that could harm human
well-being on a global scale, even endangering or destroying modern
civilisation, whereas an event that possibly [[could lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** is
an existential risk, as the Swedish author and philosopher Nick Bostrom
defines it: 'One where an adverse outcome would either annihilate
Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically
curtail its potential'.

While some of these existential risks stem from nature and are thus out
of our control --- asteroid impacts or super volcanoes for example ---
other threats facing us are man-made. Throughout history, [human
ingenuity has produced technologies with **double-edged
capabilities**]{.underline}. Perhaps the most dramatic example came with
the capability to harness the atom, with nuclear power and nuclear
weapons being the by-products. This marked the dawn of a new epoch in
which humankind achieved the ability to destroy itself, with a few very
close calls happening especially during the Cold War. Since then,
nuclear weapons have now been joined by other emerging technological
risks such as nanotechnology and AI.

THE EXPANDED RISK LANDSCAPE OF PANDEMICS

Although it has been a novel experience for most people living through
it, the [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [was **not**]{.underline} an
**[unanticipated]{.underline}** event. In fact, a respiratory
virus-enabled pandemic like COVID-19 was deemed likely or even expected
by virologists. [[The **interconnectedness** of]{.mark} modern-day
[civilisation]{.mark} has [made it]{.mark} **much [easier]{.mark} [for a
pandemic to spread]{.mark}**]{.underline} globally in days or weeks
rather than months, and the frequency of outbreaks is accelerated by
ecosystem collapse, demographic developments and global warming. [[In
any]{.underline}]{.mark} given [[month]{.mark},]{.underline} [The [World
Health]{.mark}]{.underline} [O]{.underline}rganization now
[[traces]{.underline}]{.mark} roughly [**[7.000]{.mark} signals** of
**[potential outbreaks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, conducts 300 follow-ups,
and leads 30 investigations. In the month of June 2018, for the first
time ever, the WHO tracked outbreaks of six of the eight of the
'priority communicable diseases', like Zika and MERS happening at the
same time. WHO's list of potential outbreaks also includes 'Disease X',
representing the fact that [a **future epidemic** or **pandemic** could
also be caused by a pathogen **unknown** to us at the current
time]{.underline}. Below, we take a closer look at some of the [[global
trends]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[will **accelerate the emergence** and
**spread of disease**]{.mark} in the future.]{.underline}

The rise of megacities

The transition from rural to urban life is a defining characteristic of
our age. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's 9,8 billion people will live
in urban areas, up from around half of the world population living in
cities today. This movement of people from the countryside to cities is
driven by the promise of increased economic opportunity, access to
healthcare, connections, education, and increased mobility. During the
next decade, [the number of **megacities**]{.underline} (defined as 10
million inhabitants or more) [will increase to 39]{.underline} by adding
Chicago, Bogota, Luanda, Chennai, Baghdad, and Dar es Salaam to the
list. With more than 80% being in low- or middle-income countries,
**[megacities]{.underline}** with large parts of the populations living
in slums [**heightens the risk** of disease **spreading effortlessly**.
Novel outbreaks will have fertile ground for spreading
**exponentially**]{.underline}, as seen in [**metropoles** and **travel
hubs**]{.underline} of today like New York City. The
[[megacities]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [future [will be **densely
populated**]{.mark}]{.underline} hubs for transnational commerce,
mobility, [[and **hyper-connected** which]{.underline}]{.mark} all
**[[amplify pandemic risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With the growing risk
of pandemics occurring in the future, the need to bolster the pandemic
resilience of cities will only get more pressing. Researchers at the
Senseable City Lab at MIT offer a glimpse into some of the features of
the pandemic-proof city of the future. As part of their project named
'Underworlds', they placed sensors in sewers to detect concentrations of
illegal drugs and harmful bacteria in specific areas. The researchers
propose to develop a new kind of human health census by sampling the
'urban gut' and thus providing early signals of things like contagious
disease with geographical precision. A city built with lessons from
pandemics might be filled with systems such as these to help map the
spread of disease. While technology can get us some of the way, it can't
solve some of the more structural issues that lie at the heart of why
and how outbreaks of disease become epidemics or pandemics. Outbreaks of
disease tend to hit underprivileged or marginalised population groups
the hardest, and to effectively curb the spread of disease in the
future, we not only need to expand our urban and technological
resilience, but arguably (and chiefly) our social and community
resilience as well.

Global warming and increased human-wildlife interfacing

Pandemics and global warming remind us that nature is powerful, and that
despite all our modern gadgets, we are still subject to its
temperaments. Our current situation is a terrifying harbinger of the
pandemics that can be brought about in the future if global warming
continues to further destabilise the natural world. Already today,
global warming is exposing new threats. The warming planet is melting
permafrost that has been frozen for decades or longer, releasing ancient
viruses and bacteria that have lain dormant. Out of the meltwater,
smallpox or the Spanish flu could be given a second chance, or something
completely different we do not want to discover could be 'released' into
the world. Rising global temperatures are also expanding the
geographical reach of diseases like zika, dengue fever, and malaria, as
these infectious diseases and their vectors, like mosquitos, thrive
better in a warmer and a more humid climate. Additionally, global
warming is also changing the water cycle, leading to heavier rainfalls
and higher risks of floods, and consequently spreading water-borne
diseases like cholera. This is especially problematic in the world's
poorest regions which are unable to invest heavily in climate mitigation
infrastructure.

COVID-19 breached natural boundaries at the interface between human
activity and wild ecosystems. [A major factor driving]{.underline} such
[**spillover events** is the loss of **natural 'buffers'** between
humans and wild ecosystems]{.underline}, exemplified [through
**deforestation**]{.underline}, bushmeat hunting, and the traditional
Asian open wet markets. Additionally, the world's [[growing demand
for]{.mark} domesticated [meat is]{.mark}]{.underline} greatly
increasing the number of pigs and chickens on the planet, [[**increasing
the chances** of]{.mark} a pig or avian [influenza to **make the
jump**]{.mark} from **animals** to **humans**.]{.underline}

Democratisation and proliferation of biotechnology

In the past two centuries, we went from discovering the world of
microbes invisible to the human eye to growing them in petri dishes,
sequencing their genomes and now, altering their DNA. Just in the past
10 years, [[we]{.mark} have [see]{.mark}n **major
[breakthroughs]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} our
**[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological capabilities, [[such
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of **[[gene
drives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the genetic cut-and-paste tool
**[[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}**-Cas9, [and]{.underline} the world's
first [genetically modified babies]{.underline}. A gene drive is a
genetic mechanism by which a desired genetic sequence can be spread
through a population faster than traditional inheritance.

This strategy can be so effective that traits can spread even if they
result in a disadvantageous trait, such as sterility. Thus, gene drives
present potential new solutions for a variety of issues facing humanity,
including eradicating, or altering disease carriers such as mosquitoes
and controlling invasive species of plants, insects, or toads. What is
worrisome, however, is that these biotechnological breakthroughs are not
only in the hands of state actors and institutions. The rapid
democratisation of biotech has made these powerful tools increasingly
available to groups from the undergraduate biologist to the DIY
biohacking communities.

When the first human genome was sequenced in 2001, it took almost 15
years and the cost was around \$2,6 billion. Today, a genome can be
sequenced in an hour for a price of less than \$1.000. While our growing
biotechnological knowledge has benefits, it is a double-edged sword and
can be misused --- intentionally or unintentionally --- in ways that can
cause great harm. [As the number of people with access to the technology
grows, so does the risk for the technologies to be **misapplied** with
**deadly**]{.underline} and global **[impact]{.underline}**.

Error or terror: bad bugs or bad guys?

A biotechnological catastrophe may be caused by an engineered organism
being accidentally released from controlled research environments, by
the planned release of such an organism which then turns out to have
unforeseen and catastrophic interactions with ecosystems, or by
intentional usage of biological agents in biological warfare or
bioterrorism attacks. The existential risks posed by most scientific and
medical research is negligible. However, there is ongoing research into
live agents of smallpox, SARS, H5N1, and avian flu, which, if escaped
mistakenly, could wreak havoc. It is likely possible to engineer
pathogens that are even more dangerous than the natural strains by
increasing their incubation time, transmissibility, lethality, or
resistance to vaccination and treatment. [[Research]{.mark} by
well-intentioned actors [into potential pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline}
of pandemic, both natural --- and down the road synthetic --- [is a path
society [can]{.mark} pursue to try to **[stay one step ahead of bad
actors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by exploring]{.mark} the space of
[possibilities and prepare adequately]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Engineering
pathogens to study them]{.underline} of course [comes with its own set
of dangers, but [the]{.mark} **[benefits to resiliency]{.mark} might
[outweigh the risks]{.mark}**]{.underline} and thus presents a fine line
to be walked by the scientific community and its regulators. The
technological means to genetically modify pathogenic characteristics are
likely to become more widely available in the future. [The]{.underline}
main [candidate for **biological existential risk**]{.underline} in the
coming decades thus [stems from]{.underline} our own technology and
particularly [the risk of **misuse** by groups]{.underline} or even
individuals. Capabilities that were once only in the hands of
governments and universities are increasingly moving into the living
rooms and garages of individuals. Nick Bostrom from The Oxford Future of
Humanity Institute estimates from a survey among researchers a 5%
probability of a pandemic of catastrophic proportions (1 billion deaths)
from natural sources by 2100 and estimate a 10% probability from an
engineered pandemic.

### Will Pass

#### Progress is being made to overcome obstacles and meet July 4^th^ deadline

**Bolton, 6/19**/2025 (06/19/25 6:00 AM ET, Alexander Bolton, "GOP
leader aggressively woos GOP Medicaid holdouts on Trump bill,"
https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5358330-medicaid-spending-cuts-senate-republicans/,
JMP))

Senate Majority Leader John [[Thune]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-S.D.) [is
[making]{.mark} an aggressive bid to win over]{.underline} Senate
Republican [colleagues who have balked at]{.underline} hundreds of
billions of dollars in [Medicaid]{.underline} spending [cuts, [hoping to
clear obstacles]{.mark}]{.underline} in time to bring the bill to the
floor next week.

[Thune is under pressure [to speed up]{.mark} the pace of
[talks]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [[to meet the July 4
deadline]{.underline}]{.mark} President [Trump set]{.underline} for
Congress to pass the bill --- a deadline the Senate risks blowing past.

[[Republican]{.mark} senators who have voiced concerns]{.underline}
about tough new restrictions on states' ability to use health care
provider taxes to collect more federal Medicaid funding say they [[are
working with Thune]{.underline}]{.mark} on proposals [to help rural
hospitals]{.underline} in their states from going out of business.

GOP senators are in discussion with Thune and Senate Finance Committee
Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) about provisions related to Medicaid's work
and eligibility requirements.

[[They are also hashing out their concerns]{.mark} that the Senate bill
would shift too much of Medicaid's costs onto the states and
lower-income]{.underline} Americans.

"We're looking for solutions, and without getting into specifics or the
details, but we're just talking through some potential options," Thune
told reporters Wednesday afternoon.

[Republican [sources familiar with the negotiations say they expect
Senate GOP leaders and the holdouts to **work out some sort of
deal**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to provide direct financial assistance to
rural hospitals]{.underline} that would be in danger of closing if the
Senate bill passes in its current form.

"I have been supporting the inclusion of a provider-relief fund aimed at
rural hospitals, nursing homes and community health centers," Sen. Susan
Collins (Maine), one of the Republican holdouts, told The Hill.

Collins has repeatedly voiced her concern that limiting states' ability
to collect more federal funding through health care provider taxes could
have a devastating effect on rural hospitals in Maine.

GOP senators say [Thune is under pressure to move quickly to round up
Senate Republican holdouts]{.underline} to meet Trump's July 4 deadline.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Republican senators at a
lunch meeting Wednesday that Trump expects them to stick to his
timeline.

Sen. Kevin [Cramer]{.underline} (R-N.D.) [said]{.underline} after the
lunch meeting that the plan is to get the bill to the floor by the end
of the day Wednesday.

"My [expectation is **[there will be concessions]{.mark}** all
around]{.underline}," he said of Thune's negotiations with Republican
lawmakers who are balking at the cuts to Medicaid spending in the bill.

["[There are still things to work out]{.mark}]{.underline} to get to a
majority. [Sometimes [that can't]{.mark} really [happen until you start
putting things on the floor,"]{.mark}]{.underline} he added.

He said that Wiles told GOP senators: "Get \[it\] done and let's finish
it next week."

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has criticized the Senate bill sharply for
cutting off a major supply of funding for rural hospitals, said he's
proposed several options to Senate GOP leaders to keep hospitals in his
home state in business.

He has argued that rural hospitals should not lose money to slow down
the phaseout of renewable energy tax credits, another key component of
the Senate legislation.

"The right thing to do is not defund rural hospitals to pay for your pet
projects," Hawley said. "If you want your pet project in the bill, go
find your own money. Don't defund rural hospitals."

Sen. Lisa [[Murkowski]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-Alaska) [[said]{.mark} the
[talks]{.mark} with leadership are [moving in the right
direction]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"There's still a lot of moving parts," she said, adding that the

#### PC will overcome differences among GOP factions

**Barbaro 6-5**-2025, journalist @ NYT and host of The Daily (Michael,
et al, The Daily Podcast,
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-big-ugly-battle-over-the-big-beautiful-bill/id1200361736?i=1000711474601)

That's right. But what ends up happening is House Republican leaders do
end up taking the sledgehammer to this legislation, to these tax
credits. And [[by the time the]{.mark} [bill comes to the
floor]{.mark}]{.underline} and House [[Republicans are]{.mark} being
[pressured by]{.mark} President [Trump to vote for
it]{.mark}]{.underline}, all of these
**[[lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** who signed on to that letter,
including Congressman Ciscomani, [**[end up voting for this
bill]{.mark}** that is carrying]{.underline}, really, [the centerpiece
of President Trump's domestic agenda]{.underline}.

michael barbaro

Right. And so that's the way in which, thinking back to what you said at
the beginning of this conversation, [this bill becomes a kind of
existential question]{.underline} for some of these lawmakers about what
it means to represent Republican constituents. I mean, this Congressman
Ciscomani is being asked, in some sense, [**[to show]{.underline}** his
**[loyalty to the president]{.underline}**]{.mark} over the workers in
his district.

catie edmondson

That's right. And by the way, that's one of the reasons why House
Republican leaders wanted to contain all of these provisions into one
big, beautiful bill, right? They did it because they wanted to force
these lawmakers to take one single up or down vote, essentially on
President Trump himself.

michael barbaro

Fascinating. In other words, just take one hard vote on behalf of your
president, and then you're off the hook.

catie edmondson

Or, more cynically, you get one chance to show whether you're with us or
against us.

michael barbaro

Hmm. So [[the president managed to **overcome** the **reservations** of
House Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} when it came to gutting the
Inflation Reduction Act. Now that this bill is headed to the Senate,
which must pass it for this bill to ever have a shot of becoming law,
what are senators saying about these IRA cuts?

catie edmondson

Well, we're hearing a lot of the same concerns.

archived recording (lisa murkowski)

We will be going through, I think, a fair amount of changes over here on
the Senate side.

catie edmondson

Senators like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, for example.

archived recording (john curtis)

There are a lot of things that I'm watching very carefully, as I'm very
public about my view of how we should treat the energy tax credits. And
it's not that I feel like we shouldn't touch them, but I just think we
should be thoughtful.

catie edmondson

And John Curtis of Utah. But even in the past couple of days, Michael,
there have been additional Republican senators who have started to come
out of the woodwork to say that there are clean energy projects in their
states as well that they want to protect in a way that has actually been
quite surprising to me. I think the well of resistance around, again,
trying to gut this law entirely is actually deeper than I had
anticipated.

michael barbaro

Suggesting in a way that I don't think I quite understood that President
Biden's most important single piece of legislation has really woven
itself into the fabric of this country in a pretty meaningful,
bipartisan way.

catie edmondson

That's right. And by the way, not a single one of those Republican
senators voted for that law. Yet here we are, three years later, and you
have all of these Republicans defending it. And that, I think, was part
of the idea behind the law itself, was the idea that so many of these
projects would go to Republican districts, to Republican states. There
would be a bipartisan mandate to protect it, even if a Republican won
the White House. So that is one Democratic law that is proving to be
harder for Republicans to kill than maybe some had anticipated.

michael barbaro

Right.

catie edmondson

But I think that fight is really going to pale in comparison, honestly,
to what I think is [[the marquee fight]{.underline}]{.mark} at the
center of this legislation, which I think [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
going to be Republicans' efforts to cut into another major Democratic
initiative, which was expanding access to
**[[Medicaid]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

michael barbaro

Right. And we will talk about what it means to touch that third rail
after the break.

So Catie, tell us more about the proposed cuts within this bill to
Medicaid and, for those who are not intimately familiar with it, exactly
what Medicaid does.

catie edmondson

Well, Medicaid is really one of three major programs that make up the
heart of the social safety net here in the United States. There's Social
Security, there's Medicare, and there's Medicaid. And right now,
Medicaid provides health insurance for about 71 million disabled and/or
low-income Americans.

michael barbaro

Right, it's a really big deal.

catie edmondson

It is a big deal. And the proposal that this legislation puts forward
would impose new work requirements on people who receive health care
coverage through Medicaid. And, Michael, these are the most stringent
work requirements that congressional Republicans have ever put forward.

michael barbaro

In other words, these are requirements that say you don't get your
Medicaid unless you have some form of employment.

catie edmondson

Well, it actually even goes further than that. It allows states to say
you can't enroll in Medicaid unless you can prove to us, in some cases,
that you've been working for six months or even a year prior to your
attempt to enroll in the program.

michael barbaro

And this, of course, plays into a long-running Republican critique of
the US social safety network, which is that it does not require, many
Republicans would argue, enough of those receiving the benefits.

catie edmondson

I think it's fair to say that the idea of work requirements is broadly
very popular amongst congressional Republicans. But where we're seeing
major concerns is from Republicans who are now looking at the numbers of
what some of the consequences of these new policies would be, and are
starting to feel pretty skittish about voting for it. And, Michael, the
number that comes to mind is that that Nonpartisan Budget Office has
projected that these changes are going to lead to about 10 million
Americans losing their health care insurance.

michael barbaro

Wow, that's a lot of people suddenly without health insurance. That's
right. And look, this was the major Democratic initiative of President
Obama's term, that through the Affordable Care Act, through Obamacare,
the number of people who could benefit from Medicaid was drastically
expanded, to the point where we now have 40 states plus DC that have
opted into the Medicaid expansion program, essentially.

catie edmondson

And what happened was that those expansions created a lot of new
constituencies on Medicaid. And so what we're seeing now is that you now
have a lot of Republican voters who are benefiting from the expansion.
And you have a lot of rural hospitals, again, in some of these more
conservative areas, that have really come to rely on Medicaid.

michael barbaro

Hmm. So a lot like the proposed cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act,
these proposed cuts to the expansion of Medicaid run up against the
reality that Republicans and Republican voters have become big
stakeholders in this thing, in Medicaid.

catie edmondson

That's right. And Michael, earlier this year, I went out to a
Republican-held district in California, in Bakersfield. And that is a
district that is always politically hotly contested. It is held right
now by a Republican, David Valadao. And Michael, 2/3 of Congressman
Valadao's constituents get their health coverage through Medicaid.

michael barbaro

Wow.

archived recording (melissa)

My name is Melissa. I will be the MC tonight. I am the organizer ---

catie edmondson

I went to a town hall that was sort of rallying around trying to protect
the program.

archived recording (melissa)

In our district, over 500,000 people are supported by the Medicaid
system ---

catie edmondson

And it really was a stunning array of different types of people,
honestly, who came out to that event.

archived recording 4

We have a single daughter. Nobody wants to take care of it because it's
a lot of work.

catie edmondson

There were moms of disabled kids who were talking about how important
the program was in ensuring that their kids got the services they
needed.

archived recording 5

Meeting our veterans, meeting everyone here in the room.

catie edmondson

There were a number of veterans who were there, who were reliant on
Medicaid.

archived recording 6

Raise it. Come on, dude. People voted for you. And we are counting on
you.

catie edmondson

And it's something that Congressman Valadao was acutely aware of.

archived recording (david valadao)

I've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can
afford health care is through programs like Medicaid. And I will not
support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.

catie edmondson

Congressman Valadao actually went to the House floor to say that he was
not going to lend his vote to any legislation that cut the benefits his
constituents received from Medicaid.

But ---

archived recording (david valadao)

Work requirements, things like that, are things that we look at as a way
to protect those who need it and should be on it. And so we're having
that dialogue.

catie edmondson

He also made the case that imposing work requirements wouldn't really
cut benefits for any, quote unquote, "worthy or needy" recipients.

archived recording (david valadao)

I mean, I know you hear it a lot --- waste, fraud, and abuse. But there
are people who are on the program that shouldn't be on the program. So
the goal ---

catie edmondson

And so at the end of the day, when the bill comes to the floor,
Congressman Valadao votes to pass the bill.

michael barbaro

Much the way Ciscomani did when he voted for this bill, despite knowing
it would probably hurt the auto company in his district in Arizona. In
both cases, you've got these Republican House members backing this bill
that, on some level, they know is going to hurt their constituents.

catie edmondson

That's right. And it's actually an argument that we're starting to hear
over in the Senate, made by at least one Senate Republican very
forcefully.

archived recording (josh hawley)

It is wrong to cut health care for the working poor. That's what we're
talking about here with Medicaid. My state is a Medicaid ---

catie edmondson

And that's Josh Hawley of Missouri.

archived recording (josh hawley)

And I'm totally opposed to that. Republicans now, thanks to Donald
Trump, are the party of the working class.

catie edmondson

And his whole argument, essentially, is that Republicans have just made
really remarkable inroads in winning over working class voters.

michael barbaro

Right.

catie edmondson

His argument is, why would we, as Republicans, immediately turn around
and push through legislation that would hurt them?

archived recording (josh hawley)

I hope this bill will get refocused on delivering relief for working
families. That's what we ought to be doing.

michael barbaro

And that, of course, dovetails with what our colleague Shane Goldmacher
just told us a couple of days ago on "The Daily," which is that Trump
has expanded the Republican share of the working class vote in each of
the last three presidential races, more each time, thereby, as Hawley
has said, cementing the Republican brand as the political party of the
American working class. And it seems what Hawley is asking is, why would
you ever betray those voters? Why would you give up that extraordinary
electoral advantage that Republicans have created?

catie edmondson

That's right. And he has some very recent political history to back him
up on this, right? If you remember, in 2018, Republicans, again, had a
trifecta. They had used that trifecta to try to repeal the Affordable
Care Act. That effort failed. But Democrats made the strategic decision
to run exclusively, really, on health care during that midterm cycle.

And look, there are a number of congressional Republicans who distinctly
remember that blue wave in 2018. And one of them is actually the
congressman we were just talking about, David Valadao of California, who
was in Congress in 2017, voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and
actually lost his election. He came back, but he lost in 2018, after he
took that vote.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

catie edmondson

So here we are again, and we're already seeing some previews of how this
could play for them in the midterms.

\[MUSIC PLAYING\]

We saw Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, for example ---

archived recording (joni ernst)

That's because they're not currently eligible by the original definition
of Medicaid. And they will be ---

catie edmondson

--- being asked at a town hall in her state about the impacts of these
cuts to Medicaid. The constituents said people are going to die as a
result of these cuts, to which Senator Ernst responded ---

archived recording (joni ernst)

Well, we all are going to die. So for heaven sakes ---

catie edmondson

We're all going to die.

michael barbaro

Right, an unusual response.

catie edmondson

It ignited a firestorm in a normally pretty reliably conservative state,
I think, because it came off as sounding pretty callous, given the
stakes.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

catie edmondson

And so there's a sense among Democrats that this is going to be an
extraordinarily resonant issue among voters.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, it would seem like the only reason for Republicans to
back these work requirements that would end up kicking so many of their
working class voters off of Medicaid is that it puts a real dent in the
new spending from this bill. But from what you said at the beginning of
our conversation, the bill is not balanced. It's adding to the deficit.
So how much money would these Medicaid changes actually save?

catie edmondson

Well, the number that we got today from the Budget Office is that just
the health care changes would save \$1 trillion. But the problem for a
lot of Republicans is that that still leaves that \$2.4 trillion hole in
this legislation.

michael barbaro

Right, which is where you get your critique from the Elon Musks of the
world.

catie edmondson

That's right. And it's not just Elon Musk. It would be a lot easier for
Republicans if it was limited to Elon. But there's actually a number of
Republican senators right now who are saying that they do not want to
vote for this bill that is going to saddle their grandchildren with
debt.

archived recording (rand paul)

The math doesn't really add up. One of the things this big and beautiful
bill is, is it's a vehicle for increasing spending for the military.

catie edmondson

Those are Republicans like Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of
Wisconsin.

archived recording 7

We have to reduce the deficit. And so we need to focus on spending,
spending, spending.

archived recording 8

So what change ---

archived recording 7

You don't defeat the deep state by funding it.

archived recording 8

Right. So what changes ---

catie edmondson

They are tremendously disappointed, to use a nice word, in the number of
spending cuts contained in the House-passed bill. They've said they want
to agitate for even more.

archived recording (rand paul)

Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax
cuts before. But at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt
ceiling.

catie edmondson

And you even have some Republicans, like Senator Paul, saying that
there's actually an additional provision of this legislation that he
despises, which is a provision that would lift the debt limit by about
\$4 trillion, which would basically get us over the mid-term elections
because Senator Paul is one of a number of Republicans in Congress who
do not want to add to the nation's debt problem, who have sort of an
existential problem with lending their vote to any piece of legislation
that raises the debt ceiling.

michael barbaro

And we should say, it is not just scattered congressional Republicans
who have raised questions about the fiscal impact of this legislation.
There are economists and there are prominent people in American finance
who regard this bill as a genuine threat to America's financial future.

catie edmondson

That's right.

michael barbaro

And as a result, you can now argue --- and some Republicans are --- that
the bill betrays two different kinds of Republican Party values and
identities --- a new one and an old one. It portrays the party's new
conception, as Josh Hawley said, of itself as champions of the working
class by kicking so many people off Medicaid, and it portrays the
party's old conception of itself as the steward of fiscal
responsibility.

And in that way, I'm now very much understanding your point early on in
this conversation that this bill really does raise questions about what
it means to be a Republican when Trump is pushing this version of
Republicanism.

catie edmondson

That's right. I think [[we always knew]{.mark} that [there was going to
be]{.mark} kind of open [warfare between the two
factions]{.mark}]{.underline}, right, that you just talked about, the
[Republicans like]{.underline} Senator [**[Hawley]{.mark}**, who are
[saying]{.mark}, [we]{.mark} simply [can't pay for tax cuts at the
expense of working class]{.mark} voters]{.underline} who, by the way,
voted for us, and that we knew that he was going to be
[[clashing]{.underline} [with senators]{.underline}]{.mark}
[like]{.underline} Senator Ron **[Johnson]{.underline}**, Senator Rand
**[Paul]{.underline}**, [[who]{.underline}]{.mark}, again,
[[want]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[deep]{.mark} spending
[cuts]{.mark}]{.underline} to be able to vote for a deficit neutral
bill.

Now, I think it's most likely that neither of them are going to get
their way here, and that instead, **[[they are going to end up unifying
around this big, beautiful bill]{.underline}]{.mark}** that no one
thinks is really that beautiful **[[because]{.underline}]{.mark}** they
know they have this opportunity to deliver for President
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** and that he **[[is going to demand that
they deliver for him]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Trump's "big bill" will pass now. Trump's push is key.

**Drucker 6-1**-2025, senior correspondent for the Washington Examiner,
where he focuses on Congress, campaigns, and national political trends
(David, "Opinion: The GOP's budget bill will pass in spite of itself,"
*Times Free Press*,
https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2025/jun/01/opinion-the-gops-budget-bill-will-pass-in-spite/)//BB

\"**[[Will it pass]{.underline}]{.mark}**?\" a Republican donor and
occasional source from New York asked me, [[referring
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the sweeping \$2.5 trillion
[[reconciliation]{.underline}]{.mark} package of tax cuts and fresh
spending priorities [[working its way through
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

I\'ve been getting that question a lot lately. Mostly, I hear from
interested political observers who work in business or, like my
donor-source, finance. Either way, they\'re trying to game out future
tax and regulatory policy and figure out the impact on the markets,
their industry, their clients. So, what do I tell them? From the very
beginning, my answer has been the same: \"Eventually, **[[it will
pass]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

Predicting that President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} will [get his Rose
Garden signing ceremony]{.mark}]{.underline} might seem like an easy
call. The bill, aptly dubbed [[the]{.mark} [O]{.mark}ne [Bi]{.mark}g
[B]{.mark}eautiful [B]{.mark}ill [A]{.mark}ct, [cleared]{.mark} [its
first hurdle]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [House]{.mark} of Representatives
[on]{.mark} a [**razor**-**thin**]{.mark}, [party-line]{.mark}
[vote]{.mark} of 215-214]{.underline}. But some political observers,
Republican and otherwise, understandably remain doubtful about its
prospects for final passage.

[In the Senate, where the legislation heads next, there are Republicans
--- including Trump allies --- who oppose key elements of the
bill.]{.underline} Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley doesn\'t like the Medicaid
cuts; Wisconsin\'s Ron Johnson and Kentucky\'s Rand Paul take issue with
the trillions the package is projected to add to a \$37 trillion
national debt, which is already increasing the price of U.S. bonds, and
therefore federal borrowing costs.

Changes made to accommodate these and other Republican senators could
imperil the bill\'s passage. In other words, that Rose Garden signing
ceremony is hardly a fait accompli. Except it is --- and not simply
because, as some GOP lobbyists in Washington rightly emphasize,
[[Trump]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [influential]{.mark} with congressional
Republicans]{.underline}. Of course[, **[the president
matters]{.underline}**]{.mark}. But there are two equally important
factors at play.

### AT Won't Pass\-\--House

#### Senate changes won't derail passage in the House

**Sprunt 6-17**-2025 (Barbara, "Senate Republicans\' changes to \'big
beautiful bill\' tee up clash with House," National Public Radio,
https://www.npr.org/2025/06/17/g-s1-73126/senate-republican-tax-spending)//BB

[[House GOP]{.mark} leaders [narrowly]{.mark} [overcame]{.mark}

the [Senate changes, could threaten the delicate coalition leaders

Both chambers have narrow majorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune
can only lose three GOP senators. Adding to the challenge is Senate
Republicans\' self-imposed deadline to pass the bill by July 4. If the

### AT PC Low

#### Trump's PC is working now

**Mascaro et al 25**, \*AP Chief Congressional Correspondent (Lisa,
Kevin Freking, Leah Askarinam, Joey Cappelletti, 5/21, "As House GOP
grinds ahead, new CBO report says Trump's big tax cuts bill will add to
deficit", PBS,
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/as-house-gop-grinds-ahead-new-cbo-report-says-trumps-big-tax-cuts-bill-will-add-to-deficit)

WASHINGTON (AP) --- [[House Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[p[ushing to vote on]{.underline}]{.mark} [their multi-trillion-dollar
tax breaks [package]{.mark}]{.underline} as soon as Wednesday,
[[grinding]{.underline}]{.mark} out last-minute deal-making
[to]{.underline} shore up wavering GOP support and [[deliver on]{.mark}
President **Donald [Trump's]{.mark} [top legislative
priority]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} himself had [[instructed]{.mark} the
Republican [majority]{.mark} [to quit]{.mark} [arguing]{.mark} [and get
it done]{.mark}]{.underline}, his own **[[political influence on the
line]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But GOP leaders worked late into the night
to convince skeptical Republicans who have problems on several fronts,
including worries that it will pile onto the nation's \$36 trillion
debt.

A fresh analysis from the Congressional Budget Office said the tax
provisions would increase the federal deficit by \$3.8 trillion over the
decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services
would tally \$1 trillion in reduced spending. The lowest-income
households in the U.S. would see their resources drop, while the highest
ones would see a boost, the CBO said.

[[Republicans]{.underline} [hunkered down]{.underline}]{.mark} [at the
Capitol]{.underline} through the night for one last committee hearing
processing changes to the package. Democrats immediately motioned to
adjourn, but the vote failed on party lines.

"President Trump's 'one, big, beautiful bill' is going to require one,
big, beautiful vote," said Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. "We are going to
get this done."

**[[It's]{.mark} a [make-or-break]{.mark} moment [for the
president]{.mark}]{.underline}** and his party in Congress,
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[invested]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[much]{.mark} of their [political capital]{.mark}]{.underline}**
during the crucial first few months of Trump's return to the White House
on this package. If the House Republicans fall in line with the
president, overcoming unified Democratic objections, the package would
next go to the Senate.

The package comes at a daunting time as the U.S. economy faces
uncertainty. Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are
trying to "quickly jam this unpopular legislation through the House
because they know that the longer they wait, the more will come to light
about this cruel and unconscionable bill."

At its core, the sprawling 1,000-plus-page bill is centered on extending
the tax breaks approved during Trump's first term in 2017, while adding
new ones he campaigned on during the 2024 presidential campaign.

To make up for some of the lost revenue, the Republicans are focused on
spending cuts to federal safety net programs and a massive rollback of
green energy tax breaks from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

Additionally, the package tacks on \$350 billion in new spending ---
with about \$150 billion going to the Pentagon, including for the
president's new " Golden Dome" defense shield, and the rest for Trump's
mass deportation and border security agenda.

The package title carries Trump's own words, the " One Big Beautiful
Bill Act."

As Trump promised voters on the tax front, the package proposes there
would be no taxes on tips for certain workers, including those in some
service industries; automobile loan interest; or some overtime pay.

There would also be an increase to the standard income tax deduction, to
\$32,000 for joint filers, and a boost to the child tax credit to
\$2,500. There would be an enhanced deduction, of \$4,000, for seniors
of certain income levels, to help defray taxes on Social Security
income.

To cut spending, the package would impose new work requirements for many
people who receive health care through Medicaid, with able-bodied adults
without dependents needing to fulfill 80 hours a month on a job or in
other community activities.

Similarly, those who receive food stamps through the Supplemental
Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP, would also face new work
requirements.

Older Americans up to age 64, rather than 54, who are able-bodied and
without dependents would need to work or engage in the community
programs for 80 hours a month. Additionally, some parents of children
older than 7 years old would need to fulfill the work requirements;
under current law, the requirement comes after children are 18.

[Republicans said they want to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the
federal programs]{.underline}.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated 8.6 million fewer people
would have health insurance with the various changes to Medicaid and the
Affordable Care Act. It also said 3 million fewer people each month
would have SNAP benefits.

Republicans have been racing to finish up the package by Memorial Day, a
deadline imposed by Johnson as he tries to overcome objections within
his own ranks.

Conservatives are insisting on quicker, steeper cuts to federal programs
to offset the costs of the trillions of dollars in lost tax revenue. GOP
leaders have sped up the start date of the Medicaid work requirements
from 2029 to 2027.

At the same time, more moderate and centrist lawmakers are wary of the
changes to Medicaid that could result in lost health care for their
constituents. Others are worried the phaseout of the renewable energy
tax breaks will impede businesses using them to invest in green energy
projects in many states.

Plus, a core group of lawmakers from New York, California and other
high-tax states want a bigger state and local tax deduction, called
SALT, for their voters back home.

As it stands, the bill would triple what's currently a \$10,000 cap on
the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to \$30,000 for joint
filers with incomes up to \$400,000 a year. They have proposed a
deduction of \$62,000 for single filers and \$124,000 for joint filers.

[[Trump has been pushing hard]{.mark} for Republicans [to unite behind
the bill]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has been uniquely shaped in his
image, and he said after meeting with House lawmakers privately Tuesday
at the Capitol that **[[anyone]{.mark} [who doesn't support]{.mark} the
bill [would be a "fool."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Apologies for this civics lesson, but it's a reminder that this is not

### AT Thumpers

#### Trump's on a [full-court press]{.underline} to secure passage of tax bill -- he's whipping votes

**Andrews & Whalen, 5/20**/2025 (May 20, 2025 9:00 pm ET, Natalie
Andrews and Jeanne Whalen, The Wall Street Journal, "Trump's Economic
Agenda Hinges on Tax Bill That Divides His Own Party; The president is
putting pressure on Republicans to pass the legislation and move past
policy disagreements," https://archive.ph/l0AIM, JMP))

WASHINGTON---President [[Trump's]{.mark} multitrillion-dollar economic
[agenda]{.mark} [hinges]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [fractious GOP
lawmakers]{.mark} [who are at odds]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the
[details]{.mark} of a tax package]{.underline} that could determine
their fate in next year's midterm elections.

Trump is betting that the legislation will win over voters who are
skeptical of his stiff tariffs, which threaten to raise prices for
American consumers. The bill contains versions of his campaign-trail
pledge to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security
benefits, and boosts the child tax credit.

[[The]{.mark} [economic and political stakes are
enormous]{.mark}.]{.underline} If Trump is able to secure passage of his
"big, beautiful bill," he could take credit for delivering tax cuts
ahead of the midterms. If the legislation falters, millions of voters
could instead be focused on the economic fallout from his trade agenda.
On top of that, [many tax cuts put in place during Trump's first term
would expire, triggering tax increases for many]{.underline} U.S.
[households]{.underline}.

[The [president]{.mark} [is **increasingly ratcheting up pressure on
Republicans to fall in line**]{.mark}. "We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in
the Republican Party]{.underline}. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!" Trump
wrote on social media late last week. On Tuesday, [[Trump traveled to
Capitol Hill,]{.mark} [where he echoed that message]{.mark} during a
meeting with House Republicans]{.underline}.

"The bill is do or die. President Trump understands that. That's why
**[[he's on the Hill whipping votes and his]{.mark} [staff is on
full-court press,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** [said]{.underline} Matt
[Whitlock, a former senior Republican Senate aide]{.underline}.

### AT Passage Inevitable

deliver on the mandate from the voters.\"

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a statement:
\"The Congressional Budget Office just confirmed that Donald Trump\'s
Big Beautiful Bill is, in Elon Musk\'s words, a \'disgusting
abomination.\' This independent analysis blows a hole through
Congressional Republicans\' lies---this bill will rip health care away
from millions of people and still jack up the debt to fund trillions in
tax breaks for billionaires and billionaire corporations.\"

President Donald Trump, on Truth Social: \"It\'s time for our friends in
the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\"

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the bill a \"reckless,
regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam,\" and vowed to use it against
Republicans in the upcoming midterm election cycle.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, at a press conference after the bill passed
the House: \"This is a big day. We said on the House floor: It\'s
finally morning in America again.\"

He added: \"Today, the House has passed generational, truly
nation-shaping legislation to reduce spending and permanently lower
taxes for families and job-creators, secure the border, unleash American
energy dominance, restore peace through strength and make government
work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans.\"

What Happens Next

[The [bill]{.mark} is [headed to the Senate]{.mark}, where changes are
expected]{.underline} as legislators aim for a July 4 deadline.
[[The]{.mark} [chamber]{.mark} [has]{.mark} a [53-47 Republican

Manoj Mohanan:

I see. And so [[when you think about Congress]{.underline}]{.mark},
[would [it be fair to think that]{.mark} some of our [northernmost
states]{.mark} or the ones [that are]{.mark} more [active]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} areas [related to minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}, natural
resources, gas, are the ones that [[are more]{.mark} likely to be
[invested]{.mark} [in]{.mark} national policy related to [the

Tim Nichols:

Yeah, very good question. And my students talk a lot about this. [[We
have two senators]{.mark} [and one congressman]{.mark} who are Arctic
related]{.underline}.

Manoj Mohanan:

I see.

Tim Nichols:

[[And then **we have 500 others who are not**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
so while people like me [and folks that are working the natural

of other priorities]{.mark}**. And so [it\'s]{.mark} **[very hard for
the]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited

Manoj Mohanan: I see.

Tim Nichols:

The Russians have 47, the Chinese have more than we do. And so [[it\'s
**difficult domestically**]{.mark} to get the type of resources [to

are **other priorities** in the]{.underline}]{.mark}

what we find\... I think the general assessment is
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a little bit
[[behind]{.mark} because of our democratic construct]{.underline} in

#### Attempts to secure US Arctic leadership [draw down]{.underline} political capital

**Kelley 15**, formerly a Research Associate at the James Martin Center
for Nonproliferation Studies in Washington, D.C., (John-Daniel, "United
States Cannot Lead from Behind in the Arctic," Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/united-states-cannot-lead-from-behind-in-the-arctic/)//BB

Even as [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} celebrates the
beginning of its chairmanship of the Arctic Council, it
**[[hesitates]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.mark} [take
leadership]{.mark} [in the Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline}. This
reluctance highlights a dichotomy between US strategic interests in the
Arctic and that of every other Arctic power which, if not addressed,
increases the likelihood of regional instability.

At a May 21 reception to mark the handover, US Secretary of State John
Kerry said Washington's priorities "include Arctic Ocean safety,
security, and stewardship." He reassured the audience that this is "a
shared responsibility," ensuring that the US role would be one among
many.

When the United States took over the mantle of the Arctic Council from
Canada on April 24, Kerry commented to the press: "Every action that the
Council takes requires collaboration, so we're very grateful to have
partners who are all intent on getting things done." Kerry elaborated on
what US chairmanship for the council would look like: "The theme of our
chairmanship is 'One Arctic' ... which embodies our belief that the
entire world shares a responsibility to protect, to respect, to nurture,
and to promote the region."

[[While]{.mark} some [observers]{.mark} of the United States [in
different global arenas]{.mark} [might be surprised]{.mark} by its
hesitancy to assume more assertive leadership in this region, those
familiar with US Arctic policy are not. Robert Huebert, a political
science professor]{.underline} at the University of Calgary, [echoes the
sentiments of many when he describes [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates as [a]{.mark} "[**reluctant power**" in]{.mark} [the

### L\-\--Science Diplomacy

#### The plan gets portrayed as [wasteful spending]{.underline} that trades off with [domestic priorities]{.underline}

**Hudson 22**, former managing editor of Wall Street Journal Europe
(Richard, "US needs to do better in science diplomacy, White House
says," Science Business,
https://sciencebusiness.net/news/us-needs-do-better-science-diplomacy-white-house-says)//BB
\-\-- sex edited

More specifically, in Lester's view "one of the most important
recommendations in the report" is to study and improve the way the US
attracts and retains foreign science and engineering talent. The report
says foreign-born talent makes up 19% of the US science and engineering
workforce, and contributes 1.7% to 1.9% of US gross domestic product --
but the numbers have been declining since 2014. Other analysts say the
issue gets caught up in the broader immigration dispute between
Republicans and Democrats. This spring, the Biden administration as part
of its Ukraine war response tried to make it easier for Russian
researchers to immigrate -- but Congress stripped the proposed visa
language out of the legislation.

[Since World War II, **[science diplomacy]{.mark}** has been a standard
tool of international relation]{.underline}s -- and [one]{.underline}
largely [invented by the US]{.underline} as its economic and
geopolitical clout increased. By 1960 the US accounted for 70% of global
spending on R&D. Since then, although US public and private R&D budgets
have risen, spending in other countries has risen faster. By 2019, the
report says, [[the US share]{.underline}]{.mark} had
**[[dropped]{.underline}]{.mark}** to 27% if global R&D spending, while
China's share had risen to 22%.

But [[the main problem]{.underline},]{.mark} many analysts say, **[[is
in Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself. [[Very few
Congress\[people]{.mark}\]]{.underline} men [[have any]{.mark} direct
[knowledge of **s**]{.mark}cience **[or]{.mark}**
**[t]{.mark}**echnology. And [for almost all, the main concerns in
annual budget negotiations are **domestic priorities** and
**political**]{.mark} **[sparring]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Congress has
rebuffed]{.underline}]{.mark} [repeated [attempts]{.mark} over the years
[to allocate]{.mark} more [money for international research]{.mark}, or
give agencies more authority to form partnerships]{.underline} --
[[preferring to spend]{.mark} science [money **at home rather than
abroad**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Whatever the reason, in its report the council -- comprised of officials
from across the federal R&D system -- said [formal US
**[gov]{.mark}**ernment [action]{.mark} "generally [has a near-future
focus with few long-term commitments to international S&T." That
means]{.mark} many important **[international]{.mark}**
**[projects]{.mark}** [don't get funded]{.mark}, [or **aren't
prioritised**]{.mark}]{.underline} for their diplomatic importance. [In
the fragmented US science system -- with a gaggle of independent science
agencies each operating on their own -- [there is **little effort** to
coordinate projects with]{.mark}in the government, or with US
[diplomatic objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}, the report said.

#### Foreign policy backlash undermines domestic policy success

**Rogowski 17**, Assistant Professor, Department of Government Harvard
University (Jon, "Bargaining Commitments and Executive Reputation:
Legislative Response to Unilateral Action,"
https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogowski/files/reputation.pdf)

Unilateral Action, Interbranch Bargaining, and the Water's Edge I have
argued that [unilateral action provides information to the legislature
about the president's type and is suggestive of his commitment to the
legislative bargaining process as a means for accomplishing his
goals]{.underline}. The account I have offered largely sidesteps the
question, however, about whether a president's bargaining success in one
policy domain would reflect the exercise of unilateral powers to shape
policy in an altogether unrelated domain. If interbranch bargaining
occurs one-policy-at-a-time, we may not expect a president's use of
unilateral power in one area to affect bargaining outcomes in another.
If, however, unilateral power conveys more general information about the
president's reputation, it may be more likely that a president's actions
in one affect legislative outcomes in another. Nonetheless,
distinguishing whether presidents need anticipate (or fear)
congressional reaction to unilateral action within or across policy
domains is important for characterizing the more general set of
incentives and constraints associated with unilateral power. To address
this question, [[I examine whether a president's use of unilateral
powers **in the foreign policy** arena affects]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[[bargaining success]{.underline}]{.mark} in agencies chiefly concerned
[[with domestic policy.]{.underline}]{.mark} This case provides a
difficult test for evaluating how unilateral action affects bargaining
success across domains. Previous research details a number of ways in
which presidents are more successful realizing their goals in foreign
policy than they are in domestic policy (e.g., Canes-Wrone, Howell and
Lewis 2008), in part because Congress may grant the president greater
deference due to informational advantages that accompany the president's
status as commander-in-chief and because he is well-positioned to
receive intelligence and other classified information that may affect
his decision making (Howell, Jackman and Rogowski 2013). The findings
from this research suggest that foreign policy unilateralism poses a
hard case for detecting its effect on subsequent bargaining outcomes.
From the set of significant executive orders issued between 1945 and
2001, I identified the directives that clearly involved foreign policy.
While the bulk of these directives concerned defense and security, a
number of them concerned other foreign policy issues including trade and
immigration. Altogether, fully half (49.7%) of the significant executive
orders issued during this time period concerned foreign affairs. Using
these data on foreign policy executive orders, I estimate the regression
model shown above for only those agencies that concern domestic policy.
About three-quarters (57) of the 77 agencies in the budget data are
primarily concerned with domestic policy. [[The
results]{.underline}]{.mark} are shown below in Table 2 and [[provide
**clear evidence** that a president's]{.underline}]{.mark} use of
unilateral action to set [[foreign policy have implications
for]{.underline}]{.mark} his [[bargaining success for]{.mark} agencies
concerned with [domestic policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consistent with
the findings in Table 1, the coefficient estimates of β3 are all
strongly negative and statistically significant. Table 2 goes here. The
results from Table 2 confirm and extend the results from the main set of
analyses. [[How presidents wield power has implications for subsequent
success in achieving their legislative goals]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
the nature of these implications dependent upon the presence of the
president's partisan allies in Congress. Somewhat more speculatively,
the findings in Table 2 suggest that [[presidents and Congress **do not
bargain policy area by policy area**; rather, a president's actions in
one policy domain have **implications for the legislative response in
another policy domain**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore, and
consistent with other research on the domestic politics of foreign
policymaking (Howell and Pevehouse 2007; Kriner 2010; Milner and Tingley
2015), [[Congress does not grant the president a blank check when it
comes to setting the country's policies in national
security]{.underline}]{.mark}, defense, and trade. Rather, Congress's
response to unilateral action in the area of foreign policy appears to
be quite similar to its response to unilateral action on purely domestic
policy domains.

### L\-\--Native Adaptation

#### The plan's a political fight in Congress and Alaskan Natives have no political power

GRADUATE DIVISION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I AT MĀNOA IN PARTIAL

//DH

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

Despite calls for government-assisted community relocation in the
literature, participants had doubts about its feasibility. More than
half of all participants (mostly those outside ANVs) discussed this
issue, and they offered reasons why such relocation should or could take
place. But almost half of these participants (again, mostly those
outside ANVs) raised points as to why this relocation might not
occur---namely the expense. As one state official said, "There's a
'should' question---who should? And then there's a 'can' question---who
can? The state government can't. [Legislators from the Lower 48 are not
going to be concerned enough about this issue to appropriate funding to
move a few people in Alaska]{.underline}."

[Lack of political will to proactively address climate change adaptation
for ANVs was the most frequently cited barrier to
adaptation]{.underline} and relocation (noted by several ANV
participants and a number of those outside of ANVs). A number of
participants (mainly outside of ANVs) said that state and [federal
decision-makers]{.underline} either [did not believe in climate
change]{.underline} or did not want to believe in it. A few said that
[these decision-makers would not take any action that could jeopardize
fossil fuel production]{.underline}. [Some referred to legislative
gridlock in Congress, as well as the limited political power of Alaska
compared to more populous states, along with the limited political power
of ANVs compared to the more populated urban regions of
Alaska]{.underline}.

#### No political support exists for greater sovereignty for Alaska Native Villages

IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING "HOW CAN LAWS, INSTITUTIONS, AND PLANS
FACILITATE ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGE ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE?" Proquest
//DH

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

I now turn to the issue of what change would be desirable and feasible
at the ANV level, starting with the question of whether ANVs could get
more jurisdiction over resources needed for adaptation. For the reasons
suggested by participants in favor of increasing ANV jurisdiction as
well as the principle of climate justice, I argue that there should be
more jurisdiction given to tribes of the lands that surround them and
the subsistence resources on which they depend. For example, [there
should be more meaningful subsistence co-management arrangements in
which ANVs have]{.underline} some [authority for decision-making, as
opposed to just consultation]{.underline} on decisions made by agencies
(Richmond 2013; Marine Mammal Commission 2008, p. iv; Meek et al., 2008;
Spaeder 2005, p. 173).

But, as recognized by a number of my participants, [what *should* happen
may not currently be feasible]{.underline}. I found that, particularly
among those outside of ANVs, [there is]{.underline} relatively [limited
support for changing laws to increase ANV jurisdiction.]{.underline} As
I discussed above in the context of a new over-arching law or agency,
[there is a great deal of inertia in the laws that currently control ANV
jurisdiction over land]{.underline} and wildlife management system
(Starkey 2016). For example, [despite nearly five decades of criticism
of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]{.underline}, and some
incremental amendments to adjust it, [a new settlement has not
emerged]{.underline} to take its place (Indian Law and Order Commission
2015, p. 47; Chaffee 2008, p. 129; Berger 1999, p. 105). [ANVs **lack
the political clout** to significantly change the existing
regime]{.underline} (McNeeley 2012, p. 841;

Loring et al., 2011, p. 79; Kofinas et al., 2010, p. 1354).

#### Plan will be accused of creating federal responsibility for climate change

//DH

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

The majority of my participants suggested that creating [a]{.underline}
brand-[new]{.underline} overarching [federal law]{.underline} or agency
[may not be practical, regardless of how much climate change has
impacted ANVs]{.underline} and the need for climate justice. [A new
legal framework would face]{.underline} many challenges, including [the
reluctance of]{.underline} state and [federal government as well as the
public to accept responsibility for climate change]{.underline} (Berke
and Lyles 2013). 14 Even where the need for political change is
acknowledged, [there is little incentive to proactively pay adaptation
costs, especially when future risks are uncertain]{.underline} and
seemingly remote [to those in power]{.underline} (Munck af Rosenschöld
et al., 2014; Berke and Lyles 2013, p. 182; Serrao-Neumann et al., 2013,
p. 441; Moser 2013, 2009; Munaretto and Klostermann 2011, p. 220;
Kofinas and Chapin 2009, p. 72). Absent a disaster that threatens those
with political power, sudden change is unlikely (Boyd et al., 2014;
Garmestani and Benson 2013; Smit and Wandel 2006, p. 289). Congress has
not created anything resembling a new agency since the Department of
Homeland Security, which was fashioned out of existing agencies after
the September 11, 2001 disaster.

### L\-\--Icebreakers

#### Historically, icebreaker funding gets caught up in unrelated political disputes

**Ruskin 18**, Washington, D.C., correspondent for Alaska Public Media.
She covers the state\'s congressional delegation, public lands and
resource development policy from the nation\'s capital, and also from
Anchorage (Liz, "Icebreaker could lose out to border wall in budget
dispute," KTOO,
https://www.ktoo.org/2018/11/29/icebreaker-could-lose-out-to-border-wall-in-budget-dispute/)

President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [in]{.mark} a [stand-off
with]{.mark} [Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}. He said he'll shut down the
government if he doesn't get \$5 billion for border security, and one of
[[his]{.mark} [top]{.mark} [priorities]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [a
wall]{.mark} on the southern border. But [if he gets his way, it
could]{.mark} [mean]{.mark} [Alaska's congressional delegation]{.mark}
[would]{.mark} [lose]{.mark} one of its top priorities: [a polar
icebreaker]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

You may have heard: We've fallen way behind on icebreakers. Russia has
46 now. The United States is down to two that are operational.

And you may have heard Congress has agreed to build more. That's
partially true. Congress approved an icebreaker construction program,
and Congress has put some money into it --- \$150 million here, \$150
million there.

But this year, the Senate went for it.

"\$750 million," Sen. Lisa Murkowski said. "That's what the Senate
looked at and said 'We need this icebreaker. We need to get it going.
That's the commitment. It's one of six, but we've got to get it going."

She wants that money to stay in the final spending package. [But [there
are a lot of moving pieces]{.mark} as [Congress tries to]{.mark}
[negotiate]{.mark} an agreement with the president]{.underline} to keep
the government running beyond the Dec. 7 deadline. Murkowski said the
[[icebreaker money is an **attractive target to lawmakers**]{.mark}
[who]{.mark} [want to end the impasse]{.mark} by spending more on a
border wall]{.underline}.

"[This is the [beauty]{.mark} of the magic of the horror of what goes on
with the process at the end]{.underline}," she said, "**[[is]{.mark}
[where they might find the money]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

The House has agreed to spend \$5 billion, as the president requested.
The problem is the Senate, where Democrats aren't willing to spend that
much --- and where it takes 60 votes to pass a spending bill. The Senate
has approved spending \$1.6 billion for border security.

Murkowski said that could fund a wall, or portions of a wall, between
the border states and Mexico.

"There have been areas that have been identified as good areas within
which you can erect a physical barrier," she said. "There are other
areas --- many, many miles, perhaps hundreds of miles --- that are not
good candidates to spend money on a wall."

[[the president wants a wall]{.mark}, and [icebreakers
**aren't**]{.mark} [**as high** on his priority
list]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### There's zero support for icebreaker expansion

Construction Physics newsletter (Brian, "Why the U.S. Can't Build
Icebreaking Ships," *Construction Physics*,
https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-the-us-cant-build-icebreaking)

[[With icebreakers]{.mark}, [we see a microcosm of]{.mark} the [broader
problems]{.mark} we looked at [in U.S. shipbuilding]{.mark}.
[Icebreakers]{.mark} [are]{.mark} far [more expensive]{.mark} to build
(and take much longer to build) in the U.S. than in foreign shipyards,
and it's only a series of protectionist laws that drive any icebreaker
construction here at all]{.underline}.

[We also see the same cultural issues]{.underline} that we saw with
American shipbuilding more broadly. [[There]{.underline}]{.mark}
seem**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be [[a **lack**]{.mark}
**[of]{.mark} [motivation]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [take]{.mark}
[maritime]{.mark} [issues]{.mark} seriously or treat them as important.
For decades, the U.S. has been willing to accept an undersized
icebreaker fleet]{.underline} -- complaints about insufficient
icebreakers date back to the 1980s. There appears to be little interest
in trying to ameliorate this by acquiring foreign icebreakers, even
though that would be comparatively simple, far cheaper, and far faster.
And [[the Coast Guard]{.mark} apparently [did not think
icebreakers]{.mark} [were]{.mark} [important]{.mark} enough [to select a
team for building]{.mark} them that had icebreaker experience, even
though it's a niche, specialized area of marine
construction]{.underline}.

As a result, **[[icebreaking]{.underline}]{.mark}** can be added to the
list of things [[like]{.mark} [dredging]{.mark} [and offshore]{.mark}
wind turbine installation]{.underline}: areas that have been [[shackled
to America's inefficient shipbuilding industry]{.mark} and]{.underline}
have [inflicted costs on the country]{.underline} in the process.

### AT PC Not Key

#### Political capital is key. House passage proves Trump PC [works]{.underline}, but passage in the Senate isn't guaranteed.

**Lerman & Reilly, 5/22**/2025 (May 22, 2025 at 7:09am, David Lerman and
Caitlin Reilly, "Sweeping budget package passes House after weeks of
arm-twisting; Last-minute lobbying by Trump, key changes to text woo
enough rebellious conservatives,"
https://rollcall.com/2025/05/22/sweeping-budget-package-passes-house-after-weeks-of-arm-twisting/,
JMP))

[House [Republicans]{.mark} [passed]{.mark} their "[big,
beautiful"]{.mark} reconciliation [bill]{.mark}]{.underline} early
Thursday morning, [sending [to]{.mark} the Senate a
[filibuster]{.mark}-proof package [that would
deliver]{.mark}]{.underline} the major elements of President Donald
Trump's legislative agenda, from [[tax cuts]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[border security]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[lifting]{.underline}]{.mark}
the nation's [[borrowing limit]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The]{.mark} 215-214 [vote capped]{.mark} [weeks]{.mark} [of **grueling
negotiations behind the scenes**]{.mark}]{.underline} between House
leaders and warring factions of the Republican conference. While
moderates in high-tax states sought additional tax relief, hardcore
conservatives sought deeper cuts to federal spending, particularly on
Medicaid, and a faster repeal on clean energy tax credits they dubbed
the "green new scam."

A 42-page manager's amendment, released just hours before the final
vote, gave both factions enough of what they wanted to turn undecided
and dissenting lawmakers into supporters of the bill. While more than a
dozen Republicans had threatened to vote down the bill in recent weeks,
almost all agreed to support the final version of the sweeping package.

"Some good, some bad," Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, one of the ringleaders
among rebellious conservatives, said of the manager's amendment before
the vote. "We got some good cuts, but it just still blows a lot of
deficits in the first few years."

Roy helped secure a last-minute fix that would provide \$12 billion to
reimburse states like his for border security costs, even as he was
unsuccessful in cutting funds to states that expanded Medicaid and
currently receive a 90 percent federal match for covering adults without
disabilities. He ultimately voted for the measure.

[[H]{.mark}ouse [F]{.mark}reedom [C]{.mark}aucus Chairman]{.underline}
Andy [Harris]{.underline}, R-Md., [[had been leading
opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} to the previous draft all day Wednesday,
[but **[ultimately]{.mark} [was swayed by some in-person face time with
Trump]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the White House, [[the]{.mark}
[manager's]{.mark} [amendment]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} some
unspecified [[promises of]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[executive]{.mark} [action]{.mark} [to rein in
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"I mean, now it might just be what the executive can do to, again, move
the ball down the court, especially on making sure that we don't have
further Medicaid expansion that is honestly bankrupting my country,"
Harris said before the vote. He ended up voting "present."

No Democrats supported the measure, while two Republicans opposed it:
Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio.

Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., who didn't like last-minute changes in
the manager's amendment that would speed up the expiration of tax
incentives for clean energy projects, was absent for the vote. In a
statement released later, Garbarino explained that he intended to vote
"yes" but didn't make it to the floor in time as Speaker Mike Johnson
gaveled the vote to a close.

Johnson later issued a statement praising Garbarino and his role
negotiating changes to the package that helped shore up support in parts
of the conference, such as an increased state and local tax deduction
cap.

The other Republican who missed the vote, Rep. David Schweikert of
Arizona, also planned to vote for the bill but didn't get the to floor
before the gavel dropped, a spokesperson said.

Big win for Trump, Johnson

Spanning more than 1,000 pages, the legislation would make permanent the
2017 tax cuts, provide new tax breaks such as exempting tips from taxes,
slash federal spending by at least \$1.5 trillion over 10 years, pump an
extra \$300 billion into defense and border security, and raise the
nation's \$36.1 trillion borrowing limit by at least \$4 trillion.

The vote marked the biggest political victory yet for Speaker Mike
Johnson, R-La., who has struggled to unite his razor-thin GOP majority
since winning the speaker's gavel in 2023. A defeat would have been seen
as a major blow to his leadership after promising for weeks to pass the
bill through the House before Memorial Day.

"Sometimes it's good to be underestimated," Johnson told his colleagues
before the final vote. "What we are achieving here today is nothing
short of historic."

The vote was also a victory for **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who
[**[expended some political capital]{.mark} [through]{.mark} [public
and]{.mark} [private cajoling]{.mark}** --- and a visit to the Capitol
Tuesday --- [to rally Republicans]{.mark} around what could be the most
important legislation]{.underline} of his second term.

So much of his agenda was wrapped up in what he called his "one big,
beautiful bill": new and extended tax cuts, a more robust military,
tougher border security measures and a downsizing of government through
major spending cuts.

But [for all the progress, the fate of the bill is hardly secure. The
measure now goes to the Senate]{.underline}, where Republicans have
already made clear they intend to give it a rewrite. Senate GOP tax
writers have suggested they are eyeing more generous tax breaks, while
party moderates in that chamber have expressed concern about the size of
Medicaid cuts.

Advance Trump's Tax Cuts After Late-Night Session"
https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-tax-cuts-senate-votearama-6a5ed924)

[[To get over the finish line, the House and Senate must agree
twice]{.underline}]{.mark}---sometime soon on a budget, then later this
year on a detailed bill. [[They are using a]{.underline} **[fast-track
process]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that allows them [to dodge]{.mark}
the]{.underline} Senate's 60-vote [[filibuster]{.underline}]{.mark}
threshold and pass the bill on simple-majority votes.
[Republicans]{.underline} have a 220-213 House majority and a 53-47
Senate edge, meaning they [can lose only three votes in each
chamber]{.underline} if all Democrats are opposed.

**[[Republicans have stayed]{.mark} mostly [united]{.mark} so
far]{.underline}**. Paul opposed the budget plan because he says a
proposed debt-limit increase tied to the budget plan is too big. His
attempt late Friday to reduce that \$4 trillion or \$5 trillion
debt-limit increase to \$500 billion failed on a 5-94 vote.

[[The House could vote on the Senate's]{.mark} newly passed
[budget]{.mark} as soon as **[next week]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [a step
that would formally kick off]{.underline}]{.mark} months of detailed
[[negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark} on taxes and spending cuts.

[There is]{.underline}, however, [no guarantee]{.underline} the House
and Senate can agree on a budget or again on an ultimate bill, [and [it
may take]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[repeated nudging from
Trump]{.underline}** [to reach a final bill]{.underline}]{.mark} in
what's known as budget reconciliation. Hard-right House conservatives
are balking at endorsing the Senate's minimal spending-cut floors and
higher debt limit.

#### Empirics prove\-\--Trump intervention [can be]{.underline} decisive

**Post 3-29**-2025 (New York Post, "Trump needs to start fighting hard
for his tax cuts, or that Golden Age is a goner,"
https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/opinion/trump-needs-to-start-fighting-hard-for-his-tax-cuts-or-that-golden-age-is-a-goner/)

House Speaker Mike [[Johnson and]{.underline}]{.mark} Senate Majority
Leader John [[Thune]{.mark} are [pushing hard to get that
"big]{.mark}]{.underline}, beautiful [[bill" onto]{.underline}]{.mark}
President Donald [[Trump's]{.underline} [desk]{.underline}]{.mark} [by
the end of April]{.underline} --- but **[[they're going to need him
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** start **[[lead]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
big-time **[[to get it done]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Elements of the bill include 1) renewing and extending the 2017 tax
cuts, 2) raising the federal debt limit, 3) boosting spending on Trump
priorities like border security and 4) cutting billions in spending over
the next decade.

Any one of those is a heavy lift when Republicans have a beyond-narrow
majority in the House, and limited ways of end-running the Senate
filibuster at a time when Democrats' base is pushing to immolate
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for "helping Trump" by preventing a
government shutdown the other week.

Plus, various rules --- for "scoring" tax cuts and spending hikes; for
what's allowed in "reconciliation" measures that can end-run the
filibuster, and so on --- turning the already-complex process of passing
any major bill into something like an Escher blueprint of a Rube
Goldberg machine for the legislative sausage factory.

And [Thune and Johnson must each herd their own very different packs of
cats through the maze]{.underline}.

Just one example: To keep the House Freedom Caucus on board, Johnson's
looking at a plan that cuts far more future federal spending that what
Thune's senators prefer.

Run that disagreement through the perverse "pay for" rules that none of
these Republicans really believe in, and the House ultraconservatives'
obsession could wind up translating into a smaller overall tax cut, or
even an increase in some tax rates above current law.

And never mind that the 2017 tax-rate cuts led immediately to solidly
growing federal revenues and record gains in average wages: Under the
rules, simply keeping those rates unchanged counts as increasing the
federal deficit.

Changing the rules to calculate according to current law, rather thaim
mon the imaginary benefits of stiff tax hikes, is possible --- but
[it'll take a presidential speech or three to bolster moderate
Republican spines]{.underline} against Democrats' fury and the
tut-tutting of the Beltway media.

[[The prez will]{.underline}]{.mark} also likely **[[need to make the
case]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the nation on how GOP Medicaid "cuts" are
all about ending waste, fraud and abuse, from ending the scamming by
rich liberal states like New York and California to ending taxpayer
coverage of border-jumpers' routine health care.

[[Trump]{.mark} has [shown he can]{.mark} make the difference,
**[intervening decisively several times]{.mark}** this year to get key
bills passed]{.underline}, but jumping in at the last minute won't be
enough now.

**[[If he doesn't put major muscle in]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- making
public speeches as well as private phone calls --- **[[the drive can
collapse at any]{.mark} of multiple [point]{.mark}s]{.underline}**.
(Don't forget how an angry Sen. John McCain torpedoed Trump's partial
ObamaCare repeat four years ago.)

[The president is realizing how steep the challenge is]{.underline}:
That's why he regretfully pulled his nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik
to become his (butt-kicking) UN envoy.

**[[If he gives]{.underline}]{.mark}** his **[[maximum attention
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** bolstering **[[the bill]{.underline}]{.mark}**
--- it's his agenda, after all --- **[[it'll get
done]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[If not, it'll fall apart]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [Taxes will
soar]{.underline}, he'll get stuck cutting some rancid deal to avoid
hitting the debt limit, Democrats will be emboldened to stymie the rest
of his agenda --- and **[[the economy will sputter into
recession]{.underline}]{.mark}** ahead of the 2026 midterms.

### AT Issues Compartmentalized

#### Legislative priorities are [zero-sum]{.underline} -- each push trades off with others. 

**Nyhan, 21** - professor of government at Dartmouth College (March 19,
2021, Brendan Nyhan, interviewed by Brooke Gladstone, "Joe Biden and
\"The Green Lantern Theory of The Presidency\""
https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/joe-biden-and-green-lantern-theory-presidency-on-the-media?tab=transcript))

BROOKE GLADSTONE Let me return to David Sirota\'s Guardian piece from
earlier this month for a minute. He actually responded to your Green
Lantern theory formulation by saying, hey, if we adopted your position,
we\'d be succumbing to what he calls the, quote, powerless president
narrative. Is it possible that by invoking the Green Lantern theory,
you\'re basically dismissing criticism of Biden\'s efforts and letting
him or any other president off the hook?

BRENDAN NYHAN I can\'t say that the term or the theory is always applied
in a way I would agree with, and I certainly am not saying that the
Biden administration\'s legislative strategy is perfect. I do question,
though, the assumption that people who are the absolute top of national
politics don\'t know how to get votes and are unable to see how easily
they could win members of Congress or the public to their side. That
seems like a strange preconception to have, and when it\'s offered by
activists with obvious ideological axes to grind, I\'m suspicious. I
certainly can\'t rule it out, but the historical record suggests more
often these claims are at least unsupported and unproven. Again, it
doesn\'t mean the president shouldn\'t try, but these [[constraints are
real]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, Brooke let me just add one more thing:
[[when]{.mark} [people call for]{.mark} the [president]{.mark} [to
try]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} often [fail]{.mark} [to take into account the
**costs of trying**]{.mark}. **[Every]{.mark} [issue]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [is prioritized]{.mark}** by a president [means]{.mark}
[that **other issues don\'t get prioritized**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[Every [legislative]{.mark} [push]{.mark} [in Congress]{.mark}
[means]{.mark} **[another priority doesn\'t]{.mark} get attention**, so
it\'s not just simply a matter of trying.]{.underline} And if you don\'t
try, you don\'t care, [[it\'s a matter of **prioritizing**]{.mark}
**among [many issues]{.mark}** and policies that a president cares
about]{.underline}. In some cases, [the people at the top, [they\'re
**making a calculation about where to allocate their effort and
attention**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [And rather than throw a Hail
Mary on some issue where the chances of success are slim, they\'d rather
focus our attention where they think they have a better
chance.]{.underline}

### AT Trump PC Fake

#### Trump has proven he can [flip votes]{.underline} 

**Ferris & Grayer, 25** (Updated 12:34 PM EDT, Thu April 10, 2025, Sarah
Ferris and Annie Grayer, "House approves key budget blueprint to unlock
Trump's agenda,"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/house-budget-vote-trump-agenda/index.html,
JMP))

House [[Republicans]{.mark} have [taken]{.mark} a [critical step to
advance]{.mark}]{.underline} President Donald [[Trump's tax
cuts]{.underline}]{.mark} and border priorities through Congress, [[a
**major win for party leadership**]{.mark} [after]{.mark}
**[quelling]{.mark} a [conservative rebellion]{.mark}**]{.underline}
over the plan's price tag.

The Thursday morning vote on [[the Senate's]{.mark} budget
[blueprint]{.mark} -- a key initial step in the long budget process --
[will]{.mark} **[eventually allow Republicans to muscle the president's
first big legislative measure over a Democratic
filibuster]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It capped a dramatic week
for Speaker Mike Johnson, who was forced to call off plans for a vote
just hours earlier after nearly 20 Republicans demanded a guarantee of
steep spending cuts.

GOP leaders ultimately convinced them to back the plan for how, punting
bigger -- and more difficult -- fights on spending for the coming weeks.
[It marked a win for Johnson, who has repeatedly relied on Trump to pass
contentious bills that conservatives hate]{.underline}.

The speaker met with the last group of holdouts ahead of the vote
Thursday morning, as he sought to avoid an embarrassing defeat from his
conference. And [**[Trump]{.mark} [applied pressure]{.mark}**,
[promoting]{.mark} his "[b]{.mark}ig, [b]{.mark}eautiful,
[b]{.mark}ill"]{.underline} on Truth Social and **[[making calls
to]{.mark} [lawmakers]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The president celebrated the chamber's move later in the day.

[[Rep]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ralph [[Norman]{.mark} [told]{.mark}
[CNN]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[hearing from
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who had been in close contact with
Johnson, **[[helped to flip his]{.mark} [vote]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"This has evolved over the last 24 hours. You've got the speaker, you've
got the president, you've got \[Senate Majority Leader John\] Thune,"
the South Carolina Republican said.

Asked about the president's promises, Norman said: "He was very
encouraging. We're not gonna have a deficit. We're gonna have \$1.5
\[trillion\] minimum."

Ahead of the vote, [[Johnson]{.mark} and Thune [sought to present a
**united front on how to move forward**]{.mark} on Trump's
agenda]{.underline}. The pair delivered a joint statement aimed at
assuring House conservatives the Senate would back the steep spending
cuts that have been a massive sticking point.

"We are committed to finding at least \$1.5 trillion in savings for the
American people, while also preserving our essential programs," Johnson
said unequivocally.

Thune, meanwhile, said that "our ambition in the Senate is we are
aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined
in terms of savings."

"The speaker's talked about \$1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of
United States senators who believe that is a minimum. And we're
certainly will do everything we can to be as aggressive as possible to
see that we are serious about the matter," he continued.

A number of Republicans wanted to see Thune agree to spending cuts and
Johnson to protecting Medicaid despite those cuts. The question remained
even minutes ahead of the vote whether the leaders' commitments had been
enough.

In a tense floor conversation, the speaker offered assurances to a group
of centrist Republicans that the GOP would protect Medicaid in its
future legislative agenda, according to a person familiar with the
discussion.

Prior to the vote, Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise
huddled with a group of about 10 conservative holdouts in a room just
off the House floor, hoping to get final assurances they had convinced
them to support the blueprint.

[[Following]{.mark} the [talks]{.mark}, Johnson remained optimistic that
[he had **broken**]{.mark} **[through]{.mark} the [logjam after
around-the-clock negotiations]{.mark}**]{.underline} Wednesday. "We got
the votes," he emphatically told reporters as he left the meeting to
head to the floor.

After the vote, [[Johnson]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [other]{.mark}
[House]{.mark} [GOP leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} celebrated their
chamber's adoption of the budget blueprint, but [[acknowledged]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} **[there is a tough road ahead]{.mark}** as Republicans
look to pass a sweeping legislative package]{.underline}.

"That was a big step, because that will allow us now to move forward to
have our committees actually drafting the one big, beautiful bill,"
Johnson said. "There's a lot of work ahead of us, and we're really
excited about that."

**["[Every step of this process is going to be
tough]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We've said this from the very beginning,"
[[Scalise added]{.underline}]{.mark}, telling reporters that "failure is
not an option."

### AT Winner's Win

#### Capital is perceived as finite -- our link's true in practice

**Marshall et al 11**, Bryan W, Miami University BRANDON C. PRINS
University of Tennessee & Howard H. Baker, Jr. Center for Public Policy
Power or Posturing? Policy Availability and Congressional Influence on
U.S. Presidential Decisions to Use Force Presidential Studies Quarterly
41, no. 3 (September)

We argue that the more important effect of Congress occurs because
[presidents anticipate how the use of force may affect the larger
congressional environment in which they inevitably have to
operate]{.underline} (Brulé, Marshall, and Prins 2010). It may be true
that [[presidents consider the chances that Congress will react to a
specific use of force with countervailing tools]{.underline}]{.mark},
but even more importantly [they anticipate the likelihood that [a
foreign conflict may damage]{.mark}]{.underline} (or advantage) [[their
political fortunes elsewhere]{.underline}]{.mark}---in essence, [the
presidential calculus to use force factors in how such actions might
shape their ability to achieve legislative priorities]{.underline}. To
be clear, presidents can and do choose to use force and press for
legislative initiatives in Congress. Taking unilateral actions in
foreign policy does not preclude the president from working the
legislative process on Capitol Hill. However, **[[political capital is
finite so spending resources in one area lessens what the president can
bring to bear in other areas]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That is, presidents
consider the congressional environment in their decision to use force
because their success at promoting policy change in either foreign or
domestic affairs is largely determined by their relationship with
Congress. [[Presidents]{.mark} [do not make such decisions devoid of
calculations regarding congressional preferences]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} behavior or [[how such decisions may influence
their ability to achieve legislative objective]{.underline}s]{.mark}.
This is true in large part because [presidential behavior is motivated
by multiple goals that are intimately tied to Congress]{.underline}.
Presidents place a premium on passing legislative initiatives. The
passage of policy is integral to their goals of reelection and enhancing
their place in history (Canes-Wrone 2001; Moe 1985). Therefore,
presidents seek to build and protect their relationship with Congress.

#### Wins don't spillover\-\--capital is finite\-\--prioritizing issues is key

**Schultz 13** David Schultz is a professor at Hamline University School
of Business, where he teaches classes on privatization and public,
private and nonprofit partnerships. He is the editor of the Journal of
Public Affairs Education (JPAE). "Obama\'s dwindling prospects in a
second term," MinnPost, 1/22,
<http://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2013/01/obamas-dwindling-prospects-second-term>

Four more years for Obama. Now what? What does Barack Obama do in his
second term and what can he accomplish? Simply put, [his options are
limited]{.mark} and the prospects for major success quite limited.
Presidential power is the power to persuade, as Richard Neustadt
famously stated. Many factors determine presidential power and the
ability to influence including personality (as James David Barber
argued), attitude toward power, margin of victory, public support,
support in Congress, and one's sense of narrative or purpose.
Additionally, presidential [power is temporal]{.mark}, often [greatest
when one is first elected,]{.mark} and it is [contextual, affected by
competing items]{.mark} on an agenda. All of these factors affect the
political power or capital of a president. Presidential [power]{.mark}
also [is]{.mark} a [finite and]{.mark} generally [decreasing]{.mark}
product. The first hundred days in office -- so marked forever by FDR's
first 100 in 1933 -- are usually a honeymoon period, during which
presidents often get what they want. FDR gets the first New Deal, Ronald
Reagan gets Kemp-Roth, George Bush in 2001 gets his tax cuts. Presidents
lose political capital, support But, [over time, presidents lose
p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital. [Presidents get distracted]{.mark}
by world and domestic events, they [lose support]{.mark} in Congress or
among the American public, or they turn into lame ducks. This is the
problem Obama now faces. [Obama had]{.mark} a lot of political
[capital]{.mark} when sworn in as president [in]{.mark} 20[09.]{.mark}
He won a decisive victory for change with strong approval ratings and
had majorities in Congress --- with eventually a filibuster margin in
the Senate, when Al Franken finally took office in July. Obama used his
political capital to secure a stimulus bill and then pass the Affordable
Care Act. He eventually got rid of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and secured
many other victories. [But Obama was a lousy salesman, and]{.mark} he
[lost]{.mark} what little [control of Congress]{.mark} that he had in
the 2010 elections.

That [story line]{.mark}, stoked by Republicans but shared by some

to Congress]{.mark}, a legislative naïf who does little to nurture

#### No wins -- negative messaging outweighs

The dominance of negative messaging ensures that politicians ignore wins
and only see losses -- we control the direction of the link

[[Negative messages]{.mark} about political opponents [increasingly
dominate]{.mark}]{.underline} not just election campaigns in the United
States, but [the policymaking process]{.underline} as well. And
[[politics dominated by negative messaging]{.underline}]{.mark} (also
known as blame-generating) [[tends to result in]{.mark} policy
[stalemate]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Negative messaging is
attractive to politicians because [people]{.mark} tend to **[pay more
attention to negative info]{.mark}rmation** than positive information,
[and]{.mark} they **[are more sensitive to losses than]{.mark}
equivalent [gains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Political polarization,
competitive, nationalized elections, increased fiscal stress and changes
in campaign law and practice have all exacerbated pressures to engage in
negative messaging]{.underline} in recent years. There are a number of
strategies that allow politicians to maneuver around the "blame trap"
and avoid policy deadlock in some circumstances, including passing the
buck to non-elected bodies and putting in place triggering mechanisms
that generate politically unpopular policy changes in the future. All of
these strategies have limitations and disadvantages, however, so both
blame-generating politics and policy stalemate are likely to be the "new
normal" in American politics in the near future.

### AT Johnson Key

#### Trump is the key player -- reconciliation vote proves

**Suter, 25** (04/14/25 10:39 AM ET, Tara Suter, "McCarthy says Trump
'having to be' House Speaker and president,"
https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5247711-kevin-mccarthy-trump-speaker/,
JMP))

Former House Speaker Kevin [[McCarthy]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-Calif.)
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} Sunday that President **[[Trump is "having
to be" both Speaker and]{.mark} [president]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"Last week, the so-called fiscal hawks said they'd never vote for what
they just voted for," Fox News's Trey Gowdy said on his show,
referencing the recent adoption of the Senate's framework that will be
used to enact important portions of Trump's legislative agenda by House
Republicans.

["How do you manage a group that rarely takes yes for an
answer?"]{.underline} he added.

McCarthy responded that **[[the "difference is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
President Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

"President [[Trump]{.mark} [brought]{.mark} [them]{.mark} [into the Oval
Office]{.mark}, talked to them, and lo and behold, they were able to
pass the instructions for this reconciliation bill. [Now the hard part
begins, but **you can't give**]{.mark}]{.underline} President
**[[Trump]{.mark} [enough credit]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He's not only
the president, he's now having to be the Speaker and run the House at
the same time," McCarthy said.

Last Thursday, [[House Republicans]{.mark} [adopted]{.mark} a Senate
[framework]{.mark} that will be used to enact important portions [of
Trump's l]{.mark}egislative [agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} via a 216-214
vote. **[[Trump pushed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for [those]{.mark} on the
right flank in Congress [to go]{.mark} [forward]{.mark} with the
legislation]{.underline}.

"It was a good day in the House," House Speaker Mike
[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-La.) [[said]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the wake of the vote. [["I told you not to doubt
us]{.underline}.]{.mark} The media always does. The Democrats always do.
But we get the job done, and we're really grateful to have had the big
victory on the floor just now."

Both Johnson and McCarthy have dealt with heavy pushback from their
caucus in the House while serving as Speaker. Johnson succeeded McCarthy
after the latter was ousted from the Speakership in late 2023, due to
opposition from his fellow House Republicans.

[[remain an important factor in crafting policy agendas]{.mark} and

### IL\-\--TCJA Key to Econ\-\--Delay Bad

#### Only fast passage averts recession risks 

**Cook 3-11**-2025, Bloomberg columnist (Nancy, "Tariff Panic on Wall
Street Pressures Trump to Speed Up Tax Cuts," Bloomberg,
https://archive.ph/CafiW#selection-1181.0-1188.0)

As Donald Trump's [tariffs send markets into a tailspin]{.underline},
[pressure is mounting]{.underline} on the president **[to
speed]{.underline}** up his main proposal for juicing the economy: **[a
sweeping tax bill]{.underline}**.

Trump's team is starting to warn of short-term pain as they pursue a
drastic overhaul of trade and public spending. [Tax cuts]{.underline},
which put more cash in consumer pocketbooks, could help **[soften the
blow]{.underline}**. Allies would ideally like to pass a bill by July,
though there are plenty of hurdles.

In his first term, Trump slashed taxes before beginning a trade war. Now
it's the other way round --- and [the economic backdrop
looks]{.underline} **[shaki]{.underline}**er, [with high interest rates
squeezing the housing market, and inflation proving sticky]{.underline}.
Above all, his second-term tariffs are both steeper and less
predictable, as the on-again, off-again levies imposed on Canada and
Mexico showed.

[All of this is driving a slump on stock markets]{.underline}, which
Trump has always viewed as a barometer, **[and triggering]{.underline}**
talk of **[recession]{.underline}** risks. [Tax cuts could
**revive**]{.underline} animal **[spirits]{.underline}**, like they did
in 2017, though Democrats say they will chiefly benefit the wealthy.

The president is also betting that signing a major bill into law in the
Rose Garden will help Republicans keep control of the House in the 2026
mid-term elections. But [with investors and consumers getting anxious,
the administration may **need it to happen fast**]{.underline}.

'On Different Pages'

Steve Moore, an informal economic adviser to Trump, wants an even faster
timetable than the July target, calling for a bill to be signed by
Memorial Day in late May. Moore, who isn't entirely aligned with Trump's
views on the efficacy of tariffs, points to above-target
**[inflation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[weak home sales
as]{.underline}** [signals of a potential slowdown]{.underline}.

"[The economy needs a pick-me-up]{.underline}," Moore says. "[Tariffs
are not a pick-me-up, but tax reform is]{.underline}."

#### Speedy passage is key to prevent oncoming economic collapse

"Trying to move quick on tax cuts," Politico,
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-tax/2025/03/31/trying-to-move-quick-on-tax-cuts-00260045)

Here's **[a]{.underline}**nother [reason]{.underline} for Republicans
[to [**move quickly** on tax cuts]{.mark}]{.underline} this year ---
they need **[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** try to [[calm]{.mark} people
[skittish]{.mark} about the [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

President Donald Trump is set to levy wide-ranging tariffs in a couple
days. In fact, outside experts are commenting that the kinds of revenues
that Trump's advisers are expecting to get from tariffs are
inconceivable.

At the same time, recent polling has shown [voters becoming skeptical of
Trump's work on the economy and giving him increasing blame for
inflation]{.underline}, even as the country appears evenly divided on
his overall job performance.

With all that swirling around, Kevin Hassett, the director of the
National Economic Council, plugged the **[[tax
cuts]{.underline}]{.mark}** that Republicans
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** trying to get [across the finish
line]{.underline} as [**[key]{.underline}** **[in blunting the impact
of]{.underline}**]{.mark} any **[[disruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
might happen **[[because of]{.underline}]{.mark}** Trump's
**[[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) hit a similar note on
Friday, after the government's primary inflation measure came in a bit
hotter than expected.

"[[Congress can kickstart the]{.mark} second Trump **[economic
boom]{.mark}** [with policies that]{.mark} will [boost paychecks, cut
taxes]{.mark} for wage earners, [and bring investment]{.mark} to all

Changes in Trump's Second Term," *WISS*,

Trump's Promises on Taxes

During his campaign, Trump hinted at several significant adjustments to
the tax code. These included cutting tax rates for middle-class
Americans, introducing new incentives for businesses, and even
advocating for potential tax breaks to support domestic manufacturing.
His rhetoric often complemented his broader economic strategy, which
included imposing tariffs to protect American industries and reducing
regulatory burdens on businesses. This makes it clear that [[Trump's tax
policies]{.mark} will]{.underline} likely aim to **[[stimulate]{.mark}
economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** while aligning with his "America
First" agenda.

[An early look at the priorities of the newly inaugurated administration
suggests a **strong focus** on [reducing corporate
taxes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump has long maintained that [a
competitive corporate tax rate [is essential]{.mark} for keeping
American [businesses thriving, particularly as they face]{.mark} the
challenges of global industries and [rising trade
tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Individual taxpayers, however, may see
relief too. Trump has floated the idea of expanding tax cuts for the
middle class --- potentially a continuation of the benefits introduced
under his first term's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Potential Impacts on Businesses

[[For businesses, reduced taxation]{.mark} could [lead to **considerable
benefits**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Lower corporate tax rates and tax
credits for manufacturing firms could [drive reinvestment in
U.S]{.mark}.-based [production]{.mark} and jobs]{.underline}. Such
policies complement increased tariffs on foreign goods, creating a more
protectionist economic environment. However, these measures are not
without controversy. Critics argue that while businesses may benefit in
the short term, tariffs, and tax policies could push consumer prices
higher.

However, renewable energy and technology businesses are gearing up for
uncertainty. For example, Trump's skepticism toward clean energy
subsidies indicates that the tax benefits associated with green
industries might face cuts. This could redirect investment away from
wind, solar, and electric vehicle manufacturing innovations.

For Individual Taxpayers: Hope for Middle-Class Relief

[[Middle-class Americans]{.mark} may [find some optimism in Trump's tax
pledges]{.mark}]{.underline}. Building on the foundation of his first
term, [the administration could aim to simplify tax filing for
individuals, expand deductions, or [introduce further tax
cuts]{.mark}]{.underline} targeted at the average worker. [[These
measures would address economic concerns for millions]{.mark} of
households]{.underline} and bolster Trump's focus on working-class
voters. This group has been key to his political base.

Yet, the extent to which these changes will materialize remains a
question of timing. [Crafting tax legislation is a slow
process]{.underline}, and [any [major overhauls]{.mark} will
[need]{.mark} to undergo months **[of debate and compromise]{.mark}** in
Congress]{.underline}. With a divided legislature likely, [the outcome
is far from certain]{.underline}. [[Trump's ability to shepherd his
**ambitious tax plans** through Congress will be a **true test of his
political capital**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### 1 trillion in GPD is on the line

**Silver 24**, President and Owner of Ketchie, Inc. (Testimony of
Courtney Silver President and Owner of Ketchie, Inc. U.S. House of
Representatives Committee on Ways and Means "The Need to Make Permanent
the Trump Tax Cuts for Working Families" January 14, 2025, Lexis)

[The study examines the [economic consequences of]{.mark} the
[expiration of the TCJA's]{.mark} pro-manufacturing
[provisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, [the economic fallout
from the loss of these provisions [is
**staggering**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If [Congress fails to act,]{.mark}
5.9 million jobs,]{.underline} \$540 billion in employee compensation
**[and \$[1.1 trillion in U.S. GDP are on the
line]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The manufacturing sector is
disproportionately impacted]{.underline} by these expirations. In our
sector alone, 1.14 million manufacturing jobs will be at risk,
potentially impacting \$126 billion in manufacturing worker compensation
and \$284 billion in manufacturing output.4

[The solution to prevent this **[economic devastation]{.mark}** is
simple]{.underline}: Congress must make permanent crucial
pro-manufacturing tax provisions from **[the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act]{.underline}**. Specifically, [[Congress
should]{.underline}]{.mark}:

• [**[Protect small businesses]{.mark}** by]{.underline}:

> o Preserving the pass-through deduction;
>
> o Preventing individual income tax increases; and
>
> o Safeguarding family-owned businesses from the estate tax;

• [[Support **innovation**]{.mark} **and investment**]{.underline} by:

> o Restoring immediate R&D expensing;
>
> o Reviving full expensing for capital investments; and
>
> o Reinstating a pro-growth interest deductibility standard; and

• **[Enhance American [competitiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}** by:

> o Preserving the FDII deduction;
>
> o Preventing an increase in the minimum GILTI rate; and
>
> o Preventing the BEAT rate from increasing.

Additionally, though the 21% corporate tax rate is not set to expire,
Congress should remain vigilant against any calls to increase taxes on
manufacturers by raising the corporate rate given its impact on
businesses throughout our industry---including smaller companies like
Ketchie that do not pay tax at the corporate rate but that rely on
larger businesses in our supply chain that do. [Congress has the
opportunity [to preserve]{.mark} all of [these]{.mark} vital
[provisions]{.mark} from the Trump tax cuts--- and, in the process, to
[preserve]{.mark} nearly [**6 million** U.S. jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons and House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) wrote in a recent op-ed for the Washington

What's going on: "The choice is clear. **[[Congress]{.mark}

expanding [Trump's]{.mark} [pro]{.mark}-[growth]{.mark} [tax]{.mark}
[policies]{.mark}, which have worked so well]{.underline}."

[The [reforms]{.mark} allowed manufacturers "to hire, expand and invest

with a particularly positive effect on small and medium-sized
businesses]{.underline}.

Georgia-based Winton Machine Company, which produces machinery used in
tubular parts and coaxial cable fabrication, would not have been able to
expand its workforce, raise employee pay or purchase critical technology
had it not been for the TCJA, as Winton CEO and Co-Owner and NAM board
member Lisa Winton told Congress in 2023.

Austin Ramirez, president and CEO of hydraulic and electromechanical
control systems maker Husco in Wisconsin and NAM Executive Committee
member, told legislators that tax reform allowed his family-owned
company "to create jobs, expand research and development, compete
globally and invest in its future, including the most significant
renovation of his business in 70 years," Timmons and Chairman Smith
wrote.

What's at stake: "Key provisions of the 2017 Trump tax reforms have
already expired, and many more are set to lapse later this year,"
Timmons and Chairman Smith continued.

"[[Without]{.mark} **[swift]{.mark}** [action]{.mark},
[manufacturers]{.mark} [will]{.mark} **[miss]{.mark} [out]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} tax [incentives]{.mark} for research and development and
equipment purchases, while small businesses and family-owned
manufacturers will see their tax rate double to as high as 43.4%---all
at a time [when]{.mark} **[global]{.mark} [competition]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [intensifying]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

According to a recent NAM study cited in the op-ed, [if Congress fails
to preserve tax reform by the end of this year]{.underline}:

> **[[Nearly 6 million U.S. jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}**---more than 1
> million of them in manufacturing---**[[will]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
> [lost]{.mark}]{.underline}**; and

What must be done: **[[Congress]{.mark} [must]{.mark} [act]{.mark}
[now]{.mark}]{.underline}** to restore the pro-manufacturing tax
provisions that have already sunset and make permanent those that are
scheduled to expire, Timmons and Chairman Smith concluded.

The Value of Small Businesses to Their Communities

[[Small]{.mark} [businesses]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[heartbeat]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} their communities, creating
jobs, fostering local [[economic]{.mark} [growth]{.mark}]{.underline},
and contributing to the unique character of the neighborhoods they
serve. Family and privately-owned and operated businesses often
prioritize long-term relationships with their customers, employees, and
suppliers, which helps build a sense of trust and belonging. These
businesses sponsor local events, contribute to charities, and act as
community hubs where neighbors come together. [Unlike most multinational
corporations, small businesses are deeply rooted in the communities they
serve, and their success is intertwined with the well-being of their
local areas]{.underline}.

When small and family-owned businesses are bought out by larger
multinational corporations, communities lose more than just a
storefront. Decision-making shifts from local owners who understand and
care about their neighbors to distant corporate C-suite executives,
whose priorities often center on maximizing shareholder profits at the
expense of local jobs. This disconnect can result in layoffs, reduced
local investment, and diminished community involvement. Losing these
small businesses erodes the fabric of local economies and culture,
leaving behind impersonal enterprises that fail to address the unique
needs of the communities they occupy. [[Protecting]{.mark} [small
businesses is]{.mark}]{.underline} not just **[[an]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark} [imperative]{.mark}]{.underline}** but a cultural one,
essential to preserving the identity and vibrancy of communities across
America.

Conclusion

[The [Tax]{.mark} [Cuts]{.mark} and Jobs Act [has]{.mark} [been]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} **[lifeline for small businesses]{.mark}**, multigenerational
family enterprises, and working families]{.underline}.
[Provisions]{.underline} like the 199A deduction, full bonus
depreciation, lower marginal tax rates, doubling the standard deduction,
increasing the AMT exemption, the expanded the child tax credit, the
increased estate tax exemption [have enabled hard-working Americans to
thrive, invest, and contribute to their communities]{.underline}.

As someone who works closely with these individuals and businesses, [I
have seen the tangible benefits of the TCJA and understand the risks of
letting these provisions expire. I urge Congress to]{.underline}
permanently **[[extend]{.mark} [these]{.mark}
[provisions]{.mark}]{.underline}** quickly and
**[[swiftly]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well as consider further reforms,
such as the repeal of the estate tax, to support our main street
businesses that are the backbone of our economy. [[Small]{.mark}
[businesses]{.mark} and family enterprises **[deserve]{.mark}**
[a]{.mark} [tax]{.mark} [code]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [is]{.mark}

**[members]{.underline}** on both sides of the aisle **[worked together
to solve the problem]{.underline}**. [You held dozens of hearings,
created bipartisan working groups and accepted thousands of public
comments on what the next generation of the tax code should look
like]{.underline}. [Policy solutions with strong bipartisan
support]{.underline}---such as the need to lower our corporate tax rate,
ensure fair treatment for small businesses, provide relief to families
and update our international tax system---[became the bedrock of what
would become the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]{.underline}.

**[[Manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark}** spent years calling for
Congress to fix our outdated tax code: our industry **[[was facing
significant headwinds]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and we said that [if
Congress could give us the economic tools required to right the ship, we
would do so. I am proud to say that **[manufacturers]{.mark}** across
the country **[kept our promises]{.mark}**. In 2018, the [year]{.mark}
after [tax reform was signed]{.mark} into law, [manufacturing
experienced the best year for job creation]{.mark} in 21 years
[and]{.mark} the best year for **[wage]{.mark}** growth in 15

used]{.mark}]{.underline} the pro-growth provisions from [[tax reform to
grow]{.mark} our businesses, [purchase]{.mark} new capital
[equipment]{.mark}, create jobs, [add]{.mark} new [benefits]{.mark} for
employees **[and invest]{.mark}** in our communities. The evidence is

### IL\-\--TCJA Extension Key to Innovation

#### Failure collapses the innovative economy 

**Weisenthal** and Brady **24**, host of Odd Lots Podcast, American
politician who served as the U.S. representative for Texas\'s 8th
congressional district from 1997 to 2023 (Joe and Kevin, "The Big Tax
Hike Coming in Just Over a Year," Odd Lots Podcast, Transcribed by
Otter.ai and Brett Bricker)

e realized especially [in 2017 we had to go bold]{.underline} because we
only get this only happens as you said Joe once every once a generation
really and so you can\'t miss that opportunity the other thing we
learned is the Bolder you go the more people are willing to give up
parts of the old tax code to [to drive a new modern faster better
performing]{.underline} [tax vehicle]{.underline} going forward so we
took lessons we\'d learned in the into the whole tax debate I want to
get in obviously to some of the philosophical questions and about the
questions of what a progrowth tax system looks like but before we do why
don\'t you just lay out the sort of bullet point versions of What the
[[TCJA]{.underline}]{.mark} did and then what specifically is set to
**[[expire]{.underline}]{.mark}** and would revert to in the next few
years because I know not some of it is actually permanent like the
corporate side is not going to change but why don\'t you just sort of
give us the bullet points from 2017 and what **[[could
reverse]{.underline}]{.mark}** yeah so it is different 2025 than it was
in 2017 so [we]{.underline} really the focus [had to begin with
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline} you know [because [our economy was **so
slow** and competitiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} because we [[had fallen
**so far behind**]{.underline}]{.mark} so that\'s why Focus was on
dramatically reducing the corporate tax rate because to 21 to 21 which
really put us **[[we were dead last]{.underline}]{.mark}** we moved into
the middle of the pack but [the redesign]{.underline} of the
international code [made us very very competitive]{.underline} and so
21% puts us in the middle of the pack for our major foreign competitors
uh at 21% we could have gone long uh lower in that regard in fact
president Trump wanted to go lower there but what we thought that would
perform very well and it did we lower taxes on individuals across the
board our taxes are high they had been growing since the Reagan tax cuts
and so our job was we believed if you give families workers and small
businesses you know more control over their earnings one you know they
get to leave live their dream not the government\'s dream and the
economy is going to grow and so we did some big things I think on the
middle class uh tax cuts we created the first ever small business tax
deduction 20% for those what we call passers those are the non-c
corporations where the money gets paid by the individuals you reduced
the amount of state and local taxes that I can write off on my tax thank
you you\'re welcome uh happy to get out of New York as fast as I can but
yeah but can we talk about Sol minute because yeah it\'s hard to ignore
it a lot of our listeners are very interested in salt I think I know so
I should have come in under an assumed name but you couldn\'t ignore
salt it is the biggest single subsidy I think within the individual tax
code it\'s worth a trillion two trillion five and we needed those
dollars to pay for the small for the middle class tax cuts for the most
part but here\'s what we did so we took a look at it wasn\'t a red blue
thing at all in fact Texas is one of the bigger users of The Salted
because of our property tax property tax.

So what we looked at and we realized you know everyone\'s subsidizing
everyone you know rural community cities low and modest income higher
income non itemizers itemizers and so we arrived at a simple pre premise
which is why doesn\'t everyone just pay their own state and local taxes
I mean we choose where we work and we live we have a choice in our
elected officials why is anyone obligated to help us pay more
importantly why are we obligated to help pay others because half the
salt deduction goes to households making a million dollars or more so
what we did was and then use that money to lower rates across the board
so take a deduction from some give it to to many more at the end though
you know we compromised talking with the legislators uh in high tax
states you know was really important we preserve some of it so we took
the standard average standard deduction Across America which was 5,000
and we doubled it but then we didn\'t stop there so we took the child
tax credit which was sort of limited about 120,000 we took it up to
400,000 to provide more tax relief for people who were impacted by salt.

We did away with the AMT Alternative Minimum Tax again that\'s what how
people couldn\'t get like in New York New Jersey couldn\'t even use the
salt tax deduction even though in place then we changed the marginal tax
rates all to make we want lower taxes in every state not red States not
just every state and so we made big changes to make sure we saw those
tax cuts and I know most people look at it and say look we just need to
restore that and I wouldn\'t be surprised if there\'s some give on that
because we\'ve got we\'ve got in our party as well you know we\'ve got
New Yorkers and New Jersey and California Illinois you know Minnesota So
Long Island Republicans getting a little yeah so look that that\'s fair
it\'s important to them and so I think there\'s there\'s some pretty
good discussions I I think you might see some relief but but here\'s the
warning it\'s really expensive yeah and every dollar comes out of those
middle class tax cuts so whatever you give there you know you got to
figure out where to pick it up somewhere else yeah plenty of people
still feel salty about salt myself included full disclosure okay this
reminds me though one thing I always wanted to ask about these is did
you have a particular tax model in mind when you started this process
did you look at potentially other countries and say they\'re doing this
right or they\'re doing this wrong or is it the case that because of the
uniqueness of the US tax system there are no International comparisons
that you can really make there are tons of international comparisons we
spend a lot of time both the way they tax businesses that compete around
the world and the way they tax themselves and and obviously we\'re out
of Step especially on the international side no no very few other
countries taxed you at home and taxed your business abroad they taxed
you at home but we we were doing both and it was a problem a lot of a
lot of countries have value added taxes you know that that add more
revenue on beyond their income taxes we\'re well aware of that but I\'m
going to tell you what was driving this as a model and you\'re going to
laugh at first but let me explain it to you so and why we did it so you
heard us talk about getting 90% of Americans to be able to file on the
back of a postcard and you probably said that is a political gimmick but
in fact that was driving our goal of simplifying the tax code
dramatically so getting rid of a lot of that complexity for some
lowering the rates for everybody and creating more fairness and
understanding of how we tax people and our thinking was look for again
there\'s there\'s there\'s people who would never be able to do that but
for a lot of Americans.

You know there is something powerful about looking at 13 lines and
saying this is how I\'m taxed and almost all the Neighbors in that I can
see this is how they\'re taxed too and it also makes it harder for
Washington to raise taxes because you actually know you know what I mean
how you are being taxed so the postcard drove what we hoped would be
Simplicity fairness obviously stronger growth as well uh and on the
business side you know our first proposal which didn\'t make it all the
way through was to basically eliminate huge chunks of the international
code and replace it with a border adjustment tax which is basically a
consumption tax that asks a simple question do you sell your product or
service in America if so everyone\'s paying the same rate doesn\'t
matter where it was made doesn\'t matter where it was shipped from
doesn\'t matter who did it are you selling it here if so if you\'re us
or you\'re from France you\'re paying the same rate and so we thought
one and and and the the other big virtue of it is that for American
companies you took that tax off of uh products you\'re exporting and
selling you put it on those coming in so now we\'re more competitive
compared to the vat around the world in in the Simplicity of it it was
bold uh I still think it\'s you know in an incredibly positive approach
on taxes but we had a short Runway to get all this done.

You know industries that that that import a lot whether you\'re a
Walmart or refiner or an apple or whatever you know they have real
objections to it we didn\'t have time to be able to sit through and work
and so at one point we had to jettison what was one of the Bolder I
think more positive things but that\'s the process you know Tracy you
were asking about it\'s you still [no matter what your
dreams]{.underline} are [**[you got to get it through]{.mark}**
Congress]{.underline} so tell us more about that process what are the
conversations actually like are you all in a room together like yelling
at each other are there uh you know phone calls at midnight that kind of
thing so because we started so early you know it was just a continual
series of meetings listening sessions discussions with with the
scorekeepers like joint [**[committee]{.mark}** on taxation]{.underline}
Congressional budget ask you about that yeah [**[you got to
figure]{.underline}** **[out]{.underline}** **[how to turn the Rubik\'s
Cube]{.underline}**]{.mark} to figure out okay if we do this and this
what do you get like what kind of growth and and who pays the taxes and
what\'s the cost of all that and so we had a long time to run through
countless meetings briefings bringing experts and all that but in 2017
as **[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}** really
**[[start]{.mark}ed]{.underline}** to get crunch time all of that
accelerated and so we **[certainly [in]{.mark} the
[House]{.mark}]{.underline}** we started with this premise we went to
our house members and said look we\'re going to tear the tax code down
to its foundation and we\'re going to rebuild it so go back home and
listen to what people what\'s important in in 2017 not not the 1980s
like what is important to you and then we rebuilt it from that and so
**[[lots]{.mark} and lots [of meetings]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[lot of
listening sessions [late into the night]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[we
had]{.underline}** the **[[Ways and Means]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Committee members **[[working we brought them back for holidays]{.mark}
you know had them work [when everyone was on
recess]{.mark}]{.underline}** a lot of it was [listening]{.underline}
because to [to]{.underline} other members and [briefing
groups]{.underline} from DC and around the country even though we
didn\'t get Democrat support you know I briefed our ways and means
Democrats our new Democrats our problem solvers **[the trade
union]{.underline}** **[sat down with them]{.underline}** we knew I knew
they weren\'t going to be able to support this but [I wanted to hear
what was important]{.underline} to them to figure out what might be the
bipartisan areas that we can design to and [it was all [that was]{.mark}
[hugely helpful]{.mark} but the process you\'re working]{.underline}
**[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Senate the White House constant
**[[media]{.underline}]{.mark}** presence lots of **[groups
[attacking]{.mark}]{.underline}** or supporting [[it\'s]{.mark} sort of
[a **hurricane**]{.mark}]{.underline} you know what I mean of input as
you\'re doing \[Music\]

\[Music\] that I\'m going to ask you a kind of political question you
can be as forthcoming as you would like to be on this question but
there\'s obviously a possibility that you know **[Trump]{.underline}**
wins in November and he says things in the media that I think probably
people in DC like Wonder like how serious [is]{.underline} he so you
know like and some things he says seem like [quite bold]{.underline} you
know he says he\'s talked on the campaign Trail this time no taxes on
tipped income I think he said last night we\'re recording this September
26 he\'s like no we\'re just not going to tax us manufacturers he saids
some things that are more make economists very nervous such as massively
inreasing uh tariffs which are attacks and he says things that make
people even more heads scratch such as oh maybe we could create a \$35
trillion cryptocoin and pay off the deficit.

So what I want to ask you is from the perspective of a uh someone
writing policy how should people think about what he says publicly and
translating this or taking it seriously how seriously should we take you
why don\'t you tell us how we should interpret and then how these things
maybe get molded into something real having an experience working with
the president both on healthare a tax reform and in trade to some degree
so the every day the press in in on the capital would ask me about the
president\'s latest tweet always did but I didn\'t pay attention to his
tweets I paid attention to his campaign promises because [I\'ve never
seen]{.underline} some of [the White House so focused on
this]{.underline} is what I said we do have you done it yet because it
matters to him but the flip side of that was you know he was not wed to
doing exactly that so my advice always is take him seriously but not
literally because uh whether you\'re working on taxes or trade whatever
man he\'s opened lots of changes he\'s listening to sort of that Team of
Rivals discussion you can shape and we did in tax from shape a lot of
what were campaign promises into positive things but not exact I just
well follow up on this one thing that he does not if a future Trump
presidency does not really need the help of Congress on would be teror
yeah and he\'s talk he he he to your point he followed through with his
otter promises from the 2016 election and in the 2024 election he has
much bigger uh tariff promises and I have to imagine that you know a lot
of people particularly in DC who are like deeply uncomfortable about
this particularly corporate anyone who trades International Etc how\'s
you what are you telling them about the risk of a very different
international trading regime under the next president yeah so I\'m I\'m
not a f fan of tariffs I think they\'re incredibly damaging you punishes
America more than whoever we\'re trying to punish and and yeah it it is
I I don\'t advise any president to go that route unless there is some
very specific Target you need to hit but what I advise them in using the
experience of of his first term is same thing take him he\'s going to
use tariffs for a purpose if not imposing them sort of hammering people
into to coming to the table on issues he I think that\'s he uses that
threat uh fairly effectively it is disruptive I did have an impact on
economic growth there\'s no question both the threat of withdrawing from
NAFTA for example the major threats were the steel aluminum filed
through on in China there\'s no question uh it slowed growth and and had
an impact and so would future tariffs and my advice is again take him
seriously he likes tariffs believes that levels the playing field and
he\'s held that belief andc aties but that uh he also listens to the
economic impact you know he\'s proud of his economy and he\'s open to
arguments of how this hurts the very people he\'s trying to help since
you mentioned economic growth how do you judge the success of something
like the tax cuts because you know I\'m aware there\'s a controversy
right now over Dynamic analysis or or modeling and it **[it does seem
hard to disentangle]{.underline}** the **[cuts from other
factors]{.underline}**.

So I\'m and it does feel like you know you can kind of say like oh well
the tax cuts did this but then you can argue well there were other
things going on and that\'s why growth went up so [how do you kind of
evaluate the actual impact]{.underline} yeah as you know there\'s lots
of projections ahead of tax reform in the economy there\'s lots of
different data on it we try we try to use the government data as much as
possible you know and we supplement it with lots of other studies and
different groups those are all very helpful but we tend to rely on so
what do the numbers show us and yes there are always other factors I
think the relief on regulation played a pretty important part I think in
the economy over overall and you just have **[the [econ]{.mark}omy [in
general]{.mark}]{.underline}** so uh we were always taking a look at how
much did it grow jobs how much money returned from overseas 2 and a half
trillion you know we had **[[Innovations]{.underline}]{.mark}** to do
your **[[i]{.mark}ntellectual]{.underline}**
**[[p]{.mark}roperty]{.underline}** in America or bring it back those
revenues doubled really good outcome there um [investment]{.underline}
from businesses big thing that drives that drives equipment that drives
all this stuff on average [[went up 20%]{.mark}]{.underline} really good
numbers uh [research did the exact same thing and so watching the
economic data we were achieving much of what we]{.underline} uh uh had
[hoped for]{.underline} the one the one element I 2019 to me was the
most fascinating year we watched it closely because the code had been in
place one year now we could sort of see how it was working and we know
generally how an individual like a corporate rate cut or research and
develop how it will perform generally but the question is how does it
all interact you know what I mean like how does that it\'s like a
Formula 1 car you bring an upgrade how does it affect the rest of the
performance and so that\'s what I was following 2019 couple key things
happened I think besides very strong economic growth one real wages I\'m
like ahe of inflation grew more in one year than in the eight years
combined before it [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} fact those first [[three
years after TCJA]{.mark} real wages average 9% that\'s [the **best three
years on record**]{.mark}]{.underline} so paychecks are growing check
the box that was working really well **[[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}**
you know 2019 just **[[plummeted]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a good way
but it it it did the most made the most progress among the people who\'d
sort of been left behind people of color those without a high school
degree disabled Young Folks got new opportunities that was that was what
we were driving for and then income inequality began to shrink for the
first time in 50 years according to lar Larry Lindsay fed governor and
and in the White House economic team, another goal of ours.

yeah we were every year uh tracking what progress we\'re making and what
Provisions might not be performing as well as you want you mentioned
income inequality I\'m curious your philosophy about the the role of
progressivity in the tax code so we obviously have a progressive income
tax and the more you make the higher percentage of your marginal uh you
know higher marginal tax goes up a criticism that you get of tax cuts is
like well a lot of the tax cuts benefit the rich but of course the rich
pay a lot of taxes so if you\'re uh relative to the poor so if you\'re
going to cut taxes we all know like on net where those dollars are going
to flow but just talk to us about your philosophy of the role that the
tax code can play in the tcga or just generally and thinking about the
importance or unimportance if uh if that\'s your view of progressivity
in the tax code yeah so **[I don\'t think people realize how Progressive
our code is compared to other countries]{.underline}** if you just look
at like what is the top rate you might say well it\'s more in France or
somewhere else but if you look at what\'s the share of taxes that each
income group pays we are incredibly Progressive and [the top 1% in
America today shoulder about 45% of all the income tax
burden]{.underline} that\'s that\'s unusually high for it in in the
converse is true as well like [the bottom half of income earners what we
would think is up to the middle class shoulder only about a little more
than 2% of the whole income tax burden]{.underline} so in in it grew
after the tax reform it grew a quarter for the for the wealthy they they
picked up a bigger burden it shrunk by a quarter for the modest and low
income down to 2.3% so we are people are always surprised how
Progressive we are compared to other countries real quickly and before
we forget to do this can you give us the bullet point summary of what
happened okay let\'s say 20 uh 20 election 2024 election happens it\'s
political gridlock they can agree on nothing in DC what reverts and what
doesn\'t yeah so 2017 was all about growth competitiveness 2025 is going
to be about the individual tax cuts do do they hang around and so all
all the individual marginal rates uh revert back to pre 20107 those are
an average family for it\'s going to be around \$2,000 roughly um things
like the child tax credit is going to shrink back the standard deduction
which we nearly doubled hugely popular and now 90% of Americans don\'t
have to itemize their taxes they sort of love that that reverts as well
uh the small business tax cuts we created goes away that\'s really
damaging I think in a big way then things like the the estate tax we
call the death tax Family Farms and businesses goes back to to very few
exceptions in a much higher rate things like opportunity zones disappear
uh the new we created a new child or tax credit for paid family and
medical leave so businesses that created programs tailored to their
workers could get some help doing it goes away as well and in some
[business credits are really important for research and
development]{.underline} expensing expensing of your equipment um
software all of that reverse to a very I think negative position there
so yeah uh 4 trillion or more of tax cuts that\'s that **[[that\'ll slam
the economy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and neither party I think has any
anything to win **[[by letting these expire]{.underline}]{.mark}** which
is where why you ask why some things are expiring some not so I\'m not
going to just blame it on Senate budget rules but I\'m going to blame it
on Senate budget rules because that\'s what did it but but our thinking
was to we locked in all the growth competitiveness because it\'s so
important on paychecks and jobs we left the more bipartison issues we
believed Republican Democrats would want to keep the middle class tax
cuts the small business tax cuts the child tax credit issues like that
where I think there\'ll be more common ground heading into 2025.

I want to go back to the inequality discussion because I take the point
about progressivism and the idea that the wealthy in America are paying
more taxes overall but my impression is the the the more
redistributionist countries that are out there I guess they don\'t
necessarily have really Progressive taxes but the difference is that the
tax that they get they direct more towards the poor so I guess my
question is could we reduce inequality through something other than
taxation could we we just spend in a different way in order to more
focused way yeah exactly you know perhaps but we have a pretty poor
track record of that unfortunately within our spending in the government
sort of that social safety net you know I I think we\'re all really
cognizant of you know we often discourage work in connecting back to the
workforce in in a lot of those when you put all that net to together you
on average you know in a State like Texas for that family whether it\'s
single mom or with with a couple children you know those benefits start
to add up like in Texas we\'re we\'re we\'re a little stingy on all that
it\'s still close to \$50,000 a year in a Pennsylvania it\'ll be 67 well
60 some thousand so the problem is is that you make it really hard for
people to move off out of the social safety net it\'s not in their
interest to do it or doesn\'t feel that way for them and so part of our
thinking again on the tax code was let\'s reward work you know what I
mean in in a way that allows them and encourages them to move uh back
into the workforce that happened in tcja certainly not to the level we
will need for the long term and covid changed everything sort of on
labor participation in change just changed the game that way so one of
the in criticisms of the current uh I don\'t know if current tax code is
people talk about this phenomenon of uh buy borrow die wealthy people
accumulate assets rather than sell them when they go up to enjoy the
fruits of their increased wealth they borrow against them and uh that
borrowing is uh taxfree and then they spend that and then you know
assets tend to go up like stocks over time and then they die and then
they\'re bequeathed to their children and the children get a step up and
basis such that they don\'t actually pay capital gains on the original
purchase of the real estate or the stock or whatever and so one thing
that was for about a week people were talking about it was like well
maybe we should have some sort of a tax on unrealized capital gains
seems very unlikely to me for all kinds of reasons but setting that
aside are there still issues out there that seem structurally wrong such
as Step Up in basis and some of these other ways that the wealthy can
accumulate ass without having a big tax bill before realizing their
benefits yeah you know I I um actually don\'t see that as an abuse in
the sense that you know we do that in our home equity loans you know
what I mean we build up we build up that value we borrow against for
something that\'s important the value hopefully keeps going up and and
when we pass on you know we do get an exemption and usually for us for
middle class you know they they don\'t get hammered with the estate tax
in any way so I I I don\'t know what\'s wrong with borrowing against
values you\'ve invested in and and I\'ll tell you this too most of those
Investments come I think because you know **[[our tax
code]{.underline}]{.mark}** we try to [**[drive]{.underline}**
**[investment]{.underline}**]{.mark} so you know when you earn a dollar
there\'s three things you can do with it you can spend it which a lot of
us do you can save which is economically better or you can invest
that\'s risky no guarantee you\'re getting it but is the most PR growth
of everything you do with that dollar and a lot of uh [we\'re trying to
encourage people of every income level to invest more save more and
invest more because]{.underline} usually
**[[it\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** good for them and **[[super for the
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and and one of my one of my concerns
always is when you go after unrealized gains or you know **[[tax
hikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the wealthy
you**[[\'re]{.underline}]{.mark}** actually [[taking]{.mark} those who
are the [super investors]{.mark}]{.underline} you know what I mean [in
our country are [willing to risk everything to **take us to Mars**
or]{.mark}]{.underline} you know in in some [**[Cutting Edge
technology]{.underline}** [that drives]{.underline}]{.mark} [jobs and
[opportunity]{.mark} in such a big way and so I\'m]{.underline} always
really [cautious about]{.underline} 35:36 just **[picking]{.underline}**
that group of **[villains]{.underline}** saying you you you know we need
more of your a fair share is how much your money you owe me yeah I think
economically and for the US it\'s really The **[innovation
and]{.underline}** the **[investment]{.underline}** we\'re **[[our tax
codes]{.mark} pretty [good at]{.mark} this [driving that
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

1 Introduction

[Tech]{.underline}nology [brings **prosperity**]{.underline}. Its impact
on existential risk---the risk of human extinction, or, equivalently for
decision purposes, of an equally complete and permanent loss of human
welfare---strikes many as ambiguous at best.1 [[Advances in]{.mark}
**vaccine [tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology [[render us less vulnerable
to]{.mark} **devastating [plagues]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[advances
in]{.mark} gain-of-function [virology]{.mark}]{.underline} arguably
[[make them **more** likely]{.underline}]{.mark} (Millett and
Snyder-Beattie, 2017).

[This raises the possibility of a **tradeoff**]{.underline}: [concern
for the survival of civilization may motivate **slowing
development**]{.underline}, at least outside some narrow domains.
Environmentalist sentiments along these lines go back at least to the
Club of Rome's 1972 report on the "Limits to Growth", and have recently
reemerged with calls to pause AI development (Future of Life Institute,
2023). Jones (2024) explores how to make the tradeoff between AI
development and AI risk, assuming the tradeoff exists.

Does it? Would slowing technological development reduce existential
risk?

To shed light on this question, we begin in Section 2 with a simple
model in which the hazard rate---the probability of catastrophe per
period---is a positive function of the technology level. Here, an
existential catastrophe must occur eventually unless in the long run
higher technology levels carry hazard rates that fall toward zero.

This leaves two possibilities. If advanced technology does not
eventually drive the hazard rate toward zero, then a catastrophe is
inevitable, so accelerating technological development cannot increase
its probability. Otherwise, however, [[a catastrophe is
**avoidable**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [acceleration can **lower its
probability** by hastening the arrival of
**safety**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This simple model formalizes two observations. The first is that if we
believe that the hazard rate is currently high, [our **only hope** for a
long and valuable future is the hope that we are living through a
temporary "**time of perils**".]{.underline} This view was 1See e.g.
Bostrom (2002), Posner (2004), Farquhar et al. (2017), Ord (2020), and
Jones (2024). We will refer to the event that humanity immediately goes
extinct or suffers a similarly complete and permanent loss of welfare as
an "existential catastrophe", or simply "catastrophe". 2 famously
expressed by Sagan (1997), who coined the phrase, and its implications
for those especially concerned about the long-term future are emphasized
by Parfit (1984), Ord (2020), and others. The second is less widely
appreciated: that if we are in a time of perils, with the hazard rate a
positive function of the technology level, then, though technological
development has increased the hazard rate so far, [deceleration for the
sake of long-term survival is **misguided**]{.underline}. [Speeding
tech]{.underline}nological [development]{.underline} may be temporarily
risky, but it [is safer in the long run]{.underline}.2

The model of Section 2 is not "economic". It studies the impact on risk
of quickly escaping risky states, not optimal policy under constraints.
It thus leaves open the possibility that, when consumption--risk
tradeoffs are navigated by a policymaker with little concern for
long-term survival, technological acceleration can increase risk after
all. Section 2 also offers no reason to believe that future states will
be safe. If one believes that technology has historically increased the
hazard rate, the hope that this relationship will reverse in the future
may seem naive.

In Section 3, we therefore introduce an environment in which technology
grows exogenously and its risks can be mitigated by policy. [As new
potentially dangerous technologies are introduced, [a
planner]{.mark}]{.underline}, discounting the future at an arbitrary
rate, [[decides how much consumption to sacrifice to lower the hazard
rate.]{.underline}]{.mark}

We illustrate that, even if technological advances in isolation always
raise the hazard rate, optimal [policy can generate an]{.underline}
"**[existential]{.underline}** risk **[K]{.underline}**uznets
**[curve]{.underline}**", with the hazard rate rising and then falling
as technology advances. Early, when the expected discounted value of the
future of civilization is low and the marginal utility of consumption is
high, [it is worthwhile to adopt risky technologies as they arrive.
Later]{.underline}, when the discounted future is more valuable and the
marginal utility of consumption has fallen, [substantial risk mitigation
becomes worthwhile.]{.underline}

[The possibility of a **policy response** thus offers an **economic
justification**]{.underline} [for the view that we may]{.underline}
indeed [be living through a once-in-history **time of
perils**]{.underline}. [[Safety is a **luxury
good**]{.mark},]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} technological
[[development generates a **wealth effect**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the
wealth effect is strong enough, then [[optimal policy]{.mark} eventually
[**lowers** the hazard]{.mark} quickly [enough that the probability of
escaping the time of perils is **positive**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This insight mirrors the logic of Stokey (1998) and Brock and Taylor
(2005), on which environmental damages rise and then fall with economic
development, and of Jones (2016, 2024), on which growth yields increases
in the value of life relative to marginal consumption. Like the analysis
presented here, these papers find that, given sufficiently concave
utility functions, [[**wealth increases** motivate]{.mark} large
[reallocations from **consumption** to **safety**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
None of these sources solve for the optimal path of a hazard rate over
time, however, or characterize conditions under which the probability of
a binary event (here, existential catastrophe) under optimal policy is
less than 1.

Our model of catastrophic risk differs more significantly from those of
Martin and Pindyck (2015, 2021) and Aurland-Bredesen (2019). That
literature studies a society's willingness to pay to reduce the risk of
catastrophes that are, or are equivalent to, proportional consumption
cuts. In such a context there are no wealth effects: the fraction of
consumption one is willing to sacrifice to avoid a proportional
consumption cut is, by definition, independent of one's consumption.

For the reasons that policy facilitates survival on a given (increasing)
technology path, optimal policy tends to magnify the extent to which
technological acceleration decreases long-term risk. As in the
policy-free model, [acceleration decreases the **time spent** in any
given risky state]{.underline}. Under optimal policy, however, [[the
wealthier]{.mark} future [states **pulled forward** by]{.mark} an
[acceleration are **systematically inclined** to be **safer**]{.mark},
due to the **wealth effect**]{.underline}. Furthermore, given an
increase to the future growth rate, even before actual productive
capacity has yet increased, [the [anticipation of a more valuable future
motivates **more stringent safety policy**]{.mark} in the
present.]{.underline}

### IL\-\--AT: Debt\-\--2NC

#### The US won't default from debt

**Nersisyan 3-26**-2025, chair of the economics department at Franklin &
Marshall College (Yeva, "The Trump tax cuts don't have to be paid for,"
*The Hill*,
https://thehill.com/opinion/5214096-trump-republicans-tax-cuts/)

President Trump and Republicans are trying to pass a bill to cut taxes
by \$4.5 trillion, and are trying to partially "pay for" those tax cuts
by reducing government spending by \$2 trillion, including cutting
Medicaid and SNAP by \$800 billion. Cutting government spending to "pay
for" tax cuts makes a bad economic policy much worse. If Republicans
want to cut taxes, **[[the best option]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
Democrats **[[is to]{.underline}]{.mark}** insist that they **[[not be
"paid for."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The signature economic accomplishment of Trump's first term was the 2017
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced tax rates for individuals and
corporations. Many of the 2017 provisions are set to expire this year,
which explains the rush to extend them now. One of the Democrats' main
arguments in 2017 was that the tax bill deepened the government deficit.
But this is the wrong way to judge the merits of tax policy.

[[Many believe]{.mark} that [the government]{.mark} is like a household
and that it [needs to collect tax revenue]{.mark} to be able [to spend.
This logic leads to a]{.mark} further [misconception
that]{.mark}]{.underline} spending increases and/or [[tax cuts have to
be]{.mark} "[paid]{.mark} for"]{.underline} or offset by new revenue or
spending cuts elsewhere in the budget.

While Congress has imposed rules that require deficit-neutral
legislation, [there is nothing inherent in our monetary system that
requires spending and taxation to go hand in hand.]{.underline} Spending
and taxation are macroeconomic tools with different functions that the
government can use to manage the economy. These tools, therefore, must
be evaluated separately, based on their impact on the economy.

And indeed, tax policy and spending policy are set differently --- taxes
through tax law, spending by appropriation. It is only a self-imposed
rule that links the two. Whether or not spending and taxation policies
lead to a deficit is immaterial and cannot be known in advance; we only
find out at the end of the fiscal year. What matters is whether they
allow the government to accomplish its policy goals.

[[Government deficits are not the same]{.mark} as private-sector
deficits. [The U.S. government cannot go bankrupt]{.mark}]{.underline}
because all of its obligations are denominated in the dollar --- the
currency that it issues and over which it has a monopoly. [[Our
government cannot]{.mark} run out of dollars or be forced to [default
due to]{.mark}]{.underline} having "too much"
**[[debt]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Even the
arch-conservative]{.underline} Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan
**[Greenspan]{.underline}** [said]{.underline} as much: "[The United
States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do
that. So]{.underline} **[[there is zero probability of
default]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

The commonly used argument that at some point taxes will have to be
raised to pay for the government debt does not correspond to the
historical reality either. Since World War II, income tax rates on the
wealthy and corporations have been frequently lowered in the U.S.,
demonstrating that taxation is ultimately a policy (and a political)
choice. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has never been forced to default
or to pay a premium on its debt by financial markets, despite a steadily
increasing debt-to-GDP ratio. Neither has the status of the dollar as
the global reserve currency been affected --- the dollar is as strong
today as it's ever been.

#### Deficit spending won't hurt the economy

**Nersisyan 3-26**-2025, chair of the economics department at Franklin &
Marshall College (Yeva, "The Trump tax cuts don't have to be paid for,"
The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/5214096-trump-republicans-tax-cuts/)

[Saying that it's okay to allow tax cuts to add to the
deficit]{.underline} will sound like blasphemy to many, [but [what is
worse]{.mark} --- allowing the tax cuts to [add to the deficit
or]{.mark} having Republicans "[**pay for**" them]{.mark} by cutting
Medicaid and SNAP?]{.underline}

In the past, [[both Democrats and Republicans]{.mark} have [passed
legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} through the reconciliation process
[[leading to an increase in the]{.mark} federal
[deficit]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the first Trump tax cuts were
largely "**unpaid** for."]{.underline} Further, [even the current tax
cuts aren't fully paid for]{.underline}; the \$4.5 trillion in decreased
tax revenue is only matched by spending reductions of \$2 trillion.

[[**It is fine** for the U.S. government to run deficits]{.mark} in its
own currency]{.underline} --- the dollar. [[This **has not** and **will
not** have a negative impact]{.mark} on the economy]{.underline}.
[[Cutting]{.mark} government [spending]{.mark},]{.underline} on the
other hand, will not only directly affect the recipients of programs
such as SNAP and Medicaid, but [[will have **ripple
effects**]{.underline}]{.mark} throughout the whole economy by reducing
our national income.

[Since the [tax cuts]{.mark} are likely to
**[pass]{.mark}**]{.underline} with or [[without Democratic
support]{.underline}]{.mark}, the best option for Democrats is to
negotiate with the Republicans to allow the tax cuts to go "unpaid."
[[This]{.mark} strategy will [allow]{.mark} the [Republicans to have
their cake and eat it, too]{.mark}]{.underline}. In exchange, Democrats
can save Medicaid and SNAP, at least for now.

### IL\-\--AT: Inflationary\-\--2NC

#### Not inflationary

**Nersisyan 3-26**-2025, PhD, **chair of the economics department at
Franklin & Marshall College** (Yeva, "The Trump tax cuts don't have to
be paid for," *The Hill*,
https://thehill.com/opinion/5214096-trump-republicans-tax-cuts/)

If deficits should not figure into evaluating the desirability of tax
policy, how should we think about taxes? There are two important issues
to consider in case of the proposed tax cuts. First, will this policy
lead to more income and excessive spending in the economy, thus becoming
inflationary? Second, does this policy negatively affect income and
wealth inequality?

[[Since much of what is in the 2025 bill would extend provisions of the
2017 legislation, it]{.underline} **[is unlikely to have a significant
inflationary impact]{.underline}**]{.mark}. However, the Republican tax
policy will continue to exacerbate income and wealth inequality, which
is exactly what the 2017 tax bill did. This, and not the budgetary
impact, is what makes the bill bad economic policy.

In sum, [this [statistical analysis shows]{.mark} that an **[economic
slowdown]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[increases]{.mark} the [likelihood
of]{.mark} **initiating military [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Specifically, [economically troubled]{.underline} autocracies [act more
**aggressively**]{.underline} toward democracies whose economies depend
on them. [Political unrest also]{.underline} **[increases]{.underline}**
[conflict initiation]{.underline}, as many studies of diversionary
conflict have argued. However, autocracies suffering from political
troubles do not seem to target economically dependent democracies.
Democracies with smaller economies seem to be attractive targets for
economically troubled autocracies whose leaders may blame the
politically different partner's 'unfair' trade and currency practices
and domestic policies for the deteriorating economy. The autocracies
will present their military decisions as inevitable to correct
international wrongs and reboot the national economy. Meanwhile,
[[leaders facing **political unrest**]{.underline}]{.mark} [may
[seek]{.mark} [diversionary **targets**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[initiating]{.mark} a [conflict]{.mark}** through which they can
mobilize their **support base**]{.underline} (and marginalize opposition
groups) [by [exploiting]{.mark} **ideological**, **religious**, and/or
**ethnic [identities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of 'us' and
'them'.]{.underline} Future studies should seek to unravel the complex
relationship between types and levels of domestic unrest and types and
combinations of political regimes, in either the presence or absence of
diversionary conflict. The findings of this study suggest that [an
attractive target is not **predetermined**]{.underline} [but is closely
related to the **domestic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[international]{.underline}** [situation confronted by
leaders]{.underline} who are battling for their political survival.
Summary and implications [Since the 2000s]{.underline}, many pundits and
[[scholars]{.mark} have [attributed]{.mark}]{.underline} **[two [rising
powers']{.mark}]{.underline}** [instances of [aggression to]{.mark}
their **[domestic problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Russia's invasion
of **Ukraine**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline} and its deployment of troops to Syria,
[along with [China's]{.mark} assertive [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[in]{.mark} the **[S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}, have been seen as aggressions arising out
of domestic weakness (Kaplan, 2016). [Some have attributed China's
recent **provocative** actions against **India**,
**Japan**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[Taiwan]{.underline}** [to
its struggling economy]{.underline} in the wake of the pandemic (Myers,
2020). In the post-Cold War period, these two great powers, often
regarded as revisionist powers, have regained their national
capabilities to some extent and have sought higher status in
international politics (Larson & Shevchenko, 2010). What made them more
aggressive in the 2010s? One promising explanation is their decreasing
economic growth rates. Due to their abundance of natural and human
resources, the two former communist countries had maintained their
increased status relative to their neighboring states since the 2000s or
even earlier. However, falling energy prices and the reform-incapable
structures of their economies retarded their further growth and
increased the burden on their authoritarian leaders, who also had to
manage domestic calls for political freedom and maintain the legitimacy
of their rule. According to this article's causal explanation, [Russia
and China [became **more revisionist**]{.mark} **actor**]{.underline}s
in the 2010s [at least partly [because]{.mark} their **[economies went
downhill]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and their aggressions were directed
at]{.underline} **[smaller]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [economies]{.underline}. A slowing economy and
economic dependence have both individual and interactive effects on
military conflict in international politics. [Slow growth rates
contribute]{.underline} **[positively to conflict
initiation]{.underline}**, especially when an autocracy suffering from a
slowing economy targets a democracy whose economy is dependent on the
autocracy. Whereas economic interdependence has been regarded by many
liberal scholars as a reason for international cooperation, this study
shows why and how asymmetric interdependence contributes to interstate
conflict by articulating its interaction with an economic slowdown in a
dyadic relationship. [Both political unrest and economic
problems]{.underline} **[have destabilizing effects]{.underline}** [on
international politics]{.underline}, but their effects differ when
economically dependent democracies are the target. Future research
should compare different types of domestic unrest and their effects on
international relations with sophisticated logic and strong evidence.
This analysis shows that economic growth has two distinct effects.
[Slower growth makes **one state weaker**]{.underline} [than others and
its leaders]{.underline} **[more vulnerable]{.underline}** [to domestic
challenges.]{.underline} [A state's economic slowdown not only causes
**a change**]{.underline} [in the [balance of]{.mark} **economic
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline} [so as to [favor]{.mark} its
[competitor]{.mark}]{.underline} [but]{.underline} [also
[increases]{.mark} the [troubled state's **foreign aggression**]{.mark},
which can **harm its adversary**.]{.underline} Therefore, it is
uncertain whether one state's economic slowdown benefits its rival's
security. An autocracy's slowing economy can be a warning, rather than
good news, to its democratic opponents if the latter maintain economic
relationships with the former. In this regard, economic sanctions may
provoke the target leader's diversionary tactic of blaming its poor
economy on the sanctioner. We can see this pattern in Tokyo's surprise
attack on Pearl Harbor at a time of US sanctions against Japan, which
had continued since the late 1930s. [The current **global economic
outlook**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} **[uncertain]{.underline}** [in
the wake of COVID-19]{.underline}. Although we do not yet know the
pandemic's long-term economic consequences, all states will likely
struggle with slower growth and the erosion of democracy and will engage
in more protectionist policies to reboot their economies and save major
industries. In this context, [we should be **especially
concerned**]{.underline} [about the risk that **troubled**]{.underline}
[economies pose]{.underline} **[to international
security]{.underline}**. As this study's findings suggest, [slower
growth causes]{.underline} **[domestic problems]{.underline}**, [which
often lead to the]{.underline} **[diversionary use]{.underline}** [of
force against foreign states]{.underline}. If we cannot prevent
struggling leaders from using diversionary tactics, [worsening
economies]{.underline} in authoritarian states [will]{.underline} likely
**[drive such states]{.underline}** [into a more
**confrontational**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[aggressive]{.underline}** [stance toward their economic
**partners**,]{.underline} if not toward political and ideological
partners. We can all hope world leaders will realize that this is a time
to beat a global pandemic and an economic recession, not to beat up on a
foreign state.

The rise of nationalism/populism is both cause and effect of this
economic outlook. [[**Lower growth** will make **every aspect of the
liberal order more difficult to resuscitate**]{.mark} post-Trump.
**Domestic [politics]{.mark}** [will become]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[**[polarized]{.mark}** and **dysfunctional**]{.underline}, [[as

downturns, [will be **unavailable**]{.underline}. A clear demonstration
of this negative feedback loop is the economic damage being inflicted on
the world by Trump's trade war with China, which--- despite the
so-called phase one agreement---has predictably escalated from
negotiating tactic to imbedded reality, with no end in sight. In a world
already suffering from inadequate investment, the uncertainties
generated by this confrontation will further curb the investments
essential for future growth. Another demonstration of the intersection
of structural forces is how populist-motivated controls on immigration
(always a weakness in the hyper-globalization narrative) deprives
developed countries of Summers' recommended policy response to secular
stagnation, which in a more open world would be a win-win for rich and
poor countries alike, increasing wage rates and remittance revenues for
the developing countries, replenishing the labor supply for rich
countries experiencing low birth rates.

Illiberal Globalization

**[[Economic weakness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and rising nationalism
(along with multipolarity) [[will not **end** globalization, but]{.mark}
will **[profoundly alter its character]{.mark}** and greatly reduce
its]{.underline} economic and political [benefits. Liberal]{.underline}
global [institutions]{.underline}, under American hegemony, have served
multiple purposes, enabling states to improve the quality of
international relations and more fully satisfy the needs of their
citizens, and provide companies with the legal and institutional
stability necessary to manage the inherent risks of global investment.
But under present and future conditions these institutions [will become
the]{.underline} battlegrounds---and the **[victims]{.underline}**---[of
**geopolitical competition**]{.underline}. The Trump Administration's
frontal attack on multilateralism is but the final nail in the coffin of
the Bretton Woods system in trade and finance, which has been in slow
but accelerating decline since the end of the Cold War. Future American
leadership may embrace renewed collaboration in global trade and
finance, macroeconomic management, environmental sustainability and the
like, but repairing the damage requires the heroic assumption that
America's own identity has not been fundamentally altered by the Trump
era (four years or eight matters here), and by the internal and global
forces that enabled his rise. The fact will remain that a sizeable
portion of the American electorate, and a monolithically pro-Trump
Republican Party, is committed to an illiberal future. And even if the
effects are transitory, the causes of weakening global collaboration are
structural, not subject to the efforts of some hypothetical future US
liberal leadership. It is clear that the US has lost respect among its
rivals, and trust among its allies. While its economic and military
capacity is still greatly superior to all others, its political
dysfunction has diminished its ability to convert this wealth into
effective power.13 It will furthermore operate in a future system of
diffusing material power, diverging economic and political governance
approaches, and rising nationalism. Trump has promoted these forces, but
did not invent them, and future US Administrations will struggle to cope
with them.

What will illiberal globalization look like? Consider recent events. The
instruments of globalization have been weaponized by strong states in
pursuit of their geopolitical objectives. This has turned the liberal
argument on behalf of globalization on its head. Instead of
interdependence as an unstoppable force pushing states toward
collaboration and convergence around market-friendly domestic policies,
states are exploiting interdependence to inflict harm on their
adversaries, and even on their allies. The increasing interaction across
national boundaries that globalization entails, now produces not
harmonization and cooperation, but friction and escalating trade and
investment disputes.14 The Trump Administration is in the lead here, but
it is not alone. Trade and investment friction with China is the most
obvious and damaging example, precipitated by China's long failure to
conform to the World Trade Organization (WTO) principles, now escalated
by President Trump into a trade and currency war disturbingly
reminiscent of the 1930s that Bretton Woods was designed to prevent.
Financial sanctions against Iran, in violation of US obligations in the
Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA), is another example of the
rule of law succumbing to geopolitical competition. Though more
mercantilist in intent than geopolitical, US tariffs on steel and
aluminum, and their threatened use in automotives, aimed at the EU,
Canada, and Japan,15 are equally destructive of the liberal system and
of future economic growth, imposed as they are by the author of that
system, and will spread to others. And indeed, Japan has used export
controls in its escalating conflict with South Korea16 (as did China in
imposing controls on rare earth,17 and as the US has done as part of its
trade war with China). Inward foreign direct investment restrictions are
spreading. The vitality of the WTO is being sapped by its inability to
complete the Doha Round, by the proliferation of bilateral and regional
agreements, and now by the Trump Administration's hold on appointments
to WTO judicial panels. It should not surprise anyone if, during a
second term, Trump formally withdrew the US from the WTO. At a minimum
it will become a "dead letter regime."18

As such measures gain traction, it will become clear to states---and to
companies---that a global trading system more responsive to raw power
than to law entails escalating risk and diminishing benefits. This will
be the end of economic globalization, and its many benefits, as we know
it. It represents nothing less than the subordination of economic
globalization, a system which many thought obeyed its own logic, to an
international politics of zero-sum power competition among multiple
actors with divergent interests and values. The costs will be
significant: Bloomberg Economics estimates that the cost in lost US GDP
in 2019- dollar terms from the trade war with China has reached \$134
billion to date and will rise to a total of \$316 billion by the end of
2020.19

Economically, the just-in-time, maximally efficient world of global
supply chains, driving down costs, incentivizing innovation, spreading
investment, integrating new countries and populations into the global
system, is being Balkanized. Bilateral and regional deals are
proliferating, while global, nondiscriminatory trade agreements are at
an end. Economies of scale will shrink, incentivizing less investment,
increasing costs and prices, compromising growth, marginalizing
countries whose growth and poverty reduction depended on participation
in global supply chains. A world already suffering from excess savings
(in the corporate sector, among mostly Asian countries) will respond to
heightened risk and uncertainty with further retrenchment. The problem
is perfectly captured by Tim Boyle, CEO of Columbia Sportswear, whose
supply chain runs through China, reacting to yet another ratcheting up
of US tariffs on Chinese imports, most recently on consumer goods:

We move stuff around to take advantage of inexpensive labor. That's why
we're in Bangladesh. That's why we're looking at Africa. We're putting
investment capital to work, to get a return for our shareholders. So,
when we make a wager on investment, this is not Vegas. We have to have a
reasonable expectation we can get a return. That's predicated on the
rule of law: where can we expect the laws to be enforced, and for the
foreseeable future, the rules will be in place? That's what America used
to be.20

The international political effects will be equally damaging. The four
structural forces act on each other to produce the more dangerous, less
prosperous world projected here. [Illiberal globalization]{.underline}
represents geopolitical conflict by (at first) physically non-kinetic
means. It arises from intensifying competition among powerful states
with divergent interests and identities, but in its effects [**drives
down** growth and fuels **increased nationalism**/**populism**, which
**further contributes to conflict**]{.underline}. Twenty-first-century
protectionism represents bottom-up forces arising from **[[economic
disruption]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
a top-down phenomenon, representing a strategic effort by political
leadership to reduce the constraints of interdependence on freedom of
geopolitical action, in effect [a **[precursor and enabler of
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is the disturbing hypothesis of Daniel
Drezner, argued in an important May 2019 piece in Reason, titled "Will
Today's Global Trade Wars Lead to World War Three,"21 which examines the
pre-World War I period of heightened trade conflict, its contribution to
the disaster that followed, and its parallels to the present:

Before the First World War started, powers great and small took a
variety of steps to thwart the globalization of the 19th century. Each
of these steps made it easier for the key combatants to conceive of a
general war.

We are beginning to see a similar approach to the globalization of the
21st century. One by one, the [**economic constraints** on **military
aggression** are **eroding**.]{.underline} And too many have
forgotten---or never knew---how this played out a century ago.

...In many ways, 19th century globalization was a victim of its own
success. Reduced tariffs and transport costs flooded Europe with
inexpensive grains from Russia and the United States. The incomes of
landowners in these countries suffered a serious hit, and the Long
Depression that ran from 1873 until 1896 generated pressure on European
governments to protect against cheap imports.

...The primary lesson to draw from the years before 1914 is not that
economic interdependence was a weak constraint on military conflict. It
is that, even in a globalized economy, governments can take
protectionist actions to reduce their interdependence in anticipation of
future wars.

In retrospect, the 30 years of tariff hikes, trade wars, and currency
conflicts that preceded 1914 were harbingers of the devastation to come.
[[Europea]{.mark}n governments [did not]{.mark} necessarily
**[want]{.mark}** to **ignite [a war]{.mark}**
[among]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**great powers**. By
**reducing**]{.mark} **their [interdependence]{.mark}**, however, [they
**made that**]{.mark} **option [conceivable]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

...[the backlash to globalization that preceded the Great War seems to
be **reprised in the current moment**]{.underline}. Indeed, there are
ways in which the current moment is scarier than the pre-1914 era. Back
then, the world's hegemon, the United Kingdom, acted as a brake on

article for about two weeks now, however life took over. I've been
pouring a lot on energy into a novel that I am halfway through
writing... things happen.

Now, as I currently put the finishing touches on this article--- Israel
seems to be under attack now from the South, North and the East. It
could be some opportunists, or it could be the opening salvo of a wider
campaign. I mentioned in February in one of my articles that Israel was
on my 2023 conflict list, you can read more about it here:

International conflicts & possible wars to beware of in 2023

The balance of power is shifting on the world stage

There are two internal obstacles going on, a very hardline Israeli
government, and a widespread rumor of a Third Intifada, which will lead
to a Palestinian uprising (among others). If this is the beginning of
the 3rd Intifada, it could be why we are seeing uprisings across France
over the next few days. Nothing happens in a vacuum.

With all that's going on, it can be difficult to keep track of. This is
the nature of the fog of war... crossed messages, propaganda (the kids
call it fake news these days), and multiple competing agendas.

[[Putin]{.mark} seems to have]{.underline} settle [\[[settled]{.mark}\]
[in for a]{.mark} very [**long spell** with

Right now things are sounding a lot like the precursors to WWI. Of
course the War in Ukraine is ongoing, [[tensions are at **boiling

the **Caucuses**]{.mark} with **Azerbaijan**]{.underline} attacking an

[How [The **Stage Is Set** For]{.mark} A [Wider War]{.mark}]{.underline}

History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes \~ Mark Twain

I find this quote very apropos in much of my research. Heck... even when
I go to visit my local cafe on the seafront. Humans are creatures of
habit. And just like there are very few new stories in the world, world
events aren't that creative either.

Unlike what you learned in school, WWI didn't begin because of the
assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand. This has become a historical short
hand to teach school children. WWI happened because of treaties. If
Germany hadn't decided to come to the aid of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
(and thus Ferdinand's family), and Russia hadn't backed it's Serbian
ally, it would have remained a regional conflict.

This is the reason you continually hear rhetoric from the U.S. State
Department about "containing the conflict" in Ukraine. However this is
relatively easy because the United States (or the Western allies) don't
have any long standing, deep treaties with Ukraine. Also, it isn't 'in
the water' at home. There isn't a huge diaspora of Ukrainians throughout
the United States. So it's been relatively easy to throw some money here
and there to the Ukrainian War, and the hard edged War Hawks have even
wondered how they could profit off the conflict. Don't take that
statement as support or approval, I'm just explaining a perspective.

Compare that to Israel. There is a huge Jewish population in the United
States. The Jewish culture is part of the American zeitgeist. Likewise
there are very long standing treaties and agreements between the U.S.
and Israel --- both economic and military. This is why, before the week
has been out, American warships are floating off the coast of Tel Aviv.
A massively different response.

This makes it sound a lot like WWI. The only piece of the puzzle missing
is a much larger military coming to the aid of the Palestinians. The
King of Jordan expressed his ire in late 2022. Somehow I doubt that will
happen. The old saying in the middle east is "You can't have war without
Egypt and you can't have peace without Syria." Would anything like this
actually happen. So far, it isn't looking likely --- at least from
Egypt. Only time will tell.

War Happens When You Aren't Looking

The average person right now is dealing with issues of cost of living.
As I scan the markets every day, there are serious economic issues from
middle America across the EU all the way to China. German manufacturing
is falling apart, as the Chinese economy crumbles it makes Taiwan's
manufacturing base look all the more appealing to invade --- just as
examples. Most importantly, [if the larger Economies are having
trouble]{.underline}, its very natural that [economies on the
periphery]{.underline} that aren't centers of economic buzz, [will
suffer even more. [The **longer** it goes on, the more]{.mark} likely
people will become discontent]{.underline}, **[[nationalism goes
up]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[countries]{.mark} begin to **[blame
outsiders]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [[what does this sound
like]{.mark}? **[WWII]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Germany was under so many economic constraints after WWI, an opportunist
saw a way of capturing the ire of the Germany population and used it to
his political advantage. In modern times think Putin --- except the dire
economic circumstances Russia is in are mostly self imposed through lack
of investment over decades of corruption and control.

Our spark may have come this week without very many people noticing -
which who could blame you. Earlier in the week, Finland reported a
strange leak in an oil pipeline between Finland and Estonia.

The leak is so bad, Finland has had to shut off oil transfers to
Estonia. Just in time for winter. It's such a large leak, many are
thinking sabotage --- but it is still under investigation. By mid-week,
NATO provided a stern warning that it will respond if this is found to
be caused by the Russians.

I'm sure the internet will have its own response. Some will say its
Russia, others will say its a NATO false flag... its an uninteresting
argument. The greater question is --- will this be the spark that
ignites a Third World War? With so many fires burning, is it worth
standing in the way?

If we were to go back in time, as people watched Hitler invade Poland,
they didn't say this is the start of WWII. When Arch Duke Ferdinand was
assassinated the media didn't say this is the start of WWI. The same
could even be said for the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The United States
declared war on Japan.

In the end there is never a declaration of a World War by anybody, but
it does seem that [[the **greatest declaration** is]{.mark} a long
period of [**economic hardship** followed by]{.mark} wide spread
[conflict]{.mark} usually [**fueled** by alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But would you really want to live in a world where nobody stood up for
their allies? That isn't an attractive prospect either.

### !\-\--Nuclear\-\--2NC

#### [Expectation]{.underline} of strong growth stops [nuclear war]{.underline}.

**Kampf 20**, senior PhD fellow at the Center for Strategic Studies @
The Fletcher School. (David, 6-16-2020, \"How COVID-19 Could Increase
the Risk of War,\" *World Politics Review*,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28843/how-covid-19-could-increase-the-risk-of-war)

Other theories posit that [**[economic bonds]{.mark}** between countries
have **[limit]{.mark}ed [wars]{.mark}** in recent decades]{.underline}.
Dale Copeland, a professor of international relations at the University
of Virginia, has argued that [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} work to
[[**preserve ties** when there are **high expectations for future
trade**]{.mark}, but [war becomes **increasingly possible** when trade
is **predicted to fall**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If [[globalization
brought peace]{.underline}]{.mark}, the recent wave of far-right
nationalism and populism around the world may increase the chances of
war, as tariffs and other trade barriers go up---mostly from the United
States under President Donald Trump, who has launched trade wars with
allies and adversaries alike.

The coronavirus pandemic immediately elicited further calls to reduce
dependence on other countries, with Trump using the opportunity to
pressure U.S. companies to reconfigure their supply chains away from
China. For its part, China made sure that it had the homemade supplies
it needed to fight the virus before exporting extras, while countries
like France and Germany barred the export of face masks, even to
friendly nations. And widening economic inequalities, a consequence of
the pandemic, are not likely to enhance support for free trade.

This assault on open trade and globalization is just one aspect of a
decaying liberal international order, which, its proponents argue, has
largely helped to preserve peace between nations since World War II. But
that old order is almost gone, and in all likelihood isn't coming back.
The U.N. Security Council appears increasingly fragmented and
dysfunctional. Even before Trump, the world's most powerful country
ratified fewer treaties per year under the Obama administration than at
any time since 1945.

Trump's presidency only harms multilateral cooperation further. He has
backed out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, reneged on the Iran
nuclear deal, picked fights with allies, questioned the value of NATO
and defunded the World Health Organization in the middle of a global
health crisis. Hyper-nationalism, rather than international
collaboration, was the default response to the coronavirus outbreak in
the U.S. and many other countries around the world.

It's hard to see the U.S. reluctance to lead as anything other than a
sign of its inevitable, if slow, decline. The country's
institutionalized inequalities and systemic racism have been laid bare
in recent months, and it no longer looks like a beacon for others to
follow. The global balance of power is changing. China is both keen to
assert a greater leadership role within traditionally Western-led
institutions and to challenge the existing regional order in Asia.
[[Between a **rising China**, **revanchist Russia** and **new global
actors**]{.mark}, including non-state groups, we may be heading toward
an increasingly **multipolar** or **nonpolar world**, which could prove
**destabilizing in its own right**.]{.underline}

Finally, the pacifying effect of nuclear weapons could be waning.
[While]{.underline} vast **[nuclear arsenals]{.underline}**
[once]{.underline} [compelled]{.underline} the United States and the
Soviet Union to reach [arms control]{.underline} agreements, [old
treaties are **expiring** and new talks are breaking down. **Mistrust is
growing**, and [the chance of a]{.mark}n **unwanted U.S.-Russia [nuclear
confrontation]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} arguably as
**[[high]{.underline}]{.mark}** as it has been since the Cuban missile
crisis.

The theory of nuclear peace may no longer hold if more countries are
tempted to obtain their own nuclear deterrent. Trump's decision to
abandon the Iran nuclear deal, for one thing, has only increased the
chance that [**Tehran** will acquire **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}.
It's almost easy to forget that, just a few short months ago, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Iran were **one
miscalculation**]{.underline} or ~~dumb~~ mistake [**away** from waging
**all-out war**]{.underline}. And despite Trump's efforts to negotiate
nuclear disarmament with Kim Jong Un's regime in Pyongyang, it is
wishful thinking to believe North Korea will give up its nuclear
weapons. At this point, negotiators can only realistically try to ensure
that North Korea's nuclear menace doesn't get even more potent.

In other words, by turning inward, the United States is choosing to
leave other countries to fend for themselves. The end result may be a
less stable world with more nuclear actors.

If leaders are smart, they will take seriously the warning signs exposed
by this global emergency and work to reverse the drift toward war.

If only one of these theories for peace were worsening, concerns would
be easier to dismiss. But together, they are unsettling. While the world
is not yet on the brink of World War III and no two countries are
destined for war, the odds of avoiding future conflicts don't look good.

The pandemic is already degrading democracies, harming economies and
curtailing international cooperation, and it also seems to be fostering
internal instability within states. Rachel Brown, Heather Hurlburt and
Alexandra Stark argue that the coronavirus could in fact sow more civil
conflict. If this proves accurate, the [increase in civil wars is likely
to lead to more **external meddling**, and these next [**proxy wars**
could]{.mark} soon [precipitate **all-out**]{.mark} **international
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} if outsiders aren't careful. [With the
**usual deterrents** to conflict **declining** around the world, **major
wars** could **soon return**.]{.underline}

"[There have been **as many plagues** as **wars** in
history]{.underline}," wrote Albert Camus in "The Plague," "yet always
plague and wars take people equally by surprise." The world was
certainly unprepared for COVID-19, but in just a year and a half after
the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified, 5 billion doses of vaccines have
been administered --- an unprecedented response. [[American
pharma]{.underline}]{.mark}ceutical [[manufacturers have been **leading
the fight**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration
has granted approval or emergency authorization to three vaccines. Two
were developed by U.S. companies and the other by a U.S.-German
partnership. In addition, the FDA has approved a single therapeutic,
Veklury (also called remdesivir), to treat cases of COVID-19. Veklury is
a drug developed in this country. [This is **no accident**. The U.S.
leads]{.underline}, in large part, [because our government has been wise
to resist **counterproductive constraints on innovation**.]{.underline}
[Successfully [developing a drug requires **billions** in capital, and
**any firm**]{.mark} embarking [on such a venture]{.mark}
**[requires]{.mark}** the possibility of [a **reward**]{.mark} for
taking **enormous risk**]{.underline}. In recent years, governments in
Europe and other parts of the world have introduced price controls on
medicines, and their pharmaceutical industries have suffered
accordingly. As recently as 1990, European pharmaceutical companies were
spending far more on research and development than U.S. firms. But,
according to a new report of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical
Industries and Associations, by 2019, [U.S. companies were spending \$64
billion annually on R&D, or **50% more** than their European
counterparts]{.underline}. From 2016 to 2020, R&D by U.S. companies rose
at an annual average rate of 7.6%; by European companies, just 3.1%.
[R&D is **paying off for patients**]{.underline}. [The FDA has already
approved **34 new drugs** this **year**,]{.underline} including 12
therapies for cancer and others for conditions such as lupus,
schizophrenia, heart failure and kidney disease. Unfortunately however,
President Biden, despite his goal to "end cancer as we know it," has [a
plan that]{.underline} threatens the U.S. health innovation model. On
Aug. 12, the president proposed that Medicare authorities would
"negotiate" prices with pharmaceutical companies. In other words, the
president wants price controls on drugs. How prices would be determined
by the government is vague. Setting artificially low prices
[would]{.underline} impede patients' access to treatments today and
[**discourage** companies from **investing** in the **drugs of
tomorrow**]{.underline}. There's simply no way to reduce Medicare drug
spending by hundreds of billions of dollars --- the savings that
Democrats are targeting --- without it [[resulting
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[less R&D]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} ultimately,
**[fewer new drugs]{.mark}** and **vaccines**. Such measures [would
**impede** our ability to **foresee future pandemics** and]{.mark}
**find tools to [counter them]{.mark}**. This preparedness is
**essential**, because [additional health crises are
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States recently recorded
four cases of Melioidosis, an infectious disease in several tropical
regions, including Central America. And on Aug.11, 2021, the WHO
reported that for the first time a case of the Marburg Virus was seen in
Guinea in West Africa, a tropical hemorrhagic disease related to Ebola
that had caused smaller eruptions in East Africa in the past. Rather
than risking such a disaster, Washington could reform the Medicare
insurance system itself. Incredibly enough, Medicare has no cap on
outlays in its "catastrophic" phase, reached by about 4% of the system's
60 million enrollees, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Biden
wants to set a cap on "the amount that seniors have to spend on
prescription drugs each year at no more than ... \$250 a month on
average. That'd be a game changer." He's right. Changing the structure
of Medicare insurance would not only be fairer for America's seniors, it
would also avoid disrupting the innovation model that has already
prevented millions of COVID-19 deaths. [[We can be **certain**
that]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Camus wrote, [**[other plagues are
coming]{.mark}**, but, [with a **strong system** of
**developing**]{.mark} and **manufacturing** the best vaccines and

Indeed, China has shown great interest in biotechnology, even if it has
yet to catch up to the United States. Combined with massive computing
power and artificial intelligence, [[innovations in

[Specialists in synthetic biology have invented a new way of producing
nylon-with genetically engineered microorganisms instead of
petrochemicals]{.underline}. The economic implications of the coming
biotechnology revolution are staggering: the McKinsey Global Institute
has estimated the value of biotechnology\'s many potential applications
at up to \$4 trillion over the next ten to 20 years. Like all powerful
technologies, however, biotechnology has a dark side. It is not
inconceivable, for example, that some malicious actor could create a
biological weapon that targeted a specific ethnic group. On
controversial questions-such as how much manipulation of the human
genome is acceptable-countries will accept different degrees of risk in
the name of progress and take different ethical positions. [The
[**country** that **leads biotech**]{.mark}nology\'s [**development**
will]{.mark} be the one that]{.underline} most profoundly
[[shapes]{.mark} the [**norms** and **standards** around its
**use**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And there is reason to worry if that
country is China. In 2018, the Chinese scientist He Jiankui genetically
engineered the DNA of twin babies, prompting an international uproar.
Beijing portrayed him as a rogue researcher and punished him. Yet the
Chinese government\'s disdain for human rights, coupled with its quest
for technological supremacy, suggests that it could embrace a lax, even
dangerous approach to bioethics. THINKING BIGGER Washington has
monitored China\'s technological progress through a military lens,
worrying about how it contributes to Chinese defense capabilities. But
the challenge is much broader. China\'s push for technological supremacy
is not simply aimed at gaining a battlefield advantage; Beijing is
changing the battlefield itself. Although commercial technologies such
as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology
will undoubtedly have military applications, China envisions a world of
great-power competition in which no shots need to be fired.
Technological supremacy promises the ability to dominate the civilian
infrastructure on which others depend, providing enormous influence.
That is a major motivation behind Beijing\'s support for high-tech
civilian infrastructure exports. The countries buying Chinese systems
may think they are merely receiving electric grids, health-care
technology, or online payment systems, but in reality, they may also be
placing critical national infrastructure and citizens\' data in
Beijing\'s hands. Such exports are China\'s Trojan horse. Despite the
changing nature of geopolitical competition, the United States still
tends to equate security with traditional defense capabilities. Consider
microelectronics. They are critical components not only for a range of
commercial products but also for virtually every major defense system,
from aircraft to warships. Because they will power advances in
artificial intelligence, they will also shape the United States\' future
economic competitiveness. Yet investment in microelectronics has fallen
through the cracks. Neither the private sector nor the government is
adequately funding innovation-the former due to the large capital
requirements and long time horizons involved and the latter because it
has focused more on securing current supplies than on innovating.
Although China has had a hard time catching up to the United States in
this area, it is only a matter of time before it moves up the
microelectronics value chain. Another casualty of the United States\'
overly narrow conception of security and innovation is 5G technology. By
dominating this market, China has built a global telecommunications
network that can serve geopolitical purposes. One fear is that Beijing
could help itself to data running on 5G networks. Another is the
possibility that China might sabotage or disrupt adversaries\'
communications networks in a crisis. Most U.S. policymakers failed to
predict the threat posed by Chinese 5G infrastructure. It wasn\'t until
2019 that Washington sounded the alarm about Huawei, but by then, there
was little it could do. U.S. companies had never offered an end-to-end
wireless network, instead focusing on manufacturing individual
components, such as handsets and routers. Nor had any developed its own
radio access network, a system for sending signals across network
devices that is needed to build an end-to-end 5G system like that
offered by Huawei and a few other companies. As a result, the United
States found itself in an absurd situation: threatening to end
intelligence cooperation if close allies adopted Huawei\'s 5G technology
without having an attractive alternative to offer. A Huawei 5G testing

On its current path, [[humanity is heading for]{.underline}]{.mark} a

will not only lead to poorer health care and an increase in the number

lives a year and a cumulative 100 trillion USD of economic output are at
risk due to the rise of drug-resistant infections" (O'Neill 2016: 4 and

especially because of its rather speculative nature due to the opaque

era]{.mark}]{.underline} (Engström 2021: 21). Since our current handling
of [antibiotics]{.underline} and antibiotic resistance [have a very
significant impact on the future, this]{.underline} becomes not only a
long-term [[is]{.mark}sue]{.underline}, but also [[a question of
**intergenerational justice**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For as medically and
morally defensible as some of [our [current antibiotic
use]{.mark}]{.underline} may be, it (re)[[imposes]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [extreme [vulnerability to]{.mark}]{.underline} bacterial infections
that has plagued humanity for most of its
**[[existence]{.underline}]{.mark}** on **[[future
generations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The danger is imminent, because, if
we allow resistance to increase, in a few decades we may start dying
from the most commonplace of ailments that can today be treated easily."
(Davies et al. 2013: x)

This forecast underpins the World Health Organization's (2020) urgent
and point-blank reminder that "\[w\]ithout urgent action, we are heading
for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries
can once again kill." Notwithstanding the limitations that humanity
already faces, [[if]{.mark} this [post-antibiotic]{.mark} scenario
[becomes a reality]{.mark}, humankind will no longer be able to treat
bacterial infections]{.underline} as it can today. As a result, [[future
generations]{.mark} may]{.underline} no longer be able to benefit from
the medicalpharmaceutical achievements we have come to know, and
**[indeed [face an existential threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With this
in mind, the task ahead seems to be quite clear: Possible
**[[solutions]{.mark} for tackling antibiotic resistance [are
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### It's existential, and outweighs war [and]{.underline} warming

**McCleskey 24**, citing Dr. Cesar Arias, chief of Infectious Disease at
Houston Methodist Hospital (Eden, "WATCH: Antimicrobial Resistance
Expert Sounds the Alarm," Houston Methodist,
https://www.houstonmethodist.org/leading-medicine-blog/articles/2024/apr/watch-antimicrobial-resistance-expert-sounds-the-alarm/)

[[When it comes to]{.mark} looming **e[x]{.mark}istential
[threats]{.mark}**, [war]{.mark},]{.underline} famine [and [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} tend to get top billing, but medical
scientists are focused on [[one]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[[deserves]{.mark} significantly [more]{.mark}]{.underline}** public
**[[attention]{.underline}]{.mark}** than it gets:
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nti**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**icrobial
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**esistance.

Antimicrobial resistance occurs when infections develop the ability to
defeat the drugs designed to kill them. To combat such infections, newer
and stronger antimicrobials must be developed and deployed. Eventually
the [[germs evolve]{.mark}]{.underline} new ways to respond and survive,
[trapping us in a]{.underline} costly, escalating and seemingly endless
[game of cat and mouse]{.underline}.

Dr. Cesar Arias, chief of Infectious Disease at Houston Methodist
Hospital, has been at the forefront of antimicrobial resistance research
for more than 25 years. He is fascinated by the way bacteria can change
and adapt in response to antimicrobial agents and how this can have
enormous clinical and public health consequences.

\"Historically, [[we\'ve underestimated bacteria\'s]{.mark} remarkable
[genetic abilities to adapt and survive and taken for granted that
antibiotics would always work]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Dr. Arias says.
\"[[That is]{.mark} already proving to be [false]{.mark}]{.underline},
and **[[the situation is]{.mark} only [getting
worse]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria currently causes over 35,000 deaths in the
United States each year and contributes to nearly 5 million annual
global deaths.

\"By the year 2050, there will be more deaths due to antibiotic
resistant infections than cancer,\" Dr. Arias says. \"This is one of the
defining health problems of our age.\"

In 2021, Dr. Arias joined Houston Methodist to lead its renowned team of
infectious disease researchers and clinicians and launch its ambitious
new Center for Infectious Diseases Research dedicated to building on
successes and lessons learned during the Covid-19 pandemic to advance
public health.

By recruiting one of the most accomplished experts in the field, Houston
Methodist singled out antimicrobial resistance as one of its top
research priorities, a move it hoped would inspire others to follow
suit.

\"[Superbugs]{.underline} and MRSA outbreaks [are]{.underline} certainly
[alarming]{.underline}, but our biggest fear is that [[we may reach a
point where antibiotics]{.mark} simply [don\'t work]{.mark}
anymore]{.underline},\" Dr. Arias explained. \"**[[That would be
catastrophic]{.underline}]{.mark}** because nearly everything we do in
modern day medicine, whether it\'s treating cancer or transplanting
organs, performing an emergency c-section or developing one of the
countless minimally invasive procedures to help patients manage chronic
and acute conditions, all of these are dependent on our ability to
control infections along the way.\"

[[AMR is the ability of microorganisms]{.underline}]{.mark} -- including

such as [[antibiotics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Alexander Fleming himself
hinted at the risk of penicillin resistance during his 1945 Nobel Prize

that is unfolding today.

[[A]{.mark} growing list [of **unsettling** statistics paints
the]{.mark} picture of a [world **on the brink**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), [antibiotic-resistant
bacterial infections were estimated to be directly responsible for 1.27
million deaths]{.underline}, and associated with 4.95 million deaths, in
2019 alone (4). Globally, there were an estimated 450,000 incident cases
of multi-drug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB)
with increasing trends in many regions (5). **[These [numbers
are]{.mark}]{.underline}** staggering, and are **[[expected to

#### Resistant bacteria survive without a living host

**Zaman 20**, Interview with Muhammad H. Zaman, professor of
international health and biomedical engineering at Boston University.
Interviewed by Eric Allen Been. (5-12-2020, \"Antibiotic-Resistant
Superbugs Could Be Worse Than Covid-19\", *Medium*,
https://onezero.medium.com/antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-could-be-worse-than-covid-19-a732bc3b944c)

Do you think [an outbreak of [a superbug poses]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} bigger **[[existential
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** than what we're currently facing with the
coronavirus?

That's something I've been thinking a lot about. My sense is it might.
Again, we don't know. And the reason I would say that is oftentimes what
happens with the bacterial systems is bacteria and viruses survive very
differently. [[A virus]{.mark} by definition [**needs** a living
host]{.mark} to multiply]{.underline}---a bacterial cell, a human cell,
a skin cell, whatever---but [[you **don't**]{.mark} **need that** [with
bacteria]{.mark}.]{.underline}

So, their ability to mutate, their ability to survive on surfaces and
divide is very different. That's one thing. [[Bacteria can survive in
the **water**. They can be on **surfaces** for]{.mark} much
**[long]{.mark}er [periods]{.mark} of time**]{.underline}. And then the
**[[bacterial infections]{.underline}]{.mark}** we might end up dealing
with are going to [**[complicate]{.mark}** all kinds of basic
things]{.underline}---**[basic]{.underline}** routine elective
**[surgery]{.underline}**, **[[basic
procedures]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[and [it may be]{.mark}]{.underline}
much, **[[much harder to control]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

I think [the]{.underline} viral [vaccine]{.underline} against Covid-19
is a hope and a dream for all of us and may be a year away, it [may be
six months away]{.underline}, it may be 18 months away. But [for a wide
variety of bacterial infections, it may be]{.underline} much, **[much
harder]{.underline}**. That's one thing. The second thing is you have to
also remember that [some species of [bacteria can
**transfer**]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[**genetic material** to
another]{.mark} species [and **make it resistant**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In other words, it's not just bacteria giving resistance to its next
generation; it's also one bacteria giving it to another horizontally.
That's a problem, and [that can really speed it up quite a
bit.]{.underline}

#### Interconnectedness makes finding new hosts easy

**Bar-Yam 16**, Physicist and complex systems scientist, Founding
President of the New England Complex Systems Institute, Ph.D., S.B.,

extinction: Pandemics in a connected world", *NECSI*, 7-3-2016,
http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/transition)

\[ FIGURE 1 OMITTED \] The video (Figure 1) shows a simple model of
hosts and pathogens we have used to study evolutionary dynamics. In the
animation, the green are hosts and red are pathogens. As pathogens
infect hosts, they spread across the system. If you look closely, you
will see that the red changes tint from time to time --- that is the
natural mutation of pathogens to become more or less aggressive. Watch
as one of the more aggressive---brighter red --- strains rapidly
expands. After a time it goes extinct leaving a black region. Why does
it go extinct? The answer is that it spreads so rapidly that it kills
the hosts around it. Without new hosts to infect it then dies out
itself. That the rapidly spreading pathogens die out has important
implications for evolutionary research which we have talked about
elsewhere \[1--7\]. In the research I want to discuss here, what we were
interested in is the effect of adding long range transportation \[8\].
This includes natural means of dispersal as well as unintentional
dispersal by humans, like adding airplane routes, which is being done by
real world airlines (Figure 2). \[ FIGURE 2 OMITTED \] [When we
introduce long range transportation into the model, the success of more
[aggressive strains]{.mark} changes]{.underline}. They can
[[use]{.underline}]{.mark} the [long range [**transportation**
to]{.mark} find new hosts and [escape local
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Figure 3 shows that [the more
transportation routes introduced into the model, the more higher
aggressive pathogens are able to survive and spread]{.underline}. \[
FIGURE 3 OMITTED \] As we add more long range transportation, [there is
a critical point at which pathogens become so aggressive that the
**entire host population** dies]{.underline}. The pathogens die at the
same time, but that is not exactly a consolation to the hosts. [We call
this the phase **transition to extinction**]{.underline} (Figure 4).
[[With **increasing**]{.mark} **levels of [global
transportation]{.mark}**[, human civilization]{.mark} may be
**[approaching such a critical threshold]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Figure 4: [The probability of survival makes a sharp
transition]{.underline} (red line) [from one to zero as we add more long
range transportaion]{.underline} (horizontal axis). The right line
(black) holds for different model parameters, so we need to study at
what point the transition will take place for our world.

In the paper we wrote in 2006 about the dangers of global transportation
for pathogen evolution and pandemics \[8\], we mentioned the risk from
Ebola. Ebola is a horrendous disease that was present only in isolated
villages in Africa. It was far away from the rest of the world only
because of that isolation. Since Africa was developing, it was only a
matter of time before it reached population centers and airports. While
the model is about evolution, it is really about which pathogens will be
found in a system that is highly connected, and Ebola can spread in a
highly connected world. [The traditional approach to public health uses
**[historical evidence]{.mark} analyzed statistically** to assess the
potential impacts of a disease. As a result, many were surprised by the
spread of Ebola through West Africa in 2014. As the connectivity of the
world increases, **past experience [is not a good guide]{.mark}** to
future events. [A key]{.mark} point [about the]{.mark} phase
[**transition to extinction** is its **suddenness**]{.mark}. Even a
system that seems stable, can be destabilized by a **few more**
long-range connections, and connectivity is continuing to
increase]{.underline}. So how **[[close]{.underline}]{.mark}** are we
**[[to the tipping point]{.underline}]{.mark}**? We don't know but it
would be good to find out before it happens. While Ebola ravaged three
countries in West Africa, it only resulted in a handful of cases outside
that region. One possible reason is that many of the airlines that fly
to west Africa stopped or reduced flights during the epidemic \[9\]. In
the absence of a clear connection, public health authorities who
downplayed the dangers of the epidemic spreading to the West might seem
to be vindicated. As with the choice of airlines to stop flying to west
Africa, our analysis didn't take into consideration how people respond
to epidemics. It does tell us what the outcome will be [unless we
respond fast enough and well enough to stop the spread of future
diseases]{.underline}, which may not be the same as the ones we saw in
the past. [As the world becomes more connected, the dangers
increase]{.underline}. Are people in western countries safe because of
higher quality health systems? Countries like [[**the U.S.**
have]{.mark} highly skewed networks of social interactions with some
very [highly connected]{.mark} individuals that can be
"**[superspreaders]{.mark}**." The chances of such an individual
becoming infected may be low but events like a mass **outbreak pose a
much greater risk** if they do happen. If a]{.underline} sick food
service worker in an airport infects 100 passengers, or a [contagion
event happens in mass transportation, an outbreak could very well prove
**unstoppable**]{.underline}. Watch this mock video of a pathogen
spreading globally through land and air transportation. Long range
transportation will continue to pose a threat of pandemic if its impacts
cannot be contained.

#### Empirical burnout irrelevant

**Ord 20**, PhD in Philosophy @ Oxford (Toby, "Why we need worst-case
thinking to prevent pandemics," The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk)

The world is in the early stages of what may be the most deadly pandemic
of the past 100 years. In China, thousands of people have already died;
large outbreaks have begun in South Korea, Iran and Italy; and the rest
of the world is bracing for impact. We do not yet know whether the final
toll will be measured in thousands or hundreds of thousands. For all our
advances in medicine, [[humanity remains]{.underline}]{.mark} much more
[[vulnerable to pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} than we would like to
believe.

To understand our vulnerability, and to determine what steps must be
taken to end it, it is useful to ask about the very worst-case
scenarios. Just how bad could a pandemic be? In science fiction, we
sometimes encounter the idea of a pandemic so severe that it could cause
the end of civilisation, or even of humanity itself. Such a risk to
humanity's entire future is known as an existential risk. We can say
with certainty that the novel coronavirus, named Covid-19, does not pose
such a risk. But could the next pandemic? To find out, and to put the
current outbreak into greater context, let us turn to the past.

[In 1347]{.underline}, death came to Europe. It entered through the
Crimean town of Caffa, brought by the besieging Mongol army. Fleeing
merchants unwittingly carried it back to Italy. From there, it spread to
France, Spain and England. Then up as far as Norway and across the rest
of Europe -- all the way to Moscow. Within six years, the Black Death
had taken the continent.

[Tens of millions fell gravely ill]{.underline}, their bodies succumbing
to the disease in different ways. Some bore swollen buboes on their
necks, armpits and thighs; some had their flesh turn black from
haemorrhaging beneath the skin; some coughed blood from the necrotic
inflammation of their throats and lungs. All forms involved fever,
exhaustion and an intolerable stench from the material that exuded from
the body.

There were so many dead that mass graves needed to be dug and, even
then, cemeteries ran out of room for the bodies. The Black Death
devastated Europe. In those six years, between a quarter and half of all
Europeans were killed. The Middle East was ravaged, too, with the plague
killing about one in three Egyptians and Syrians. And it may have also
laid waste to parts of central Asia, India and China. Due to the scant
records of the 14th century, we will never know the true toll, but our
best estimates are that somewhere between 5% and 14% of all the world's
people were killed, in what may have been the greatest catastrophe
humanity has seen.

[The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history]{.underline}. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. In
AD541 the plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine empire. Over three
years, it took the lives of roughly 3% of the world's people.

When Europeans reached the Americas in **[1492]{.underline}**, the two
populations exposed each other to completely novel diseases. Over
thousands of years, each population had built up resistance to their own
set of diseases, but were extremely susceptible to the others. The
American peoples got by far the worse end of the exchange, through
diseases such as measles, influenza and, especially, smallpox.

pandemic.

During the next 100 years, a combination of invasion and disease took an
immense toll -- one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90% of the population of the Americas during
that century, though the number could also be much lower. And it is very
difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed to war and
occupation, rather than disease. At a rough estimate, as many as 10% of
the world's people may have been killed.

[Centuries later, the [world had become so interconnected]{.mark} that
[a **truly global pandemic** was possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Towards
the end of the first world war, a devastating strain of influenza, known
as the 1918 flu or Spanish flu, spread to six continents, and even
remote Pacific islands. About a third of the world's population were
infected and between 3% and 6% were killed. This death toll outstripped
that of the first world war.

Yet even events like these fall short of being a threat to humanity's
long-term potential. In the great bubonic plagues we saw civilisation in
the affected areas falter, but recover. The regional 25%-50% death rate
was not enough to precipitate a continent-wide collapse. It changed the
relative fortunes of empires, and may have substantially altered the
course of history, but if anything, it gives us reason to believe that
human civilisation is likely to make it through future events with
similar death rates, even if they were global in scale.

The Spanish flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little apparent
effect on the world's development, despite its global reach. It looks as
if it was lost in the wake of the first world war, which, despite a
smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the course
of history.

The full history of humanity covers at least 200,000 years. While we
have scarce records for most of these 2,000 centuries, there is a key
lesson we can draw from the sheer length of our past. The chance of
human extinction from natural catastrophes of any kind must have been
very low for most of this time -- or we would not have made it so far.
But could these risks have changed? Might the past provide false
comfort?

[Our population now is a thousand times greater than it was for most of
human history, so there are vastly more opportunities for new human
diseases to originate]{.underline}. And our farming practices have
created vast numbers of animals living in unhealthy conditions within
close proximity to humans. This increases the risk, as many major
diseases originate in animals before crossing over to humans. Examples
include HIV (chimpanzees), Ebola (bats), Sars (probably civets or bats)
and influenza (usually pigs or birds). We do not yet know where Covid-19
came from, though it is very similar to coronaviruses found in bats and
pangolins. Evidence suggests that diseases are crossing over into human
populations from animals at an increasing rate.

[[Modern civilisation may]{.mark} also [make it much easier]{.mark} for
a pandemic to spread]{.underline}. The higher density of people living
together in cities increases the number of people each of us may infect.
Rapid long-distance transport greatly increases the distance pathogens
can spread, reducing the degrees of separation between any two people.
Moreover, we are no longer divided into isolated populations as we were
for most of the past 10,000 years.

Together these effects suggest that we might expect more new pandemics,
for them to spread more quickly, and to reach a higher percentage of the
world's people.

But we have also changed the world in ways that offer protection. We
have a healthier population; improved sanitation and hygiene;
preventative and curative medicine; and a scientific understanding of
disease. Perhaps most importantly, we have public health bodies to
facilitate global communication and coordination in the face of new
outbreaks. We have seen the benefits of this protection through the
dramatic decline of endemic infectious disease over the past century
(though we can't be sure pandemics will obey the same trend). Finally,
we have spread to a range of locations and environments unprecedented
for any mammalian species. This offers special protection from
extinction events, because it requires the pathogen to be able to
flourish in a vast range of environments and to reach exceptionally
isolated populations such as uncontacted tribes, Antarctic researchers
and nuclear submarine crews.

It is hard to know whether these combined effects have increased or
decreased the existential risk from pandemics. This uncertainty is
ultimately bad news: **[[we were previously sitting on a powerful
argument]{.mark} that [the risk was tiny; now we are
not]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

## ANSWER TO IMPACT TURNS

### AT Trump Authoritarianism Impact Turn

#### Trump is unchecked now

**Pilkington 3-9**, chief reporter, Chair of the Board of Directors at
OurBrainBank for Glioblastom (Ed, 3-9-2025, "'Nothing like this in
American history': the crisis of Trump's assault on the rule of law,"
The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/09/trump-assault-rule-of-law)

When the chief justice of the US supreme court, John Roberts, delivered
his bombshell ruling last July granting Donald Trump absolute immunity
from criminal prosecution for official acts, he laid out his vision of
an expansive presidency. The executive, he wrote, should be "vigorous
and energetic", and free to carry out duties "boldly and fearlessly".

If that sums up Roberts' ideal occupant of the Oval Office, then he has
certainly got what he wants in the 47th president. In his first month
back, Trump has vigorously fired tens of thousands of federal workers;
energetically ignored congressional statutes; boldly run roughshod over
the constitution; and fearlessly unleashed Elon Musk, the world's
richest man, in a slash-and-burn campaign against the US government.

**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** has done more than that -- he has
opened a Pandora's box that might, in time, give the chief justice
pause. The president [has indicated that he [**has** **another
target**]{.mark} in his sights**:**]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} very **[[judiciary]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[over which Roberts presides.]{.underline}

["He who saves his Country does not violate any law,"]{.underline} Trump
posted on Musk's X earlier this month, channeling Napoleon Bonaparte.
The comment, combined with [overt threats]{.underline} that
[Trump]{.underline} and his people [have made against judges who dare
stand in their]{.underline} way, have prompted a question that
previously would have been unthinkable: is the [**president** willing to
**defy** the **rule of law** itself]{.underline}?

"We've seen the many ways in which [Trump has sought to undermine
Congress, and now he's seeking to undermine the judicial
bench]{.underline}," said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard law school professor.
"This is a president who is arrogating to himself the powers of a
dictator."

For 17 years, until she retired in 2011, Gertner sat as a federal judge
in the district court of Massachusetts. There she dealt with the
defiance of individual defendants.

"I had people who had been sentenced and didn't follow the rules of
their release, for sure," she said.

Not once in almost two decades of service, however, did she have to
confront a public officeholder openly flouting her authority.
"Governmental officials defying the court? It never came up. Literally,
never happened."

Two men, one with a unique hairstyle and the other in a judge's robe,
shake hands and speak with each other while other people in judge's
robes gaze obsequiously at the person with the floofy hairdo.

Now [Gertner is observing Trump's belligerence towards the courts unfold
with mounting concern]{.underline}. "There's been nothing like this in
American history. There have been people who threatened not to obey the
law, especially post the civil war, but [[this is a **sustained
attack**]{.mark} on the courts [we **haven't seen
before**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Alarm bells began to ring just [a week into **[Trump's]{.mark}** second
term]{.underline} in the White House when [the office of management and
budget imposed an immediate **[funding freeze]{.mark}**]{.underline}
across the federal government. Th[e pause in funding, exceeding \$1tn in
grants to the 50 states alone, [was]{.mark} instantly
[challenged]{.mark} by several Democratic governors who succeeded in
persuading]{.underline} [[a judge]{.underline}]{.mark} [to]{.underline}
[[issue a]{.mark} temporary [restraining order]{.mark} demanding that
the money continue to flow.]{.underline}

The author of the restraining order, the chief judge in the federal
court of Rhode Island, John McConnell, could not have been more clear.
He pointed out that Congress, which under the US model holds the "power
of the purse", had assigned much of the money, and that Trump, as
executive, had no power to withhold it.

**[McConnell]{.underline}** [called the funding freeze "arbitrary and
capricious]{.underline}". He found that it violated the principle of the
separation of powers established in the constitution and negated the
"will of the people as expressed through congressional appropriations".

In normal times, that would have been that. The Trump administration
would duly have been chastised into suspending the funding freeze.

But [a week after]{.underline} McConnell issued his edict, something
strange happened. [[A]{.underline}]{.mark} program run by the
[[University]{.underline}]{.mark} of Washington that treats 250,000
people with HIV and has tested hundreds of thousands of women for
cervical cancer was informed that much of its [[grant was still
suspended.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The same]{.mark} story was reported [across numerous
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. In California, a \$500m federal award to
fight pollution in Los Angeles remained frozen days after the
restraining order was issued. A \$118m fund to monitor air quality
across states was still inaccessible, as was money for a scheme to help
low-income communities take up solar energy.

A pattern was emerging: the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration **[[was ignoring a]{.mark} federal [judge's unambiguous
instructions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When it was brought to
[McConnell]{.underline}'s notice, he was livid.

He [issued a second order]{.underline}, 10 days after the first,
[telling Trump and his appointees to immediately restore all frozen
funds]{.underline}. McConnell reminded the defendants, addressing them
as he might elementary schoolchildren, that [it was a "basic
proposition" that "all orders and judgments of courts must be complied
with promptly".]{.underline}

He added tartly that "persons who make private determinations of the law
and refuse to obey an order generally risk criminal contempt".

In the wake of McConnell's stern second order[, large sums of federal
money continue to be snarled up, causing ongoing disruption to vital
programs nationwide]{.underline}. The New York Times reported that
critical biomedical research on cancer and other illnesses remains
effectively stalled because of blockages imposed by Trump appointees in
apparent flagrant breach of the judge's command.

On Tuesday, [a]{.underline} second [judge complained that]{.underline}
the [Trump]{.underline} administration [had conspicuously ignored his
court order issued almost two weeks previously]{.underline}. Judge Amir
Ali set a deadline of 48 hours for the release of \$1.5bn worth of funds
that should have been distributed through the foreign assistance agency
USAid but was frozen in defiance of his word.

Trump has given mixed messages about his intentions in all this. He has
said that he will abide by court rulings, pledging to appeal those with
which he disagrees in time-honored fashion.

At the same time, he has made plain his displeasure at being
contradicted by judges. That sentiment has been amplified by the
vice-president, JD Vance, who notoriously stated that "judges aren't
allowed to control the executive's legitimate power".

At worst, the president and his deputy have introduced a note of menace
into the conversation. In recent comments from the Oval Office,
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} effectively [[warned]{.mark} the courts not
to interfere]{.underline} in what he claimed was his anti-corruption
agenda.

He implied that [if provoked [he would instigate]{.mark} **D**epartment

Exploiting Trump's Chaos ,\" Foreign Policy, https://archive.ph/bXQZy)

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration[['s]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**chaotic [effort]{.mark}** [to **overhaul** the]{.mark}]{.underline}
U.S. **[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**ederal
**[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**overnment and exert control [[has]{.mark}
**delighted** and]{.underline} even **[[emboldened
autocrats]{.underline}]{.mark}** around the world [[who see]{.mark} the
**[turmoil]{.mark}** in Washington [as an opportunity]{.mark} to
**[advance]{.mark}** their own **[crackdowns]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Slashing the federal workforce. Dismantling the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID). Freezing the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau. Purging independent government watchdogs. Targeting
funding at the National Institutes of Health. Cracking down on
diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Restricting scientists
at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Making sweeping
budget cuts at the Department of Education. Sidelining some independent
media.

In the past month, U.S. President Donald Trump and top advisor Elon
Musk's far-reaching joint effort to dramatically remake the federal
government has sown chaos in Washington and sparked a slew of lawsuits
against the administration. But abroad, [the moves are being closely
followed by **foreign strongmen**]{.underline}, [many of whom are eager
to harness the chaos to their own advantage.]{.underline}

Take, for example, Trump's foreign aid freeze and effective shutdown of
USAID, which has served for decades as the United States' top
humanitarian and development agency. [[Through]{.mark} foreign
**[aid]{.mark}**, [Washington has]{.mark} long [supported]{.mark}
**[civil society groups]{.mark}**]{.underline} around the
world---[including ones operating [in **repressive
environments**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as Russia, Hungary, and
China---and experts warn that [[**tearing down** that architecture is a
**boon** to those regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} and their own clampdowns.

The Trump [administration's]{.underline} dismantling of
[USAID]{.underline} "[has been **music to the ears** of autocratic
leaders in many places]{.underline}," said Thomas Carothers, a democracy
expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "[[They're
celebrating this demise of funding to these groups and the **chance to
attack them**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

One of the biggest cheerleaders of the effort has been Hungarian Prime
Minister Viktor Orban, a longtime Trump ally who has for years waged his
own campaign against nongovernmental organizations and independent
media, particularly targeting those that receive U.S. funding. On social
media and on state radio last week, the Hungarian strongman celebrated
Trump's gutting of USAID and claimed that the agency had backed
organizations that wanted to "topple" his government.

"I think the world owes a debt of gratitude to \[Trump\] for uncovering
and putting an end to this dark conspiracy," Orban said in a post on X.

As the Trump administration effectively shuttered the agency, which Musk
has baselessly labeled a "criminal organization," [**[Orban]{.mark}**
appeared to [use the turmoil]{.mark} last week [to **justify his own
crackdown**]{.mark}. Hungary will now take legal action against
NGOs]{.underline} and independent media organizations [that receive aid
from Washington]{.underline}, he announced last Friday, describing the
employees of USAID-funded groups as "agents."

"Now is the moment when these international networks have to be taken
down, they have to be swept away," he declared on state radio. "It is
necessary to make their existence legally impossible."

[Trump's and Musk's effort to dismantle USAID was also welcomed by
Iranian state media and Russian officials]{.underline}, with former
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev dubbing it a "smart move." Russia
expelled USAID from the country in 2012 after accusing it of attempting
"to influence political processes through its grants."

But Michael McFaul, who was the U.S. ambassador to Russia between 2012
and 2014, posted on X that Russian President Vladimir Putin kicked out
USAID "because their work supported free markets, democracy, human
rights." Those are "causes that threatened \[Putin's\] dictatorship," he
said.

"[Shutting down USAID is **exactly what autocrats**]{.underline} all
over the world **[want]{.underline}**," he added.

It's not just USAID's dissolution that is a cause for celebration for
Russia; [Putin is]{.underline} "[hoping]{.underline} that both
**[disruption]{.underline}** in the U.S. [will **consume** the U.S.
and]{.underline} it will **[undercut]{.underline}** U.S. [**support for
Ukraine** and]{.underline} U.S. support for [**democratic forces** in
Moldova, Georgia and elsewhere]{.underline}," Carothers said.

Unlike Budapest and Moscow, the Chinese government has been largely
quiet when it comes to the U.S. federal shake-up. Officials in Beijing
have been focused on thwarting a trade war that will have "no winners,"
a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.

"I think the Chinese are watching it almost in disbelief," said Yun Sun,
the director of the China program at the Stimson Center, who added that
she had seen policy analysts in China liken the chaos to the Cultural
Revolution.

"Given how the government agencies are being just written off and
completely gutted within days, I think that reminds Chinese of \[the\]
Cultural Revolution as the most comparable analogy in their recent
memories," she said.

[[The **funding freeze** has given China a chance to **spread its
influence**]{.mark} and portray itself as the more reliable
superpower]{.underline}. In one example, the Chinese government
announced it would give \$4.4 million to fund an effort previously
supported by USAID to clear mines from the countryside in Cambodia---a
legacy of the Vietnam War. However, experts doubt that China has the
will or capacity to fully replace the U.S. presence worldwide.

[Another front in Trump's campaign to downsize the government is also
delivering a win to Beijing]{.underline}, according to the human rights
community. [[Cuts in funding to the State Department's
**Democracy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Human Rights, and Labor
[**[Bureau]{.mark}**, which has long supported China-related human
rights work, have dealt a significant blow to nonprofits in the
space.]{.underline}

"[It'll be [a]{.mark} sweet [**victory** for]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[Chinese President\] **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping, [[who has
tried to **crush these groups**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Maya Wang, the
associate China director at Human Rights Watch, wrote on X.

The Trump administration's sweeping effort to target DEI programs across
the federal government may also draw cheers from leaders who have made
similar pushes in their own countries, experts said.

"The [attacks on DEI **resonate**]{.underline} strongly [in places where
illiberal leaders have]{.underline} already [advanced these kinds of
ideas, whether it's Russia or Hungary]{.underline}," said Carothers,
citing efforts to roll back LGBTQ rights or progress on gender equality.

"[They see it as part of their struggle, and they feel the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is **joining them** in
their struggle to move their countries in this direction]{.underline},"
he added.

B. Democracy and Representation

[**[Dem]{.mark}**ocratically elected governments [have been]{.mark}
**largely [ineffective]{.mark}** in [addressing **climate**]{.mark}
change, [as well as]{.mark} a **host** of other global problems and
their domestic implications]{.underline}. 38 [These include]{.underline}
(to varying degrees in different countries) [**[pollution]{.mark}** and
**[biod]{.mark}**iversity loss, **nuclear [waste]{.mark}** management,
nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration, **[cyber]{.mark}-(in)security**,
**[financ]{.mark}ial insecurity**, **business flight**, growing wealth
**[inequality]{.mark}**, public **[debt]{.mark} management**,
**[migration]{.mark}**, **intercultural [integration]{.mark}**[, and
**terror**]{.mark}**ist radicalization**. The supranational institutions
that]{.underline} these [governments]{.underline} have [created and
supported, like the **U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations
[and]{.underline} the **[E]{.underline}**uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion, [have not been]{.underline} particularly
[successful]{.underline} in addressing these issues either. 39

[In]{.underline} many [democratic countries, [citizens
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[frustrated with]{.mark}
the]{.underline} relatively [**[poor performances]{.mark}**
of]{.underline} their [governments]{.underline}, but also increasingly
resentful of institutions and procedures that they perceive as
inaccessible, arcane, [[**dominated** by **partisan interests**]{.mark},
crowded with **[rent-seekers]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} generally
[[**detached** and **unresponsive**]{.mark} to]{.underline} their
[needs]{.underline} and interests. 40

\[\*378\] A democratic deficit in many self-declared democracies has
vividly been put on display in cases in which [**majority
[preferences]{.mark}** have [**failed** to]{.mark} be
**[translate]{.mark}**d in[**to** policy]{.mark}. For example, in the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [for at least the last
twenty-five years, most]{.underline} Americans have [favored stricter
**gun control** laws, yet]{.underline} gun control [laws have
consistently been **weakened**]{.underline}. 41 In Italy, the outcomes
of many popular referenda, including those regarding the introduction of
legal liability for magistrates (1985, 80.2% in favor) and the abolition
of public funding for political parties (1993, 90% in favor), have been
ignored either flatly or through artful reformulation of existing
legislation. 42

### AT IRA Good Impact Turn

#### The IRA is [already dead]{.underline} from administrative actions. No one thinks funds will be dispersed.

**Jacobson 25**, M.P.P., and M.S. degrees from the University of
Michigan (Rachel, "With Federal Climate Funding at Risk, Policymakers
Should Protect Benefits for Those Most Impacted and With Fewest
Resources,"
https://www.cbpp.org/research/climate-change/with-federal-climate-funding-at-risk-policymakers-should-protect-benefits)

Administrative Threats to Federal Climate Funding

[[Recent administrative actions]{.underline}]{.mark} have directed
agencies to [[pause disbursement]{.mark} and contracting [of
IRA]{.mark}]{.underline} and IIJA [climate [funds]{.mark}]{.underline}.
On January 20, President Trump issued an executive order titled
"Unleashing American Energy," directing all agencies to immediately
pause disbursement of certain IRA and IIJA grants and loans.\[16\] On
January 27, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo to
all agencies directing them to freeze most federal grant and loan
programs.\[17\]

The funding freeze is being challenged through the legal system: two
federal courts ruled to temporarily block the freeze, and OMB has since
withdrawn its memo.\[18\] Still, the January 20 executive order has not
been rescinded, and there is much confusion around what the executive
order means for recipients of federal climate funding through the IRA
and IIJA.\[19\] For example, grantees of the Solar for All program ---
which provides grants for solar energy systems in low-income communities
--- have reportedly been unable to draw down obligated funds.\[20\]

These recent executive actions pose short- and long-term risks to
climate grants and loans across multiple stages of implementation.
[[Funding delays]{.underline}]{.mark} --- **[[even if only
temporary]{.mark}]{.underline}** while litigation is being resolved ---
can pose real [[harm]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[[projects]{.underline}]{.mark}, [calling their long-term viability into
question]{.underline}.\[21\]

[[**Even if** the funding freeze is]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually
**[[lifted]{.underline}]{.mark}** and disbursements resume, obligated
funding could also be threatened if [[agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}
attempt to [[end individual]{.mark} grant [awards by terminating]{.mark}
contracts]{.underline} with awardees. Such actions may or may not be
legally authorized, depending on the requirements to terminate awards
laid out in each contract.\[22\]

#### Uncertainty alone dooms the IRA

**Johnson 3-7**-2025 (Lamar, "IRA funding freeze has put 'many' clean
energy projects on pause," Utility Dive,
https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ira-funding-freeze-caused-clean-energy-projects-to-pause/741945/)

[[Though the E]{.mark}nvironmental [P]{.mark}rotection
[A]{.mark}gency]{.underline} announced this week it had
**[[unfroze]{.underline}]{.mark}**n **[[funds]{.underline}]{.mark}**
related to the Inflation Reduction Act's \$7 billion Solar for All
program, [[uncertainty]{.mark} about the program [created hesitancy
among]{.mark} solar [developers]{.mark}]{.underline} and prompted a
lawsuit from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Additionally, recipients of
the IRA's \$20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund have said the
freeze of its awarded funds endanger their operations and argue the
action is illegal.

Litigating the pauses may take time in court, [[the uncertainty]{.mark}
it's created for clean energy project developers [is "creating
turmoil"]{.mark}]{.underline} in the meantime, according to Steph
Speirs, co-founder and former CEO of community solar developer Solstice.

"Anytime there's **[[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the financial
model of these projects, that slows down building the projects that can
**[[scare investors away]{.underline}]{.mark}** from investing because
the return on their capital is uncertain," Speirs said on the call.

"[If you pull the public money, you'll see less private money come
in]{.underline}, because the public money is more risk taking and allows
for the private money to be mobilized for these projects," Speirs added.

Bates said [private [investors]{.mark}]{.underline} like banks and
investors **[[are "backing away]{.underline}]{.mark}** a little" [while
there is so much uncertainty]{.underline} around what the tax credit
environment will look like for clean energy projects. Speirs said while
"private money is going to flow no matter what,"
**[[few]{.underline}]{.mark}**er **[[projects will be
built]{.underline}]{.mark}** without the additional support from federal
programs.

Jon Powers, CEO of Clean Capital --- a renewable energy financier,
developer and operator --- said on the call that the industry has "grown
significantly" since the first time Trump was in office and is prepared
to help the nation meet the rising energy demands related to artificial
intelligence and its data center needs. However, he said
[[growth]{.mark} has been predicated on policy certainty, which [is
**currently in flux**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

call.

brakes**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} executives said on the Feb. 26
call coordinated by 501(c)4 Clean Energy for America. The nationwide
network advocates for boosting the clean energy economy and accelerating
the energy transition.

#### IRA fails\-\--siting and permitting, backlogged queues, supply chain challenges and no transmission

**Yglesias 24**, American blogger and journalist who writes about
economics and politics. Yglesias has written columns and articles for
publications such as The American Prospect, The Atlantic, and Slate. In
2014, he co-founded the news website Vox (Matthew, "How IRA results are
stacking up to predictions," Slow Boring,
https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-ira-results-are-stacking-up-to)

The problem, per Rhodium, is that [[zero-emissions electricity hasn't
been]{.mark} growing [enough to keep pace]{.mark} with IRAs
goals]{.underline}.

**[[Why]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that? Well, as Rhodium explains, the
problem is that even though the IRA provides large financial incentives
to deploy zero-emissions electricity, [[there are tons of]{.mark}
non-price [barriers]{.mark} to actually deploying]{.underline} it:

On the other hand, even though investment in utility-scale clean
electricity generation and storage capacity reached record levels in
2023, it is at risk of falling behind post-IRA projections. The IRA has
made renewable electricity cost-competitive with coal and natural gas
(short-term cost inflation in 2022/2023 and a lag in issuing guidance on
some tax credit provisions notwithstanding). [[The biggest]{.mark}
barriers to deployment]{.underline} between now and 2030 **[[are
non-cost]{.underline}]{.mark}** in nature---[[like siting and
permitting]{.mark} delays, [backlogged grid]{.mark} interconnect
[queues, and supply chain]{.mark} challenges]{.underline}. Tackling
these non-cost barriers will be critical for the IRA to achieve its full
clean energy deployment and emissions reduction potential.

Ooops! How did the modelers miss this? Well, it turns out they didn't
miss it. If you look at the REPEAT Project's models, for example, they
do, in fact, say that [[this is all contingent on a **gigantic
expansion** in]{.mark} transmission [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Warming impact is empirically denied by the [geological record]{.underline}. 

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective Altruism,
https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/)

But I will bite. I think Halstead is quite convincing in arguing that
the paleoclimate [[**data** does not give]{.underline}]{.mark} us good
[[reason to expect climate change to bring about]{.underline}]{.mark}
irreversible **[existential [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}** any time
soon, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[gives]{.mark} us [**good
reason** to expect]{.mark} that [it **won't**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The first thing to note is that [the earth has been **much
hotter**]{.underline} in the past [than even the most **dire** warming
projections]{.underline} predict it will soon become. [[During
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
(**[[PETM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) 55 million years ago, [[the earth
was]{.underline}]{.mark} an astounding
14-**[[17°]{.underline}]{.mark}**C [**[above]{.mark}** the
pre-industrial average, but **species extinctions** were
**limited**]{.underline}. Here is Halstead:

Overall, in the PETM, temperatures were upwards of 17°C higher than
pre-industrial levels and [the **only species** that went
extinct]{.underline} that we know of [was]{.underline} a
**[single-celled]{.underline}** marine organism, and [on land it was a
time of **ecological flourishing**]{.underline}, persistence and
diversity.

But if the scorching temperatures of the PETM did not lead to
existential catastrophe, [why believe that lower levels of warming will
now **destroy humanity**]{.underline}? We saw in Part 2 that even Ord
seems concerned by this thought:

The best argument against ... unknown mechanisms \[for extinction\] is
probably that [[the PETM]{.underline}]{.mark} \[Paleocene--Eocene
Thermal Maximum\] [[did **not** lead to a mass extinction, despite
temp]{.underline}]{.mark}erature[[s **rapidly
rising**]{.underline}]{.mark} about 5 degrees Celsius, [to
reach]{.underline} a level of **[14 degrees]{.underline}** Celsius above
pre-industrial temperatures.

Toby Ord, The precipice

However, Ord suggests that even though the PETM was hotter than the 21st
century will be, warming during the PETM was slower than the rapid
warming we are now experiencing:

Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred times
faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.

Toby Ord, The precipice

Fair enough. But Halstead has something to say about that too.

Citing Willis and MacDonald (2011), Halstead reminds us that [[we have
seen **rapid warming** before]{.underline}]{.mark}:

a\. [In **Greenland**]{.underline}, [temperatures]{.underline} may [have
risen]{.underline} by **[10°]{.underline}**C, though this may be an
error in climate proxies.

b\. [In [the **Swiss Alps**]{.mark}]{.underline} and other parts of
Europe, a [warming of]{.underline} 2 to **[5°]{.underline}**C [appears
to have occurred in 200 years or less]{.underline}.

c\. [In the **[Sierra Nevada]{.mark}**]{.underline} of California,
[rates of warming in the late glacial may have been]{.underline} 4 to
**[5°]{.underline}**C every 500 years [around 15,000 years
ago.]{.underline}

d\. At the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, [there were
increases of 5°C and more over a **few decades**]{.underline} (11,700
years ago).

e\. [Data from [**Greenland** ice cores]{.mark}
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that a \>[**[10°]{.mark}**C
[warming]{.mark} may have [occurred over]{.mark}]{.underline} 20 to
**[[6 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

f\. In California, warming at the close of the Younger Dryas (13,000
years ago) may have been on the order of 3°C in less than 100 to 200
years.

g\. For the entire Southwest US, a general warming of 4°C may have
occurred in less than a century (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

Halstead, Climate change and longtermism

Just as [[history gives us **abundant ev**]{.underline}]{.mark}idence
[[of]{.mark} large mammals [**surviving** temperatures
**hotter**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[than]{.mark} the earth is projected to
be]{.underline} by 2100, [history also gives us evidence of survival at
rates of warming comparable to the **[worst-case scenarios]{.mark}** in
the IPCC report]{.underline}.

[Even the worst-looking scenarios give **cause for
comfort**]{.underline}. For example, [[in]{.mark} the beginning of [the
**Holocene**]{.mark}]{.underline} (\~10,000 BCE), climate change did
seem to play a role in the extinction of megafauna (large animals). But
there is little evidence of plant extinctions, and many megafauna
survived. In particular, Halstead notes, [[humans]{.mark} **lived**,
and]{.underline} by all appearances **[[thrived]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[during this time]{.underline}. And as for the megafauna who perished, a
live scientific hypothesis is the overkill hypothesis: they died because
we killed and ate them. (Halstead assigns this 90% credence, but notes
that many scientists may be closer to 50%). All of this gives us every
reason for confidence that [[**today's** humans, with]{.mark} greater
numbers, **[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology, [[and
**forewarning**]{.underline}]{.mark} than our ancestors, [[can
**survive**]{.mark} ongoing **climate catastrophe**.]{.underline}

We saw in Part 2 that the only sustained argument which Ord makes in
favor of climate risk is his discussion of unknown mechanisms in the
context of paleoclimate. But, if Halstead is right to suggest that the
paleoclimate data gives us every reason for confidence in humanity's
survival, then we should not have much confidence in Ord's argument.

#### Climate wars are [debunked]{.underline} by large-N datasets\-\--[cooperation]{.underline}'s more likely 

**Warner 23**, PhD, Associate Professor of Crisis and Disaster Studies
at Wageningen University and Research. (Jeroen Frank, 10-5-2023,
"Rethinking the link between climate and violent conflict over water,"
International Development Planning Review, Volume 45, Number 4, p.
383-386, https://doi.org/10.3828/idpr.2023.15)

As climate itself is a heady mix of anthropogenic forcing and chaotic
behaviour, we still cannot speak with great confidence about how the
system will respond to greenhouse emissions past, present and future;
event attribution is fiendishly difficult (e.g. Stott et al., 2016).
Climate crisification is based on scenarios about what could go wrong --
which is where policy comes in. [The implications of climate hazards on
overall stability and security however are largely indirect,
multidimensional and changing over time]{.underline} (Adger et al.,
2014). It is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition and may not
even be the most important source of violence (Ide and Scheffran, 2012).
According to Barnett and Adger (2007), environmental degradation caused
by climate change undermines human security, therefore raising
grievances and lowering opportunity costs for violent behaviour. [The
**most likely** forms climate change-induced conflicts will
take]{.underline}, they claim, [are **small-scale**, **subnational
conflicts** in **poor**]{.underline}, undemocratic [**regions** with a
**history of violence**]{.underline} and low climate change-related
adaptive capacity. Aggression is caused in large part by the negative
emotions of the actors towards someone or society or system as they
experience stressful events (Berkowitz and Heimer (1989). However, as
Raleigh et al. (2014) have pointedly put it, [[it is **outrageous** to
assume]{.mark} that [**hotter weather** makes people]{.mark} **more
[aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, [warmer spells have seen
less violence than cold spells]{.underline} (Tertrais, 2011).

While Hsiang et al.'s (2013) meta-analysis confidently claims to find
strong evidence between climate and conflict, Salehyan (2014) more
realistically notes that despite the alarmism in the media, the academic
field on this is still underdeveloped.

Recently, studies have come out warning of violence induced not by
climate but by climate adaptation (Eriksen et al., 2021). The Dutch
Clingendael think tank argued there will be more conflict potential due
to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The drive to comply with climate
goals can have serious collateral damage, such as displacement. Apart
from maladaptation, it sees 'adaptation conflict' notably due to the
increase in hydropower production and biofuel production (Vivekananda et
al., 2017). The German think tank Adelphi has developed design criteria
for 'conflict-sensitive adaptation' (Tänzler et al., 2013).

The water wars thesis predicts war between states or communities as
increasing scarcity leads to violent competition; an existential threat
to states legitimising extraordinary actions. For classical realists in
international relations, the world is anarchic, and states will only
cooperate, and respect treaties, if their security is secured (Leb,
2009). For realist analysts, water can't be high politics, although some
have expanded security to include environmental security. But that
doesn't exclude for water to be instrumentalised. Almost every war,
including the occupation of the Crimea in 2014 and very recently near
Kherson, Ukraine, has seen tactical violence against water
installations. An emerging concern is that of the weaponisation of
water, whether in the form of hydro-terrorism or of water being taken
hostage by rebels. Those engaged in civil war have targeted
infrastructure or have taken dams hostage. There also appears to be some
evidence that engineers and water infrastructure have been targeted in
secretive 'proxy war' operations in enemy territory. This is however not
a fight over water, but a fight using water.

Water peace: water wars won't happen?

The above Malthusian climate wars thesis has been countered by an
optimistic Cornucopian counternarrative. This idealist/institutionalist
counterfactual assumes [[water wars]{.mark} **don't/[won't
happen]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or at least don't need to happen. This
environmental peace perspective suggests that [[environmental
problems]{.underline}]{.mark} exacerbated by climate change are not
sources of conflict; they [are]{.underline} not problems but
[opportunities and [can]{.mark} even [be **catalysts for
coop**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration between individuals and groups (Ide
and Scheffran, 2016; Abrahams and Carr, 2017; Abukhater, 2013). As water
is life, this reasoning holds, it must inevitably lead to cooperation
rather than conflict. Individual and social responses to rising resource
competition can not only cause conflict but also lead to adaptive
migration, technological innovation and cooperation.

Water pessimism fell out of fashion for some time around the turn of the
century, when environmental modernisation became the dominant discourse,
arguing that [reaching [environmental limits make]{.mark}]{.underline}s
[[societies switch to]{.mark} **more [rational ways]{.mark}** [of
**dealing with**]{.mark}]{.underline} water [**[scarcity]{.mark}**, i.e.
**[demand management]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Ohlsson and Turto,
1999). Based on a large historic database, Basins at Risk, Aaron Wolf
and his Oregon co-workers showed that [[water wars haven't broken out
for]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[[2,500 years]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
**[[coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [[is the
**norm**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Like others, Wolf proposes to zoom in on
transboundary basins as integrated ecosystems, overriding political
boundaries and sovereignty, and on that basis identify needs in
depoliticising water in the process, in this literature the importance
of mutual trust building and 'desecuritisation' is often foregrounded,
as securitisation freezes adversarial relations and sharply reduces
potential 'win-sets' (Rigi and Warner, 2020). [**Countless** projects
and trainings were developed to move transboundary basin relations from
**conflict** to **coop**]{.underline}eration. Cooperation over
transboundary water, it was held, presents possibilities for development
cooperation beyond water (Sadoff and Grey, 2002): peace in the water
domain is expected to be the starting point for further peacemaking in
other domains and in promoting regional integration. [The Senegal River
Development Organisation]{.underline} is held up as an exemplar of
transboundary river benefit sharing (Cooper, 2021). Joint investment has
[led to multiple]{.underline} '**[friendship dams]{.underline}**', and
the confidence gained by transboundary cooperation has been hailed as a
driver for peacemaking (e.g. Wolf, 2004).

To be sure, in 2018 3.6 billion people had inadequate access to water at
least one month per year, an unconscionable human rights infringement.
There is however no absolute shortage of water; we make it (seem)
scarce: it was already noted at the 2nd World Water Forum in The Hague
(2000) that there is enough water to go round; it is poor water
governance (especially distribution and access) that creates local
scarcities, suffering and tensions. In this sense mitigation of conflict
potential would seem to be within reach. As Allan (1997, 1) noted: 'The
optimists are right but dangerous, the pessimists are wrong but useful
because they bring attention to the issue'. Not all of the 'optimistic'
assumptions in his schema have so far been borne out. It doesn't help
that a current water optimism campaign is spearheaded by the chemicals
multinational Dupont, who gave us per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(PFAS) and covered up its toxicity (Richter et al., 2021). There is
however reason for some optimism. While some forecasts model a global
population growth increase to 13 billion by 2100, others predict a
levelling off in the 2060s (Adam, 2021). [The rate of poverty, violent
conflicts and deadly disaster victims is **trending down**]{.underline}.
The mass availability of remote sensing data and ICTs obviates the need
to desecuritise water and weather information.

While institutionalists are not entirely sure water wars won't ever
happen, they see institutions, 'social resources' (Ohlsson and Turton,
1999), ingenuity and/or technology as the drivers for these turns for
the positive. Conflict, it is argued, will happen after sudden shocks
that the institutions cannot accommodate. As climate change is expected
to exacerbate shocks and stresses to the system, institutionalists
propose to increase institutional adaptivity to shocks (both shocks to
social infrastructure and between states). European institutions have
been put up as an example, having been explicitly designed to rein in
excesses of power to prevent a repeat of the tyrannies of the past,
though it should be noted that cooperation, such as with the river Rhine
Action Plan of 1987, is often triggered by crises and shocks (Kaufmann
et al., 2016). Institutionalists believe by clarifying entitlements to
resources, exclusion can be counteracted, after Amartya Sen's
capabilities approach, whose starting point is the lack of access to
strategic resources (Sen, 1993).

This line of thought is often constructivist, rejecting the materialist
assumptions underlying both the Malthusian and critical (Marxist)
strands. It recognises that people ascribe meaning to others and to
objects, that these meanings are not fixed, and may change this
meaning-giving. This meaning can elevate water to an unassailable
national interest, as history plays a role in the mythmaking of national
identity and interest formation. Yet, when circumstances change, this
attribution can also be undone. It thus sees a possibility for actors to
change their identity and their perception of the problem, turning
enmity into friendship and conflict into cooperation. A constructivist
view also takes seriously that 'scarcity' and 'crisis' are constructs,
and can be reconstructed. Stetter et al. (2011) give the example of the
'new water culture' in Spain putting a stop to water scarcity as an
existential threat. Where this has not happened, as on the Nile, water
may still remain at the level of an issue conflict rather than escalate
into violence. [Faced with the **prospect of crisis**, even [hostile
parties]{.mark} may [**work together** if they face a **common
environmental threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [affecting]{.underline} the
well-being of [each party]{.underline}. [This
**coop**]{.underline}eration [can **prevent**]{.underline} the outbreak
of [**hostilities** and increase mutual trust]{.underline}, eventually
transforming the (adverse) identities of the groups involved (Ide and
Scheffran, 2016). There is of course no certainty that the
reinterpretation (and transformation) of conflict and identity won't go
the other way!

Julien (2013) laments the tendency to hydrocentric thinking making the
conceptual jump from water being essential to life to water being the
determinant of all decision-making and politics, let alone the bone of
inevitable contention between states. Lopez-Gunn et al. (2013) and
others have moreover argued conflict analyses are too water-centric, as
the majority of problems are neither created nor solved within the water
domain. [Many water conflicts are not even **about** water]{.underline}
(Warner and Vij, 2021; Roth et al., 2021; Wateau, 2000), rather, [they
are **symbolic** of other issues]{.underline} and may escalate in the
context of wider socio-political conflict.
