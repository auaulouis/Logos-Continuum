China's cautious yet persistent presence

[[China has]{.mark} long [eyed Greenland as]{.mark}]{.underline} part of
its [[Arctic economic strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its 2018 Arctic
Policy White Paper declared China as "Arctic stakeholder" and
highlighted scientific research, infrastructure, energy and mineral
development as key interests. [Chinese firms, such as Shenghe
Resources]{.underline} and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC),
[have attempted to invest in Greenlandic mining]{.underline}, notably in
the Kvanefjeld and Isua Iron Ore Project Mine.

However, these [efforts have encountered political
headwinds]{.underline}. [Greenland's]{.underline} 2021 [uranium ban was
widely interpreted as a rebuke to Chinese involvement.]{.underline} In
2019, Danish intelligence reportedly warned that China sought to
establish dual-use infrastructure in Greenland that could serve
strategic or military purposes. This has increased Western wariness
about Chinese investment.

Nonetheless, [[China remains engaged in Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Its [[firms continue to hold minority stakes in]{.mark}]{.underline}
certain [[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} and explore partnerships.
Beijing's global Belt and Road Initiative and growing Arctic diplomacy
make Greenland a continued focal point for resource diplomacy. As global
demand for REEs intensifies, China may recalibrate its strategy ---
balancing commercial interest with lower-profile engagement to avoid
geopolitical friction.

Despite these constraints, [[Greenland has signalled]{.mark}
a]{.underline} pragmatic [[openness to Chinese
investment]{.mark},]{.underline} warning that "if the US and EU do not
act, [we may turn to Chinese investment]{.underline}". This reflects
Nuuk's realist approach to foreign engagement --- China remains a viable
partner, provided it adheres to Greenland's conditions, including
respect for sovereignty, environmental safeguards, and transparency.

Greenland welcomed the EU's initiative, but Nathanielsen noted that the
bloc has yet to translate its intentions into tangible investments.

The EU's green demand and regulatory leverage

The EU pursues a different path --- leveraging rules and norms to
project soft power. Its 2020 Critical Raw Materials Action Plan and 2023
Critical Raw Materials Act aim to diversify and secure sustainable
mineral supplies. Greenland, with its close historical ties to Denmark,
is seen as a key non-Chinese source of rare earths in the EU's strategic
calculus.

Unlike the US security-driven model, the EU emphasises environmental
protection, corporate social responsibility and Indigenous consultation.
The 2023 EU-Greenland MOU on Sustainable Raw Materials Value Chains
outlines cooperation on feasibility studies, environmental assessments,
and local stakeholder engagement.

Greenland welcomed the EU's initiative, but Nathanielsen noted that the
bloc has yet to translate its intentions into tangible investments. What
Greenland needs, she stressed, are real partners --- not just verbal
commitments.

Geopolitical and environmental implications

Greenland's mining politics encapsulate broader Arctic shifts. [[As
great powers increase]{.mark} their economic
[footprints]{.mark},]{.underline} the [[island becomes a proxy arena for
strategic competition]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[US-China rivalry is
increasingly mirrored]{.underline}]{.mark} in resource diplomacy, while
the EU acts as a normative power pushing environmental safeguards.

This dynamic raises two concerns. First, [[Greenland may become
over-politicised]{.underline}]{.mark}. As its autonomy within the
Kingdom of Denmark grows, Nuuk seeks to chart its own economic path. Yet
external pressure risks reducing Greenlandic agency, especially if
caught in US-China tension.

The [[Greenland]{.mark}ic governments have been **[welcom]{.mark}**ing
to [Chinese investment in their territory]{.mark} with high hopes
(Zeuthen & Raftopoulos, 2018, p. 122). [China]{.mark} has taken steps to
[**protect** its interest in the High North, notably in]{.mark} Iceland,
Svalbard, and in **[Greenland]{.mark}** (Connolly, 2017, p.
8).]{.underline} Publicly such high interest is suppressed, but [since
2016 there has been [**increasing** mentions of Greenland by]{.mark} the
[Chinese scholars]{.mark} (Andersson et al., 2018, p. 105).]{.underline}
Notably, China corporated the Arctic to its plans on Maritime
Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative in its envisioned "blue
economic passage" which links Europe and China via the Arctic Ocean
(Connolly, 2017, p. 8). [The key component of [China's Arctic policy is
to establish]{.mark} [**strong** bilateral relationships with the Arctic
states]{.mark} and stakeholders [gradually **increasing** Chinese
**influence** in the]{.mark} multilateral institutions dealing with
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sorensen, 2018, p. 84). [[Greenland's
value in China's eyes is a source to import **essential** minerals
and]{.mark} to [have a foothold]{.mark} for Arctic access.]{.underline}
The Chinese state is building an Arctic knowledge which can be analysed
to facilitate investment in Greenland in the future, as well as support
China's full participation in the Arctic matters. (Andersson et al.,
2018, p. 113).

[[Greenland]{.mark} is expected to [play a **crucial** role in China's
emerging Arctic strategy]{.mark} because of its proximity to the Arctic
shipping passages and potential for mineral resource
exploration]{.underline}, but this evaluation is based on academic
guesses. The main condition for more significant Chinese economic
commitment is the energy and resource prices together with the cost of
exploration and extraction, which needs to be economically more
favourable. Also, greater agreements between China and Greenland
requires reassurance and support from Copenhagen. (Sorensen, 2018, p.
88). In general, China has operated in the Arctic carefully, and it is
still an open question of how strong of a partner would China become
with Greenland (Sorensen, 2018, p. 90). [There is an additional United
States component, since it is Denmark's strategically closest ally and
has a long-standing vision for the military-strategic presence in
Greenland,]{.underline} as is also the purpose of the Thule Air Space.
Therefore, [a greater presence of China in Greenland is monitored
closely by the United States.]{.underline} (Sorensen, 2018, p. 84;
Dadwal, 2014, p. 816). Zeuhen and Raftopoulos (2018) analyse the
situation that the idea of Chinese coordinated approach has mainly been
created by the competitive approach of contradictory images presented by
the governments of Greenland and Denmark when promoting their interest.
(Zeuthen & Raftopoulos, 2018, p. 122). Also, [[the development of
the]{.mark} [Arctic governance **interests** China]{.mark}]{.underline}
since it is a question of distinguishing international and national
waters, which has an impact on the position China has in the Arctic.

### AT: China Not Involved\-\--2NC

#### China and Greenland have [close]{.underline} economic ties

Flemming **Christiansen 25**, a mining and geology consultant with a
focus on new research and exploration projects in Greenland, IEEE
Spectrum, 5/8/25, "Can Geopolitics Unlock Greenland's Critical Materials
Treasure Chest?"
https://spectrum.ieee.org/greenland-rare-earth-minerals, igo

After the Trump administration touched off a tariff war, the
geopolitical skirmishing between the United States and China over rare
earths became a much more complicated conflagration involving the United
States, the European Union, and China.

And the Greenland government has continued to fan the flames by courting
Chinese investment. In March, for example, [[Greenland's foreign
minister]{.mark}, Vivian Motzfeldt]{.underline}, reportedly [[identified
closer cooperation with China]{.underline}]{.mark} as a priority,
[and]{.underline} even [touted the possibility of a free trade agreement
between Greenland and China.]{.underline} According to a report in The
Diplomat, Motzfeldt's actions were "largely driven by the belief...that
a mining boom, fueled by Chinese investment, was the most realistic path
toward independence from Denmark---a goal shared by most Greenlandic
parties." Maybe so, but such moves have been widely perceived as a
provocation against Denmark and the United States. Whatever their
motivation, they **[[could]{.mark} very well [lead to increased U.S.
pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [For the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [it would be a [geostrategic nightmare if China
opened a mine]{.mark} in a remote part of Greenland]{.underline}, with a
town, communication lines, harbor, and an airfield that could obviously
be used for purposes other than resource extraction and export.

Since Greenland took control of its mineral resources, Denmark has been
reluctant to get involved in mining projects. That could very well
change. Denmark and the E.U. may come under pressure to invest in
much-needed infrastructure and energy projects and offer loans on more
favorable conditions, if for no other reason than to keep the United
States at bay.

Though the situation is highly unstable, it's important to try, at
least, to separate the geopolitical posturing from the realities of
mining. In that vein, it's safe to say there will be no operating rare
earth mines in Greenland during the term of Donald J. Trump.

#### China is NOT leaving Greenland

Marc **Jacobsen** et al, 20**24**, Associate Professor at Royal Danish
Defense College, 2/13/24, "Greenland in Arctic security:
(De)securitization Dynamics under Climatic Thaw and Geopolitical
Freeze," https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12676130, igo

[[Chinese interest in Greenland **has grown**]{.mark} in the past
decade.]{.underline} [[Examples include investments]{.underline} [in
potential]{.underline}]{.mark} [[mining projects]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Andersson, Zeuthen, and Kalvig 2018), a bid by a large state-owned
company to assist in the refurbishment of airports (Simpson 2018;
Sejersen, chap. 9, this vol.), [and a]{.underline} controversial
[attempt by a Chinese mining company to acquire an]{.underline}
abandoned [Danish naval base]{.underline} (Breum 2016) to facilitate its
activities in Greenland. [[Greenland's rich mineral deposits
have]{.underline}]{.mark} been a focus [of [Chinese
interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2016, a Chinese company partly owned
by a subdivision of China Geological Survey invested in one of
Greenland's potential rare earth projects, the Kuannersuit (Kvanefjeld)
project. Rare earth elements, often referred to as the 'vitamins of
modern industry,' are considered essential in the EU, the United States,
China, Japan, and many other countries because of their importance in
producing a wide range of high-tech products, including advanced
communications and consumer technologies, emerging 'green' technologies,
and advanced military weapons. Then, in 2017, [[Chinese activities in
the Arctic]{.mark} [received a]{.mark}n]{.underline} additional
[[boost]{.underline} [when the region was]{.underline}]{.mark}
[officially **[incorporated into the]{.mark} Belt and Road Initiative
([BRI)]{.mark}**---[China's]{.mark}]{.underline} signature [[foreign
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} and strategy for international
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}---with the introduction of a 'Polar
Silk Road.' As discussed by Jacobsen and Olsvig (chap. 4, this vol.),
the U.S. has responded with a series of exceptional measures aimed at
countering Chinese influence in Greenland, measures that point to a
resecuritization of the country in U.S. politics. Although attempts at
securitizing U.S. interests in Greenland are shaped in part by
perceptions of China's Arctic strategy and security agenda in the
region, [very little is known about the degree to which Greenland or the
Arctic]{.underline} more broadly [are]{.underline} in fact [viewed as
security priorities in Chinese politics]{.underline}. Vuori (2008) has
argued that in the Chinese context, securitization, that is, the
justification of extraordinary political intervention to mitigate a
potential threat, is reserved for issues that are perceived as
existential threats to the survival of the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP). It would not appear that anything close to this would emerge from
conflicts in or about Greenland in any near future. This, however, does
not mean that Chinese engagement in Greenland is not enabled by forms of
policymaking that are framed as exceptional in China's authoritarian
system.

While the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has been]{.underline}
relatively [[slow to recognize Greenland]{.mark}'s
importance]{.underline}, [[Russia and China have been more
proactive.]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's Arctic ambitions are evident in
its extensive military build-up, which includes the establishment of new
airbases, missile installations, and icebreaker fleets. These
developments pose a direct threat to Greenland and, by extension, to
U.S. and NATO interests in the region.

China's approach, though less overtly militaristic, is no less
concerning. [[Through]{.mark} its Belt and Road Initiative
([BRI]{.mark}), [Beijing has sought to integrate Arctic]{.mark}
infrastructure [into its]{.mark}]{.underline} global [[economic
network]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Chinese companies
have]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly [[attempted to **invest in
Greenland's mining**]{.underline}]{.mark}, energy, and transportation
sectors, often with financial terms that could lead to economic
dependency. If successful, these efforts would give China a strategic
foothold in the Arctic, undermining U.S. influence and creating
vulnerabilities in Western supply chains.

The [United States must]{.underline} adopt a multi-pronged strategy to
counter these threats. First, it should enhance its military presence in
Greenland and the broader Arctic region, ensuring that NATO's northern
flank remains secure. Second, it must work with Greenland and Denmark to
block Chinese investments that pose a risk to national security.
Finally, the U.S. should [invest in]{.underline} Arctic research and
development, infrastructure, and [**resource exploration** to strengthen
its position as a leader]{.underline} in the region.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [controls more territory [in the
Arctic Circle]{.mark} than any other country, [sees that part of the
world as **critical** to]{.mark} its [own national
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} for the same reasons. In his speech,
[Putin referenced Russia's need for trade routes through the Arctic and
its]{.underline} role [as a]{.underline} critical hub [of oil and
natural gas production]{.underline}. In recent years, [[Putin
has]{.mark} [grown **increasingly** concerned about]{.mark} what he
considers to be [the West's **encroachment** on Russia's influence in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. He was [particularly frustrated when
Finland and Sweden joined NATO in 2023 and 2024,
respectively.]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}, which shares an
800-mile border with Finland, [called the country's admittance to NATO
a]{.underline} mistake[.]{.underline}

"The [[role and **importance** of the Arctic for Russia]{.mark} and for
the entire world are obviously **[growing]{.mark}**," Putin
said]{.underline}. "Regrettably, [the [geopolitical **competition** and
**fighting**]{.mark} for positions [in]{.mark} this [region]{.mark} are
also [**escalating**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Owing to the Arctic Circle's growing importance in global geopolitics,
[Putin was unsurprised the U.S. was angling for more influence in the
region.]{.underline}

"The [United States has serious plans regarding Greenland," [Putin
said]{.mark}]{.underline} in his speech. "[These plans have long
historical roots ... and [it is obvious that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will continue to]{.mark} consistently [advance]{.mark}
[its geo-strategic, military-political, and economic interests in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}."

The U.S. first took an interest in acquiring Greenland in 1867. Shortly
after completing the purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire,
then--Secretary of State William Seward set his sights on acquiring
Greenland from Denmark. The two countries never reached an agreement.
Later, after World War II, President Harry Truman offered Denmark \$100
million in gold and a portion of Alaskan oil. That offer was rebuffed.

[During World War II, the U.S. had several military bases in
Greenland]{.underline} that surveilled the Axis powers and were meant to
be a first line of defense against any potential westward expansion on
their behalf. [The U.S. continues to maintain bases in
Greenland]{.underline}.

[Putin alluded]{.underline} to the possibility [that [if the U.S. were
to take control of Greenland, it would **escalate** tensions with
Russia]{.mark}. He accused NATO countries of using the Arctic as a
"springboard for possible conflicts."]{.underline}

[[Kremlin spokesman]{.underline}]{.mark} Dmitry Peskov has [[said Russia
is **closely monitoring** the situation]{.underline},
[after]{.underline}]{.mark} US President-elect Donald [[Trump refused to
rule out]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[action to take
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} from Denmark.

Peskov said the [[Arctic was in Russia\'s **\"sphere of**]{.mark}
**national** and strategic [**interests** and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[it
is interested in]{.mark} peace and [stability]{.mark}
there\".]{.underline}

Trump\'s remarks on Greenland - a largely autonomous Danish territory -
have drawn a warning from European leaders.

[EU foreign affairs chief]{.underline} Kaja Kallas has [stressed that
\"we have to respect the]{.underline} territorial integrity and
[**sovereignty** of Greenland]{.underline}\", and Germany\'s Olaf Scholz
has made clear that \"borders must not be moved by force\".

Earlier this week Donald Trump Jr amplified his father\'s claims with a
private visit to Greenland

Trump said earlier this week that the US needed both Greenland and the
Panama Canal \"for economic security\", and refused to rule out using
either economic or military force in taking them over.

He also referred to the border with Canada as an \"artificially drawn
line\". Denmark and Canada are both close Nato allies of the US.

Dmitry [[Peskov]{.underline} [said]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump\'s claims
were a matter for the US, Denmark and other nations, but [Russia was
watching the]{.underline} \"rather [dramatic]{.underline}\"
[situation]{.underline} surrounding his remarks. \"[[We are **present**
in the Arctic]{.mark} zone, [and we will continue to be present]{.mark}
there]{.underline},\" he said.

Outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to dampen concern
about the president-elect\'s remarks during a visit to Paris: \"The idea
is\... obviously not a good one, but maybe more important, it\'s
obviously one that\'s not going to happen.\"

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy also played down Trump\'s comments, but
he acknowledged the \"intensity of his rhetoric and the unpredictability
sometimes of what he said can be destabilising\".

About [56,000 people live in Greenland, and]{.underline} it is home to
US as well as Danish military bases. [It]{.underline} also [has
considerable]{.underline} untapped [mineral]{.underline} and oil
[wealth]{.underline}.

Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede has been pushing for independence,
although the territory\'s economy relies heavily on Danish subsidies.

Both he and the Danish leader have emphasised that it is \"not for
sale\" and that its future is in the hands of Greenlanders themselves.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said Copenhagen has a clear
interest in ensuring that the US - \"absolutely its closest ally\" -
plays a key role at a time of rising tensions in the North Atlantic,
particularly involving Russia.

Facing a major foreign policy crisis, she has called a meeting of other
political parties at her office on Thursday evening.

[The E]{.underline}uropean [C]{.underline}ommission [said Trump\'s
threat to Greenland was \"extremely theoretical\"]{.underline} and
\"wildly hypothetical\", considering he was not yet in office.

However, it has confirmed that Greenland, as an overseas territory, does
come under a mutual assistance clause requiring all EU states to come to
its aid in case of attack.

Trump\'s Greenland rhetoric destabilising, says Lammy

Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Germany and France warn Trump over threat to take over Greenland

[[The Kremlin ridiculed the European response]{.underline}, [suggesting
it was]{.underline}]{.mark} reacting \"**[[very

Stymied by Definition

Facing these trade war actions, [Congress did **little**]{.underline} in
its waning days before adjourning [to address economic and national
defense priorities it had deliberated the last two years]{.underline}.

[It left a parcel of bills related to]{.underline} overall [**energy
development** on the table]{.underline}, including measures that can
streamlined the permitting process despite a pan-industry, bipartisan
rally cry.

Most notably idling for more than a year was HR 1, The Lower Energy
Costs Act, essentially a blueprint for a House GOP "drill baby drill"
energy policy that the Democrat-led Senate never heard in committee.

The proposed Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024---co-sponsored by
Sens. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and lauded by
energy and mining associations as a good first machete hack into the
regulatory thicket---died unheard in the House.

[A **significant component** of hearings was dedicated to getting the
Department of Energy (**DOE**) and **USGS** on the **same page** in
defining **what is a critical mineral** and how the federal government
should]{.underline} comprehensively [assess sources, supply chains, and
end-uses in developing a strategy]{.underline}.

Among bills seeking to define critical minerals, HB 8446, [The Critical
Mineral Consistency Act]{.underline} of 2024, advanced the furthest.

Sponsored by six Republicans led by Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), it
amends The Energy Act of 2020 to require the Interior secretary to
submit an annual report comprehensively assessing all global critical
mineral and rare earth element resources and to harmonize minerals
definitions and listings used by the DOE and the USGS.

It [spiraled into]{.underline} boxed canyon [**partisanship** by
including **copper** as a critical mineral, which Democrats objected to
as a "gift to the copper industry]{.underline} and the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP)," noting Resolution Copper, owned by Rio Tinto, a global
mining corporation, is proposing a copper mine in New Mexico.

"And guess who owns the largest stake in Rio Tinto?" Rep. Jared Huffman
(D-Calif.) asked. "The Chinese government."

HB 8446 was among the bills the House Rules Committee moved to the floor
on Nov. 12. The proposal passed the House on Nov. 14 in a 245-155 vote
and was never heard in the Senate where the copper inclusion nixed its
passage.

The [U.S. House passed a bill Wednesday to counter an Interior

[Republicans say weighs environmental concerns too heavily]{.underline}
at the expense of economic opportunity.

But the [[Republican majority]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[suffered a
setback on the House floor]{.mark}. Democrats, with the help of six
conservative Republicans, killed a separate bill seen as benefiting the
mining industry]{.underline} because it would have made it easier for
companies to develop sites that lack a documented mineral deposit.

The votes marked the second straight day the Republican-led chamber
focused on messaging bills on public lands and natural resources issues,
emphasizing an election-year theme that President Joe Biden's energy and
conservation policies are out of touch with rural voters.

[["How much of our land do we have to lock up and say, 'You can't have

[Bruce Westerman said. "[And]{.mark} it seems like]{.underline} as time
goes on[, [the answer is, 'We want]{.mark} [to lock all of it
up]{.mark}.'"]{.underline}

Westerman, of Arkansas, and other [Republicans argued that environmental
and labor standards are higher in the U.S. and blocking domestic mining
and fossil fuel development only pushes the industry to countries with
worse standards]{.underline}.

[[**Democrats** said]{.mark} [Republican]{.mark} [lawmakers]{.mark}
appeared to be [working to help industry instead of]{.mark} focusing on

said.]{.underline}

"It's as if Republicans were sitting in the front row with the popcorn
in their hands, leaning over to ask their oil and gas buddies what they
needed," Huffman said.

#### Trump's interest may boost short-term political momentum, but Greenland's harsh terrain, labor limits, and investor fears ensure mining hype won't translate into lasting success.

settlements, while the floating sea ice off the coast makes shipping
treacherous. The island's population of around 57,000 people likely
means importing foreign workers.

Greenland's decision to ban mining for uranium in recent years also
spooked some investors, who want to see successful projects come to

the Ukraine Mineral Deal Into Real Security,"

Whether the Ukraine deal is eventually signed or not, [[incorporating
minerals into]{.mark} foreign [policy is]{.mark}]{.underline} crucial
for U.S. national security. However, without [[**dedicating**
government]{.mark} investment and **[diplomatic
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [as China has done]{.underline} ---
this initiative remains a hollow effort and may fail to deliver any
results.

With less than 2 percent of the world's reserves of rare earths,
graphite, cobalt and nickel, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[must **work closely**]{.mark} [with
resource-rich nations]{.mark}]{.underline} to make sure American
companies can get the minerals they need to build, among other things,
phones, batteries for electric vehicles and semiconductors. [[China
has]{.underline}]{.mark} similar challenges and has [[made minerals
diplomacy central to its foreign policy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Despite
accounting for only 1 percent to 10 percent of global lithium, cobalt,
nickel and copper production, China imports enough to process more than
65 percent of some of these metals and 90 percent of rare earths. This
level of control is the outcome of years of strategic industrial
planning and foreign policy efforts by Beijing.

Mr. Trump appears to be taking a page from China's playbook of active
minerals diplomacy. The draft agreement with Ukraine would reportedly
create a fund controlled by the United States and Ukraine to receive
future revenue from Ukraine's natural resources. But if it is signed, it
is not clear whether such an agreement will actually enhance U.S.
mineral security. In fact, it will be decades before we see the impact
of this agreement, if at all.

The United States has seemingly minimal knowledge of Ukraine's
underground resources. There is no modern mapping of the country's rare
earth deposits; the most recent surveys are believed to have been
conducted 30 to 60 years ago by what was then the Soviet Union. Without
up-to-date geological data, it is impossible to determine whether these
resources are economically viable for extraction. If the ore grade is
too low, the deposits are too small or the byproducts aren't valuable
enough, private companies are unlikely to invest the \$500 million to
\$1 billion needed to develop a mine and separation plant.

Moreover, under the draft agreement, Ukraine would be required to pay a
percentage of proceeds from newly developed mineral assets into a
reconstruction investment fund with joint U.S. and Ukraine ownership;
existing mineral, oil and gas operations are to remain exempt. Given
that the average time to develop a mine from resource discovery to
production is approximately 18 years, it will take at least that long
--- four more U.S. presidential election cycles --- before the United
States can begin sourcing minerals from Ukraine.

[There are ways to make [minerals diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[effective]{.underline}, [but it [will require]{.mark}]{.underline} a
willingness by [[the U.S.]{.mark} [government]{.mark}]{.underline} not
just [[to]{.mark} strike deals]{.underline} but [also to [**spend and
invest**, over a long period]{.mark},]{.underline} in countries that
have the mineral resources we need. That may be a tough sell at a time
of fiscal austerity and budget cuts to the federal government. But China
did not build the significant competitive advantage it holds in electric
vehicle manufacturing by reducing spending. One analysis found that
between 2009 and 2023, the Chinese government allocated at least \$230.9
billion in subsidies to help develop the nascent industry. The fruits of
that effort are apparent in the domination of BYD's electric vehicles
worldwide.

So how should the American government spend the resources needed to
build a competitive minerals diplomacy strategy? First, the United
States should increase the capacity of the U.S. Geological Survey to
conduct geological mapping and reduce exploration risks in key regions.
Many resource-rich countries remain unmapped or reliant on outdated
surveys. The U.S. Geological Survey could also place their attachés in
embassies, to work alongside geological surveys and mining ministries in
host countries, promoting resource development strategies that are
favorable to Western investors.

Second, the United States needs to help build roads, bridges and other
infrastructure in mineral-rich places. Mining is one of the most
energy-intensive sectors in the world. Globally, it accounts for 38
percent of industrial energy use. One of the challenges with mining in
Ukraine, for example, is the fact that missile and drone strikes have
damaged about half of that country's power substations. To ease the way
for Western mining companies in Ukraine, the United States should
increase funding to institutions like the U.S. International Development
Finance Corporation, which can help rebuild some of those assets.

Any government-to-government cooperation agreement is useful only if it
stimulates investment by private mining companies, which develop those
minerals into a form that companies like Apple and Tesla can use. But
the world's most resource-rich nations, such as the Democratic Republic
of Congo, are not easy places for businesses to operate. The U.S.
government can help mitigate those risks by supporting mining project
negotiations and dispute resolution, and providing financing at
below-market rates and political risk insurance.

China has long aligned its infrastructure investments to mineral
investments. The 2007 Sino-Congolais des Mines agreement is a key
example of a resource-for-infrastructure deal. Under this arrangement,
Chinese companies gained access to cobalt, copper and other minerals in
exchange for the development of infrastructure, such as roads and
hospitals. The Chinese consortium pledged more than \$6.5 billion for
infrastructure projects, securing mining rights to deposits near Kolwezi
in the southeastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which
were estimated to be worth \$93 billion. As a result, China now owns or
has stakes in 15 of Congo's biggest copper and cobalt mines.

The United States needs to come up with a blueprint for how minerals
diplomacy can play out in other parts of the world, not just Ukraine.
The Democratic Republic of Congo recently proposed that it could offer
the United States and Europe access to its mineral reserves in return
for military assistance, amid its ongoing conflict with neighboring
Rwanda. Such an agreement is well worth considering and, if it is
pursued, should be backed up with real investment.

Mining is a long and costly process. If [[America]{.mark}]{.underline}
is to be a global leader in the minerals it needs for national, economic
and energy security, it [[will have]{.mark} [to go beyond signing
agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Ukraine and elsewhere, [[strategic
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} and substantive investment [[will]{.mark}
[determine whether]{.mark}]{.underline} such
[[deals]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[deliver]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[mineral security]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States is looking
for.

Moreover, [Beijing has pursued]{.underline} economic
[investment]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the critical infrastructure
and extractive industries across [the transatlantic Arctic]{.underline};
often employing aggressive tactics including predatory lending and
sovereign loan guarantee structures long common in China's engagement
with African and South American nations and, more recently, along NATO's
Eastern Flank. The [[Chinese]{.mark} [government]{.mark} [has expended
**significant diplomatic capital** to]{.mark} develop strategic
[investments in Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[engaging with]{.mark}
the [Greenlandic government]{.mark}]{.underline} [and local
communities]{.underline}, in part [[to **solidify**
its]{.underline}]{.mark} strong [position in the]{.underline} rare-earth
and critical [[mineral extractives industry]{.underline}]{.mark}
worldwide. These investment attempts are screened by Danish officials
involved in Greenland's foreign policy and national security process,
who together have recognized that significant involvement of Chinese
state-owned enterprises in the Greenlandic economy would enable Beijing
to wield influence over Greenland's affairs and have de facto influence
on Arctic Council governance decisions. All while Chinese firm
investments totaled nearly 12 percent of the Greenlandic gross domestic
product between 2012-2017.

Like its existing and planned economic investments in Arctic critical
infrastructure developed through the "Polar Silk Road," [Beijing has led
the development]{.underline} and deployment [of]{.underline}
significant, permanent scientific research stations and [infrastructure
across the northern Atlantic]{.underline}, [thereby increasing its
physical presence across the region]{.underline}---including on the
territory of NATO Allies Norway and Iceland. In 2003, the Chinese
government opened the Arctic Yellow River Station on the Norwegian
island of Svalbard and has built on this presence recently with the
October 2018 opening of the China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory
(CIAO)---a permanent scientific installation dedicated to a wide
spectrum of research objectives, including geomagnetic field
measurements, aurora observations, climatology, glaciology,
oceanography, and biology.

The [Kvanefjeld project in southern Greenland]{.underline} is [known for
its large rare-earth and uranium deposits]{.underline}. [These
[resources offer]{.mark} great [econ]{.mark}omic [potential, but
environmental **issues**]{.mark} have been [front and
center]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those [[fears of toxic waste
**contaminating** drinking water]{.mark} and **[harming]{.mark}** the
area's [ag]{.mark}riculture, especially sheep farming]{.underline},
underpin opposition to the mining activity.

[[Greenland has]{.underline}]{.mark} a [long and [**troubled** history
with mining pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with [remnants of lead and
zinc mines from the]{.mark} 19[70s **still** contaminating the]{.mark}
[environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[local ecosystem]{.mark}, vital
for Inuit hunter-gatherers who rely on seals, whales, and other marine
life, [remains at **risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recognizing these
concerns, Greenland's 2021 elections became widely known as the "mining
election," where the Inuit Ataqatigiit party campaigned against uranium
mining. Upon taking power, the government fulfilled its promise by
passing legislation banning uranium extraction, effectively halting the
Kvanefjeld project. While celebrated as a victory for environmental and
public health, this decision led to a legal dispute with Energy
Transition Minerals (ETM), which argues that the mining ban constitutes
expropriation and is demanding compensation of up to \$11.5 billion.
This case exemplifies the [growing tensions between sovereign
environmental regulations and corporate economic interests]{.underline},
a conflict frequently adjudicated in international arbitration
tribunals, where damages for similar disputes have reached staggering
amounts.

#### Increased mining would devastate Greenland's land\-\-- Climate Change is at a tipping point.

[[Greenland]{.mark} is [warming]{.mark} [**twice** as fast]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} the [rest of]{.mark} the [planet]{.mark} and now the outside
world and its business elites have come to claim a piece of the immense
frozen pie]{.underline}. Even more rarefied than nickel and platinum are
elements like neodymium, dysprosium, scandium, yttrium and others. China
has a near stranglehold on the supply of these elements and Greenland
offers a way out of the monopoly. [Kvanefjeld in the very southern tip
of Greenland could be a supplier of rare earth oxides, uranium and other
elements for decades.]{.underline} It is the second largest mine of its
kind on Earth[. Near Kvanefjed is the community of Narsaq home to farmer
Naasu Lund who feels that a [proposed uranium mine would **spoil** the
incredible land]{.mark} that she was born to.]{.underline} The [240
million dollars that would go to Greenland is not enough for many of the
locals who bemoan the [potential for]{.mark} the [very real
**desecration** of an **entire** region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Greenland
Minerals Limited from Australia have a shareholder, Shenghe Resources
Holding from China, a rare earth processing company. [Many are skeptical
of the benefits, because most of the jobs will go to the specialized
workers involved in the mines. [All that will be **left** is
contamination.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Mariane Paviasen, from Narsaq, elected to Greenland's Parliament, whose
main industry is fishing is worried about the [radioactive
byproducts]{.mark} that [will **leach** into the soil and
ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [open mine pit would have wreaked havoc
on her village of 1,700 on the southwest coast.]{.underline} She managed
to convince the local population to oppose the mine. "I was aware that
this thing would affect us. So I had to do something," she said. As
locals began to understand about the tailings and the pollution public
opinion began to shift. She managed to convince the locals to oppose
Greenland Minerals. "The mining companies know what we have in Narsaq.
We are not safe in the future," she said. [Greenland Minerals insists
that the radioactive waste would be minimal. Minimal on what is one of
the most isolated and pristine environments on Earth.]{.underline}

Most Inuit are against uranium mining but some support zinc and gold
extraction. While the balance between economics and the environment has
yet to be struck, other mining operations are scouring the bottom of the
sea for equally promising rare earth finds. What will happen to the
shrimp, salmon and halibut the local fishermen depend on? What will
happen to the water?

Between Greenland and the bottom of the sea, capitalism is looking for
resources to fuel a civilization that is ironically on its last legs.
[[Weather]{.mark} [events that were not supposed to happen until the
2060's and 2070's are happening **now**]{.mark}. [Sections of]{.mark}
the [Arctic]{.mark} [will become rain **dominated**]{.mark} in the not
too distant future]{.underline}. [2012, when we first went to western
Greenland, was the year of the great melt when scientists were walking
on slush everywhere they went.]{.underline} Some scientists like Marc
Tedesco, a research professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory,
called his camp "Little Venice." [Some models indicated increased snow
over the next two decades or more but then the rain would come. Now the
rain has come. The melting glaciers would have humbled even the most
diehard skeptics]{.underline}. Glaciologist Konrad Steffen had foreseen
what would happen to Greenland. It was thought [in the 1990's that major
changes to the ice sheet would only happen on a centennial or millennial
time scale. Now [changes are happening within a few years,
**astounding** the scientific community]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
But Steffen, who was director of the Swiss Federal institute for
Forests, Snow and Landscapes and who spent some of his best earthly
moments traversing ice fields and sleeping on glaciers could not foresee
the day he would die falling in a Greenland crevasse last summer at the
age of 68. If leaders at the cop26 could have peered into the depths of
the crevasse that took Steffen's life, perhaps they would have acted
with a little more urgency. They would have seen a crevasse as a
metaphor for the hole that could easily swallow our entire civilization.

The [most [**pressing** concern]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[[is]{.mark} the [environmental **impact** of resource extraction in one
of the world's **most** **fragile** ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[**Greenland** is home to pristine wilderness, diverse wildlife,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[ecosystems]{.mark} that have remained largely
undisturbed for millennia. [Extracting resources]{.mark}]{.underline}
from such an environment [[comes with **significant**
risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Mining]{.mark} activities]{.underline} can [[**lead** to habitat
**destruction**, soil erosion, and water **pollution**]{.mark},
threatening the unique flora and fauna that call Greenland
home]{.underline}. For instance, the [[**toxic** byproducts of
mining]{.mark} rare earth elements, including radioactive waste, [can
**contaminate** water supplies]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[**[harm]{.mark}** marine and terrestrial
[ecosystems.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Oil and gas exploration pose even greater dangers]{.underline}. The
[risk of oil spills in Arctic waters is]{.underline} particularly
[concerning, as]{.underline} the [region's cold temperatures and limited
infrastructure make cleanup efforts extremely difficult]{.underline}. A
[single spill]{.underline} could [have devastating and long-lasting
consequences for local ecosystems, fisheries, and
communities.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the [[**emissions** generated by resource
extraction]{.mark} and transport [would contribute to global greenhouse
gas levels]{.mark}]{.underline}, [exacerbating the very climate change
that is making Greenland's resources accessible]{.underline} in the
first place. This creates a tragic irony: [[as melting ice **opens
up**]{.mark} opportunities for [exploitation,]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[activities]{.mark} required [to seize those opportunities
**accelerate**]{.mark} the [warming]{.mark}]{.underline} of the planet.

Except **[open-pit mining of Greenland's rare earth metals will have a
far greater impact environmental impact than portrayed by the
media]{.underline}**, the United States Government, and mining
companies.

I was one of two onsite geologists who aided in the expansion of Idaho's
huge open-pit Maybe Canyon Phosphate Mine. This experience taught me
that it is difficult to appreciate the size and complex operations of a
giant open-pit mine unless you have worked in one.

I am certain the public does not have any idea of the processes involved
in open-pit mining. Like most products, the public thinks that rare
earth metals magically appear.

They Don't.

The photo below is Utah's Kennicott open-pit copper mine, which is 2.5
miles wide, 0.75 miles deep, and has removed six billion tons of rock
rich in copper.

Copper is a rare earth metal so this mine is an excellent example of
what an open-pit mine in Greenland would look like.

[Operations]{.underline} of an open-pit mine

[Use **chemicals**]{.underline} that were taken from another mined area
to explode solid rock areas of the mine.

Use [**diesel**-powered machines]{.underline} to reduce the size of
large boulders created by the explosions.

Utilize **[multiple monster diesel-fueled trucks]{.underline}** to haul
off the crushed rock. Trucks that are built with iron extracted from
another mine and rubber tires that are [generated by **processing
oil**]{.underline}. You need to drill wells, some in ocean areas, to
produce oil.

[Build a **diesel**]{.underline}- [or **natural gas**-fueled **refinery
plant**]{.underline}. It is important to note that natural gas is
composed of 90% methane. So, the [refineries]{.underline} will [**emit
huge** amounts of **methane** into the atmosphere]{.underline}. Also, [a
rare earth metal plant needs **20 tons of water**]{.underline} (150
trillion gallons of water) [to make **one ton** of rare earth
metals]{.underline}.

Build a large reservoir capable of retaining vast amounts of mined waste
rock.

[Construct a network of **huge pipelines** to transport **mined waste
rock** to the]{.underline} mined waste-rock retaining
[reservoir]{.underline}.

[Ship the]{.underline} now [**concentrated metals** to another
processing plant]{.underline} that prepares the metals, which are placed
in a renewable-energy device.

[Restore the mined area to its **original** state]{.underline}. [This
process uses **monster trucks**]{.underline}, graders, etc. So, the
**[restoration]{.underline}** process [also has a **large carbon
footprint**]{.underline}.

The [**process** of]{.underline} open-pit [mining Greenland's rare earth
metals will cause **significant**]{.underline},
**[unintended]{.underline}**, [and **irreversible** damage to
Greenland's **physical** and **biological environments**]{.underline}.
Here are a few examples.

1\. [**Scares** on]{.underline} Pristine [Coastlines]{.underline}.

2\. [**Failure** of Mine]{.underline} Waste Rock [Retaining
Lakes]{.underline}

Pictured above is the failure of Imperial Metals Mount Polley gold and
copper mine waste-rock retaining-reservoir failure. This occurred in
British Columbia, Canada, and it [dumped **24 million cubic
meters**]{.underline} (more than 31 million cubic yards) [of mine
**waste** and **sludge** into]{.underline} neighboring
[Lake]{.underline} Polley [and **polluted** the]{.underline} Hazeltine
**[Creek]{.underline}** watershed (above figure and here).

Through the years, [**thousands** of **waste-rock** retaining
reservoirs]{.underline} and lakes [have **failed**]{.underline}. Mostly
because when the mines are abandoned, they aren't maintained. [Failure
of Greenland's]{.underline} rare earth [metal mines would **empty** into
**surrounding** ocean areas and **bays**]{.underline}. Not good.

3\. [Radioactive Pollution]{.underline}

[Greenland's rare earth metal **accumulations**]{.underline} are [**very
rich** in **radioactive** uranium]{.underline}. In the not-so-distant
past, Greenland was on the verge of opening a monster open-pit mine that
contained significant amounts of uranium.

"Greenland may soon start building the world's fifth-largest uranium
mine and second-biggest rare earth operation, which could fuel
independence dreams in the island, an "autonomous administrative
division" within Denmark since 2009" ( see here ).

However, native Greenlanders strongly objected to the [**mining** of
**radioactive-rich** rocks]{.underline} near their hunting grounds and
villages. The proposed mines are known to have high levels of
radioactive rocks.

The quote below details the presence of radioactive rocks in the
open-mining areas within Greenland.

"NOAH and Renewable Energy, another Danish NGO, list many serious
environmental costs if the Kvanefjeld mine is allowed to proceed. There
are huge [risks]{.underline} from [air pollution]{.underline} during
open-cut mining [and **even greater risks** associated with **dumping**
radioactive waste]{.underline} in Lake Tareq. In addition to uranium,
the radioactive [waste would include **thorium**]{.underline}. Thorium
tailings are 3‒[**10 times more radioactive** than uranium]{.underline},
the two NGOs pointed out in their September 12 submission, responding to
the mine's latest Environmental Impact Statement. The tailings will
[cause health problems]{.underline}, **[even if]{.underline}** the
built-in [dams behave as planned]{.underline}. The [risk **increases**
over **time**]{.underline}, primarily after the mine has been shut down
and when monitoring and maintenance have been completed. In addition to
the planned discharges, [there will be **unintentional spills** via
leaks and accidents]{.underline}. In the long run, [**large** areas
around the mine will be **contaminated**]{.underline} with radioactive
elements and non-radioactive substances, many of [which are **highly
toxic**]{.underline}. The [people living in the **polluted** areas will
be **permanently exposed** to radioactive]{.underline} and other toxic
[substances via drinking **water**]{.underline}, **[food]{.underline}**,
[and **air**]{.underline}. **[Seafood]{.underline}** is also [becoming
**polluted** due to the **massive** **discharges** of
waste]{.underline}, including wastewater, along the coast.
[**Bioaccumulation** of **radionuclides**]{.underline} and
non-radioactive chemicals can [become a **serious**
problem]{.underline}. All this means that uranium mining in Kuannersuit
[in addition to **significant** chemical pollution]{.underline} will
[leave millions of **tons of tailings** containing]{.underline} some of
[the **most toxic** known radioactive substances]{.underline}, [such as
**radium**]{.underline}, **[thorium]{.underline}**,
**[radon]{.underline}**, [and **polonium**]{.underline}, and this waste
[remains **radioactive**]{.underline} at a dangerous level [for
**hundreds of thousands of years**]{.underline}. In addition, the Arctic
environment is particularly vulnerable to pollution because it is
rebuilding very slowly, and the long-term consequences of uranium mining
could be extensive radioactive pollution, which, due to the health
hazard, may make it necessary to ban agriculture, fishing, trapping, and
livestock farming." (see here).

#### Uranium and thorium-rich deposits poison air, land, and seafood\-\--Mining would expose Arctic populations to lethal radiation and wipe out traditional livelihoods.

4\. [Mercury Pollution]{.underline}

Research studies have proven that the rivers, ocean bays, and open ocean
waters [in the **proposed** Greenland mining areas have **extremely high
concentrations** of natural mercury]{.underline}.

Mercury comes from bedrock layers that are mercury rich. Mercury is a
rare earth mineral. [If anything goes **awry** with the **mining**

natural [mercury will get **dumped** into Greenland's **seawater** and

industrial activity, the researchers believe the Greenland mercury is
coming from natural sources. If it were coming from human pollution,
then the snow on top of the ice sheet should also be full of
mercury---yet previous studies have shown it's comparatively clean.
Instead, the [scientists believe]{.underline} the **[meltwater
mercury]{.underline}** is probably leaching out of the bedrock beneath
the ice. Mercury concentration in the meltwater rivers was at least [an
**order of magnitude higher** than the concentrations found in
**ordinary** rivers across the Arctic]{.underline}. These concentrations
became slightly diluted by the time they flowed out into the
fjords---but were still higher than expected, the researchers say. [Even
after **mingling** with the **salty water**]{.underline}, [the
**levels**]{.underline} in the fjords **[remained]{.underline}** about
[an **order of magnitude higher** than]{.underline} the mercury levels
[found in **most** open ocean **waters**]{.underline}" (see here).

#### Toxic leaching, groundwater contamination, and sterile soil from decades of mining show that "clean extraction" is a myth\-\--Greenland would inherit the same poisoned legacy.

[It's **challenging** to mine]{.underline} and process [rare earths
**without** harming the environment]{.underline}. The problems are
related to the two primary extraction methods.

The first involves [**removing** the topsoil]{.underline},
[**transporting** it to a **leaching** pond]{.underline}, [and adding
**chemicals**]{.underline} (such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium
chloride) to separate out the metals. The chemicals used in this
separation process can [create **air pollution**]{.underline}, [cause
**erosion**]{.underline}, [and **leach** into groundwater]{.underline}.

The second processing method [involves **drilling** holes into the
ground]{.underline}, inserting [**PVC** pipes and **rubber** hoses and
**pumping** chemicals]{.underline} to flush out earth. The resulting
[**slurry** is]{.underline} then [pumped into **leaching**
ponds]{.underline} to separate out the rare-earth metal.

This method creates the same problems as with topsoil removal with the
addition of the PVC pipes, rubber hoses and other sundry used by mining
crews remaining littered in the mines.

[Abandoned mines pose **ongoing** environmental
**hazards**]{.underline}. [Remaining chemicals]{.underline} can continue
to [**leach** into]{.underline} groundwater.

Mines may also contain pools of wastewater that can potentially [pour
into **local waterways**]{.underline}. For example, in its 2016 report,
China Water Risk highlighted an abandoned mine in Ganzhou where
untreated chemicals flow from leaching ponds when it rains.

Problems in China

[The **pollution** resulting]{.underline} from rare-earth mining has
[created soil **incapable** of supporting **crops** and water supplies
have been **contaminated**]{.underline}.

Chinese officials have attempted to counteract these threats by shutting
down a large number of mines, especially the smaller and the illegal
ones, but there are still severe, large-scale threats that remain
unresolved.

Clean-Up Efforts

From north near the Mongolian border to south in Guangdong, China is
[**struggling** to **clean-up** the environment polluted by
**mining**]{.underline} and some claim they are [making things
**worse**]{.underline}. [The clean-up process is
**expensive**]{.underline} and time-consuming, and some say [it could be
**50-100 years** for the environment to recover]{.underline}.

#### Greenland mining is toxic\-\--Radioactive tailings contaminate ecosystems and livelihoods.

**Greenfield '25** \[Patrick and Phoebe Weston; March 5; Biodiversity
and environment reporter for the Guardian and the Observer; The
Guardian, "Fearing toxic waste, Greenland ended uranium mining. Now,
they could be forced to restart - or pay \$11bn,"

//jwh

[A]{.underline} proposed open-pit [**mine** would be worth about
\$7.5bn]{.underline} (£6bn) if it went ahead, according to the site
operator, generating income for the island's economy.

[But]{.underline} when the mining company acquired the site in 2007,
[the **impact** of]{.underline} potentially [**radioactive** waste
contaminating drinking **water**]{.underline} and nearby sheep farms
[alarmed]{.underline} local [people]{.underline}. They feared that the
"**[tailings]{.underline}**" -- [a **slurry** of ground-up waste from
mining]{.underline} -- [would be **laced** with **radioactive waste**
and could **contaminate** waterways]{.underline} or [**spread** as
**dust** in the air]{.underline}.

[Greenland has a **troubled** history with **mining
pollution**]{.underline}: the [sites of **lead** and
**zinc**]{.underline} mines developed in the 1970s [**remain** polluted
more than **50 years** later]{.underline}, [with **fish**]{.underline},
**[mussels]{.underline}** [and **seaweed** still testing positive for
**toxins**]{.underline}. The ecosystem surrounding Narsaq is rich with
seals, whales and other marine life, which Inuit hunter-gatherers rely
on for their livelihoods.

#### Greenland ore grades are too low\-\--Mining would require massive pits and unsustainable energy use.

Nor do Greenland's deposits fare well in comparison with other mines or
deposits. [**Typical** ore **grades** at successful mines]{.underline}
or attractive deposits [are between **4** and **8** percent]{.underline}
rare earths. [The **ore** at the mines at]{.underline} Mount Weld in
[**Australia** and]{.underline} Mountain Pass in
**[California]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the deposits at
**[Nolans Bore]{.underline}** in Australia [and **Bear
Lodge**]{.underline} in Wyoming, [all fall **within** that
range]{.underline}. [In **Kvanefjeld** the number is **1.4
percent**]{.underline}, and [in **Kringlerne**]{.underline}, it [dips as
**low** as **0.38 percent**]{.underline}. [The Greenlandic mines would
consequently require **larger** open **pits** and **much more energy**
for **crushing**]{.underline}, **[separation]{.underline}**, [and
**refining**]{.underline}, [which would **inevitably** **drive up
costs** for **establishing**]{.underline} mines [and]{.underline} for
actually [operating them]{.underline}.

#### Harsh Arctic terrain dooms mining\-\--Greenland's conditions repel investment and scale.

//jwh

[Mining]{.underline} companies [in Greenland]{.underline} operate in one
of [the **most challenging** environments in the **world** because of
the]{.underline} Danish territory's [**sparse**
infrastructure]{.underline}, [**hostile** weather and a **tricky**
political **climate**]{.underline}. [Mining]{.underline} here [is
**expensive**]{.underline}, [and **few** investors are **willing** to
pay for it]{.underline} given the uncertainties.

Despite its extraordinary mineral wealth, [Greenland has **only two**
active mines]{.underline}: a gold mine in commissioning phase and a mine
producing anorthosite, used in fiberglass, paints and other construction
materials. [A ruby mine **closed** last year owing to
**bankruptcy**]{.underline}. Greenland has extended around 100 mining
licenses, mostly for exploration.

"[Investing in Greenland is **not for the faint of
heart**]{.underline}," said Brian Hanrahan, chief executive officer of
Lumina Sustainable Materials, which operates the anorthosite mine on the
west coast of Greenland. "[The local logistics are **incredibly
complex**]{.underline}."

Building a mine here [involves **high** startup **costs**]{.underline},
[and has to be done from **scratch** in **rugged terrain**]{.underline}.
Greenland is nearly one-fourth the size of the U.S., and about [**80%**
of it is covered by ice]{.underline}, [with **deep fjords** and **ice**
sheets up to a **mile thick**]{.underline}. [There are **no roads**
between **settlements**]{.underline}, [and **shipping** is
**treacherous** because of **floating ice** off the coast]{.underline}.

[Bureaucracy is a **hindrance**]{.underline}, too. The [process of
**granting licenses** to **foreign** companies to mine is **lengthy**
and **cumbersome**]{.underline}. While applying for licenses, companies
need to keep employees on payroll with benefits. With a population of
57,000, Greenland's labor market is tight.

#### REE mining unleashes toxic and radioactive pollution\-\--Greenland lacks safeguards.

[**Rare** earth elements]{.underline} are not rare exactly. Rather, they
[exist in **small quantities** in the natural world]{.underline}, so
it's hard to find concentrations worth mining. [When you do find usable
deposits]{.underline}, in minerals such as bastnaesite and monazite,
[these minerals require **heavy processing** to get **usable**
REEs]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, in the human world, they can be found everywhere. The glassy
black display of every smartphone likely contains praseodymium and
dysprosium. The magnets tucked in the microphone and speaker contain
praseodymium and neodymium. The magnets in the motors of electric cars
have praseodymium, neodymium, and dysprosium. So do the magnets in wind
turbines. These three elements are all classified as rare earth
elements, and all of them are key to the transition away from fossil
fuels.

[Every step]{.underline}, [from **extraction** to
**processing**]{.underline}, [poses **threats** to the]{.underline}
surrounding [environment]{.underline} in the absence of tight,
rigorously enforced environmental regulations. Balaram Vysetti, chief
scientist at the National Geophysical Research Institute in Hyderabad,
India, said in an email that the "**[cutting]{.underline}**,
**[drilling]{.underline}**, **[blasting]{.underline}**,
**[transportation]{.underline}**, **[stockpiling]{.underline}**, [and
**processing**]{.underline}" of REEs can [release **dust** containing
REEs and]{.underline} other [**toxic metals** into the air]{.underline},
[impacting **human** and **ecosystem** health]{.underline}. If the
deposit contains radioactive elements like **[uranium]{.underline}** or
**[thorium]{.underline}**, Vysetti said that the [**radioactivity** can
contaminate **air**]{.underline}, **[water]{.underline}**,
**[soil]{.underline}**, [and **groundwater**]{.underline}.

//jwh

[**Dramatic** change on]{.underline} and around [the
island]{.underline}, though, could [make mining for rare earths **even
more complicated**]{.underline}. While the loss of floating ice in the
waters around the island makes it easier and safer for ships to
navigate, [more **chunks** of glaciers will **drop** into the ocean as
the world warms]{.underline}, which could [become **especially
hazardous** for ships]{.underline}, à la the Titanic.

Even given the rapid loss of Greenland's 650,000-square-mile ice sheet,
though, it would take a long while to lose it all---it's 1.4 miles thick
on average. The Earth itself is also frozen in parts of the island,
known as permafrost, which will thaw in the nearer term as temperatures
rise. "[That\'s going to give you certainly **instability** in terms of
building **access** roads]{.underline} and such," said Paul Bierman, a
geologist at the University of Vermont and author of the book When the
Ice Is Gone: What a Greenland Ice Core Reveals About Earth\'s Tumultuous
History and Perilous Future. "The climate is changing, so I think [it\'s
going to be a **very dynamic** environment in which to **extract**
minerals]{.underline}."

[Mining pollution]{.underline}, too, [is a **major
concern**]{.underline}: [The **accessible** land along the island's
**ice-free** edges is]{.underline} also [where **humans**
live]{.underline}. [As **mining** equipment and **ships** burn **fossil
fuels**]{.underline}, [they produce **black carbon**]{.underline}. When
this settles on ice, [it **darkens** the surface]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} then [**absorbs** more
**sunlight**]{.underline}---think of how much hotter you get wearing a
black shirt than a white shirt on a summer day. This could [**further
accelerate** the **melting** of Greenland's **precarious** ice
sheet]{.underline}. A 2022 study also found that three legacy mines in
Greenland heavily polluted the local environment with metals, like lead
and zinc, due to the lack of environmental studies and regulation prior
to the 1970s. But it also found no significant pollution at mines
established in the last 20 years.

A more immediate problem with mining is [the]{.underline} potentially
[**toxic dust** generated by so much **machinery**]{.underline}, said
Niels Henrik Hooge, a campaigner at NOAH, the Danish chapter of the
environmental organization Friends of the Earth. "That\'s [a
**concern**]{.underline}, [because all the **mining projects** are
located in areas where **people** live]{.underline}, or potentially
could live," Hooge said. "Everything is a bit different in the Arctic,
because **[the environment does not recover very quickly when
polluted]{.underline}**."

[[In a massive blow to]{.underline}]{.mark} US [President]{.underline}
Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [[allowed a Danish-French consortium]{.underline} [to
mine]{.underline}]{.mark} a rock which is key to the production of
aluminum. On Wednesday, Greenland granted a 30-year mining license to a
Danish-French mining consortium seeking to extract a moon-like rock that
may serve as a climate-friendly alternative in aluminum production.

Donald Trump continues to insist that the US could "get" Greenland,
which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, despite Copenhagen saying
that's impossible. Vice President [[JD Vance]{.underline}]{.mark}
visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the US military base
there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip,
Vance scolded Denmark but [[acknowledged that
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} would control its own sovereignty ---
while still suggesting that it [[may want to make a deal with the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}. But Trump\'s talks of annexing Greenland is
still in talking stage.

Here are ten points about the Greenland-Europe minerals deal:

\-[Greenland]{.underline} has [granted a Danish-French consortium the
right to exploit a]{.underline} type of [rock]{.underline} essential for
aluminum production, but used in various industries, including the glass
fiber industry. -[The permit was]{.underline} issued to Greenland
Anorthosite Mining (GAM) for the extraction of anorthosite---an
important mineral---[following earlier interest from]{.underline} U.S.
[President]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline} in purchasing the
autonomous island, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

-Jesper Willaing Zeuthen, associate professor at Aalborg University, in
Denmark, told Newsweek Trump\'s interest in Greenland\'s resources is
likely to be more in securing long-term investment objects which is
difficult under current Greenlandic legislation.

-Greenland Anorthosite Mining (GAM) has received approval to mine
anorthosite---a white rock primarily made up of aluminum, micro silica,
and calcium. The company intends to export the crushed material from
western Greenland for use in the fiberglass manufacturing industry.

-In announcing the 30-year permit, Greenland\'s Mineral Resources
Minister Naaja Nathanielsen said the goal was to scale the project to
become a climate-friendly alternative to bauxite in producing aluminum
for aircraft, vehicles and defense.

-Although [business delegates from the US visited the island this year,
the rhetoric]{.mark} of the Trump administration [has]{.mark} [not
resulted in]{.mark} formal [dialogue]{.mark} or direct investments.
[Collaboration with the EU and Denmark is proceeding more

[[Greenland has given permission to a Canadian mining company]{.mark}
[to explore for molybdenum]{.mark}]{.underline}, a metal critical to the
production of steel, amid growing demand from the defence industry.

The [Arctic]{.underline} island and its [mineral]{.underline}
riche[s]{.underline} [have]{.underline} this year [become hot
geopolitical topics after]{.underline} Donald [Trump's]{.underline}
persistent requests to take over the territory, which is part of the
Kingdom of Denmark. At the same time, [[the
E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion [[has
identified]{.mark} [Greenland as a strategic area of
interest]{.mark}]{.underline} as the continent tries to become less
dependent on the import of raw materials.

[[Greenland Resources Inc]{.mark}.,]{.underline} which is [[based in
Toronto]{.underline}, [got a 30-year exploitation
permit]{.underline}]{.mark} for molybdenum and magnesium at the
Malmbjerg project in east Greenland, according to a statement late
Thursday. The company can apply to extend the licence period to up to 50
years.

[The miner said]{.underline} [Malmbjerg has]{.underline} the potential
to supply all the [EU's demand for]{.underline} molybdenum for defence
purposes for [decades]{.underline} to come, even as military budgets
expand. The Canadian company has signed offtake deals with European
steelmakers. Primary molybdenum is currently only produced in China,
which has 87 per cent of the market, and the United States, which has
the remaining 13 per cent, the company said.

"The progress we are experiencing in the mineral resources sector is
good news for all of us," Naaja H. Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister in
charge of business and minerals, said in the statement. "The mineral
resources projects contribute to the Greenland government's goal of a
self-sustaining economy and local communities are served through job
creation."

Last week, [another Canadian miner raised funds to help expand
production]{.underline} at Greenland's main gold deposit, Nalunaq. In

# Greenland Secession DA

### 1NC

#### Support for independence is [growing]{.underline}, but economic concerns [deter]{.underline} full autonomy now. Western mining in the region [guarantees secession]{.underline}.

https://menas.co.uk/blog/greenlands-opportunity-to-capitalise-on-growing-international-interest

A Path to Independence?

It is no secret that [[many]{.mark} in Greenland [**support**
independence]{.mark}]{.underline}. A 2025 poll revealed that
[approximately 84% of its population **wants it** [but only **45%** do
if it does **not negatively impact**]{.mark} their [standard of
living]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a 2024 survey, [[Greenlanders
identified]{.mark} 'higher [living costs']{.mark}]{.underline} and the
'economic situation' [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[most pressing
challenges]{.mark} facing]{.underline} their [society]{.underline}.
Given these concerns, the potential [[**economic risks** associated with
independence have led to **caution**]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
standard of living could be jeopardised.

[[Greenland is]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [financially [dependent
on]{.mark}]{.underline} an annual block grant from
**[[Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}** which accounts for more than half of
its parliamentary budget. The [economic situation has been]{.underline}
the [[primary factor inhibiting]{.underline}]{.mark} the indigenous
[[independence]{.mark} movement]{.underline}. The increasing **[[Western
interest]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Greenland
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[provide]{.mark} it with
a]{.underline} viable **[[path to independence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Although some locals are understandably cautious about foreign
interests, there is significant support for more cooperation [with the
**US**]{.underline}, Canada, Denmark and the EU.

[Greenland's 'open for business' approach]{.underline} with the West
[could provide mutually beneficial outcomes]{.underline}, and
particularly through the promotion of its mining and energy
opportunities. [[An increase in]{.underline}]{.mark} cooperation and
[[**investment** could drive]{.underline}]{.mark} the [sufficient
economic [**development** and stability needed to support]{.mark}
Greenlandic [society, making independence a **clear option**]{.mark}
while limiting risks that would sacrifice]{.underline} the [Greenlandic
standard of living]{.underline}.

The March 2025 Election

Greenland's 11 March election is arguably its most important and will
garner unprecedented international attention. The key election issues
include:

Independence -- most Greenlandic political parties support independence
but their views differ on the best strategy and timeline;

Partnership with foreign countries -- Greenland's choice of who to
cooperate with, and to what extent, differ amongst the parties;

Resource Governance -- varying opinions on the management of resource
wealth and particularly balancing the mining permitting policies with
environmental concerns. The current ban on uranium mining ban is a key
example of these differences.

A January 2025 poll showed a lead of approximately 9% for in incumbent
Inuit Ataqatigiit party. However, with the Siumut party's promise of a
post-election independence referendum, and the Naleraq party's growing
popularity, it is difficult to accurately predict the results. The
election results are expected in the early on 12 March and could shape
Greenland's geopolitical and economic future.

Greenland's growing international relevance presents both opportunities
and challenges as it navigates its future. While the prospect of a US
purchase remains unrealistic, the increasing Western engagement ---
particularly in mining, energy and security --- offers potential
economic benefits that could support Greenland's independence goals.
Today's election will be a pivotal moment, determining the island's
approach to foreign partnerships and its path toward greater
self-sufficiency.

UPDATE: 12 March [[2025 election]{.underline}]{.mark} results

[Although]{.underline} the [polls predicted]{.underline} that [the
incumbent party would retain power]{.underline}, the [opposition
performed]{.underline} unexpectedly [**well**. The Demokraatit party
secured a surprise victory]{.underline} by winning the largest share of
votes for the first time in its history. Since the 2021 election it
gained over 20% and its seat count jumped from three to ten in the
31-seat parliament. Another opposition party, Naleraq, also performed
strongly and came second. [This [result is
**unprecedented**]{.mark}]{.underline}, because either the Inuit
Ataqatigiit or Siumut have won every election since 1991. [The
[Greenlandic people **clearly wanted a change**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
government and direction.

[Although all four parties **support** independence, they differ in
their approach. Demokraatit favours a gradual path to
independence]{.underline}, with an in initial focus on building a strong
economic and social foundation first. [Both opposition parties support
increasing]{.underline} economic [cooperation with Western allies, which
should assist Greenland in achieving]{.underline} its long-term
[self-sufficiency]{.underline} goals. The [[**coming days** will be
notable for Greenland's]{.underline}]{.mark} future **[[independence
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** because Demokraatit will now decide
whether to form a coalition government and, if so, with which party.

#### Independence upsets u[parity]{.underline} in the Arctic, prompting nuclear war.

John **Ash 22**, Associate at the Scott Polar Research
Institute, University of Cambridge, 2022, "An Arctic Promised Land:
Greenlandic Independence and Security," Policy Studies Yearbook, Vol.
12, Issue 1, pp. 167-213, https://doi.org/10.18278/psy.12.1.7

This article is concerned with military security in the Arctic region
and the policy options surrounding it. The knowledge gap it addresses is
in two parts: first, how Greenland as a nascent Arctic state could
properly discharge the responsibility of defending itself and its
population. Second, the [prospective [effects of **Greenlandic
independence** on]{.mark} Arctic **[geopolitical
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is not directed at any specific
stakeholder group and has no comment to make regarding the moral rights
to self-determination of a population---indigenous or otherwise---that
identifies itself as a distinct community. Nor does it address any
aspect of perceived or actual historical wrongdoing by any state party.
Inevitably defense issues, and how they are to be addressed, will form a
part of the governmental considerations of any new nation state,
including the likely response by other nations.

Despite the formal cessation of the Cold War, the [balance of
geopolitical forces that exercise sovereignty over]{.underline} the
[Arctic remains **extant**]{.underline}.1 In effect, the Arctic is a
mediterranean ocean across which Russia confronts four NATO nations. Due
to its geographical location, Greenland forms a key element in that
balance---a wedge in one of the power blocs---which makes it an
excellent case, pertinent to Policy Studies Yearbook readers, for
studying the intersection of several recent and current policy issues
well beyond defense and security concerns. Climate change has brought
the prospect of [[increased availability of]{.mark} Arctic natural
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, and with it, concerns that these [might
[provide focal points for **conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ash 2016).
To date, these fears have proven groundless and the latest assessment by
the U.S. National Intelligence Council (U.S. NIC 2021, 8) anticipates a
regional increase in competition, largely economic in nature, with
[a]{.underline} modest [[increase]{.mark} in the [risk of
**miscalculation**]{.mark}]{.underline} by 2040. What has not abated is
the [[sensitivity in Russia concerning]{.underline}]{.mark} the [nuclear
**[second-strike capability]{.mark}** of its Northern Fleet
submarines]{.underline} based on the Kola Peninsula (Boulègue 2019,
6-8). [[In a]{.mark} future]{.underline} major armed
[**[conflict]{.mark}**, air, maritime, and land assets would contest
control of]{.underline} critical circum-[Arctic regions]{.underline}. If
the situation escalated, **[[nuclear missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}**
from both sides [[would cross]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Arctic]{.mark}
on ballistic trajectories]{.underline}. Consequently, [[**close
attention** is paid to]{.underline}]{.mark} any increment or reduction
in [regional military capability]{.underline} (see e.g., Poulin 2016),
[and]{.underline} the [continued [**presence**, or]{.mark}]{.underline}
future [[**absence** of Greenland as a **sovereign polity**]{.mark}
from]{.underline} the [balance of power [would
influence]{.mark}]{.underline} the [political [symmetry that underpins
current **stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Shi (2019 and citations therein) identifies four principal
[[**incentives** behind]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[demand for
Greenlandic independence]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, a long-term growth
in the confidence of Greenlandic people with respect to the management
of domestic and foreign affairs. Citing Beukel, Jensen, and Rytter (2010
30), Shi notes the Second World War (WWII) as a turning point in this
regard, as it brought contact with external actors other than Danes.
Second, [[increased prosperity in a more
**diversified**]{.underline}]{.mark} and efficient
**[[economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Third, a long-term dissatisfaction
with Denmark at an emotional level, relating to the colonial past. And
finally, the sense of identity among indigenous Greenlandic people and a
related growing national identity. [However]{.underline}, the
[[desire]{.mark} for independence [is **nuanced**. While a
poll]{.mark}]{.underline} in [2016 [indicated a]{.mark} 64-percent
[majority]{.mark} among]{.underline} the [Greenlandic people [for full
autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline} (Skydsbjerg and Turnowsky 2016), [a 2017
[survey revealed]{.mark} a 78-percent [opposition if it entailed]{.mark}
a [fall in living standards]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bjerregaard 2017).

The [political process leading toward independence has been
protracted]{.underline}. A 1953 change to the Danish constitution
incorporated Greenland into Denmark as a province, conferring
parliamentary representation (constituteproject.org 2021). Home rule was
granted in 1979 with defense, together with foreign affairs, currency,
and the legal system remaining under the jurisdiction of Denmark.2
Following a 2008 referendum (Göcke 2009), a 2009 self-rule law granted
the Greenlandic government (Naalakkersuisut) extensive rights, including
autonomy with respect to the legal system, law enforcement, the Coast
Guard, and foreign affairs in matters relating exclusively to Greenland
and those responsibilities transferred under the Act.3 The powers
granted to Naalakkersuisut did not limit the Danish authorities'
constitutional responsibility and powers in foreign and security policy.
However, the [Act authorized [Greenland]{.mark} to **declare** full
[independence, subject to approval by]{.mark} a **[referendum]{.mark}**
of the Greenlandic people]{.underline}.

[[Despite **reservations**]{.mark} among]{.underline} the [Greenlandic
population]{.underline}, the [[drive toward independence **has**
momentum]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the question of how the Greenland
government would exercise sovereign authority with respect to defense is
now becoming urgent. Greenland, together with the Faroe Islands, is
assuming greater authority in foreign affairs and defense, having
recently signed terms of reference with Denmark for the creation of a
special contact committee to discuss matters of national and common
interests (Danilov 2021). This agreement comes against the backdrop of a
cabinet reshuffle in the Greenland government, in which the premier took
personal charge of foreign affairs, relieving the foreign minister of
those responsibilities (McGwin 2021). The action follows publication of
a news article in which the minister was reported as questioning whether
non-Inuit individuals should be permitted to participate in a vote on
Greenland's independence (McGwin 2021). While the minister regarded the
article as misinterpreting his comments (McGwin 2021), the premier's
response underlines the sensitivity and currency of the independence
question. At the same time, a general increase in international tension
is reflected in perceptions of the Arctic as a potential future
battlespace. As Faroe Islands' Prime Minister Bárður á Steig Nielsen
observed: "The North Atlantic and the Arctic are increasingly in the
spotlight of security policy, and therefore the active participation of
the Faroe Islands and Greenland is also of growing importance" (cited in
Danilov 2021).

//jwh

The European Union's recent [[move to **coax Greenland** into]{.mark}
increased **economic cooperation**]{.underline}, particularly [in terms
of **[resource extraction]{.mark}**, is]{.underline} [a thinly [veiled
attempt to make **inroads** into]{.mark}]{.underline} what is set to be
the stage for a [compelling [geopolitical
**struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a [**hidden** element behind
this]{.underline} seemingly straightforward [economic move: Greenland's
potential **autonomy** in the future also [holds **massive security
implications**]{.mark}. The]{.underline} small population of 65,000
residing on the [world's **largest** island]{.underline} has
[over]{.underline} the past few years [advocated for **independence**
from Denmark]{.underline}. However, what seems to be a relatively
localised issue actually [hides **simmering** [international
**tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which could likely [[cause a rat
race]{.mark} among global powers [for increased **influence** over
Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, it [contains]{.underline} the
[**resplendent** lure of **vast untapped** resources]{.underline} while
also [serving as a potential gateway to the Arctic]{.underline}.

The Rocky Relationship between Greenland and Denmark

The [**crux** of the issue]{.underline} really [began about a
**millennium** ago]{.underline}. The story [goes that an Icelandic
delinquent, **Eriksson**]{.underline} the Red, was [sent to the island
in **exile**]{.underline}. Realising the vast swathes of empty space
(warmer at the time) had potential, he [**circulated** this information
back **home**]{.underline}. Armed with curiosity, the [ever-enthusiastic
Norsemen began sending **expeditions**]{.underline}. A slew of
settlements came up, many religiously influenced by Norway's adherence
to the church, eventually [setting **Christianity** on a **collision
course** with the population]{.underline} that had expanded towards the
north of the island---[the **Inuit**]{.underline}. Although the Viking
presence on the island would fizzle out, these endeavours were
eventually cited as historical justification for [Denmark's **colonial**
project]{.underline} in the 18th century. [Funded by the
**king**]{.underline}, the Alchemist-Pastor Hans Egede had
[undertaken]{.underline} a [mission to spread **Lutheran** beliefs
across Greenland]{.underline}. In reality, this [served as a
**smokescreen** for Danish merchants to fill their **pockets** with the
vast natural resources]{.underline} that lay ripe for the taking [on the
island]{.underline}. With time, this two-fold approach became more
evident, as the monopolisation of trade on the island by the Royal
Greenland Trading Department in 1776 was synchronous with an increased
push for Christianization of the Inuits. Indeed, so goes the age-old
colonial strategy of matching economic exploitation with claims of
"civilising" native populations. Even after World War 2, subtle forms of
colonial dominance persisted, with accusations that Danish elites
fuelled a belief in the exiguous agency of the island's residents.

However, the [[**discourse** regarding Greenland]{.mark}'s own
**culture** and **[autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline} inadvertently took
stead towards the end of the 20th century, [**culminating** in the
[]{.mark}**devolution** of certain functions]{.underline} away from the
Danish government, resulting in "home rule status" being provided in
1979. The following decades saw an [increased push to **galvanise** upon
this]{.underline}, with the 2009 "Act on Greenland Self Government"
essentially [placing most **tenets** of **economics** and **welfare** in
the hands of the regional government]{.underline}, with Copenhagen
desperately grasping onto decisions relating to security and foreign
policy. The [gradual **unravelling** of this process]{.underline}
resulted in the 2023 draft constitution, meant [to **spearhead**
Greenland into a new **era** of independence. An era signifying
**cultural** and **economic** autonomy]{.underline}, with a
parliamentary republic and no Danish monarchy looming over the 90
percent Inuit population. **[If only it were so simple]{.underline}**

The Complicated Question of Independence

If Greenland were to go ahead and push for complete secession, this
would by no means be a smooth-sailing process. For starters, the glaring
elephant in the room is the fact that the Danish Government annually
provides a grant of approximately half a billion euros to Greenland, a
whopping sum covering over half of Greenland's public budget. Cutting
this off overnight would be catastrophic in a similar vein to
post-Soviet shock therapy. The transition has to be a phased one, and
even then, fine-tuning the details will be logistically cumbersome.

The search for alternative sources to make the economy tick does yield
some options, but these all have limitations. Growing the fishing
industry, which has been a staple for them throughout history, is a
lucrative but insufficient option. People are used to a high standard of
living, and one of the preconditions for secession has been to ensure no
reduction from this standard. Current domestic industries will likely be
insufficient to meet this expectation. This is exacerbated by a lack of
infrastructural development, with railroads, roads, and other forms of
transportation significantly lacking. Their marked remoteness and lack
of self-sufficiency would not help this situation and would eventually
make them excessively dependent on imports. What can, however, fulfil
these gaping deficiencies is the subject of much contention: mining and
extraction.

As the effects of global warming tear through the island, reducing ice
cover by approximately 100 billion metric tonnes annually, the ground
yields new evidence of vast mineral deposits. [Like **moths** to
**flames**, major **corporations** have **swarmed** towards [the
prospect of fresh sources to **exploit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
this would definitely be a way out for Greenland from an economic
perspective, this remains a rather unpopular proposition. The last
elections in 2021 raged primarily around the issue of rare earth and
uranium mining in Kvanefjeld (under an Australian firm). Allegations
that projects such as these would [[cause]{.mark} **significant**
environmental **degradation**]{.underline} and would [**incur** the
**risk** of **radioactive** exposure]{.underline}. While striking a
balance between economic interests and natural conservation could be a
way forward, the staunchly anti-mining coalition government renders
legislation that strikes a genuine compromise unlikely. Thus, mining
also does not seem like an immediately feasible solution, which brings
us to more political considerations... Can Greenland turn to others for
help?

Greenland's potential role in the [[**competition** to **militarise**
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}

The 2023 draft constitution contained a free association, essentially
signalling that an independent Greenland could initially place some
degree of dependence on some external actor. Such a proposition is
attractive for many.

In 2019, there was an odd controversy when Donald Trump admitted that
the USA was considering buying Greenland, likening it to a real estate
sale. While this is not exactly a feasible venture given the importance
of sovereignty in contemporary international law, there is nonetheless
some interesting information to be extracted from it. [[If
Greenland]{.mark} were to [become **independent**, the USA would]{.mark}
more than likely [come **knocking** at their **door**]{.mark} for
increased strategic **cooperation**]{.underline}. They would not even be
starting from scratch, given that there are existing American military
installations, [including the large **Thule air base**]{.underline}
present on the northwestern edge of the island. The reason behind
Greenland's importance is simple. The [**melting Arctic** can be [easily
**militarised** through]{.mark} access from [the
island]{.mark}]{.underline}. New polar routes would pit Russia and the
USA in uncomfortable proximity, making it essential for both sides to
make up ground quickly.

At the same time, [**neglecting** China]{.underline} from this
discussion [would also be **premature**]{.underline}, despite its
physical distance. Hypothetically, [if [an independent
Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline} opted not to join NATO, [this [would
provide **China** and **Russia**]{.mark} with the **impetus** [to make
headway into **influencing** their economies and
**policies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Confronted with an opportunity to
make the first move in consolidating control over the northern sea
route, as well as the vast oil and energy resources along it
(potentially 10--30 percent of the world's undiscovered reserves),
[[**neither** major power]{.mark} would be [likely to **hold
back**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, [being able to **implement**
the polar sea rout]{.underline}, would [[prove]{.underline}]{.mark} to
be [[**extremely handy** for China's economic
**expansion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Thus goes the [tale of [a **brewing competition** between major
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}, set to [[take place]{.mark} in a region
that could **prove** [to be the most **prominent**]{.mark} [geopolitical
**arena**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the coming decades, [with
**questions** of **autonomy**]{.underline}, military, trade,
exploitation, and secession all melding together. At the centre of it
all lies peaceful, serene Greenland.

Yet the [**failings** and [**frustrations** of U.S. **strategy**
were]{.mark} **certainly** [**no greater** than]{.mark} those
**encountered** in [**Vietnam**, **Korea**, or other **Cold War**

accomplished]{.mark}]{.underline}. It was not inevitable that the
post--Cold War environment would prove to be as relatively benign as it
was. Quite the opposite: in the early 1990s, some [leading
**international relations** scholars]{.underline} believed that the
world was [entering a **new era** of **vicious
competition**]{.underline} and instability. "**[We will soon miss the
Cold War]{.underline}**," John Mearsheimer warned; rampant nuclear
proliferation, geopolitical revisionism, and even [**great-power
crises** and wars were **likely**]{.underline} as the [**end** of
**bipolarity** unleashed **international** demons]{.underline} that had
been pent up for forty-five years. Yet [[for all the ills]{.mark} that
afflicted the post-Cold war world]{.underline}---humanitarian crises,
regional conflicts, and catastrophic terrorism, among others---[[what is
**highlighted**]{.mark} stands out [is the role of **continued**
American **engagement** in keeping]{.mark} the more [**positive** trends
going and **stifling**]{.mark} the sources of greater **[geopolitical
upheaval]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As William Wohlforth has noted,
[[American primacy]{.mark} and activism [acted as a]{.mark} powerful
[**deterrent** to **great-power conflict** by creating]{.mark} enormous
[**disincentives** for **Russia**, **China**]{.mark}, or other actors
[to **incur**]{.mark} the "[focused **enmity**]{.mark}" of the United
States. The persistence and even [extension of]{.mark} the [U.S.
**security blanket** smothered **potential instability**]{.mark} in
unsettled regions]{.underline} such as Eastern Europe, while removing
any possibility of German or Japanese revanchism---a prospect much
feared in the early 1990s---by keeping those countries tightly lashed to
Washington. [American [**intervention** helped **extinguish** bloody
**conflicts** in the **Balkans** **before** they could **spread** to
neighboring countries; U.S.]{.mark} diplomatic and **military**
[pressure kept **aggressive tyrannies**]{.mark} such as **Iraq**,
**Iran**, and **North Korea** [**bottled** up and helped **slow** the
**spread** of nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.S. support helped
[democratic forces **triumph**]{.underline} in countries from Haiti to
Poland, as the [**number** of democracies **rose**]{.underline} from 76
in 1990 to 120 in 2000; America [**crucially assisted** the **advance**
of globalization]{.underline} and the **[broad prosperity]{.underline}**
that came with it by promoting pro-market policies and providing the
[**necessary** climate of **reassurance** and
**stability**]{.underline}.

#### Great power war causes extinction\-\--It's a threat multiplier.

//jwh

At some point in the [21st century, [an **unwinnable war** may be
**fought**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[A **modern** great power war]{.mark} could [see **nuclear
weapons**, **bioweapons**, **autonomous weapons**, and other
**destructive** **new tech**nologies deployed]{.mark} on
an [**unprecedented** scale]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It would probably be the [**most destructive** event]{.underline} in
history, [[**shattering** our world]{.underline}]{.mark}. It could
[even [**threaten** us with **extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

We've come [**perilously** close to]{.underline} just [this kind of
**catastrophe**]{.underline} before.

On October 27, 1962 --- near the peak of the **[Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.underline}** --- an American [**U-2** reconnaissance
plane]{.underline} set out on a routine mission to the Arctic to collect
data on Soviet nuclear tests. But, [while **flying** near the North
Pole]{.underline}, with the stars obscured by the northern lights, the
[pilot made a **navigation error** and **strayed** into **Soviet
airspace**]{.underline}.1

[Soviet]{.underline} commanders [sent fighter jets to
**intercept**]{.underline} the American plane. The jets were [picked up
by **American radar** operators and **nuclear-armed F-102 fighters**
took off]{.underline} to protect the U-2.

Fortunately, the reconnaissance pilot realised his error with enough
time to correct course before the Soviet and American fighters met. But
the [**intrusion** **enraged** Soviet Premier **Nikita
Khrushchev**]{.underline}, who was [already on **high alert**
amidst]{.underline} the crisis in **[Cuba]{.underline}**.

"What is this, a provocation?" Khrushchev wrote to US President John F.
Kennedy. "One of your planes violates our frontier during this anxious
time when everything has been put into combat readiness."

[If the U-2's path had strayed **further west**]{.underline}, or the
Soviet fighters had been fast enough to intercept it, this
**[incident]{.underline}** could have [played out **quite differently**.
Both the United States and]{.underline} the [USSR had **thousands** of
**nuclear missiles** **ready to fire**]{.underline}. Instead of a
nearly-forgotten anecdote, the U-2 incident could have been a trigger
for war, like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.

[**[Competition]{.mark}** among]{.underline} the [world's **most
powerful** countries]{.underline} shapes our world today. And whether
it's through [**future incidents** like the lost U-2]{.underline}, or
something else entirely, it's [**plausible** that it [could **escalate**
and lead to a
**major**]{.mark}, devastating **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Is there anything you can do to help avoid such a terrible outcome? It
is, of course, difficult to imagine how any one individual can hope to
influence such world-historical events. Even the most powerful world
leaders often fail to predict the global consequences of their
decisions.

But I think the **[likelihood]{.underline}** and
**[severity]{.underline}** of [great power **war** [makes this]{.mark}
among [the **most pressing** **problems**]{.mark} of our
**time**]{.underline} --- and that some solutions could be impactful
enough that working on them may be one of the highest-impact things to
do with your career.

By taking action, I think we can create a future where the threat of
great power war is a distant memory rather than an ever-present danger.

Summary

[Economic growth and
technological progress]{.underline} have [bolstered]{.underline} the
[arsenals]{.underline} of the world's most powerful countries. That
means the [**next war** between them could be **far
worse**]{.underline} than World War II, the deadliest conflict humanity
has yet experienced.

Could such a war actually occur? We can't rule out the
possibility. Technical accidents or [**diplomatic misunderstandings**
could **spark** a **conflict** that quickly escalates.
Or [**international tension** could cause **leaders** to decide
they're **better off** fighting than
**negotiating**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It seems hard to make progress on this problem. It's also less neglected
than some of the problems that we think are most pressing. There are
certain issues, like making nuclear weapons or military artificial
intelligence systems safer, which seem promising --- although it may be
more impactful to work on reducing risks from AI, bioweapons or nuclear
weapons directly. You might also be able to reduce the chances of
misunderstandings and miscalculations by developing expertise in one of
the most important bilateral relationships (such as that between the
United States and China).

Finally, by making conflict less likely, reducing competitive pressures
on the development of dangerous technology, and improving international
cooperation, you might be helping to reduce other risks, like the chance
of future pandemics.

Our overall view

Working on this issue seems to be among the best ways of improving the
long-term future we know of, but all else equal, we think it's less
pressing than our highest priority areas (primarily because it seems
less neglected and harder to solve).

Scale

There's a **[significant chance]{.underline}** that a [**new** great
power war **occurs** this **century**]{.underline}.

Although the [world's **most powerful** countries]{.underline} haven't
fought directly since World War II, war has been
a [**constant** throughout **human history**]{.underline}. There have
been [**numerous** close
calls]{.underline}, and **[several issues]{.underline}** could
[cause **diplomatic disputes**]{.underline} in the years to come.

These considerations, along with forecasts and statistical models, lead
me to think there's about a one-in-three chance that a new great power
war breaks out in roughly the next 30 years.

Few wars cause more than a million casualties and the next great power
war would probably be smaller than that. However, there's some
[chance [it could **escalate massively**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today the
[great powers have **much** [**larger economies**, **more powerful**
weapons, and **bigger**]{.mark} military **[budgets]{.mark}** than they
did in the past]{.underline}. An all-out war could kill far more
people than even World War II, the worst war we've yet experienced.

### Impact\-\--Imperialism\-\--2NC

#### Secession enables US encroachment\-\--Greenlandic independence creates a geopolitical vacuum that triggers U.S. interventionism to preempt rival influence, deepening militarization and neocolonial control.

**Thorsson '25** \[Elías; February 14; Editor and reporter for Arctic

"[Greenland's independence]{.underline}, if it happens, [will leave a
geopolitical **vacuum**]{.underline}. **[If the U.S. doesn't step in,
someone else will]{.underline}**," [said]{.underline} Alexander B. Gray,
former [**Deputy Assistant** to]{.underline} President
**[Trump]{.underline}** and Senior Fellow in National Security Affairs
at the American Foreign Policy Council, during his testimony.

The hearing, chaired by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), explored
[the]{.underline} economic and military [benefits of acquiring
Greenland]{.underline}, particularly [its **rich cache** of
rare]{.underline} earth **[minerals]{.underline}**, which he claims are
vital for U.S. industries.

"[**Acquiring** Greenland would have **enormous** economic
**benefits**]{.underline} for the United States," Cruz said.
"[The]{.underline} island's natural resources like [rare earth elements
would **strengthen** American supply chains]{.underline} and industries.
The island's strategic location in the Arctic would [provide **huge
advantages** in monitoring]{.underline} growing [**Russian** and
**Chinese bellicosity**]{.underline} in the region."

U.S. interests

[Greenland]{.underline}, which is currently an autonomous territory of
Denmark, [has been taking steps toward **full sovereignty**, a move
that]{.underline} could [leave it **politically**]{.underline} and
economically **[vulnerable]{.underline}**.

[If Greenland were to **break away** from Denmark without strong
**Western backing**]{.underline}, it could [become an **easy target**
for Chinese and Russian influence]{.underline}, Gray warned.

"[We need to be **proactive**]{.underline}, [not
**reactive**]{.underline}. If Greenland becomes independent, [we must be
the **first to offer** a deal]{.underline} that keeps them aligned with
the United States," he urged.

Two Options for U.S. Engagement

During his testimony, [**Gray** laid out]{.underline} two different
responses to Greenlandic independence:

[Turning Greenland into a **U.S. Territory**]{.underline}

This would place Greenland in a similar status as Puerto Rico or Guam,
[making it **part** of the U.S.]{.underline} while still allowing some
degree of self-governance.

The U.S. would [take control of **security**, **trade**, and **economic
development**]{.underline}, securing Greenland's vast natural resources
while expanding military operations in the Arctic.

#### That creates imperial conquest\-\--Threats of annexation provoke transatlantic backlash, collapse U.S. alliances, and trigger geopolitical isolation.

If [Trump is **serious**]{.underline} about this move---and so far, it
appears that he may be---[the]{.underline} incoming [**administration**

politician Rasmus [Jarlov]{.underline}, [who **heads** the Danish

"[To the **extent** that U.S.]{.underline} activities [aim to take
control of Danish territory]{.underline}, [it must be **prohibited** and
**countered**]{.underline}. Then they can't be there at all." German
Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also
both [**warned** against **any moves** by Trump]{.underline}, with
Scholz explicitly [saying]{.underline}: "[The principle of the
**inviolability** of borders applies to **every** country]{.underline},
regardless of whether it lies to the east of us or the west, [and every
state must keep to it]{.underline}, [regardless of whether it is a
**small** country or a **very powerful** state]{.underline}."

4\. What is the endgame for Trump?

Europe-watchers should expect Trump and his team to get hooked on this
idea of acquiring Greenland. That means [it will]{.underline} not only
[be a source of **transatlantic contention**]{.underline} for the next
four years, but could also be used [as a]{.underline}n attempted
[**bargaining tool** in Trump's]{.underline} economic [**confrontation**
with **Europe**]{.underline}.\
\<\<\<SHRUNKEN AND CONDENSED FOR READABILITY\>\>\>

---Rachel Rizzo Trump's threats may be mere trolling. Trump seems to
relish saying things that send people scurrying, chattering, and
expressing outrage. Trump may also be seeking, as former Congressman Tom
Malinowski shrewdly suggested, to distract from the difficulty of
fulfilling the promises that got him elected, like lowering prices.
Trump's threats may also be designed to throw Denmark and Greenland off
balance as a prelude to some sort of negotiation under pressure, which
Trump can then tout as a success for "America First." In no case is the
United States likely to start wars against allies and friends. For one
thing, Trump would own the consequences, which would include hostile
populations under occupation, a ruined NATO alliance system, and US
isolation from its friends, to the delight of its adversaries Russia and
China. Trump won election promising to end wars, not start new ones.
---Daniel Fried While the president-elect's desire to purchase Greenland
outright may seem outlandish, former Trump administration officials have
made convincing arguments for the island to enter into a free
association compact with the United States in the event it decides to
seek independence from Denmark, thereby securing its territorial
integrity while achieving national independence. ---Christian Bjørn
Følsgaard 5. What does this say about Trump's approach to global affairs
for the next four years?

On a deeper level, [Trump's]{.underline} threats of [**war** and
**annexation** speak to]{.underline} a way of thinking about [**power**
in the world that goes back to the **nineteenth century**]{.underline}
and before---power [through **territorial conquest**]{.underline}---and
[**turns away** from US grand strategy]{.underline} starting in the
twentieth century.

US grand strategy after 1945 was based on the idea that the United
States could be a friend of all nations that shared its core values, and
it has brought generations of general peace and prosperity. No doubt
this strategy needs another adjustment to meet the times. But
[**throwing out** US grand strategy in **favor of war**]{.underline},
territorial **[conquest]{.underline}**, **[occupation]{.underline}**,
[and **threats**]{.underline} would not make the United States great
again. It would [make the United States a]{.underline} mere [mimic of
**Putinism** and a reflection of the **mid-twentieth** century aggressor
nations of **Germany**]{.underline}, **[Italy]{.underline}**, [and
**Japan**]{.underline}.

Trump's threats may be bluster or tactical, but they [reveal a **dark
side** of power **unworthy** of **any** US president]{.underline}. Put
into practice, they would [reduce the **U**nited **S**tates to a **mere
bully** that rules through **force** and **fear**]{.underline},
assuredly triggering a reaction against it, as well as [**ending** US
**alliances**]{.underline}. That's quite a degeneration from the
tradition that Trump inherits.

#### Extinction\-\--US imperialism create endless violence and war.

in Said's words, usually entails]{.underline} "**[more destruction and

in a disordered world on the **brink** of **catastrophe** to reflect on
the **nature**]{.underline} of Sykes--Picot, to stop and think
[**seriously** about the **history** of **power**]{.underline} lurking
behind the looming crisis. Rather, in the minds of liberal
internationalists, [America is both the **hegemonic power** that
**sews** together]{.underline} the strands of liberal civilization in a
[disordered world and **perennially** in peril]{.underline}.38 This
temporally compressed vision reduces the aspirations of all the people
in a region as fraught with [recent **imperial** history as the Middle

oversaw Iran's ballistic missile and drone offensives against Israel.
Moreover, [[Iran's **ballistic**]{.mark} [missile

[**[weakened]{.mark}** the **[power projection]{.mark}**

and Hezbollah, [[which it]{.mark} had [**counted** on]{.mark} to

### UQ\-\--Independence\-\--2NC

#### Greenland is distracted by Trump's remarks\-\--won't pursue independence now.

//jwh

[[**Early** on]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} election [campaign focused
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[anger]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
frustration [aimed [at]{.mark} historical **wrongdoings** by
[Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Julie Rademacher, a
consultant and former adviser to Greenland\'s government.

\"[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} I think [[the **fear** of the U.S.
**imperialist** approach]{.underline}]{.mark} has [**lately** [become
**bigger** than the **anger** towards Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
said Rademacher.

Reuters spoke to [[**more** than a **dozen**
Greenlanders]{.underline}]{.mark} in Nuuk, all of whom said they
favoured independence, although many [[expressed **concern**
that]{.mark} a **swif[t]{.mark}** [transition could **damage** the
economy and **eliminate**]{.mark} Nordic [welfare

schooling.

\"[We don\'t want to be **part** of the U.S.]{.underline} for obvious
reasons; healthcare and Trump,\" said Tuuta Lynge-Larsen, a bank
employee and Nuuk resident, adding that this election was especially
important. \"We don\'t like the attention, to put it short.\"

#### Greenland eyes independence ahead of 2025 elections\-\--but only if economic stability is guaranteed, making Danish subsidies and foreign investment decisive to secession's viability.

//jwh

[[**Greenland** is a **small economy** with]{.mark} just]{.underline}
short of [[**60,000** people]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is an
[**autonomous** territory of]{.underline} the Kingdom of
**[Denmark]{.underline}** (along with Denmark and the Faroe Islands). It
has "home rule" which means that it controls most domestic matters while
[Denmark]{.underline} still [has **control** over **foreign
affairs**]{.underline}, such as defence, along with monetary policy and
citizenship -- all people of Greenland are Danish citizens and enjoy the
same rights as citizens in Denmark. The [[country's **economy**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} mainly [[**centred** around]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[fishing]{.underline}]{.mark}** industry and a growing tourism
sector, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[has some **mining**]{.mark}
**activity**]{.underline} (it currently has two active mines). The
public sector makes up around half of domestic employment.

The [country is]{.underline} also [[**very dependent** on]{.mark}
**support** from [the **Danish**]{.mark}]{.underline} government in form
of the "bloktilskud", a block grant, which is around half of the
government revenue. [[**50%** of its **exports**]{.mark} is to Denmark
[and **60%** of]{.mark} its [**imports** are from
Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Elections in April 2025: independence at the heart of the debate

[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} will have an
**[[election]{.underline}]{.mark}** by April 2025, which will
[certainly]{.underline} be [[**focused** on Greenland's]{.mark}
**future** and **possible** **[independence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This was highlighted by [the **current** **[prime minister]{.mark}**,
Múte B. **[Egede]{.mark}**]{.underline}, of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party
-- a socialist party with a focus on the country's independence. In his
New Year's Adress, he [said]{.underline} that [the **coming term** of
office]{.underline} would [[put down a]{.mark} **commission** that would
**define** what **qualifies** a]{.underline} legitimate
**[[referendum]{.underline}]{.mark}**, what question should be posed and
how long the campaign should be. This comes on the back of another
commission on a Greenlandic constitution which was presented in April
2023 to the regional parliament that would be enacted once the country
is independent.

Practically, [once the **referendum commission** has
**concluded**]{.underline} on how a referendum is to be conducted, [it
can be **declared**. [If the result]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
referendum [[is a **yes**]{.underline}]{.mark} to independence, [then
the [Danish parliament would **have** to **agree**]{.mark}]{.underline}
which it is expected to comply with given that only two minor parties
have indicated that they would oppose it.

#### Greenland will remain part of Denmark for the future. Independently, granting Asian states solves the impact of the DA.

//jwh

[[Greenland will **remain** in]{.underline}]{.mark} some form of
[[**union** with Denmark for the]{.mark} **foreseeable
[future]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One reason for
[[Copenhagen]{.underline}]{.mark} to support [[granting Asian states
observer status]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic Council was to make
it easier to find investors for Greenland and the Faroe Islands. That in
turn [[**improves** its **relationship** with the]{.mark} **two**
[autonomous **territories** and weakens]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**centrifugal** forces]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Realm. These
intentions are subsidiary to Denmark's central foreign policy objective:
[[**avoiding harm** to]{.mark} its [relationships with the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} with [the
**E**]{.mark}uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion]{.underline}, and to its own
privileged position in the Arctic. The new trilateral agreement for the
US base in Thule is suited to further these interests.

#### Full sovereignty is far off in the squo. 

**Keldorff '25** \[Peter; March 11; International correspondent from
Denmark for Al Jazeera; Al Jazeera, "'Historic moment': Greenland steps
into global spotlight ahead of election," 'Historic moment': Greenland
steps into global spotlight ahead of election\] //jwh

While the level of self-governance has expanded over the years, [[**full
sovereignty** remains a distant]{.underline}]{.mark} yet powerful
[**[aspiration]{.mark}** for many **Greenlanders**]{.underline} -- and
the issue is at the heart of the snap election that was called after
Trump underscored his ambitions.

In the run-up to the vote, Nuuk has been overrun with international
journalists taking an unusually keen interest in Greenlandic politics.

Among the questions being continually asked: Will Greenland take
concrete steps towards breaking away from Denmark, or will economic
realities keep it tethered to Copenhagen?

"[I **don't** think full independence will happen **anytime
soon**]{.underline} -- it has always been a factor in Greenlandic
elections. However, [[I **don't** see it happening **quickly**, even
though]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[political parties are **pushing** for
it. Maybe in **20** to **30 years**]{.underline}]{.mark}," **[Maria
Ackren]{.underline}**, a [**professor** of **political
science**]{.underline} at Greenland University, told Al Jazeera.

"[Almost **every** party in Greenland supports independence.
However]{.underline}, the **[[timing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **pace** of the process
**vary**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

#### Greenland's dependence on Danish subsidies, weak economy, and geopolitical entanglements prevent sudden independence\-\--Long-term autonomy requires gradual integration, not rupture.

A Pragmatic Approach to Independence,"
eiir.eu/international-law/international-law-cases/greenlands-path-to-sovereignty-a-pragmatic-approach-to-independence\]
//jwh

[Greenland remains **very** dependent on Denmark]{.underline} with
annual subsidies amounting to nearly one-third of its GDP. The biggest
challenge towards becoming a sovereign Nation is reducing its economic
dependence while ensuring that potential international partnerships and
alliances do not result in undue foreign influence. In order to achieve
this, [Greenland]{.underline} must find viable sectors, such as
renewable resources, fisheries, and responsible mining, to create a
sovereign economy. Additionally, it [must also **shield** itself
against]{.underline} excessive [dependence on foreign
powers]{.underline}, most [notably]{.underline} China and [the
**U.S**]{.underline}., [which are]{.underline} becoming [**very**
interested in the rare earth minerals]{.underline} within Greenland.
Meanwhile, the [path towards]{.underline} complete [sovereignty
**must**]{.underline} also [occur in a **gradual** manner]{.underline}.
It should be a step-by-step process by which the nation would
increasingly assume control of core areas such as foreign affairs and
the management of natural resources while maintaining economic and
political linkages with the Danish government. This would prevent the
nation from facing abrupt economic instability or pressures from the
global world which would counteract its long-term objectives.

Greenland's path towards autonomy is not occurring in isolation. The
geopolitical value of the island means the global powers including the
U.S. and NATO are also invested in ensuring stability within the region.
The Arctic is becoming the new arena for geopolitical competition with
increased military presence from Russia and China. As Greenland heads
toward autonomy, it needs to proactively interact with the institutions
of the region such as the Arctic Council to make itself a cooperative
and responsible partner. Furthermore, good diplomatic relations with the
U.S. and Denmark are also crucial. The fact that there is Thule Air Base
is a testament to Washington's strategic interest and therefore
Greenland must treat its relationship with the U.S. with caution. Any
future agreements regarding the military presence must be open and
beneficial for the future security and economic advancement of
Greenland.

Moreover, sovereignty for Greenland [must]{.underline} also
**[prioritize]{.underline}** the [**well-being** of]{.underline} its
[aboriginal people]{.underline}. It is imperative that [its
path]{.underline} to independence [does **not** come at the **expense**
of social cohesion]{.underline} or environmental stewardship. The
policies must be written with the preservation of cultural identity, the
establishment of economic opportunities for all citizens, and the
protection against environmental degradation associated with resource
extraction.

#### Greenland lacks the capacity to manage defense or governance alone\-\--Leaders admit independence is utopian in the short-term and risks U.S. domination without Denmark's backing.

"There's a [**misconception** that Greenland is going to be independent
**tomorrow**]{.underline}," said Chemnitz, MP for IA. "[It is a
**long-term** goal]{.underline}."

Relations with Denmark have long been complicated by scandals over
enforced sterilisation of Greenlanders and the racism they have faced.
Egede said in his new year address that Greenland needed to throw off
"the shackles of colonialism".

Some argue Greenland has come a long way. It received home rule in 1979
and more rights 30 years later, including to seek independence. "If we
should define ourselves, we should say we are the only nation of
indigenous people who have their own right to their land and resources,"
said Aqqaluk Lynge, founder of IA. "You don't find that arrangement
anywhere else in the world."

But Greenland has not used all its potential powers. More than 30 still
reside with Denmark, including policing, defence and security. Some in
the capital Nuuk argue [it will take **decades** to be able to
**afford** to run]{.underline} most [things independently]{.underline}.

But not everyone is prepared to wait that long. Naleraq, the party to
which the two Siumut politicians defected, has welcomed Trump's interest
and said they want to start independence talks with Copenhagen straight
away.

Kuno Fencker, a Greenlandic MP who is one of the defectors, said: "It's
good for Greenland to get all this attention. Suddenly Denmark is
behaving very nicely. Suddenly they could solve some problems
immediately."

Even he, however, sees the limits of Greenland's push for nationhood.
"[We know we can't be **fully** independent]{.underline} . . . [It's
**utopia** to think that Greenland can handle]{.underline} defence and
security with [a population of **57,000**]{.underline} people and an
area larger than western Europe . . . The US will be the ones to defend
this island," he added, pointing at the current US base, the main
military installation on Greenland, on the north of the island.

Denmark itself has reacted cautiously, with Prime Minister Mette
Frederiksen keen not to inflame tensions with either the US or
Greenland. She has said Greenlanders' desire for independence is
"legitimate and understandable". Many in Nuuk say she is the most
friendly Danish prime minister ever towards them.

Some Danish politicians argue [Greenland]{.underline} would be [**best**
sticking with Copenhagen]{.underline}, otherwise they risk being snapped
up by the US. "This [US **aggression** makes it **harder** for Greenland
to become independent]{.underline}. Then they would have to face the
Americans alone, rather than together with Denmark," said Rasmus Jarlov,
a former minister and current Conservative MP.

#### Three-quarters of Greenlanders voted for cautious autonomy over full independence\-\--Election results show overwhelming rejection of rushed separation from Denmark.

**Filippov '25** \[Anton; March 13; Journalist at European Pravda;

[Greenland]{.underline}, once a colony and now an autonomous territory
of the Kingdom of Denmark, gained the right to have its own parliament
in 1979.

The island [does **not** make independent decisions]{.underline} in
matters [related to the]{.underline} national
**[constitution]{.underline}**, **[citizenship]{.underline}**, [the
**S**]{.underline}upreme **[C]{.underline}**ourt,
**[foreign]{.underline}**, **[defense]{.underline}**, [and **security
policy**]{.underline}, as well as monetary policy.

In return, Greenland receives an annual subsidy from Denmark of over
€500 million for social welfare. Given the island\'s population of fewer
than 57,000, this translates to more than €17,000 per capita.

During this campaign, Danish officials made a point of emphasising their
non-interference in Greenlandic affairs, reaffirming in response to
Trump that \"the island is not for sale\" and that its fate lies solely
in the hands of its residents.

Pre-election polls showed that while most Greenlanders favour
[independence]{.underline}, there is [**no consensus** on **when** it
should happen or **how** it would **impact**]{.underline} their standard
of [living]{.underline}.

As a result, three-quarters of [Greenlanders]{.underline} voted for
parties advocating a cautious approach to independence.

Unexpectedly, the center-right Democrats party emerged as the winner,
securing nearly 30% of the vote (compared to just 9% in the previous
election).

Historically [**sceptical** of **full** independence]{.underline}, the
Democrats favour expanded autonomy within the Danish Kingdom. Although
their platform envisions an independent Greenland with a free-market
economy, they [warn against **hasty moves** that]{.underline} could
[**harm** people's livelihoods]{.underline} and the economy.

#### The Danish monarchy's enduring popularity and cultural ties complicate separation\-\--Greenlanders favor gradual change over severing longstanding symbolic bonds.

While many [Greenlanders **dream** of independence]{.underline} from
Denmark, [the king **remains popular**]{.underline} on the island,
having [spent]{.underline} extended periods there, including a
[**four-month** expedition on the ice sheet]{.underline}. Last month,
t[he royal court **modified** its coat of arms]{.underline},
[enlarging]{.underline} a [**polar bear** that symbolizes

in Denmark]{.underline} to deal with this issue right now [because he
has a **long** history with]{.underline} Greenland,\" Damien Degeorges,
a Reykjavik-based consultant specializing in Greenland, told Reuters.

\"He\'s popular in Greenland. So [he can **clearly** be **helpful** to
the Danish-Greenlandic **relationship**]{.underline}.\"

#### Full independence would sever Danish aid and impose massive sovereign burdens\-\--No feasible path exists to cover defense, welfare, and institutional costs solo.

[If Greenland achieves **full** independence]{.underline}, it's likely
that all economic transfers from Denmark would cease. Additionally, the
Danish Parliament and government need to decide whether future citizens
of Greenland should have visa-free access to Denmark and the right to
residence permits in the country. Questions also arise about whether
there should be access to the Danish job market and if specialized
services in health care and higher education should remain available.

[How Greenland will **manage**]{.underline} its [foreign and security
policy remains **uncertain**]{.underline}, although the 1951 Defense
Agreement outlines U.S. rights concerning Greenland. If Greenland aims
to pursue its own interests regarding foreign, defense, and security
policies, Greenlanders must clarify how this will be managed. This would
[involve **insurmountable** economic **costs**]{.underline} if Greenland
were responsible for bearing the expenses of enforcing sovereignty,
maintaining a standing defense, and other military capabilities. Hence,
[full]{.underline} independence with all its [implications
is]{.underline} nearly [an **impossibility**]{.underline} for Greenland.

Another possibility might involve negotiating a new status for
Greenland's relationship with Denmark in connection with independence.
Greenland could gain independence while the [Danish
government]{.underline} and Parliament agree to [**continue**
funding]{.underline} substantial financial support for Greenland.
Additionally, individual rights of Greenlanders within Danish society
might be maintained. However, it seems [**unrealistic** that Denmark
would **bear** these costs]{.underline} or grant such privileges if
foreign and security policy matters were disentangled from the Kingdom
of Denmark and [made **sovereignly** controlled by

agrees, [say]{.underline}ing that \"you could argue that the recent
election results indicate a firm rejection of U.S. territorial
ambitions.\"

[As for **independence**]{.underline}, [it\'s]{.underline} \"[going to
be]{.underline} a little bit more of [a **cautious**
approach]{.underline},\" he says. \"Many in Greenland think, \'Well, we
would like to be independent, but we need to secure a very strong
foundation, particularly the economic foundation.\' \"

That sentiment is echoed by Hans Jensen, a mining executive who is
Danish but has worked in Greenland for decades.

\"[Independence is **not** going to happen **any** time
soon]{.underline},\" he says.

But, Jensen adds: \"[Greenlanders are **not interested** in]{.underline}
becoming a [U.S]{.underline}. state. That is what the election showed
--- by making the Democrats the largest party.\"

[[Greenland **relies** upon]{.underline}]{.mark} large block
[[**grants** from the **Danish**]{.mark} government]{.underline}. Under
the Act on Greenland Self-Government, the annual Danish government grant
is DKK3.4 billion (approximately €457 million at 2009 price and wage
levels, and thus adjustable). The Act stipulates that, [[if Greenland
**generates** revenue from **mineral resources**]{.underline}]{.mark}
exceeding DKK75 million per year (slightly more than €10million), [which
has **not been** the **case**]{.underline} to date, [[the **grant** will
be decreased]{.underline}]{.mark} [**by 50%** of the **excess**
amount]{.underline}. In 2023, Denmark provided Greenland with a grant of
DKK4.14 billion (almost €556 million).

5 [[This **accounts** for]{.underline}]{.mark} around [**[half]{.mark}**
of [the government\'s **revenue**]{.mark}]{.underline} and, while
relatively less, still amounts to [approximately [**20%** of
Greenland\'s **g**]{.mark}ross **[d]{.mark}**omestic
**[p]{.mark}**roduct]{.underline}. The Danish government\'s additional
expenses related to Greenland (public order and safety, police services,
military and defence, prisons, courts, general public services, economic
affairs, research, environmental protection and other areas) amounted to
around €204 million in 2023. [Greenland]{.underline} also
[receives]{.underline} around [**€17.29 million annually** from the
**EU**]{.underline} for access to the island\'s Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ)and insupport of its fisheries policy.

[[**Low** economic **diversification**]{.mark}, **strong
[dependency]{.mark}** [on external support]{.mark}]{.underline},an

Greenland\'s]{.mark} **sustainable development** and
**[self-sufficiency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2022, Denmark\'s national
bank published an analysis of the economy, underlining that Greenland\'s
[fiscal **policy** is **unsustainable**]{.underline} and \'public
expenditure cannot be financed under the current taxation rules\', which
is characterised by imbalances and results in low tax revenue, pointing
to a growing need for reform of the tax system and education system. The
Naalakkersuisut is working to address these issues, including through
reforms, exploring the island\'s mining potential, attempting to attract
foreign investment, encouraging international trade and, tourism and
strengthening cooperation with a variety of actors.

[[Greenland's **progress** to]{.underline}]{.mark} political
[[independence]{.underline}]{.mark} appears to be [[at a
**standstill**]{.mark}. Despite **renewed** political
support]{.underline} for the movement, Danish consent to negotiations,
and a high degree of existing autonomy, [Greenland]{.underline} has
[remained **firmly** within]{.underline} the Kingdom of
[Denmark]{.underline}. One of the [[**most important** factors
limiting]{.underline}]{.mark} real political [[**action** is]{.mark} the
state of [Greenland's **economy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Agneman, 2022;
Mazza, 2015). [The country is [**highly incentivized** to remain]{.mark}
under Danish rule [thanks to **critical financial
support**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Agneman, 2022). For example, [a
**quarter** of Greenland's GDP comes **directly** from the **Danish**
government]{.underline}, and an additional ten percent is contributed by
the EU (Rosen, 2016). In any country, losing a quarter of the nation's
GDP virtually overnight would be catastrophic. Furthermore, the
Greenlandic economy serves a relatively small population spread sparsely
across the country. Current economic conditions are simply not conducive
to Greenland becoming independent (Mazza, 2015).

[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}'s extensive [[**deposits** of]{.mark}

This would, however, involve working through Greenland's environmental

Geopolitical Dynamics

[Greenland's **independence**]{.underline} would [[**redefine** the

**Russia** and **China** are **locking horns**]{.mark}]{.underline} to
increase their presence. An independent Greenland would necessitate
greater diplomatic efforts by the US to counter competing influences and
foster cohesion on questions of Arctic governance and security.

Challenges and Considerations

Economic Viability

[[Greenland's economy]{.underline}]{.mark} is [**presently
[dominated]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} subsidies provided by
[[Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in health and education
sectors. [[Becoming]{.mark} **completely
[independent]{.mark}**]{.underline} would [[involve **creating** an
**economy**]{.mark} that **supports itself**, making]{.underline}
responsible [**use** of]{.underline} its [natural
**resources**]{.underline}, and [creating **infrastructure** to **back**
**new industries**]{.underline}.

#### U.S. mining investment underwrites independence\-\--Trump backs mineral extraction to replace Danish aid, using Greenland's resources to secure economic viability and strategic leverage.

[[Even though **Greenland**]{.underline}]{.mark} was officially
[**[granted]{.mark}** the [**opportunity** to **secede**]{.mark} by the
Danish government]{.underline}, the island has [[**chosen not** to
**exercise** this right]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[because of
economic factors. Denmark provides]{.mark} a **[\$600 million]{.mark}**
annual **grant** to the island]{.underline}, which supports over
[**half** of its]{.underline} public **[budget]{.underline}**, including
universal education and healthcare. Without a major change in
Greenland's economy, the island will not be able to single-handedly
support these programs. The [[**Trump**
administration]{.underline}]{.mark} is reportedly [considering
**[offering]{.mark}** to]{.underline} replace or [[**increase** this
**funding** should Greenland **agree** to American
**demands**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but funding could get cut under
American control, effectively swapping out one colonial power for
another. Even if the island developed a more robust economy to avoid
overreliance on foreign powers, Indigenous leaders worry about the
environmental consequences of exploiting the island's mineral reserves.

For Trump, [the island offers]{.underline} an
**[unparalleled]{.underline}** real estate [**opportunity**
[with]{.mark} **huge [reserves]{.mark}** [of **critical
minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline} for green technologies, including copper
and cobalt. These materials are [[vital to **Trump's** "**America
First**" plan]{.underline}]{.mark} to dominate energy production and
counter China, which currently dominates the global market for these
minerals. [Greenland]{.underline} is also an "[**absolute necessity**"
to Trump]{.underline} due to its location in the Arctic, which is
between North America and Europe and not far from Russia; the United
States already operates at least one known military base on the island,
though Trump has made statements referring to multiple US bases being
housed in Greenland. As ice sheets melt, Greenland may also finally
offer a viable Northwest Passage for trade across the Arctic waters of
North America.

exports, [and annual **subsidies** from Denmark]{.underline} that fund
about half of the public budget.

Nathanielsen suggested that [[to establish a **self-sustaining**
economy, Greenland should **prioritize**]{.mark} the [development

five mines, compared to the current single mine.

\'[[an]{.mark} **attractive**]{.underline} and [[**reliable** partner in
the mineral resources **sector**]{.underline}]{.mark}\'that will
[\'[assist in making minerals **available**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
production of renewable sources of energy, thereby doing its part\'to
lower global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Greenland signed
(non-binding) partnership agreements with the US on mineral sector
governance (2019),and with the EU on the development of sustainable raw
materials value chains (2023). Its 2025-2029 mineral resources strategy
underlines its plans to continue implementing the agreement with the EU,
which focuses on cooperation along the whole value chain, and renew the
US agreement, including collaboration on geological hyperspectral data,
marketing and setting framework conditions. [The strategy]{.underline}
also [focuses on further **concrete** initiatives to offer]{.underline}
more [**attractive** investment **frameworks**]{.underline}. In 2024,
[Greenland became a **member** of the **Mineral Security Partnership

There are hopes for [**[profits]{.mark}** resulting

[materials]{.mark}]{.underline} should be [seen as [an
**opportunity**]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as a threat [[to its
**aspirations** for **independence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today about
[**58 percent** of the companies involved in mineral **exploration** in

(from i.a. Denmark, Germany, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom)
**[constitute]{.underline}** only **[15 percent]{.underline}**. Although
[European companies]{.underline} are the owners of three-quarters of all

this kind of activity [[to a **limited** extent]{.underline}]{.mark}

[As a sovereign state [Greenland could]{.mark}]{.underline} still
[[**continue** cooperation with Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark} in
questions of defence and foreign policy, as well as financial policy.
[Copenhagen would have an interest]{.underline} in that, [because
Greenland is the **key** to Denmark's **access** to the
**Arctic**]{.underline} with all its resources and attributes: minerals,
fishing grounds, oil and gas, power and international recognition. In
order to maintain the status associated with this, Copenhagen will have
to invest more in protecting and defending its rights.

As the Arctic polar sea ice melts, shipping traffic has been increasing.
Since 2006 there has also been a growing number of vessels entering
Danish-controlled waters without observing the usual protocols. Cases of
illegal fishing, piracy or terrorism have not yet come to light. But how
should maritime security be ensured as shipping traffic increases?

The [**Royal [Danish Navy]{.mark}** [possesses **three
ice-**]{.mark}**breakers**]{.underline} and [serves [as Greenland's
**coast guard**]{.mark}. The forces in Greenland]{.underline} currently
[[operate **one aircraft**, **four helicopters** and **four
ships**]{.underline}]{.mark} (as well as the legendary Sirius Dog Sled
Patrol) -- to guard the world's largest island with 44,000 kilometers of
coastline. With these personnel and resources, they also have to defend
the sovereignty of the Realm, monitor fisheries, provide maritime
services, transport patients and assist with other social services, as
well as conduct search and rescue (SAR) missions. [[The]{.mark} SAR
[**deficits** in the Arctic are **considerable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Recently there was even the idea, in a blog of the U.S. Naval Institute,
to resume the "Greenland Patrol" which was established by the U.S. Coast
Guard in 1941. Future US aid, the author recommends, should be
ear-marked for port infrastructure to enable them to receive U.S. Coast
Guard (USCG) vessels if the need arises.

Growing Russian military activity has led a number of states to
demonstratively expand their presence in support of Nordic NATO members.
In August 2020, the USS Thomas Hudner became the first Arleigh Burke
class destroyer to enter the deep fjord behind Nuuk; in the same month
Danish and French warships conducted joint exercises with a USCG vessel
off Greenland's west coast. In September, Denmark conducted joint
maneuvers in the Barents Sea with the United States, the United Kingdom
and Norway. In the first such operation for 20 years, naval forces
demonstrated freedom of navigation above the Arctic Circle.

[Copenhagen]{.underline} has to [pursue a **delicate balance** between
its own **scarce** military]{.underline} resources [and]{.underline} the
[**comprehensive** support offered by its **allies**. [An **independent
Greenland** will]{.mark}]{.underline} -- like Iceland -- [[**not** be
able to **defend itself**]{.mark} on its own. [Copenhagen relies on
**support** from the **United States**]{.mark}]{.underline} but has to
avoid any appearance that it is allowing its policies to be dictated by
Washington. Trump's offer exacerbated that problem because his idea was
an "absolutely radical break" with the post-1945 status quo. "When small
nations wake up to the world's superpower threatening to unroot that
relation, it's not something to take lightly," the Danish expert Martin
Breum explained.

#### Greenland has no military\-\--severing ties with Greenland would rid them of any protection from global powers.

This week, the American people and [the [world have become much more
familiar with **Greenland**]{.mark},]{.underline} the world's largest
island. We know that two U.S. presidents, Harry Truman (in 1946) and
[Donald Trump (Friday) have expressed interest in purchasing
it.]{.underline} President Truman **quoted a price of **\$100 million in

offer was moot before it was proffered[**: Greenland is not for sale**,
**but** very much "]{.mark}]{.underline}**[open for business]{.mark}**,"
according to Greenland's foreign minister and the prime minister of
Denmark.

Over the past few days, there have been many questions about the
possible motivations behind the president's interest in and enthusiasm
for Greenland. The next bold real estate move[? A strategic gambit to
bolster U.S. military presence in the Arctic? Or a wily decision to
further cement America's economic dominance?]{.underline} On the latter,
the economics of the Arctic are important to understand.

Six years ago, my think tank conducted a study in which [we examined the
economic benefits of a **[rapidly transforming]{.underline}**
Arctic]{.mark}. While we focused on the United States, our report did
examine Greenland and its rich mineral resources, which include rare
earth elements, uranium, iron ore, gold, diamonds, lead and zinc.
Greenland, like [[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}, Canada and Russia[[, is
home to some of the world's largest nickel, iron ore and zinc
mines.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The discovery of[ ]{.underline}large reserves of rare earth metals is
what has probably [piqued Chinese economic interest in
Greenland]{.underline}. Rare earth elements are essential to a range of
smartphones and other devices, but they also have critical applications
in the defense, automotive and renewal energy industries, including in
wind turbines, hybrid-vehicle motors, missile-guidance systems,
rechargeable batteries for consumer products, night-vision goggles,
alloys for sonar technology and lasers in weapons systems.
The Ilimaussaq complex on the southwestern coast of Greenland holds the
largest quantities of rare earth elements in the world, with an
inventory of 10.3 million tons of rare earth oxide. This same complex
also holds 575 million pounds of uranium concentrates, as well as 2.21
million tons of zinc, which would meet a great deal of global demand for
the next 50 years. [Several Chinese companies are already actively
mining in Greenland.]{.underline} The United States has not made any
comparable investments in the island.

In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the [[Arctic could
hold upwards of 30 percent of the world's undiscovered gas]{.mark}
resources and 13 percent of the world undiscovered oil
resources,]{.underline} with an estimated 84 percent located in offshore
areas. While the survey again brought a greater focus on Alaska's
extensive resources, believed to hold the second largest Arctic energy
reserves in the world, Greenland also drew attention. So far, however,
the **[[envisioned Greenland oil boom has not panned
out]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2013, a British firm abandoned its
exploration efforts off the coast of Greenland after its \$1.4 billion
venture did not yield predicted reserves.

And in a world with a rapidly diminishing Arctic polar ice cap,
increased Arctic shipping --- both across the Arctic and through the
Central Passage or trans-Polar route --- could economically benefit
Greenland. Investment in port infrastructure and related maritime
activity would make Greenland a potential shipping hub for trans-Polar
commerce. China is exploring the possibilities of this trans-polar sea
route as the Chinese shipping firm COSCO annually tests this route. But
[[Greenland's]{.mark} small population (]{.underline}57,000[) and
[limited infrastructure]{.mark} (predominantly along the southwestern
coast) [make it less attractive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Iceland seems to
be a more attractive location for enhanced port infrastructure (which a
German firm is pursuing) for future Chinese exports.

One of the least discussed reasons that China is interested in exploring
economic opportunities in the Arctic is the country's continued access
to the rich and growing fishing stocks in the Arctic. In fact, access to
fishing stocks is so economically vital to Arctic nations that they have
raised tensions and led to the potential for conflict. One example is
the so-called "cod wars\" between Iceland and Britain in the 1970s.

With all the discussion about the economic importance of Greenland, the
ironic part of this tale is that [Arctic mineral and energy
resources,]{.underline} [key shipping infrastructure and fisheries
already exist in the United States]{.underline} today \... [in
Alaska,]{.underline} a strategic purchase the United States made from
the Russian empire in 1867 for a mere \$7.2 million. [Wouldn't it be
better to wisely and sustainably invest in the American
Arctic?]{.underline} The American Arctic urgently needs a deepwater port
to responsibly manage an increase in shipping traffic through the narrow
Bering Strait. Although it is controversial and must be balanced with
strong environmental protection[, [the United States can **enhance** its
mineral and energy extraction from Alaska]{.mark} while working toward
diversifying its resource-based economy[. **Rather than buy Greenland**,
the **US should invest in Alaska** and deepen our economic and security

[[There's been a lot of talk about President-elect Trump's idea of

past two years, there have been 12 air incursions into the state's
air-defense identification zone, including an unprecedented joint
Russian-Chinese strategic bomber operation, and large-scale joint
Russian-Chinese naval task forces in our waters.

[Greenland plays an important part in missile-defense and early-warning

Alaska.]{.underline} Any missiles launched by Russia, China or North
Korea against the U.S. would likely fly over the state. That's why it
hosts the vast majority of America's radar systems and ground-based
missile interceptors. To create an Iron Dome for America---a priority of
Mr. Trump---[we need to add to our national ballistic-missile
interceptor capability in Alaska and build a robust layered missile
defense and space-based missile sensor capability.]{.underline}

[[Greenland is rich]{.mark} in minerals and energy reserves. [Alaska is
even richer.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Our state holds an estimated **[40
billion barrels of oil]{.underline}** and roughly **[235
trillion]{.underline}** cubic feet of natural gas.]{.mark} In one field
alone, Prudhoe Bay, Alaska reinjects into a reservoir for oil-production
purposes as much natural gas each day as Oregon, Washington and
California consume.

[[Alaska also has a **wealth** of metals and other minerals,]{.mark}
some of [which are **essential** for]{.mark} our national [defense,

Biden worked to keep them in the ground. The first Trump administration
approved a road needed to access one of America's richest mineral
deposits, the Ambler Mining District in Alaska's Interior. [The Biden
administration killed that road last June. Then Mr. Biden traveled to
Angola to announce \$600 million to build a railroad to help that
country market its critical minerals.]{.underline}

Buy Greenland? Sure, if the price is right and the Danes are willing to
sell. But as Mr. Trump prepares to unleash Alaska's potential again,
it's worth remembering what the father of the U.S. Air Force, Gen. Billy

### Solvency\-\--2NC

#### US-Canada cooperation solves mineral shortages.

Christopher Hernandez-**Roy 25**, senior fellow and deputy director of
the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS); and Henry **Ziemer**, associate fellow with the Americas
Program CSIS, 6/12/2025, \"Canada May Be the United States' Best Hope
for Minerals Security,\"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/canada-may-be-united-states-best-hope-minerals-security

China's recent export controls, especially of rare earth elements
(REEs), have left Western companies reeling, with some firms
allegedly considering shifting elements of production back to China just
for access to the minerals. Indeed, the need for these minerals is so
urgent that they took center stage in the recent
U.S.-China negotiations in London, held in an effort to ease the trade
war between the two countries. While the preliminary agreement to come
out of these talks offers some respite, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [needs to find reliable sources of REEs, and
Canada could emerge as an **alternative supplier** to complement U.S.
efforts to get domestic REE production back on its feet]{.underline}.
However, this will require both countries to admit they still need each
other, amidst the tension generated by President Donald Trump' tariffs
and talk of annexing Canada.

REEs, and magnets produced from them, are essential to electric and
conventional automobile manufacturing, semiconductors, turbines, medical
devices and the defense industry. These minerals have captured the
public's, and President Trump's, attention in recent months, as a steady
drumbeat of reports announcing the discovery of new and heretofore
underdeveloped deposits of REEs valued in the tens of billions are
released.  

Both Ukraine and **[Greenland]{.underline}**, for instance, are
[allegedly home to massive quantities of the elements, but neither
country has **any current production**]{.underline}. The likely driver
of the U.S. president's musings over annexing Canada is access to the
country's vast natural resources, including critical minerals. Of
course, the bottleneck in the REE market is not due to the size of a
country's reserves, but the economics of separation, processing, and
refining. Despite their importance to the global economy, the profit
margins in the REE industry are punishingly slim, driven down further by
China, which has been able to channel state resources and financing to
its domestic sector to create a virtual monopoly on these minerals. Not
only has China boxed out many competitors, but on April 4, it stopped
exporting REEs, causing alarm across industries. 

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has pursued a
variety of initiatives aimed at revitalizing]{.underline} its formerly
world-renowned [REE industry]{.underline}. Most notable among these
efforts is MP Materials' Mountain Pass mine in California. The company
recently announced it will be developing a refining facility in Fort
Worth, Texas, to help build a vertically integrated supply chain for
rare earth magnets within the United States. But the estimated 1,000
tons of magnets the facility will produce annually once it is up and
running will amount to less than a third of 1 percent of China's 2024
output, well below the levels needed to weaken the country's grasp on
the sector.

The White House has also pursued minerals agreements with countries
including Ukraine to secure long-term supplies. But it will be years, if
not decades, before these agreements bear fruit, while more REEs are
needed *now* across U.S. domestic industry. [Overlooked in much of this
discourse are]{.underline} the [investments]{.underline} that [the
United States' closest neighbor and now-estranged
ally---**Canada**---has been making]{.underline} north of the border. 

The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC), located in Saskatoon, Canada,
was the first commercial-scale REE processing facility to set up shop in
North America. In December of 2024, the SRC successfully produced 40
tons of high-purity neodymium-praseodymium metals. More recently, the
SRC signed a memorandum of understanding with U.S. firm REalloys, which
supplies high-performance rare earth magnets to defense contractors. The
agreement aims to achieve annual production of 500 tons of magnets by
2026, and 1,000 tons by 2028. Like MP Materials, these quantities pale
in comparison to China's behemoth REE industry, but the fact that
production is ongoing rather than theoretical places it as one of the
most promising REE projects in operation. Furthermore, SRC has developed
its own separation and refining process, clearing a major technical
hurdle and introducing the potential for this knowledge to be diffused,
licensed, and scaled. According to representatives from the company, SRC
has been able to remain cost competitive by incorporating greater
automation and artificial intelligence that allows it to achieve higher
efficiency per worker compared to competitors in China.

SRC is not the only operational REE project in Canada. Quebec currently
boasts two commercial-scale facilities, in the form of Rio
Tinto's Sorel-Tracy scandium demonstration plant, and
Geomega's Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville rare earth recycling demonstration
plant. In 2022, Sorel-Tracy reported its first production of high-purity
scandium oxide, used in lightweight aluminum alloys in the aerospace
sector. Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville takes aim at a different part of the
supply chain, recovering precious REEs from magnets found in
technologies like wind turbines and electric vehicles to create a
circular supply chain. Both benefit from the province's long history of
metal refining, and abundant clean energy from hydropower. These two
facilities remain smaller in scale, but once again present building
blocks upon which a more robust U.S.-Canada REE strategy could take
shape. Finally, 12 more REE projects in Canada are estimated to be in
the exploration or initial assessment phases.

[Canada is]{.underline} accordingly [a **prime target** for a U.S.
minerals strategy that aims to **boost domestic mining** and
**refining** while partnering with allies to weaken China's
dominance]{.underline}. For more than 30 years, Canada has been a part
of the U.S. defense industrial base, and during President Trump's first
term, the two countries signed a Joint Action Plan of Critical Minerals
Collaboration. To date, [the United States has invested more than \$70
million in Canadian critical minerals projects under the Defense
Production Act (DPA)]{.underline}. This includes a recent \$15
million commitment by the Trump administration to support Northcliff
Resources' tungsten project in New Brunswick.

But [tensions between the two]{.underline} countries [risk **unraveling
this collaboration** at a time when it is most needed. China has done
the United States a favor by wielding REEs as a **weapon of trade war**,
but the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [risks
squandering that opportunity by alienating partners like Canada who
could serve as alternative suppliers]{.underline}. This applies not just
in the case of rare earths, but steel, aluminum, uranium, and potash,
where Canada is the largest supplier for U.S. industry and agriculture.

Despite these headwinds, there are a number of areas where the United
States and Canada can cooperate to bolster North American minerals
security as a whole.

1.  In addition to supporting existing REE projects like Mountain Pass
    and SRC, [Washington and Ottawa should consider establishing a
    **joint REE extraction and processing facility** to supply both
    nations]{.underline}. While this can and should bring in private
    sector players including the aforementioned firms, [a high-level
    commitment]{.underline} from the two countries that REEs are a
    matter of national security [would be a **powerful
    signal**]{.underline}. Such an agreement [should]{.underline} also
    [allow for technology transfer between the United States and Canada
    to identify new methods for REE extraction and
    processing]{.underline}.

2.  China's export restrictions have had such a pronounced effect
    because much of U.S. industry lacks sufficient stores of REEs to
    maintain production in the face of supply chain disruptions.
    [Building out **national stockpiles** is one way to alleviate this
    pressure, and]{.underline} the [U.S. National Defense Stockpile can
    serve as one such mechanism]{.underline}, though it currently
    remains in dire need of replenishment. Australia has
    also announced plans to develop its own minerals stockpile in
    response to escalating geoeconomic tensions. As outlined in
    a previous CSIS Brief, Canada should consider standing up its own
    stockpile, which could not only help to build strategic autonomy,
    but act as a buyer of last resort for Canadian minerals projects in
    the face of price fluctuations. Additionally, [the United States and
    Canada alike might consider creating incentives like tax credits for
    companies to maintain their **own minerals stockpiles**]{.underline}
    to create additional resiliency across industry.

3.  [While]{.underline} continued [investments under DPA Title III have
    been a promising sign of U.S.-Canada minerals cooperation, more is
    needed in]{.underline} the [race to secure critical
    minerals]{.underline}. Canada, for its part, should consider
    developing its own equivalent to the DPA to target investments in
    defense-critical resource projects. Such a fund would be another
    means for Canada to demonstrate its commitment to North American,
    and north Atlantic defense following Prime Minister Carney's
    commitment to boost defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by the end
    of 2025. Ultimately however, developing patient capital needed to
    support greenfield mining and processing will be necessary for North
    America to tap its full minerals potential. Unfortunately, current
    trade tensions disincentivize these kinds of investments, making a
    swift resolution to the Trump administration's tariffs and the
    Canadian counter-tariffs essential.

[Neither government should have any illusions about]{.underline} the
[difficulty of weakening, let alone supplanting, China's REE
monopoly]{.underline}. Restoring industrial-scale REE production in
North America also poses thorny questions when it comes to environmental
safeguards, community relations, and enabling infrastructure,
particularly energy supply. It will also require significant political
will from both countries. The Trump administration claims Canada has
nothing to offer that the United States cannot get at home, while the
Carney government proclaims the old model of U.S.-Canada cooperation is
over (what comes next remains uncertain). Both [leaders would do well to
recognize]{.underline} that [the United States and Canada
are]{.underline} both far [stronger together than apart. Partnering on
minerals security could be a **necessary first step** to remind both
Washington and Ottawa of this fact, and aligning on a safer, stronger,
and more prosperous North America]{.underline}.

#### Cooperation secures supply chains.

Studies (CSIS), et al., 2/18/2025, \"Mining for Defense: Unlocking the
Potential for U.S.-Canada Collaboration on Critical Minerals,\"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/mining-defense

Policy Recommendations

[Action is]{.underline} sorely [needed across]{.underline} the entire
[defense minerals supply chain]{.underline}. However, for an industry
where timelines are often measured in years, if not decades,
[**effective prioritization** is key. Greater alignment between Canada
and the United States regarding which types of minerals]{.underline} and
segments of the supply chain to focus on [will be
essential]{.underline}, similar to the division of efforts during World
War II.

[1. Establish a Canadian DPA Title III]{.underline}.

The [first step to closer U.S.-Canada alignment should be]{.underline}
establishing [a Canadian financing instrument for defense-critical
minerals akin to DPA Title III]{.underline}. The DPA is a U.S. law that
[empowers]{.underline} the [federal government to mobilize resources
from]{.underline} the [private sector to serve exigent national security
needs]{.underline}. Title III of the act is principally an investment
program, which the U.S. government can employ to catalyze projects that
"create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore" industrial base
activities. Since 1993, Canada has been considered part of the U.S.
industrial base for the purposes of DPA Title III investments. However,
only recently has this partnership begun to see meaningful cross-border
investments take shape.

At present, the [DPA has allocated approximately \$63.4 million to five
critical minerals projects in Canada]{.underline}, with the Canadian
government putting up roughly \$35.9 million in matching funds. [These
are encouraging developments but a far cry from the funding needed if
North America hopes to reorient vital supply chains away from
adversaries]{.underline}. Furthermore, with the Trump administration
focused on bolstering the U.S. domestic minerals supply, the onus will
likely shift to Canada to take the lead on investing in its mining
sector development.

[Standing up such an initiative would present]{.underline} a [strong
signal to]{.underline} the [minerals industry that Canada is ready to
pull its own weight and would give]{.underline} the [Canadian government
a powerful instrument to channel investments]{.underline} in defense
minerals. Such an initiative need not be cost-prohibitive either: a
Canadian DPA Title III would not require paying the whole cost of a new
mine or processing facility but merely require signaling a government
stake in the project and letting private sector investment make up the
rest. The CAD 3.8 billion (approximately \$2.7 billion) allocated over
eight years in the 2022 Canadian federal budget to support
implementation of the Canadian critical minerals strategy is
considerably less than the CAD 6.3 billion (approximately \$4.4 billion)
it cost the Canadian government to suspend some sales taxes over the
winter holidays. It is also less than its plan to send checks for CAD
250 (approximately \$175), totaling CAD 3.8 billion, to 18.7
million individual Canadians who earned less than CAD 150,000
(approximately \$104,000) in 2023. Resources like these could be instead
channeled into helping dozens of critical minerals projects get off the
ground. A Canadian DPA Title III equivalent would also be one step to
begin addressing long-standing U.S. concerns over Canada's failure to
meet its NATO obligations on defense in a manner that would pay
dividends for Canada's economy more broadly.

[2. Include a Critical Minerals Chapter under the USMCA]{.underline}.

The United States--Mexico--Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed in 2018,
includes a provision for a review process to occur by July 2026, during
which each of the three participating countries is supposed to signal
its intention to continue with the agreement or not. While both Canada
and Mexico initially hoped this would be a simple review with not much
change, it has become increasingly clear over the past year that the
United States sees the review, rather, as an opportunity for a more
thorough renegotiation of the agreement. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration [has indicated that it intends to push
for accelerating the timetable for **renegotiation**, likely in
2025]{.underline}, to address points of friction it has with both its
trading partners.

[Renegotiation]{.underline} of the USMCA [offers]{.underline} the
[opportunity to resolve existing problems, expand the agreement, and
begin thinking about it not simply as a trilateral trade agreement but
also as a long-term strategic economic security framework. One area of
expansion could be a new USMCA chapter on **critical minerals**
that addresses financial support from governments to open new mines and
processing facilities]{.underline}, expedites permitting for mineral
projects, coordinates action to stabilize prices, and incentivizes
long-term investment in the sector.

[3. Develop patient capital for mining investment]{.underline}.

While a Canadian equivalent to DPA Title III would serve as a crucial
short-term measure, [locking in North American critical minerals
security requires cultivating an investment environment prepared to
offer]{.underline} sustained [backing as companies navigate the "valley
of death" of launching a new minerals project]{.underline}.
Loan-guarantee programs offer one opportunity to build this kind of
patient capital. One relevant example is the UFK program in Germany,
through which the German government secures a percentage of the overall
financing for a given critical materials project. [These guarantees make
new mineral projects far more palatable to commercial investors, who
feel secure knowing they can recoup most of]{.underline} their
[investment in a worst-case scenario. The U.S. Export-Import Bank and
Export Development Canada can work together to devise realistic loan
guarantees depending on]{.underline} the [criticality of a particular
mineral project]{.underline}, reducing the chances that the bottom falls
out from beneath new mining projects before they can begin production.

[4. Incentivize public and private sector stockpiling]{.underline}.

[Stockpiling is a key mechanism through which]{.underline} the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies [can insulate
themselves from coercive minerals diplomacy]{.underline}. Unfortunately,
the U.S. National Defense Stockpile (NDS) has fallen to historic lows
since the end of the Cold War. According to the Congressional Research
Service, current NDS reserves would supply "less than half of estimated
strategic and critical materials shortfalls for military requirements"
in a best-case crisis scenario. The [NDS]{.underline} urgently [needs
expanded purchasing power]{.underline}, but this is only half the
equation. The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should incentivize companies to maintain their own stockpiles of
critical materials as part of a move to harden supply chains. U.S. and
Canadian governments could consider financial incentives like tax breaks
for minerals purchased but not consumed by companies in a given
year]{.underline}. Consideration should also be given to creating a
Canadian strategic stockpile of defense-critical minerals. Potentially,
such investments could count toward Canada's NATO commitments on defense
spending, though care should be taken to identify which minerals make
the most sense from a strategic and market standpoint when launching
such an initiative.

[5. Increase bilateral cooperation to identify priority
projects]{.underline}.

The [Canada-U.S. Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals]{.underline},
launched under the first Trump administration, [provides a useful
starting point, but it could be strengthened]{.underline} in important
ways. First, [both]{.underline} countries [should
acknowledge]{.underline} the [unique challenges of mineral supply for
defense industrial purposes]{.underline}, in addition to conversations
around energy transition requirements and advanced technology. Second,
[a more thorough undertaking should be launched between the two
countries to map and identify priority geologies and projects on both
sides of]{.underline} the [border to meet]{.underline} their [respective
mineral demands. This]{.underline} cooperation [must go
beyond]{.underline} the [federal level to include Canadian provincial
governments]{.underline}, given their crucial role in permitting and
project development. Ontario Premier Doug Ford's proposal to launch a
new mineral security alliance to work on fast-tracking investments to
national security--relevant projects represents one such step in the
right direction. Given the long timelines associated with mining
projects, time is of the essence to pick investments that will bear
fruit soon enough to mitigate the effects of coercive resource diplomacy
by adversaries. [U.S.-Canada cooperation]{.underline} in this regard
[could provide a model for multilateral engagement with allies on
minerals security policy, allowing]{.underline} the [United States and
its allies to rapidly identify which countries and projects are best
prepared to backstop demand for]{.underline} a [particular mineral or
set of minerals]{.underline}. Starting in North America with two close
neighbors and critical partners is a necessary first step.

[6. Invest in enabling infrastructure for mining]{.underline}.

[Discovering a new deposit of critical minerals means little
without]{.underline} the [infrastructure to develop it, including
lodging, transport connections, and power supply]{.underline}.
Particularly in Canada's northern and Arctic regions, historical
underinvestment has left these areas with a paucity of core
infrastructure. [This not only hinders mining activity but also
jeopardizes Canadian security and sovereignty in the high
north]{.underline}, as acknowledged in Canada's Arctic defense strategy.
[Mining could provide]{.underline} one [solution]{.underline}, as new
projects help lay the groundwork for a stronger northern logistics
network that can support both local economies and military operations,
should the need arise. While the Canadian government has committed
some CAD 218 million (\$152 million) over 20 years to Arctic defense
infrastructure development, channeling support to buy down the costs of
enabling infrastructure at mining sites in the high north could yield
even faster gains. Canada should also strengthen mechanisms for
participation by local, especially Indigenous, communities in the
vicinity of proposed mining projects to ensure these populations can tap
into the benefits of new infrastructure investment.

Pierre **Gratton 25**, President and CEO of the Mining Association of
Canada, 5/28/2025, \"Despite challenges, Canada could become global
mining supplier of choice,\"
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/adv/article-despite-challenges-canada-could-become-global-mining-supplier-of/

How is Canada's mining sector performing in today's global economy?

The global economy is dynamic, but conflict, inflation and political
instability are creating uncertainty. Despite this, mining remains a
steady growth engine for Canada. In 2023, the sector contributed
\$117-billion, or four per cent of Canada's GDP. But challenges remain:
Canada's economy isn't growing fast enough to keep pace with its
population, and productivity lags behind global peers. We must build on
our success to meet rising demand for minerals, especially as national
security and the green economy drive demand for more resources.

What minerals are driving future demand, and what does that mean for
Canada?

[Demand for]{.underline} gold and platinum group metals as well as
[critical minerals]{.underline} including graphite, lithium and cobalt
-- all of which are needed for clean technologies -- [is expected to
surge]{.underline} by mid-century. To capture this growth, [Canada must
discover, permit and build new mines, smelters and refineries. Doing so
will require more investment and faster, more efficient permitting
processes]{.underline}. We have the resources, but scaling up production
to meet global demand warrants a co-ordinated effort between industry
and government to improve infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.

How has the Canadian government responded to the mining sector's needs?

The [federal government has implemented]{.underline} new and enhanced
existing [tax credits that will help mineral exploration and
development]{.underline}. The Liberal platform includes new tax
proposals and infrastructure proposals that are welcome, but need to be
acted upon. [We've]{.underline} also [seen **welcome investment**
from]{.underline} both [Canadian and U.S. governments in critical
infrastructure and mine development]{.underline}. However, project
permitting remains a major frustration, with timelines often far too
long despite government promises.

Permitting delays seem to be a recurring issue. What's the status?

Project permitting is a significant bottleneck. The [federal
government]{.underline} recently [set ambitious targets: five years for
federally designated projects and two years for non-designated ones, and
the new Carney government has now committed to two years for **all
projects**]{.underline}. Meeting these goals will require major changes
in how agencies co-ordinate and engage with Indigenous communities. The
mining industry needs a regulatory regime that's not just timely but
also efficient, reliable and effective. Without this, Canada risks
losing investment and falling behind.

Canada is a global leader in responsibly mined, low-carbon minerals,
metals and energy products. We produce over 60 minerals at nearly 200
mines nationwide, supporting everything from steel for buildings, metals
for batteries for electric vehicles, and oil and uranium for energy.

How important is Canada's trade relationship with the United States for
mining?

It is very important to both countries. The U.S. is Canada's largest
trading partner in minerals and metals, with bilateral trade valued at
\$146-billion in 2023. Tariffs or trade disruptions would hurt supply
chains, increase costs and force Canada to seek alternative markets,
weakening a long-standing partnership.

Can you give us a snapshot of Canada's mining activity today?

[Canada is a **global leader** in]{.underline} responsibly mined,
[low-carbon minerals, metals and energy products]{.underline}. We
produce over 60 minerals at nearly 200 mines nationwide, supporting
everything from steel for buildings, metals for batteries for electric
vehicles, and oil and uranium for energy. In 2023, mining generated
\$71.9-billion in mineral production alone. We're a top producer
globally of potash, niobium, uranium, diamonds, gold and palladium.
Canada's mining sector is also known for very high environmental and
labour standards.

What workforce challenges does the mining sector face?

In 2023, mining employed 430,000 people directly and supported many more
indirectly, including over 12,000 Indigenous workers. We will need over
100,000 new workers in the next decade. While we've made progress
recruiting Indigenous employees, we must do more to attract women, young
people and visible minorities. Increasing graduates in mining-related
fields will also be key.

What's your outlook for the future?

[**I'm optimistic**. The fundamentals are **strong**, and global demand
for responsibly sourced minerals will **only increase**]{.underline}. If
we can improve regulatory efficiency, invest wisely and foster
partnerships -- especially with Indigenous communities -- Canada can
become the supplier of choice for critical minerals powering the clean
economy.

Mining: Rocky Industry Challenges and Opportunities,\"

Struggle to Attract Foreign Investment Due to Regulatory Barriers

[Canadian **federal laws**]{.underline} continue to [discourage
investments in Canadian mining companies as **scrutiny of such
investments** has intensified under]{.underline} the [Investment Canada
Act (the "ICA")'s national security review regime, leading]{.underline}
to [**foreign investments** being blocked]{.underline} or abandoned due
to extended review periods and potentially deterring future investment
in Canadian projects.

The ICA is a federal law enabling the Canadian government to review
foreign investments into Canada. While the ICA was historically focused
on ensuring foreign-directed investments into significant Canadian
businesses were of "net benefit to Canada", [the ICA's national security
review regime]{.underline}, created in 2009, has become the prominent
feature of the ICA. The ICA's national security regime [permits the
Government to **block** or **impose conditions** on foreign investments
into Canada]{.underline}. From 2021 to 2024 there were four mining
related [transactions involving **Chinese-controlled entities** subject
to orders blocking investment or requiring divestment of prior
acquisitions]{.underline} under the ICA\[8\] and three
[mining]{.underline} related [transactions involving Chinese-controlled
entities where full-scale national security reviews were
ordered]{.underline} and the investors withdrew their investments in
response.\[9\] Additionally, during those four years, seven investments
were withdrawn following the investor receiving a notice the Canadian
Government was considering issuing a full-scale national review order.
It is unclear how many of those transactions were of Chinese origin and
related to mining. There are likely many other investments that might
not have been made at all out of the fear of such reviews.

[Recent amendments]{.underline} to the ICA further expanded government
oversight, [introducing mandatory pre-closing filings and waiting
periods for investments in specific sectors]{.underline}. While these
amendments are not yet in effect as the precise industries that will be
covered by this obligation have not yet been established, it is
anticipated investments in critical minerals will be caught by this new
obligation. National security reviews are becoming increasingly lengthy,
often exceeding the ICA's 200-day statutory timeline, which permits
additional extensions "on consent", which investors may be willing to
give where the alternative is their investment getting blocked.

In May 2024, Solaris Resources backed out of a \$130 million agreement
to sell a 15% stake to TSX listed Zijin Mining Group, a partially
government-owned Chinese mining company. While Solaris is a
Canadian-incorporated company, its primary assets consist of mining
projects located in Ecuador, Mexico, and Chile.\[10\] Solaris intended
to use funds from the sale to advance its Warintza copper-gold project
in Ecuador. In its announcement about the withdrawal, Solaris cited this
decision as being due to its "inability to complete the transaction in a
reasonable timeframe" and "ongoing regulatory concerns." In November
2024, Solaris announced its intention to redomicile away from Canada and
relocate to Switzerland.\[11\] Canadian mining companies redomiciling
outside of Canada to avoid a perceived burdensome regulatory regime is
an increasingly problematic trend.

The Canadian federal government's increasing reluctance to allow
Canadian companies to accept Chinese investment as illustrated by the
Solaris Resources example limit funding options of Canadian mining
companies, even where no operating assets are in Canada. For more
details on the ICA and foreign investments in mining, please see our
bulletin Canadian Miners Asking: Will Canada Remain a Competitive
Jurisdiction for Mining Companies with Global Assets? As raising capital
for Canadian mining companies continues to be a domestic challenge,
international partners willing to partner in Canadian projects need to
be permitted and encouraged to fill this void.

There are examples of Canada taking steps to attract foreign investment,
but we need to see more proactive and sustained effort in this area. For
example, in 2023, Ontario and the state of Nevada signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (the "MOU") to strengthen collaboration in mining, marking
a significant step enhancing cross-border economic ties. This initiative
is a strategic response to the growing global demand for critical
minerals, essential for advanced manufacturing, electric vehicles, and
clean energy technologies. Over \$2 billion (CAD) in trade moved between
Ontario and Nevada in 2022\[12\] and the MOU aims to increase that in
coming years. By pooling resources and expertise, both regions can boost
development of supply chains, accelerate innovation, and secure a stable
supply of these crucial materials. Similarly, targeted efforts to forge
alliances with other key jurisdictions could attract foreign capital by
showcasing Ontario's (and other Canadian Provinces and Territories) role
as a stable, resource-rich region with access to well-developed
infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and favorable trade agreements.

### AT: China Reliance\-\--1NC

#### The status quo is [moving away]{.underline} from rare earths now. Development outside of China accelerated, manufactures adapted, and new reduced military reliance all prove.

The narrative was compelling: An authoritarian power was wielding its
mineral wealth as a geopolitical weapon, putting a resource-hungry West
at its mercy. Yet few people remember this supposed strategic calamity
today.

[**Market** mechanisms **undermined** China's **attempt at** resource
**leverage**]{.underline}. In the early 2010s, [supply **growth outside
China accelerated**.]{.underline} **[Projects]{.underline}** already
**[in development]{.underline}** by Molycorp [in California
and]{.underline} Lynas in [Australia ramped up, **adding** tens of
thousands of metric tons of **production capacity**.]{.underline} By
2014 China's market share of rare earths had fallen from more than 90%
to about 70%.

[China's export quotas also proved surprisingly porous]{.underline}.
**[Producers exploited loopholes]{.underline}** by [shipping minimally
processed alloys exempt from restrictions]{.underline}, while an
estimated 15% to [30% of production was smuggled through neighboring
countries]{.underline}. Beijing's inability to police thousands of small
miners [fatally **undercut** its **embargo**]{.underline}.

[**Manufacturers** displayed remarkable **adaptability**.]{.underline}
**[Refineries]{.underline}** temporarily **[substituted]{.underline}**
alternative [catalysts,]{.underline} and magnet producers
[optimized]{.underline} alloys [to **use less rare-earth** material,
some even **switching** entirely to new **technologies**]{.underline}.
This "demand destruction" blunted the crisis' effect even before new
supplies could fully come online. Prices that had spiked in 2011 quickly
retreated to pre-crisis levels.

The 2010 episode revealed fundamental constraints on attempts to use raw
materials as geopolitical weapons. While [China retains significant
market share, the **U.S. defense** industry has **reduced** its
**reliance** on rare earths **to a minimum**]{.underline} (the
equivalent of less than 0.1% of global demand), and [weapons **programs
maintain inventories** to **buffer** temporary supply
**disruptions**.]{.underline}

Despite their name, [**rare earths** are quite **abundant**. Cerium is
the 25th most common element on Earth. At 68 parts per million of
Earth's crust by weight, it is more abundant than copper. Rare earths
are "rare" because of geochemical dispersion.]{.underline} They tend to
remain evenly mixed rather than found in their pure form. They also pose
extraction challenges, since they are usually bound up in a handful of
mineral hosts that often contain radioactive thorium or uranium. That is
what makes rare-earth deposits relatively scarce.

The **[[Defense Department]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [in **recent
months** [advanced]{.mark} its [goal of **developing domestic supply**
chains to]{.mark} ensure [**continued access** to]{.mark} the
**[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth
[m]{.mark}aterial[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} needed to manufacture the
permanent magnets used in important U.S. military weapons systems.  

\"[**DOD**\'s recently **published National Defense Industrial
Strategy** will guide the creation of a **modernized defense industrial
ecosystem**]{.underline},\" said **[Laura Taylor-Kale]{.underline}**,
assistant secretary of defense for industrial base policy. [Taylor-Kale
has a doctorate in management science and engineering with a
specialization in organizations, technology and entrepreneurship from
Stanford University\'s School of Engineering]{.underline}.

\"**[Resilient supply chains are essential]{.underline}** to this goal.
The [U.S. can **no longer afford** to rely on overseas]{.underline},
single-points-of-failure for critical components,\" Taylor-Kale added.  

Rare earth permanent magnets are not only essential components in a
range of defense capabilities, including the F-35 Lightning II aircraft,
Virginia and Columbia class submarines and unmanned aerial vehicles, but
also a critical part of commercial applications in the United States.
They are also used to generate electricity for electronic systems in
aircraft and focus microwave energy in radar systems.  

Since 2020, [**[DOD]{.mark}** has **[awarded]{.mark}** more than
[**\$439 million** to]{.mark} establish **[domestic r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lement [supply chains]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
This includes separating and refining rare earth elements mined in the
U.S., as well as developing downstream stateside processes needed to
convert those refined materials into metals and then magnets.  

\"[**DOD\'s [strategic investments]{.mark}** are [building
**capability** at **multiple stages** of]{.mark} the **[rare earth
supply chain]{.mark}**]{.underline} and will provide a clear signal to
private capital that the time is right to build additional resiliency,\"
said Danielle Miller, acting deputy assistant secretary of defense for
industrial base resilience. \"[We are [**on track** to meet]{.mark} our
[**goal** of]{.mark} a sustainable, [mine-to-magnet supply chain capable
of supporting **all U.S. defense requirements** by
**2027**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"  

In addition to the F-35, Virginia and Columbia class submarines, magnets
produced from rare earth elements are used in systems such as Tomahawk
missiles, a variety of radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles,
and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs. The F-35,
for instance, requires more than 900 pounds of rare earth elements. Each
Arleigh Burke DDG-51 destroyer requires 5,200 pounds, and a Virginia
class submarine needs 9,200 pounds.  

Rare earth elements are also used in other ways that don\'t involve
magnets. Vehicle-mounted laser range finders, such as those found on
Abrams M1A1/2 tanks, make use of rare earth elements, as do their
portable counterparts and target designators. Also making use of rare
earth elements are; fiber optics communication systems; cerium-polished
optical lenses; and sonic transducers used in submarine sonar systems.  

There are 17 elements on the periodic table referred to as \"rare
earth\" elements. While DOD needs nearly all of them in some capacity,
three are used to make the permanent magnets critical to so many defense
systems.  

Continued U.S. reliance on foreign sources for rare earth products poses
a risk to national security. The U.S. and most of the world depends on
China for many rare earth elements. 

Through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial
Base Policy, the [**[M]{.mark}anufacturing [C]{.mark}apability
[E]{.mark}xpansion and [I]{.mark}nvestment [P]{.mark}rogram
[directorate]{.mark}** [has embarked on]{.mark} a **five-year [rare
earth]{.mark}** [investment strategy to build \"**mine-to-magnet**\"
domestic capacity]{.mark} at all **critical nodes** of the **rare earth
supply chain**]{.underline}. Those critical nodes include [sourcing,
separation, processing, metallization, alloying and magnet
manufacturing]{.underline}.  

The first of those critical nodes, the sourcing of rare earth elements,
means mining rare earth elements out of the ground. Today in the U.S.,
there is only one rare earth mine currently active and selling to the
commercial market.  

Separation includes a series of processes that take out extractable rare
earth elements from other elements and compounds in the mineral rock.
Processing involves concentrating separated rare earth elements and then
chemically treating them to produce high-purity rare earth oxides or
rare earth salts. The metallization step transforms rare earth salts
into rare earth metals. Depending on the application, those metals can
be combined with various alloying elements to produce a variety of rare
earth alloys.  

Finally, rare earth magnets are typically produced from alloys that are
sintered, or bonded, into magnet block and then cut and coated according
to specification.  

It\'s important that all those critical nodes happen inside the U.S. so
the Defense Department can have a secure supply of the rare earth
materials and rare earth magnets it needs.  

Projects underway have already helped the U.S. establish growing
capacity in rare earth element separation and processing, as well as
magnet manufacturing.  

Among the U.S.-based companies involved in DOD\'s \"mine-to-magnets\"
initiative is [MP Materials]{.underline}, which is headquartered in
Nevada. With [\$45 million]{.underline} in support from MCEIP awards, MP
Materials established the only integrated rare earth mine and oxide
production facility in the U.S. The company is expected to continue to
add capacity for additional oxide products through 2025, when they are
projected to reach full-scale production.  

Right now, domestic and partner demand for rare earth materials outpaces
the production of any single partner nation. To build resiliency in
these critical, early stages of the supply chain, [Lynas USA,
LLC]{.underline} was awarded a combined [\$288 million]{.underline} in
MCEIP funding to establish a second domestic, commercial-scale oxide
production capability by 2026.  

MCEIP has also invested [\$10 million]{.underline} to explore the
development of extraction technology and alternative sources of rare
earth minerals from coal ash, acid mine drainage and other waste
streams.  

[Noveon Magnetics]{.underline} has established a rare earth magnet
manufacturing facility in San Marcos, Texas, with a [\$28.8
million]{.underline} award from MCEIP. The company produces qualified
magnets from extracted or recycled material for both defense and
commercial applications.  

An additional award of [\$2.3 million]{.underline} from MCEIP has also
helped [TDA Magnetics]{.underline} to demonstrate a capability to
source, produce and sell qualified magnets into DOD supply chains.  

Finally, with a [\$94.1 million award, E-VAC Magnetics]{.underline} will
establish a commercial-scale rare earth magnet manufacturing capability
by 2025. As part of this project, E-VAC will also develop domestic
capacity to produce rare earth metals and alloys, a critical node of the
supply chain linking early-stage rare earth processing to magnet
production.  

These [[**awards** from the D]{.mark}efense [D]{.mark}epartment are
expected to **[help develop]{.mark}** the domestic
**market**]{.underline} for magnet production to [serve]{.underline}
both [**[defense]{.mark}** and commercial
**[market]{.mark}s**]{.underline}.  

[[Future]{.mark} **MCEIP [investments]{.mark}** are expected to [focus
on **closing remaining**]{.mark} supply chain
**[gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline} and promoting integration among the
tiers. [[DOD expects]{.mark} its [support]{.mark} of these emerging
capabilities [will attract additional investment]{.mark} in rare earths
from both defense and commercial manufacturers]{.underline}. With these
additional investments, the [**[Department]{.mark}** will be [**able**
to **meet**]{.mark} its **[future demand]{.mark}** for magnets
**[without overseas dependencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[New rules]{.underline}]{.mark} requiring firms [[in
**China**]{.underline}]{.mark} to get a license before exporting some
rare earth elements [[are **bolstering** plans to **establish rare
earth**]{.mark} **processing** [in **other countries**]{.mark}. The
[**US** and **E**]{.mark}**uropean [U]{.mark}nion** are [**eager** to
support]{.mark} these projects]{.underline}, but new producers still
face a difficult path forward.

Rare earth elements are used to manufacture powerful magnets for
electric motors, wind turbines, missiles, and many other products. A
number of mines around the world, including one in California, yield
ores that contain a mixture of rare earth elements. But nearly all the
rare earths in those ores are processed in China at facilities that
separate them and convert them into metals.

China announced the licensing rules for seven elements---mainly heavy
rare earths like dysprosium and terbium that are crucial for
high-performance magnets---shortly after the US imposed high tariffs on
Chinese products.

David Merriman, who covers rare earth elements for the minerals research
firm Project Blue, says the licensing requirements are causing rare
earths to pile up at China's ports. He expects the backlog to clear as
companies get their paperwork in order, but the regulatory changes are
also a warning that China can clamp down more tightly in the future.

For example, China limited the amount of gallium and germanium that
companies could export in 2023 and then escalated this limit to an
outright ban on exports to the US the following year after the US
prohibited the sale of advanced chip-manufacturing equipment to China.
Similarly, in 2010, China significantly restricted exports of rare
earths, sending prices skyward.

Aware of the economic and military importance of rare earths,
[**[policymakers]{.mark}** in the US and Europe have been **[encouraging
domestic production]{.mark}**]{.underline}. President Donald J.
[[**Trump** signed an **executive order**]{.mark} in March [aimed at
**speeding up**]{.mark} permitting for **US [mining
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also in March, the [**[E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion** [identified **dozens** of]{.mark} **mineral
[projects]{.mark}** [it plans to support]{.mark}, including rare
earth--[processing facilities in France, Poland, and
Sweden]{.mark}]{.underline}.

And after China implemented the rare earth license rules, Trump ordered
an assessment of the national security risks posed by the US's reliance
on imported minerals, including rare earth elements.

[[**Government enthusiasm** combined with]{.mark} **rapidly growing
[demand]{.mark}**]{.underline} for magnets is [likely to [drive an
**increase** in]{.mark} both [**public and private investment** into
rare earth processing outside China]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to
Tim Rose, director of the mineral intelligence firm Rovjok. But he warns
that scaling up those facilities will take a long time.

#### Chinese [dominance]{.underline} over the [REMs]{.underline} industry is [declining]{.underline}.

While China maintains a commanding presence within the global rare earth
industry, [[**Beijing's capacity** to **unilaterally disrupt** supply
chains]{.underline}]{.mark} is likely to be [**[eroded]{.mark}** in the
coming years]{.underline}. A [[**number** of **initiatives**]{.mark} are
**underway**]{.underline} that may [[prove **successful** at
establishing **new**]{.mark} **rare earth [suppliers]{.mark}** [outside
of China. **Shifting market dynamics**]{.mark}]{.underline} are likely
to [[aid]{.mark} these efforts]{.underline}.

There are [**[already signs]{.mark}** that [other
players]{.mark}]{.underline} have started to [[**chip away at** China's
**dominance**]{.mark} in certain areas. **[Mining]{.mark}** of raw rare
earth materials outside of China has **[ramped up
significantly]{.mark}**]{.underline} in recent years as the [**US'
Mountain Pass** mine, and **other [mines]{.mark}** [around the
world]{.mark}, have **[increased]{.mark} their [output]{.mark}**[.
**China's** share of]{.mark} global **mining [production]{.mark}** has
**[slipped]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a result, [[from]{.mark} a high of
**[97.7]{.mark} percent in 2010** [to **62.9**]{.mark} **percent in
2019**]{.underline} -- the lowest point since 1995. [**China's** share
of global **[rare earth]{.mark} reserves** has]{.underline} likewise
[[fallen from **50 percent** to **36.7 percent**]{.underline}]{.mark}
over the same period.

China's status as the preeminent supplier of oxides, metals, and
permanent magnets has not been similarly diminished -- but it may be in
the coming years. In the US, the company MP Materials is working to
bring online facilities at Mountain Pass that would allow it to process
its mined minerals, instead of sending them to China for processing. The
company aims to accomplish this in 2021 and to establish the ability to
refine and separate rare earth metals in the coming years.

[[**International efforts** are also underway]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
April 2020, the US DoD green-lit initial funding for a [[**joint
venture** between Australia]{.mark}'s **Lynas Corporation** [and
US]{.mark}-based **Blue Line Corporation**]{.underline} to construct a
processing facility in Texas. If successful, it would allow Lynas to
ship rare earth materials from its processing facility in Malaysia to
the US for final processing -- rather than to China. The **[[Japanese
government]{.underline}]{.mark}** (through JOGMEC) is [[looking to
invest]{.mark} in US and Australian initiatives]{.underline}, likely
including the new facility in Texas. These steps are part of Tokyo's
announced goal of further reducing Japan's reliance on Chinese rare
earth imports to less than 50 percent by 2025.

[[Due to growing demand]{.mark} for rare earths, these
**[ventures]{.mark}** will **[likely]{.mark}** be more
**[successful]{.mark}** than previous attempts to establish rare earth
suppliers outside of China]{.underline}. Much of this new demand is
being driven by rapid growth of the renewable energy and electric
vehicle industries, which utilize large quantities of rare earth
permanent magnets. From 2007 to 2017, China's production of renewable
and nuclear energy more than tripled, accounting for roughly 51 percent
of the global increase in production over this period. China's electric
vehicle market is growing even faster. Between 2014 and 2019, the number
of electric vehicles in China swelled from approximately 90,000 to
nearly 3.4 million.

[[As China's domestic consumption]{.mark} of rare earths [grows, the
**country** will be **increasingly reliant on
imports**]{.mark}]{.underline} to feed its appetite for the materials.
[China already became the world's largest importer of rare earths in
2018]{.underline}, and it is expected to become a net importer by the
middle of the decade. Under these conditions, [[**Beijing's influence**
over the global rare earth industry]{.mark} would be **[significantly
reduced]{.mark}**, and **[new players]{.mark}** might finally [find
themselves able to compete]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Rare earths" are 17 chemical elements with awkward names and unusual
properties. Their atomic numbers are 57--71, 21, and 39. Their two
subfamilies, one scarcer and hence more valuable than the other, have
similar chemistries, so they're generally found and mined together.

[Despite their name, rare earths are **not geologically rare** but are
widely dispersed throughout the Earth's crust]{.underline}. They are
mined in few places and by few firms, though, because they tend not to
occur in highly concentrated form. Further raising miners' costs and
risks, [the world market for rare earths is modest]{.underline} (several
billion dollars a year), [volatile, complex, and dominated by
China,]{.underline} where not all mines and exports are legal and
transparent. One expert concluded that about half of 2015 global
production was off the books.

[Rare earths' uses are highly specialized but diverse]{.underline}.
These elements are used in mobile phones, superstrong magnets and hence
advanced motors and generators, some oil-refinery catalysts, certain
lasers and fluorescent-lamp or flat-screen phosphors, some batteries and
superconductors, and other technologies important to modern life. [Some
rare earths are particularly useful in energy applications.]{.underline}
Around 2010, some [articles and commentators **warned** that shortages
of rare earths, or **China's** near-**monopoly** on them, could **choke
off the West's** shift to renewable energy and other clean technologies.
This **was never true**---but the myth persists.]{.underline}

Bubble and burst. Rare earths concerned only specialists until about
2009--10. In the mid-1990s, [China had consolidated its control over
most of the global rare-earth market,]{.underline} and the [last US mine
and mill,]{.underline} once the world's dominant producer, [closed in
2002 because it was unprofitable.]{.underline} [China began imposing
export quotas in 2006, and limited exports to Japan]{.underline} (a
major user of rare earths for high-tech miniature motors) during a
diplomatic spat in 2009--10, so [global prices and anxieties
soared]{.underline}. US government agencies published urgent reports
about the rare-earth crisis and its threat to national security. Could
China's control of these crucial elements---roughly 97 percent at the
time---block Washington's ability to produce Tomahawk missiles, F-35
jets, and night-vision goggles, as some military writers warned, never
mind electric vehicles and wind-power turbines?

As a technologist who had advised major mining companies, written two
books on metal mining and a 445-page text on efficient motor systems,
done rare-earth physics experiments at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and
consulted for MIT's Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, [I knew enough to
be **unconvinced by rare-earth alarm bells**. It all felt like a
commodity bubble, based more on a shortage of understanding---of rare
earths, economic geology, and resource efficiency and
substitution---than on a shortage of rare earths.]{.underline}

Sure enough, the [debate was heavy on the supply of rare earths but
light and often misinformed on the demand side]{.underline}. The [few
observers]{.underline} who [focused more on demand suspected that rare
earths' price spike wouldn't last long, whether or not it reflected
mining-stock hype]{.underline}. I called the coming crash, to general
ridicule, in 2010. [Rare-earth prices soared through spring]{.underline}
2011[---when a rare-earth bonanza was fondly predicted]{.underline} for
Helmand Province in Afghanistan---[but then plummeted.]{.underline}

[US supplier]{.underline} Molycorp reopened its California rare-earth
mine in 2012, but [went broke]{.underline} in 2015 [when low world
prices wouldn't support its high costs]{.underline}. By 2015, MIT
Technology Review asked, "What Happened to the Rare-Earths Crisis?" [It
**misleadingly** called rare earths "**crucial** to the permanent
magnets used in wind turbines and motors in hybrid or electric cars,"
and concluded that **worries** about them had "seemingly **dissipated**
without much fanfare" as "demand fell more than expected]{.underline},"
but never connected the dots by asking why demand did that. By 2016--17,
the market was in the doldrums, with China planning to limit annual
production to 140,000 metric tons beginning in 2020 to try to raise
prices again. An investor in the rare-earth industry in 2007 would have
lost 81 percent of her portfolio value after a classic decade-long
boom-and-bust wild ride (see the chart at the top of this article from
buyupside.com).

This is not how a durably scarce and valuable commodity behaves. What
happened? Just what you'd expect of a thin market influenced by
ignorance but ultimately tamed by reality. When prices soared,
stockpiles rose, idle mines reopened, explorers sought and found new
deposits, and recycling increased (for example, cerium in glass
polishing). Most important, as customers from General Electric to Toyota
to Ford sought to cut costs and boost performance, the costlier
materials were used more frugally and often replaced with cheaper,
better solutions---all as I'd predicted in 2010. Prices fell
accordingly.

Efficiency and substitution. To dig a little deeper, let's start with
supermagnets. Neodymium is a rare-earth element roughly as abundant in
the Earth's crust as lead or chromium, though far less likely to
concentrate in high-grade ores. In 1982, General Motors and Sumitomo
discovered that compounding one-fourth neodymium by weight with
three-fourths iron and boron could make the most powerful family of
supermagnets then known, typically Nd2Fe14B, and that these magnets'
properties could be further improved by adding traces of other rare
earths---praseodymium plus either dysprosium or costlier terbium. (See
why only specialists know this stuff?) [China, having lots of all these
elements and preferring value-added to raw-material exports, built up a
supermagnet industry whose low prices took over most of the world market
and shuttered competitors. China also vigorously pursued research and
development to find further uses for its rare-earth bounty. Even in
2015, China accounted for more than **80 percent** of global rare-earth
production but also for about **70 percent** of rare-earth
demand---**not** an **unreasonable** balance.]{.underline}

**[[China]{.mark}'s Rare Earths Aren't as Rare as You
Think]{.underline}**

When the [country [**tried** to **choke off supply**]{.mark} of the
metals **[before]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the **[[world]{.mark} found
ways to [adapt]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

China responded to President Trump's tariff hikes with a series of
retaliatory measures. On April 4, among other moves, Beijing suspended
the export of some of the 17 rare-earth metals and magnets that are
vital to American defense, energy and automotive industries.

The commentary that ensued revealed profound anxieties about alleged
Western vulnerabilities. The New York Post accused the Chinese of
"kneecapping US industry." The BBC declared that the communist nation
had dealt "a major blow to the US," while the [Economist warned that
China's control of rare earths was a "weapon that could hurt
America."]{.underline}

These commentators have a point. According to the International Energy
Agency, China produces about 61% of rare-earth minerals, and it
processes 92%. The [**anguished reaction** from]{.underline} the
[American press]{.underline}, however, [revealed]{.underline} a measure
of [obliviousness. The **reality is that America has been here
before**]{.underline}.

[[Fifteen years ago]{.underline}]{.mark}, following a **[dispute with
Tokyo]{.underline}** over contested waters, [[China imposed]{.mark} a
rare-earth [embargo]{.mark}]{.underline} on Japan, while
[[cutting]{.mark} its [rare-earth export]{.mark} quotas [to the rest of
the world by 40%]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beijing's [actions rang alarm
bells]{.underline} across the industrialized world. Prices of the
rare-earth metals spiked, with cerium soaring from \$4.15 a kilogram in
January 2010 to \$150.55 in July 2011. American defense analysts warned
that Beijing was exploiting a strategic vulnerability. U.S.
manufacturers scrambled for alternatives to the minerals, which play a
crucial role in everything from wind turbines to precision-guided
missiles.

The panic seemed justified. At the time China controlled 93% of global
rare-earth production and more than 99% of the most valuable heavy rare
earths. Congress convened a hearing on China's rare earths monopoly,
with Rep. Don Manzullo (R., Ill.) saying that Beijing's action
"threatens tens of thousands of American jobs."

The narrative was compelling: An authoritarian power was wielding its
mineral wealth as a geopolitical weapon, putting a resource-hungry West
at its mercy. Yet [**few people** remember this **supposed** strategic
calamity today]{.underline}.

[[Market mechanisms undermined]{.mark} China's attempt at [resource
leverage]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the early 2010s, **[[supply growth
outside China accelerated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Projects already in
development by [Molycorp in **[California]{.mark}** and Lynas in
[**Australia** ramped up]{.mark}]{.underline}, adding tens of thousands
of metric tons of production capacity. By [2014 [China's market
share]{.mark} of rare earths had [fallen]{.mark} from more than 90%
[to]{.mark} about [70%]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[China's [export quotas]{.mark}]{.underline}** also proved
[[**surprisingly porous**. Producers **exploited loopholes** by shipping
minimally processed alloys]{.mark} exempt from
restrictions]{.underline}, while an estimated [15% to [30% of production
was **smuggled**]{.mark} through neighboring countries. [Beijing's
**inability**]{.mark} to **police** thousands of small miners **[fatally
undercut]{.mark}** its [embargo]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Manufacturers displayed]{.mark} **remarkable [adaptability]{.mark}**[.
Refineries]{.mark}]{.underline} temporarily [**[substituted
alternative]{.mark}** catalyst[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [magnet
producers optimized alloys]{.underline} to use less rare-earth material,
some even switching entirely to new technologies. This [["demand
destruction" blunted]{.mark} the [crisis]{.mark}' effect even before new
supplies could fully come online. Prices]{.underline} that had spiked in
2011 [quickly retreated]{.underline} to pre-crisis levels.

The [[2010 episode revealed]{.mark} **fundamental [constraints]{.mark}**
[on **attempts** to use]{.mark} **raw [materials]{.mark}** [as]{.mark}
geopolitical [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. While China retains
significant market share, the [[U.S. defense industry]{.mark} has
**[reduced]{.mark}** its **[reliance]{.mark}** on rare earths to a
minimum]{.underline} (the [equivalent of [less than 0.1%]{.mark} of
global demand]{.underline}), and [weapons [programs maintain
**inventories**]{.mark} to buffer]{.underline} temporary [supply
disruptions]{.underline}.

Despite their name, [**[rare earths]{.mark} are quite
[abundant]{.mark}**[. Cerium]{.mark}]{.underline} is the 25th most
common element on Earth. At 68 parts per million of Earth's crust by
weight, it [is [**more abundant** than **copper**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Rare earths are "rare" because of geochemical dispersion. They tend to
remain evenly mixed rather than found in their pure form. They also pose
extraction challenges, since they are usually bound up in a handful of
mineral hosts that often contain radioactive thorium or uranium. That is
what makes rare-earth deposits relatively scarce.

#### No impact. Companies will just [adapt]{.underline}.

In a high-escalation scenario, [[Chinese policymakers may decide
to]{.mark} impose]{.underline} as high costs as possible on the
[**[sanction]{.mark}**ing [G7 countries by imposing export restrictions
on]{.mark} all [goods where import dependence]{.mark} on China [is
high]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such an [approach would cover a broad range
of consumer and industrial goods]{.underline}, and would be aimed at
disrupting the economies of the targeted countries and increasing costs
for consumers. [[**However**, this would come at **tremendous cost** to
the **Chinese economy**]{.underline}]{.mark} and its ability to
withstand sanctions.

Import dependence is contingent on a range of factors, including not
only how much a country depends on another for a particular good, but
also how widely available that good is in the global market. While a
true accounting of import dependence requires a sector-by-sector
approach, we roughly estimate the value of goods where the G7 nations
are highly dependent on China by summing up G7 imports at the HS 6-digit
level where (1) over 50 percent of G7 imports come from China, and (2)
China accounts for over 50 percent of global exports. This encompasses
all products where both initial dependence on China is high and where
substitutes from other countries may be expensive or hard to find given
how dominant China is in that product category, at least in the short
run. Based on this approach, the G7 is highly dependent on \$477.5
billion in goods imported from China. This is a highly conservative
measure, since losing access to intermediate goods would disrupt
downstream manufacturing and incur costs much greater than their import
value alone.

\<\<\<TABLE 9 AND 10 OMITTED\>\>\>

While [[**export** **restrictions** would be]{.mark} one of China's
**most impactful economic statecraft tools**]{.underline}, it would also
[be [among the **options** **costliest** to China
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, an [estimated **[101.2 million
jobs]{.mark}** in China [**depend on** foreign final demand]{.mark},
44.8 million of which depend on final demand from G7
countries]{.underline}.65 Any measures that disrupted these factories
would [[exacerbate **structural issues** in **employment**]{.mark} and
wages]{.underline}. Secondly, [a [**major source** of China's resilience
against sanctions is the fact that it runs a]{.mark} persistent [trade
surplus]{.mark}]{.underline}, which could be [[put **at risk** from
export restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even under a full-scale G7
sanctions regime against Chinese banks, it would be very difficult to
trigger a balance of payments crisis in China so long as the country
continues to run a strong trade surplus. [**[Trade
restrictions]{.mark}** from China]{.underline} that undermine its own
trade surplus [would [**work against** China's ultimate **objective** of
maintaining **macroeconomic stability**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a moment
of crisis. Finally, sanction regimes face the challenge of preventing
transshipment of goods from third countries into the targeted economy.
To effectively cut off the United States and other G7 economies from
these products would require China's non-sanctioned trading partners to
agree not to transship controlled products to the G7, and for China to
be willing to impose punishments on third countries that refuse to
comply. China is unlikely to have the bureaucratic breadth even to
monitor potential sanctions evasion on this scale, and may be loath to
punish other countries in a moment where it is diplomatically isolated.

#### No impact.

America's trade war with China has been quietly escalating for years,
but this week it took a turn for the disastrous. Huawei, once the rising
star of China's tech industry, has been cut off from US suppliers,
leaving the company effectively stunted. China is likely to respond
somehow, but with a multitude of options on the table, many in the tech
industry are now considering nightmare scenarios.

One particularly [chaotic option would be a ban on the export of rare
earths]{.underline} --- raw materials that are crucial for electronics.
These elements are produced mostly in China, and used in the US for
everything from electric cars to wind turbines, smartphones to missiles.

[Chinese state media have backed the idea]{.underline}, calling
America's dependence on Chinese rare earths "an ace in Beijing's hand."
President Xi Jinping hinted at that possibility when he visited a rare
earth facility at the beginning of this week. (As a ministry
spokesperson commented with what seemed like a nod and a wink: "It is
normal that the top leader investigates relevant industrial policies. I
hope everyone can interpret it correctly.")

Rare earth elements are sometimes described as the "vitamins of
chemistry," as small doses produce powerful salutary effects. A sprinkle
of cerium here and a pinch of neodymium there makes TV screens brighter,
batteries last longer, and magnets stronger. If China suddenly shut off
access to these materials, it would be like rewinding the tech industry
back a few decades. And no one wants to ditch their iPhone and go back
to a BlackBerry.

[**[Experts in the field]{.mark}**, though, are [much **less concerned**
about]{.mark} such a **chilling [scenario]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They
say that while a [[restriction]{.mark} on rare earth exports would [have
some immediate]{.mark} adverse [effects]{.mark}, the [US]{.mark} and the
rest of the world [would **adapt in the long run**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
"If China really cuts off supply entirely then there are short term
problems," Tim Worstall, a former rare earth trader and commodities
blogger tells *The Verge*. "But **[[they're
solvable]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

Far from being an ace in the hole, it turns out [[rare earths]{.mark}
are more of a **[busted flush]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [[reasons for this are numerous]{.mark}, and span geography,
chemistry, and history]{.underline}. But the **[[most important
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}** is also the simplest to explain: **[[rare
earths just aren't that rare]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[A group of **[17 elements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, rare earths are what
the USGS (United States Geological Survey) **[[describe as "moderately
abundant]{.mark}."]{.underline}** That means they're not as common as
oxygen, silicon, and iron, which make up the vast majority of the
Earth's crust, but some are [[on a par with elements like copper and
lead]{.mark}, which we don't consider exotic or scarce. [Significant
deposits exist in]{.mark}]{.underline} China, but also **[[Brazil,
Canada, Australia, India, and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**.

The challenge with producing rare earths (and the reason they were given
their name) is that they're rarely found in concentrated lumps. These
are chemically sociable elements, happy to bond with other compounds and
minerals and tumble about in the dirt. This makes extracting rare earths
from common earth like convincing a drunk friend to leave a raucous
party: a lengthy and harrowing procedure.

As Eugene Gholz, a rare earth expert and associate professor of
political science at the University of Notre Dame puts it: "Once you
take it out of the ground, the big challenge is chemistry not mining;
converting the rare earths from rock to separated elements."

Unlike convincing that drunk friend, though, this process involves a
series of acid baths and unhealthy doses of radiation. This is one of
the reasons that countries like the US have been more or less happy to
cede production of rare earths to China. It's a messy, dangerous
business, so why not let someone else do it? Other factors also helped,
including lower labor costs and the existence of Chinese mines that
produce rare earths as a byproduct.

China's sway in the rare earths market is a fairly recent state of
affairs. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the majority of the world's
supply was actually produced in America, from the Mountain Pass mine in
California. The mine's processing plant was shut down in 1998 after
problems disposing of toxic waste water, and the whole site was
mothballed in 2002.

It's only from the 1990s onward that China has shouldered the bulk of
production, along with the associated environmental costs. (In 2010, the
Chinese government estimated that the industry was producing 22.05
million tons of toxic waste each year.) An oft-referenced figure is that
China now produces some 95 percent of the world's rare earths, but Gholz
says this statistic is "wildly out of date." The USGS pegs China's part
as closer to 80 percent.

That's still a substantial chunk of the world's supply, though, and with
[no doubt that these are important commodities]{.underline}, the
question is: **[what happens if China does cut off the
US]{.underline}**?

Luckily, [[we have]{.mark} a **[very good idea]{.mark}** of **what would
happen** next [because it's **already happened before**]{.mark}. Back in
2010, China **stopped exports** of **rare earths**]{.underline} to Japan
following a diplomatic incident involving a fishing trawler and the
disputed Senkaku Islands. Gholz wrote a report of the fallout from this
incident in 2014, and found that despite China's intentions, **[[its
ban]{.mark} actually [had little effect]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Chinese **smugglers** continued to export]{.mark} rare earths off the
books; **[manufacturers]{.mark}** in Japan [found ways to **use
less**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the materials; and [[production in other
parts]{.mark} of the world [**ramped up** to
compensate]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The world is flexible," says Gholz.
"When you try to restrict supplies to politically influence another
country, people don't give up, they adapt."

He says that although his report examined the rare earth industry as it
was in 2010, the "[[conclusions are]{.mark} **pretty much [the
same]{.mark}**[" in 2019]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[If China did turn off the rare earth tap]{.underline}, there would [be
[**enough** private and public **stockpiles** to **supply essential
sectors**]{.mark} like the military in the short term]{.underline}. And
while an embargo could lead to price rises for high-tech goods and
dependent materials like oil (rare earths are essential in many refining
processes), Gholz says it's highly unlikely that you would be unable to
buy your next smartphone because of a few missing micrograms of yttrium.
"I don't think that's ever going to happen. It [just **[doesn't seem
plausible]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he says.

[Even though a ban on rare earth exports is just speculation at this
point, **[companies have begun to preempt]{.mark}** any new Chinese
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. American chemical firm **[Blue Line
Corp]{.underline}** and Australian rare earth miner
**[Lynas]{.underline}** have [[already proposed new production
facilities]{.mark} in the US]{.underline}, and [[rare earth stocks
around the world have surged]{.mark} in response]{.underline} to the
threat.

In the event of a ban, [one of the most important backstops would be
**[America's Mountain Pass mine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although the
mine was closed after Chinese rare earths drove down prices, the
[facility [is **intact** and resumed production]{.mark} last
January]{.underline}. Recent estimates suggest [it's [already supplying
one-tenth of the world]{.mark}'s rare earth ores]{.underline} (though
not their processing), and in the event of an embargo, it would be
[[possible to bring Mountain Pass back up to speed]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"By far the cheapest and fastest way to bring more material into the
market --- if there was a disruption --- is just sitting there in
California," says Gholz. "It's not like starting from scratch."

Worstall agrees: "Producing rare earth concentrate is near trivially
simple," he says. "I, or any other competent person, could produce that
from a standing start within six months in any volume required."

The kicker, both say, is how much that process might cost. Especially as
any refining and separation plants built in the US would have to meet
far higher environmental standards.

As we're seeing with Huawei and other casualties of Trump's trade war,
the real question isn't whether adaptation is possible in the future,
it's how much pain you can stomach in the present.

### AT: Taiwan Invasion\-\--1NC

#### China will not invade Taiwan -- it doesn't have the tech nor the economy

Zoe **Desch, 25** Zoe Desch is the Executive Assistant to the CEO of the
Quincy Institute and a Notre Dame graduate. She has also worked at the
National Defense Industrial Association, Emerging Technologies
Institute, and National Defense University. - \"Three reasons why China
can\'t afford to invade Taiwan\" 6-11-2025
https://responsiblestatecraft.org/china-taiwan-2672344549/ - lily

Taiwan has become a focal point for the U.S.-China conflict, with the
Pentagon turning its attention towards a hypothetical conflict with
China --- referring to it as the "sole pacing threat" --- and China
continuing combat and blockade drills around the island.

However, [despite China's demonstrations of military power, Taiwan's
unique economic niche and geographic position make it a particularly
thorny target for Beijing. The Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy
rests largely on the robust economy it has built, and the direct
economic repercussions of an invasion or blockade of Taiwan stand to
shatter the foundations of Beijing's domestic power]{.underline}.

There are [three non-military conditions that make a full military
assault]{.underline} or blockade [of Taiwan a nonviable option for the
CCP]{.underline}. First is [the global importance of Taiwan's
semiconductor manufacturing base,]{.underline} second is [the impact on
trade and the shipping industry running through the Taiwan Strait and
Luzon Strait, and]{.underline} third [is China's own less-than-favorable
economic conditions.]{.underline}

The semiconductor issue

Taiwan is the largest manufacturer of semiconductors in the world. In
the fourth quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
(TSMC) ---[Taiwan's largest producer of semiconductors --- took a 67.1%
market share of all chips globally, and produced nearly all of the most
advanced chips. There is no viable replacement for Taiwan's
manufacturing in the semiconductor market;]{.underline} not only does
the nation represent a massive share of the chip industry, its
infrastructure uniquely supports the scale and quality of production.

[Semiconductors represent an irreplaceable enabler of global economic
activities. If Taiwan were to stop producing chips, both the American
and Chinese economies --- not to mention the world economy --- would
contract and ignite a global depression]{.underline}. Chips enable
electrical grids, manufacturing, home utilities, automobiles, and more;
they have permeated every facet of the global economy.

Semiconductors are not an end in themselves, they are a means to an end,
enabling innovation and emerging technologies like AI and robotics.
Taiwan's dominance in this critical market is referred to as its
"silicon shield," which means that the U.S. and China are invested in
protecting its output.

[An offensive or blockade against the island nation would have a
profound global economic impact. The most important global economies
rely on the chips manufactured in Taiwan. With demand for chips only
growing, losing Taiwan\'s manufacturing base could throttle global
supply chains for years to come.]{.underline}

Inefficacy of military action

Chinese military action would disrupt the global commerce running
through the Taiwan and Luzon Straits. The straits on either side of
Taiwan are thoroughfares for international trade, with Taiwan's own
ports handling \$586 billion in trade in 2022, and an estimated \$2.45
trillion transiting the strait in the same time period. Besides Taiwan,
China's ports are most likely to be impacted, with ships diverting from
the ports along China's eastern coast.

While global shipping lanes can likely divert around a conflict zone
without significantly raising prices, China's role in maritime shipping
infrastructure means that conflict would have a direct negative impact
on some of China's most lucrative ports and port cities, with ships no
longer making stops along a broad swath of the coast.

Ships will not be able to access the extensive network of maintenance
and repair sites along the Chinese coast, as well as cargo processing
sites. The loss of access to some of these ports would have knock-on
effects for the global shipping industry if there is a protracted
conflict or blockade, leaving remaining ports to deal with the
spillover.

Geopolitically, China would have to reckon with the Global South and
BRICS nations, whose trade relies on the straits even more than the G7.
Given that China is courting these nations diplomatically, impeding
their trade could set off a diplomatic fiasco that Beijing would likely
want to avoid.

Already poor economic conditions

[China is not in a strong economic position as it has been reined in by
the lingering aftereffects of its real estate crisis, subdued domestic
consumption, and the impacts and uncertainty created by the trade war's
tariffs. Kicking off a global crisis would likely exacerbate the
economic issues it currently faces.]{.underline} Furthermore, Taiwan
represents up to 60% of China's own chip imports. [If China attacks
Taiwan it stands to cripple its own industries by starving them of
chips]{.underline}. Besides chips imports, the PRC is heavily dependent
on trade --- comprising 37% of its GDP --- making it even more
vulnerable to disruptions in global trade.

According to a study done by Bloomberg Economics, [in the event of a
blockade, global GDP would be down 5%, with China and the U.S. seeing
shrinkage of 8.9% and 3.3%, respectively.]{.underline} And in the event
of an invasion, global GDP would be down 10.2%, with South Korea, Japan,
and other East Asian nations seeing the worst of the impact. The
resulting \$10 trillion price tag on merely the first year of the crisis
incentivizes the stakeholders to avoid confrontation. [If any or all of
Taiwan's foundries are destroyed, the impact would be even greater and
the economic depression would last for a decade or more as nations
attempt to build out their own profitable foundries. Not to mention that
this would likely create a permanent rift between China and trade with
the U.S. and the EU.]{.underline}

While both China and the U.S. attempt to relieve their respective
reliance on Taiwanese chips through domestic production, Taiwan retains
its most advanced nodes on its territory in order to maintain global
dependence on its chips industry. Cajoling from both the U.S. and China
has brought TSMC investment and factories to both nations, but these
nodes do not represent a viable replacement for Taiwan's output.

#### China only threatens Taiwan invasion to bolster nationalism but has no plans of an actual invasion

The ongoing tension between the United States and China has been a focal
point in international relations, with Taiwan often at the center of
these discussions. However, despite the frequent portrayal by the U.S.
that a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan is imminent, the reality
within China suggests a more nuanced strategy. [China's leadership is
acutely aware that an invasion of Taiwan would not only risk demolishing
the country's economic machinery but could also destabilize the Chinese
Communist Party of China (CCP) in ways never before seen.]{.underline}

[The CCP's legitimacy has long been tied to the economic prosperity of
the nation. This prosperity has been the bedrock of stability in China,
allowing the government to maintain control without the need for
widespread repression.]{.underline} However, [in times of economic
fluctuation, nationalism becomes an important tool to maintain internal
legitimacy]{.underline}. Taiwan, therefore, becomes a recurring, highly
symbolic issue, evoked to rally nationalistic sentiments among the
Chinese populace.

[There are three primary ways an undemocratic government can impose
itself on its people: economic prosperity, nationalism, and repression.
China is fully aware that an invasion of Taiwan would likely force it to
lean more heavily on nationalism as a mechanism of social legitimacy.
However, such a move would simultaneously disrupt the very economic
stability that underpins the CCP's rule.]{.underline}

Nationalism, while powerful, has its limits. Overreliance on nationalism
without the balancing effect of economic stability inevitably leads to
repression. Once a government crosses into the realm of repression, it
is difficult, if not impossible, to return to a state where nationalism
alone can sustain its legitimacy. This shift could signify the beginning
of the end for the CCP's control.

Despite the potential catastrophic consequences of a military invasion
of Taiwan, [the United States continues to treat such a scenario as
imminent. This perspective, however, plays directly into China's hands.
By treating an invasion as a near certainty, the U.S. inadvertently
fuels Chinese nationalism, which the CCP can leverage to maintain its
internal legitimacy during times of economic volatility.]{.underline}

The recent meetings between U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
and CCP foreign policy chief Wang Yi highlight the careful balancing act
both nations are attempting. The U.S. continues to assert its strategic
competition with China, particularly regarding Taiwan and the South
China Sea, further inflaming nationalist sentiments within China.

Yet, China's true intentions may be more strategic than the U.S.
perceives. [China benefits from the U.S. perception of an imminent
threat of invasion. This perception allows China to bolster its naval
capabilities -- both as a preparation for any potential future conflict
and as a means to keep its industrial and military complex robust. This
dual approach serves to keep the U.S. on edge while providing China with
a bargaining chip in international negotiations.]{.underline}

lily

Serious questions have also been asked about China's officer corps and
their ability to 'judge situations, understand higher authorities'
intentions, make operational decisions, deploy troops, and deal with
unexpected situations'. [Corruption also remains an endemic issue, with
China's military experiencing a new wave of corruption-related scandals
over the past two years that has led to the removal of two defence
ministers and a high-ranking member of China's Central Military
Commission.]{.underline}

Domestic factors will also influence any decision to use military force.
[China is facing adverse demographic trends, including an aging
population and low birth rates. There are other internal struggles, such
as a trend of rising violence, following a string of indiscriminate mass
attacks throughout 2024.]{.underline}

China is also seeking to manage a faltering economy, worsened by
ballooning local government debt, a loss of investor confidence and the
gradual collapse of its real estate sector. Beijing has struggled to
stimulate domestic consumption, relying on its growing share of global
exports to drive the economy. [Researchers at Rhodium Group estimated
that China's GDP was only 2.4 to 2.8 percent higher in 2024 than a year
earlier, well below official claim of 5.0 percent growth.]{.underline}

[China's trade surplus reached a new high of nearly US\$1trillion in
2024. Beijing will be wary of the impact of a potential trade war with
the United States.]{.underline} It will want to strengthen its trade
relationships with other partners to reinforce its economy. [China has
already sought to recalibrate ties with Japan, India and Australia,
while doubling down on its engagement with the Global South. Within this
context, China will want to perform a careful balancing act over Taiwan.
It will not want to damage international relationships by taking
unnecessarily aggressive military actions.]{.underline}

Amid the problems, the leadership nonetheless probably has growing
confidence that, if called upon, the military will be able to 'resolve
the Taiwan issue'. However, Xi probably hasn't yet decided to use force
against Taiwan.

2027 almost certainly remains a short-term goal for military
modernisation, not a date for a Taiwan invasion. Concerns over the
economy and social stability will remain as key priorities for China's
leadership.

[Xi will also want to carefully assess the Trump administration's
resolve on the Taiwan issue. Trump has hinted at a more transactional
approach to Taiwan, suggesting it contribute more to its own security
while still supporting Taipei's right to self-defence. Trump is already
threatening tariffs on Taiwan's semiconductors.]{.underline}

In 2025, [China's military will continue to undertake exercises around
Taiwan as part of a broader coercion campaign against Taipei. However,
the likelihood of large-scale use of force against Taiwan in 2025
remains low.]{.underline}

At the same time, China continues its pressure campaign against Taiwan
while increasing military preparedness for a cross-strait invasion.
Whether China's pressure campaign or a future military attack succeeds,
the aim is the same: to destroy the sovereignty of a free and democratic
Taiwan and subordinate it to communist China.

China is recognized as the premier threat to US national security
interests, and [the United States is committed to Taiwan's
defense.]{.underline} As such, [US, allied, and partnered readiness for
this contingency must be adequately resourced.]{.underline} This is
essential to deterrence and, should deterrence fail, to fighting and
winning.

[Therein lies an apparent dilemma. Doesn't the constant push of US
military support to Ukraine drain the United States of critical
resources needed to defend Taiwan? This supposed conflict led some
commentators to speculate that supporting Ukraine undermines
preparedness for a Taiwan fight]{.underline}.

Their case is simple, arguing [that supporting Ukraine drains the finite
US resources that should be husbanded and prioritized for deterring and
fighting China. Every missile, tank, and artillery shell sent to Ukraine
is one less round that could be fired in a China
contingency.]{.underline} If preparing for a future war with China is
the priority, they argue, the United States should deprioritize what
they argue is a proxy war it is fighting against Russia.

2 Lastly, [the perception of the United States' efforts being spread too
thin also makes Beijing question US ability to aid Taiwan]{.underline}
in case of an invasion. Currently, [with the United States' continued
support of Ukraine in the struggle against Russia]{.underline}, the
United States has provided Ukraine with USD \$175 billion in weapons,
training, humanitarian aid, and budget support. [Two years have passed,
and that war is still dragging on. With the addition of the Israel-Hamas
conflict, Washington is engaged in seeking an end to two
conflicts---which signals to Beijing that Washington is unable to
quickly end a conflict]{.underline}. [The CCP's perception of a
weakening US military,]{.underline} when paired with the policy of
strategic ambiguity that the United States is trying to maintain[, has
resulted in a security environment where the United States can no longer
deliver a credible threat to deter China as it has in the previous three
Taiwan Strait Crises.]{.underline}

The main point: [China is no longer deterred by the denial strategy the
United States is implementing. CCP leaders have found a way to operate
in the gray zone, becoming better prepared while the United States
continues to downplay the looming threat.]{.underline} Washington needs
to pursue a strategy in which the United States can punish the CCP every
time it tries to inch closer to the redline of attacking Taiwan.

The Risk of Miscalculation

But [the risk arises from one side taking action that the other
misreads, concluding for example that a red line has been
crossed.]{.underline} While isolated accidents and miscalculations
are often managed successfully without escalating into all-out
war, actual red lines are concealed from adversaries. [A series of
miscalculations that combine unknown redlines with inaccurate
assessments of motive and capability could lead to
catastrophe,]{.underline} especially if the United States and China
misread one another's broader geopolitical strategies.

The current contradictions on both sides exacerbate this, if not
understood accurately and managed carefully.

Regardless of the PLA scandal, Beijing will continue to pursue a
coercive strategy toward Taiwan. The current military maneuvers in
response to Lai Ching-te's trip are some of the most extensive yet seen.
Indeed, Beijing may be keen to demonstrate its capabilities and resolve
more visibly to compensate for the PLA's command structure disruption. 

U.S. policymakers should be wary of assuming that this disruption would
necessarily lead to reduced resolve when it comes to Beijing's red lines
on Taiwan, or that it would reduce the PLA's operational effectiveness
in the event of conflict. While the latter is a possibility, the PLA
would remain materially a peer of the United States in the East China
Sea, making any conflict a serious challenge. 

The risk of underestimating China's resolve is that a hawkish U.S.
administration could feel emboldened to increase support for Taiwan to a
degree that China deems too escalatory, and thus feels compelled to
respond to with a demonstration of PLA capability. This in turn would
require a response if U.S. deterrence is to remain credible; each step
raises the stakes both of backing down and of potential miscalculation. 

[From the Chinese side, a key risk stems from misjudging Trump's resolve
to follow through on deterrence. Beijing may perceive his lack of
appetite for foreign wars as indicating that the United States would not
support Taiwan in the event of Chinese action. China may be either
emboldened to seize an opportunity to attack or, more likely, to
increase the extent, intensity, and frequency of coercive measures such
as military drills against Taiwan -- including by calling Washington's
bluff in response to any increased material support. ]{.underline}

[This could put the U.S. in an extremely difficult position, because the
more routine and extensive China's actions, the more escalatory a
meaningful U.S. response would need to be.]{.underline} It would also
make it harder to determine when Chinese action is likely to pass a
point beyond which deterrence will be ineffective.

On an issue of fundamentally clashing interests such as Taiwan,
communication between both sides will never be straightforward. For
China, the status quo is inherently undesirable, but for the U.S.,
maintaining it as far as possible is likely the best strategy for
holding off any Chinese action. To do so effectively, the Trump
administration will need to make clear a willingness to follow through
on deterrence, and balance this with a realistic assessment of Beijing's
resolve and the risks of miscalculation on both sides.

swept to victory in **[Vietnam]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In Lyndon

[Fast-forward to]{.underline} our era and consider recent signals sent

those baby-boomer-era airplanes.]{.underline}

5\. Airpower is enormously expensive. Spending on aircraft, helicopters,
and their munitions accounted for roughly half the cost of the Vietnam
War. Similarly, in the present moment, making operational and then
maintaining Lockheed Martin's boondoggle of a jet fighter, the F-35, is
expected to cost at least \$1.45 trillion over its lifetime. The new
B-21 stealth bomber will cost more than \$100 billion simply to buy.
Naval air wings on aircraft carriers cost billions each year to maintain
and operate. These days, when the sky's the limit for the Pentagon
budget, such costs may be (barely) tolerable. When the money finally
begins to run out, however, the military will likely suffer a serious
hangover from its wildly extravagant spending on airpower.

6\. [Aerial surveillance]{.underline} (as with drones), while useful,
[can also be misleading. **Command** of the **high ground**]{.underline}
is not synonymous with godlike total situational awareness. It
[can]{.underline} instead [prove to be a kind of

simply can't negotiate a truce or take prisoners or foster other options
when you're high above a potential battlefield and your main recourse is
blowing up people and things]{.underline}.

7\. **[Airpower is inherently offensive]{.underline}**. [That means it's
more consistent with **imperial power projection** than with national
defense]{.underline}. As such, [it **fuels imperial
ventures**]{.underline} [while fostering the kind of global-reach,
global-power thinking that has in these years had Air Force generals in

AMERICA'S EXPERIENCE WITH AIR POWER

Since World War II, even when the US military has enjoyed total mastery
of the skies, the end result has repeatedly been stalemate or defeat.
Despite this, US leaders continue to send in the warplanes. To
understand why, a little look at the history of air power is in order.

In the aftermath of World War I, with its grim trench warfare and
horrific killing fields, early aviators like Giulio Douhet of Italy,
Hugh Trenchard of Britain, and Billy Mitchell of the United States
imagined air power as the missing instrument of decision. It was, they
believed, the way that endless ground war and the meat grinder of the
trenches that went with it could be avoided in the future. Unfortunately
for those they inspired, in World War II the skies simply joined the
land and the seas as yet another realm of grim attrition, death, and
destruction.

Here's a quick primer on the American experience with air power:

In World War II, the US Army Air Forces joined Britain's Royal Air Force
in a "combined bomber offensive" against Nazi Germany. A bitter battle
of attrition with Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe, ensued. Allied
aircrews suffered crippling losses until air superiority was finally
achieved early in 1944 during what would be dubbed the "Big Week." A
year later, the Allies had achieved air supremacy and were laying waste
to Germany's cities (as they would to Japan's), although even then they
faced formidable systems of ground fire as well as elite Luftwaffe
pilots in the world's first jet fighters. At war's end, Allied losses in
aircrews had been staggering, but few doubted that those crews had
contributed immeasurably to the defeat of the Nazis (as well as the
Japanese).

Thanks to air power's successes in World War II (though they were
sometimes exaggerated), in 1947 the Air Force gained its independence
from the Army and became a service in its own right. By then, the enemy
was communism, and air power advocates like General Curtis LeMay were
calling for the creation of a strategic air command (SAC) made up of
long-range bombers armed with city-busting thermonuclear weapons. The
strategy of that moment, nuclear "deterrence" via the threat of "massive
retaliation," later morphed into "mutually assured destruction," better
known by its telling acronym, MAD. SAC never dropped a nuclear bomb in
anger, though its planes did drop a few by accident. (Fortunately for
humanity, none exploded.) Naturally, when the United States "won" the
Cold War, the Air Force took much of the credit for having contained the
Soviet bear behind a thermonuclear-charged fence.

Frustration first arrived full-blown in the Korean War (1950--53).
Primitive, rugged terrain and an enemy that went deep underground
blunted the effectiveness of bombing. Flak and fighters (Soviet MiGs)
inflicted significant losses on Allied aircrews, while US air power
devastated North Korea, dropping 635,000 tons of bombs, the equivalent
in explosive yield of 40 Hiroshima bombs, as well as 32,557 tons of
napalm, leveling its cities and hitting its dams. Yet widespread bombing
and near total air superiority did nothing to resolve the stalemate on
the ground that led to an unsatisfying truce and a Korea that remains
bitterly divided to this day.

The next round of frustration came in the country's major conflicts in
Southeast Asia in the 1960s and early 1970s. American air power bombed,
strafed, and sprayed with defoliants virtually everything that moved
(and much that didn't) in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. A staggering
seven million tons of bombs, the equivalent in explosive yield to more
than 450 Hiroshimas, were dropped in the name of defeating communism. An
area equivalent in size to Massachusetts was poisoned with defoliants
meant to strip cover from the dense vegetation and jungle of South
Vietnam, poison that to this day brings death and disfigurement to
Vietnamese. The North Vietnamese, with modest ground-fire defenses,
limited surface-to-air missiles, and a few fighter jets, were hopelessly
outclassed in the air. Nonetheless, just as in Korea, widespread
American bombing and air superiority, while generating plenty of death
and destruction, didn't translate into victory.

Fast-forward 20 years to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm in
1990--91, and then to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In both cases, US
and coalition air forces had not just air superiority but air supremacy
as each time the Iraqi air force fled or was otherwise almost instantly
neutralized, along with the bulk of that country's air defenses. Yet for
all the hype that followed about "precision bombing" and "shock and
awe," [no matter how air power was applied, [events on the ground
proved]{.mark} **stubbornly [resistant]{.mark}** to American designs.
[Saddam]{.mark}]{.underline} Hussein [[survived]{.mark} Desert
Storm]{.underline} to bedevil US leaders for another dozen years. After
the 2003 invasion with its infamous "mission accomplished" moment, Iraq
degenerated into insurgency and civil war, aggravated by the loss of
critical infrastructure like electrical generating plants, which US air
power had destroyed in the opening stages of the invasion. [Air
supremacy over [Iraq led]{.mark} not to long-lasting victory but
[to]{.mark} an **ignominious US [withdrawal]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
2011.

Now, [consider the **["war on terror,"]{.mark}**]{.underline}
preemptively announced by George W. Bush in 2001 and still going strong
15 years later. Whether the target's been Al Qaeda, the Taliban,
al-Shabbab, Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula, or more recently the
Islamic State, from the beginning [US air power enjoyed almost
**historically unprecedented** mastery]{.underline} of the skies. [Yet
despite this "asymmetric" advantage]{.underline}, despite all the
bombing, missile strikes, and drone strikes, [["progress"
proved]{.underline}]{.mark} both "fragile" and [[endlessly
"reversible"]{.underline}]{.mark} (to use words General David Petraeus
applied to his "surges" in Iraq and Afghanistan). In fact, 12,000 or so
strikes after Washington's air war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq began
in August 2014, we now know that intelligence estimates of its success
had to be deliberately exaggerated by the military to support a
conclusion that bombing and missile strikes were effective ways to do in
the Islamic State.

So here we are, in 2016, 25 years after Desert Storm and nearly a decade
after the Petraeus "surge" in Iraq that purportedly produced that
missing mission accomplished moment for Washington---and US air assets
are again in action in Iraqi and now Syrian skies. They are, for
instance, flying ground support missions for Iraqi forces as they
attempt to retake Fallujah, a city in al-Anbar Province that had already
been "liberated" in 2004 at a high cost to US ground troops and an even
higher one to Iraqi civilians. Thoroughly devastated back then, Fallujah
has again found itself on the receiving end of American air power.

If and when Iraqi forces do retake the city, they may inherit little
more than bodies and rubble, as they did in taking the city of Ramadi
last December. About Ramadi, Patrick Cockburn noted last month that
"more than 70% of its buildings are in ruins and the great majority of
its 400,000 people are still displaced" (another way of saying, "It
became necessary to destroy the town to save it"). American drones,
meanwhile, continue to soar over foreign skies, assassinating various
terrorist "kingpins" to little permanent effect.

TELL ME HOW THIS ENDS

Here's the "hot wash": [something's gone terribly wrong with
Washington's soaring dreams of air power and what it can
accomplish]{.underline}. And yet the urge to lose the planes only grows
stronger among America's political class.

Given the frustratingly indecisive results of US air campaigns in these
years, one might wonder why a self-professed smart guy like Ted Cruz,
when still a presidential candidate, would have called for "carpet"
bombing our way to victory over ISIS, and yet in these years he has been
more the norm than the exception in his infatuation with air power.
Everyone from Donald Trump to Barack Obama has looked to the air for the
master key to victory. In 2014, even Petraeus, home from the wars,
declared himself "all in" on more bombing as critical to victory
(whatever that word might now mean) in Iraq. Only recently he also
called for the loosing of American air power (yet again) in
Afghanistan---not long after which President Obama did just that.

Even as air power keeps the US military in the game, even as it shows
results (terror leaders killed, weapons destroyed, oil shipments
interdicted, and so on), even as it thrills politicians in Washington,
that [magical [victory]{.mark} over the latest terror outfits [remains
**elusive**]{.mark}. That is, in part, [because air power]{.mark} by
definition **[never occupies]{.mark} ground**. It [can't **dig
in**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It can't swim like Mao Zedong's proverbial
fish in the sea of "the people." [It can't **sustain** persuasive force.
Its [force is]{.mark} always [**staccato** and
**episodic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Its suasion, such as it is, comes from killing at a distance. But [its
[bombs]{.mark} and missiles]{.underline}, no matter how "smart," [[often
**miss**]{.mark} their intended targets]{.underline}. Intelligence and
technology regularly prove themselves imperfect or worse, which means
that the [[deaths of innocents are inevitable. This ensures **new
recruits**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the very organizations the planes
are intent on defeating and new cycles of revenge and violence amid the
increasing vistas of rubble below. Even when the bombs are on target, as
happens often enough, and a terrorist leader or "lieutenant" is
eliminated, what then? You kill a dozen more? As Petraeus said in a
different context: Tell me how this ends.

For years, commentators have been handwringing about the extraction
practices, environmental and social harms, and corporate ownership of
mining operations that contribute to clean energy technology, with a
focus on cobalt, rare earths, and other rare ingredients of the clean
energy transition.

Much like governmental, intergovernmental, and private assessments of
"critical materials," these [[critiques pay]{.underline}]{.mark} far too
[[**little attention** to]{.underline}]{.mark} how scarcity, usually
signaled by price, elicits not only mineral exploration and mine
development but also a powerful set of [[other]{.underline}]{.mark} and
**[[faster]{.underline}]{.mark}** adaptations and [[alternatives like
**efficient use, substitution, and recycling**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

A major contribution to this genre comes from a New York Times
investigative series around cobalt in in the Democratic Republic of
Congo. The Times's informative reportage sheds important light on the
geopolitical as much as the human-rights ramifications of clean energy.

But the Times series, like nearly all prior "critical materials"
coverage, rests on a flawed premise: that cobalt is one of the
"essential raw materials needed for the production of electric car
batteries---and is now critical to retiring the combustion engine and
weaning the world off climate-changing fossil fuels."

The Reality

That cobalt is an essential raw material needed to produce electric car
batteries is true for one class of car-battery chemistries, but others
use little cobalt or none at all. Standard-range Tesla cars' batteries
use no cobalt. Battery leaders Samsung and Panasonic are designing out
cobalt. The portfolio of these alternatives continues to improve and
expand.

Accessible alternatives to "critical materials" can make excellent EV
batteries, solar cells, and wind turbines.

Several years ago, I wrote about "rare earths" (17 unusual chemical
elements that are not geologically rare) in The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists and why they are not a substantial cause for concern in the
transition to clean energy. For the past decade, commentators have
warned (and stock speculators hyped) that China's near-monopoly on
supermagnet rare-earth elements could make the growing global shift to
electric cars and wind turbines impossible---because their motors and
generators, respectively, supposedly required supermagnets and hence
rare earths. But that's nonsense.

In the four years since that Bulletin article, one of the [[key
substitutions]{.underline}]{.mark} it mentions---[[iron-nitride
supermagnets using no]{.mark} [rare earths]{.mark}]{.underline} but
[[with **comparable** or **potentially greater**
performance]{.underline}]{.mark}---entered the market. But even without
that magnet innovation, everything that permanent-magnet motors and
generators do can also be done as well or better using two other
innovations that **[[require no rare earth
minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[**control software** and **power
electronics**]{.underline}]{.mark} made of silicon, the most abundant
solid element on Earth.

Both kinds of magnet-free machines [[can do everything
required]{.underline}]{.mark} not only in electric cars but also in wind
turbines---functions often claimed to be impossible without tons of
neodymium. That some wind turbines use rare-earth permanent-magnet
generators does not mean others must. It's better not to, and the word
is spreading. Tesla's car business was built on magnet-free induction
motors. Its latest autos use the second magnet-free kind, synchronous
reluctance motors, albeit spiced with small magnets. But most
commentators on "blood minerals" are not experts on motors, solar cells,
electricity, electronics, or even mining. They should talk to more
people who are.

Substituting materials

[One strategy to reduce the demand for rare earth elements is for
manufacturers and product designers to engineer products that **use
less** or **no rare earth elements**, or to replace rare earth elements
with **new or different** materials]{.underline}. For example, BMW and
Renault have made some of their [**EVs** without **rare earth**
elements. While this may make batteries less powerful, cars that are
mainly driven in cities may not need as long a battery
life]{.underline}. Recently Tesla announced that its [**next
generation** of electric motors would **use no rare earth**
elements.]{.underline} Moreover, since 2017, the company has reduced its
use of heavy rare earths in its Model 3s by 25 percent.

[Scientists]{.underline} at Northeastern University are [developing a
**substitute material** for rare earth magnets called
tetrataenite.]{.underline} Tetrataenite is only found in meteorites, but
[researchers are trying to recreate a process that took nature millions
of years by rearranging the atomic structure of the material's nickel
and iron components]{.underline} in the lab.

The [scientists have a **\$2.1 million** grant from the **Department of
Energy**]{.underline} to understand how magnetic materials made of
"non-critical elements"are created in nature.

[Researchers]{.underline} at the Critical Materials Institute of Ames
Laboratory are also [studying **magnet substitutes**.]{.underline} They
have [developed ways of predicting which materials have the potential to
be made into magnets.]{.underline} They identify those with some
attraction to a magnetic field, then add alloys to turn the materials
into permanent magnets. The [scientists found that this process could
make forms of cerium cobalt]{.underline} (cerium is an abundant rare
earth element) [capable of substituting for neodymium and dysprosium
used in the **strongest** rare earth magnets]{.underline}.

Around 2010, [many commentators stridently warned that China's
near-monopoly on supermagnet rare-earth elements could make the growing
global shift to electric cars and wind turbines
**impossible**---]{.underline}because their motors and generators,
respectively, supposedly required supermagnets and hence rare earths.
[Some such reports persist]{.underline} even in 2017. **[But they're
nonsense]{.underline}**. [Everything that such permanent-magnet rotating
machines do can also **be done** as well **or better** by two other
kinds of motors that have **no magnets** but instead apply modern
control software and power electronics made of **silicon**, the most
**abundant** solid element on Earth.]{.underline}

[The first kind is the induction motor]{.underline}, invented by Nikola
Tesla 130 years ago and [used in every Tesla electric car
today]{.underline}. The [second kind]{.underline}, less well-known
despite origins [tracing back to 1842]{.underline}, is the switched
reluctance (SR) machine, likewise made of just iron and (less) copper,
but using a different geometry and operating principle. If
well-designed, which many are not, [**SR** motors are **simpler** than
permanent-magnet motors, more rugged]{.underline} (so they're widely
used, ironically, in mining equipment), [more easily maintained, and
equally light and compact]{.underline}. [They can switch in milliseconds
between serving as a motor or as a generator, and spinning in either
direction. They're also more flexibly controllable, more heat-tolerant,
and cheaper for the same torque and production volume.]{.underline} The
only scarce resources associated with such capable SR machines are
familiarity, which few motor experts have, and skill in their
more-difficult design---especially at the level achieved by the UK firm
SR Drives (bought first by the US firm Emerson Electric, then by Japan's
Nidec).

[Both kinds of magnet-free machines can do everything required not only
in electric cars but also in **wind turbines**, functions often claimed
to be impossible without tons of neodymium]{.underline}. That some wind
turbines and [manufacturers use rare-earth permanent-magnet]{.underline}
generators [does not mean others must. It's better not to,]{.underline}
and the word is spreading.

Similarly, the red phosphors in compact fluorescent lamps traditionally
used europium. But those lamps have now been largely displaced by white
LEDs that use about 96 percent less europium. Moreover, new red
phosphors use no rare earths, while the latest green phosphor cuts
terbium use by more than 90 percent. Erbium in fiber-optic
repeaters---another small-quantity, high-value use of rare
earths---looks at first glance harder to substitute. But very little
erbium is needed, and fiber capacity must compete with today's
bandwidth-enhancing, multiplexing, and wireless innovations.

Some hybrid cars, like my 2001 Honda Insight, used nickel-metal-hydride
batteries containing lanthanum, but those are now largely replaced by
lighter lithium batteries, which typically use no lanthanum. (Both kinds
of batteries are also recyclable, and infrastructure for recycling is
emerging.) Tesla's market-leading lithium batteries, like its motors,
use no rare earths at all. Non-lithium batteries and potent potential
substitutes for batteries (notably graphene ultracapacitors) are also
emerging.

Moreover, all electric cars need two to three times fewer batteries if
we take obesity---weight and drag---out of their design, especially by
replacing heavy steel with light metals or with even lighter (but
stronger) carbon-fiber composites.The carbon-fiber passenger compartment
in my BMW i3 is an impressive early illustration; its carbon fiber is
paid for by needing fewer batteries. Newly commercialized manufacturing
methods can produce such carbon-fiber structures at automotive speed and
cost. Applied throughout US automaking, such ultralighting (plus better
aerodynamics and tires) could save half as much oil as OPEC produces, or
about one and one-half times as much as Saudi Arabia produces. The cost
of achieving these savings would be below \$10 per saved barrel---or
about one-fifth of the world's mid-2017 oil price.

Thus [the **most effective substitute** for rare earths, in both motors
and batteries, **isn't** another **exotic material** for making motors
or batteries; it's smarter car design that makes motors smaller and
batteries fewer. Or, even better, it could be new business
models]{.underline}---shareable services like Zipcar and GetAround,
mobility-as-a-service operations like Lyft and Uber, or autonomous
vehicles---that carry more people more miles in far fewer cars at
astonishingly lower cost, ultimately saving on the order of \$10
trillion worldwide (in net present value).

Such [examples illustrate the processes of resource efficiency and
substitution (processes that extend far beyond rare
earths]{.underline}). [Scarcity, real or perceived, drives price,
attention, R&D, and imagination. It elicits mineral
exploration:]{.underline} At the market's 2011 peak, some 190 companies
were scouring the planet for potentially profitable rare-earth deposits.
[Scarcity makes end-uses more productive, durable, and closed-cycle,
with recycling no longer an afterthought but a business imperative. It
even drives the kind of basic research that in the United States
(]{.underline}largely through the government agency ARPA-E) and in Japan
has lately come up with even more powerful supermagnets based on iron
nitride (Fe16N2) and containing no rare earths whatsoever. Sorry, China.

Remember when the 1973 and 1979 oil-price shocks triggered the
development of mobility alternatives that are now coming to market and
threatening to smother oil demand? The 2010-era rare-earth price spike
set similarly subtle but irresistible forces in motion that will make
sustained high rare-earth prices unsupportable.

Sloppy analysis. Together, these shifts in economic geology, resource
use, and innovation are extremely powerful. This isn't to say that no
rare-earth issues remain: Price instability, for example, remains a
long-term concern if greater efforts to supply the more-valuable "heavy"
subfamily of rare earths co-produce too many less-valuable "light" ones.
[But serious concern about rare earths still lacks an informed basis in
either scarcity or oligopoly. Only the echoes of less-informed prior
concerns reverberate.]{.underline}

David Abraham's 2015 scarce-metals book The Elements of Power is well
written, contains astute observations about mining complexities and
market structures, and makes many sound policy suggestions. Yet
Abraham's focus on the scarcity story slights his discussion of
substitution---which, if properly developed, would have largely
invalidated the concerns in the previous 10 chapters. Such
[scarcity-centric treatments have unfortunately reinforced a morphing of
rare-earth concerns, and of some soberly targeted government research,
into a commercial lobbying effort meant to scare us about scarcities of
strategic metals, presumably in the hope of eliciting more subsidies to
mine them]{.underline} (which was Congress's first reflex in 2010).

[Sloppy analysis is often the culprit.]{.underline} Even the relatively
careful Abraham [describes titanium as a "rare" metal]{.underline} (p.
221); [it's the fourth-most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. Some
writers claim that lithium, a light metal occasionally confused with
rare earths by novices, is too scarce to support a big electric-car
industry---a surprise to firms with vast lithium deposits in diverse
countries]{.underline}. A writer on a normally well-informed website
worries about platinum supplies for fuel cells, failing to notice that
Los Alamos National Laboratory has already cut the needed amount by
tenfold, and that fuel-cell cars won't need the catalytic converters
that now tie up far more platinum.

Economics ultimately follows physics. When I was a young Oxford don
around 1970, I visited London's Royal School of Mines, where my simple
little introduction to metal mining was being used as a freshman text.
To my astonishment, a senior professor said he'd found that the London
Metal Exchange price of every nonmonetary metal, smoothed over a decade
or so, could be predicted within a factor of about three---despite the
metals' enormous ranges in price and crustal abundance---from three
purely physical variables. These were the grade of typical ore (that is,
the ore's concentration of the desired metal), how finely that ore must
be crushed to expose a face of the ore mineral in each grain so it could
be concentrated, and how much energy was needed to smelt the metal out
of that mineral. Those physical variables were surrogates for the
required investment and energy. With an important caveat---I don't know
how his analysis (regrettably unpublished) handled crucial details of
metals produced as by-products or co-products of each other, which
greatly complicate market behavior---the professor's analysis of
physical properties' power to predict metal prices was an extraordinary
tribute to the long-run efficiency of metal markets. It also adds a
cautionary note to any claim that a particular element is scarce.
Scarcity tends ultimately to be self-correcting through price. That's
what markets do through supply and demand---they find balance at a
market-clearing price.

Rare earths do merit measured expert attention, as with any special
ingredient in important processes and products---cobalt or gallium,
indium or phosphorus. [But **rare earths** are very **unlikely** to
shift the world's **strategic balance** or create **resource
crises**,]{.underline} as many investment enthusiasts breathlessly
claimed in 2010, months before losing their shirts. Just as Saudi
Arabia's rulers are discovering that they cannot control world oil
markets, and Russia's President Putin may be starting to realize that
his struggling economy's hydrocarbons don't confer the decisive
geopolitical advantage he'd hoped, Chinese policy makers have doubtless
learned, perhaps better than some of their customers, that [rare earths
are simply **another commodity**---unusual, significant, but **unable**
to transcend the **realities** of **economics, innovation, and
trade.**]{.underline}

Most people view technology as the future, a force of good that will
generally improve quality of life around the world. In the business
sector, Silicon Valley and tech startups exhibit massive growth
potential; in manufacturing, new machinery and automation are boosting
efficiency; and in the environmental realm, green technology presents
the best prospects for decarbonization.

But as much as technology is hailed as the panacea of the future[, most
of these [innovations have a dirty underside]{.mark}:
[production]{.mark} [of]{.mark} these [new tech]{.mark}nologies
[requires]{.mark} companies to [dig up]{.mark} what are referred to as
rare earth elements ([REEs)]{.mark}.]{.underline}

REEs describe the 15 lanthanides on the periodic table (La-Lu), plus
Scandium (Sc) and Yttrium (Y). Contrary to what the name suggests, REEs
are abundant in the earth's crust. [The catch is that [they come in low
concentrations]{.mark} in minerals, and even when found, they are [hard
to separate from other elements]{.mark}, which is what makes them
"rare." Perhaps these elements also get their name from being rarely
discussed, even though everything from the iPhone to the Tesla electric
engine to LED lights use REEs. [Demand for these elements]{.mark} is
[projected to spike]{.mark} [in coming]{.mark} [years as]{.mark}
[governments]{.mark}, [organizations]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [individuals
increasingly invest in clean energy]{.mark}. An [electric car]{.mark}
[requires six times]{.mark} the [mineral inputs of a conventional
car]{.mark}, and [a wind plant requires]{.mark} [nine]{.mark}
[times]{.mark} more minerals [than a gas-fired
plant]{.mark}.]{.underline} With current estimates, demand for REEs
could increase six-fold by 2040. Lithium and cobalt demand could
increase ten to twenty times by 2050 because of electric cars. Demand
for dysprosium and neodymium is estimated to increase seven to
twenty-six times over the next 25 years as a result of electric vehicles
and wind turbines. But REEs also have grim prospects: the way companies
extract REEs largely damages communities and contaminates surrounding
areas.

Mining Externalities

There are two primary methods for [[REE mining]{.mark}, both of which
[release toxic chemicals into the environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
first involves removing topsoil and creating a leaching pond where
chemicals are added to the extracted earth to separate metals. This form
of chemical erosion is common since the chemicals dissolve the rare
earth, allowing it to be concentrated and then refined. However[,
[leaching ponds]{.mark}, full of toxic chemicals, may leak into
[groundwater]{.mark} when not properly secured and can sometimes [affect
entire waterways]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The second method involves [[drilling holes]{.mark} into the ground
using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes and rubber hoses to pump chemicals
into the earth, which also [creates]{.mark} a leaching pond with similar
problems. Additionally, PVC pipes are sometimes left in areas that are
never cleaned up.]{.underline}

Both [methods produce mountains of toxic waste, with high risk of
environmental and [health hazards]{.mark}]{.underline}. For every ton of
rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust,
9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater,
and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare
earth element ores have metals that, [when mixed with leaching pond
chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil. Most worrying is that rare
earth ores are often laced with radioactive thorium and uranium, which
[result in especially detrimental health effects]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Overall, for every ton of rare earth, 2,000 tons of toxic waste are
produced.

China currently dominates the REE market, accounting for 85 percent of
the global supply in 2016. Australia is the next largest producer
contributing 10 percent of the market, yet barely making a dent in
China's monopoly. For comparison, in 2018 China produced 120,000 tons of
REEs while the United States produced 15,000 tons. China has even used
REEs as a tool to coerce other nations: in 2010, it blocked REE exports
to Japan as punishment for Japan's detention of a Chinese captain. More
recently, it considered limiting REE exports to the United States in
response to tariffs put in place by former US President Donald Trump,
presenting a tremendous threat since the US defense industry relies
heavily on these minerals. However, only 35 percent of the world's REE
reserves are in China, raising questions about how the country has been
able to monopolize the industry.

#### REEs are worse for the environment.

[Why [REEs aren\'t green]{.mark}]{.underline}

Despite the name \"rare-earth elements,\" their abundance in our
planet\'s crust is not necessarily rare. However, their distribution is
often scattered and uneven, making their extraction in economically
viable quantities challenging. [This limited availability leads to
higher costs associated with exploration, mining and
processing.]{.underline}

[The [extraction and processing of REEs]{.mark} involves [complex and
costly techniques]{.mark} due to their low concentrations [and the need
for extensive mining and separation processes]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These processes include multiple steps such as [crushing, grinding,
flotation and chemical treatments, making them intricate and expensive
to refine.]{.underline}

Because it is no simple matter, [[REE mining and processing have]{.mark}
[significant environmental impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
[[extraction and refining processes generate large amounts of
waste]{.mark} and require the [use of hazardous chemicals]{.mark}.
Compliance with environmental regulations and responsible practices
necessitates additional investments,]{.underline} resulting in increased
production costs.

Trade policies, export restrictions and geopolitical tensions can also
impact the availability and cost of rare earth elements, leading to
price volatility and higher expenses. The health of mining and
processing personnel---as well as residents in the surrounding
areas---can be compromised when proper precautions aren't taken.

The [[economics of]{.underline}]{.mark} any
[[process]{.underline}]{.mark} has a [[**huge** impact
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[deployment of]{.underline}]{.mark} such
process, and the technologies of [[RERs]{.underline}]{.mark} is a good
example for this rule, as its implementation has been hindered for a
long time due to the unfavorable economics associated with high capital
and operating expenditure (CAPEX and OPEX), hence higher energy cost.
Accordingly, RERs [[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[been]{.mark}
[challenged to acquire]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[required
financing]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a long time. In general, the
[[market for RERs]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [[**challenged**
by]{.underline}]{.mark} two factors: first, was the **[[high capital
investment requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}**, second: the hard
[[**competition** with]{.underline}]{.mark} traditional **[[fossil fuel
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with the latter being
well-establishment and mature technologies. This has [[made RERs
projects]{.mark} [economically **non-viable**]{.mark}]{.underline} for a
long time, with a high payback period and limited market size. Hence the
LCOE "levelized cost of energy" was for a long time unfavorable for RERs
projects, making their financing another challenge.

The energy [[sector]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [highly
[**controlled** by fossil energy]{.mark}]{.underline} resources
[since]{.underline} the [start of]{.underline} the
[industrialization]{.underline} era. This was until the 1970s, with the
huge increase in fossil fuels\' prices, along with the increased
environmental awareness when strong attention was given to RERs as a
secure, available, and more environmentally friendly energy source. It
was [[not until]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[recently]{.underline}]{.mark}, [when]{.underline} the LCOE of
[[RERs]{.underline}]{.mark}, more specifically for PV and wind, to
[[**compete** with fossil]{.underline}]{.mark} resources.
[However]{.underline}, RERs [[projects still require
**huge**]{.underline}]{.mark} capital [[investment]{.underline}]{.mark},
which is currently favored by regulations and incentives. Governments
have been generally supporting the economics of RERs projects through
environmental or green incentives, exemptions (for taxes, duties, and

support.

technological advancements, Solar-PV technology serves as a notable
illustration of progress, as the latest iteration of 3rd generation
Solar-PV cells has successfully addressed numerous challenges pertaining
to efficiency and cost. Advancements in Solar-PV technology have yielded
several notable benefits, including reduced costs, less energy-intensive
manufacturing processes, and the utilization of abundant material
resources, thereby circumventing the need for precious and scarce
metals.

One of the [[most difficult aspects of RERs
projects]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[connecting to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[electricity grid]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is made [[more
difficult by its **intermittent nature**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Variable
renewable energy (VREs) is a term that describes a type of renewable
energy, such as solar and wind and their highly intermittent nature when
compared to other RERs \[116,127\]. Eenergy storage systems ESSs have
been largely recognized as the ultimate solution to smoothing out the
RERs power generation scheme. One [[additional technical
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} that hinders the implementation of RERs
projects [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**limited availability**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} skilled [[labor]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[installation]{.underline}, commissioning, operation, and maintenance
[of RERs]{.underline} typically [[necessitate]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[involvement of]{.underline}]{.mark} highly **[[skilled
labor]{.underline}]{.mark}** with specialized expertise. The
[[**limited** availability of training facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}
and accumulated experience in the field of RERs has hindered their
widespread deployment. Moreover, the prevailing standards, norms,
certification procedures, and requirements have been formulated taking
into consideration the utilization of fossil fuel resources.
Consequently, a comprehensive technical analysis of these codes and
standards is required to modify and incorporate the RERs initiatives.

[[Social barriers]{.underline}]{.mark} are mainly [[related
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**weak awareness** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[public. Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the widely [[**communicated
merits** of RERs]{.underline}]{.mark} and the general support of the
public, there are still has some social barriers. RERs [[projects are
**site-specific**]{.underline}]{.mark} in nature, so acceptance of the
local community has a significant impact in their implementation, that
is clear in the case of wind energy projects which is highly accepted by
framers as it does not hinder land use. [[**Hinder** and **alteration**
of land use is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the [[main obstacles for
accepting RERs among]{.underline}]{.mark} local
[[communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, as experienced with hydropower,
solar, and bioenergy RERs projects.

RERs have been widely viewed as a very environmentally friendly energy
source, which is true but only to a certain extent. RERs are much more
environmentally friendly and greener than current traditional fossil
resources in terms of GHGs emissions and many other environmental
impacts. However, [[RERs still pose]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[[environmental impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} as any man-made or
synthetic process, which has been the subject of many research efforts
\[101,128\]. [[Wind energy]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [[reported to

**[pollution]{.mark}**]{.underline} effects at installation sites and
[[effects on]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[local

[[use of precious **metal resources** and energy-intensive
processes]{.underline}]{.mark} to produce PV cells have
[[shown]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[huge **environmental
impact**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similar impacts are shared with other
RERs, which must be well considered, and accepted by the local community
and environmental entities. Awareness and public acceptance are strongly
related to cultural and behavioral aspects of the local community at the
RER project site and at the consumption site as well in relation to the
end-user.

RERs=Renewable Energy Resources

Why the [[regulatory landscape is a **double-edged**
sword]{.underline}]{.mark}

Initially conceived as bulwarks protecting the environment,
[[regulations]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[**paradoxically evolved**
into]{.underline} [**formidable** barriers
obstructing]{.underline}]{.mark} the realization of [[clean
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} projects.

At the forefront of this regulatory conundrum in the US stands the
National Environmental Policy Act ([[NEPA]{.underline}]{.mark}),
[enacted with noble intentions]{.underline} in the 1970s to
[ensure]{.underline} that [developers]{.underline} meticulously
[assess]{.underline} the **[environmental ramifications]{.underline}**
of their projects. However, the [[unintended
consequence]{.underline}]{.mark} of NEPA\'s provisions has been the
[[empowerment of **affluent** stakeholders to employ **litigation**
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a potent [tool [to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[stymie
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Why embracing power transmission is key to tackling climate change

Consequently, what was once conceived as a safeguard against
environmental degradation has inadvertently become a weapon against
building clean energy projects.

Moreover, the [[proliferation of **state** and **local**
barriers]{.underline}]{.mark}, epitomized by moratoriums on nuclear
energy, a halt to planned pipelines carrying captured carbon dioxide,
and [[**impeded** efforts to mine]{.underline}]{.mark} minerals, further
exacerbates the regulatory quagmire, impeding the swift realization of
clean energy objectives.

Local resistance to clean energy initiatives

Beyond NEPA, [[**regional gridlock** and]{.underline}]{.mark} local
[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[compound]{.underline}]{.mark} the permitting
[[conundrum]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[perpetuating]{.underline}]{.mark} a
cycle of [[**stagnation** and **resistance** to clean
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} initiatives.

Take, for instance, the protracted permitting process for [[connecting
new clean energy plants to]{.underline}]{.mark} the power
[[grid]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Midwest, where the average timeline
stretches to almost [**[four years]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Moreover, at the state and local levels, [[elected
officials]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[erect barriers
to]{.underline}]{.mark} specific forms of [[clean energy]{.underline},
**[hindering progress]{.underline}**]{.mark} toward a sustainable
future.

Consider the example of [[US states maintain]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[**moratoriums** on]{.underline}]{.mark} new [[nuclear energy
**despite**]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[potential]{.underline}]{.mark} to
provide 24/7 clean, reliable energy. The Biden administration's
Department of Energy estimates that an additional 200 gigawatts of firm
capacity will be needed to meet net-zero emissions by 2050 and
acknowledged that deploying advanced reactors could help fill that void.
Yet since the 1970s, 16 states have instituted bans on nuclear energy in
one form or another, and moratoriums remain in place in 12 states.

\<\<CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

This isn't just a problem in the US. In Germany, there has been
opposition to offshore wind while they also begin to phase out nuclear
energy for ideological rather than technical reasons. Wind and other
clean energy projects have also hit opposition in Norway. Australia
won't allow nuclear energy, but last year, they said they wouldn't ban
new coal. The list goes on around the world. Despite this widespread
resistance, there remains a glimmer of hope. As an eternal optimist, I
firmly believe that balanced environmental regulation is key to
overcoming these hurdles. Take the US Clean Water Act, for instance,
which was a testament to the transformative power of effective
legislation in addressing environmental crises when the heavily polluted
Cuyahoga River in Ohio quite literally caught fire. However, tackling
the permitting emergency necessitates environmentalists\' collective
effort to rally behind new and retrofitted clean energy ventures,
irrespective of past preferences. Furthermore, it\'s imperative for
developers to recognize the importance of aesthetics in their projects.
Advanced nuclear developers have demonstrated this by incorporating
elements of nature into their designs, fostering community engagement
and acceptance. This attention to detail may seem trivial but can
significantly enhance public perception and support. In essence,
embracing a multifaceted approach encompassing regulatory reform,
community engagement, and political advocacy can pave the way for a
sustainable energy future. Charting a course towards clean energy
Drawing inspiration from international precedents such as Spain\'s
streamlined regulatory processes, the US must enact bold policy reforms
to navigate the regulatory maze stifling clean energy expansion.
Automatic permitting mechanisms such as pre-clearance for low-impact
projects coupled with expedited review processes for high-impact
ventures represent pivotal steps toward catalyzing progress. Leveraging
lessons from past crises, such as the 2005 energy crisis, where the US
made it easier to obtain permits for oil and gas production on public
lands, we should do the same with clean energy. If you are for a
transition, why not give developers the same opportunities to advance
renewables like geothermal on public lands? Common projects with minimal
environmental impact should be automatically greenlit and reviewed after
the fact to help speed up the process for overwhelmingly positive clean
energy infrastructure. Things like solar sites or nuclear plants on a
retired coal plant site should be a quick approval that can be monitored
later to ensure they remain in compliance with existing environmental
laws. For those that do need permits up front, we should set a one-year
deadline for how long the reviews can take, three-month limits to file
any lawsuits and six months to adjudicate the suits.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Too many [[clean energy projects experience delays
of]{.underline}]{.mark} years, sometimes [[decades]{.underline}]{.mark},
largely [[because of]{.underline} **[obstructive litigation
practices]{.underline}**]{.mark}. We [[must strike]{.underline}]{.mark}
the right [[balance]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[[allowing]{.underline}]{.mark} legitimate [[judicial
review]{.underline}]{.mark} while halting the never-ending cycle.

### Mining Fails\-\--1NC

#### Greenland mines are overhyped and inconsistent - not worth pursuing compared to other mines

**Christiansen '25** \[Flemming G.; May 8; Greenland mining and geology
consultant; IEEE Spectrum; "Can Geopolitics Unlock Greenland's Critical
Materials Treasure Chest?";
https://spectrum.ieee.org/greenland-rare-earth-minerals\]

**[[The Deposits Are Big but Have Low Concentrations of Rare Earth
Elements]{.underline}]{.mark}**

According to the European Union, Greenland has great untapped potential
for 25 of the 34 minerals identified in the Union's official list of raw
materials, including rare earth elements, graphite, platinum group
metals, and niobium. Looking at these in more detail, however, a more
complex picture emerges. In 2023, an investigation for the Center for
Mineral Resources and Materials of the Geological Survey of Denmark and
Greenland found that [[Greenland's mineral resources included everything
from minor occurrences to substantial deposits scattered around the
island]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Of Greenland's 10 important]{.mark} rare earth [deposits]{.mark}, [only
two]{.mark}, Kvanefjeld (Kuannersuit) and Kringlerne (Killavaat
Alannguat), [have attracted much attention]{.mark}.

In spite of being located just a few miles apart in the same complex in
South Greenland, these two rare earth deposits are very different for
all parameters: geology and mineralogy, stage of exploration, and
documented resources. They are alike, however, in that [[both deposits
have some **serious drawbacks when compared with active mines or
advanced projects elsewhere**]{.mark} in the Wes]{.underline}t.

[[Kvanefjeld is the only project in Greenland with well-documented
reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it suffers from--or, some would say,
could potentially benefit from--a high content of uranium and thorium.

In 2021, [[when the project was in the final phase of getting an
exploitation license]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [Greenland]{.mark}ic
government dug in its heels and [[made it illegal to mine
deposits]{.underline}]{.mark} with more than 100 parts per million of
uranium. The new regulations were used against the Australian company
behind the Kvanefjeld project, [[rendering worthless years of heavy
investments; more than US \$100 million was reportedly spent on
drilling]{.mark}]{.underline} and other work.

The company filed a request for arbitration in 2022, and in 2024 it
commenced legal proceedings against the Greenland and Danish
governments. It may be years before these cases are resolved. In the
meantime, this case is likely to harm investment in Greenland due to the
[climate of high political risk it suggests]{.underline}.

[[At Kringlerne]{.mark} there are much lower concentrations of
uranium]{.underline}. The privately owned company that has invested in
the site, Tanbreez, claims that it is the largest deposit of its kind in
the world, but that belief is based on very little drilling. In 2020,
the company got an exploration license in spite of not having provided
documentation of resources, updated studies of feasibility, or of
environmental and socioeconomic impact. Deadlines for providing
financial security and plans for mining and closure were extended for
many years. Tanbreez was partly taken over by a New York--based
company registered on the NASDAQ, and the new owners were obligated to
follow international standards and disclose a confidential resource
estimate from 2016. [[The report revealed considerably more
disappointing numbers with regard to ore grade and other
characteristics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**Nor do Greenland's deposits fare well in comparison with other mines
or deposits.** [Typical ore grades at successful mines or attractive
deposits are **between 4 and 8 percent rare
earths**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} The ore at the mines at Mount Weld in
Australia and Mountain Pass in California, and the deposits at Nolans
Bore in Australia and Bear Lodge in Wyoming, all fall within that range.
**[[In Kvanefjeld the number is 1.4 percent, and in Kringlerne,]{.mark}
it dips as low as [0.38 percent]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[The
Greenlandic mines would]{.mark} consequently [require larger open pits
and]{.mark} much [more energy for crushing, separation, and refining,
which would inevitably drive up costs for establishing mines and
for]{.mark} actually [operating them]{.mark}]{.underline}.

President-elect Donald [Trump]{.underline} has [said]{.underline} the
[U.S. needs Greenland for]{.underline} national [security]{.underline}.
Part of the island's allure are its rare earths, metals and other raw
materials. [America]{.underline} now mostly [relies on
China]{.underline} [for]{.underline} its supplies of some [key
materials]{.underline}, and [Beijing could wield]{.underline} its
[access]{.underline} to them [as]{.underline} a [weapon]{.underline} in
a trade war.

But [[Greenland's **harsh climate**]{.underline}, **[hazardous
shipping]{.underline}**, [**limited infrastructure** and
tiny]{.underline}]{.mark} local [[workforce have]{.underline}]{.mark}
for years [[left]{.underline}]{.mark} a promised [[gold rush
**frozen**]{.underline}]{.mark} in its tracks.

Increasing geopolitical competition, rising need for rare elements and a
warming climate are now fueling hopes for the development of a mining
industry on Greenland. Any significant extraction, though, is still
years away, experts and industry participants say.

"Greenland is starting to become much more attractive to those who are
hoping to potentially break the very strong influence of China in rare
earth exports, and climate change helps with some of the issues," said
Marc Lanteigne, professor at the University of Tromsø and an adjunct
lecturer at the University of Greenland.

President-elect Donald Trump hasn't ruled out military action in what
some call a far-fetched pledge for control of Greenland. Here's why any
bid for the Danish territory is complicated and controversial.

"What does not change, though, is the overall conditions, including a
[[lack of infrastructure and labor]{.underline}]{.mark}, that [[make
mining]{.underline}]{.mark} considerably [[**challenging**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} considerably
**[[expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said. "There have been many
lofty plans but very little in the way of actual developments."

Since winning the election, Trump has raised the idea of taking control
of Greenland from Denmark and threatened to hit Denmark with tariffs if
it doesn't cooperate. Most recently, the president-elect has refused to
rule out the use of force to take the island, the world's largest.
Officials in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, and Denmark, a
U.S. ally and fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, have
rejected the idea of the island becoming part of the U.S.

[[Local]{.underline}]{.mark} officials, however, [[have
welcomed]{.underline}]{.mark} increased [[U.S. investment in
mining]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular. The island has recently
stepped up its push for independence from Denmark, which maintains some
control over the island, including its foreign policy.

On Monday, Greenland's Prime Minister Múte [[Egede]{.underline}]{.mark}
said the island didn't want to be American. However, Egede added that
[he [wanted]{.mark}]{.underline} to pursue [[**deeper collaboration**
with the U.S. on]{.underline}]{.mark} defense, and welcomed U.S.
investment in [[Greenland's mining industry]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The share prices of Greenland-focused mining companies shot up in the
wake of Trump's remarks.

Mira Kleist, head of Greenland practice at advisory firm Kaya Partners,
said she had been fielding increased interest from companies and
investors in mining. She attributes the interest to geopolitical
developments and advancing climate change, which could make it easier to
operate as the land becomes free from ice for longer parts of the year.
The retreating ice could also reveal new mineral-rich areas as it
exposes bedrock that has lain icebound for millennia.

Still, despite all the interest in Greenland's potential, the island has
two active mines, and they aren't involved in the extraction of critical
minerals. The territory has extended around 100 active mining licenses,
mostly for exploration, with some further along.

**[[High startup costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** are a particular issue:
Any [[mine would]{.underline}]{.mark} have to [[be built from scratch
in]{.underline}]{.mark} Greenland's [[rugged
terrain]{.underline},]{.mark} with its deep fjords and ice sheets that
can be up to a mile thick. The island doesn't have roads between
settlements, while the floating sea ice off the coast makes shipping
treacherous. The island's population of around 57,000 people likely
means importing foreign workers.

Greenland's decision to ban mining for uranium in recent years also
spooked some investors, who want to see successful projects come to
fruition before plowing in financing.

"There has always been a lot of hype, a lot of talk of the potential
there," said Flemming Getreuer Christiansen, a geoscience consultant
with decades of experience in the region. "Trump's interest may wake up
interest now, but the challenges remain the same."

A Greenland government official acknowledged the challenges of
attracting capital but said future [**cooperation** with the
U.S.]{.underline} would [help **uncover** opportunities]{.underline} to
[tap in to]{.underline} the **[territory's potential]{.underline}**.
Around 7% of its ice-free area is covered by permits, leaving "plenty of
room for increased exploration," he said.

The craggy hills along Greenland's coastal areas are endowed with a vast
array of raw materials such as rare earths, graphite, copper and
lithium---all critical commodities for green technologies,
artificial-intelligence chips and military technologies.

A SSN-774 Virginia-class submarine requires around 9,200 pounds of
rare-earth materials while an F-35 Lightning II aircraft needs some 920
pounds of the materials, according to a 2013 U.S. Congressional Research
Service report. The European Commission says that 25 of the 34 critical
raw materials it identifies as "strategically important" for Europe's
industry and green transition can be found in Greenland.

China dominates production and export of many of those raw materials.
The U.S. depends on China for 72% of its imports of rare earths and more
than 40% for its graphite requirements, according to U.S. government
data and S&P Global Mobility.

A future mining hub---or missed opportunity?

Greenland's rich mineral deposits offer the potential for economic
diversification beyond fishing and tourism.

However, the [combination of [logistical, regulatory, and local
opposition]{.mark} challenges]{.underline} [[means]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [large-scale [mining]{.mark}]{.underline} projects [[remain
**uncertain**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

With global demand for rare-earth minerals increasing, Greenland's

[While critical minerals are likely in **Greenland**]{.underline}, [it
is [unclear if mining is **economically viable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
That\'s where exploration comes in. \"[[**Mineral exploration**
is]{.mark} amongst the most [challenging and **risky**]{.mark} of
enterprises related to **mining**]{.underline},\" says Simon Jowitt,
director of the Ralph J. Roberts Center for Research and Economic
Geology at the University of Nevada, Reno. He notes that for every 100
mineral exploration projects, one of them might turn into a mine.

If the [**[exploration]{.mark}** efforts reveal a mine\'s
potential]{.underline}, on average, [it [can still take about **10
years** to]{.mark} go from discovery to
**[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Jowitt says. \"It all depends on
where you are, what the infrastructure is, what permitting and other
things you have to do to make sure that you\'re going to be mining in a
conscientious way.\"

[[**Greenland** has a notable lack of
**infrastructure**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- once out of the cities,
[there are [no]{.mark} roads or **[railroads]{.mark}** [through the
**countryside**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"[Getting around isn\'t

terrain in Greenland," says Jowitt. Travel is done by boat or air, not
car. The lack of established infrastructure, notes Jowitt, [could [prove

But the waste rock was not inert.

\"The level of [**[heavy metals]{.mark}** has [been very

[[a dose of sobriety to]{.mark} all [the talk of Greenland as the land
of]{.mark} [incalculable mineral riches]{.mark}]{.underline}. He noted
that though the island has dozens of exploratory projects, there are
only two active mines: his and a small gold operation.

#### Mining companies in Greenland would face immense transportation, labor, and political challenges

But **[[for every square on the periodic table that Greenland can fill,
there's an even longer list of challenges.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Besides the extreme weather, [the [island has fewer than 100 miles of
roads]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} only 56,000 residents (which
means [[a tiny labor pool]{.mark})]{.underline} [[and a few small
ports]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Equally daunting]{.underline}]{.mark} for miners [[is Greenland's
environmentalist lobby]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many Greenlanders say they
need more mining to become economically and politically independent of
Denmark, which keeps it afloat with hundreds of millions of dollars in
annual subsidies.

But Greenlanders have also expressed caution about any new heavy
industry. They are protective of their environment, which is being
shaken up by climate change: The Arctic is warming nearly four times as
fast as the rest of the world, which will most likely make the mineral
resources more accessible.

[[The island's governing political party]{.underline}]{.mark} swept into
office four years ago on an environmentalist platform and [**[shut down
one of the most promising mining projects]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The
next elections]{.mark} are on March 11, and, along with independence
from Denmark and closer relations with the United States, [safeguarding
the environment is at the top of the agenda.]{.mark}

For many Greenlanders, nature is a part of their identity and something
they connect to through fishing, hunting, hiking and spending time
outdoors.

"We have lived with nature for as long as we have been here, in
sustainable ways," said Ellen Kristensen, an environmentalist in South
Greenland.

Not far from her community is [the small gold mine. Amaroq
Minerals]{.mark}, which is backed by Icelandic, Canadian and other
Western investors, extracted its first gold in November. Its chief
executive, Eldur Olafsson, says [the remoteness of his mine means the
company has to be self-sufficient in energy, supplies and transportation
--- just about everything]{.mark}.

"**[[Operating in Greenland is unlike anything
else]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said.

#### Mining companies in Greenland fail

[[Greenland is littered with **shuttered projects and abandoned
sites**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A ruby mine near the east coast closed in
2022 amid soaring debts. Around the same time, Greenland's government
formally abandoned its oil ambitions, citing the lack of commercial
viability and the unacceptable environmental risks.

Even the search for diamonds has yet to lead to a commercially viable
mine.

These days, much of the interest lies in rare earths, but [[a big rare
earth mine in southern Greenland remains a cautionary
tale]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Energy Transition Minerals, [[an Australian mining
enterprise]{.underline}]{.mark} with a sizable investment from a Chinese
company, [[claims its site in Greenland]{.mark} h[as one of the world's
largest deposits]{.mark} of rare earth oxides]{.underline}. [The]{.mark}
[[company spent **more than \$100 million developing it**, only to have
Greenland's governing party]{.underline}]{.mark}, Inuit Ataqatigiit,
which had campaigned on [[kill]{.mark}ing [the
project]{.mark},]{.underline} do exactly that.

The opposition was strongest in Narsaq, the town closest to the site,
where residents feared radioactive contamination. Uranium is often found
in deposits of rare earth minerals, and the concern was that the mine
could send toxic dust floating over the community.

[[Residents]{.mark} of Narsaq]{.underline}, a town of 1,700 in
Greenland, [[opposed a rare earth mine over concerns about]{.mark}

Among the residents leading the protests was Ms. Kristensen, whose
husband is a sheep farmer. "Nobody wants to buy meat from sheep grazing
next to a uranium mine," she said.

Like many others, she marched through Narsaq's snowy streets carrying
bright yellow signs that said in Greenlandic language, "Urani? Naamik,"
which means: "Uranium? No."

[[The mining company]{.underline}]{.mark} says that its operations are

[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[position]{.mark}ing
[itself]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as a solution]{.underline}]{.mark} for
the many European governments that are looking [to rely less on China
for critical raw materials]{.underline} --- which are essential for the
manufacture of goods like electric cars.

The G-7 member announced in December a plan to ramp up the production of
these minerals, with [[Canada]{.mark} [havi]{.mark}ng [one of the
**largest deposits**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Canada is [[estimated]{.mark}
to have [over **15.1 million metric tons**]{.mark} [of rare earth
oxide]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [European Union,]{.underline} and other parts of the world, are
[trying to be less dependent on China]{.underline} [while]{.underline}
also [accelerating plans for a more sustainable economy]{.underline}.
From a European perspective, officials are worried about Beijing
potentially using its dominant role in raw materials in a similar way to
how Russia started weaponizing gas against the bloc.

"We've seen \[that\] the [resilience of supply chains really
matter]{.underline}\[s\], the way in which [minerals maybe mined will
really matter]{.underline}," Mary Ng, Canada's international trade
minister, told CNBC Tuesday.

According to government data, it might take between 5 and 25 years for a
mining project to become operational, so the Canadian authorities are
trying to speed up the approval process for news plants.

More broadly, there's a [[growing recognition]{.mark}]{.underline} by
several governments [[that minerals]{.mark} and other raw
materials]{.underline} [[are]{.mark} now a matter of **[national
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has become a reality in the
European Union, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine highlighting that the
bloc had become solely reliant on one huge supplier.

[Canada wants to be a part of the solution]{.underline}.

Mary Ng

Canada's International Trade Minister

Speaking in Canada earlier this month, European Commission President
Ursula von der Leyen said: "We see today that, for example, China
produces 98% of Europe's supplies of rare earths. And Europe needs to
de-risk this dependency."

When asked if [[Canada was keen to topple China]{.mark}]{.underline} in
becoming the main supplier of critical materials for the planned green
transition in the West, Ng said: "If I take a look at one statistic that
was recently issued, [Canada [now]{.mark} is [number two
]{.mark}]{.underline}in the battery ecosystem space.

"So [that is number two [next to China]{.mark}]{.underline}," she said,
adding that Ottawa was number five in these rankings "not that long
ago."

"**[[Canada wants to be a part of the solution]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
We [already are collaborating in areas of hydrogen]{.underline}, we're

\... that resilient supply chain across the Atlantic is certainly
something that we are absolutely doing," she added.

#### b. [AUSTRALIA]{.underline}\-\--massive untapped ore deposits and opportunity for business

**Dawkins 24** -- Ruth Dawkins is journalist and writer for CSIRO, The
Washington Post, the Guardian and Observer. (10-18-2024; \"Unlocking the
power of Australia's rare earth elements\"; No Publication;

7-10-2025)

[Demand for rare earth elements (REE) is soaring.]{.underline} According
to the International Energy Agency's Global Critical Minerals Outlook
2024, [global demand]{.underline} for magnet REE [nearly]{.underline}
[doubled between 2015 and 2023]{.underline}. It has the [potential to
double again by 2050,]{.underline} in large part driven by the growth of
clean energy technologies.

With [at least **[four per cent]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the world's
[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lement reserves]{.underline}
concentrated [[in Australia]{.underline}]{.mark}, we are [[well
positioned to capitalise]{.mark} on this growing market]{.underline}.
But key to that will be unlocking the potential of lower grade deposits
and extending Australian value chains.

The Australian Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub brings
together expertise from Australia's leading science agencies: CSIRO, the
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and
Geoscience Australia, to scale up and commercialise Australia's critical
minerals potential. The three [[agencies]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[[work]{.mark}ing]{.underline} together [[to accelerate]{.mark} the
[discovery]{.mark}, extraction [and processing]{.mark} of REE from lower
grade deposits]{.underline}. We are also exploring how to support
industry stakeholders who are working downstream in the value chain.

Dr Chris Vernon is our Critical Minerals Lead. He believes [[Australia
has **untapped potential**]{.underline}]{.mark} with relatively
[substantial ore deposits]{.underline}, some of which are rich in
high-grade ore. There are [[also]{.mark} [several]{.mark}, previously
overlooked [resources]{.mark} that [appear very
promising]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include some very large but lower
quality ores, by Australian standards.

\"The mineralogy of some of these non-traditional ores makes them easier
to process than the traditional ores, so there's a trade-off between
grade, and ease of processing,\" Chris says.

\"If we can then also develop the technology to move further along the
value chain, that will bring some certainty and diversity to
international supply chains. I think de-risking REE supply chains is
going to be a key role for Australia."

Rare earth elements: a basic explainer

St. John/Flickr)

Rare earths are a group of 16 metallic elements that occur together in
the periodic table. They include the 15 lanthanides plus yttrium.

Despite their name, REE are relatively plentiful in the earth's crust.
However, they are typically quite dispersed and not found in high enough
concentrations that make them viable to mine. As a group, REE are
considered a specific subcategory of critical mineral.

"When we talk about critical minerals, that usually means a mineral that
is difficult to get, either because of the economics or because of
problems with supply chains," Chris says.

"There are 31 critical minerals, and rare earths are included in there,
but they also have distinct definitions within that group."

Rare earths are often described as being light or heavy. Light REE
include lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium and neodymium. They appear
towards the left of the periodic table and they are far more common.

In contrast, heavy REE are less common. They have higher atomic numbers
and appear towards the right-hand side of the table and include elements
like thulium, ytterbium and lutetium.

What all REE have in common -- and what makes them so important as the
world undergoes a rapid energy transition -- is their strong optical or
magnetic properties. Some of the rare earths, including samarium,
praseodymium, neodymium, dysprosium and terbium make very strong
magnets. They are a key component in the motors that drive wind turbines
and electric vehicles.

Improving our knowledge of clay-hosted REE deposits

Researchers and industry already have a good understanding of the
techniques for extracting and processing REE. This includes from high
grade deposits that contain REE-bearing minerals such as monazite,
xenotime and bastnäsite.

But the next step is to deepen our understanding of the formation,
mineralogy and processing routes for lower grade deposits --
particularly clay-hosted REE.

"We've got [a **[lot]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} what are often
considered ["[primary" sources in Australia]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that
is, well-recognised rare earth minerals, [at relatively high
grade]{.underline}," Chris says.

"[Mount Weld]{.underline} is [[one of the **richest** sources]{.mark} of
rare earths [in the world]{.mark}]{.underline} with grades of several
percent rare earths. But the distribution of the rare earths is skewed
towards the lighter end, which is quite common. There's another emerging
style of deposit though, which is clay hosted."

According to Chris, when you analyse a clay earth deposit, the total
rare earths is often much lower than you'd find somewhere like Mount
Weld. However, the amount of heavy -- the less abundant and more
valuable -- REE can be comparable to a traditional deposit. That means
they could have an important role to play in providing a resilient and
sustainable supply chain of heavy REE, despite the low total rare earth
grade.

To gain insights into the geological processes and conditions that form
clay-hosted REE deposits, we are applying expertise in regolith
geoscience, geophysics, and remote sensing. This will enable us to
produce deposit-scale case studies across various landscape environments
where clay-hosted REE prospects occur.

Samples from these case studies are being analysed. Researchers are
using cutting edge characterisation facilities to understand variability
in mineralogy which ultimately controls mineral processing. Results will
be incorporated into mineral system models for clay-hosted REE. These
models are being developed by hub partner Geoscience Australia as part
of their review of Australia's priority REE mineral deposit styles.

Dr Rachael Morgan is Geoscience Australia's Critical Mineral Research
and Development Hub Lead. She explains that a mineral system is defined
as all geological factors that control the generation and preservation
of mineral deposits.

"A mineral system model quantifies the controls on deposit formation by
identifying factors such as fluid, structures, and changes in source and
host rock chemistry, in order to develop an understanding of how a
particular deposit may have formed," she says.

Using the knowledge gained from developing the mineral system model,
researchers can identify relevant national datasets. These datasets can
then be used as proxies to map the controls on deposit formation.

\"These dataset layers are combined to produce a national mineral
potential map that indicates the regions of Australia that are most
prospective for clay-hosted REE deposits, and these maps can be used by
industry to identify priority areas for exploration."

"The project will expand our geological understanding of Australia's
potential to host deposits of this style," says Geoscience Australia's
project lead Dr Jessica Walsh.

"This will support new exploration and discovery in Australia for
clay-hosted REE deposits and should ultimately lead to increasing
Australia's inventory of REE, heavy-REE in particular. Collaborating on
understanding how these deposits are formed also highlights where there
are gaps in knowledge and data, which can then lead to further
research."

Unlocking the potential of lower grade deposits

The collaborative research with Geoscience Australia that will lead to a
better understanding of deposit characterisation. We are also partnering
with ANSTO on research that will accelerate the discovery and recovery
from such deposits. That work will include the development of a pilot
plant at ANSTO.

Dr James Quinn, Senior Hydrometallurgist, ANSTO Minerals, points out
that traditional 'ionic clay' deposits have been previously exploited
overseas.

"The [[REE]{.underline}]{.mark} [contained within such deposits are
[relatively **easy to extract**]{.mark}]{.underline} as opposed to
'clay-hosted' deposits where REE require harsher processing conditions
to extract them and realise the value within.

"We have a lot of this style of 'clay-hosted' deposit within Australia,
but there is a bit of uncertainty around how to process them
efficiently, economically and in the most environmentally sustainable
way. Also, ensuring that the intermediate REE-containing concentrates
produced from them are compatible with existing downstream processing
facilities is a key point."

In addition to developing a pilot plant that will allow Australian
developers to test their ores at a relatively large scale, ANSTO is also
[developing processing [flowsheets]{.mark} specifically [for]{.mark}
Australian [clay-hosted deposits]{.mark} and the intermediate
REE-containing concentrates they are likely to produce]{.underline}.
That [will [ensure they perform well economically and
environmentally]{.mark}]{.underline} and are tailored to Australian
regulations, which are usually stricter than you would see elsewhere.

Downstream value chain

Another focus of the Australian Critical Minerals Research and
Development Hub is research that will extend Australian value chains for
REE. In particular, the project aims to produce rare earth material for
magnet making industries. This is an exciting opportunity to leverage
Australia's resource potential to support onshore processing and create
opportunities in downstream high value industries.

"Traditionally, Australia has been an exporter of raw materials rather
than a processor. With rare earths, it can be challenging to make a
high-grade oxide material because there's no domestic market for that.
There's no one who can use it,\" Chris says.

One of the key aims of the project is to create the processes and the
intellectual property around turning those materials into metals here in
Australia.

"Once you've gone to metals, you've skipped a lot of the supply chain
that you don't understand," he says.

"It doesn't have to be about making magnets or electric vehicles
domestically. It's just about getting to the point where we can separate
them, then turn them into metals, and then suddenly you have a product
that is immediately marketable to Europe or the US. That helps the
international supply chain look a little less bottlenecked and a little
more certain."

Collaboration for national benefit

While [several]{.underline} major [companies]{.underline} in Australia
[are well established in conventional REE extraction]{.underline} and
mineral concentrate production, the **[[emerging
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}** around clay-hosted deposits [presents
[opportunities for]{.mark} [more companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[could lead to an [increased number of businesses]{.mark}]{.underline}
mining and extracting REE in Australia.

According to Dr Chris Griffith, Principal Consultant at ANSTO Minerals,
supporting these companies to meet the growing demand for REE and other
critical minerals demonstrates the value of critical minerals processing
expertise already present within Australia's government science
agencies.

"The Australian Critical Minerals Research and Development Hub is about
getting the most out of the expertise that exists across our science
agencies and bringing that together for the benefit of Australian
industry," he says.

"[[We have]{.mark} such [an **abundance**]{.mark} of resources
here]{.underline}; it makes sense to try and bring as much of the
processing back onshore as we can -- adding value to what we have and
diversifying global supply chains. That's what the Hub is trying to
facilitate."

[[Rare Earth Elements]{.mark} are [becoming]{.mark} [increasingly
important]{.mark}]{.underline} in the world's green transition.
[[Australia]{.mark} should become [a more **proactive
contributor**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Imagine a world without screens. No laptops, smartphones, or TVs.
Imagine a world without electric vehicles, wind turbines or solar
panels. Probably, the world our ancestors used to live in is
unimaginable to us. All of these products, as well as many other
high-tech products, require Rare Earth Elements (REEs). These REEs are
17 elements of the periodic table that can, in fact, be found in many
locations all over the world, but only in a few are they found in such
abundance that they can be mined. While REEs gained notoriety already in
the 1980s, it was probably in 2010 when countries realised their
critical relevance and the leverage that countries enjoy that control
them. China in the 1980s, worried about their dependence on oil, went
ahead of its time in a smart move by ramping up their REEs mining and
processing, which allowed them to overtake the United States as the
dominant supplier by the late 1990s.

A maritime quarrel in 2010 between Japanese coastguards and a Chinese
trawler was followed by China temporarily halting REEs exports to Japan.
As China had at that time 97 percent of the market share in the
production of REEs, this was a wake-up call not only for the Japanese
government but for the entire global community. This was the time when
the West realised that such resources gave China tremendous geopolitical
power, and that the green revolution required readily available and
low-cost REEs. Herein, REEs received the adjective "critical."

The global community is facing a serious problem and Australia is part
of its solution.

Economic and geopolitical significance of rare earth

In 2010, the global reserves of rare earth minerals slightly declined
from a peak of 140 million metric tons (mt) to 110 million, with China
holding the majority at 44 million mt. The US and others like Vietnam,
Russia, and Brazil also maintain significant reserves. Production has
since surged to 350,000 mt (2023), highlighting the growing demand for
technology and renewable energy solutions.

China's control over rare earth production and reserves substantially
influences international trade, leading other nations to seek
diversification and reduced dependency through international cooperation
and policy measures. Efforts include strengthening domestic mining
sectors and innovation in industries like electric vehicles, and their
batteries, to minimise reliance on rare earths. For example, to reduce
dependency on REEs and address environmental and supply chain concerns,
electric vehicle giant Tesla has announced plans to design future models
that will minimise or eliminate the need for REEs.

[Australia's position]{.underline} in the rare earth's market

[[Australia]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [one of the **richest REEs deposits**
in the world]{.mark}]{.underline} in Mount Weld, Western Australia,
[with high concentrations of neodymium and praseodymium]{.underline}.
These [[two elements are **critical** to]{.mark} the [production]{.mark}
of the most efficient and durable types [of
magnets]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometimes called "supermagnets," which
[help to transform mechanical inputs into electric energy]{.underline}
(wind turbines for example) [and vice-versa]{.underline} (for instance
[in [EVs]{.mark}),]{.underline} as well as for hard-discs [[and medical
devices]{.mark}.]{.underline} While this mining discovery ocurred in the
1970s, mining in Mount Weld did not start until 2011, one year after the
global wake-up call on China's supremacy in REEs. Mount Weld is
currently the only site with largescale mining. Other abundant sites are
currently being explored such as the location at Browns Ragne, also in
Western Australia, which is rich in dysprosium (also needed for
supermagnets), or the Nolans Project near Alice Springs, rich in
neodymium and praseodymium.

[[Australia]{.mark} was [the **third largest producer**]{.mark} of
REEs]{.underline} with 18,000 mt in 2022 [[after
China]{.underline}]{.mark} (210,000 mt) [and the US (]{.underline}43,000
mt), although [it is [considered to be the **fifth largest country** in
REEs]{.mark}]{.underline} [[deposits overall]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}, though being the second largest exporter, [is
considered to [have]{.mark} just roughly [half of Australia's
deposits]{.mark}]{.underline}. Countries like Vietnam, Brazil, Russia,
and India have larger deposits than Australia, but have been unable to
set up largescale mining. This shows how costly and time-consuming it is
to set up mining facilities, not only from a logistical standpoint, but
also in guaranteeing a minimum of environmental safety.

The reason why Australia started mining REEs in 2011 is Japan. Following
its 2010 clash with China, and fearing massive losses in their
electronic and vehicle manufacturing due to lack of REEs supply, [Japan
partnered with the Australian Lynus mining company to finance mining at
Mount Weld]{.underline}, and set up refining in Malaysia, where most of
Australia's raw ore is exported to. Meanwhile, Malaysia, which has the
only refining plant of REEs outside China, has become the top global
exporter of refined REEs which is mainly exported to Japan. The
proactiveness of the Japanese government is an example of supply chain
innovation, illustrating that [sanctions can be effectively counteracted
if there is public willingness]{.underline} to do so. Interestingly,
[Japan found [a useful associate in Australia]{.mark}]{.underline}, even
as most of the product and profit is kept in Japan.

Ms. Naaja H. Nathanielsen (interviewee) is the Minister for Business,

A concern for any U.S. administration is increasing Chinese influence in
Europe and the Arctic. Are Greenlanders worried about China's influence
in the Arctic? What might be the impact on Greenland's security and
society? 

**[[Chinese investments in Greenland are almost
non-existing.]{.underline}]{.mark}** We have [so far]{.mark} seen
[two]{.mark} [Chinese companies invest in the mineral sector]{.mark}.
[One]{.mark} of these mineral licenses [was withdrawn]{.mark} by me
(\[on behalf of\] our government) [[due to lack of
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are currently in a lawsuit with the
company. The [other]{.mark} investment was in the "Kvanefjeld project"
in the southern part of Greenland. This project [cannot move forward
since it [violates our ban on uranium]{.underline}]{.mark}. We do have a
lot of exports to China from the fishing sector. But **[[there is not a
strong Chinese presence in Greenland.]{.underline}]{.mark}** 

[[When marketing the business opportunities in Greenland we primarily
look towards]{.mark} the European Union, Canada and the [U.S]{.mark}.,
all of whom are our allies]{.underline}. We have decade-long
partnerships with the EU, Canada and the U.S. in a number of fields
(business, research, political, military and so on) and in [our recently
published foreign policy strategy we emphasize the importance of
building on existing relationships especially towards the West (The U.S.

[We are very]{.mark} much [aware of the [importance

While there are data that relate local [[reductions in **species

results [[**do not point** to]{.mark} **substantial [existential]{.mark}
[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The data are **small-scale
experiments**]{.underline} in which plant productivity, or nutrient
retention is reduced as species number declines locally (Vellend, 2017),
or are local observations of increased variability in fisheries yield
when stock diversity is lost (Schindler et al., 2010). [Those are **not
existential risks**]{.underline}. [To make the link **even more
tenuous**, [there is]{.mark} **[little ev]{.mark}**idence that
[biod]{.mark}iversity [is **even declining**]{.mark} at **local
scales**]{.underline} (Vellend et al 2017; Vellend et al., 2013). Total
planetary biodiversity may be in decline, but local and [**regional**
biodiversity is often staying the same because [species from elsewhere
**replace local losses**]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit homogenizing the
world in the process. Although the majority of conservation scientists
are likely to flinch at this conclusion, there is growing skepticism
regarding the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss
to an existential risk for humans (Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014).
[Obviously if **all** biodiversity disappeared civilization would
end---but [**no one** is forecasting the loss of **all
species**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It seems plausible that the loss of
[**90%** of the world's species could **also** be apocalyptic, but **not
one** is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss
**either**]{.underline}. Tragic, but [**plausible** is the possibility
our planet suffering a loss of as many as **half of its species**.
[If]{.mark} global [biod]{.mark}iversity [were **halved**]{.mark},
but]{.underline} at the same time [locally the number of species stayed
relatively **stable**, [what would be the mechanism for an
**end-of-civilization**]{.mark}]{.underline} or even end of human
prosperity **[[scenario?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Extinctions and
[**[biod]{.mark}**iversity [**loss** are]{.mark}]{.underline} ethical
and spiritual losses, but perhaps [[not]{.mark} an
**[existential]{.mark} risk.**]{.underline}

What about the remaining eight planetary boundaries? Stratospheric ozone
depletion is one---but thanks to the Montreal Protocol ozone depletion
is being reversed (Hand, 2016). Disruptions of the nitrogen cycle and of
the phosphorous cycle have also been proposed as representing potential
planetary boundaries (one boundary for nitrogen and one boundary for
phosphorous). There are compelling data linking excesses in these
nutrients to environmental damage. For example, over-application of
fertilizer in Midwestern USA has led to dead zones in the Gulf of
Mexico. Similarly, [excessive nitrogen has **polluted
groundwater**]{.underline} in California to such an extent that it is
unsuitable for drinking and some rural communities are forced to drink
bottled water. [However, these impacts are **local**. At the same time
that there is too much N loading in the US, there is a need for more N
in **Africa**]{.underline} as a way of increasing agricultural yields
(Mueller et al., 2012). [While the disruption of **nitrogen** and
**phosphorous cycles**]{.underline} [clearly **perturb** local
ecosystems, **end-of-the-world scenarios** seem a bit
**far-fetched.**]{.underline}

Another hypothesized planetary boundary entails the conversion of
natural habitats to agricultural land. The mechanism by which too much
agricultural land could cause a crisis is unclear---unless it is because
land conversion causes so much biodiversity loss that is species
extinctions that are the proximate cause of an eco-catastrophe.
Excessive [**chemical pollution** and]{.underline} excessive
[atmospheric **aerosol loading** have each been suggested as planetary
boundaries as well]{.underline}. In the case of these pollution
boundaries, there are well-documented mechanisms by which surpassing
some concentration of a pollutant inflicts severe human health hazards.
There is abundant evidence linking chemical and aerosol pollution to
higher mortality and lower reproductive success in humans, which in turn
could cause a major die-off. It is perhaps appropriate then that when
Hollywood envisions an unlivable world, it often invokes a story of
humans poisoning themselves. That said, [it is **doubtful** that we will
**poison ourselves to**]{.underline}wards **[extinction]{.underline}**.
Data show that [[as nations **develop**]{.mark} and **increase their
wealth**, [they]{.mark} tend to [**clean up their air** and **water**
and **reduce**]{.mark} **environmental [pollution]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Flörke et al., 2013; Hao & Wang, 2005). In addition, [as economies
become more **circular**]{.underline} (see Mathews & Tan, 2016),
[environmental damage due to waste products is likely to
**decline**]{.underline}. The key point is that the pollutants
associated with the planetary boundaries are so widely recognized, and
the consequences of local toxic events are so immediate, that [[it is
**reasonable** to expect]{.underline}]{.mark} national [[**governments
to act** before we suffer]{.mark} a **planetary

Can you [explain]{.underline} what **[the mechanism]{.underline}** is
[whereby **biodiversity loss** creates **existential
risk**?]{.underline} And if biodiversity loss is an existential risk,
how big a risk is it? Should 80k be getting people to go into
conservation science or not?

There are independent reasons to think that the risk is negligible.
Firstly, according to wikipedia, [during **the Eocene
period**]{.underline} \~65m years ago, [there were **thousands fewer
genera than today**]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} have [made **\~1%**
of species extinct, and we would [have to continue]{.mark}]{.underline}
at [**[current]{.mark} rates of species [extinctions]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} **at least [200 years]{.mark}** [to return to
**Eocene**]{.mark} **levels of [biod]{.mark}iversity**]{.underline}. And
yet, even though significantly warmer than today, [the Eocene marked the
**dawn** of **thousands of new species**]{.underline}. So, [[**why**
would]{.underline}]{.mark} we expect [[the world]{.mark} **200 years
hence**]{.underline} to [[be **inhospitable**]{.mark} **to humans** [if
it **wasn\'t**]{.mark} **inhospitable** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} all of
the [[species]{.underline}]{.mark} emerging [[in **the Eocene**,
who]{.underline}]{.mark} are/[[were]{.mark} **significantly [less
numerous]{.mark}** [than humans and]{.mark} **significantly [less
capable]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a **[rational response]{.mark} to
problems?**]{.underline}

Secondly, as far as I am aware, evidence for pressure-induced non-linear
ecosystem shifts is very limited. This is true for a range of
ecosystems. Linear ecosystem damage seems to be the norm. If so, this
leaves more scope for learning about the costs of our damage to
ecosystems and correcting any damage we have done.

Thirdly, [ecosystem services are]{.underline} overwhelmingly [a
function]{.underline} of the relations [within **local ecosystems**,
rather than of **global**]{.underline} trends in
**[biodiversity]{.underline}**. Upon discovering Hawaii, the Polynesians
eliminated so many species that global decadal extinction rates would
have been exceptional. This has next to no bearing on ecosystem services
outside Hawaii. [[Humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} is an intelligent
species and [[will be able to]{.mark} see]{.underline} if [other
regions]{.underline} are [suffering from biodiversity loss and **[make
adjustments]{.mark} accordingly**]{.underline}. Why would all regions be
so stupid as to ignore lessons from elsewhere? Also, is biodiversity
actually decreasing in the rich world? I know forest cover is increasing
in many places. Population is set to decline in many rich countries in
the near future, and environmental impact per person is declining on
many metrics.

I also find it surprising that you cite [the **Kareiva and Carranza**
paper]{.underline} in [support]{.underline} of your
[claims]{.underline}, for this paper in fact directly contradicts them:

\"The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity (Ehrlich & Ehrlich, 2012), with the
proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than 0.001% per year
(Rockström et al., 2009). There is little evidence that this particular
0.001% annual loss is a threshold---and it is hard to imagine any data
that would allow one to identify where the threshold was (Brook, Ellis,
Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams, 2013). A better
question is whether one can imagine any scenario by which the loss of
too many species leads to the collapse of societies and environmental
disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute number of
extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

[While]{.underline} there are [data]{.underline} that [relate **local
[reductions]{.mark}** [in species]{.mark}]{.underline} richness [to
altered ecosystem function, these results [**do not** point
to]{.mark}]{.underline} substantial **[[ex]{.mark}istential
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [[data are **small-scale**]{.mark}

[Just over [250 million years ago, the planet
suffered]{.mark}]{.underline} what may be described as its greatest
holocaust: ninety-six percent of marine genera (plural of genus) and
seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for good. Even insects
suffered a mass [[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the only time
before or since. Entire classes of animals -- like trilobites -- went
out like a match in the wind.

But [what's arguably most fascinating about this event -- known as the
Permian-Triassic extinction]{.underline} or more poetically, the Great
Dying -- [is the fact that anything survived at all.
[Life]{.mark}]{.underline}, it seems, [**[is so ridiculously
adaptable]{.mark}** that not only did [thousands of species]{.mark} make
it through whatever killed off nearly everything]{.underline} (no one
knows for certain though theories abound) [but, somehow, after millions
of years life even recovered and [went on to write new
tales]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Even as [[the]{.mark} Permian-Triassic [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}
event shows the fragility of life, it also [[proves its
**resilience**]{.mark} in the long-term]{.underline}. [The lessons of
such mass extinctions -- five to date and arguably a sixth happening as
I write -- inform science today]{.underline}. [Given that extinction
levels are currently 1,000]{.underline} (some even say 10,000[) times
the background rate, researchers have long worried about our current
destruction of biodiversity -- and what that may mean for our future
Earth and ourselves]{.underline}.

In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for
the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an
uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include
climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes,
biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the
terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it "biosphere
integrity," but that hasn't spared it from critique.

A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked
the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

"[[It makes **no sense** that there exists a tipping point of
biod]{.mark}iversity [loss beyond which the Earth will
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}," [[said]{.mark} co-author and ecologist,

Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity
College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world's leading experts
on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.

Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that [[there isn't evidence of a point
at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, **globally** or
even **locally**. If the planet didn't collapse after]{.mark} the
[Permian-Triassic]{.mark} extinction event, **[it won't collapse
now]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- though our descendants may well curse us
for the damage we've done.

Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But
[the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden
plunge.]{.underline} [[Ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
them, [slowly degrade but **[never fail outright.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"[[Of]{.mark} more than [600 experiments]{.mark} of biodiversity effects
on various functions, **[none showed a collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
Montoya said. "In general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect

water quality, plant biomass, and many other important functions as we
lose species. But [we never observe a critical level of biodiversity

[Why [Tipping Points]{.mark} for Biodiversity [Are **Fatally
Flawed**]{.mark} The]{.underline} critical [[global extinction rate
is]{.mark} **operationally [undefined]{.mark}**]{.underline}: when the
heart of the last individual of a species stops beating, global
extinction rate spikes momentarily. Why should this lead to planetary
collapse? Suppose we define the rate ourselves -- for example in terms
of extinctions per million species \[2\] averaged per year or decade.
Following the d[iscovery of the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesians 1500
years ago, they eliminated so many species that even the decadal global
extinction rate would have been exceptional. However, why would these
extinctions of island endemics]{.underline} cause a collapse that
putatively is both global and only now visible? There would certainly be
local consequences of species loss, but why a precipitous local collapse
in ecosystems and why would it be global in extent? Furthermore, how
might the rate of loss (versus its size) be responsible? Certainly,
there are regional physical processes **[for which]{.underline}**
empirical data suggests thresholds. Globally their existence is far from
certain; they do not exist within the terrestrial biosphere in isolation
\[12\]. Models of single populations and local communities can show
thresholds, but these neither deal with extinction rates nor global
processes. Indeed, in publications \[3\], though not in presentationsii,
[[p]{.mark}lanetary [b]{.mark}oundary [arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}
have [[moved **away from catastrophes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, first to
rapid transitions, where small changes lead to large effects, then to
more gradual ones. The concession is 'not all Earth system processes
included in the planetary boundary have singular thresholds at the
global/continental/ocean basin level' \[3\]. Exactly so. This
[[statement admits]{.mark} their **[arbitrary
nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If anything can happen, then there is no
insight gained: gradual change is embraced by entirely arbitrary and
indefinable values where the 'safe operating space' is transgressed.
Drawing attention to global environmental issues is certainly essential,
therefore what harm is there in another approach, superficially
attractive, even if it has limitations? We show that notions of
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**lanetary
**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**oundarie[[s add no
insight]{.underline}]{.mark} into our understanding of the threats to
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, [[have no
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark} to support them, [[are too vague]{.mark}
for use]{.underline} by those who manage biodiversity, [[and promote
**pernicious policies**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Attempts to fix these
problems strip the original idea of all meaningful content, but still
plead for the notion of a safe operating space. Why is this deeply
flawed idea so seductive, and what problems arise from its embrace?

worse, [different researchers using the same satellite data find
plankton **both increasing and decreasing

interesting and important scientific question, but the data we have
available today is clearly unable to answer it. [Before I investigated
this issue, I had seen Boyce, et al. 2010 cited in media reports many

Michael **Slezak 15**, 10-26-2015, \"Ocean's hidden green plankton
revealed by fixing glitch in model,\" New Scientist,
https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28391-demise-of-the-worlds-plankton-has-been-greatly-exaggerated/

[The [rate at which phytoplankton are disappearing]{.mark} as oceans
warm **[has been vastly overestimated by a glitch in models]{.mark}.**
That's good news given that phytoplankton support almost all life in the
oceans and are responsible for half the carbon dioxide removed from the
atmosphere each year -- as well as up to 70 per cent of the oxygen we
breathe.]{.underline} Phytoplankton are single-celled plants and
microbes that live in the ocean and convert light and nutrients into
organic material, which is then fed up through the food chain. A lot of
that carbon is buried after the phytoplankton die and sink to the
seabed. In 2006, Michael Behrenfeld of Oregon State University and his
colleagues concluded that when oceans warm, the amount of phytoplankton
declines. [By [analysing]{.mark} the colour of oceans in [satellite
images]{.mark} -- [with the assumption that green chlorophyll was a
marker of phytoplankton]{.mark} -- the team found that chlorophyll
levels, and therefore phytoplankton numbers, went down whenever the
water warmed.]{.underline} Phytoplankton need light and nutrients, so
their growth is fuelled when nutrient-rich deep water mixes with shallow
water in areas where there is enough light. But as surface water warms,
it becomes more buoyant and mixes less with deeper water, limiting the
phytoplankton's nutrient supply. That was bad news, considering the
oceans are now hotter than ever in the modern record and continue to
warm at a breakneck pace. This is happening as they absorb about 90 per
cent of the excess heat created by our carbon emissions. In 2010,
another study that used images of the ocean and took chlorophyll levels
to be synonymous with phytoplankton abundance concluded that the oceans
had lost 40 per cent of their phytoplankton since the 1950s. Lower
impact [It now seems that this method [exaggerated the impact of warming
on phytoplankton]{.mark} by as much as seven times in some
regions.]{.underline} Reduced mixing caused by warming means that
plankton near the surface become exposed to light for longer, whereas
deeper plankton are less exposed to it. Studies have shown that
phytoplankton acclimatise to changes in light, producing less
chlorophyll when more exposed to it and vice versa. [But [nobody had
built those changes into models]{.mark} used to interpret the satellite
measurements of chlorophyll -- until now. Taking these changes into
account, Behrenfeld's team has now found that in 40 per cent of the
ocean, more than [85 per cent of drops in chlorophyll levels are caused
by]{.mark} acclimatisation to [different light conditions rather
than]{.mark} a [reduction in phytoplankton]{.mark}. **In other words,
[estimates of plankton]{.mark} [death were previously exaggerated more
than sixfold in much of the oceans]{.mark}.** "While the relationship
between phytoplankton \[decline\] and warming is still there, the
[magnitude of]{.mark} the [response is smaller than we thought
earlier]{.mark}," says Behrenfeld.]{.underline}

have been ripped off by refrigerant manufacturers for decades. But it's
not too late to stop the fraud. The Senate is now considering the Kigali

more expensive refrigerants. Although Kigali technically addresses HFCs
for their alleged climatic effects, the entire process is flawed. The

#### Ozone impact [exaggerated]{.underline}.

**Science Daily 2016** ("Ozone does not necessarily promote decline of
natural ecosystems", 2-25,
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160225140040.htm)

[[Environmental scientists]{.mark} at the University of Virginia [have
found that surface ozone]{.mark}]{.underline}, an abundant chemical
known to be toxic to many species of vegetation and to humans, **[[does
not necessarily inhibit the productivity of natural
ecosystems]{.mark}.]{.underline}** \"[This is a rare piece of good news
in the ozone and ecology story]{.underline},\" said Manuel Lerdau, an
ecologist who, along with graduate student Bin Wang, post-doctoral
fellow Jacquelyn Shuman and Professor Hank Shugart, published their
findings this week in the Nature journal Scientific Reports. Though
ozone is essential to the health of the Earth in the upper atmosphere
\-- where it shields the surface from excess ultraviolet radiation \--
the chemical in high concentrations at surface level is hazardous to
human and animal health and to many species of plant life. Ozone becomes
most abundant at the Earth\'s surface during the summertime as plants
grow and produce chemicals, such as isoprene, that react with the
hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide (which comes primarily from
automobiles) to produce ozone. [While it is known that ozone hinders the
growth of many kinds of plants, including crop vegetation, [the extent
to which ozone damaged natural systems was **not well
understood**]{.mark}. The new finding suggests that [unmanaged forests
remain productive as systems because they contain **multiple** tree
**species**]{.mark}, [each with a different sensitivity]{.mark} to
ozone, [and this differential sensitivity]{.mark} to the chemical
[allows the more resistant species to]{.mark} **[compensate]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} [the]{.mark} damages suffered by the [more sensitive
ones]{.mark}. The [researchers]{.mark} used a computer model of forest
growth and production that is well-tested in a variety of ecosystems to
study how species-specific responses to ozone can change the competitive
interactions among species. They [found]{.mark} that [ozone
changes]{.mark} [the relative abundances]{.mark} of tree species, **[but
that overall ecosystem productivity]{.mark}** \-- the rate of biomass
generation \-- a**[nd the ability of the ecosystem to store
carbon]{.mark}** **[do not chang]{.mark}**e in the face of ozone
pollution. [Previous research]{.mark} that [modeled forests broadly but
not species]{.mark}-specifically did not discern these species-specific
compensatory changes.]{.underline}

#### Pollution that destroys the ozone will replace it\-\--solves their impact

**Ring 9** (Meteorologist in New Zealand, 2009, "The Nonsense that is
Ozone Depletion", http://www.ourcivilisation.com/ozone/king.htm)

[There is not a \'layer\' of ozone at all, any more than there is single
layer of air; and [ozone doesn\'t protect us from anything]{.mark}. The
Sun\'s rays hit us at exactlythe same time as they hit the
ozone. Therefore,]{.underline} [[protection is
impossible]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the same way, \'hard\' water
molecules, H3O, doesn\'t prevent anyone from getting wet. [[If we
could]{.mark} snap our fingers and [make every]{.mark} single last
[molecule of ozone disappear, it would have]{.mark} absolutely [no
bearing on]{.mark} the amount of [UV
light]{.mark}]{.underline} reaching the Earth. Now, back to the poles,
where there are indeed observed ozone-depletion zones. How come? Well,
there happens to be two places on Earth where UV light doesn\'t meet
rising warm air molecules: where the Sun shines less and where it is
cold --- at the Poles! Because the Earth is tilted, there is a wide area
of depletion around both poles, and New Zealand happens to be under the
southern depletion zone for much of the winter. In fact the
\"hole\" gets bigger towards spring, because the highs and lows of the
effect are modified by Earth\'s wind systems and subsequently the flow
of warm and cold air. That is why you see glaring headlines on sudden
discoveries about ozone depletion around New Zealand around New
Zealand\'s springtime. But by December the hole is much smaller, and
that\'s when New Zealand has its summer, when the skin cancer risk from
the sun is higher. Bricks Don\'t Float Up Despite all the information
you may have read, there is not one shred of supportable evidence that
CFCs have found their way 40 miles up above the Earth. No one has ever
found any up there because they are roughly five times heavier than air.
They are like a brick in a swimming pool. It is not often that you will
see a brick floating to the surface of your pool. CFCs are so dense that
even as a gas you could fill a bucket with it and pour the contents of
one bucket into another. Secondly there is no evidence that they can
destroy anything because they are very stable and unreactive
substances. Most dictionaries and chemistry books describe them as inert
gases. Faced with this rather unfortunate logic, some researchers extend
the plot, claiming that in the upper atmosphere the intense UV light is
sufficient to break down the CFCs, releasing chlorine which then does
the damage. If that actually could happen though, then [[the \"ozone
layer\" would]{.mark} just [get replaced by the CFC layer, which
would]{.mark} then further \"[protect\" us]{.mark} from UV
radiation.]{.underline} There is, too, another difficulty with the
theory: [the fact that all the CFCs in the world are insufficient to
even dent the known amount of ozone. The factor is 1 in 100,000. So we
get told of yet another scenario --- that in some imagined chain
reaction,]{.underline} [chlorine]{.underline} [would
keep]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [getting released]{.underline} [by
the UV]{.underline} [until all the ozone was destroyed. But
even]{.underline} [if we supposed that this could happen, then all of
these reactions going on]{.underline} [would
only further]{.underline} [absorb UV,]{.underline} [protecting us even
more.]{.underline} [We would]{.underline} [right now]{.underline} [be
dying from lack of UV light and vitamin \"D\"
deficiency.]{.underline} [[There is no evidence]{.mark} that such
a [chain]{.mark} [reaction]{.mark} [would occur]{.mark}. Also, it is a
long jump and unscientific to say that if a reaction could occur, then
it would. Furthermore, there are some 192 known chemical reactions and
48 photochemical reactions occurring in the
stratosphere]{.underline}(the ozone area[) all the time. How would it be
that chlorine and ozone, which are only in minute quantities anyway,
should be able to carry on this reaction to the exclusion of the other
241 known reactive processes? And who says that the \"holes\" are
getting bigger]{.underline}? In 1988 NASA\'s Nimbus satellite appeared
to show that the southern hole was increasing. Here was supposed proof
that man was aggravating the situation. The fact that the following
year\'s results showed the hole smaller than ever previously recorded
went totally unannounced, except in obscure journals. Neither was it
reported that the variation in depletion-area size seemed to correspond
with increases in sunspot activity, which throws out more UV radiation.

**[On track [to full recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The [[UN-backed]{.mark} Scientific Assessment Panel to the Montreal

[report]{.mark}, published every four years, [confirms the phase out of
nearly 99% of banned ozone-depleting]{.mark} [substances]{.mark}. [The
**Montreal Protocol** has thus **succeeded in safeguarding the ozone
layer**]{.mark}, leading to notable recovery of the ozone
layer]{.underline} in the upper stratosphere and decreased human
exposure to harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun.

[[If current policies remain in place, the ozone layer is expected to
recover to 1980 values (before the appearance of the ozone hole) by
around 2066]{.mark} over the Antarctic, by 2045 over the Arctic and by
2040 for the rest of the world. [Variations in the size of the Antarctic
ozone hole, particularly between 2019 and 2021, were driven largely by
meteorological conditions.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, the
Antarctic ozone hole has been slowly improving in area and depth since
the year 2000.

"That ozone recovery is on track according to the latest quadrennial
report is fantastic news. The impact the Montreal Protocol has had on
climate change mitigation cannot be overstressed. Over the last 35
years, the Protocol has become a true champion for the environment,"
said Meg Seki, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Environment
Programme's Ozone Secretariat. "The assessments and reviews undertaken
by the Scientific Assessment Panel remain a vital component of the work
of the Protocol that helps inform policy and decision makers."

The Polar Silk Road (**[[PSR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [was added in

[**Chinese** academic and journalistic reports]{.underline} and
articles, sometimes even [dubbed the]{.underline} "**[Golden

**[However]{.underline}**, it is unclear how significant the PSR is in
China's overall Arctic strategy and foreign policy. [There have been
[conflicting **signals** from Chinese officials]{.mark}]{.underline}
regarding the importance of the PSR.4) While it is seen as an important

The [**[PSR]{.mark}** has [mysteriously disappeared from

In response to Chinese President [**[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping['s call for

[at a **C**hinese **C**ommunist **P**arty]{.underline} (CCP) [Central

meeting in 2014,1) the Chinese Government issued Energy Production and
Consumption Revolution Strategy (2016-2030),2) which [[aims to
promote]{.mark} strategic **[nation-wide]{.mark}** energy
[transition]{.mark}]{.underline} to a green low-carbon energy system.
More recently, at the 76th United Nations General Assembly in September
2021, President Xi further announced two ambitious carbon goals that
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** "[[aims to have]{.mark} **carbon
dioxide**]{.underline} (CO2) [[emissions **peak**]{.mark} before 2030
[and achieve **carbon neutrality**]{.mark} before 2060]{.underline}".3)
These goals have since been incorporated into China's national economic
and social development strategy. For example, the transition to a clean
energy system and the pursuit of low-carbon development are recurring
themes in China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) and the Vision 2035.4)
Despite that, achieving these goals presents a significant challenge to
China, the world's second-largest economy and the largest energy
consumer, with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal.
Therefore, a rapid and comprehensive green energy transition is needed
in China to fulfill these ambitious climate goals. Meanwhile,
[[the]{.mark} **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [an]{.underline}
"[emerging **energy province**]{.underline}",5) has [[attracted
increasing]{.mark} **global [attention]{.mark}**]{.underline} due to its
vast energy potential, particularly in oil and gas, with China showing
considerable interest.

[[Various **studies**]{.mark} have [pinpointed]{.mark} the [strategic
value of **Arctic**]{.mark} oil and gas [for China]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These [[energy reserves]{.underline}]{.mark} can [**[enhance]{.mark}**
China's energy **security** by increasing and diversifying]{.underline}
its energy **[[supply]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [particularly
in]{.underline} the [context of]{.underline} rapidly growing domestic
energy demand and [its heavy **reliance** on]{.underline} energy
**[imports]{.underline}**.6) While acknowledging the strategic value of
Arctic energy resources for China's energy supply, this article argues
that they also have a role in China's energy transition. Specifically,
this study examines [**Arctic l**iquified **n**atural
**g**as]{.underline} (LNG), [**wind** energy]{.underline}, [and
**geothermal** energy in China's **green transition**]{.underline}. This
study reveals different dynamics that each of these three energy sources
plays within China's green transition. Chinese mainstream discourse has
greatly valued importing LNG from the Arctic to promote a domestic green
transition, given its cleaner properties compared to coal and oil. The
role of Arctic wind and geothermal energy development technology and
experience is also recognized in China but less prominently featured in
mainstream discussions. Furthermore, this study highlights that the
tendency to overemphasize the role of Arctic LNG in energy transition
may create a misleading perception of green progress. [Such]{.underline}
a [**tendency** may unintentionally **slow down** the development of
**renewable** energy]{.underline}, [derived from natural sources that
are]{.underline} continuously and [naturally
**replenished**]{.underline}.7) Unlike LNG, these renewable energies
form the genuine foundation for a green energy transition.

Does Arctic LNG help China's green energy transition?

LNG is natural gas converted to a liquid state (around -162 °C) with
certain impurities, such as CO2 and dust, removed. The volume of LNG is
about 600 times smaller than natural gas at standard atmospheric
pressure, which greatly facilitates gas transportation without relying
on pipelines and improves the gas storage capacity.8) More importantly,
compared to other fossil fuels, LNG stands out for its reduced climatic
impact due to its noteworthy carbon emission reduction:9) its use emits
around 40 percent less CO2 than coal and 30 percent less than oil
(specific figures vary among sources).10) In this regard, LNG has been
long perceived as the cleanest fossil fuel,11) or even "clean" and
"green" energy,12) and a reliable back-up for renewable energy,13) or
more bluntly, "a perfect transition fuel" to clean energy production and
"the fuel for change",14) particularly in industries.

[**[China]{.mark}** has heavily [invested in major **Arctic
LNG**]{.mark} projects in the **Russian Arctic**]{.underline}, such as
Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2, both of which are operated by Novatek, a
publicly-traded Russian energy company on paper. China owns substantial
stakes in these two projects. [With **C**hina **N**ational **P**etroleum
**C**orporation]{.underline} (CNPC) [and the **Silk Road
Fund**]{.underline}, Chinese shares account for around 30 percent of
Yamal LNG. This represents the first mega overseas energy project since
the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by the Chinese
Government in 2013.15) It has also been [hailed as the]{.underline}
"**[corner stone]{.underline}**" and "flagship project" [of Sino-Russian
**coop**eration]{.underline} by the leaders of Russia and China.16)
Similarly, with CNPC and China National Offshore Oil Corporation
(CNOOC), China secured a 20 percent share of Arctic LNG 2. [Besides
being a key **shareholder**]{.underline}, [China is also a **crucial
buyer** in Russian **Arctic LNG** projects]{.underline}. For example,
CNPC holds a 20-year contract with Novatek to purchase 3 million tons of
LNG annually, nearly 20 percent of the total production capacity of the
first three factory lines of Yamal LNG.17) Yamal LNG was launched in
late 2017, and China received the first shipment via the Northern Sea
Route in 2018.18) Meanwhile, Arctic LNG 2 is still under construction,
with the opening of the first production line originally scheduled in
December 2023. Although NOVATEK has projected their confidence in
completing the production lines on schedule,19) the original timeline
has been complicated by Western sanctions against Russia following its
invasion of Ukraine. For instance, these [[**sanctions** led to the
**withdrawal** of]{.mark} key **[Western]{.mark}** engineering
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as France's Technip and Italy's
Saipem, from the project. Regardless of the future of Arctic LNG 2,
[**Chinese** energy companies already signed **purchase
agreements**]{.underline} with Novatek for around 40 percent of the
estimated LNG production.20)

Besides guaranteeing domestic energy supply and energy security,
[[China's enthusiasm]{.mark} for **Arctic LNG** projects is also guided
by another **crucial rationale**]{.underline}: Arctic LNG resources [can
[facilitate]{.mark} China's **[energy transition]{.mark}** and help
China achieve its ambitious **carbon goals**]{.underline}. The
[significance]{.underline} of Arctic LNG for China's green energy
transition has been frequently [[**highlighted** by]{.mark} China's
state-run and **[top media channels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as
Xinhua News Agency, China Central Television, People's Daily, Guangming
Daily, and Chinese state-owned major energy enterprises, such as CNPC,
the [largest Chinese **shareholder**]{.underline} in the above-mentioned
[**LNG projects** and]{.underline} the [largest Chinese oil and gas
producer]{.underline} and supplier. For example, before the first
production of Yamal LNG, the project had already been lauded in news
reports by People's Daily for its significance in advancing China's
energy transition, with LNG being described as clean energy fuel.21)
Since the first shipment to China, the role of Yamal LNG in facilitating
China's energy transition has been reiterated by various state-run
influential mass media.22) In a similar vein, the Chairman of CNPC, Wang
Yilin, [highlighted the great **potential** of]{.underline} Yamal LNG in
China's [ongoing **energy transition**]{.underline} during his on-site
visit to the Yamal Peninsula in July 2017.23) A public statement by CNPC
further pointed out that Yamal LNG and [**Arctic LNG 2** are joint
pillars of China's **P**olar **S**ilk **R**oad]{.underline}, whose
production can "further enrich the sources of China's clean energy
supply and accelerate the adjustment of China's energy structure".24)

Despite occasional concerns in China about the genuine purity of LNG,25)
the prevailing discourse within the country suggests Arctic LNG could
play a vital role in China's green transition. However, it is important
to recognize that LNG still has an environmental footprint.26) As
highlighted by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), LNG is not
"as climate-friendly as once thought",27) mostly due to its substantial
methane emissions during the upstream and regasification stages.28)
Despite the far shorter atmospheric lifespan of its emissions (fading
away in a decade on average while CO2 can last for centuries), methane
is the second most important greenhouse gas (GHG) contributor to climate
change29) and has about 80 times more warming power than CO2 over the
short term.30) Furthermore, the development of Arctic LNG projects
carries additional climate risks, given that the upstream stage occurs
in the environmentally vulnerable Arctic. When Arctic LNG tankers arrive
in China, the transported LNG must be converted back to its gaseous
state through the regasification process, a stage in which both direct
and indirect methane emissions may occur. This situation may pose a
challenge to China's broader efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the near
term and adds a complex layer of the country's climate change mitigation
and green energy transition strategy, particularly given the methane's
significant short-term warming effect.

Overall, since natural gas is a cleaner alternative compared to
'dirtier' fossil fuels such as coal, Arctic LNG may have a role to play
in China's green transition. However, it is essential to recognize the
inherent fossil fuel nature of LNG, along with the significant methane
emissions. Therefore, it is important not to overemphasise the Arctic
LNG's role in China's green transition in influential domestic
discourses. Exaggerating its role may lead to misperception and hinder
the fundamental efforts to achieve China's ambitious climate goals,
particularly given the considerable methane leaks during regasification
in China and methane's potent heat-trapping power in the near term.
Additionally, China's strong interest in Arctic LNG may not benefit its
image as a responsible Arctic stakeholder when taking the substantial
methane emissions during extracting and processing LNG in the
environmentally sensitive Arctic into account. In short, stakeholders in
China's green transition would be wise to approach Arctic LNG with
caution as a potential transition fuel, prioritising sustainable and
renewable energy sources in China's energy mix, rather than
over-emphasizing the role of Arctic LNG.

What about [Arctic **renewables**]{.underline}?

China's first-ever Arctic Policy in 2018 alluded to the "abundance of
geothermal, wind, and other clean energy resources" in the Arctic and
highlighted that China "will work with the Arctic States to strengthen
clean energy cooperation, increase exchanges in respect of technology,
personnel and experience in this field, explore the supply of clean
energy and energy substitution, and pursue low-carbon development".31)
While it remains unknown exactly what "other clean energy resources"
include and whether LNG is a part of them, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}
appears to be [[interested in Arctic **geothermal** and **wind**
energy]{.mark} for international cooperation]{.underline} in clean
energy. Different from that LNG being shipped from the Arctic to China,
[**cooperation** on geothermal power and wind power is mostly about
**tech**nology]{.underline}, personnel and experience exchange, as
[indicated in China's **Arctic Policy**]{.underline}.

Wind power technology from the European Arctic States

**[[Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one of the Arctic states,
[[pioneered **wind**]{.mark} **energy** and remains a **world
leader**]{.underline} in the industry. Back in 2005, the Danish
Government and the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC) [launched the **W**ind **E**nergy **D**evelopment]{.underline}
(WED) Program [to [help China improve]{.mark} its **wind power**
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} development in general and help Chinese
local authorities tailor wind energy development plans.32) Since then,
Denmark has played a key role in assisting China with its rapid wind
power development. One example is that the Danish Energy Technology
Development and Demonstration Programme (EUDP) and the Chinese Ministry
of Science and Technology (MoST) started a new cooperation project in
2014, particularly focusing on "determining how Chinese wind turbines
situated in mountainous regions can best be exploited".33) Wind power
cooperation between China and the Arctic states is not limited to
Sino-Danish cooperation. The Nordic region has rich wind resources due
to its geographical location. The Nordic countries have generally
developed advanced wind power technology to cost-effectively generate,
store, and distribute wind energy. China has been cooperating with these
European Arctic states on wind energy development to varying degrees.
For instance, China and Norway have been cooperating on offshore wind
energy since 2010,34) with Norway holding advanced offshore wind energy
technology and expertise. A [**[M]{.mark}**emorandum **[o]{.mark}**f
**[U]{.mark}**nderstanding]{.underline} (MoU) [[on **Sino-Norwegian**
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the wind power sector signed between
Innovation Norway and the Chinese Wind Energy Association in 2019
[[further promoted **bilateral coop**]{.mark}eration in the **wind
energy** industry]{.underline}, [particularly [in]{.mark} the
**[offshore wind]{.mark}** energy sector]{.underline}, according to Knut
R. Sørlie, the then Commercial Counsellor at Royal Norwegian Embassy in
Beijing and the Head of Innovation Norway in China.35)

[**[China]{.mark}** experienced a **tremendous
dev**elopment]{.underline} in wind energy over the past decade,
exemplified by its [**[emerge]{.mark}**nce [as]{.mark} the world's
[largest **manufacturing** base for **wind power**]{.mark}]{.underline}
equipment and a four-fold increase in installed wind power capacity from
2012 and 2022.36) Wind power accounted for more than 6 percent of
China's total electricity consumption in 2020, and this figureincreased
to approximately 8 percent in 2021, with these percentages calculated by
the author based on the data from the Chinese National Energy Agency
(NEA). It is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the exact impact of
cooperation with the pioneering Nordic wind power industry on China's
rapid and promising wind power development. Nevertheless, the European
Arctic countries' technological know-how and expertise have undeniably
been instrumental in advancing the Chinese wind energy industry, and the
sector's rapid and steady growth could contribute to China's progress
towards its green goals.37)

Geothermal energy technology from Iceland

[**[Iceland]{.mark}** is the world [lead]{.mark}er [in]{.mark} **green
transition** and]{.underline} the utilisation of [[**geothermal**
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to the Icelandic Government's
Energy Policy to the year 2050 published in 2020,38) geothermal and
hydropower had accounted for 100 percent of the nation's energy supply
of electricity and heating. Besides its original use in bathing and
washing, geothermal energy has been predominantly used for space heating
and electricity generation in Iceland.39) The export of Icelandic
know-how and success in utilizing geothermal energy to China began in
the 1980s. [**Sino-Icelandic** cooperation]{.underline} in geothermal
energy utilization [has deepened since Arctic Green Energy
Corporation]{.underline} in Iceland and China Petroleum & Chemical
Corporation's Star Petroleum (**[[Sinopec
Star]{.underline}]{.mark}**)40) [[co-funded]{.underline}]{.mark} Sinopec
**[Green Energy]{.underline}** Geothermal [Development
Corporation]{.underline} in 2006.41) This joint venture company became
"the world's largest geothermal district heating company with 160 heat
centrals across 20 cities/counties in China"42) in ten years and has
been set as one of the first "Geothermal Utilization Demonstration
Units" by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the NEA in China.43)
Moreover, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the
Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Iceland signed an
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on establishing a [**Sino-Icelandic**
Geothermal **R**esearch and **D**evelopment]{.underline} (R&D) Center in
2015, and this R&D Center was successfully set up one year later.44)
[Building on this **collaboration**]{.underline}, the two countries
signed another MoU in 2018 to [establish]{.underline} a geothermal
working group, providing "[new platforms for **bilateral
coop**eration]{.underline}".45)

[[China is home to **abundant**]{.mark} geothermal
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, accounting for 7.9 percent of the
world's total resources, with the majority located in the populated and
economically prosperous eastern region with the highest energy demand
within the country.46) Chinese geothermal energy reserves [are
[primarily mid]{.mark}- to low-[temp]{.mark}erature]{.underline},
[[making them]{.mark} more [**suitable** for]{.mark} space heating in
[winter]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[a role **traditionally filled** by
**coal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, this does not imply that
mid-/low-temperature geothermal energy cannot be harnessed for
electricity generation. China also possesses high-temperature geothermal
resources that are more suitable for electricity generation, mainly
distributed in Tibet, Yunnan and Sichuan.47) Moreover, the Chinese
Government clearly recognizes the important role of geothermal energy in
achieving green energy transition. Promoting the development and
utilization of geothermal energy has been one key goal in China's 13th
and 14th Five-Year Plans for Renewable Energy Development. Specifically,
the latest 14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy Development
(2021-2025) encouraged the local authorities to actively promote
large-scale geothermal energy development, including comprehensively
developing geothermal energy for district heating and gradually
promoting the development of geothermal power generation.48) According
to the Sinopec Green Energy Geothermal Development Corporation, their
efforts in geothermal energy have replaced 5.92 million tons of coal,
thereby reducing CO2 emissions by 11.25 million tons.49) Nevertheless,
[[despite **China**'s]{.mark} significant reserves of
**[geothermal]{.mark}** energy]{.underline} and considerable progress in
this sector, [**[tech]{.mark}**nological [challenges have
hindered]{.mark}]{.underline} the larger-scale and higher-quality
[**[dev]{.mark}**elopment]{.underline} and utilization of these
resources.50) To address the challenges, the [well-established
**Sino-Icelandic** [cooperation]{.mark} on **geothermal**
energy]{.underline} is playing and [will [continue to play a **key
role**]{.mark} through]{.underline} the [joint venture **geothermal**
energy company]{.underline}, the R&D center, the dedicated geothermal
working group, and potentially additional cooperation mechanisms in the
future.

Energy Exposure

[[To **power**]{.mark} modern **[civilization]{.mark}** by conventional
means **[consumes]{.mark}** around 7.5 **[billion]{.mark}** tonne[s of
**coal**]{.mark}]{.underline}, 4.5 billion tonnes of petroleum, and 4
billion tonnes of gas every year.35 [This [vast **output**]{.mark} of
fossil **energy** is one of [the **largest**]{.mark} human [**chemical
impacts** on]{.mark} the **[Planet]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- and does
not come without grave cost.

[Contaminants]{.underline} commonly [found in [**coal**
include]{.mark}]{.underline} mercury, cadmium, radioactive elements,
[**[sulphur]{.mark}** and nitrogen compounds]{.underline}, volatile
organic carcinogens [and other **[toxins]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
carbon released when coal is burned is the major driver of global
climate change. The [**mining** and **burning** of coal also [cause
**acid runoff** and]{.mark} **acid [rain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which
damage rivers and forests [and are **[chiefly]{.mark}** responsible for
[**acidifying** the]{.mark} world's **[oceans]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By
volume, the mining, burning and processing of coal constitutes the
[**[largest]{.mark} source** of [**toxicity** from any]{.mark} human
[activity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Coal combustion, for instance, releases
about 8100 tonnes of highly poisonous mercury into the Earth system
every year. This [[accumulates]{.mark} **year** after **year**,
[affecting]{.mark} the **[food]{.mark} chain**]{.underline}, such as in
long-lived fish. Likewise, petroleum contains many substances, such as
benzene, that are toxic or may cause cancer.

The burning of all fossil fuels -- coal, oil, gas, tar sands etc. --
poses multiple threats to human health, especially for developing
children and unborn babies.36 It releases a range of poisons into the
environment including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), mercury, [[**sulphur** dioxide]{.underline}]{.mark},
nitrogen oxides [and]{.underline} microscopic particles of [[black
**carbon**]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[impair]{.mark} air quality,
**[water]{.mark}** and **food**]{.underline}. The direct impacts of
these on health, especially of infants and children, include lung
disease, asthma, developmental and sexual disorders, brain disease and
cancers. Furthermore, the burning of fossil fuels releases 37 billion
tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year, driving climate change,
which in turn [[causes]{.mark} malnutrition, **heat stress**, infectious
**[disease]{.mark}**]{.underline} and mental problems. All of these
interact with the direct effects of poisoning to make them worse.

In the world's first endeavour to quantify the costs of air pollution
alone, the Centre for Research into Clean Energy and Air (CRCEA) put it
at \$2.9 trillion in 2018 (Figure 1.2), equal to around 3.3 per cent of
world economic turnover.37 Air pollution also killed around 8 million
people from lung disease, heart disease, stroke and cancer, and caused
the loss of 1.8 billion days of work, 4 million new cases of child
asthma and 2 million premature births.38

This, however, is by no means the full toll of fossil fuels, which also
includes industrial workers poisoned, the toxic emissions from plastics,
packaging, furnishings, paints, cleaning agents and solvents, creating
indoor air pollution in homes and workplaces which is often worse than
the city air outside. It includes pesticides and microplastics in the
home and food chain, the side-effects of drugs both illegal and legal, a
flood of 'gender bender' substances and nerve poisons. In short, the
fossil fuels industry, while powering society, is also the primary
source of most of the poisoning of people and life on Earth.

In October 2017, The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Public Health
concluded:

> Pollution is the [**largest** environmental cause of
> **disease**]{.underline} and premature death [in the **world**
> today]{.underline}. Diseases caused by pollution were responsible for
> an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015---16% of all deaths
> worldwide---three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and
> malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms
> of violence. In the most severely affected countries,
> pollution-related disease is responsible for more than one death in
> four.39

The fossil fuels industry, for all its convenience and many economic,
social and even health benefits, is thus implicated in [the
**[worst]{.mark} case** of mass [**homicide** in]{.mark} human
**[history]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- an annual death toll far greater
than that of either of the World Wars.

TOKYO \-- [[**China** can drive global **climate negotiations**]{.mark}
as the U.S. backtracks]{.underline} from its engagements,
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} the [chief negotiator for
**[Azerbaijan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which
hosted]{.mark}]{.underline} the [most [recent **COP29**
talks]{.mark}]{.underline}, [citing Beijing\'s **significant role** in
bringing developing nations together]{.underline} at the conference.

The [world\'s **second-largest** economy can be]{.underline} \"[a
**rep**resentative of the **Global South**]{.underline} and developing
countries\" in future climate talks, Yalchin Rafiyev, who is also
Azerbaijan\'s deputy foreign minister, told Nikkei Asia.

Rafiyev said [[China was]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"**[[constructive]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [at **COP29**]{.underline},
held in Baku, [where nations]{.underline} spent hours and hours
[negotiating]{.underline} over [how much funding **developed nations**
would provide]{.underline} for the financing needed for poorer nations
to tackle climate change.

They [eventually [agreed that **wealthy nations** would]{.mark} offer
[\$300 billion per year]{.mark} in climate funding]{.underline} to
developing ones, and work to scale that up to \$1.3 trillion per year by
2035 from all public and private sources.

\"[**China** [mobilized]{.mark}]{.underline} many other [developing
countries to agree on the **[final deal]{.mark}**]{.underline},\"
Rafiyev said. \"We [[had]{.mark} a very **[constructive
coop]{.mark}**eration between]{.underline} our [presidency]{.underline}
and China, who helped us a lot.\" He said that shows \"China has the
potential to play a global role.\"

The assessment comes at a time when global climate talks are at a
turning point, given the withdrawal of the U.S., the world\'s second
largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, from engagements.

President Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a climate change
**skeptic**]{.underline}, on his first day in office [[pulled]{.mark}
the country [out of the **Paris**]{.mark} Agreement]{.underline}, which
aims to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees
Celsius and ideally to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Trump
had taken the same action during his first term in office, a move later
reversed by his successor as president Joe Biden.

The **[U.S.]{.underline}** has [also [quit the board of the **U.N.
climate damage fund**]{.mark}]{.underline}, intended to help poorer
nations cope with climate change-related disasters.

\[Figure Omitted\]

The U.S. moves, [observers say]{.underline}, [have **[dampened]{.mark}**
the [global impetus for tackling **climate
change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Major oil and gas [companies]{.mark} are
now [stepping back from]{.mark}]{.underline} their ambitious
[[renewable]{.mark} **energy dev**elopment]{.underline} targets
[[and]{.mark} [refocusing on **fossil**]{.mark}]{.underline} fuels,
while global banks have quit the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Banking Alliance
in droves.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, has continued to build coal
power plants, but [its [share of global clean energy
**investment**]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[has [risen from a
**quarter**]{.mark}]{.underline} ten years ago [[to]{.mark} almost
**[one-third]{.mark}**]{.underline} today,\" according to the

China [is]{.underline} \"[[playing an **important**
role]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [[in]{.mark} the [global efforts]{.mark} to
**decarbonize**]{.underline}, Rafiyev said, another factor that makes
China likely to take a leading role in climate talks.

[**China** installed a record **293 g**iga**w**atts]{.underline} (GW)
[of wind and solar]{.underline} in 2023 -- [pushing its **total
capacity**]{.underline} to 1,050GW, according to a new report.

The report, [published by **Australia-based** thinktank]{.underline}
Climate Energy Finance, says that, [if this rate of **renewables**
growth is maintained]{.underline}, then [**China** could reach
its]{.underline} "dual carbon" [**climate goals** earlier than
planned]{.underline}.

Here, Carbon Brief interviews the author of the report, Xuyang Dong. The
questions and Dong's answers are reproduced in full, below.

(An abridged version of this interview was published in the 16 May
edition of China Briefing, Carbon Brief's fortnightly email newsletter
focusing on climate and energy developments relating to China. Sign up
for free.)

Carbon Brief: Your report concluded that China's coal power output will
soon peak and decline -- despite rising coal capacity -- thanks to the
rapid rise of clean energy sources. How widely do you think that
potential tipping point is understood, both within China and
internationally?

Xuyang Dong: This potential is not being understood or acknowledged
enough both within China and internationally. China is prioritising
energy security over the need to reduce coal-use. It has positioned
thermal power as the backup energy source to ensure energy security, as
electricity demand continues to grow and boost the economy. This
strategy is being emphasised after the downturn in hydropower generation
last year caused by droughts, as well as blackouts in different parts of
the country due to the unmet rising electricity demand. I think there is
a pressure domestically of not wanting to admit it, as they really want
to ensure energy security first. Concurrently, China is increasing
renewable energy capacity at a staggering pace that far outstrips every
other nation on the planet.

Internationally, news headlines continue to emphasise that China is
building new coal-fired power plants, leading to a lack of confidence
about China's commitment to decarbonising its national electricity grid,
although the expansion in renewable energy additions in China is at an
unprecedented speed and scale.

However, the picture is more positive when we look at installed
capacity. At the end of March this year, 53% of China's installed
capacity is zero-emissions. This paves the way for China to reduce its
reliance on coal and to do so rapidly -- as we map in our report. China
now needs to be more ambitious in its climate targets and it is well
positioned to do so.

CB: If China is to announce more ambitious climate goals and expand
renewable energy like you suggested in the report, in your opinion, what
are the barriers?

XD: We are aware there are concerns over China's land-use as a major
constraint for building more wind and solar farms. We have run a case
study on a 1.5 gigawatt (GW) solar project being built in the Tengger
Desert in Ningxia province. The project has 3.5m solar modules installed
and only took up 0.1% of the total desert. In our model, we estimate
that China needs to install a total of 5,405GW of new solar capacity to
reach its dual-carbon targets and that may require only 11% of a total
land area of the Gobi Desert, a neighbouring desert to Tengger.

The real challenge is that more transmission lines are needed. China
recently started construction of an ultra-high-voltage power line
project, which will cover three provinces -- Shaanxi, Hubei and Anhui --
to send 36 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity to Anhui per annum and
help boost renewable energy consumption by more than 18TWh per annum.
More transmission lines like this are needed to maximise the renewable
energy generation potential of China's desert areas and to resolve
China's land use constraints in the east coast

CB: What do you think about policy support?

XD: I think being more ambitious in the overall climate target would be
a good start because China has the capacity, the money and the
technology to deploy the renewable energy at the speed and scale it
requires.

Considering its political system is "top-down", a more ambitious target
could help the central government to give out more mandates, build
better transmission lines and distribute the generated power into the
areas that are needed.

Internationally, China needs to align with other developed countries to
take its responsibilities as the leading renewable superpower and the
carbon price would be an important policy lever. The external incentives
and penalties, such as \[having a Chinese version of\] the EU's carbon
border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), would also help. CBAM encourages the
EU's trading partners, especially China, to reduce the emissions of
their exports. A further driver would be for other nations to also catch
up with China's staggering renewable expansion and start to emulate its
speed and scale, so there will be no excuse left for China to do less.

CB: Speaking of CBAM, your report recommended China to have one of its
own. Can you explain how introducing one would help, politically, to
enable greater ambition from China's leaders?

XD: Having one itself could incentivise China to increase the price of
carbon, which currently is significantly lower than the EU and the rest
of the developed world, although there is a deflation in China and most
of the commodities are a lot lower than the rest of the world. But a
higher price on carbon could be a good incentive, especially limiting
the emission in the manufacturing industry. It could also match China's
carbon price with the EU and lead to less trade barriers. For other
trading partners, for example, Australia. Australia has been exporting
raw materials. It could also incentivise Australia to do an embedded
decarbonisation on its exports as well.

CB: Wouldn't you worry the CBAM would make trading with some countries,
such as developing countries, harder with China?

XD: The Chinese CBAM could list different categories and for different
countries. It can have a higher standard for the developed countries and
encourage the developed world to help the emerging market and developing
economy to decarbonise. In the Asia-Pacific region, China, Japan, South
Korea and Australia could work together to decarbonise.

CB: In the future you described, what role do you think solar and wind
energy will play?

XD: As our report mapped out, wind and solar will be the leading energy
sources in the future. China's manufacturing capacity is driving down
the cost for solar panels, modules and wind turbines. The cost of
deploying them is lower, too. In the meantime, they have the world's
leading technology, which can increase the utilisation rates. However,
it needs to be accompanied by a better sort of combination in the energy
storage system, and better energy storage, so the renewable energy it
generates doesn't go to waste and it can also help with China's entire
curtailment issues.

CB: What do you think about the current energy storage situation in
China?

XD: It has become a priority compared to a year ago. Most of the policy
before is supporting more build out for solar and wind power projects,
progressively, and now we can see more documents focusing on storage
systems. In fact, there is more and more manufacturing capacity for
batteries as well, so we can see a dropping price in the batteries,
which will be beneficial for a larger deployment of energy storage
systems.

CB: Speaking of solar and battery, what do you think about China's "new
three" -- solar, batteries and EV -- and how they help China in energy
transition and economy?

XD: The "new three" has played a very huge part in China's economic
growth. In 2023, 40% of China's total 5.2% GDP growth last year was
driven by it. \[Read more on Carbon Brief's analysis on clean energy and
China's economic growth in 2023\]. This is very significant, especially
because China is facing multiple headwinds in different areas, including
the housing sector, population decline and deflation.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the first quarter of
2024 saw China sell nearly 1.9m electric cars, more than the rest of the
world combined. I think it's inevitable that China's solar manufacturing
overcapacity continues to lead the global renewable market. China's
solar manufacturing overcapacity has been a big topic and it is posing a
threat to the industry as it is resulting in price slump for the solar
panels and making a lot of business non-profitable. However, there are
still some major players remaining financially healthy.

I know there are a lot of concerns about this overcapacity in the
industry, such as in the EU and the US, and I think for China to address
the concerns over industrial overcapacity, it needs to, first, stimulate
domestic demand and deployment of solar and windfarms, energy storage
systems buildout and EV sales. Secondly, China could use its cheap
renewable exports to help emerging markets and developing economies to
build more renewable energy capacity, boosting and accelerating the
global energy transition. Finally, it should be collaborating on joint
ventures with European and US investors to build local factories.

CB: You mentioned there are some "financially healthy" Chinese companies
and they have often been accused of using state subsidies to win
"unfair" competition. What's your view on the accusations?

XD: It's a very classic way of the Chinese government doing things. When
they see an opportunity, they build the capacity first and they will
even run at a loss-making state to just dominate the market. Once they
have taken over the market, they can profit from that. China has shown
this sort of a pattern of doing business in the past.

However, in the meantime, China has shown it has the labour capacity,
resources and the capital to deploy or develop the manufacturing
capacity at this rate. It drives down the prices of a solar panel and
module, wind turbine, as well as battery and EV prices, so I think it is
good news to the global energy transition overall, especially for
countries from the emerging market and developing economies when they
really need more capital and more cost-efficient materials for them. So
I guess it really depends on how you look at it and how you work with
China instead of working against it.

report. China now needs to be more ambitious in its climate targets and
it is well positioned to do so.

CB: If China is to announce more ambitious climate goals and expand
renewable energy like you suggested in the report, in your opinion, what
are the barriers?

XD: [We are aware there are concerns over China's land-use as a major
constraint for building more wind and solar farms.]{.underline} We have
run a case study on a 1.5 gigawatt (GW) solar project being built in the
Tengger Desert in Ningxia province. The project has 3.5m solar modules
installed and only took up 0.1% of the total desert. In our model, we
estimate that China needs to install a total of 5,405GW of new solar
capacity to reach its dual-carbon targets and that may require only 11%
of a total land area of the Gobi Desert, a neighbouring desert to
Tengger.

The real challenge is that more transmission lines are needed. China
recently started construction of an ultra-high-voltage power line
project, which will cover three provinces -- Shaanxi, Hubei and Anhui --
to send 36 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity to Anhui per annum and
help boost renewable energy consumption by more than 18TWh per annum.
More transmission lines like this are needed to maximise the renewable
energy generation potential of China's desert areas and to resolve
China's land use constraints in the east coast

CB: What do you think about policy support?

XD: I think being more ambitious in the overall climate target would be
a good start because China has the capacity, the money and the
technology to deploy the renewable energy at the speed and scale it
requires.

Considering its political system is "top-down", a more ambitious target
could help the central government to give out more mandates, build
better transmission lines and distribute the generated power into the
areas that are needed.

Internationally, China needs to align with other developed countries to
take its responsibilities as the leading renewable superpower and the
carbon price would be an important policy lever. The external incentives
and penalties, such as \[having a Chinese version of\] the EU's carbon
border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), would also help. CBAM encourages the
EU's trading partners, especially China, to reduce the emissions of
their exports. A further driver would be for other nations to also catch
up with China's staggering renewable expansion and start to emulate its
speed and scale, so there will be no excuse left for China to do less.

CB: Speaking of CBAM, your report recommended China to have one of its
own. Can you explain how introducing one would help, politically, to
enable greater ambition from China's leaders?

XD: Having one itself could incentivise China to increase the price of
carbon, which currently is significantly lower than the EU and the rest
of the developed world, although there is a deflation in China and most
of the commodities are a lot lower than the rest of the world. But a
higher price on carbon could be a good incentive, especially limiting
the emission in the manufacturing industry. It could also match China's
carbon price with the EU and lead to less trade barriers. For other
trading partners, for example, Australia. Australia has been exporting
raw materials. It could also incentivise Australia to do an embedded
decarbonisation on its exports as well.

CB: Wouldn't you worry the CBAM would make trading with some countries,
such as developing countries, harder with China?

XD: The Chinese CBAM could list different categories and for different
countries. It can have a higher standard for the developed countries and
encourage the developed world to help the emerging market and developing
economy to decarbonise. In the Asia-Pacific region, China, Japan, South
Korea and Australia could work together to decarbonise.

CB: In the future you described, what role do you think solar and wind
energy will play?

XD: As our report mapped out, wind and solar will be the leading energy
sources in the future. China's manufacturing capacity is driving down
the cost for solar panels, modules and wind turbines. The cost of
deploying them is lower, too. In the meantime, they have the world's
leading technology, which can increase the utilisation rates. However,
it needs to be accompanied by a better sort of combination in the energy
storage system, and better energy storage, so the renewable energy it
generates doesn't go to waste and it can also help with China's entire
curtailment issues.

CB: What do you think about the current energy storage situation in
China?

XD: It has become a priority compared to a year ago. Most of the policy
before is supporting more build out for solar and wind power projects,
progressively, and now we can see more documents focusing on storage
systems. In fact, there is more and more manufacturing capacity for
batteries as well, so we can see a dropping price in the batteries,
which will be beneficial for a larger deployment of energy storage
systems.

CB: Speaking of solar and battery, what do you think about China's "new
three" -- solar, batteries and EV -- and how they help China in energy
transition and economy?

XD: The "new three" has played a very huge part in China's economic
growth. In 2023, 40% of China's total 5.2% GDP growth last year was
driven by it. \[Read more on Carbon Brief's analysis on clean energy and
China's economic growth in 2023\]. This is very significant, especially
because China is facing multiple headwinds in different areas, including
the housing sector, population decline and deflation.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the first quarter of
2024 saw China sell nearly 1.9m electric cars, more than the rest of the
world combined. I think it's inevitable that China's solar manufacturing
overcapacity continues to lead the global renewable market. China's
solar manufacturing overcapacity has been a big topic and it is posing a
threat to the industry as it is resulting in price slump for the solar
panels and making a lot of business non-profitable. However, there are
still some major players remaining financially healthy.

I know there are a lot of concerns about this overcapacity in the
industry, such as in the EU and the US, and I think for China to address
the concerns over industrial overcapacity, it needs to, first, stimulate
domestic demand and deployment of solar and windfarms, energy storage
systems buildout and EV sales. Secondly, China could use its cheap
renewable exports to help emerging markets and developing economies to
build more renewable energy capacity, boosting and accelerating the
global energy transition. Finally, it should be collaborating on joint
ventures with European and US investors to build local factories.

CB: You mentioned there are some "financially healthy" Chinese companies
and they have often been accused of using state subsidies to win
"unfair" competition. What's your view on the accusations?

XD: It's a very classic way of the Chinese government doing things. When
they see an opportunity, they build the capacity first and they will
even run at a loss-making state to just dominate the market. Once they
have taken over the market, they can profit from that. China has shown
this sort of a pattern of doing business in the past.

However, in the meantime, China has shown it has the labour capacity,
resources and the capital to deploy or develop the manufacturing
capacity at this rate. It drives down the prices of a solar panel and
module, wind turbine, as well as battery and EV prices, so I think it is
good news to the global energy transition overall, especially for
countries from the emerging market and developing economies when they
really need more capital and more cost-efficient materials for them. So
I guess it really depends on how you look at it and how you work with
China instead of working against it.

https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/04/us-europe-divorce-unlikelyabsent-new-crisis/404223/

Growing [concerns about]{.underline} the [**U.S. relationship with NATO
allies**---fueled by]{.underline} Donald [Trump's]{.underline} overtures
to Russia and [attacks on]{.underline} Ukraine and
**[Denmark]{.underline}**---have [spurred European officials
to]{.underline} biweekly [meetings about replacing American defense
goods]{.underline}, according to a European diplomat with knowledge of
the discussions. [But]{.underline} those increasingly intense
[discussions have highlighted]{.underline} that [it **wouldn\'t be easy,
fast, or cheap**]{.underline}.

"Nobody actually wants to be autonomous. [They **all** want to
keep]{.underline} the [ties with the Americans. **Always have and always
will**]{.underline}," the diplomat said.

French president Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} described the urgency of
the situation in March: "[I want to believe]{.underline} that [the
United States will remain at our side]{.underline}. But we must be ready
if that is not the case."

No U.S. representatives have participated in the meetings thus far,
according to the diplomat. But the [engagements are helping to flesh out
details for **increased cooperation**]{.underline}---such as which
nations can produce which arms---[and have led to]{.underline} four
higher-level [meetings between European leaders about joint weapons
development]{.underline}, support for Ukraine, and other "big-picture"
questions, the diplomat said.

In March, the EU published a 22-page white paper on closing capability
gaps. The plan, agreed to by European Union members, includes a joint
commitment to spend 800 billion euro by 2030 on joint defense
capabilities via a 150-billion-euro loan instrument, debt sold on
capital markets, and other vehicles.

[Big increases in **European defense spending** align with what Trump
has been **urging**]{.underline} since his first administration: more
European spending on defense. It's an idea NATO leaders have also been
championing as vital to the strength of the alliance, and something many
Eastern European countries have long called for.

Former President Joe Biden's national security team saw bigger European
defense budgets as a win for U.S. defense manufacturers, since European
countries supporting Ukraine would need to purchase at least some
equipment from U.S. defense firms---and that support would not come at
the expense of U.S. taxpayers. A plan to continue support for Ukraine
with vital U.S. weapons that took shape in the final weeks of the last
administration was conceived as a way to give Trump an easy political
win and continue to support the country fending off invasion. But the
Oval Office spectacle with Ukraine's president in February, combined
with recent White House rhetoric on Denmark, and the decision to briefly
halt U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine, have fractured European
leaders' trust in American leadership, the diplomat said: "Those have
absolutely been turning points."

The fracturing relationship has also weakened the allure of U.S. defense
goods, as other nations worry that the White House, or individual
defense contractors like Elon Musk, can change military outcomes based
on personal political or financial incentives, the diplomat said. "What
if there\'s a conflict in Europe and the same happens but for France,
Germany, Denmark, or Norway? 'Hey guys, if you don\'t make a deal,
there\'s no more spare parts for your F-35s or no more ammo for Patriot
\[missile batteries?\]' Unreliability or unpredictability is not just
poison for NATO. It\'s also poison for industry."

[While European leaders are]{.underline} increasingly [**wary** of
Trump, they **don't actually want to cut the United States out**. The
preference is **still very much for collaboration**, Estonian Prime
Minister]{.underline} Kristen Michal [told Defense One in an
email]{.underline}.

"[Trade between the EU and the U.S. has more than **doubled** over the
past decade. The European Union is a reliable source of critical
supplies to the United States]{.underline}, while being the largest
buyer of the United States' natural gas and oil. [Millions of jobs in
the U.S. depend on the EU]{.underline}," he said. "The
[entire]{.underline} free [world benefits from]{.underline} the
[cooperation between the EU and the USA. **No one wins** in a trade
war]{.underline} or by ignoring each other\'s interests, especially in
defence. The United States is the EU\'s largest export partner and
second-largest import partner."

An [Eastern European defense official]{.underline} emphasized this point
as well, signaling support for the "Trumpian" notion of larger EU
defense budgets and greater European defense independence. But they also
[expressed]{.underline} a [longing for a better partnership
with]{.underline} the [United States toward those mutual
goals]{.underline}. "We are also looking to strengthen and enhance the
capabilities of European defense. But we don\'t want to build walls
where they are not necessary," the official said.

[There's a big reason not to build those walls]{.underline}, said Dan
Darling, vice president of market insights at Forecast International. He
said European defense independence by 2030 is unlikely, or at least very
difficult, due to industrial gaps.

#### No Norway-Russia war.

**Østhagen '18** \[Andreas; 6-19-2018; Senior Fellow at The Arctic
Institute, Senior Research Fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, PhD
in International Relations from the University of British Columbia; "How
Norway and Russia avoid Conflict over Svalbard," the Arctic Institute,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/norway-russia-avoid-conflict-svalbard/

In 1977, Norway established a maritime Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ)
around the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. [Norway avoided claiming an
outright]{.underline} Exclusive Economic Zone ([EEZ]{.underline})
[fearing it would be challenged due to]{.underline} stipulations (or
lack thereof) concerning extended maritime zones in [the Svalbard
Treaty]{.underline} from 1920.1) A dispute with Russia over the status
of the Zone arose, although the two countries quickly agreed to disagree
as long as Russian fishermen would have access to fisheries in the Zone.

In the late 1990s, Norwegian fisheries enforcement in the FPZ became
stricter, in tandem with declining fish stocks and fear of considerable
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Barents Sea.
This led the Norwegian Coast Guard to attempt to arrest Russian fishing
vessels on several occasions, resulting in reactions from Russian
fishermen, as well as officials in Murmansk and Moscow.2) In 1998, 2001,
2005, and 2011 specifically, incidents had the potential to escalate
beyond a fisheries issue.

Today, the [risk of events spiralling out of control]{.underline} in the
FPZ [remains a primary concern for both the Norwegian Coast Guard
and]{.underline} the Norwegian [Ministry of Defence.]{.underline}
Echoing these fears, in 2017 the Russian Defence Ministry deemed
Svalbard a potential area for future conflict with Norway, and in
consequence NATO.3) Given the potential volatility of events in the FPZ,
how do **[[Norway and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** manage to **[[avoid
escalation]{.mark} in the case of a crisis]{.underline}**? Two
intertwining relationships are integral to answering this.

Interest alignment

First, [**coop**eration **can be the product of discord**]{.underline}.
In other words, states cooperate when they disagree. Sometimes
[[institutions]{.mark} are needed to [overcome]{.mark} the [self-help
tendencies]{.mark} of the international system]{.underline}. Along this
line of argumentation, [cooperation between Norway and Russia concerning
shared fish stocks, oil spill response, search and rescue, and ship
traffic management are formalised arrangements]{.underline} set up [[to
manage]{.underline}]{.mark} potential areas of
[[discord]{.underline}]{.mark}. Along the same line of argumentation,
the Barents Sea maritime boundary agreement in 2010 was a result of
interests between the two states converging sufficiently.4)

In other words, **[the [reason]{.mark} why [Norway and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** manage to **[[keep]{.mark} crises [from
escalating]{.mark}]{.underline}** further **[[is mutual interest
in]{.mark} preserving]{.underline}** aspects of their
[**[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}; cooperation that benefits both
parties. This relates to multiple issue areas. Concerning resource
management, Russia is assumed to be satisfied with the current quota
scheme, in contrast to what might be achieved if an actual debate over
the status of the FPZ took place.5) Concerning the UNCLOS-regime,
[[both]{.mark} parties]{.underline} [[benefit from]{.mark} a [stable
legal regime]{.mark}]{.underline} in the FPZ specifically, but also [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} at large.6) And concerning national
security, [[both]{.underline}]{.mark} parties [[have]{.mark} an
[interest in **low levels of conflict**]{.mark} for fear of coercive
efforts by other actors within and outside the Barents/Arctic
region]{.underline}.7)

Nicholas **Miller 22**, associate professor of government at Dartmouth
College, author of the book *Stopping the Bomb: The Sources and
Effectiveness of U.S. Nonproliferation Policy*, 10/17/2022, \"Why the
War in Ukraine Won't Spark a Nuclear Proliferation Cascade,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/17/ukraine-war-russia-nuclear-proliferation-iran-south-korea/

Soon after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his renewed
invasion of Ukraine in February, analysts began warning of dire
consequences for the global nuclear order.

Russia's invasion, the argument goes, shows that nuclear weapons can
provide a shield that enables conquest. After all, Putin has used
nuclear threats from the outset of the war to help deter Western
intervention, and U.S. President Joe Biden himself has made clear the
prospect of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, powerfully shaping his
caution about direct U.S. involvement.

At the same time, [Russian aggression shows how difficult it is for
**nonnuclear** states to deter]{.underline} their nuclear [adversaries.
According to this]{.underline} line of [argument, if only Ukraine had
its own **nuclear arsenal**, Russia **wouldn't** have dared
attack]{.underline} it---just like the United States probably wouldn't
have attacked a nuclear-armed Iraq under former President Saddam Hussein
or a nuclear-armed Libya under former leader Muammar al-Qaddafi.
(Ukraine relinquished the Soviet nuclear weapons, which it never had
operational control over, that were left on its territory in the 1990s
after the Soviet Union's collapse.)

The lesson thus seems clear: Whether you're a status quo power or a
dissatisfied aggressor, you'll be better off with the bomb. According to
Yale University historian Timothy Snyder, who has taken the argument
perhaps the farthest, unless Ukraine dispels these lessons by defeating
Russia, the result will be "global [nuclear
**[prolif]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}."

[[Commentators]{.mark} are]{.underline} often [[**not specific**
about]{.underline}]{.mark} exactly [[which
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} they believe [will [take part]{.mark} in
this **cascade**]{.underline}, but [one can imagine **Iran** concluding
a nuclear arsenal]{.underline} would give it more leeway in the Middle
East, which would likely then lead Saudi Arabia to pursue a bomb
program. Likewise, [**Taiwan** or **So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline} might
become increasingly worried about facing an invasion by their
nuclear-armed adversaries, causing them to seek a nuclear arsenal.

[Although]{.underline} the [logic of these [arg]{.mark}ument[s]{.mark}
is persuasive at **first glance**, they [are
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} well [**[supported]{.mark}**
by]{.underline} the **[history]{.underline}** of nuclear proliferation,
in large part because [they [overlook]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[complexity of nuclear decision-making]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[From]{.underline} the **[1950s]{.underline}** onward,
[[analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} and government officials [have been
[predicting **prolif**]{.mark}eration cascades or **domino
effects**]{.underline}, where there would be a rapid increase in the
number of states with nuclear weapons. Most famously, then-U.S.
President John F. Kennedy warned in 1963 that he foresaw the possibility
of as many as 25 nuclear-armed states by 1980 unless the international
community got a handle on the problem.

[These predictions]{.underline} were **[[never borne
out]{.underline}]{.mark}**: The [number of states]{.underline} with
nuclear weapons [has grown rather **slowly**]{.underline}, especially
since the 1970s. Between 1945 and 1970, six states acquired the bomb
(about one every four years). Since then, only four countries have
additionally done so (about one every 13 years).

Why has [[prolif]{.mark}eration [proceeded]{.mark} so
**[slowly]{.mark}**]{.underline}? In large part [because
leaders]{.underline} like Kennedy [worried about it [and]{.mark}
adapted]{.underline} their [policies to **prevent** proliferation
cascades]{.underline}. Especially since the 1960s, a [[**powerful**
architecture]{.mark} for [prevent]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the
[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [has been
constructed]{.underline}. This includes [the
**[N]{.mark}**on-**[P]{.mark}**roliferation **[T]{.mark}**reaty,
economic **[sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline} policies adopted by the
United States and others, [the **[N]{.mark}**uclear
**[S]{.mark}**uppliers **[G]{.mark}**roup, and]{.underline} sometimes
[the [threat]{.mark} and use [of force]{.mark}]{.underline}---all of
which [have]{.underline} been shown to have **[restrained]{.underline}**
the [spread of nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

This [[architecture is]{.underline}]{.mark} still [in place **today**
and]{.underline} in some ways [[**stronger** than]{.mark} it has
[ever]{.mark} been]{.underline}. Today, almost every state without
nuclear weapons is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and perhaps
for the first time since 1945, [there are **[no
states]{.mark}**]{.underline} currently known to be [[seeking
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. (**[Iran]{.underline}**
is producing enriched uranium very close to weapons grade, but according
to the U.S. intelligence community, as of December 2021, there is [**no
evidence** it has made]{.underline} the [decision to build a
bomb]{.underline}.)

We also know from recent research that proliferation outcomes are not
determined by security incentives in the mechanistic way predicted by
those worried about the war in Ukraine's impact. In other words,
[states]{.underline} that [you may **think**]{.underline} would
[**want** nuclear weapons]{.underline} for protection or aggression
[often do **not**]{.underline} try to get them, [and [states]{.mark}
that try to get them]{.underline} sometimes [[**fail** due to
**domestic**]{.mark} **pathologies** or
**[divisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Many [states in threatening]{.underline} security [environments are
satisfied with]{.underline} relying on a [nuclear-armed
**ally**]{.underline} rather than seeking their own arsenals, despite
perennial concerns over the credibility of extended deterrence.
[[Japan]{.mark} is]{.underline} a **[classic example]{.underline}**: It
has [considered developing nuclear weapons]{.underline} at various
points since the 1950s [but]{.underline} has
[[concluded]{.underline}]{.mark} it's [[better off relying
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} than taking the risk of producing an
arsenal of its own.

Other states, such as [**Sweden** and **[Germany]{.mark}**]{.underline},
over time [[bought into]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**norm against**
developing nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. In some cases,
such as [**Argentina** and **Brazil**]{.underline} in the 1980s, there
[are]{.underline} domestic [**divisions** over]{.underline} the [utility
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and factions end up splitting the
difference by developing civilian nuclear technology without developing
an arsenal right away. [For]{.underline} countries highly dependent on
the international economy, such as [**Taiwan** or the **U**nited
**A**rab **E**mirates]{.underline}, the potential [**costs** of going
nuclear]{.underline} may **[outweigh]{.underline}** the security
[benefits]{.underline}.

[Even [countries]{.mark} that decide they **want** nuclear
weapons]{.underline} to protect themselves against (or coerce) an
adversary [often **[fail to acquire them]{.mark}**. **Authoritarian
states**]{.underline} in particular tend to [**mismanage** their
**nuclear programs**]{.underline}, as the cases of Iraq and Libya
illustrate.

All this evidence aside, one could still argue there is something unique
about the current conflict in **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
would overwhelm these historical dynamics. But this [[is **far**
from]{.mark} the **[first time]{.mark}** a [nuclear]{.mark}-armed
[state]{.mark} has [attacked]{.mark} a [nonnuclear]{.mark}
state]{.underline}, nor is it the first time a nuclear state has used
its nuclear arsenal to backstop coercion or aggression.

In [**1967**, Israel]{.underline} launched an [attack]{.underline} that
[resulted in]{.underline} the [occupation of]{.underline} the Golan
Heights, **[Gaza Strip]{.underline}**, West Bank, and Sinai Peninsula.
[Israel]{.underline} reportedly [considered unveiling]{.underline} its
recently acquired [nuclear arsenal if necessary to stave off defeat.
During]{.underline} the **[Vietnam War]{.underline}**, then-U.S.
President Richard [Nixon attempted to use]{.underline} veiled [nuclear
threats to coerce]{.underline} the [Soviets]{.underline} into pressuring
the North Vietnamese on peace negotiations. [Pakistan]{.underline} has
repeatedly [used]{.underline} its [**nuclear arsenal** as]{.underline} a
[cover for aggressive actions against India. Russia annexed Crimea
and]{.underline} occupied [parts of]{.underline} eastern
[Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 while [knowing it could use its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline} if necessary [to deter]{.underline} outside
[intervention]{.underline}.

[[In **no**]{.mark}**ne** of these [cases]{.mark}]{.underline} of
nuclear-backed aggression [[did]{.mark} **anything** approaching a
cascade of [prolif]{.mark}eration **[result]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nor
did the regime-change operations against Iraq and Libya---countries that
had given up their nuclear weapons programs under pressure---lead to a
rush for the bomb (though they may have helped convince North Korea to
hold on to what it has).

Is it possible that some countries might rethink their security options
as a result of what happens in Ukraine? Absolutely. But
[[countries]{.mark} are]{.underline} just as (or perhaps
**[more]{.underline}**) [likely to conclude]{.underline} that [they are
[better off finding]{.mark}]{.underline} or getting closer to [a
**[nuclear]{.mark}-armed [ally]{.mark}**]{.underline}---another
important form of protection Ukraine lacked, being outside of NATO---as
they are seeking their own arsenals. Even if one or two
**[countries]{.underline}** decide to seek a bomb, they [will have to
overcome **substantial obstacles** to **successfully acquire
one**]{.underline}.

There are good strategic reasons to hope Ukraine prevails---for
instance, it could help reinforce the norm against territorial conquest
and possibly reduce the odds of future Russian aggression---but the case
should not rest on averting [a **[cascade of
prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} that [[is **unlikely**]{.mark} to
**materialize** in any event]{.underline}.

[Greenland]{.mark}, despite possessing vast mineral reserves and past
ambitions from the U.S. to acquire it for these resources, [is **[not
interested in becoming a major mining superpower]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[The country\'s minister]{.mark} for business and mineral resources
[[emphasized a desire for **only 5 to 10 active**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[mines at any given time]{.mark},** [prioritizing high
environmental]{.mark}]{.underline}, social, and governance
[[standards]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Concerns about the environmental impact and the uncertain economic
return from mining activities, particularly with an unstable market for
rare earths, contribute to Greenland\'s cautious approach.

Greenland

Early in Donald Trump's presidency, he announced his ambitions to
acquire Greenland. In March, Trump said, "We need Greenland for
international safety and security. We need it. We have to have it." As
well as stating ambitions to counter Russia's presence in the Arctic,
taking control of Greenland would put vast quantities of rare earth
minerals and rare earth elements in the possession of the United States.
However, Denmark quickly shot down the idea of Trump's acquisition,
saying that Greenland was not for sale. Meanwhile, Trump's announcement
led several political figures in Greenland to suggest that Greenland
should be independent, rather than under the ownership of Denmark or the
U.S. 

International powers have long eyed Greenland for its vast mineral
potential. As several countries around the world strive to undergo a
green transition, the demand for critical minerals is expected to grow
dramatically in the coming years. Demand for critical energy transition
minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper could increase almost fourfold
by 2030, according to United Nations estimates. 

At present, China dominates the global mineral mining market. According
to International Energy Agency (IEA) data, China contributes around 80
percent of the world's natural graphite and 60 percent of mined magnet
rare earths. In 2024, it produced more than 60 percent of the world's
lithium, 40 percent of refined copper, and 70 percent of refined cobalt.
As the U.S. looks to reduce its reliance on China for energy, critical
minerals, and other goods, President Trump sees Greenland as the
potential solution. 

Greenland holds vast mineral reserves, including rare earth metals,
coal, graphite, uranium, copper, lead, and zinc. A 2023 Geological
Survey of Denmark and Greenland survey found that 25 of the 34 critical
raw materials recognised by the European Commission are present in
Greenland. In addition, [as ice]{.mark} sheets [melt]{.mark} due to
climate change, [[Greenland's previously hard-to-retrieve mineral
reserves are expected to become more accessible]{.underline}]{.mark}. 

Caroline Kennedy-Pipe, a professor of war studies and Arctic security
specialist at the U.K.'s Loughborough University, explained, "The fight
for infrastructure in the Arctic is incredibly important. Plus, because
Greenland's ice sheet is melting, and melting fast, those rare earth
minerals will become cheaper to access. So, these are seen as long-term
investments for America."

To date, mining activity [in Greenland]{.mark} has been limited, as
[[investors have avoided financing mining]{.mark} [operations due to the
**harsh conditions** and **environmental pushback**]{.mark}]{.underline}
from community groups. [[Developing]{.mark} [the country's mining
industry would **require significant funding**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
well as support from local groups. 

Around a decade ago, a team of geologists published a paper that warned
of unrealistic expectations for Greenland's mineral potential. It
states, "[[Even if estimates of the quantity and quality of ore in a
geological deposit are well documented... it is **difficult to translate
this into economic**]{.underline}]{.mark} potential and even more
difficult to predict a specific **[[revenue]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
Greenlandic society." 

Minik Thorleif Rosing, one of the authors of the report, said that the
situation remains relatively unchanged since the date of publication.
"There is a misconception that Greenland will be like a new Saudi
Arabia, only at the size of a small British town," Rosing said. He
blamed the uncertainty on global market conditions for rare earth
metals. [There has been significant pushback against mining
operations,]{.underline} as many Greenlanders believe **[[the cost of
mining will far outweigh the benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is
unclear just how much of a return on investment Greenland would see from
mining activities, as [[there is no stable market for rare]{.mark}
[earths]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Rosing. However, many are
more concerned about the environmental impact of mining in the Arctic. 

In June, Naaja Nathanielsen, [[Greenland's minister]{.underline}]{.mark}
for business and mineral resources, said that while some mining
operations are already underway in the country, there is little interest
in Greenland becoming a major mining power. "For Greenland, we are not
necessarily interested in becoming a really great mining country. We
just really want 5 or 10 active mines at any given time," said
Nathanielsen. "We are a very small population, so for us, we don't need
the entire country to be covered in mines. We are happy with managing a
few, and I think that is feasible," she added. 

Nathanielsen [[emphasised the "**very high"
environmental**]{.underline},]{.mark} social and governance (ESG)
[[**standards** held by]{.mark} [Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}. She
said, "I think the people of Greenland really support the mining
industry, which is quite kind of rare when you look at other
jurisdictions. But they do so because they have faith in us having a
high environmental standard and taking care of local communities."
Nathanielsen went on to say that [[if the]{.mark} [government
compromises its environmental standards]{.mark}]{.underline}, it could
lead [[Greenlanders]{.underline}]{.mark} [to [no longer support]{.mark}
[the mining industry]{.mark}]{.underline}, which could be highly
detrimental for future projects.

### Greenland Says No\-\--2NC

#### Trump ruins chances of mining

Since Greenland took control of its mineral resources, Denmark has been
reluctant to get involved in mining projects. That could very well
change[. [Denmark]{.mark} and the E.U. [may]{.mark} come under pressure
to [invest in]{.mark} much-needed [infrastructure and energy
projects]{.mark} and offer loans on more favorable
conditions]{.underline}, **[if for no other reason than [to keep the
United States at bay]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Though the situation is highly unstable, [it's important]{.mark} to try,
at least, [to separate the geopolitical posturing from the realities of
mining]{.mark}. [In that vein]{.mark}, it's safe to say **[[there will
be no operating rare earth mines in Greenland during the term of Donald
J. Trump]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[Kvanefjeld is the only project in Greenland with well-documented
reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it suffers from--or, some would say,
could potentially benefit from--a high content of uranium and thorium.

In 2021, [[when the project was in the final phase of getting an
exploitation license]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [Greenland]{.mark}ic
government dug in its heels and [[made it illegal to mine
deposits]{.underline}]{.mark} with more than 100 parts per million of
uranium. The new regulations were used against the Australian company
behind the Kvanefjeld project, [[rendering worthless years of heavy
investments; more than US \$100 million was reportedly spent on
drilling]{.mark}]{.underline} and other work.

The company filed a request for arbitration in 2022, and in 2024 it
commenced legal proceedings against the Greenland and Danish
governments. It may be years before these cases are resolved. In the
meantime, this case is likely to harm investment in Greenland due to the
[[climate of high political risk it suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Greenland has high environmental standards for mining

Greenland's Nathanielsen said [[the territory has **"very high"
environmental**]{.underline}]{.mark}, social and governance (ESG)
**[[standards]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in part [[because of its previous
issues with mining pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"I think [the people of Greenland really support the mining
industry]{.underline}, which is quite kind of rare when you look at
other jurisdictions. But they do so [because they have faith in us
having a high environmental standard and taking care of local
communities]{.underline}," Nathanielsen said.

"And [[if we start to fold on that, we will also lose the people's
support of this industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[For us it is
really]{.mark} [importan]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark}**. So, I think
[[we have learned from the past]{.underline}]{.mark}," she added.

But [Greenlanders]{.mark} have also expressed caution about any new
heavy industry. They [are protective of]{.mark} [their
environment]{.mark}, which is being shaken up by climate change: The
Arctic is warming nearly four times as fast as the rest of the world,
which will most likely make the mineral resources more accessible.

[[The island's governing political party]{.underline}]{.mark} swept into
office four years ago on an environmentalist platform and [**[shut down

Greenland, on March 6, 2025.

**[[Greenland has little interest in harnessing its massive resource

The world's largest island has been thrust into the geopolitical
spotlight in recent months, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly
saying that Washington should control the autonomous Danish territory
--- even refusing to rule out the use of military or economic force.

[Trump's pursuit of Greenland]{.underline} comes as mining executives
[describe the race for]{.underline} the Arctic island's [largely
untapped extractable resources as an "enormous
opportunity]{.underline}." However, [[Greenland's harsh climate, remote
landscape and lack of infrastructure have all been cited as barriers to

#### U.S. securitization of Greenland mirrors the War on Terror's logic\-\--Faming strategic landscapes as existential threats justifies imperial extraction, entrenches global militarism, and unleashes cascading securitization across regions and sectors.

In the summer of 2019, Donald [Trump's idea of]{.underline} buying
[Greenland drew **renewed attention** to its]{.underline} geostrategic
[location and revealed **widespread misunderstandings** of
its]{.underline} current [constitutional status]{.underline}. Trump
equated the idea to similar past purchase attempts, but since times of
colonization Greenland had taken several steps to increase its autonomy.
This meant that if a purchase should be proposed, it should have been
addressed to the Government of Greenland, which, prompted or not, did
not fail to respond on twitter: "We're open for business, not for sale"
(GreenlandMFA 2019). While many ridiculed the outdated idea,
[it]{.underline} soon [became apparent that it **reflected**
a]{.underline} more [profound [**shift** in the U.S. **security**
perspective on the Arctic region]{.mark}]{.underline} as being embedded
in international great power competition with Russia and, especially,
China. In response, [the United States [looked to Greenland with the
**aim** of **strengthening** its]{.mark} regional [**presence** and
securing access to]{.mark}]{.underline} strategically [important
**[minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as rare earth elements that are
critical components in many types of modern and so-called 'critical'
technologies.

Whereas the dual awareness of natural resources and convenient military
strategic location [[reflected the **root** of the U.S. interest in
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}, the international power relations [and
the American security **perspectives**]{.underline} have changed
throughout history. The aim of this chapter is to provide the first
coherent analysis of the defining acts [[shaping]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**development** of U.S. [security **interests**]{.mark} in
Greenland during the past **200 years**]{.underline}. In order to do so,
we dissect how [securitization acts]{.underline} and attempts have been
carried out at specific times in history by pointing to perceived
threats as legitimization of extraordinary means. When doing so, we
employ the Copenhagen School's analytical apparatus as explained in the
introductory chapter while paying special attention to the scales,
audiences, and cascading effects of the particular securitizations. This
means that we are extra attentive to whether the perceived threats have
been articulated as, for instance, an international, regional, or
national matter, whether the securitizations have [had effects
beyond]{.underline} the [described purposes]{.underline}, and [who [the
United States]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[considered]{.underline}]{.mark}
relevant [[recipients with agency to **accept** or **refuse** the
**securitization**]{.mark} act]{.underline}. We believe that these three
specific foci---which we will soon explain in more details---provide
effective tools in finding answers to our research questions, which are:
Why has United States securitized Greenland, how have securitizations
been received, and with what consequences?

When answering these questions, we show how [securitizations have been
[**discursively** constructed as]{.mark}]{.underline} part of
[overarching security **developments** in which [the
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[considered Greenland a **geostrategic**
piece of land]{.underline}]{.mark} in the protection of U.S.
self-interests and its balance of power against shifting enemies. As we
shall see, the articulated [reasons of the securitization acts have
varied]{.underline} by sometimes pointing to referent objects at other
scales such as 'Western hemisphere,' 'NATO area,' and 'international
peace' in the quest to gain acceptance of extraordinary means. [[The
**choice** of words]{.underline}]{.mark} has to some extent been
[[guided by]{.mark} the **[congruent agency]{.mark}** ascribed
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} Denmark and [[Greenland]{.mark},
which]{.underline} at different times in history, and in different ways,
[have been [considered **inactive spectators**]{.mark}]{.underline} or
as part of the relevant audience with power to provide formal or moral
support. The [U.S. rhetoric]{.underline}, however, has occasionally
[been [a play to]{.mark} the gallery]{.underline}, as the extraordinary
means in a few instances have been carried out prior to the
**[[rhetorical securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, hence highlighting
the unequal power relationship and the lack of depth of actual
acknowledged agency. In other instances, Denmark has both acted as the
accepting audience and carried out the extraordinary means even though
it **[jeopardized]{.underline}** domestic laws or entailed negative
consequences at lower scales. It is important to note that throughout
most of the historical period analyzed in this chapter, Greenland was a
colony to Denmark, thereby being ruled out in the U.S.-Denmark decision
making and deliberations roughly until after home rule was introduced in
1979. By focusing on [**cascading** effects of U.S.
securitizations]{.underline}, we seek to bring attention to some of the
derived consequences that, regrettably, are [**seldom** part
of]{.underline} analyses of [U.S. security **interests** in
Greenland]{.underline} and the Arctic.

Our analysis is divided into the six analytical periods of 1823--1914,
1914--39, 1939--45, 1945--91, 1991--2018, and 2018--21, delimited by the
signing of the Monroe Doctrine, the outbreak of World War I, the
beginning and end of World War II, the ensuing Cold War, its end, and
the most recent, and still active, U.S. security perspective on
Greenland and the Arctic where China and Russia are seen as great power
competitors. This periodization rests upon a U.S. perspective of widely
acknowledged shifts in the American geopolitical visions that have
happened alongside U.S. securitization acts and attempts regarding
Greenland.1 Before turning to the analysis of these time spans, we will
now explain our choice of theoretical tools and our selection of
empirical data.

In continuation of the introduction's basic explanation of
[securitization theory]{.underline}, we will here [focus on scales,
**[cascading effects]{.mark}**, and audiences]{.underline} that we find
particularly relevant in the effort to get a better understanding of why
securitizing acts have been executed, how they have been received, and
with what consequences.

First, we are especially attentive to what scale [the referent
**object** is **discursively** placed on]{.underline} because it can
help us uncover what or who exactly the securitizing actor pointed to as
being threatened in the attempt to convince the relevant audience of
accepting the use of extraordinary means. Was it, for instance, [[a
**threat** to]{.underline}]{.mark} '[the **West**]{.underline},'
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} '**[[regional Arctic
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**,' or to 'U.S. sovereignty' that [was
[articulated as the reason for]{.mark} a **specific** U.S.
**[securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline} with relation to Greenland at
some point in history? By paying special attention to the prioritized
scale in a securitization (attempt), we seek to dissect the given reason
for legitimizing the use of extraordinary means and to draw attention to
the consequences the prioritization of one scale may have had for
entities at other scales given less or no attention in the
securitization act. When applying this approach, we rely on Buzan and
Wæver's (2009) article in which they lay out connections across the
spectrum of scales as spanning from the global to the individual with
system, civilizational, unit, and groups covering the middle ground
(2009, 259). Among these, [the **Copenhagen** School]{.underline} has
traditionally identified an [**empirical precedence** to
egotistical]{.underline} collective [units such as]{.underline}---and
most often--- [states and their **protection** of
sovereignty]{.underline} on the national scale [when relating to other
**similar** entities through]{.underline} amity or
**[enmity]{.underline}** (Buzan and Wæver 2009, 254--55). This does not,
however, indicate that referent objects at higher or lower scales than
the national are not relevant to securitization processes. Instead, it
is a consequence of the challenging process of successfully declaring,
for example, 'humankind' on the system level or 'human being' on the
individual level as threatened and particularly devising meaningful
extraordinary means to their protection (Buzan and Wæver 2009, 254--55).
This is because the relevant audience, the securitizing actor's scope of
power and, hence, the possible extraordinary means are here not as
clearly defined as they are within the boundaries of a state, which
remains the most powerful unit in Buzan and Wæver's analysis. In their
investigation into what happens above2 the scale of collective units,
[Buzan and Wæver show how international [security]{.mark}]{.underline}
in a few instances [[is structured by]{.mark} [**one** single]{.mark}
overarching [**conflict** that]{.mark}]{.underline} "[**incorporate**,
**[align]{.mark}** and **rank** [the]{.mark} more [**parochial
securitisations** beneath it]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Buzan and Wæver
2009, 253), hence obtaining the status [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
so-called [[macrosecuritization]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[example]{.underline}]{.mark} par excellence [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[Cold]{.mark} [War]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[where]{.underline}]{.mark}as [[the **Global War on
Terror**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the current climate change
**[discourse]{.underline}** are [located on a **high
scale**]{.underline} though not being as all-encompassing due to a
lesser degree of widespread acceptance (Buzan and Wæver 2009, 254; see
Kristensen and Mortensgaard, chap. 2, this vol.). In our analysis, these
three [[major securitizations **constitute**
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark} elements of the historical context
coconstituting U.S. engagements in Greenland. We will show how
articulations of these overarching conflicts have differed throughout
history due to their perceived relevance but also depending on what the
relevant audience would accept as an existential threat.

Our second theoretical point of attention is **[[cascading
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which]{.underline} so far are
remarkably seldom highlighted in securitization analyses, though such
observations are straightforward to make (cf. Wæver 2017, 126). Thierry
Balzacq and Ulrik Pram Gad are among the few who have previously done
so, but their uses of the concept differ from one another. In Balzacq's
(2010, 37) inquiry into methods of securitization theory, he uses the
concept to explain the cascading effects [within a **recipient**
audience]{.underline}, [[where people]{.underline}]{.mark} may be
[[**convinced** by their friend's **acceptance** of a securitization
**act** and]{.underline}]{.mark} may subsequently [[**convince**
others]{.underline}]{.mark}, [hence [**continuing** the **cascade** of
acceptance]{.mark}]{.underline} and, one may add, possible refusal of a
securitization attempt. In another perspective, Ulrik Pram Gad (2021,
125--27) has used the concept to show how one
[securitization]{.underline} may [[trigger a
**second**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[activates a **third**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **so**
on]{.underline}]{.mark}, in his analysis of translations of security
cascading at the Thule Air Base. With inspiration from Gad, we seek to
develop his approach by pointing attention to two kinds of cascading
securitizations, namely vertical and horizontal ones:3 The vertical
cascading effect of a securitization is the situation when a
securitization articulated at one scale moves to a lower scale, with
consequences beyond the initial intention of the securitizing actor.
[**[Horizontal]{.mark}** cascading [effects]{.mark}]{.underline} instead
[describe]{.underline} the movement from one sector to another as for
example [[when the **transformative** force of]{.mark}]{.underline}
climate [[change triggers **insecurity** in several
other]{.underline}]{.mark}4 [[sectors]{.underline}]{.mark} (cf. Jacobsen
and Herrmann 2017, 7), [[such as]{.mark} moving from the]{.underline}
environmental to the societal, [economic]{.underline}, or even military
[sector if **[resource scarcity]{.mark}** leads to
conflict]{.underline}. The horizontal and vertical
[[cascades]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[happen at the same
time]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as [[when]{.mark} an **[international
securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline} of climate change [[also affects
**national** policies]{.mark} that]{.underline} further [cascade onto
**local** households]{.underline}, perhaps by setting new requirements
for their daily living. As our analysis will show, there have been
examples when a U.S. securitization has been [articulated
as]{.underline} part of a **[[macrosecuritization]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to legitimize extraordinary means, which subsequently has had vertical
cascading effects on the Arctic region, Greenland, and its population,
while simultaneously cascading horizontally from one sector onto several
others.

#### Greenlandic mining revives settler colonial logics as Denmark infantilizes Inuit governance, portraying resource development as dangerous without white supervision.

**Sejersen '19** \[Frank; August 8; Department of Cross-Cultural and
Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen; Polar Record, "Brokers of
hope: Extractive industries and the dynamics of future-making in
post-colonial Greenland," 10.1017/S0032247419000457\] //jwh

The [[routes]{.underline}]{.mark} and potentialities [[created
by]{.mark} the construction of a]{.underline} "**[[future
us]{.underline}]{.mark}**" are [[**deeply** situated
in]{.underline}]{.mark} post-**[colonial
[discou]{.mark}rse]{.underline}**, and recurrently the
Danish-Greenlandic affective relations take centre stage in discussions
and are played out in new ways (Gad, 2009, 2016) -- also by brokers of
hope. The colonial relationship has often been compared to a parent and
child relationship, and this metaphor was used creatively by the brokers
of hope to establish ideas of new beginnings through new partnerships
(with the Chinese). Much of the historical relationship between Denmark
and Greenland can be characterised as a relationship where Denmark took
the role and saw itself as protector and introducer of modernity.
According to Paine (1977), the [[relationship between **Inuit** and
**white** people]{.mark}]{.underline} generally has been [[characterised
by]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**superior** attitude by the whites]{.mark}
who]{.underline} have [pointed at their]{.underline} technical,
[**political**, **moral** and **cultural** superiority [to
**legitimise** colonial **interventions**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
attitudes. [This [image of oneself as superior]{.mark}]{.underline} and
a counter image of the Inuit have [[produced]{.mark} an [**othering**
process where Inuit have been related to]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
basis of [[the **child metaphor**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Gad, 2016;
Langgård, 2013; Rud, 2014; Thisted, 2012; Thomsen, 1998). This child
metaphor results in a number of related understandings of the Inuit:
[they need to **learn** from the **whites**, they need to
be]{.underline} tutored, [**guided** and helped]{.underline} and to be
protected from the world until mature enough to engage in it.
Consequently, [the gradual **historical** change from **colonial
dependence** to]{.underline} more [self-determination]{.underline} has
often been [phrased as]{.underline} similar to [a **maturing
child**]{.underline} getting ready to move away from home -- away from
the well-meaning care, embracing protection and supervision of parents
(Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2018). The relationship between Denmark
and Greenland can be understood by the concept of pastoral power, where
Inuit in their helplessness (as seen from Denmark) are taken under the
motherly wings of the Danes, brought into the modern world with the best
intentions and rewarded when following the new standards and values.
[[In **Arctic literature**, this image of **Inuit** as **childlike**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} extremely [[widespread]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Vallee (1962) was one of the first to describe this relation, and
Parsons (1970, p. 38) noted in his study of whites in the Canadian North
the "widespread conviction that natives tend to behave in a manner which
is essentially child-like, and thus like children, they must be taught
to exercise initiative, develop self-reliance, practice self-restraint,
and generally cope with a complex, changing world". [This **child-like**
position]{.underline} furthermore [[links to the **perception** of
Inuit]{.mark} as **closer** to nature]{.underline} compared to Western
people. Being "children of nature" and "children of the moment" (Müller,
1906) they are, of course, to [[face problems]{.mark} [when they
meet]{.mark}]{.underline} the giants of modernisation be it the big city
[or the transnational **[mining]{.mark}** company]{.underline}. This
presupposed childish attitude has been a permanent theme in writings
about the Arctic -- and it is still today. Ann Fienup-Riordan (1990,
1995) terms the production of this image Arctic Orientalism. [It is this
complex]{.underline} post-**[[colonial]{.underline}]{.mark}** political
and affective [field that the [**brokers** of hope]{.mark} need to
**navigate**]{.underline} diligently.

A [**Greenland** faced with]{.underline} an industrial [**future**
[driven b]{.mark}y]{.underline} large [transnational corporations with
[huge]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese [[investments]{.underline} [and
**thousands** of workers]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[created]{.mark} a
**[fear]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Denmark that [the Greenlanders will
**not** be able to **handle** the situation]{.underline} -- at least not
on their own and without help. If not helped, [[Greenland would be
turned]{.mark} [into a]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese **[[work
camp]{.underline}]{.mark}** as mentioned in a Danish newspaper
(Jyllands-Posten, 2013). Despite the fact that Greenland under the
Self-rule Act has the right, possibility and responsibility to manage
the its non-renewable resources, the Danes maintain to be concerned. In
2013 (May 20), the former Danish foreign minister Uffe Elleman Jensen
raised concern about the Arctic interests shown by China and other Asian
countries. He concluded that it was about time that Denmark and
Greenland joined forces to protect themselves against "[the many [**big
hungry wolfs** that **forage** the landscape]{.mark} on the
[**look-out** for]{.mark} opportunities to get **close** to the natural
[**wealth** that everyone dreams about
**exploiting**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (translated by the author,
Ellemann, 2013).

He had three focus points: (1) China has [**[predator
interests]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}; (2) the West should
protect itself, its sovereignty and its resources from this threat; (3)
Greenland and Denmark should cooperate to withstand the pressure from
the outside.

By stating this, he joined the choir of Danes that expressed concern
about Greenlandic wealth that may be grabbed by foreign firms --
especially Chinese. The problem was understood as [[**more** than just
**profit**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [would run out of the Danish
Kingdom]{.underline}. It was also phrased as a security problem that
China potentially would get access and control over resources important
for the Western world. In line with this way of thinking, the Danish
political party Dansk Folkeparti encouraged (and even demanded) that
Denmark and Western firms entered the Greenlandic scene in order to
secure the resources and Western interests from Chinese dominance. If
not done, Dansk Folkeparti claimed, the Chinese [[would have **huge
power** over]{.mark} a **large part** of [the world]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ritzau, 2013b). Dansk Folkeparti wanted Denmark to take responsibility
immediately -- "[otherwise **history** will judge us hard]{.underline}",
as the party's spokesperson announced. It seemed as if Denmark really
needed a wakeup call, and the Danish admiral Nils Wang also added
that"the EU and the US have been utterly inattentive"(translated by the
author, as cited in Halskov & Davidsen-Nielsen, 2012) and thus given
China the best opportunities. Foreign experts aired the same concern
about Chinese expansion. In a warning statement from Hugh Stephens in
The Diplomat, he underlined that "one thing is certain: China's
[[**interests** in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether [regarding
possibilities [for **expanded**]{.mark}]{.underline} navigation and
shipping, [access to [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, concerns over the
environmental impact of the melting ice packs or possibly even defense
and security issues in the region, [are **[only going to
grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Canada (and the US) would be wise to take
note" (Stephens, 2012).
