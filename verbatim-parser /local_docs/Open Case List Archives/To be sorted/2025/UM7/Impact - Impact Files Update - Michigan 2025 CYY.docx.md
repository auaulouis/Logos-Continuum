## AI 

### Singularity Good\-\--1NC 

**AI takeover solves extinction---it's a [better
decision-maker]{.underline} than humans**

**Cerf and Waytz 23** (Moran Cerf is a professor of neuroscience and

via University of Michigan online library) lc

A threat even more dire than misinformation is the "risk of extinction
from AI" that the Center for AI Safety highlights in its open statement.
Yet, **[in terms of whether machines or humans are more likely to
initiate extinction-level events such as nuclear war]{.underline}**,
**[humans]{.underline}** still seem to **[have the upper
hand]{.underline}**. **[In recent empirical work that
analyzes]{.underline}** the decision processes employed by senior
leaders in **[war-game scenarios]{.underline}** involving weapons/ of
mass destruction, [**humans** showed an alarming **tend**ency **to err
on the side of initiating catastrophic attacks**]{.underline}.Footnote5
[**These simulations, if implemented in reality, would pose much graver
risks to humanity than machine**-driven one**s**]{.underline}. **[Our
exploration of the use of AI in critical decision-making has shown AI's
superiority to human decisions in nearly all scenarios]{.underline}**.
In most cases, the AI makes the choice that humans do not make at
first---but then, upon more careful consideration and deliberation,
change their minds and do make, realizing it was the correct decision
all along. **[Other]{.underline}**, more quotidian **[concerns raised
about AI apply far more to human beings than to machines]{.underline}**.
Consider algorithmic bias, the phenomenon whereby algorithms involved in
hiring decisions, medical diagnoses, or image detection produce outcomes
that unfairly disadvantage a particular social group. For example, when
Amazon implemented an algorithmic recruiting tool to score new
applicants' resumes, the algorithm systematically rated female
applicants worse than men, in large part because the algorithm was
trained on resumes submitted over the previous 10 years that were
disproportionately male.Footnote6 In other words, **[an algorithm
trained on human bias will reproduce this bias.]{.underline}** Unlike
humans, **[however, algorithmic bias can be readily
deprogrammed]{.underline}**, or as economist Sendhil Mullainathan puts
it, "**[Biased algorithms are easier to fix than biased
people]{.underline}**."Footnote7 Mullainathan and colleagues' research
showed that an algorithm used by UnitedHealth to score patients' health
risks systematically underscored black patients relative to white
patients because it measured illness in terms of health-care costs
(which are systematically lower for black versus white individuals,
given that society spends less on black patients) (Obermeyer et al.
Citation2019). However, once identified, the researchers could easily
modify this feature of the algorithm to produce risk scores that were
relatively unbiased. Other work has shown that algorithms can produce
less racially biased outcomes (and more effective public safety
outcomes) than human judges in terms of decisions about whether or not
to grant bail to defendants awaiting trial (Kleinberg et al.
Citation2018). As biased as algorithms can be, their biases appear less
ingrained and more pliable than those of humans. Compounded by recent
work showing that, in hiring and lending contexts, managers reject
biased algorithms in favor of more biased humans, the suggestion that
humans should remain at the helm of those functions is, at best,
questionable (Cowgill, Dell'acqua, and Matz Citation2020). Finally,
consider the threat to cybersecurity. Although commentators have
warnedFootnote8,Footnote9,Footnote10 that large language models add
tools to the arsenals of hackers by democratizing cybercrime, **[most
high-profile information leaks and hacks to date are ushered in by human
beings with no reliance on AI]{.underline}** (i.e. a disgruntled
employee who knows the system\'s flaws and perpetrates an attack by
remembering key passwords, or bad programmers who effectively enable
future attacks by making wrong assumptions on their software
use-cases---such as "no one would create a password that is 1,000,000
characters long" leading to a classical buffer overflow hack). In fact,
**[AI is often the last bastion of defense against those
hacks]{.underline}**, [**identifying complex human** coding **mistakes
early-on and correcting them.**]{.underline} Recently, national
guardsman Jack Teixeira, who exposed highly classified material in an
online chat group, did not require sophisticated technology to access
sensitive documents---he was granted top secret clearance from the
Pentagon. Further, a recent study conducted by IBM indicates that 95
percent of security breaches were caused by human errors such as biting
on phishing scams or downloading malware.Footnote11 If anything, the
most concerning cybersecurity risk currently posed by AI results from
its increased reliance on human trained code, which is flawed. AI takes
hackable human codes and uses them to generate new codes, spreading
these human-generated errors further. The only concerning current
cybersecurity attacks by AI involve AI that simulates human
communication to dupe humans into revealing key information.
Cybersecurity may represent a case in which technology is more likely to
be the solution rather than the problem, with research indicating, for
example, that humans working with AI outperform humans alone in
detecting machine-manipulated media such as deepfakes (Groh et al.
Citation2021). **[Even when technology contributes to unwanted outcomes,
humans are often the ones pressing the buttons.]{.underline}** Consider
the effect of AI on unemployment. The Future of Life Institute letter
raises concerns that AI will eliminate jobs, yet whether or not to
eliminate jobs is a choice that humans ultimately make. Just because AI
can perform the jobs of, say, customer service representatives does not
mean that companies should outsource these jobs to bots. In fact,
research indicates that many customers would prefer to talk to a human
than to a bot, even if it means waiting in a queue.Footnote12 Along
similar lines, increasingly common statements that AI-based
systems---like "the Internet," "social media," or the set of
interconnected online functions referred to as "The Algorithm"---are
destroying mental health,Footnote13 causing political
polarization,Footnote14 or threatening democracyFootnote15 neglect an
obvious fact: These systems are populated and run by human beings.
Blaming technology lets people off the hook. Although expressions of
concern toward AI are invaluable in matching the excitement around new
technology with caution, outsized news cycles around the threats of
technology can distract from the threats of human beings. Recent
research indicates that humans have a "finite pool of attention" such
that "when we pay more attention to one threat, our attention to other
threats decreases" (Sisco et al. Citation2023). So, as we contend with
the rise of AI and its concomitant harms to privacy, human survival, and
our relationship with truth itself, we must equally pay attention to the
humans who are already well equipped to perpetrate these harms without
the assistance of machines. Specifically, **[it has not escaped our
notice that when engaging in a conversation about the risks of AI, the
benchmark is often "is AI perfect in handling this task"]{.underline}**
(making critical decisions or guiding a self-driving car), **[rather
than "is it better than humans." The answer to the latter question in
many cases, is that yes[, AI can mitigate the risks to
humanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Singularity Bad\-\--2AC 

#### AI sucks. 

**Klare 23** (Michael T. Klare,  Five Colleges professor of Peace and
World Security Studies, whose department is located at Hampshire
College, "AI vs. AI: Flash Wars and Human Extinction" 7/13/2024.

wtk

Such a prospect should be ample cause for concern. To start with,
**[consider the risk of errors and miscalculations by the
algorithms]{.underline}** at the heart of such systems. As top computer
scientists have warned us, those **[algorithms are capable of remarkably
inexplicable]{.underline}** mistakes and, to use the AI term of the
moment, "**[hallucinations]{.underline}**" --- that is, **[seemingly
reasonable results that are entirely illusionary]{.underline}**. Under
the circumstances, **[it's not hard to imagine such computers
"hallucinating" an imminent enemy attack and launching a war that might
otherwise have been avoided.]{.underline}** And **[that's not the worst
of the dangers to consider]{.underline}**. After all, **[there's the
obvious likelihood that America's adversaries will similarly equip their
forces with robot generals]{.underline}**. In other words, [**future
wars are likely to [be ]{.mark}**[fought by]{.mark} one set of [AI
**s**]{.mark}**ystems** [against another, both]{.mark} **linked to
nuclear weaponry**]{.underline}[, **[with]{.underline}**]{.mark}
entirely [unpredictable]{.mark} --- but potentially
[**[catastrophic]{.underline}** --- **[results]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
**[Not much is known]{.underline}** (from public sources at least)
**[about Russian and Chinese efforts to automate their military
command-and-control systems, but both countries are thought to be
developing networks comparable to]{.underline}** the Pentagon's
**[JADC2]{.underline}**. As early as 2014, in fact, Russia inaugurated a
National Defense Control Center (NDCC) in Moscow, a centralized command
post for assessing global threats and initiating whatever military
action is deemed necessary, whether of a non-nuclear or nuclear nature.
Like JADC2, the NDCC is designed to collect information on enemy moves
from multiple sources and provide senior officers with guidance on
possible responses.

China is said to be pursuing an even more elaborate, if similar,
enterprise under the rubric of "Multi-Domain Precision Warfare" (MDPW).
According to the Pentagon's 2022 report on Chinese military
developments, its military, the People's Liberation Army, is being
trained and equipped to use AI-enabled sensors and computer networks to
"rapidly identify key vulnerabilities in the U.S. operational system and
then combine joint forces across domains to launch precision strikes
against those vulnerabilities."

**[Picture, then, a future war between the U.S. and Russia or
China]{.underline}** (or both) **[in which the JADC2 commands all U.S.
forces, while Russia's NDCC and China's MDPW command those countries'
forces.]{.underline}** Consider, as well, that all three systems are
likely to experience errors and hallucinations. **[[How safe will humans
be when robot generals decide that it's time to "win" the war by nuking
their enemies?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[If this strikes you as an outlandish scenario, think
again]{.underline}**, at least according to the leadership of the
National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a
congressionally mandated enterprise that was chaired by Eric Schmidt,
former head of Google, and Robert Work, former deputy secretary of
defense. "While the Commission believes that properly designed, tested,
and utilized AI-enabled and autonomous weapon systems will bring
substantial military and even humanitarian benefit, **[the unchecked
global use of such systems potentially risks unintended conflict
escalation and crisis instability]{.underline}**," it affirmed in its
Final Report. Such dangers could arise, it stated, "**[because of
challenging and untested complexities of interaction between AI-enabled
and autonomous weapon systems on the battlefield]{.underline}**" ---
when, that is, AI fights AI.

## Chinese Tech 

### Chinese Tech Bad\-\--2AC 

#### China weaponize tech supremacy to undermine democracies and expand authoritarianism, which leads to extinction.

**Waters 6/9**, an advisor to governments, activists, academics, and
NGOs and President of the Elephant Project. "China's Use of AI and its
Negative Impact on the World" 6-9-25.
https://henryjacksonsociety.org/publications/chinas-use-of-ai-and-its-negative-impact-on-the-world/

China's rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have
significantly reshaped the global landscape, with profound implications
for security, economic stability and democratic values. While AI holds
immense potential for innovation and efficiency, [under [China's
authoritarian]{.mark} use of it, [AI]{.mark} has become a tool [for mass
surveillance, censorship, disinformation, military expansion and
economic coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}. This report analyses how [[China
weaponises AI to consolidate power]{.mark}, [influenc]{.mark}e global
[narratives]{.mark}, how Chinese AI companies must comply with the CCP's
orders, [and]{.mark} how this [undermine]{.mark}s [demo]{.mark}cratic
institutions [worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the domestic level,
China has developed the most sophisticated AI-powered surveillance
state, utilising facial recognition, predictive policing, and biometric
data-tracking to monitor its citizens and suppress dissent. [[The Great
Firewall]{.underline}]{.mark} -- an AI-driven censorship mechanism --
[[controls]{.underline}]{.mark} the flow of
[[information]{.underline}]{.mark}, shaping public perception and
reinforcing the authority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
AI-enhanced [[disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} campaigns manipulate
domestic narratives and influence international media, pushing
pro-Beijing messaging while [[suppress]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
dissenting [[views]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beyond its borders, China's AI
strategy extends into military, economic and geopolitical domains. The
People's Liberation Army (PLA) is rapidly developing AI-powered
autonomous warfare systems, cyberwarfare capabilities and intelligence
analysis tools, making China a key player in modern conflict dynamics.
Meanwhile, China has leveraged AI in the global economy for industrial
automation, supply chain control and financial market manipulation,
positioning itself as a dominant force in semiconductors, rare earth
minerals and digital finance sectors. By integrating AI into the Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing has expanded its digital and economic
influence across developing nations, embedding AI-driven infrastructure
that ensures long-term dependence on Chinese technology. A key case
study within this report examines DeepSeek AI, a sophisticated Chinese
AI system which is capable of manipulating narratives and influencing
public opinion. DeepSeek AI is capable of controlling search engine
results, generating AI-written propaganda and manipulating social media
discussions, ensuring that, when Beijing so wishes, its messaging
dominates the digital space. [[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} has been
able to [[weaponise AI-driven]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[disinformation,]{.underline}]{.mark} which has proven effective in
altering public perception on issues such as Hong Kong. China's AI
ambitions also directly impact global security, particularly in the
Taiwan Strait and Russia--Ukraine conflict. The report details how
[[China employs AI to undermine Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}'s democracy,
[[using cyberwarfare, economic coercion, deepfake disinformation and
AI-assisted military strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} to destabilise the
island nation. Similarly, China has provided AI-driven intelligence
sharing, cyberwarfare tools and economic assistance to Russia's war
effort against Ukraine, strengthening Moscow's ability to evade
sanctions and continue its aggression. China's infiltration into
international organisations through AI-driven influence further cements
its ability to shape global cybersecurity, trade and governance
regulations. By pushing for AI- friendly authoritarian policies in
institutions such as the United Nations (UN), International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and World Economic Forum (WEF), China
seeks to normalise state-led AI governance, expanding its reach over the
digital and economic future of the world. Given the [[profound risks
posed by China's AI]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy, this report outlines
a series of critical recommendations to safeguard democratic values,
economic stability and international security. These recommendations
emphasise the need for ethical AI frameworks, stronger cybersecurity
measures, reduced reliance on Chinese AI technology, countering
AI-driven disinformation, economic defences against AI-enabled market
manipulation and bolstering AI in defence and national security.
Additionally, the report underscores the importance of Western nations
making clear their intent to defend Taiwan militarily, reinforcing
deterrence against Chinese aggression. China's AI strategy represents
one of the greatest threats to democracy, digital freedom and global
stability in the modern era. The e[[xpansion of AI-driven
authoritarianism,]{.underline}]{.mark} disinformation, surveillance,
economic coercion and military advancements [[demands an urgent
response]{.underline}]{.mark} from the international community. Failure
to act could lead to a world where governments manipulate truth, replace
privacy with surveillance and consolidate economic power through
AI-driven coercion. A coordinated and proactive response is essential to
ensuring AI remains a force for innovation, freedom and global security.

## Democracy 

### Democracy Bad\-\--Idiocracy\-\--1NC

#### Democracy's [positive effects]{.underline} are offset by a [short-termist idiocracy]{.underline}. 

Dambisa **Moyo 18**, DPhil in Economics from the University of Oxford,
MPA from Harvard University, MBA and BS from American University, "Why
Democracy Doesn't Deliver", 4-26-18,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/26/why-democracy-doesnt-deliver/

Only 19 percent of Americans today say they can trust their government
to do what is right. Meanwhile, [citizens in developing
countries [see authoritarian leaders as more
trustworthy than democratic politicians]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Increasingly, it seems that [people across the globe are skeptical of
the ability of democratic governments to act
effectively]{.underline} --- including [as good custodians of the
economy]{.underline}. Indeed, the liberal democratic system is
unwittingly undermining the economic growth that is necessary for its
continued survival.

[[At the root]{.underline}]{.mark} of the problem [is a predilection
for short-​termism that has become [embedded in]{.mark}
the political and business [culture of]{.mark} modern democracies.
By design, [Western politicians have]{.mark} relatively [short political horizons]{.mark};
they are often in office for terms of less than five years. So they
find their duties regularly interrupted by elections]{.underline} that
distract from the job of addressing long-​term policy challenges. As a
result, [politicians]{.underline} are naturally
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} rationally drawn to [focus]{.underline} their
efforts [on seducing their
electorates with [short-​term sweeteners]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
including economic policies designed to quickly produce favorable
monthly inflation, unemployment, and GDP numbers.

[Voters]{.underline} generally [favor policies that
enhance]{.underline} their own [well-​being with little consideration
for]{.underline} that of future generations or for [long-​term
outcomes]{.underline}. Politicians are rewarded for pandering to voters'
immediate demands and desires, to the detriment of growth over the long
term. Because democratic systems encourage such short-​termism, [it [will
be difficult to]{.mark} solve]{.underline} many of the
seemingly [intractable [structural problems]{.mark} slowing global
growth]{.underline} without an overhaul of democracy.

[[One of the most fundamental obstacles to effective governance is the
short electoral
cycle]{.underline}]{.mark} embedded [i[n]{.mark}]{.underline} many [[democratic
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. Frequent elections taint policymaking, as
politicians, driven by the rational desire to win elections, opt for
quick fixes that have a tendency to undermine long-term growth.
Meanwhile[, [they neglect to address]{.underline}]{.mark}
[more entrenched, [longer-​term economic challenges, such as worsening
education standards]{.mark}]{.underline}, the imminent pension
crisis, [[and deteriorating physical
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, that don't promise immediate
political rewards.

America's failing infrastructure encapsulates the problem of both public
and private myopia. A 2017 report by the American Society of Civil
Engineers (ASCE) gave the country a grade of D+ for overall
infrastructure, citing 2,170 high-​hazard dams, 56,007 structurally
deficient bridges (9.1 percent of the nation's total), and \$1 trillion
in needed upgrades to drinking water systems over the next 25 years.

At a minimum, the ASCE suggests that a \$2 trillion investment is needed
by 2020 to address the significant backlog of overdue maintenance and
the pressing need for modernization. The effects of increased
infrastructure investment on the prospects of low-​skilled labor could be
substantial. Investing in infrastructure would have all sorts of other
benefits, but the prevailing democratic political system discourages the
sort of long-​term thinking necessary to do so.

Clearly there have been periods in the past when governments have chosen
to undertake large infrastructure projects without succumbing to
political myopia. In the United States, for example, the federal
government drove the rollout of the Work Projects Administration (WPA)
in the 1930s. Launched under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
to help address America's chronic unemployment, the WPA was America's
largest and most ambitious project dedicated to constructing public
buildings, roads, bridges, schools, and courthouses. It was possible
because the short-​term political incentive of reducing mass unemployment
through the rapid creation of jobs aligned with a long-​term agenda.

Today, when it comes to infrastructure, China and India present a useful
study in contrasts. Both countries needed roads to increase
productivity. China built them, but India's infrastructure programs got
bogged down in red tape and political wrangling born of political
fissures in its democratic system. Because vested interests in India
have a stranglehold on policymaking and implementation, India's
democratic processes stifled decisions that could have helped drive
economic growth. In the 2016-2017 World Economic Forum Global
Competitiveness Report, India was ranked 68th of 138 countries for
overall infrastructure, well behind China, which was ranked 42nd. The
effects of underinvestment in infrastructure on the economy are real:
For India, spending 1 percent of GDP on infrastructure is likely to
boost the country's GDP by 2 percent and create as many as 1.4 million
jobs.

[[A second major o]{.mark}bstacle to]{.underline} effective
democratic [governance is [interest group lobbying]{.mark}, a
feature in]{.underline} many liberal [democracies that tends
to [interfere w]{.mark}ith the proper [allocation of
assets]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2016, more than \$3.15 billion was spent
lobbying the U.S. Congress, roughly double the amount spent in
2000. [Across sectors, lobbying]{.underline} by special interest
groups [has a discernible impact on public
policy]{.underline} decisions [in]{.underline} ways that negatively
affect [trade, infrastructure, and]{.underline} ultimately [economic
growth]{.underline}. For example, environmental groups oppose pipelines
and new oil exploration projects, agricultural interests lobby for farm
subsidies, and American trucking interest groups oppose additional tolls
earmarked for road maintenance.

[Political cycles too often keep
[politicians beholden to]{.mark} the individuals and corporate
interests that help fund their campaigns]{.underline} and to the
vagaries of public opinion polling. And because democratic politics
rests on political contributions, it widens the inequality between rich
and poor. It is the use of wealth to influence political outcomes that
helps inequality take root. Until democracies push back on the use of
wealth to influence elections and policies, initiatives to address
inequality will be blunted.

### Democracy Bad\-\--War\-\--1NC

#### Authoritarianism is Good

Natalie **Regoli 19**. Masters from University of Texas, has practiced
law for 18 years. "17 Advantages and Disadvantages of Authoritarian
Government." ConnectUS. 4/24/19.
https://connectusfund.org/8-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-authoritarian-government/.MS

1\. It has the capacity to produce consistent results nationwide.

[Authoritarian leaders work hard to create solutions that benefit
everyone]{.underline} in their working group [because any success that
happens is credited to them]{.underline}. There are [no leadership
voids]{.underline} that take place because this leader can move the
government structures to where they need to be. The directions that are
given by the person in charge can then be implemented to create
measurable results over time.

An [authoritarian government can thrive]{.underline} [when it has the
chance to provide task assignments, create certain deadlines, and
provide control through consistent application]{.underline} across the
country. Even if some the actions are fear-based or potentially
unnecessary, leaders who are seen taking action will often be praised
for their efforts.

2\. It saves time during the decision-making process.

[Authoritarian governments work from a centralized system]{.underline}
where there is one person or a legislative group responsible for the
decisions that get made. Because there are [fewer steps involved in the
process]{.underline} of creating laws or distributing resources, you
will [find faster movement and implementation of ideas]{.underline}
available using this structure. These [leaders do not need to consult
with other people to make their decisions, which is exceptionally useful
in moments when emergency situations arise.]{.underline}

By removing much of the bureaucracy, authoritarian governments seek to
eliminate a lot of the waste that can occur in other governing systems.

3\. It places the pressure of making a choice on the shoulders of the
leader.

The world can be a very stressful place for a variety of reasons. [When
pressure begins to mount on the general population]{.underline}, then
the [authoritarian government can come to the rescue of
society]{.underline}. [This structure]{.underline} works to [put people
into the best possible positions]{.underline} where their strengths can
become an asset to the government. If you want to hold a job and this is
the government option in your country, then [there is an excellent
chance that you will have employment.]{.underline}

#### Democracy creates war

Emily **Velasco 18**. Media relations manager at Caltech. "Democracies
More Prone to Start Wars -- Except When They\'re Not." Caltech. 7/18/18.
https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/democracies-more-prone-start-wars-except-when-theyre-not-82879/.MS

[Leaders of democratic nations actually have stronger incentives to
start and exacerbate conflicts]{.underline} with other countries than
their autocratic counterparts, [suggests a new study published by the
American Journal of Political Science.]{.underline}

The difference boils down to public pressure, say the study\'s authors,
Michael Gibilisco of Caltech and Casey Crisman-Cox of Texas A&M
University. Because of [pressure from voters to not back down and appear
weak, democratic leaders tend to act more aggressively]{.underline} in
international conflicts. [An autocrat,]{.underline} on the other hand[,
is answerable to no one and can back down]{.underline} from a conflict
without facing personal consequences.

\"[If an elected leader makes a threat]{.underline} during a conflict
with another country [and the threat isn\'t followed through,
they]{.underline} may [face a decrease in approval ratings]{.underline},
or they may lose an election,\" says Gibilisco, assistant professor of
political science. In democracies, he notes, [voters can punish their
leaders for appearing weak]{.underline}---these punishments or
consequences are known as \"audience costs\" in political science
parlance. [To avoid those costs, leaders in rep]{.underline}resentative
[governments become more aggressive]{.underline} during disputes.

In their study, Gibilisco and Crisman-Cox, who is also an assistant
professor of political science, first developed a mathematical model of
dispute initiation between countries and then fit the model to data of
actual conflicts that occurred among 125 countries between 1993--2007.

They also estimated audience costs for the countries in their sample
using existing databases containing country-by-country information on
levels of democracy and press freedom. In general, they found that
[audience costs are highest in democracies with strong protections for a
free press]{.underline}.

### Authoritarianism Bad\-\--2AC

#### Authoritarianism causes extinction

Tom **Barnes &** Marie Davidsen **Buhl 21**, Visiting Fellow & Research
Intern at Rethink Priorities, "Towards a longtermist framework for
evaluating democracy-related interventions", 7-28-2021,
https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/towards-a-longtermist-framework-for-evaluating-democracy-related-interventions

[Preventing the risk of societies coming under the control of a single
group/leader, who hold exclusive political power.]{.underline} At its
extreme, [this could include totalitarianism. [Taking preventative
measures to stop democratic backsliding may help to prevent
authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}. What are some ways
[[authoritarianism might affect]{.underline}]{.mark} the long-term
future? [[Existential risk reduction]{.mark}: Malevolent actors (Althaus
and Baumann, 2020) who become [authoritarian leaders]{.mark} may
potentially [inflict astronomical levels of suffering]{.mark}, perhaps
[locking humanity into an]{.mark} undesired or [enforced dystopia,
and]{.mark} potentially [leading humanity into a fate worse than]{.mark}
mere [extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline} An alternative existential risk
may be [that [authoritarian leaders are less competent at dealing with
other x-risks, such as the development of new tech]{.mark}nology. Thus
[authoritarianism may increase existential risk]{.mark}
indirectly.]{.underline} [A further worry is that humanity may never
achieve its full potential -- for instance, [a stable authoritarian
leader could prevent space colonization from
occurring]{.mark}]{.underline}, leaving vast amounts of the galaxy
without value. [[This would also constitute an existential risk via a
failed continuation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Trajectory change: A less
extreme worry may be that authoritarian leaders fail to address certain
sources of disvalue, even if humanity still enjoys a flourishing future.
For example, they may not prevent wild animal suffering on Earth even if
most of the universe is filled with value. What are some ways democracy
might affect authoritarianism? Competitive democracy: [Efforts to
improve competitive democracy make it easier to remove leaders from
power in elections, which can reduce the risk of authoritarianism
arising.]{.underline} Responsiveness & accuracy: The extent to which
increasing these features makes authoritarianism more or less likely
depends on the preferences of voters. For example, if voters tend to
prefer non-authoritarian leaders, then increasing how well the political
system responds and reflects voters' preferences makes authoritarianism
less likely. Conversely, if voters prefer more authoritarian leaders,
then adjusting the political system to accommodate for this makes higher
responsiveness/accuracy more likely to bring about authoritarianism. It
seems likely that, on average, most [[democratic citizens would prefer
less]{.mark} rather than more [authoritarianism in their political
system]{.mark}]{.underline} (however, this is very context-dependent).
Participation[: Countries with high levels of participation seem more
likely and better able to challenge an authoritarian leader, compared to
where apathy is high or participation is curtailed.]{.underline}
Additionally, because authoritarian regimes may try to limit
participation, means of keeping participation high once an authoritarian
first gains power could be an especially important way to prevent
authoritarianism from being locked in. Liberalism: Authoritarianism and
liberalism are almost polar opposites -- societies high in liberalism
are far less likely to see an authoritarian rise to power. For example,
because liberalism safeguards pluralism, multiple value systems and
beliefs are allowed to co-exist, whereas authoritarian regimes tend to
exclude values that deviate from orthodoxy. Voter competence:
[[Democracies with low levels of well-informed voters]{.mark} may be
[more susceptible to polarisation and populism, which can]{.mark} in
turn [be a driver of electing authoritarian leaders]{.mark}. Thus,
efforts to increase voter competence may reduce the likelihood of
authoritarianism.]{.underline}

#### Authoritarian governments have negative impacts on society

Garry **Kasparov** and Thor **Halvorssen 17**. chairman of the New
York-based Human Rights Foundation and foundation's president and chief
executive. "Why the rise of authoritarianism is a global catastrophe."
The Washington Post. 2/13/17.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/02/13/why-the-rise-of-authoritarianism-is-a-global-catastrophe/

Last month the world's elite listened politely as [[Chinese President Xi
Jinping]{.underline}]{.mark} offered the keynote address at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Of course, the leader of the
Chinese dictatorship didn't mention how he and his cronies jail and
disappear human rights activists, [[**persecute** ethnic minorities and
religious groups, and operate a vast censorship and surveillance system,
among other evils]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is striking that a forum
dedicated to "improving the state of the world" would offer such an
important stage to the leader of a repressive regime. Xi began his
remarks in part by asking "What has gone wrong with the world?" The fact
is, he's part of the problem.

At present, the authoritarianism business is booming. According to the
Human Rights Foundation's research, the citizens of 94 countries suffer
under non-democratic regimes, meaning that [3.97 billion people are
currently controlled by tyrants, absolute monarchs, military juntas or
competitive authoritarian]{.underline}s. That's 53 percent of the
world's population. Statistically, then, [[authoritarianism
is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the largest --- if not the
[[largest]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [**[challenges facing
humanity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Consider the scale of some of the world's other crises. About 836
million live under extreme poverty, and 783 million lack clean drinking
water. War and conflict have displaced 65 million from their homes.
Between 1994 and 2013 an annual average of 218 million people were
affected by natural disasters. These are terrible, seemingly intractable
problems --- but at least there are United Nations bodies, aid
organizations and State Department teams dedicated to each one of them.

Dictators and elected authoritarians, by contrast, get a free pass. The
World Bank bails out repressive regimes on a regular basis. There is no
anti-tyrant U.N. task force, no Sustainable Development Goals against
tyranny, no army of activists.

We, the authors, have experienced the ills of authoritarianism
personally. One of us has been beaten, blacklisted and forced into exile
by operatives of the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin has
relentlessly pushed to crush freedom of speech, brazenly annex Crimea
and increase his global military activities in ways that hark back to
the Cold War. The other author has seen his mother shot by Venezuelan
security forces and his first cousin languish for nearly three years in
a military jail as a prisoner of conscience. Today [[Venezuelan
President Nicolás Maduro runs a regime that regularly imprisons
dissidents, abuses protesters and engages in]{.underline}]{.mark} such
[[widespread graft and corruption]{.underline}]{.mark} that the country
is now undergoing a catastrophic economic collapse.

Putin and Maduro have co-conspirators in all parts of the world, fellow
would-be tyrants who are dismantling the free press, jailing opponents,
manipulating elections and committing a host of human rights violations.
In Turkey, a once-promising democracy is gasping for air. Its president,
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has shut down 149 media outlets, shuttered more
than 2,000 schools and universities, fired more than 120,000 civil
servants and jailed more than 45,000 suspected dissenters. In North
Korea, [[Kim Jong Un]{.mark}]{.underline} rules the most totalitarian
government on Earth, **[[brainwash]{.mark}i]{.underline}**ng [[25
million people and terrorizing them with public executions, forced
famines and a vast network of concentration camps]{.underline}]{.mark}
that reminded U.N. investigators of Pol Pot's Cambodia and Nazi Germany.

And there are so many lesser-known dictators in countries such as
Bahrain, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea, where tyrants pilfer their
countries' natural resources and pocket the profits in private off-shore
accounts. To cover their atrocities, they hire lobbyists, public
relations firms and even policy groups in the free world to whitewash
their actions.

If injustice and oppression aren't bad enough[, [authoritarian
government]{.underline}]{.mark}s bear an enormous social cost.
Dictator-led [c[ountries have higher rates of mental illness, lower
levels of health and life expectancy]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Amartya Sen famously argued, higher
susceptibility to famine. Their [[citizens are less
educated]{.underline}]{.mark} and file fewer patents. In 2016, more
patents were filed in France than in the entire Arab world --- not
because Arabs are less entrepreneurial than the French, but because
nearly all of them live under stifling authoritarianism. Clearly, the
[[**suppression** of free expression and creativity has harmful effects
on innovation and economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. Citizens of free
and open societies such as Germany, South Korea and Chile witness
advances in business, science and technology that Belarusans, Burmese
and Cubans can only dream of.

And consider that free nations do not go to war with each other. History
has shown this to be the only ironclad law of political theory.
Meanwhile, [[dictators]{.mark} are [always at war]{.mark}]{.underline},
often [with a foreign power and always with their own
people]{.underline}. If you are worried about public health, poverty or
peace, your mandate is clear: Oppose tyranny.

Tragically, world institutions and organizations have failed to properly
address authoritarianism. Western governments sometimes protest human
rights violations in countries such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea ---
but routinely ignore them in places such as China and Saudi Arabia, in
favor of upholding trade deals and security agreements. The United
Nations, established to bring peace and justice to the world, includes
Cuba, Egypt and Rwanda on its Human Rights Council. Here, a
representative from a democracy carries the same legitimacy as a
representative from a dictatorship. One acts on behalf of its citizens,
while the other acts to silence them. Between June 2006 and August 2015
the Human Rights Council issued zero condemnations of repressive regimes
in China, Cuba, Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

Despite the fact that [[dictatorship is]{.underline}]{.mark} at the
[[root of]{.underline}]{.mark} many global ills --- [[poor health,
failing education systems and global poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} among
them --- [authoritarianism is hardly ever addressed at major conferences
worldwide]{.underline}. And no wonder: Many, including the World
Economic Forum and the now-defunct Clinton Global Initiative, receive
ample funding from authoritarians. Few human rights groups focus
exclusively on authoritarianism, and most establishment ones spend
significant chunks of their budgets on criticizing democratic
governments and their policies. Dictators are rarely in the spotlight.

The noble struggle against tyranny has fallen upon individual activists
and dissidents living under authoritarian rule or working from exile.
Citizen journalists Abdalaziz Alhamza and Meron Estefanos found that few
people in peaceful, free countries were interested in reporting on Syria
and Eritrea, so they took it upon themselves to do so, despite the
enormous danger this put them in. Hyeonseo Lee defected from North Korea
to find that victims of sex trafficking in China are often abandoned and
ignored, so she started pressuring the Chinese government herself. When
Rosa María Payá's father, Cuban democracy leader Oswaldo Payá, died in
mysterious circumstances in 2012, it fell to her to demand a formal
investigation and fair treatment for dissidents in Cuba. Such
individuals are in constant need of support, because in their home
countries there is no legal way to protest, no ACLU, no Washington Post
and no opposition party to stand up for their rights.

If authoritarianism and dictatorship are to be properly challenged ---
and if so many resulting crises, including military conflict, poverty
and extremism, are to be addressed at their root cause --- such
dissidents need funding, strategic advice, technical training, attention
and solidarity. To turn the tide against repression, people across all
industries need to join the movement. Artists, entrepreneurs,
technologists, investors, diplomats, students --- no matter who you are,
you can reach out to a civil society organization at risk and ask how
you can help by using your knowledge, resources or skills.

[[Today, authoritarians rule an **increasingly large part** of the
globe]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the leaders of the free world lack the
motivation and gumption to create a new U.N.-style League of
Democracies. In the meantime, as individuals living in a free society,
we believe it is our moral obligation to take action to expose human
rights violations and to use our freedom to help others achieve theirs.

#### Recession is [inevitable]{.underline}. Tariffs, the OBBB, and rates.

[America could be on the **cusp of an economic downturn**, thanks to the
self---defeating, destructive policies of]{.underline} president Donald
[Trump. [**Inflation is rising while the dollar is falling,** and
Trump's]{.mark} just-passed One [Big Beautiful Bil]{.mark}l Act is
projected to [add]{.mark} a whopping [\$3.4 trillion to]{.mark} the
**[federal deficit]{.mark}**. Add to this]{.underline} [the uncertainty
caused by Trump's tariffs]{.underline} and immigration policies, along
with his threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

The result, says economist Robert Shapiro, is that [[the United States
economy has become dangerously unstable and vulnerable to financial
shocks]{.underline}.]{.mark} Shapiro spoke with Senior Editor Anne Kim
for the Washington Monthly podcast. This transcript has been edited for
length and clarity.

\*\*\*

Anne Kim:

You were on the show a few months back, actually at the start of the
Trump administration. And in fact, you were one of our very first
guests, so thank you very much for returning!

I want to ask you first about your most recent piece for the Monthly,
titled Trump's Budget Could Break the Economy, which sounds pretty dire.
And you conclude that "for once, the deficit hawks are right." I take it
that you haven't always been one of those deficit hawks in the past, so
what has changed in your mind? What is in the "One Big Beautiful Bill
Act" that worries you so much?

Robert Shapiro:

[[Deficits]{.mark} that [are]{.mark} equivalent to [7% of
GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}---that's what bothers me. For some perspective,
[in the 1990s, the deficit averaged about 2% of GDP. From 2000 to 2007,
it was 1.2% of GDP. Through Trump's first term, it averaged 3.6% of
GDP.]{.underline}

[We are now at [**double the highest rate** we've seen]{.mark} in a
non---recessionary year in our history since World War II.
The]{.underline} problem is that [deficits have to be funded by
somebody's savings---they can't be funded by consumption. American
households save about 4 or 4.1% of their total disposable income.
Businesses save through retained earnings, which is about 3% or
3.6%]{.underline}, I believe. [All annual savings in the U.S. economy
comes to 7.7% of GDP, and if the Treasury is claiming 7% of GDP, that
means there's nothing left for business investment, mortgages, car
loans, or very little---and interest rates spike.]{.underline}

However, we don't only depend on domestic savings. [We live in a global
economy, and foreign governments and investors invest in our securities
and our economy.]{.underline}

Right now, [**[foreign]{.mark}** investors and [**governments** own 33%
of]{.mark} our [national debt]{.mark}]{.underline} in Treasury
securities. T[hey also own 30% of all corporate debt and 27% of all U.S.
stocks on all exchanges. So this is how dependent we are on foreign
investors.]{.underline}

It means [we are totally dependent on foreign investors to fund business
investment, car loans, mortgages, credit card debt---all debt. [If those
countries Trump is trying to punish with tariffs call his bluff, all
they have to do is significantly slow]{.mark} their [purchases]{.mark}.
That will [send interest rates across the board]{.mark} substantially
higher, [slowing the economy. ]{.mark}]{.underline}

And [[if they were to stop buying]{.mark} U.S. [securities]{.mark}, the
[U.S. economy would **crash**]{.mark} because interest rates would
**skyrocket**]{.underline}. That's where we are. It's just the numbers.
This is not an interpretation.

Anne Kim:

Can you explain why slowing sales or an outright stoppage of Treasury
securities purchases will cause interest rates to spike? My
understanding is that have to pay interest when people borrow money from
us. And when people aren't buying, we have to continue raising interest
rates in order to entice more people in with higher yields. Is that
what's going on?

Robert Shapiro:

Yes. That is exactly what will go on. If, say, China were to say, "We're
not going to buy any more Treasury securities this year," then in order
to attract other foreign investors, we'd have to raise interest rates to
make it worth their while.

There are other economic consequences ---the value of the dollar, for
instance. [Normally when interest rates go up, the value of the **dollar
goes up**. That has not happened. [The value of the dollar has **fallen
20%**]{.mark} against the trade---weighted currency basket since Trump
took office.]{.underline}

That means [foreign investors are losing interest]{.underline}---mainly
in investing in corporate paper and stocks. We haven't seen that fully
in the stock market yet, though we did once. [[Japan]{.mark}, for about
a week, [said, "We're not going to invest in the U.S]{.mark}." in
response to tariffs. [The stock market lost thousands]{.mark} of
points.]{.underline}

This is not something you take risks with. We are talking about the
fundamental stability of the U.S. economy. In the worst---case---but
clearly plausible---scenario, we will have our third financial crisis in
18 years.

Anne Kim:

I also read somewhere that [the interest on the debt alone is more than
what we spend on the U.S. military or the federal share of
Medicaid.]{.underline} So it's already an enormous amount of the federal
budget and only going to get even bigger.

Robert Shapiro:

[We pay a **trillion dollars a year** in interest. And we find ourselves
in a period where interest on the debt is compounding at a fast rate,
because both the budget deficit and the interest are growing faster than
the economy.]{.underline}

Anne Kim:

[And this is interest going to countries like China, Japan, the
UK---whoever holds our debt.]{.underline}

Robert Shapiro:

Yes. [One---third of that interest is going abroad. We are sending over
\$**300 billion in interest abroad**---that's more than our trade
deficit with China.]{.underline}

Trump doesn't understand how economies operate. He only wants to hear
affirmation of what he already believes. That's why respected economists
and finance people are saying nonsense on TV about tariffs and
inflation.

The only thing that will correct this policy is when the costs become a
huge political issue.

[[The U.S. has always depended on]{.mark} the kindness of [strangers to
finance investment]{.mark} and deficits.]{.underline} Maybe foreign
countries will give us slack because they don't want to take enormous
losses if the U.S. economy crashes. But [[Trump is attacking]{.mark}
those [countries politically and economically,]{.mark} so if they don't
give us slack, we pay a terrible price. The first casualty of spiking
interest rates is employment and income.]{.underline}

So this is not simply about what the yield curve shows. I think
everybody is kind of living right now in a fool's paradise because the
deficit hawks have always been wrong before.

Anne Kim:

You mentioned the Fed, and I want to ask about that in a bit. But let's
turn to other threats to the economy. We've talked about the deficit,
we've talked about the falling dollar. When you were on the show a few
months back, you also talked about some inflationary pressures posed by
the tariffs, but also Trump's immigration policies. So what is your
thinking now, six months into the administration?

Robert Shapiro:

Well, we had seen [inflation steadily move down---and it stopped moving
down and has begun to move up.]{.underline} We have not seen the full
brunt of the tariffs and inflation for two reasons.

One is that lots of businesses stockpiled inventories. Half of our
imports are inputs for U.S. manufacturing, and the other half are
finished goods and services. You can't stockpile services, but you can
stockpile everything else. The other reason is that companies---large
companies, particularly those dealing in big---ticket items like
autos---have been reluctant to raise prices, despite high tariffs on
cars and auto parts throughout this period. That's because of
TACO---that is, Trump always changing his mind---because he has gone
back and forth so many times on tariffs. Companies like Ford or BMW that
make cars in the U.S. have been reluctant to alienate customers by
raising prices until they see the final lay of the land. But that's
running out. The inventories are running out. And it's become clear that
we will have substantially higher tariffs. Before Trump, we had an
average 2% tariff rate. We are now at 15 to 20%. Anne Kim: Right. So for
example, the latest so---called "agreement" with Japan sets a baseline
of 15%, which the Trump administration is spinning as a victory. But the
original tariff rate was a lot lower, right? Robert Shapiro: Yes, the
original tariff rate with Japan was about 3%. So it's five times higher.
We haven't seen the details yet. The largest---selling auto company in
the United States is Toyota, and most of those cars are made in the
U.S.---but with parts made in Mexico, Canada, Japan, and elsewhere. We
don't know yet what the new tariff rate will be on those parts. And this
is not a "deal." It's an agreement to continue to negotiate. We haven't
seen the full impact yet. As for deportations---we are beginning to see
increases in the cost of domestically produced fruits and vegetables.
We're also seeing this in construction. The largest number and share of
undocumented immigrants is in construction. Second is personal services.
Agriculture is actually fourth or fifth. Some people are being deported,
but a lot of other people are staying away from jobs out of fear that
ICE will find them. And it's not just unauthorized immigrants---this
campaign doesn't distinguish between authorized and unauthorized. It
arrests people based almost entirely on racial profiling. Anne Kim: He's
also converting authorized immigrants into unauthorized ones by revoking
temporary protected status, for instance, and threatening to revoke
visas for others. Robert Shapiro: Right. So we will continue to see some
cost---push inflation from employment. Look, we're still creating net
new jobs---but at a significantly slower rate than last year. So we are
seeing some impact on employment. There are very few things that
virtually all economists agree on. The destructiveness of tariffs for
both sides is one. It's the only thing that Adam Smith and Karl Marx
agreed on. The only thing that John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek
agreed on. I certainly know that Adam Smith was a supporter of
immigration. Why? Because growth equals increases in employment times
productivity increases. That's the formula. Smith, Keynes, Hayek, Marx,
John Stuart Mill, Milton Friedman---all agreed on that. Anne Kim: But
not Trump. So I want to ask---as if we didn't have enough nails in this
coffin---about one more, and that is the independence of the Fed and the
threats to it. Rob, you were a senior official in the Clinton
administration. You've dealt with presidents and Fed officials. But have
you ever seen anything like the threats Trump has leveled against
Chairman Powell? Robert Shapiro: No, we've never seen anything like
this---except by Trump in his first term, when he attacked Janet Yellen,
and later when he attacked Jerome Powell. Trump has this notion that if
you cut interest rates, growth will increase. That's true---unless you
have significant inflationary pressures and a strong economy. Right now
we have a weak economy. The first quarter contracted after growing at a
2.8% rate in the last quarter of the last administration. Biden may have
gotten some things wrong, but he didn't get the economy wrong. Under
those conditions, no Fed chair who cares about their reputation would
cut rates. What Trump is doing is making the Fed chair a poisoned
chalice for whoever he nominates. The markets are going to assume the
Fed won't be independent. He'll nominate a loyalist---maybe \[Treasury
Secretary Scott\] Bessent, \[National Economic Council Director\] Kevin
Hassett, or someone else we're not even looking at. And the markets will
assume that person won't be independent. I think you'll get a negative
response to virtually anyone he names. You'll see that response start to
kick in as we approach the nomination. The markets will build in the
expectation that policy will be inflationary. So even before the Fed
does anything, there will be upward pressure on interest rates---and
downward pressure on employment and incomes and growth. Anne Kim: And
that brings us back full circle---meaning that foreign investors will
have one more reason to lose confidence in the US economy, which will
have ripple effects throughout the economy. Robert Shapiro: Right. It
all feeds into the deficit---based pressures on interest rates and the
economy. This is an economy that runs on credit. That's why we're big.
That's why we're rich. Trump seems to believe that by force of will, he
can mold reality. And that's true in the response of the people around
him. He governs by threat and intimidation. But it's the responsibility
of mature leadership to step back and say, "I have to govern in the
interests of the country based on evidence." That's patriotism. That's
something Trump---and sadly, those around him---don't seem to understand
or care about.

Anne Kim:

I have one final question: [Do you think what's going to happen with the
U.S. economy is a slow downturn like a balloon losing air, or are we
going to see a crash?]{.underline}

Robert Shapiro:

[It's predictable in a general sense. **Crashes require shocks**. A
shock destabilizes the economy because it's not expected, and so
individuals and businesses don't prepare. A shock creates enormous
uncertainty.]{.underline}

The example I like is the difference between Lehman Brothers and General
Motors. They both went bankrupt. One destabilized the global economy.
The other didn't---because we saw it coming and prepared.

What I've been writing about is the potential shock from the difficulty
of financing the deficit. [[If]{.mark} our big [foreign lenders
lose]{.mark} [patience]{.mark}, or need to take a stand for their own
political reasons, [we could see]{.mark} something like
2008---2009.]{.underline}

[If not, then we get something like 1981---1982: [a very **serious
recession**]{.mark}, or a less serious one, [followed **by years** of
higher inflation and higher interest rates.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Our base case[: we [anticipate a recession]{.mark} in the US and Europe,
[starting later this year]{.mark} or early next year.]{.underline}

In the short term the economic data looks relatively benign. While
purchasing managers' indices for the US, the euro zone, UK and China are
all weakening, they do not yet signal an imminent recession. Meanwhile,
headline inflation for the first three economies is easing more quickly
than expected. Looking at these factors in the round, investors may be
forgiven for thinking the major economies may be able to avoid
recession. This, at least in part, accounts for this year's strength in
equity markets and relative stability in bond yields. [More recent
market moves have undone some of the gains in equities and pushed yields
on long-term US government debt to multi-year highs.]{.underline}

[We think **[caution may be warranted]{.mark}**. The global economy is
navigating a delicate balance between near-term strength and increasing
fragility in the medium term.]{.underline}

Price pressures may have eased but annualized core inflation remains
significantly above central banks' targets of 2%. [Headline inflation
could also stabilise higher due to the impact of the Ukraine war and the
El Niño climate pattern, among other factors, on food and energy
supplies.]{.underline} Central banks will want to see solid evidence of
slowing price increases before they ease back on interest rates. Money
markets have been ruling out the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve
(Fed) raising rates beyond the current level of 5.25% to 5.50%, before
lowering to 4% within the next two years. We see the former as a
possible scenario but think markets may start to price in less rate cuts
in 2024 before a slowdown emerges. [[Policymakers will hope]{.mark}
that, by keeping rates higher for longer, they can [engineer a]{.mark}
so-called [**soft landing** whereby]{.mark} inflation sustainably
returns to target and [the econ]{.mark}omy [survives]{.mark} relatively
[unscathed]{.mark}. In practice, [this outcome is]{.mark} likely to
prove **[extremely difficult]{.mark}**.]{.underline} History provides
few consolations: whenever central banks have raised rates to high
levels to fight inflation, the outcome is almost always a recession.

[It can be helpful to [think of recession as a]{.mark} pressure [relief
valve that **reduces** ]{.mark}**the risk of [economies
overheating]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Importantly for investors, it could
create conditions for a revival in risky assets.

#### Also [strengthen]{.underline} the world economy and reduce dependence on autocracies

**The Economist** 20**22** \[The Economist, \"The silver linings of a
recession\", Economist,
https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/27/the-silver-linings-of-a-recession,
7-30-2022, MK\]

Regardless of whether economies are already shrinking[, it is **hard to
see how they can avoid a [recession]{.mark}** over the next year as
monetary tightening bites and Europe heads into a bleak winter. The
silver lining is that both higher interest rates and the energy shock
[will]{.mark} bring gains that should **[strengthen the world
economy]{.mark}** in the long run.]{.underline}

Some recessions feed on themselves as indebted households cut their
spending or defaults cascade through a fragile financial system. With a
few exceptions, such as Canada's frothy housing market, today's big
economies suffer from few such vulnerabilities. In fact, households and
companies look strong.

The bank balances of the poorest American households are around 70%
fatter than they were in 2019. Even the threat of an emerging-market
financial crisis---the usual worry when the Fed raises rates---is not
what it once was. That is in part because of a switch towards debts
denominated in local currencies rather than dollars.

The main global economic fault line is inflation. Thankfully, it is
still short in the tooth. The last time the Fed tightened monetary
policy so dramatically, in the early 1980s, prices had more than doubled
over the previous decade. Today the figure is just 29%, because
inflation only took off last year[. Though [America's economy has
**badly overheated**]{.mark}, long-term inflation expectations remain
modest.]{.underline} The best historical analogy is probably not the
prolonged battle with stagflation of the 1970s but the burst in consumer
prices that followed the mass disruption of the second world war. The
downturn that brought that inflation to an end was shallow and left few
scars. [A mild [recession should squeeze price rises out of the
economy]{.mark} this time, too. [Already, markets are betting
that]{.mark} American [prices will rise by about 3.8%]{.mark} over the
next year, [**less than half the current** **inflation
rate**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[Elsewhere the main impetus for inflation is soaring global food and
energy prices and disrupted supply chains, which are raising the price
of imported goods. Some shortages are already easing. Wheat prices are
down by nearly 40% from their recent peak in May. Oil prices have also
been falling lately. **Supply chains are recovering**.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, Europe's gas shortage is getting worse. Though
governments are doing their best to shield consumers from the
consequences, if rationing becomes necessary, industrial production and
hence gdp will fall, perhaps steeply in exposed economies like Germany.
Even as output shrinks, inflation will rise further.

[Yet in the same way that [a downturn should purge the American economy
of its inflation problem]{.mark}, so [Europe could emerge from
recession]{.mark} having [overcome]{.mark} its [complacency]{.mark}
about the supply [of energy. Policymakers have]{.mark} belatedly
[realised]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} carefully managed [shift]{.mark} to
clean energy [**also eases their dependence on autocratic**
**regimes**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Around the world, investment in renewable energy is surging and
governments that were previously sceptical about nuclear power---an
essential part of a low-carbon energy grid---are reconsidering their
opposition to it. Even Japan, which suffered the Fukushima disaster in
2011, is hoping to restart more nuclear reactors. [If the world emerges
from the coming downturn with inflation under control and on the path to
greener, more secure energy supplies, the pain will **not have been for
nothing**.]{.underline}

#### Economic Decline Bad

**Harvard 16**. A school of public health that researches to save lives.
"Failing Economy, Failing Health" 08/10/2016
https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/failing-economy-failing-health/

There has long been [**substantial** evidence linking **job loss** to
**shorter lives** and more health-related problems.]{.underline} A 2009
study on the impact of the 1980s oil crisis and subsequent recession in
Pennsylvania, published by economists Daniel Sullivan and Till von
Wachter in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, found that [in the year
after men lost their jobs in mass layoffs, their chances of dying
**doubled**]{.underline}. And though the heightened risk tapered off
over the years, it was still significantly higher 20 years later. If
such trends were sustained indefinitely, the authors wrote, [it would
mean a **loss** in life expectancy of **1--1.5 years** for a worker
displaced at age 40]{.underline}. Today, a new generation of researchers
is building on this scientific foundation. Sociologist Clemens Noelke,
David E. Bell Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard Center for Population
and Development Studies (Pop Center), is in the final stretch of a study
of the health impact of job loss during recessions and the extent to
which unemployment benefits may cushion potential harms. Noelke's
research, which draws on data from a massive biannual study, focuses on
U.S. workers ages 50 and older between 1992 and 2010---years that
include the downturns of the early 1990s and the early 2000s, as well as
the Great Recession (2007--2009). Among the health indicators he is
looking at: [**mortality rates**, cardiovascular disease, cognition,
depression, and unhealthy behaviors]{.underline} such as smoking and
drinking. Although joblessness has been a major problem in Europe, [the
unemployed face special challenges in the United States.]{.underline}
["Earnings loss because of job loss seems to be **larger** in the United
States, because after unemployment benefits run out, people are often
forced to take jobs that don't match well with their
skills,]{.underline} Why target an older population? "[It's **harder**
for an **older** person to find a new job, and older individuals have
**more health conditions** to begin with,"]{.underline} Noelke explains.
"They're also becoming [a **larger proportion** of the
workforce.]{.underline}" By 2016, one-third of the U.S. workforce will
be age 50 and up. While Noelke is not yet talking publicly in detail
about his findings (currently under peer review), he expects the results
to be in line with existing studies from European countries and the U.S.
The studies have consistently tied unemployment to elevated death rates.
A 2011 meta-analysis of international research---published in Social
Science & Medicine by David Roelfs, Eran Shor, Karina Davidson, and
Joseph Schwartz---found that the [risk of death was **63 percent
higher** during the study periods among those who experienced
unemployment than among those who did not,]{.underline} after adjusting
for age and other variables. Some argue that this can be explained by
the fact that sicker people are more likely to end up unemployed. But
studies focusing on workplace closures---where all employees are let
go---suggest otherwise. A 2009 report by University of Albany
sociologist Kate W. Strully in the journal Demography found that [losing
a job when a business closes **increased** the odds of fair or **poor**
health by **54 percent** among workers with no preexisting health
conditions, and **increased by 83** percent the odds of **new health
conditions** likely triggered by job loss]{.underline}---stress-related
conditions such as stroke, hypertension, heart disease, arthritis,
diabetes, and emotional and psychiatric problems. Such findings would
come as no surprise to those who responded to a 2010 poll, conducted
jointly by Knowledge Networks and investigators at HSPH led by Gillian
SteelFisher, a research scientist in the Department of Health Policy and
Management. The survey found that many people with heart disease,
diabetes, or cancer believed that the downturn was hurting their health
and that these negative impacts would only worsen over time. Among the
facts unearthed by the poll: [About a third of those with heart disease
or diabetes and a fifth of those with cancer blame the **economic
downturn** for **forcing** them to use up their **savings** to deal with
**medical bills**, co-payments, and other **expenses** related to their
illnesses.]{.underline} More broadly, according to the poll, some 4 in
10 Americans with heart disease or diabetes and 1 in 5 with cancer said
the [**downturn** had made it **more stressful** for them to manage
their illnesses, a scenario that in itself may have exacerbated existing
health problems.]{.underline} CASCADE OF CATASTROPHE [The United States
is **unique** among developed countries in its historic reliance on
**employers to provide** health insurance]{.underline}---leaving [those
who lose their jobs not only **without** an **income** but also without
**health care.**]{.underline} While passage of the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) in 2010 set the stage for a different scenario, it is not yet
clear that the law will result in better health outcomes for the
unemployed or underemployed. Katherine Baicker, professor of health
economics, co-authored a 2011 paper published by the National Bureau of
Economic Research that showed that the improved access to Medicaid
resulting from the act raised rather than cut costs; yet while the price
of care increased, people reported better health and fewer financial
strains associated with health care costs. The United States is unique
among developed countries in its historic reliance on employers to
provide health insurance---leaving those who lose their jobs not only
without an income but also without health care. Although joblessness has
been a major problem in Europe, the unemployed face special challenges
in the United States. "Earnings loss because of job loss seems to be
larger in the United States, because after unemployment benefits run
out, people are often forced to take jobs that don't match well with
their skills," says Noelke.

#### The next economic crisis will lead to global conflict -- extinction. 

Qian **Liu** 20**18** \[Qian Liu, Managing Director of the Economist
Group and PhD in Economics, \"The next economic crisis could cause a
global conflict. Here\'s why\", World Economic Forum,

11-13-2018, MK\]

[[The **next economic crisis** is close]{.mark}r than you think.
[But]{.mark} what you should really [worry about]{.mark} is [what comes
after:]{.mark} in the current social, political, and technological
landscape, a prolonged economic crisis, combined with rising income
inequality, could well escalate into [a **major global military
conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 2008-09 global financial crisis
almost bankrupted governments and caused systemic collapse. Policymakers
managed to pull the global economy back from the brink, using massive
monetary stimulus, including quantitative easing and near-zero (or even
negative) interest rates. [But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline
shot to jump-start an arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it
does nothing to cure the disease. Treating a sick economy requires
structural reforms, which can cover everything from financial and labor
markets to tax systems, fertility patterns, and education policies.
Policymakers have utterly **failed to pursue such reforms**, despite
promising to do so.]{.underline} Instead, they have remained preoccupied
with politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments
now seems to take more time than actual governing. And Greece, for
example, has relied on money from international creditors to keep its
head (barely) above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension
system or improving its business environment. The lack of structural
reform has meant that the unprecedented excess liquidity that central
banks injected into their economies was not allocated to its most
efficient uses. Instead, it raised global asset prices to levels even
higher than those prevailing before 2008. In the United States, housing
prices are now 8% higher than they were at the peak of the property
bubble in 2006, according to the property website Zillow[. [The]{.mark}
price-to-earnings ([CAPE]{.mark}) [ratio]{.mark}, which measures whether
stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, [is]{.mark} now
[higher than]{.mark} it was both in 2008 and at [the start of the Great
Depression]{.mark} in 1929. As monetary tightening reveals the
**vulnerabilities in the real economy**, [the collapse of asset-price
bubbles will trigger another economic crisis]{.mark} -- one that [could
be even more severe than the last, because we have]{.mark} built up a
tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. A decade of
regular adrenaline shots, in the form of ultra-low interest rates and
unconventional monetary policies, has severely [depleted]{.mark} their
[power to stabilize and stimulate the economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} If
history is any guide, the consequences of this mistake could extend far
beyond the economy. According to Harvard's Benjamin Friedman, prolonged
periods of economic distress have been characterized also by public
antipathy toward minority groups or foreign countries -- attitudes that
can help to fuel unrest, terrorism, or even war. For example, during the
Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover signed the 1930
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, intended to protect American workers and
farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five years, global
trade shrank by two-thirds. Within a decade, World War II had begun. To
be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of factors;
there is no standard path to war. [But there is reason to believe that
high levels of inequality can play a significant role in stoking
conflict. According to research by the economist Thomas Piketty, a
**spike in income inequality is often followed by a great
crisis**]{.underline}. Income inequality then declines for a while,
before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new disaster. Though
causality has yet to be proven, given the limited number of data points,
[this correlation should not be taken lightly, especially with wealth
and income inequality at **historically high levels**. This is all the
more worrying [in view of the numerous]{.mark} other [factors
stoking]{.mark} social unrest and [diplomatic tension, including]{.mark}
technological disruption, a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety
over [globalization, political polarization, and rising
nationalism]{.mark}. All are symptoms of failed policies that [could
turn out to be **trigger points for a future
crisis**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Voters have good reason to be frustrated,
but the emotionally appealing populists to whom they are increasingly
giving their support are offering ill-advised solutions that will only
make matters worse. For example, despite the world's unprecedented
interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed, as
countries -- most notably, Donald Trump's US -- pursue unilateral,
isolationist policies. Meanwhile, proxy wars are raging in Syria and
Yemen[. Against this background, we must take seriously the possibility
that [the next economic crisis]{.mark} could [lead to a **large-scale
military confrontation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} By the
[logic](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Clash-of-Civilizations-and-the-Remaking-of-World-Order/Samuel-P-Huntington/9781451628975)
of the political scientist Samuel Huntington , considering such a
scenario could help us avoid it, because it would force us to take
action. In this case, the key will be for policymakers to pursue the
structural reforms that they have long promised, while replacing
finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible and respectful global
dialogue. [The alternative may well be **global
conflagration**.]{.underline}

[[Russia and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates have [started a
**game of chicken**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic [[that could lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark} an unnecessary **[[military
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Russians have asserted unilateral
control over the Northern Sea Route, an international waterway running
along Russia's northern coast, and are deploying military assets at
chokepoints along the route. [U.S. officials]{.underline} dispute
Russia's claim to the Northern Sea Route and have [threatened to
send]{.underline} U.S. naval vessels in a Freedom of Navigation
Operation ([[FONOP]{.underline}]{.mark}). U.S. Secretary of the Navy
Richard Spencer has spoken of "having some ships make the transit in the
Arctic. Freedom of navigation should be applied up there." These
sentiments were echoed by General Curtis Scaparrotti, former supreme
allied commander in Europe, in congressional testimony, suggesting that
an Arctic FONOP would be aimed at Russia. In May, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo warned, "We're concerned about Russia's claim over the
international waters of the Northern Sea Route." The Department of
Defense's unclassified June 2019 Arctic Strategy stated that U.S.
interests in the Arctic included "ensuring freedom of navigation and
overflight" and called out Russia as a threat in the Arctic. Conducting
an Arctic FONOP is a bad idea. In the short run, it is likely to result
in disaster given inadequate U.S. icebreaking capabilities. It
[[could]{.mark} also [trigger]{.mark} a **military
[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[given Russian]{.mark} **vital
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region [[and their **military
advantages**]{.mark} along the route]{.underline}. Even if the United
States could redress those imbalances in the medium-term, it should
still resist the FONOP idea. Successfully [[traversing the
**N**]{.mark}orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**oute [could lead
to]{.mark} even [**more assertive** Russian
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}, will not make shipping companies any more
likely to resist Russian demands, and [[will damage **U.S-Canadian
relations**]{.mark} by [setting a]{.mark} **dangerous
[precedent]{.mark}** for the contested Northwest Passage]{.underline}.
Instead of a short-term FONOP, the United States should promote a
longer-term counter-narrative that emphasizes innocent passage in Arctic
waters, watches for (and exploits) divergent Sino-Russian Arctic
priorities, and builds the capabilities necessary to manage Alaskan
waters and support NATO allies in the Arctic. The Importance of the
Northern Sea Route The Arctic's climate has not been this hot in 10,000
years and is warming at an alarming pace, raising the possibility of
viable Arctic shipping routes. The Northern Sea Route, one of three main
passages through Arctic waters, runs along Russia's northern coast from
Murmansk in the west to the Bering Strait in the east. It is usually the
first, and sometimes the only, polar shipping route each summer and the
last to become ice-encumbered each fall. The route makes travel between
Europe and Asia roughly 3,000 miles shorter and 11 days quicker than a
southern transit via the Strait of Malacca and Suez Canal. [[Core
Russian]{.mark} economic and **security
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[and aspects of]{.mark}
**national [identity]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[are at
**stake**]{.mark} in and around the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}.
Economically, [[**one-fifth** of Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} Gross
Domestic Product (**[[GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[and]{.mark} over
[**30 percent** of]{.mark} **government [revenue]{.mark}** [comes from
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to some estimates. Much of
that is from the Yamal Peninsula's oil and natural gas fields. Russia
also has the potential to raise funds from Northern Sea Route user fees
and tolls. In terms of security, the [**Russian [Arctic]{.mark}** [is
home to]{.mark} much of [Russia's]{.mark} strategic **[nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the form of its Northern Fleet
submarines based outside of Murmansk. Were the United States to attack
those submarines, it would most likely route that attack over the North
Pole and across the the route along Russia's border. One way for Russia
to protect their nuclear deterrent, then, is to limit access to and
across the Northern Sea Route. Finally, [the [Arctic **resonates**
with]{.mark} Russians' [conceptions of **self** and]{.mark} with the
**[Putin]{.mark}** regime[**'s** desire to **maintain**]{.mark} great
power **[status]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As detailed below, [these
interests have led Russia to become more assertive in its control of
this route]{.underline}.

NB\]

A recent piece in Foreign Policy advocated that the US should not only
continue its freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea but
enhance them and even declare them non-negotiable. [[Already two
FONOPs]{.underline}]{.mark} have been [undertaken
[under]{.mark}]{.underline} President Joe [[Biden]{.mark}'s
[admin]{.mark}istration]{.underline}. But [[**continuing** them is a
**bad idea.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [US [FONOPs are]{.mark} arguably [a
**violation** of **international law** and a cover for **freedom to
spy**; increase the risk of **confrontation** and **conflict**]{.mark};
are [unwelcome]{.mark} by Southeast Asian states; are
[ineffective]{.mark}; [and]{.mark} are [legally
unnecessary]{.mark}.]{.underline} FONOPs targeting China's claims to
certain features and its territorial sea regime can be [interpreted as a
threat to **use force** against its claimed territorial
integrity]{.underline}. As such they may violate the prohibitions
against the use of force in the UN Charter and the UN Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Moreover, [the US and China have differences of
interpretation regarding relevant clauses of the UNCLOS -- which the US
has not **ratified**]{.underline}. China and many other countries argue
that the Convention is a series of package deals and that non-ratifiers
are not entitled to the "benefits" of the bargains while picking and
choosing which of the provisions -- or their interpretations thereof --
they wish to abide by. They contend that interpretation of key terms in
the Convention relevant to freedom of navigation -- such as "abuse of
rights," "due regard" and "peaceful use/purpose" -- are evolving rapidly
through state practice and that non-ratifiers like the US do not have
the legitimacy to unilaterally interpret them to their advantage.
Indeed, China claims that the United States' FONOPs as well as its
intelligence probes are violating some of these principles. Despite US
denials, its [FONOPs]{.mark} against China [have]{.mark} always had [a
political purpose]{.mark} -- [to **[intimidate]{.underline}**
Beijing]{.mark} in[to changing]{.mark} its [policies]{.mark}. Indeed,
some say the FONOPs are also designed to "reassure America's allies and
partners in the region of America's commitment." The [US narrative
**[justifying]{.underline}** FONOPs is
**[disingenuous]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Washington says they demonstrate
and protect freedom of navigation and challenge claims that violate that
principle. But the [US]{.mark} is disingenuously [conflat]{.mark}ing
[freedom of **[commercial]{.underline}** navigation with]{.mark} freedom
of [**[military vessels]{.underline}** to spy]{.mark} on countries -- in
this case China. [China]{.mark} has [never]{.mark} tried to [interfere
with **[commercial freedom]{.underline}**]{.mark} of navigation, and the
US well knows this. The former US chief of naval operations, Admiral
John Richardson, claimed that US FONOPs "are by design non-provocative,
non-escalatory." That may be the US intent, but Richardson well knows
that [China views the **[FONOPs]{.underline}** as]{.mark} a
**[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** of use [of
**[force]{.underline}**]{.mark} and that they [increase]{.mark} the
possibility of **[[confrontation and conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Because of this risk, they are not welcome by Southeast Asian countries.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein has said, "While
international law guarantees the freedom of navigation, the presence of
warships and vessels in the South China Sea has the potential to
increase tensions that in turn may result in miscalculations which may
affect peace, security and stability in the region." While some may
agree with the US legal [interpretation of freedom of navigation for
warships, they **do not support** their use to **enforce** that
interpretation]{.underline}. Indeed, after the October 2018 Decatur
incident, Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said, "Some of the
incidents are from assertion of principles, but we recognize that the
price of any physical incident is one that is too high and unnecessary
to either assert or prove your position." Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte said that "the threat of confrontation and trouble in the
waterway came from outside the region." Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad argues that "[big **[warships]{.underline}**]{.mark}
\[[in]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea\] may
[**[cause incidents]{.mark}** and that will [lead to
tension]{.mark}]{.underline}." Also, given that the claims of all
littoral ASEAN members except Singapore and Brunei have been targets of
US Navy FONOPs, it is safe to say that they do not approve of this
gunboat diplomacy -- at least against themselves. Moreover, US FONOPs
are ineffective in that they have not changed China's policies or
stopped its actions that the US declares unlawful. They are also
wasteful: They result in "lost time in restoring \[the US\] war fighting
edge." The US Navy could better use these assets "to train up for
high-end conflict." Despite US rhetoric to the contrary, [FONOPs are
**[not necessary]{.underline}** to demonstrate]{.mark} the [US legal
position]{.mark}. Although no country should acquiesce to claims that it
considers illegal, such non-acquiescence can be effectively and
sufficiently demonstrated by verbal and written diplomatic communiqués.
This diplomatic option seems to be sufficient for other nations
including maritime powers whose rights the US claims to be protecting.
Indeed, [[diplomatic protest rather than "gunboat diplomacy"]{.mark} is
more consonant with the UN Charter.]{.underline} It requires that "[all
Members shall settle their international disputes **by peaceful
means**]{.underline} in such a manner that international peace and
security, and justice, are not endangered."

Since the Cold War, [the U.S. has maintained a steady presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}---specifically the [European Arctic, or High
North]{.underline}---primarily through nuclear submarine deployments
while relying on NATO allies in the region for logistical support.
However, [melting ice caps, an increase in commercial maritime activity,

in the region to achieve a deterrence posture against Russia and
safeguard maritime security]{.underline}. [Deterring **Russian
aggression** is important in all European bodies of water]{.underline},

as other parts of the world,]{.underline} including illegal, unreported,

refugees by sea. The Arctic has r[eemerged as a front for NATO in recent
years]{.underline}, as Russia has ignored European policies not to
militarize the region. Since at least 2010, Russia has been reopening
and rearming much of the Arctic infrastructure used at the height of the
Soviet Union. [In 2012, Russia resumed its patrol of the Northern Sea
Route (NSR)]{.underline}, a commercial shipping lane running along
Russia's northern coastline from the Kara Sea to the Bering Strait. In
2014, Russia established a new joint strategic command in Severomorsk to
oversee its Northern Fleet with renewed focus on the Arctic. And in
2019, following the first successful navigation of the NSR without
icebreakers two years prior, Russia implemented mandatory pilotage for
foreign vessels and demonstrated its maritime interdiction capabilities.
Similar to Russia, [NATO needs to improve its **capability** and
**capacity** to operate on the Arctic front.]{.underline} In order to
deter the Russian threat and safeguard maritime security, [sustained
presence in the region is needed]{.underline}. To this end, [NATO should
create a new standing maritime group]{.underline} dedicated to the
Arctic and separate from the maritime groups focused elsewhere. While
likely to be hotly debated, a new standing maritime group should gain
traction among many of the Arctic states, especially Iceland, Norway,
and Denmark, who have long recognized the growing Russian threat in the
region. With sustained presence, so too will come sustained situational
awareness, which is fundamental for conducting successful operations.
Currently, NATO's maritime component commander, HQ Allied Maritime
Command (MARCOM[), maintains operational control of NATO's four standing
maritime groups: two destroyer/frigate groups and two mine
countermeasures groups]{.underline}. These groups are already
overtasked, posturing against a resurgent Russian Navy across the North
Atlantic, Baltic, and Black Seas, and lending support to NATO's maritime
security operation in the Mediterranean, Operation Sea Guardian, as well
as the EU refugee and migrant crisis. Regardless of these ongoing tasks,
these groups are not tailored for Arctic naval operations. For this
reason, a new group needs to be formed. Instead of relying exclusively
on frigates and destroyers from NATO navies to form the new group, NATO
should look to its coast guards as well, recognizing that many of these
forces field ships that are optimized for Arctic operations. The U.S.,
Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Iceland, and Norway all have Arctic
maritime borders, and most have ice-class ships. Denmark has
Thetis-class and Knud Rasmussen-class patrol vessels, the latter of
which double as icebreakers. Norway has the patrol vessel Svalbard,
which also doubles as an icebreaker and recently completed the first
Norwegian voyage to the North Pole. Three new patrol vessels will soon
join her. Iceland, too, can lend support with their aging but capable
Ægir-class or newer Thor-class patrol vessels. Thor is not capable of
icebreaking, but it can still operate in the Arctic.

Recently, some of the \"talking heads\" on the news have been worrying
about [[the demise of US global hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are
told that the \"American empire\" is in decline and our influence and
status around the world are falling. [We are [told]{.mark} that [this
bodes poorly]{.mark} for both the people of the United States and the
rest of the world. That is [not how I see it]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
I tend to agree that the United States is losing its hegemony, I believe
[that [all of us]{.mark} (in the USA and elsewhere) [will **be better
off** if]{.mark} the United States is no longer the \"leader\" of the
world.]{.underline}

Our decline has been going on since the time of Richard Nixon, through
Carter, the Bushes, Clinton, Obama, and has accelerated under Trump. The
President\'s favoritism for the white and the rich, his erratic
destruction of the administrative and diplomatic state, his complete
inability to address COVID-19, his rejection of reason, science and
expertise, his cultural ignorance, his meanness and cruelty, his selfish
disregard for others (nations and peoples) all have underscored and
advanced our national decline.

We have been taught to think that our country\'s position in the world
stems in part from our status as the world\'s one true democracy, but it
is now very clear that is not the case. Especially since Citizens
United, political power in this country has prioritized wealth and those
who have it. The United States is now a county \"of the rich, by the
rich, and for the rich.\" We have tax laws that favor capital over
income; we have civil and criminal justice systems that protect property
more than people; our public institutions routinely criminalize
immigrants, the poor, and people of color.

If the [[new]{.mark} global \"[role models]{.mark}\" are places like
Denmark, Norway, or Costa Rica, surely the world [would]{.mark} [be
headed towards **fewer threats**]{.mark} to peace, less military
spending, [fewer attacks]{.mark} on local democracies, [more]{.mark}
concern for [human rights]{.mark}, less environmental destruction, [more
environmental protection]{.mark}, and [more
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our national elections are not decided
by the popular vote, but instead by an archaic process based an
unrepresentative group called the \"electoral college.\" Our laws and
policies reflect the interest of the wealthy as communicated to wealthy
legislators by the lobbyists of big business. We have voting laws that
make it a burden to vote for many. As a result[, too often public policy
does not reflect the opinions or interests of the majority.]{.underline}
If it did, we would be like other developed countries and adopt national
health care, paid parental leave, stronger controls on guns and weapons,
free higher education, reproductive rights, and a higher minimum wage.
If we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that there are many more
democratic nations in the world today. [Their [influence]{.mark}
inevitably [rises]{.mark} as [ours falls]{.mark} and [this is a **good
thing** for everyone]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Much of the U. S. hegemony has stemmed from the fact that the United
States is surely the most heavily armed and most militarily active
country in the world. The national myth is that we use military force
reluctantly and only when it is necessary to insure human rights, peace,
and security. [But let\'s look at the record: Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Cuba, Grenada, Dominican Republic, Chile, Central America,
Libya, Congo, Iran, Iraq, Panama, Afghanistan. Are any of these places
were made better as a consequences of our covert and overt
actions?]{.underline} We spend more on weapons of war than any other
country in the world. Researchers at Brown University have found that
since the horror of 9/11, the so-called \"war on terrorism\" has killed
800,000, displaced 37,000,000, and cost taxpayers \$6.4 trillion.

We are told that the United States is the greatest, most productive and
fairest economy in the world. It isn\'t. Over the last several years[,
our share of world production has declined significantly. Increasingly
[our economy is characterized by]{.mark} wide **[inequalities]{.mark}**,
environmental [destruction]{.mark}, and [decreasing life]{.mark} chances
for the many. The earnings ratio between CEOs and their employees has
widened dramatically.]{.underline} Bosses now earn as much as 400 times
the incomes of their employees. Ordinary Americans no longer believe
that future generations will have more comfortable lives than current
ones. People of color in the United States face significant economic
damage just because of their heritage and ethnicity.

President Trump did not create this situation, but he is making it
worse. His administration\'s mishandling of COVID has driven down the
lives of ordinary Americans. Unemployment is up; incomes are down; mass
evictions are looming; GDP has collapsed; and all this is doubly true
for persons of color. The only folks doing well are a few tech bosses
and those who live off the stock market. In addition, [the American
[eco]{.mark}nomy is **[not sustainable]{.mark}** environmentally. Since
we no longer can claim any kind of real commitment to environmental
protection, we can not even pretend to be an international leader in
this area.]{.underline}

[Out tax system is notoriously unfair and confusing]{.underline}. It
favors the wealthy over the middle and working classes; it favors growth
over maintenance and endurance; it favors corporations over families. We
rescue banks from their unwise and sometimes criminal investments while
allowing health care expenses to bankrupt ordinary people, who already
live without paid medical or parental leave, decent vacations, or old
age pensions (all commonplaces in developed and developing nations
around the world). Americans live shorter and less healthy lives than
people do in most developed nations. Our schools are nowhere near the
best in the world, and many schools in poor and working class areas are
so underfunded and under-resourced that they look more like tenements
than campuses. They test and segregate more than they build and educate.
Classes are large, standardized testing proliferates, teachers are
underpaid, armed cops patrol the halls, and facilities are crumbling.

[Simply put, [we have **nothing to teach** the rest of the world]{.mark}
about how to build an economy that serves the people. Many nations
already know how to do it and hopefully, as [we decline]{.mark},
[they]{.mark} will [become]{.mark} ready international [examples of
\"best practices]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

We have long believed we are the proverbial \"city on the hill,\" a
place that is home to a life so rewarding that it is a model for all.
That emperor, too, has no clothes.

[A supposed \"nation of immigrants,\" we do not welcome
newcomers.]{.underline} Instead, we attempt to deter migrants through
practices of harassment, detention, and family separation.

The Coronavirus and the continuing trauma of police brutality have
revealed that our society and its communities are unhealthy[. Too often,
residents have **no trust** in their government and see the police and
other agencies as the agents of an occupying power]{.underline}. And
people around the world recognize that we are a violent nation. Gun
violence rages and mass shootings in schools, churches, nightclubs, and
movie theaters have become distressingly common. Deadly police
repression and practices of mass incarceration impact our communities,
particularly neighborhoods of color. [Guns and violence even
characterize our entertainment media, which we export around the
globe.]{.underline} \"Hollywood\" gets rich by displaying false and
elaborately decorated images of fear, violence and anger. What does such
an unreflectively violent place have to teach the rest of the world?

The cultural spread of a violent breed of radical individualism and the
acceptance of deep inequalities are destroying the foundations of our
society. \"Looking out for number one\" cannot form the basis of a
livable, functioning community[. Norms of reciprocity and equity suffer
when people must struggle against each other to fulfill even the most
basic needs such as food, clothing, housing and medical care. While many
countries define the collective provision of basic needs as the
necessary social infrastructure of a good society, we worry about
something called the \"nanny state.\" The few such programs we do have
are inefficient and inadequate by design, rife with unnecessary
administrative costs, bureaucratic means testing, and minimal
resources.]{.underline} In many, if not most, developed nations ordinary
people earn better wages, have better schools, live healthier lives, and
are more secure and comfortable in communities where they feel
respected, valued, and cared for.

So, [it is very likely that [the declining global hegemony of]{.mark}
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will be **an opportunity** to build
**better lives** everywhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the new global
\"role models\" are places like Denmark, Norway, or Costa Rica, [surely
[the world would be headed towards **fewer threats**]{.mark} to peace,
[less military spending]{.mark}, [fewer attacks]{.mark} on local
democracies, more concern for **[human rights]{.mark}**, [less
environmental destruction]{.mark}, more environmental protection, and
**[more democracy]{.mark}**. And, if America uses this opportunity to
change what we spend on and how we care for each other, [life **will be
better**]{.mark} here at home too.]{.underline}

[Structural Realism and Balance of Power]{.underline}

[To begin with, prominent neorealist Kenneth Waltz contends that the end
of the Cold War has changed the structure of international politics from
bipolar to unipolar with the US being the dominant power. According to
Waltz, days of US being unipolar force in world politics is numbered and
slowly the world is moving towards **bipolarity** or multipolarity
because changes in the structure of international system brings about
changes in state behavior. It does not matter how much self-restraint
and self-control a preponderant power is in its conduct of international
relations; states are always wary and fear the dominant power and thus
he maintains that balancing is universal. \[1\]]{.underline}

[In order to explain why, he has resorted to the Balance of Power
(theory). In most basic sense, international politics is a state of
anarchy where there is no central government and states rely on
themselves to protect their autonomy and perpetuate their survival.
Balance of Power contends that states involve in a balancing act to
check the powers of preponderant force so that no any single state has
enough power to become a global hegemon. \[2\]]{.underline}

[With the relative decline of US, China and America can enter into
bipolar relationship much like the US and the USSR during the Cold War.
Since Waltz himself posits bipolarity as the most stable of
international configurations, it can be argued that act of balancing
between the US and China brings the international distribution of power
into an equilibrium and **averts the risk** of war.]{.underline}

[Socialization of Hegemonic Power]{.underline}

[Most scholars posit that hegemons use threats and rewards to get
compliance from secondary states. Contrary to popular wisdom, scholars
Ikenberry and Kupchan have contended that in addition to material power,
hegemons also have the power of socialization to achieve compliance from
secondary states. They call this the socialization process which
involves 'altering of the belief systems' of elites.]{.underline}

[Basically, hegemons project their vision of international order through
normative principles (norms and values) and not by material incentives;
elites in secondary states internalize them, and devise policies that
are compatible to the hegemon's ideal of the international order. The
authors contend that the world order thus created can sustain even when
hegemon undergoes a decline because the world order created is
relatively inexpensive to maintain in the sense that altering of states
preferences are by virtue of ideals rather than use of coercion. Thus,
by virtue of socialization of hegemonic power, relative changes in
hegemon's distribution of material power (military and economy) does
**not put strain** on the international system.]{.underline}

[So, on viewing the world from the lens of socialization, it can be
argued that the expansion of US normative principles on liberal economic
norm to its former allies and enemies aftermath the second world war
that led to the formation of the current liberal economic world order
provides an explanation as to why in spite of US' relative decline there
is **continuity** for America's liberal economic order. \[3\] The rising
challenger China can be considered to have been socialized -- it has
accepted US led international norms, and participates in various
International Organizations. Thus, it makes less sense for China to wage
war against the hegemon whose ideals it has internalized.]{.underline}

### Heg Good\-\--Catchall\-\--2AC 

#### U.S Heg is best for the current state of the world. A world without a hegemonic power is a world full of anarchy and violence.

"Hegemon" is a loaded word, even if the Greek root simply means leader.
In world politics the term refers to a superpower that dominates the
international system as a whole, for good or ill. In our lifetime, the
United States has been such a hegemon, and controversially so. Now,
though, [America's relative global clout seems to be slipping as other
powers rise]{.underline}. And that'll have far-reaching consequences for
global politics and matters of war and peace. Get a curated selection of
10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. As it happens, I
recently relocated to what a colleague has aptly called Hegemon HQ ---
that is, Washington, DC. It's the ideal perch to investigate this big
question about American leadership, which I intend to do in several of
my future columns. Is US power actually waning, or does it just seem
that way? Does the US, going into a presidential election next year,
even want to remain hegemon? Or are Americans fed up with defending that
battered regime so awkwardly named the "rules-based international
order"? Not least, should the world root for American decline or
continued US preeminence? That last one depends largely on where in the
world you happen to find yourself. If you're in Beijing, US hegemony
can't end fast enough, because you think China should reclaim its
rightful place as a sort of Middle Kingdom in world affairs. If you're
in Tallinn, Estonia, [you want the US to stay strong]{.underline} [and
engaged, because you realize that an]{.underline} [American presence in
Europe is probably]{.underline} [the only thing standing between you
and]{.underline} [renewed]{.underline} [subjugation by the
Kremlin]{.underline} [at some point.]{.underline} Advertisement But
hegemony goes far beyond who can defend whom against what aggressor.
It's ultimately about who determines and enforces the rules of the
system as such --- governing everything from money flows to trade and
shipping on the high seas. Wonks call these multilateral norms "public
goods" because in theory they benefit all countries, especially the
smaller ones. Starting in the 1970s with the work of Charles
Kindleberger, an American economic historian, a popular theory in
international relations has argued [that]{.underline} [you need a
hegemon to maintain]{.underline} [such rules to have
any]{.underline} [order and stability]{.underline} [at
all.]{.underline} [When you don't,
the]{.underline} [international]{.underline} [system reverts
to]{.underline} [its default state, which
is]{.underline} [anarchy]{.underline} --- since the world, unlike a
nation, can't have a single government with a monopoly on legitimate
violence. By this logic, the world was relatively stable during the Pax
Britannica of the 19th century, when the UK ran monetary institutions
such as the gold standard, kept trade routes open with its navy and so
forth. Obviously, that doesn't mean the era was necessarily pleasant,
even or especially for people whom the British colonized. Just more
orderly than it would have been otherwise. Advertisement That imperfect
order then gave way to chaos after World War I, when Britain was no
longer able and America not yet willing to be hegemon. [After World War
II, though,]{.underline} [the US stepped up and reestablished stability,
at least within the capitalist world.]{.underline} [With
institutions]{.underline} [such as [the International Monetary
Fund]{.mark} and the [World Bank and alliances such as
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, that US-led (and not always pacific) regime
was immodestly labeled the Pax Americana, harking back to the ancient
Pax Romana. Almost as soon as "hegemonic stability theory" became
mainstream, however, other policymakers and scholars, especially here at
Hegemon HQ, became anxious that America's moment as world leader was
already passing. Maybe that was due to "imperial overstretch," or
to [America's shrinking share of the world economy]{.underline}, or
something else. But reports of the hegemon's death have been greatly
exaggerated so often that we should be cautious about writing off the US
too soon. As a narrative about international relations, hegemony also
has competition. Traditional realists looking at the long sweep of
history insist that it usually wasn't one power's leadership but rather
a balance of powers that preserved order. Liberal internationalists
continue to believe that countries can cooperate even in the absence of
a hegemon. And far out in left field, Marxists have their own niche
theory of hegemony. Advertisement My view is that [[hegemony as it's
been exercised by the US since 1945 best explains the]{.mark} relative
[stability of the]{.mark}]{.underline}[ ["free
world]{.underline}]{.mark}[" in that era --- defined as increasing
prosperity and liberty for many, if sadly not all, and the absence, so
far, of another world war.]{.underline} Share this article Share That
said, I'm fully aware of the anger in much of the world, and especially
the Global South, directed at the US. Like Britain in the 19th century,
the US often puts its national interest ahead of the system's, which is
a no-no for hegemons. It's also hypocritical, posing as a global
defender of democracy but sporadically supporting coups by repressive
dictators --- this week happens to be the 50th anniversary of Chile's,
in which the US Central Intelligence Agency had more than a gentle hand.
Sometimes, Washington stands up for other countries' national
sovereignty, as in Ukraine. Other times it rides roughshod over it, as
in Iraq in 2003. As hegemon, America is supposed to act as lender of
last resort to prevent global bank runs; instead, it sometimes exports
financial turmoil to the world, as in 2008. But [ask yourself two
questions. The first is whether the world would be better off
substituting in a different hegemon. Given the prerequisites in
economic, technological,]{.underline} [military]{.underline} [and
nuclear power, that could only be China]{.underline} in the foreseeable
future. I doubt many people beyond its borders would choose the Chinese
Communist Party as ward of the international system and its rules.
Advertisement [The second question is whether the world would really
improve if it had no hegemon at all --- that's the alternative implied
by the catchphrase of multipolarity. If you accept, as I do, that the
international system's default state is anarchy, the answer is
No.]{.underline} And even if you believe in the balance of power as the
secret sauce, keep in mind that in that realist tradition war is a
feature rather than a bug in the system --- it's what recalibrates the
scales every so often. The immediate question for me here at Hegemon HQ
is whether the US even wants to keep its role of hegemon. The answer may
become clear in next year's election. Even if it'll be fought over
America's domestic culture wars, it'll also pit two opposing
international visions against each other. One, embodied by Donald Trump
or a politician of his ilk, is transactional, nationalist and
isolationist. The other, represented by President Joe Biden or a similar
candidate, is internationalist and combines idealism with realism and
engagement. The question of America's global leadership may eventually
be decided in part by resources, by the trajectories of rival powers, by
attitudes toward US power across the world and other factors. But even
before those come into play, Americans themselves will get to vote on
it.

#### The U.S. military [locks in]{.underline} ecological collapse. Degrowth [solves]{.underline}.

**[A scenario where demand for [production and consumption]{.mark} is
[reduc]{.mark}ed in the Global North [would allow Global South]{.mark}
countries [room for]{.mark} their own [dev]{.mark}elopment [without
having to]{.mark} service Northern growth or [follow the ecologically
destructive path]{.mark} set by the United States [and]{.mark}
Europe.]{.underline}** Degrowth seeks to reverse this unequal ecological
exchange where the North and South's resource use converge.15 In such a
scenario, **[Global South countries could [focus on]{.mark} using their
[productive capacity]{.mark} and resources to meet their own
needs.]{.underline}** For instance, according to the research by Jason
Hickel and colleagues, an estimate of roughly **[43 percent of Global
North materials have come from the South.]{.underline}** They state, "in
2015 the **[[North net appropriated from the South]{.mark} 12 billion
tons of embodied raw material equivalents, 822 million hectares of
embodied land, 21 exajoules of embodied energy, and 188 million
person-years of embodied labor, worth \$10.8 trillion in Northern
prices---[enough to end]{.mark} extreme [pov]{.mark}erty [70 times
over.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Over the whole period, drain from the South
totalled \$242 trillion."16 Such an analysis, Hickel and his team claim,
confirms that unequal ecological exchange is a significant driver of
uneven development, inequality, and ecological breakdown. A degrowth
program that is international in scope and decolonial in principle will
lessen environmental damage, raise living standards for billions of
people, and provide some level of equality on the world's stage.

It should be noted that **[[degrowth is not a zero-sum game]{.mark}
where those in the Global North would be "worse off" than
before.]{.underline}** In fact, **[[life]{.mark} [would]{.mark} be much
[better for the]{.mark} global [majority]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whether
you live **[[in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** or
Ecuador. While it can't be denied that degrowth would allow us to avert
ecological breakdown, the types of policies and provisioning systems
**[[at the heart of]{.mark} the [degrowth]{.mark} program [would
put]{.mark} a special [emphasis on wellbeing and sust]{.mark}ainability
in all countries.]{.underline}** In a degrowth transition, as opposed to
the "grow or die" ethos of modern economics, all people would have
access to life's necessities: healthcare, education, housing, energy,
internet---what some call a "social guarantee."17 Moreover, **[people
would work less and have more free time to enjoy friends, family, and
nature; people would buy less consumer goods since these items would
have repair mandates; people's health would improve due to less
pollution from fossil fuels and more plant-based diets as well. [There
is a bevy of research demonstrating]{.mark} how we can collectively live
[better lives]{.mark} than we do now [while reducing]{.mark} our use of
[energy and mat]{.mark}erials.]{.underline}**18

Critics of degrowth often ask **["[who would this vision appeal
to?]{.mark}" The answer: the [people]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In my own
research analyzing the world's citizens assemblies, I found that
randomly selected citizens preferred policies that fit within the
degrowth framework: the reduction of energy use, transportation systems
centered around walking, biking, and public transit, and minimizing
flights, to name a few.19 In the case of Spain, their citizens' assembly
advocated for increased understanding of degrowth among the population.
**[Poll after poll shows that [people prioritize]{.mark} the
[environment]{.mark} over]{.underline}** economic
**[growth]{.underline}**.20 **[[Contrary to bad-faith
projections]{.mark} coming from both the right as well as some on the
left]{.underline}**, people are willing to enact much more radical
ecological policies than political ideologues are willing to give them
credit for.

**[Scientific [experts also]{.mark} agree]{.underline}** with the
urgency for degrowth. In a study on support for growth-critical or
growth-supportive statements, researchers found that the majority of
scientific experts support either degrowth or "a-growth" (also called
postgrowth).21 In a survey of experts who work for the German
Environment Agency, these workers were given explicit and implicit
statements about growth where they took a position supporting green
growth, a-growth, or degrowth.22 In both the explicit and implicit
answers, these **[experts were found to be much [more growth critical
than accepting]{.mark} the current [econ]{.mark}omic [dogma of
g]{.mark}reen [g]{.mark}rowth.]{.underline}** In fact nearly half of the
respondents supported degrowth positions when they were implicitly
stated, demonstrating the strong scientific foundation of degrowth
without the political "baggage" of the term that may turn off some
scientists.23 This makes sense since there is no existing evidence for
green growth.24 Degrowth, as it has matured, is no longer becoming an
evidential question, but one of strategy and how to gain political
power.

At the beginning of this piece I mentioned how in a highly
interconnected global system, growth in the North impacts those in the
South. **[While [reducing]{.mark} the [demand for energy]{.mark} and
materials [would]{.mark} likely help [reduce conflict]{.mark} in these
countries, lessen impact on local ecosystems, and allow them to use
their productive capacity to meet their own needs]{.underline}**, it is
possible that without careful attention, degrowth may also exert
unforeseen, negative impacts on the South. Firstly, **[the
[degrowth]{.mark} movement is largely [composed of individuals who
are]{.mark} white, Western, and materially [well-off]{.mark}. This poses
a risk that the policies and proposals on offer from the degrowth
movement may not be inclusive and diverse to include the Global
majority.]{.underline}** Although the degrowth movement has been clear
that its intentions are directed towards the Global North, this lack of
direct contact has resulted in Global South's environmental justice
movements questioning the applicability, framing, and analysis of
degrowth.25 In a series of interviews with environmental justice
organizers in the Global South, Beatriz Rodríguez-Labajos and her team
found that, "For many people in the South -- especially social movements
-- 'degrowth' will not make sense because of their own history and
experiences, having often suffered from situations of poverty and
scarcity of the most basic needs. Some 'growth' to reach more security
in terms of survival is regarded as logical. Therefore, focusing the
struggle on degrowth is not only perceived as 'missing the point', but
is also in some ways a 'luxury' debate." As the labor movement saying
goes, "if you are not at the table, you are on the menu." While degrowth
has comprehensive policy focused on the Global North, the most direct
way to clarify degrowth's intentions is to make a concerted effort to
directly engage with movements in the Global South in bringing the
ingredients and drafting the degrowth menu. We can build off the efforts
already being made, especially with recently increased support among
Global South political and thought leaders.26

Degrowth could remedy the lack of North-South solidarity where the
Northern environmental movement takes direct responsibility for
transforming how the Northern ways of life and production systems rely
on the labor, energy, and materials from the South.

Furthermore, as the degrowth movement has developed, so has its
strategy.27 In its earlier stages, the degrowth movement was largely
focused on the local scale with an emphasis on bottom-up organizing.
Since then, degrowth scholars and activists have recognized the need for
a complementary strategy of both bottom-up organizing and centrally
directed implementation. Like all political projects that rely on
existing institutions, there is an inherent risk that **[[degrowth can
be co-opted]{.mark} or lose its connection with the grassroots. In this
way, the degrowth movement could become too provincial with electing the
right people, playing "pragmatic" politics, and betraying the interests
of the Global majority. [This]{.mark} critique [is]{.mark} [not
exclusive to degrowth; all major political projects]{.mark} require
navigating this difficult political space.]{.underline}**

These criticisms are not to condemn degrowth, but rather, to present
intellectual clarification and greater coordination between the degrowth
movement and its siblings in the South including Buen Vivir, La Via
Campesina, and other post-development and ecosocialist movements. On a
strategic basis, **[degrowth could remedy the lack of North-South
solidarity]{.underline}** where the Northern environmental movement
takes direct responsibility for transforming how the Northern ways of
life and production systems rely on the labor, energy, and materials
from the South (including the waste and ecological consequences),
thereby demonstrating our commitment to a decolonized and
anti-imperialist ethos. The Northern environmental movements have thus
far largely ignored this Global interdependence. Making this point
explicit in our organizations' communications, education, and political
advocacy is a first step. Implementing policies that reduce demand and
ensure global justice can happen on both local and national levels in
which movements target energy efficiency efforts, reduce working weeks,
shift tax burdens from labor to consumption, and first and foremost
target the wealthy through global redistribution of wealth via luxury
taxes and debt relief. Furthermore, Ideas and actions that provide the
Global South with the opportunity to take back its fiscal and productive
sovereignty will also hasten a move towards degrowth.28

In addition, **[[a key industry]{.mark} for degrowth [is the]{.mark} US
[military]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As it stands, **[[the]{.mark} US
[military]{.mark} [is the]{.mark} world's [largest institutional
polluter]{.mark}]{.underline}**, emitting more greenhouse gasses
annually than over 140 other countries, largely due to its massive
transportation system.29 Further, the US military has over 585,000
facilities, at least 750 military bases in 80 countries and owns nearly
27 million acres of land in the US alone, whereby they cut down forests,
pollute landscapes, and threaten biodiversity in the process.30
**[[Given]{.mark} [the]{.mark} US [Military's neocolonial goals]{.mark}
of subjugating the Global South, this is one institution the degrowth
movement should prioritize in its efforts to promote global social
justice and build international solidarity. [The military can]{.mark}
never be "greened"; it can [only be]{.mark} "degrown" or
[abolished]{.mark}.31]{.underline}**

By Carlos Umaña

Climate and nuclear costs

According to a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \[1\],
detailed in the report "From Warheads to Mills" \[2\] in that country
alone, **[the [costs]{.mark} [of damages caused by extreme weather
events]{.mark} were \$400 billion in 2018, and this cost [could]{.mark}
easily [reach \$3 trillion]{.mark} per year by 2050. The [cost of air
pollution]{.mark} from burning fossil fuels [is estimated to be]{.mark}
about \$176 billion per year, or up to [\$5.2 trillion]{.mark}, in
total, [by 2050.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Investment in green technologies is scarce worldwide, especially in the
countries that contaminate the most. However, considering the high
direct and indirect costs of environmental damage, it is clear that
their cost-effectiveness is high. However, political short-termism and
its consequent demagoguery result in the inaction on the part of most
politicians. In fact, many **[political resources and scientific [talent
needed for eco]{.mark}logical [innovation are]{.mark} currently [engaged
in]{.mark} the development of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and other enterprises that, far from solving urgent existential
problems, rather threaten life on the planet.

**[[Nuclear weapons]{.mark}, in particular, [are militarily and
politically obsolete and suicidal.]{.mark} The short-sightedness of this
arms whim is very costly, since [these weapons are]{.mark} extremely
expensive to maintain: current investment in nuclear weapons is [\$126
billion per year and rising.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The risk of nuclear war

**[The [climate crisis increases]{.mark} the [risk of nuclear
war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' Doomsday
Clock, **[a symbolic clock that measures the risk of total catastrophic
destruction by a nuclear war, currently marks 2 minutes to midnight,
[the greatest risk since 1947.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This is mainly
**[[due to]{.underline}]{.mark}** three factors: 1. unstable political
leadership in the nuclear states, 2. increased risk of accidental
nuclear detonation or cyberterrorism due to the vulnerability of the
high and growing reliance on automated systems, and 3. **[[climate
change.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Climate change multiplies the potential for **[[conflict over
resources]{.mark} such as land, drinking water and food reserves, and
[increases]{.mark} the [pressure to migrate. Political collapse]{.mark},
in turn, [leads to extremist leaders gaining]{.mark} control over
[nuclear weapons]{.mark}, which poses a risk in regions where there
already is political tension.]{.underline}**

### Military Degrowth\-\--Warming\-\--2NC 

#### The U.S. military is [biophilic]{.underline} towards [warming]{.underline}, creating an unending [cycle of destruction]{.underline} that causes [extinction]{.underline}.

The aftermath of a storm or other disaster offers an apt context in
which to assess the damage to our world, to consider its broken
relationships, its toxic irrationalities, its predatory impulses, its
false promises, but also its nascent possibilities. These days, there\'s
plenty of aftermath to go around. Out there in the clean-up, Natasha
Iskander and Nichola Lowe have found an encouraging domain of biophilic
possibility: the nonprofit Resilience Force toiling away, quietly
organizing amid the disaster capitalism that profits from misfortune of
many kinds.1 **[Iskander and Lowe\'s grounded yet hopeful essay reminds
us that social and [political pressure can foster institutional change
in ways that affirm]{.mark} how [the environment and the economy]{.mark}
are two sides of the same coin.]{.underline}** It is hard to stress how
important this is in the face of problems so grave and so mighty that
fatalism beckons many instead of the creativity and justice we so
desperately need. Iskander and Lowe draw our attention to the social
contract that underpins systems of labor-and find biophilic potential in
the body of the worker, which is porous to the environment in which she
labors.

I appreciate this example and the linking of labor and the environment,
**[[but]{.mark} ultimately, I think [biophilic potential must be found
before the storm]{.mark} and not only in its aftermath, [because we are
trapped in a]{.mark}n unending [cycle of destruction that must be dug
out at its roots.]{.mark}]{.underline}** To explain what I mean, let me
shift the analytic gaze from Resilience Force to an adjacent presence in
the aftermath: **[[the U.S. military.]{.mark}]{.underline}** How might
we think about an institution that may not be sufficiently moral to be
part of a political moral economy? Can an institution organized around
violence of many kinds become biophilic or
**[[must]{.underline}]{.mark}** it **[[be]{.mark} shrunk,
[dismantled]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rethought, reworked? **[[The U.S.
military is]{.mark} an example of what I call ["self-devouring
growth,"]{.mark} a paradoxical formation that furthers the very problems
it aims to solve.2 Vast [re-sources are invested to ensure]{.mark} our
[security even as military consumption]{.mark} and its attendant waste
[undermine our collective future]{.mark} on a massive
scale.]{.underline}**

**[[The]{.mark} U.S. [D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense is
both the world\'s largest employer and its single largest institutional
consumer of oil.3 This military department [works]{.mark} hand in hand
[with]{.mark} the [F]{.mark}ederal [E]{.mark}mergency
[M]{.mark}anagement [A]{.mark}gency]{.underline}** on many projects,
from search and rescue to debris removal and infrastructure remediation.
They were in New Orleans to remove debris and rebuild the levee system
after Hurricane Katrina. They were in Florida after Hurricane Irma, and
in Houston after Harvey. They cleared debris from the fires in Northern
California in 2017, and National Guard troops were deployed to clear
debris after the deadly tornadoes in Kentucky in 2021**[. [Yet unlike
Resilience Force, the U.S. military helped to foster the deadly
power]{.mark} of such [storms]{.mark} in the first place.]{.underline}**
With a massive carbon footprint, the U.S. military warms our planet
while securing the global flow of petroleum.4 It may clear debris after
a storm, but for nearly a decade in the early 2000s, soldiers deployed
in Iraq and Afghanistan were ordered to throw debris into giant "burn
pits" comprising waste from their bases' daily operations: waste doused
in jet fuel and set alight.5

The U.S. military was on the ground in Puerto Rico after Hurricane
Maria. But the U.S. Navy has long failed to clean the toxic mess they
left behind through decades of bombing the small Puerto Rican island of
Vieques. Our national landscape is littered with several hundred
superfund sites on former military installations totaling many millions
of acres of profound environmental damage.6 Soldiers and military
families, as well as those living in the shadow of weapons facilities
and military installations, face exposure to harmful chemicals including
PFAs (so-called forever chemicals) that have seeped into the
groundwater.7 The military has drenched Vietnam in Agent Orange, covered
Iraq and Syria with depleted uranium weapons, and saturated rural
Colombia in glyphosate, with long-term effects ranging from loss of
biodiversity to human birth defects and cancers to heightened
antimicrobial resistance.8 Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands is now
uninhabitable; Guam is awash in radiation. The planes dropping the
chemicals and the bombs are also spewing carbon.

**[[On the labor front, things are]{.mark} looking equally
[counterproductive]{.mark}. [Soldiers suffer]{.mark} high rates of
[disabling injury and suicide]{.mark}. There is widespread [food
insecurity among]{.mark} military [families]{.mark}, a seemingly
intractable problem of [sexual harassment and assault]{.mark} within the
ranks, as well as a substantial [and]{.mark} seemingly growing problem
of [white nationalism]{.mark}.9 According to an NPR study, nearly one in
five defendants in the January 6, 2021, insurrection were veterans of
the U.S. military.10]{.underline}**

**[[The D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense has [identified
climate change as a problem of]{.mark} national [security]{.mark} and
worked to reduce its consumption of fossil fuels.]{.underline}**11
**[[As a major employer]{.mark} of working poor people, [it
provides]{.mark}]{.underline}** training and educational
**[[opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and offers a potential pathway
to citizenship for the many thousands of noncitizen soldiers. They also
manage pensions and health care through the Department of Veteran
Affairs. **[[But]{.mark} its [efforts to care for]{.mark} its
[workforce]{.mark} [and]{.mark} for the [environment are dwarfed
by]{.mark} the [destruction and death]{.mark} it brings [in the]{.mark}
false [name of]{.mark} something called [security]{.mark}. From the war
on drugs to the war on terror to the dirty wars and the proxy wars, the
growth of the U.S. military helps drive the migration crisis. Biophilia
remains out of reach.]{.underline}**

I think **[Iskander and Lowe are right to point to institutional change
through an interlinking of labor and the environment, locating the
paradox that biophilic potential can be found in the very institutional
processes that exacerbate inequality. But [while I hold out hope
for]{.mark} their [vision of a "pathway for change]{.mark} that runs
through established institutions," I also think [false promises abound
in]{.mark} certain [established institutions]{.mark}, which [leads to
self-devouring growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}**12 If we see the military
deployed to the aftermath, we are missing how they caused the event. We
might think it makes sense that they command nearly half of all
discretionary spending in the federal budget. What if we went about
shrinking the military in a determined way? 13 What if instead of a
national guard, there were a national resilience force? What if this
national resilience force worked through labor justice and biophilic
principles and offered a ladder for those it employed through job
training, educational opportunities, pathways to citizenship, and an
emphasis on green technologies and projects? **[[New institutions cannot
become the site of hope so long as]{.mark} the old institutions, such as
[the military, continue to operate]{.mark} in [their paradoxical
mission]{.mark}]{.underline}**, generating disasters and taking charge
in cleaning them up. **[Our environmental problems are so extreme that
[a new moral political economy will require a fundamental
transformation]{.mark} of the existing order. [Only then can]{.mark} the
biophilic potential of [labor-justice institutions]{.mark} like

### Military Degrowth\-\--2AC

#### **Degrowth reproduces the same problems it seeks to solve if it's done in the SQUO. Now imagine those repercussions when the mechanism of degrowth is full military collapse (This card is especially deadly if they are also reading cap since it's a degrowth deficit and can hurt socialist alts, also explore this author more for a range of deb8 topics, he writes a lot of quality stuff).**

Syracuse University. "Degrowth: An environmental ideology with good
intentions, bad politics." Liberation School. 7/20/2021.
https://www.liberationschool.org/degrowth-a-politics-for-which-class/.

**[The planet is experiencing multiple environmental
crises]{.underline}**: biodiversity loss, deforestation, increased rates
of pandemics, chemical pollution, soil depletion, water contamination
and shortages, runaway non-renewable energy consumption, and climate
change. **["Degrowth"]{.underline}** is an environmental ideology that
**[arose as a political response to these compounding
crises.]{.underline}** Degrowth was originally termed by André Gorz in
1972. Gorz argued that global environmental balance, which is predicated
upon non-growth (or **["degrowth"), is not compatible with the
capitalist system, which requires "accumulation for the sake of
accumulation" \[1\].]{.underline}** Degrowth, according to Gorz, is thus
a challenge to capitalism itself.

Degrowth has become increasingly popular among many environmentalists
and leftists. There are some who even call themselves "degrowth
communists" \[2\]. Thus, **[it's important to have a clear
understanding]{.underline}** of exactly what **[degrowth]{.underline}**
is and whether it **[has the potential to]{.underline}** advance or
**[hold back the class struggle.]{.underline}**

Jason Hickel, a prominent proponent of degrowth, defines it like this:
**["The objective of degrowth is to scale down the material and energy
throughput of the global economy, focusing on high-income nations with
high levels of per-capita consumption"]{.underline}** \[3\]. The
degrowth perspective asks why society is so obsessed with "growth"
(measured by Gross Domestic Product) and seeks to deconstruct the entire
"ideology of growth." The "ideology of growth" is used by the capitalist
class to argue that more and more growth is needed to overcome poverty
and to create jobs. This is bourgeois ideology in the sense that
capitalism relies upon and produces the artificial scarcity to which
we're subjected.

The reality is that, **[in developed capitalist countries like U.S.,
there is an overabundance of material wealth and that scarcity is
socially produced by the capitalist market and private ownership.
Degrowth is correct on the point that if wealth were redistributed then
there would indeed be abundance. However, even though proponents of
degrowth are well intentioned and truly want to solve environmental
crises, the political-economic methods and solutions that degrowth calls
for actually work against creating]{.underline}** the **[critical
mass]{.underline}** necessary to make a socialist revolution here in the
U.S. I address each of these below by showing how 1) degrowth reproduces
Malthusian ideas about so-called "natural limits;" 2) it's anti-modern
and anti-technological orientation lacks a class perspective; and 3)
there are key practical issues with deploying degrowth ideas in the
class struggle itself.

The Connections between Thomas Malthus and Degrowth

Thomas Malthus was an aristocratic political-economist who did much of
his work before the development of industrial-scale agriculture. In his
1798 book, An Essay on the Principles of Population, **[Malthus argued
that in every geographic region there are particular resource limits or
"carrying capacities" \[4\]. Malthus' so-called "law of population" says
that unchecked population growth will outstrip this carrying capacity
that eventually leads to a "natural check" in the form of massive deaths
from starvation and disease to bring the population back under the
carrying capacity. Malthus blamed poor people for "unchecked" population
growth and argued against policies to alleviate people from abject
poverty because it delayed the inevitable: the "natural check" of
overpopulation. Rising wages, Malthus said, led to workers having more
children and thereby creating overpopulation. He blamed workers
themselves for economic crises, with a convenient argument against
rising wages.]{.underline}** Marx rebuffed Malthus' erroneous theories,
clarifying that "every special historic mode of production has its own
special laws of population," and that crises were caused by capital, not
by workers \[5\]. (This is also a point on which he diverged from
Darwin, who adopted Malthus' ideas of population).

Much of **[this same Malthusian discourse continues to exist today as an
explanation for problems such as environmental degradation and
poverty.]{.underline}** However, the development of industrial
agriculture and the production of increasingly higher crop/food yields
proved much of Malthus' theories incorrect.

**[Malthusianism focuses on "overpopulation" as a main cause of
environmental degradation. Degrowth actually reproduces this faulty
notion through the proposition that once resources and wealth are
equally redistributed (which degrowth rightly wants to do), there must
be some "check" on population because, as population grows without any
added economic growth, people will eventually have access to fewer and
fewer resources.]{.underline}** For instance, Giorgos Kallis, another
major proponent of the movement, says that "degrowth envisions radically
reducing the surplus" and advocates so-called "self-limitations" where
there are "collective decisions to refrain from pursuing all that could
be pursued" \[6\]. Rather than the typical Malthusian "natural" external
limits, degrowth goes a step further: it calls for a collective
enforcement of the internalization of Malthusian ideas of limits and
constraints.

The target of degrowth, Kallis declares, is "not just capitalism, but
also productivism" \[7\]. **[Proponents of degrowth argue]{.underline}**
that **[any]{.underline}** type of "economic **[growth is ecologically
unsustainable]{.underline}**---whether it is capitalist growth or
socialist does not make a difference" \[8\]. **[In doing so they
artificially equate the two antagonistic systems]{.underline}** and
abstract away from the qualitative differences between socialist and
capitalist growth. Kallis justifies this claim by arguing that if we did
not change consumption levels in a post-carbon energy regime, then
nothing would really change in terms of environmental destruction
because "the manufacturing of renewable energies requires lots of earth
materials. And the fact that they cost more than fossil fuels might have
something to do with their lower energy returns and higher land
requirements" \[9\]. **[Thus, degrowth does not really have an
ecological theory of capitalism, but an ecological theory of
accumulation. For degrowth, any type of accumulation is bad and requires
increased "material throughput."]{.underline}**

False equivalences between different social systems

**[But do proponents]{.underline}** of degrowth **[know what
accumulation entails?]{.underline}** **[Accumulation simply means
reinvesting the surplus]{.underline}** back into production (either to
expand or repair existing means of production). The **[accumulation of a
surplus is necessary in any society. In his discussions of the
reproduction schemas in the second volume of Capital, for instance, Marx
writes that there has to be some sort of accumulation]{.underline}** in
order to reproduce existing society, to replace and repair fixed capital
like machinery and roads, societal infrastructures, to care for those
who can't work, and so on. There also has to be surpluses for, say,
pandemics and droughts.

The difference is that accumulation under socialism is guided by the
workers themselves who collectively determine what and how much surplus
to produce and how to use it. Under capitalism, accumulation happens for
accumulation's sake, without a plan, and purely in the interests of
private profit. Under socialism, accumulation benefits society as a
whole, including even the ecosystems we inhabit. When workers are in
control of the surplus, will we not develop and grow the productive
forces to make life better and easier for ourselves and more sustainable
for the earth and its inhabitants? Wouldn't we especially grow green
productive forces to build more (and better) schools, public
transportation, etc.? Shouldn't socialists in the U.S. strive to repair
the underdevelopment of imperialism by assisting in the development of
productive forces in the formerly colonized world? While there are
sufficient surpluses of, say, housing in the U.S., there are certainly
not surpluses of housing in the entire world.

Since the rise of neoliberal capitalism, the size of the working-class
stratum composing the "labor aristocracy" has substantially reduced.
Whom exactly are we telling to "self-limit" what we consume and live at
a time when most workers in the U.S. are living paycheck to paycheck,
and accumulating more and more debt? Wages have remained stagnant since
the 1970s while prices have increased over 500 percent. Who exactly is
supposed to limit themselves, and to what? Isn't the problem that the
masses are limited by capitalism?

**[Degrowth is, in essence, a form of ecological austerity for
working-class people \[10\]. Stated simply, by focusing so much on the
consumption habits of workers within capitalism and so little on the
conditions and relations of production, proponents of degrowth end up
reproducing Malthusian ideas of "natural limits."]{.underline}**

\[...\]

Degrowth and building the class struggle

In the U.S., degrowth remains an ideology that is relatively socially
isolated but gaining influence among environmentalists and some on the
left. It's an ideology of guilt rather than revolutionary action. **[The
ideas from degrowth will not appeal to masses of exploited and oppressed
people who actually need more, not less.]{.underline}** Imagine, for
example, canvassing and talking to people in working-class
neighborhoods, trying to get them on board with a degrowth political
platform. **[How do degrowth proponents think workers in oppressed
neighborhoods respond if they were told they needed to consume less to
fight climate change?]{.underline}** Many of us already wait as long as
possible in the winter to turn on our heat! As organizers, we would not
get the time of day, and we wouldn't even believe ourselves. Can you
imagine organizing homeless and unemployed workers around a program of
less consumption? **[Degrowth is an ideology fit for the privileged, and
if they want to consume less, they should.]{.underline}**

**[From the perspective of the practical class struggle, degrowth is
particularly problematic. Degrowth has a rhetorical strategy
problem.]{.underline}** In an unequal country such as the U.S., is the
discourse of less and "self-limitation" realistic and inspiring? Is this
tactic energizing, **[does it speak to the needs of the exploited and
oppressed]{.underline}**, can it mobilize people into action?

Rather than limit everything, **[we actually need to grow certain
sectors such as green infrastructures and technologies.]{.underline}**
Our class doesn't need a political platform that calls on us to give up
the little pleasures we might have--if any at all--for the sake of the
environment. Our class needs a political platform that states clearly
what the real problem is and how we can solve it to make life will
better.

Degrowth takes a non-class approach towards consumption and production.
It is true that some of the more privileged sectors of the working
class, particularly in imperialist countries, consume excessively and
wastefully. **[Degrowth, however, fails to account for the class that
takes wasteful consumption to almost unimaginable levels and the system
that produces these production and consumption patterns. An increasing
portion of the labor of the working class is wasted on supporting the
consumption habits of the numerically small capitalist
class.]{.underline}** No amount of preaching self-limiting morality is
going to convince the capitalist class to consume less, expropriate
less, or oppress less. Once we can get rid of the parasitic
imperialists, then human needs and desires can be met through a planned
economy led by the working class.

#### **Resource wars are inevitable.**

Michael **Claire 15.** Five College Professor of Peace and World
Security Studies and director of the Five College Program in Peace and
World Security Studies. Before assuming his present post, he served as
director of the Program on Militarism and Disarmament at the Institute
for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. "Are resource wars our future?"
Resilience. 11/3/2015.
https://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-11-03/are-resource-wars-our-future/.

To grasp why, consider the latest scientific findings on the likely
impacts of global warming, especially the 2014 report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). When first published,
that report attracted worldwide media coverage for predicting that
unchecked climate change will result in severe droughts, intense storms,
oppressive heat waves, recurring crop failures, and coastal flooding,
all leading to widespread death and deprivation. Recent events,
including a punishing drought in California and crippling heat waves in
Europe and Asia, have focused more attention on just such impacts.
**[The IPCC report]{.underline}**, however, **[suggested that global
warming would have devastating impacts of a social and political nature
as well, including economic decline, state collapse, civil strife, mass
migrations, and sooner or later resource wars.]{.underline}**

These predictions have received far less attention, and yet the
possibility of such a future should be obvious enough since human
institutions, like natural systems, are vulnerable to climate change.
Economies are going to suffer when key commodities --- crops, timber,
fish, livestock --- grow scarcer, are destroyed, or fail. Societies will
begin to buckle under the strain of economic decline and massive refugee
flows. Armed conflict may not be the most immediate consequence of these
developments, the IPCC notes, but combine the effects of climate change
with already existing poverty, hunger, resource scarcity, incompetent
and corrupt governance, and ethnic, religious, or national resentments,
and you're likely to end up with bitter conflicts over access to food,
water, land, and other necessities of life.

The Coming of Climate Civil Wars

Such **[wars would not arise in a vacuum. Already existing stresses and
grievances would be heightened, enflamed undoubtedly by provocative acts
and the exhortations of demagogic leaders.]{.underline}** Think of the
current outbreak of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories,
touched off by clashes over access to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem
(also known as the Noble Sanctuary) and the inflammatory rhetoric of
assorted leaders. **[Combine economic and resource deprivation with such
situations and you have a perfect recipe for war.]{.underline}**

The **[necessities of life are already unevenly distributed across the
planet.]{.underline}** Often the divide between those with access to
adequate supplies of vital resources and those lacking them coincides
with long-term schisms along racial, ethnic, religious, or linguistic
lines. The Israelis and Palestinians, for example, harbor deep-seated
ethnic and religious hostilities but also experience vastly different
possibilities when it comes to access to land and water. **[Add the
stresses of climate change to such situations and you can naturally
expect passions to boil over.]{.underline}**

**[Climate change will degrade or destroy many natural systems, often
already under stress, on which humans rely for their
survival.]{.underline}** Some areas that now support agriculture or
animal husbandry may become uninhabitable or capable only of providing
for greatly diminished populations. Under the pressure of rising
temperatures and increasingly fierce droughts, the southern fringe of
the Sahara desert, for example, is now being transformed from grasslands
capable of sustaining nomadic herders into an empty wasteland, forcing
local nomads off their ancestral lands. Many existing farmlands in
Africa, Asia, and the Middle East will suffer a similar fate. Rivers
that once supplied water year-round will run only sporadically or dry up
altogether, again **[leaving populations with unpalatable
choices.]{.underline}**

**[As the IPCC report points out, enormous pressure will be put upon
often weak state institutions to adjust to climate change and aid those
in desperate need of emergency food, shelter, and other necessities.
"Increased human insecurity," the report says, "may coincide with a
decline in the capacity of states to conduct effective adaptation
efforts, thus creating the circumstances in which there is greater
potential for violent conflict."]{.underline}**

A good example of this peril is provided by the outbreak of civil war in
Syria and the subsequent collapse of that country in a welter of
fighting and a wave of refugees of a sort that hasn't been seen since
World War II. Between 2006 and 2010, Syria experienced a devastating
drought in which climate change is believed to have been a factor,
turning nearly 60% of the country into desert. Crops failed and most of
the country's livestock perished, forcing millions of farmers into
penury. Desperate and unable to live on their land any longer, they
moved into Syria's major cities in search of work, often facing extreme
hardship as well as hostility from well-connected urban elites.

Had Syrian autocrat Bashar al-Assad responded with an emergency program
of jobs and housing for those displaced, perhaps conflict could have
been averted. Instead, he cut food and fuel subsidies, adding to the
misery of the migrants and fanning the flames of revolt. In the view of
several prominent scholars, "the rapidly growing urban peripheries of
Syria, marked by illegal settlements, overcrowding, poor infrastructure,
unemployment, and crime, were neglected by the Assad government and
became the heart of the developing unrest."

A similar picture has unfolded in the Sahel region of Africa, the
southern fringe of the Sahara, where severe drought has combined with
habitat decline and government neglect to provoke armed violence. The
area has faced many such periods in the past, but now, thanks to climate
change, there is less time between the droughts. "Instead of 10 years
apart, they became five years apart, and now only a couple years apart,"
observes Robert Piper, the United Nations regional humanitarian
coordinator for the Sahel. "And that, in turn, is putting enormous
stresses on what is already an incredibly fragile environment and a
highly vulnerable population."

In Mali, one of several nations straddling this region, the nomadic
Tuaregs have been particularly hard hit, as the grasslands they rely on
to feed their cattle are turning into desert. A Berber-speaking Muslim
population, the Tuaregs have long faced hostility from the central
government in Bamako, once controlled by the French and now by black
Africans of Christian or animist faith. With their traditional
livelihoods in peril and little assistance forthcoming from the capital,
the Tuaregs revolted in January 2012, capturing half of Mali before
being driven back into the Sahara by French and other foreign forces
(with U.S. logistical and intelligence support).

Consider the events in Syria and Mali previews of what is likely to come
later in this century on a far larger scale. As climate change
intensifies, bringing not just desertification but rising sea levels in
low-lying coastal areas and increasingly devastating heat waves in
regions that are already hot, ever more parts of the planet will be
rendered less habitable, pushing millions of people into desperate
flight.

While the strongest and wealthiest governments, especially in more
temperate regions, will be better able to cope with these stresses,
**[expect to see the number of failed states grow
dramatically]{.underline}**, leading to violence and open warfare over
what food, arable land, and shelter remains. In other words, imagine
significant parts of the planet in the kind of state that Libya, Syria,
and Yemen are in today. Some people will stay and fight to survive;
others will migrate, almost assuredly encountering a far more violent
version of the hostility we already see toward immigrants and refugees
in the lands they head for. **[The result, inevitably, will be a global
epidemic of resource civil wars and resource violence of every
sort.]{.underline}**

Water Wars

**[Most of these conflicts will be of an internal, civil character: clan
against clan, tribe against tribe, sect against sect. On a
climate-changed planet, however, don't rule out struggles among nations
for diminished vital resources --- especially access to
water.]{.underline}** It's already clear that climate change will reduce
the supply of water in many tropical and subtropical regions,
jeopardizing the continued pursuit of agriculture, the health and
functioning of major cities, and possibly the very sinews of society.

The risk of "water wars" will arise when two or more countries depend on
the same key water source --- the Nile, the Jordan, the Euphrates, the
Indus, the Mekong, or other trans-boundary river systems --- and one or
more of them seek to appropriate a disproportionate share of the
ever-shrinking supply of its water. **[Attempts by countries to build
dams and divert the water flow of such riverine systems have already
provoked skirmishes and threats of war,]{.underline}** as when Turkey
and Syria erected dams on the Euphrates, constraining the downstream
flow.

One system that has attracted particular concern in this regard is the
Brahmaputra River, which originates in China (where it is known as the
Yarlung Tsangpo) and passes through India and Bangladesh before emptying
into the Indian Ocean. China has already erected one dam on the river
and has plans for more, producing considerable unease in India, where
the Brahmaputra's water is vital for agriculture. But what has provoked
the most alarm is a Chinese plan to channel water from that river to
water-scarce areas in the northern part of that country.

The Chinese insist that no such action is imminent, but intensified
warming and increased drought could, in the future, prompt such a move,
jeopardizing India's water supply and possibly provoking a conflict.
"China's construction of dams and the proposed diversion of the
Brahmaputra's waters is not only expected to have repercussions for
water flow, agriculture, ecology, and lives and livelihoods downstream,"
Sudha Ramachandran writes in The Diplomat, "it could also become another
contentious issue undermining Sino-Indian relations."

[Many European shipyards have ceased operations or significantly

[specialized]{.mark}**, [building ice resistant vessels]{.mark},

icebreakers are operated by a state-owned enterprise, compared to the
United States or Canada where the country's navy or coast guard operates
their icebreakers.

In the past, Russian ownership, support of, and business for Finnish
shipyards has raised concerns in US-Finnish relations. However there was
a hard break in relations between Russia and Finland with the invasion
of Ukraine in 2022. [Since then, all ongoing projects with Russian
companies have ceased, the main land border with Russia has been closed

considered a leader in icebreaker production even among its Finnish
peers.

Davie "is a major player in the shipbuilding space, so even if the US

## Nuclear War 

### Nuclear War\-\--No Extinction\-\--1NC 

#### Risk of [extinction]{.underline} from war [now]{.underline} is less than [1%]{.underline}. 

Jeffrey **Ladish 20**. Director of Palisade Research. Nuclear war is
unlikely to cause human extinction. LessWrong. 11/06/2020.
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sT6NxFxso6Z9xjS7o/nuclear-war-is-unlikely-to-cause-human-extinction

A number of people have claimed that a full-scale nuclear war is likely
to cause human extinction. I have investigated this issue in depth and
concluded that even [a full scale [nuclear exchange **is
unlikely**]{.mark} (\<1%) [to cause]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}.
By a full-scale war, I mean a [nuclear exchange between]{.mark} major
world powers, such as the [US,]{.mark} Russia, [and China, using
the]{.mark} **[complete arsenals]{.mark}** of each country]{.underline}.
The total number of warheads today (14,000) is significantly smaller
than during the height of the cold war (70,000). While extinction from
nuclear war is unlikely today, it may become more likely if
significantly more warheads are deployed or if designs of weapons change
significantly. There are three potential mechanisms of human extinction
from nuclear war: 1) Kinetic destruction 2) Radiation 3) Climate
alteration Only 3) is remotely plausible with existing weapons, but
let\'s go through them all. 1) Kinetic destruction [[There]{.mark}
simply [aren\'t enough]{.mark} nuclear [warheads to kill
everyone]{.mark} **directly** with kinetic force, [and there]{.mark}
likely [never will be]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are \~14,000 nuclear
weapons in the world, and let's suppose they have an average yield of
something like 1 megaton. This is a conservative guess, the actual
average is probably closer to 100 kilotons. With a 1 megaton warhead,
you can create a fireball covering 3 km², and a moderate pressure wave
that knocks down most residential houses covering 155 km². The former
kills nearly everyone and the latter kills a decent percentage of people
but not everyone. Let\'s be conservative and assume the pressure wave
kills everyone in its radius. 14,000 \* 155 = 2.17 million km². The New
York Metro area is 8,683 km². So all the nuclear weapons in the world
could destroy about 250 New York Metro areas. This is a lot! But not
near enough, even if someone intentionally tried to hit all the
populations at once. Total land surface of earth is: 510.1 million km².
Urban area, by one estimate, is about 2%, or 10.2 million km.² Since the
total possible area destroyed from nuclear weapons is \~2.17 million km²
is considerably less than a lower bound on the area of human habitation,
10.2 million km[², there should be basically [**no risk** of human
extinction from kinetic destruction]{.mark}. The circle with the white
border indicates the zone of moderate blast damage radius (5 psi): 7.03
km (155 km²) from a 1,000 kiloton warhead, link to nukemap]{.underline}
If you want to check my work there, I was using nuke map. [The even more
obvious reason why kinetic damage wouldn\'t lead to human extinction is
that [nuclear states]{.mark} only [threaten one or several countries at
a time, and never the **population centers** of the entire
world]{.mark}. Even if NATO countries and Russia and China all went to
war at the same time, [Africa, South America, and other neutral regions
would be **spared**]{.mark} any kinetic damage.]{.underline} 2)
Radiation [[Radiation won\'t kill]{.mark} everyone [because there
**aren\'t enough weapon**s, and radiation from them would be
concentrated in some areas]{.mark} [and **wholly absent** from
other]{.mark} areas.]{.underline} Even in the worst affected areas,
[lethal [radiation]{.mark} from fallout [would drop to **survivable**
levels]{.mark} within weeks.]{.underline} Here it\'s worth noting that
there is an inherent tradeoff between length of halflife and energy
released by radionuclides. The shorter the half life the more energy
will be released, and the longer the half life the less energy. The
fallout products from modern nuclear weapons are very lethal, but only
for days to several weeks. From Nuclear War Survival Skills, 1987
edition Let\'s try the same calculation we used with kinetic damage, and
see if an attack aimed at optimizing fallout for killing everyone could
succeed. Using Nukemap again, I\'ll go with the fallout contour for 100
rads per hour. 400 rads is thought too be enough to kill 50% of people,
so 100 rads per hour is likely to kill most all people not in some kind
of shelter. We need to switch to using a groundburst detonation rather
than an airburst detonation, because groundbursts create far more
fallout. A 1mt ground burst would create an area of about 8,000 km² of
\>100 rads per hour. Okay, multiple that by 14,000 warheads, and we get
112 million km². That\'s a lot! It\'s still less than the 510.1 million
km² of earth\'s land mass, but it\'s a lot more than the \~10.2 million
km² of urban space. Presumably this is enough to cover every human
habitation, so in principle, it might be possible to kill everyone with
radiation from existing nuclear weapons. The bright red and slightly
less bright red indicate fallout contour for 1,000 rads and 100 rads per
hour, covering 1,140 km² and 7,080 km² respectively, from a 1,000
kiloton ground burst. Nukemap settings In practice, [[it]{.mark} would
be almost [**impossible** to kill every human]{.mark} via radiation
[with the existing]{.mark} nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}, [even if they were
targeted]{.mark} explicitly [for this purpose]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
first reason is that [[fallout patterns are]{.mark} very
**[uneven]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After a ground burst, fallout is
carried by the wind. Some areas will be hit bad and some areas will be
hardly affected by fallout. Even if most human population centers were
covered, a few areas would almost certainly escape. Two other things
make extinction by radiation unlikely. [[Many countries,]{.mark}
especially in the southern hemisphere, [are **unlikely** to be affected
by fallout]{.mark} much at all]{.underline}. Since most of these
countries are likely to be neutral in a conflict, and not near combatant
countries, they should be relatively safe from fallout. [While fallout
might travel hundreds of kms, [it]{.mark} still [won\'t reach places
separated by greater distances]{.mark}. [Fallout]{.mark} that reaches
the upper atmosphere [will]{.mark} eventually **[fall]{.mark} back
[down,]{.mark}**]{.underline} but usually after the period of lethal
radioactivity. The other mitigating factor is that in typical nuclear
war plans, ground bursts are usually restricted to hardened targets, and
air bursts are favored for population and industry centers. This is
because air bursts maximize the size of the destructive pressure wave.
Air burst detonations result in little lethal fallout reaching the
ground, so populations not downwind of military targets would likely be
safe from the worst of the radiological effects in a war scenario.

## Plastic 

### Plastic\-\--Impact\-\--1NC 

#### Plastic pollution [collapses]{.underline} governance, biodiversity, climate risks, human health, and exacerbate mining\-\--[Extinction]{.underline}.

**IUCN '24** \[International Union for Conservation of Nature; May 2024;
Conservation Science & Policy Organization; IUCN Issue Brief, "Plastic
Pollution," https://iucn.org/km/node/32170\]

[[Due to]{.mark} solar radiation, wind, currents and other [natural
factors, plastic breaks]{.mark} down [into **microplastic**]{.mark}
(smaller than 5 mm) [and **nanoplastic**]{.mark} (smaller than 100 nm)
particles]{.underline}. 'Primary' microplastic particles are also shed
by products such as synthetic textiles and tyres, through abrasion.
Nanoplastics are able to cross cell membrane walls and enter living
organisms.

[Many [nations lack]{.mark} the capacities and [facilities to]{.mark}
properly [manage]{.mark} plastic products and [waste]{.mark}, and the
[burden]{.mark} often [falls on]{.mark} the **[local
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That impact is disproportionately felt by
islands, developing countries, Indigenous peoples, local communities,
women, and children]{.underline}. This problem is deepened by the global
trade of plastic products and waste to locations where infrastructure is
not sufficient for safe and environmentally sound management.

Why is it important?

Impacts on human health

[[Microplastics]{.mark} have been [found in]{.mark} **human
[blood]{.mark}** and placentas [and]{.mark} in **[food and
drinks]{.mark}**, including tap water, beer, and salt]{.underline}.
[Several chemicals used in the production of plastic materials are known
to be carcinogenic and can cause developmental, reproductive,
neurological, and immune disorders]{.underline}.

Impacts on economies

[The [build-up]{.mark} of plastic litter can have a negative
[impact]{.mark} on aspects of a [country's **economy and trade**
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, with income declines in sectors such as
small- and medium-enterprises, the informal sector, tourism, fisheries,
agriculture, and water safety. IUCN's research on these economic impacts
demonstrates examples and possible solutions.

Impacts on species and ecosystems

[[All]{.mark} **land, freshwater, and marine [ecosystems]{.mark}** are
[affected by plastic pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Natural
[ecosystems]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} a broad range of [services]{.mark}
that are not only [fundamental for conservation]{.mark}, but also key
for economies and human well-being]{.underline}. For example, healthy
mangroves provide coastal protection services, whereas wetlands are
important for freshwater provision.

The most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion,
suffocation, and entanglement of species. Wildlife such as birds,
whales, fish, and turtles mistake indigestible plastic waste for food
and die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with it. It also
causes internal and external injuries that reduce the ability to swim
and fly. Domesticated farm animals are also affected by plastic
pollution. Floating plastics transport invasive alien species, one of
the leading causes of biodiversity loss and species extinction.

[Plastic [pollution]{.mark} can also [seep **carcinogenic
chemicals**]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as those contained in certain
plastic products or fireproofing coatings) into the soil. These can run
into groundwater or rivers, affecting exposed people and ecosystems.

Impacts on climate

[**Climate [impacts]{.mark}** [begin with oil and gas
extraction]{.mark}, the [refining]{.mark} of these products [into
plastics]{.mark}, and then plastic pollution itself.
[Incinerated]{.mark} plastic [waste releases g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse
[g]{.mark}ases [and other pollutants]{.mark} into the atmosphere,
[including carbon dioxide, dioxins, and methane]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What can be done?

The removal of legacy plastics and prevention of pollution requires that
fewer plastic products be made, that the circularity of supply and value
chains be increased, and that consumer behaviour be changed. It also
involves public and private investment and the development of
infrastructure along the full lifecycle of plastics, including circular
economy solutions like reuse, refill, etc.

Despite positive efforts from countries to tackle plastic pollution,
such as bans on certain forms of single-use plastics, a global plastics
treaty is essential because plastic pollution is transboundary and a
main driver of biodiversity loss.

To best address the triple planetary crisis and ensure the proper
implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF); the Paris
Agreement; the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); and initiatives
under the broader chemicals, waste, and pollution agenda; a future
plastics treaty needs a common approach and requires collective action
on a global scale.

[[Biodiversity]{.mark} has come to [play]{.mark} a **prominent
[role]{.mark}** [in i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} in **multilateral [environmental]{.mark}**
[agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}. A focus on the connections between
plastic pollution, biodiversity loss, and the degradation of ecosystems
at the global, regional, and national levels is important for effective
action. The protection and restoration of biodiversity, and nature per
se, must be incorporated in the legally binding control measures and
enforcement terms of a future treaty.

## Prolif 

### Prolif Bad\-\--2AC 

#### Prolif bad--increases the risk of a preemptive first strike which miscalculates to nuclear war

**Acton 25** (James M. Acton. Holding a PhD in theoretical physics from
the University of Cambridge and co-director of the Nuclear Policy
program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 06-23-2025.

Such "counterforce" targeting has led to an emerging bipartisan
consensus that the United States' nuclear force is too small. [The
reasoning of those who advocate for more U.S. nuclear weapons is
straightforward: because "our" nuclear weapons target "theirs," the more
"they" have, the more "we" need.]{.underline}\[2\] That logic is likely
to gain traction as China's nuclear buildup continues and even more so
if Russia starts a buildup of its own.

[The belief that the United States faces a deteriorating security
environment]{.underline}, including growing and improving nuclear weapon
capabilities on the part of its adversaries, [is well founded; the
proposed]{.underline} [remedy of acquiring more nuclear weapons is not.
[Deploying more warheads]{.mark}]{.underline} or delivery systems
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[catalyze a **costly and futile**
arms race.]{.mark} Not only would such an arms race **be expensive**,
but [it would]{.mark} also [**exacerbate tensions** with China]{.mark}
[and Russia]{.mark}, thus [**increasing the likelihood** of]{.mark} a
[conflict]{.mark} with either or]{.underline} [both. Moreover, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would]{.mark} start a new arms race at a
**significant disadvantage**: because the U.S. government [need]{.mark}s
[to]{.mark} [modernize]{.mark} its [nuclear forces with an]{.mark}
already [**overstretched** industrial base]{.mark}, it is
[**ill-equipped** to compete]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even more seriously,
[[counterforce targeting exacerbates the risk of
escalation]{.mark}---from a conventional conflict to]{.underline} a
limited nuclear war to [an all-out nuclear war---[by **pressuring** an
adversary to use]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons]{.underline} while
it still could or to take provocative or dangerous steps [to ensure the
**survivability** of its nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

The long-standing U.S. goal of deterring threats to its
allies---extended deterrence---adds additional challenges. Especially
since the reelection of President Donald Trump, U.S. allies have feared
being abandoned by the United States, and some have begun to openly
contemplate acquiring nuclear weapons. [Proliferation, however, even
among U.S. allies, **would be dangerous**. It would **raise the
likelihood** of nuclear war.]{.underline} Moreover, [by exacerbating
tensions between would-be nuclear-armed states and their rivals---which
could ultimately lead rivals to **attack** a proliferator's nuclear
program **[preventively]{.mark}**]{.underline}---it could cause
conventional conflict, too. But if Washington decides to rebuild its
alliances---as it should, and not only to further the objective of
nonproliferation---there is a real risk its approach will focus on
augmenting U.S. nuclear capabilities in a way that risks further
accelerating a new arms race.

#### Arms racing incentivizes escalation to war as its too costly

**Rider 17** (Toby J. Rider. Works in the Department of Political
Science, at Texas Tech University. July 27, 2017. "Arms Races: An
Assessment of Conceptual and Theoretical Challenges." Oxford Research
Encyclopedia of Politics.
https://oxfordre.com/politics/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-528)

War is an inefficient outcome in that fighting the war burns resources
and, thus, shrinks the size of the spoils split by the adversaries.
[Given a choice, states would prefer to divide the larger prewar pool of
resources rather than the smaller post-war pool.]{.underline} Which begs
the question, why are states unable to take advantage of that prewar
bargain that would make them both better off? This is the classic
inefficiency question posed by Fearon (1995). As an answer, Fearon
advances that there are obstacles to prewar bargains states are
sometimes unable to overcome. One of those obstacles, uncertainty, is
borrowed to answer a similar question applied to arms races. Kydd (2000,
p. 229) proposes that because [[rapid increase]{.mark}s [in
military]{.mark} spending [are "inefficient, states have an incentive to
avoid them" but]{.mark} that "[arms races arise when there is
uncertainty.]{.mark}]{.underline}" For Kydd, that [uncertainty is over
the ability of the adversary to compete economically. If the two states
are uncertain about their adversary's ability to carry a large defense
burden needed to sustain an arms competition, an arms race might
commence. And in reducing this uncertainty through the competition, the
states may find that mutually acceptable negotiated settlement needed to
avoid war.]{.underline}

Rider (2009, 2013) builds on the initial insights of Kydd, but in
addition to capabilities emphasizes an additional source of
uncertainty---resolve. Rider (2009) agrees with Kydd that, [given the
costs, states will wish to avoid them if possible]{.underline}. But he
builds on this idea with additional theoretical expectations. First,
[the cost of the arms race will make justifying difficult for all but
the most salient issues over which states disagree.]{.underline} Given
the salience of territorial issues (Vasquez, 1993), Rider (2009)
maintains that these are the issues most likely to produce arms
competitions.

Second, [a rapid increase in military power is not something states can
do on short notice.]{.underline} Indeed, the process of approving budget
or personnel increases, placing and fulfilling orders for armaments, and
realizing the benefits of this increase in power can take years. [This
means that arms races are only useful for certainty types of foreign
policy action, namely, as part of grand strategy]{.underline} (Fearon,
1997, p. 83). This means that [we are most likely to see arms races
during enduring competitions like rivalries rather than short-term
crises.]{.underline} Finally, Rider (2013) advances that [[arms races
are a product]{.mark} not just [of uncertainty over capabilities]{.mark}
but also resolve. Traditionally, arms races are conceived as
competitions over capabilities.]{.underline} But, building on the work
of Slantchev (2005), Rider argues that [states may initiate military-ups
to demonstrate not just capabilities but also that they are willing to
pay high costs]{.underline} (i.e., resolve) [in order to win the
disputed good.]{.underline} Preliminary [[empirical evidence]{.mark} is
[provide]{.mark}d that demonstrates [a correlation]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} the emergence of [arms competitions and **periods of
heightened uncertainty.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This research, with a renewed focus on the causes of arms races, should
be viewed as a starting point rather than an end point. It is promising
but certainly more theoretical and empirical research is needed before
definitive conclusions may be reached. The next, and final, section
discusses the road forward.

The Road Forward

Shifting focus from the consequences to the causes of arms races has
been a fruitful enterprise that should continue. This research has
successfully integrated theories of bargaining failure (Fearon, 1995),
which have revolutionized our understanding of the cause of war, into
understanding why arms races occur. [Arms races, much like war, are a
**product of failure** of states to reach mutually satisfying
resolutions to **status quo disagreements**]{.underline}. Using these
new insights from bargaining theory and war was a natural next
progression, especially given suspected links between arms races and
war. Although war is viewed as a product of bargaining failure, scholars
also recognize [the war fighting process as a continuation of
bargaining]{.underline} (Filson & Werner, 2002) that must overcome the
problems that led to bargaining failure (e.g., war onset) in the first
place (Slantchev, 2003). Advances in applying theories of the causes of
war to understanding war duration, termination, and settlement have
generated great insights (Fearon, 2004; Slantchev, 2004; Werner, 1998).
[Such should be the case with arms races as well.]{.underline}

[If we conceptualize arms races as a product of failed bargaining, and
yet still a continuation of the bargaining process]{.underline}, we
might expect that [the arms race will end when the obstacle to
resolution producing the arms race is finally resolved.]{.underline}
Indeed, Kydd (2000) suggests this explicitly in his model of arms race
onset. He offers that [if arms races are a product of uncertainty over
an adversaries' ability to compete, we might expect arms races to end
when sufficient information is revealed to determine the distribution of
settlement.]{.underline} One implication from Kydd's model is that if
information is revealed through the arms race, it makes fighting a war
unnecessary; thus, arms races might be associated with a lower
probability of escalation. [Such a conclusion is inconsistent with much
of the statistical models]{.underline} (see Gibler et al., 2005; Sample,
2002), which conclude that [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} a modest but
[[robust positive correlation between arms races and
war.]{.underline}]{.mark} But until empirical models explicitly
integrate these theoretical models on the causes of arms races, we
cannot reasonably draw conclusions. Additionally, the idea that
information revelation through the arms race could affect the
competition might also be applied to understand the duration of arms
races and rivalry, how arms races end, and the types of settlements that
emerge.

[It is possible that arms races, although triggered by uncertainty,
affect important factors other than uncertainty that might also
influence decisions for war. Once an arms race commences, states have
multiple options for how to proceed, key among them: continue the arms
race, acquiesce the issue, or launch a war.]{.underline} But how does
the arms race dynamic influence which of these decisions are chosen?
Take, for example, the decision to go to war. Morrow (1989) posited that
[[arms races]{.mark} might [cause war through changes in distribution of
power]{.mark}, which affects states' expectations of winning a disputed
good should war occur.]{.underline} An implication from Kydd's model is
that information revelation from the arms race will make war less
likely. But it is also possible that [[arms buildups]{.mark} could [make
**war more likely**]{.mark} not through fear (Jervis, 1976) or even
failed deterrence but by shifting of preferences. Over time, [**the cost
accumulation** of the arms race]{.mark} could [shift preferences]{.mark}
such [that **launching a war** is preferred]{.mark} to continuing the
race]{.underline} (Slantchev, 2005). War may also come when the defense
burden, the cost of the military buildup relative to the country's total
budget or economy, is unsustainable (Sample, 2002). Without more
explicit theorizing, which integrates theories of bargaining, arms
races, and war, we will continue to struggle with answering these types
of questions.

#### Prolif bad---too many actors increases tensions

**Daalder 25** (Ivo Daalder. 1-8-2025. Former U.S. ambassador to NATO
and CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \"There is no such
thing as good nuclear proliferation.\" POLITICO
[[https://www.politico.eu/article/there-is-no-such-thing-as-good-nuclear-proliferation/]{.underline}](https://www.politico.eu/article/there-is-no-such-thing-as-good-nuclear-proliferation/))

While attending a virtual transatlantic seminar on burden sharing
recently, I heard two Americans arguing that Washington needed to
prioritize military engagement in Asia over continued engagement in
Europe --- a view closely aligned with the incoming administration.

But my ears perked up when one of them said [the U.S. "**would maintain
its extended nuclear deterrent**," even though Europe would need to
defend itself against Russia's military threat.]{.underline} This was
reassuring, for [America's nuclear arsenal has been the cornerstone of
NATO's nuclear security for decades.]{.underline}

However, I have my doubts. NATO's nuclear history consists of one long
effort to reassure nonnuclear European allies that [the U.S. would risk
the destruction of New York or Washington to defend Berlin or Warsaw.
One way it has done so is by deploying nuclear weapons in Europe and
offering some European allies to fly their own aircraft carrying U.S.
nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

The more important reassurance, however, has always involved [the
deployment of U.S. troops on the front line]{.underline}, which
[guarantees America will be involved in any war from the very first
shot. It is those troops that make America's **security commitment**,
including its **nuclear deterrent**, very real --- both for Russia and
for NATO allies.]{.underline}

When I pointed this out, though, the presenter suggested that [European
countries may want to consider getting nuclear deterrents of their own
then.]{.underline} After all, they argued, [Washington had supported
"good proliferation" before --- just look at France and the
U.K.]{.underline} But while this view isn't all that far removed from
what President-elect Donald Trump has been saying, it's also a very
slippery slope.

Indeed, back in 2016, then-candidate Trump argued that Korea and Japan
might want to get nuclear weapons to deal with North Korea's arsenal. He
then offered them little reassurance that the U.S. had their backs. And
later, as president, he was more concerned with getting allies to "pay
up" than defending them in the event of an attack.

Of course, [worries about nuclear proliferation are nothing
new.]{.underline} In 1963, then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy warned of
a "world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have these weapons." But
while Washington did help some allies with their nuclear programs, its
longer-term effort was to stem the desire for acquiring nuclear weapons
through a combination of arms control and alliance building.

Together with the Soviet Union, t[he U.S. negotiated the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which committed nonnuclear
states to remain so, and nuclear states to work toward nuclear
disarmament. Washington also bolstered its nuclear commitments to allies
in Europe and Asia, sharing nuclear information and inviting some allies
to participate in nuclear missions.]{.underline}

[These efforts have been **extraordinarily successful.** Since the NPT
was signed in 1968, only five other countries developed nuclear
weapons]{.underline} --- and one of those, South Africa, dismantled its
small arsenal in the 1990s. Over the past few decades, [arms control
agreements--- as well as stronger alliances --- reduced nuclear
inventories by nearly 90 percent.]{.underline}

But now, this strategy is under severe stress. [New START, the last
remaining U.S.-Russia strategic arms control agreement, **will expire**
in little over a year. Moscow has already made clear it **doesn't seek**
another extension, and Washington is now concerned that Beijing's
rapidly **expanding nuclear arsenal** means future negotiations will
mean trying to pull off a **more complicated** and difficult tripartite
agreement.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [Russia's **military aggression** in Ukraine and its shadow
war against Europe have created the most threatening security
environment the continent has seen in decades, putting alliances under
increasing strain. Plus, China's rapid expansion of its armed forces,
coupled with its growing willingness to use military muscle across its
borders and in the waters]{.underline} of the Pacific, now [challenge
America's longstanding **predominance** in the region.]{.underline}

All this, at a time when the U.S. is sowing doubts about its own global
staying power. Lest we forget, during his first term, Trump's "America
First policy" had a tendency to put allies last --- weakening alliances
long vital to combatting the desire for proliferation.

But it's not just Trump --- America's actions have been running counter
to Washington's nonproliferation interests for longer than that.

[When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, for example, the U.S., Britain and
France did little to counter the effort, even though all three nuclear
powers, along with Russia, had signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. That
agreement was meant to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity and
sovereignty in return for its transfer of the nuclear weapons and
missiles deployed on its territory when still part of the Soviet
Union.]{.underline}

The same can be said of America's more recent actions in Ukraine and the
Middle East too. W[hen Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones
against Israel in April and October last year, a beefed-up U.S. military
in the region was critical to Israel's defense. But when Russia shoots
hundreds of missiles and drones against civilian targets in Ukraine
almost every day of the week, all Washington does is promise more air
defense missiles.]{.underline}

The difference is clear: [As **a nuclear power,** Russia **deters** the
U.S. and its allies from directly defending Ukraine, but as a nonnuclear
power, Iran can do **little to prevent** the U.S. and its allies from
directly defending Israel.]{.underline} No surprise, then, that the
International Atomic Energy Agency recently announced Tehran had
"dramatically" accelerated its uranium enrichment efforts.

In a world less constrained by international norms and rules, and
increasingly governed by sheer power, the strictures that [long
constrained nuclear proliferation are now in danger of loosening --- if
not untangling altogether. And in such a world, even "**good"
proliferation** can soon lead to **very bad results.**]{.underline}

Consequently, and relying on the tenets of realism, [most early arms
race research does not ask why states arm because it is framed as
self-evident. States arm as a response to this **security dilemma**.
Indeed, realism advances arming in the face of perceived threat as the
only logical response.]{.underline} As is a state's decision to
reciprocate rapid arming they see in other states. [The actions of
another state to arm makes you less secure, you cannot guarantee that
they will not use those arms against you,]{.underline} and the
consequences for not doing so in the face of a state with aggressive
intentions is likely destruction. Thus, scholars saw little value in
exploring the "why arm" question. Rather, scholarly emphasis was placed
on evaluating the consequences of arms races.

Instead of focusing on the causes, research assumed an ongoing arms
race, and focused on the outcome---were arms races followed by war or
peace. This was a test of the standard deterrence theory versus spiral
model. [**Deterrence theory**, as used in the arms race literature, is
uncomplicated. [If states want to deter other]{.mark} state[s, they must
meet **aggression with aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Achen &
Snidal, 1989; Snyder & Diesing, 1977). [[A failure to respond]{.mark} to
the actions of others can and [will be perceived as weakness.]{.mark}
When one state, [the initiator state, begins a **rapid military
buildup**,]{.mark} there is a chance they have revisionist or aggressive
intentions. [If the]{.mark} other state, the [defender state, fails
to]{.mark} [reciprocate]{.mark} that buildup, [the initiator]{.mark}
state will [take this as a sign]{.mark} that t[he defender **lacks the
willingness**]{.mark} [or]{.mark} the [capabilities **to resist**
the]{.mark} initiator's [challenge]{.mark}. Consequently, [the initiator
state will be emboldened]{.mark} [to]{.mark} make threats, increase
existing demands, or even [attack]{.mark}. Alternatively, [if the
defender chooses to]{.mark} [reciprocate the military buildup]{.mark} of
the initiator state, the initiator]{.underline} may r[ethink their
revisionist intentions. By reciprocating the arms buildup, [the
defender]{.mark} not only conveys to the initiator willingness or
capabilities to compete, they also [**raise the cost**]{.mark} (by
increasing power and preparedness) [of action]{.mark} for the initiator.
Expectations from deterrence theory are that [arms races]{.mark} should
l[ead to peace by demonstrating resolve, capabilities, and raising the
cost of conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Should
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates ---
and the West --- [worry]{.underline} that [Russian power is on the
rise?]{.underline} You might think so, given the extent to which Russian
interference in this year's elections dominates U.S. news.

But [in fact]{.underline}, **[Russian power is brittle]{.underline}**.
Masked by the country's meddling in Western politics, invasion of
Ukraine and support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad, [Russia is
facing]{.underline} **[profound societal]{.underline}** **[and
economic]{.underline}** **[problems]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
[country's aging population]{.underline} [and economic
weakness]{.underline} [are at odds with its military
spending]{.underline} and global aspirations. In fact, [domestic issues
overlooked by the regime will]{.underline} [soon]{.underline}
**[restrict Putin's ability to adventure abroad]{.underline}** [and
project military force.]{.underline} Put simply, [Russia lacks the
resources to fund its great power pretensions]{.underline}. Consider
these five factors. Let's start by remembering that [the U.S. economy is
ten times the size of Russia's]{.underline}. [Even during the heady days
of high oil prices, Russia was unable to compete]{.underline} with
American economic might. Those days are now long gone. Over the past
decade, hydrocarbon exports accounted for roughly 50 percent of
government revenue. With oil prices hovering above \$100 a barrel for
most of the past five years, Russia experienced an economic boom.
Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, Russia's GDP grew almost ninefold, one
reason for Putin's considerable support. But [the]{.underline} [recent
collapse in global energy prices]{.underline} [hit Russia hard, wiping
out]{.underline} [many of the]{.underline} [economic gains]{.underline}
[of recent years]{.underline} and sending the economy into recession.
Moreover, [the]{.underline} [outlook will not improve any time
soon]{.underline} as Russia's economic growth in 2017 is expected to be
minimal. To prepare for the post-oil era, [the Kremlin created a "rainy
day" reserve fund from surplus oil and gas revenue in the 2000s. With
the drop in oil prices, the government dipped into the fund
repeatedly]{.underline}. Since 2014, Russia's national nest egg has
decreased from \$87 billion to barely \$16.18 billion. The country has
another sovereign wealth fund that contains \$73 billion, but much of
that money has already been allocated. The [economic downturn
has]{.underline} already [had significant consequences]{.underline}. The
World Bank reports that 21.4 million Russians, or [14.6 percent of the
population, now live below the national poverty line]{.underline} and
the number of Russians earning less than \$10 a day has increased 8
percent. In fact, a recent survey found that 41 percent of Russians had
difficulty saving enough to buy food and clothes. The Economic Ministry
predicted that there would be no improvement to average living standards
before 2035. [The]{.underline} [state of Russia's economy]{.underline}
largely **[determines its military spending.]{.underline}** [In 2017
Russia will spend 30 percent of its budget on the military and security
services]{.underline}, with only 2.3 percent going toward health care.
[Because of economic stagnation,]{.underline} [in 2016 Russia's defense
spending]{.underline} **[declined]{.underline}** [for the first time
since the 1990s.]{.underline} [By 2020, Russia is projected to spend
only \$41 billion on the military. That's less than France spends, with
only 46 percent of Russia's population]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[spiraling costs in Syria and Ukraine could]{.underline}
[either]{.underline} [force early Russian withdrawal]{.underline} [or
bankrupt the regime.]{.underline} Indeed, a Russian newspaper recently
revealed that the government spends \$1.8 billion a year just on
military contractors in Syria. Compare that \$41 billion to NATO's
military spending of \$892 billion in 2015. That's a big gap, which
looks set to widen. [Russia]{.underline} [simply]{.underline} [cannot
outspend]{.underline} --- or even match up to --- [a
well-funded]{.underline} [and unified]{.underline}
[Alliance.]{.underline} [Right now,]{.underline} [Putin can be assertive
because the Russian budget prioritizes guns over butter]{.underline}.
Putin's regime has effectively traded economic well-being and social
spending for military might. **[This]{.underline}**
**[bargain]{.underline}** **[cannot hold indefinitely.]{.underline}**
[Consider]{.underline}, for instance, [Russia's]{.underline} **[crisis
in health care]{.underline}**. [Roughly 85,000 rural communities have no
medical infrastructure whatsoever.]{.underline} Russia came last in
Bloomberg's latest health-care efficiency survey, behind 54 other
developed economies. [Yet the government plans to cut health spending by
33 percent next year, bringing spending down to just]{.underline} \$[5.8
billion]{.underline}. The Ministry of Health will receive less than 2
percent of the funding requested for 2017-2025. Salaries for doctors in
the poorest regions can be as low as \$250 a month and will probably
drop further. [All this is made worse by the systemic corruption that
plagues health-care programs]{.underline}. For instance, in 2015, the
Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund simply "lost" more than \$500 million.
Russians are famously stoic, but they are not automata. [Putin's
popularity is founded]{.underline} [not just on media manipulation and
drum-thumping jingoism but]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
[real]{.underline} [economic gains]{.underline}. As Daniel Treisman has
shown, [even in authoritarian states, economic growth is tied to popular
approval.]{.underline} Indeed, [work-related]{.underline} [protests are
already on the rise]{.underline}. And [in a 2017 survey of Russian
citizens, 32 percent of respondents said they might protest if a
demonstration occurred in their home town. That's the highest proportion
since Putin first came to power in 1999.]{.underline} Russia is not a
Stalinist dictatorship but a "managed democracy." [A prolonged economic
downturn will change attitudes]{.underline}. [No matter how powerful or
threatening Russia may seem right now, the current situation can't
last]{.underline}. **[Russian stability]{.underline}** --- and Putin's
regime --- **[rest on shaky foundations and the cracks are beginning to
show]{.underline}**.

Russia's power in the modern world was---and is---built upon its vast
energy and natural resources. As much as 50% of its state budget over
the last dozen years has been oil and gas exports. [With the E.U.
relying on Russian imports for over 40% of its pre-war energy
sources---25% of oil, 48% of pipeline gas, 48% of coal---and the 2021
completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany poised to push these
numbers higher,]{.underline} Putin seemed to have calculated that the
continent was too dependent to risk a proper response to his full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It's now clear he wasn't wrong. .
The other half is that the world has given up on giving up Russian
energy. The embargoes on Russian energy products are not much more than
sanctions theater. [Austria is the most flagrant example, with Russian
gas still accounting for the vast majority of its energy imports. But
even where pipeline gas imports to the E.U. have stopped, the more
expensive Russian LNG was never banned so its purchase has increased by
almost 20%---leaving Russia as the second biggest seller of gas to the
continent, and guaranteeing the Kremlin higher profits. Meanwhile,
so-called "shadow fleet" oil tankers carrying Russian oil have been
pulling directly into European ports for several months, according to
Greenpeace, in violation of Western sanctions. In total, the E.U. has
paid Russia over €196 billion for oil, gas, and coal since February
2022, money that has kept the Kremlin flush---Russia has even managed to
rebuild its military.]{.underline}

#### Russia's lower nuclear threshold makes Nuclear war probability high now.

International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) at Stanford University.
"How credible is Russia's evolving nuclear doctrine" Brookings.
11/14/2024.

Facing the possibility of a broad Ukrainian counteroffensive in
September 2022, Moscow rattled the nuclear saber and then quickly toned
down its nuclear rhetoric. However, as the Russian military failed to
make significant progress in 2023 and NATO members supplied Ukraine with
increasingly sophisticated weapons, [some Russian security experts
suggested that Russia lower its threshold for nuclear use]{.underline}.
Sergey Karaganov proposed limited nuclear strikes against Western Europe
to reestablish the West's fear of Russia's nuclear deterrent. He
downplayed the risk of almost certain nuclear retaliation, and his
proposal was rejected by other Russian security experts as well as
Putin. Nevertheless, the [idea of threatening nuclear use to dissuade
the West from supporting Ukraine apparently took hold within the
Kremlin.]{.underline} The Russian military has given greater visibility
to exercises involving non-strategic (tactical) nuclear arms, most
recently last spring. On September 25, 2024, Putin described further
changes to Russian nuclear doctrine, though they were not as radical as
experts such as Karaganov sought. First, [Moscow would consider
"aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the
participation or support of a nuclear state" as a "joint attack" on
Russia. Second, Russia would consider using nuclear arms on "receipt of
reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack
weapons and their crossing of our state border," to include an attack by
"strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, hypersonic
and other aircraft." Third, Russia would reserve "the right to use
nuclear weapons in the event of aggression against Russia and Belarus as
a member of the \[Russia-Belarus\] Union State," including an attack in
which the adversary "using conventional weapons, creates a critical
threat to our sovereignty]{.underline}." The first point on "joint
attack" aims to [implicate NATO's three nuclear-weapon states in
conventional attacks by Ukraine against Russian territory]{.underline}.
The second point revises the 2020 modification regarding receipt of
information of an attack with ballistic missiles to include attack by
virtually any kind of aircraft, missile, or drone. [It seems credible
that a large-scale attack on Russian nuclear forces using air-delivered
weapons, cruise missiles, and drones could trigger a Russian launch of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Would Moscow resort to nuclear weapons in
response to an attack with short-range ballistic missiles, cruise
missiles, and/or drones focused on units in Russia supporting military
operations in Ukraine? That seems nowhere near as credible. The third
point makes two modifications. First, the 2010 doctrine threatened
nuclear use in the event of a conventional attack putting the existence
of the Russian state at stake. The September 25 language covers Belarus,
much as U.S. doctrine covers U.S. allies. Second, the third point
[changes the criterion for when Russia might use nuclear weapons from a
conventional attack that puts Russia's existence "under threat" to one
that "poses a critical threat" to Russian (or Belarusian)
sovereignty]{.underline}. That formulation is ambiguous and undoubtedly
intended to suggest [a lowering of Russia's nuclear
threshold]{.underline}. But what would constitute a critical threat to
Russian sovereignty?

#### Russia's destabilizing economy creates unpredictable military strategies.

Built on Unsustainable Foundations." Vision of Humanity. 5/30/2025
https://www.visionofhumanity.org/russias-war-economy-growth-built-on-unsustainable-foundations/

#### Official figures show that Russia's GDP grew by 4.1 per cent in 2024, exceeding initial forecasts. Yet this growth was driven almost entirely by wartime spending and state intervention, not by improvements in productivity or structural reforms. The [**underlying fragility of this war economy is increasingly evident in widening budget deficits, soaring inflation, labour shortages and the deterioration of essential public services.**]{.underline} The Russian government injected massive amounts of funding into the economy to support its war effort. Between 2022 and 2024, budgetary and quasi-budgetary injections exceeded 10 per cent of GDP, with over 3 per cent in 2024 alone. These funds propped up both demand and supply: soldiers and their families received cash transfers and pensions were indexed, while military industries benefitted from subsidies, tax breaks and preferential loans. Manufacturing sectors tied to defence experienced double-digit growth, fuelling overall GDP expansion. At the same time, core civilian sectors such as coal and oil declined. **[By the end of 2024, more than 50 per cent of Russian coal companies reported financial losses. Mining and non-military industries have been largely sidelined in favour of supporting the war effort, deepening the distortion within the economic structure.]{.underline}** In 2025, Russia's federal budget allocates 15.5 trillion roubles -- approximately \$160 billion -- to national defence. This figure represents 7.2 per cent of GDP and accounts for 37 per cent of total federal spending. However, actual military expenditure is even higher when including classified items and additional wartime social payments. To accommodate these priorities, the government will be reducing transfers to the Pension and Social Insurance Fund by 1.4 trillion roubles, more than US\$17 billion, in 2025. This trade-off is emblematic of a larger trend: civilian needs are increasingly subordinated to military goals. While the official 2025 budget deficit is forecast at just 0.5 per cent of GDP, early-year figures already show a significant gap: spending in the first two months of the year totalled over 8 trillion roubles, with revenues at just 5.3 trillion, producing a 2.7 trillion rouble shortfall. Oil and gas revenues are also declining, undermined by falling global prices. The average price of Urals oil has already fallen sharply towards \$50 per barrel in 2025, compared to the budgeted assumption of \$69.70. As revenues tighten, the government is increasingly reliant on domestic borrowing. The fiscal stimulus has overheated the economy, contributing to rising prices. By late 2024, inflation reached 9.5 per cent year-on-year, well above the Central Bank's 5.1 per cent target. Food prices in particular surged, straining household budgets. In response, the Central Bank raised its key interest rate to 21 per cent, making borrowing significantly more expensive and dampening investment prospects for the private sector. These monetary tightening measures may curb inflation, but they also stifle economic dynamism in the private sector. Businesses face rising capital costs, while households struggle with declining real incomes. **[The high-interest environment adds further strain to an already imbalanced economy]{.underline}**. **[Russia's war economy is driving short-term growth at the cost of long-term viability. Russia is also experiencing one of its worst labour shortages in recent history.]{.underline}** The unemployment rate fell to 2.3 per cent nationally, and even lower, 1.5 per cent, in key industrial regions. Russia's army is 3 per cent of the country's labour force and has roughly doubled since 2020. Wage growth has outpaced productivity, contributing further to inflation and creating mismatches in labour allocation. The war economy is draining talent and resources from essential public services. Healthcare and education are suffering acute staff shortages, outdated infrastructure and lack of investment. These problems are particularly severe in rural and less developed regions, where services have deteriorated to crisis levels. Russia's war economy is driving short-term growth at the cost of long-term viability. The model depends on ever-increasing state spending, primarily directed at defence, while civilian needs and productive sectors of the economy are neglected. Inflation is high, investment is constrained and essential and productive services such as education, social security and healthcare are eroding. The government's fiscal manoeuvring -- cutting social transfers, drawing from reserves and borrowing domestically -- can delay, but not resolve, these problems. This **[approach may produce the illusion of economic stability]{.underline}**, but it is built on a narrow and brittle foundation. Without a pivot away from militarised spending and towards structural reform, innovation and balanced development, Russia's economic trajectory remains unsustainable.

power conflict, it is understandable that the United States fears the

is worthwhile to consider whether the U.S. investment in hypersonics
needs to be rebalanced more toward developing defensive capabilities. It
is also helpful to consider those fears in historical perspective and in
light of constant shifts in the technological and military balance. The
United States needs offensive and defensive hypersonic capabilities for
deterrence. Yet ironically, China and [[Russia's **acquisition**]{.mark}

[**[Histori]{.mark}**cal perspective helps to [temper]{.mark} the [fear
of]{.mark}]{.underline} destabilizing [[**innovations** in]{.mark} the
**[hypersonic]{.mark}** weapon**[s]{.mark}** space by U.S.
rivals]{.underline}. During the interwar period, airpower advocates from
Giulio Douhet to Billy Mitchell insisted that the bomber could not be
stopped. The devastation that bombers could bring to cities would be so
horrific that war simply could not last more than a few days. Airpower,
they insisted, should be used as part of a "relentless" offensive. The
development of radar before the outbreak of World War II, however,
helped reset the balance between offense and defense. As legendary
airman Claire Chennault insisted even before radar was developed, the
bomber would not be "the first exception to the ancient principle that
for every weapon there is a new and effective counter weapon." [[We can
point to **numerous**]{.mark} other [**examples** of]{.mark} this
[**rebalancing** between]{.mark} new **[offens]{.mark}**ive [and
**defens**]{.mark}ive capabilities]{.underline}, such as between armor
and anti-tank missiles. More recently, anxiety about the destabilizing
effects of drones has receded to some extent with the development of
anti-drone technology. Today, experts worry about airpower's limitations
in light of drastic improvements in defensive capabilities, especially
advanced surface-to-air missiles. Hypersonic weapons, however, offer the
possibility of resetting that balance just as improvements in bombers
did prior to the advent of radar. A recent War on the Rocks article
described how hypersonic missiles, "which travel at speeds greater than
Mach 5, shorten John Boyd's famous observe-orient-decide-act loop,
making it nearly impossible for human minds and teams to even comprehend
the information, let alone defend against a short-range attack." The
article paints a compelling picture of the kind of threat the United
States faces as its peer competitors diligently pursue weapons that pose
a seemingly intractable problem. Hypersonic weapons have many in the
U.S. military on edge. Due to their speed, they significantly reduce
reaction time, have sufficient kinetic power to cause significant
destruction even without a payload, and are difficult to intercept. As a
result, hypersonics can bypass a country's defense systems and strike
areas within that country with little to no resistance. The U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency told Congress in its Worldwide Threat Assessment
that hypersonics will "revolutionize" warfare by enabling targets to be
struck faster, harder, and from farther away. Note, however, that such
characteristics are far more evolutionary in nature than revolutionary.
[It is important to acknowledge the limitations of
[hypersonics]{.mark},]{.underline} [which [do]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
fact, [[permit]{.mark} the development of defensive
**[countermeasures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While hypersonic weapons
travel at an extremely fast rate of approximately 2 miles per second,
the speed of the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile, they still pale in
comparison to the speed of directed energy weapons (which travel at the
speed of light, 186,282 miles per second). Directed energy weapons such
as lasers and high-power microwaves are gaining traction because they
address the threat of hypersonics with an unconventional approach.
Throughout history, militaries have tried to defeat weapons by creating
the next most advanced version of those weapons. If one country created
a missile capable of traveling 10 miles, another country would create a
missile capable of traveling 20. However, with directed energy weapons,
the approach is to defeat the technology that makes these advanced
weapons so threatening. Lasers are capable of destroying targets using a
focused beam of energy, while high-power microwaves are an invisible
wave of electromagnetic energy capable of frying microprocessors.
Hypersonic weapons are fast, but they are not instantaneous. Thus,
[[when used against **moving targets**]{.underline}]{.mark} beyond
certain distances, [the [weapons lose
**effectiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the target's speed increases
and its size decreases. Such limitations require most hypersonic weapons
to have some form of onboard guidance, which in turn necessitates
electronic circuits to do computations and make guidance adjustments.
These circuits are highly susceptible to high-power microwave damage.
Additionally, the beam width of high-power microwaves is significantly
wider than that of a weaponized laser, which requires less time to be
used for targeting. Although lasers are extremely effective, when it
comes to countering hypersonic weapons, [they are [limited by]{.mark}
line of **[sight]{.mark}**, limited [**range**, and **power**]{.mark}
**requirements**]{.underline}. For this reason, when talking about
defending against hypersonic weapons, high-power microwaves are the more
logical choice. Additionally, because [**[hypersonic]{.mark}**
weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} are so fast, they [[struggle with
maneuvers]{.underline}]{.mark} in the final seconds against small
fast-moving targets. This is due to maneuverability limitations at high
speeds. Hypersonic weapons, therefore, are most effective for large and
slow-moving or stationary targets, such as an aircraft carrier. [Areas
outfitted with high-power [**microwaves** could provide **area
denial**]{.mark} capabilities for high-value target areas against
hypersonic weapons]{.underline}. Using the equations provided in a
University of Maryland study of high-power microwave technology, a
source power of 9.5 megawatts could deliver the power density required
to damage a hypersonic weapon at a target 25 miles away. This would be
about 12.5 seconds prior to the missile reaching the transmission site,
assuming the hypersonic weapon is traveling directly toward it. This may
not seem like a long time, but the slightest change in trajectory in
anything traveling at those speeds would result in a drastically
different termination point. For example, an angular change of half a
degree would result in a miss distance of 1,150 feet. Additionally,
depending on the fusing method, [high-power microwaves may also be able
to prevent the weapon from fusing and,]{.underline} ultimately, [deny
detonation.]{.underline}

[[Projections for transit]{.mark} routes are constructed using scenarios
(11) that span the [range from]{.mark} very [**high emissions**
to]{.mark} policies that constrain average warming [below]{.mark} around
[1.5 °C]{.mark}]{.underline}. All realizations demonstrate substantial
interannual variability, and the projected navigable season varies
widely from one model to another: [Some models project **no
navigability** by 2065, while others suggest a **reliable season**
now]{.underline}. The ensemble of realizations indicates that the start
of the shipping season trends earlier at almost 3 d per decade in all of
the emissions scenarios considered here. There is significant extension
in the close of the shipping season of 4 d per decade for the medium-
and high-emissions scenarios.

[Using these data, [we assess]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} a
viable open-water [shipping season that avoids **Russian territorial
waters**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fig. 1). [[These routes]{.mark} require
transits through the Bering Strait but [would not]{.mark} [require
**icebreaker**]{.mark} **transport** [or]{.mark}, indeed, Polar Class
[**ice-strengthened** vessels]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consistent with the
earlier retreat of sea ice from the Russian Arctic, the projections
suggest that the likelihood of viable open-water shipping outside
Russian regulatory reach will increase over time. [[The likelihood of
these routes increases faster]{.mark} in the high-emissions scenarios,
as expected]{.underline}. However, interannual variability, and thus
uncertainty, remains high in all scenarios to midcentury. Further, it is
unlikely that access in the lowest-emissions scenario will be realized
with any reliability by midcentury.

as not 33 to 66%, unlikely 0 to 33%, and very unlikely 0 to 10%.

The [[current trade war between the US and China]{.underline}]{.mark} is
likely to [[weigh heavily on the US economy]{.underline}]{.mark} in
particular[. [Inflation is likely to rise]{.mark}]{.underline} by over 5
percent and exports are likely to slump by almost 17 percent. The
consequences for China itself are also considerable, but much less
severe. Germany and the EU are hardly affected negatively. China\'s
Asian neighbors and products such as Christmas decorations, dried fish,
and electric blankets will face substantial additional competition on
the global market. This is shown by simulations using the KITE model of
the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

The result would be a slump in trade between the US and China of almost
50 percent within a year. In the longer term, [[a decline of more than
70 percent is even conceivable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In the short term within a year the increased trade barriers on inputs
and final products would drive prices in the US up by a significant 5.5
percent. US producers would offer many goods that were originally
intended for export at home, meaning that [[US exports are likely to
fall by almost 17 percent. The trade war would reduce US economic output
by 1.6 percent]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"By increasing trade barriers towards the global market and without
access to low-cost suppliers, [[the US is]{.underline}]{.mark} primarily

[An especially important application area for our approach is Arctic oil
spill risk assessment]{.underline}. [[Structural damages]{.mark} due to
a **besetting event** can further [lead to leaks of]{.mark} bunker or
cargo [oil]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As **[oil spills]{.mark}** can
[have]{.mark} [devastating and long-lasting impacts to]{.mark} the
Arctic [marine and coastal ecosystems]{.mark}, [they are
considered]{.mark} the [most significant]{.mark} **environmental
[threat]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} **Arctic [shipping]{.mark}**
activities]{.underline} (Arctic Council, 2009). A proactive approach for
managing such risks calls for comprehensive oil spill risk assessment,
which should take into account two spatially and temporally varying
components: the probability of accidents and the extent of damages
caused by the spilled oil (e.g. Fr˜ azao Santos, 2013; Helle et al.,
2016; Nevalainen et al., 2017; Nevalainen et al., 2019). Our analysis
affords data for the quantification of the former component and hence,
when combined with the information on the latter, i.e. the socio-
economic and environmental resources at risk (see, e.g., Helle et al.,
2020), support the implementation of oil spill risk assessment in the
Arctic. Further, the results can be used to plan the spatial allocation
of resources and activities related to, for instance, search and rescue
(SAR) and oil spill response operations in the Arctic. Hence, the
analysis provides useful information for marine spatial planning (MSP),
an activity deemed necessary in the Arctic to support the management of
spatially and temporally varying demands on marine areas presented by
different users (Edwards and Evans, 2017). 5. Conclusions [[For
ships]{.mark} operating in ice-infested waters, the risk of becoming
[beset in ice is a **hazard** with]{.mark} potentially [serious]{.mark}
safety, **[environmental]{.mark}** and economic
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, the risk of besetting
must be carefully considered in the planning of any Arctic voyage or
operation. [However, this is challenging as a typical
**[besetting]{.mark} event** is the [result of]{.mark} an interaction
between **[multiple factors]{.mark}**, many of [which are
stochastic]{.mark} by nature]{.underline}. In this study, we have
presented a novel data-based approach to predict the probability of
besetting events. Specifically, we have demonstrated that it is feasible
to obtain new and relevant ice besetting related data by merging data
from four existing databases: Automatic Identification System (AIS)
data, satellite ice data, ship data, and real- life data on ice
besetting events. [Specifically, by merging this data, it becomes
possible to determine, among others, the distance that ships of
different Polar Ship Categories operate in different ice conditions
during a year, as well as the corresponding ice besetting
frequencies]{.underline}. Moreover, by feeding the obtained raw data
into a hierarchical Bayesian model, we found the following: Firstly, the
probability of a besetting event is strongly dependent on a ship's Polar
Ship Category so that it is higher for ships of a lower category. For
instance, over a distance of 3000 NM in 90--100% ice concentration, the
probability of a Category A ship to become beset is 0.04. The
corresponding probabilities for ships of Category B and Category C are
0.3 (7.5 times higher) and 0.9 (22.5 times higher), respectively.
[Secondly, [for **all ships**]{.mark}, the [probability]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} a [besetting]{.mark} event [increases]{.mark} **quickly**
[with]{.mark} higher **[ice concentration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
instance, if the ice concentration increases from 60 to 70% to 90--100%,
the probability of a Category A ship to become beset in ice over a
distance of 3000 NM increases from 0.015 to 0.04 (+167%). The
corresponding figures for ships of Category B and Category C are 0.1 to
0.3 (+200%) and 0.4 to 0.9 (+125%), respectively. [Thirdly,
[within]{.mark} the considered region (i.e. the **[NSR]{.mark}** area),
the [sea area does not]{.mark} appear to **significantly
[affect]{.mark}** the [probability of besetting]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a case study in
which the probability of besetting is [calculated for five different
routes]{.mark} on the **Kara Sea** [and three different
seasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. As per the outcome of the case study, the
probability of a besetting event may vary significantly between
different routes and seasons. [As demonstrated by the case study, the
presented approach may directly support the planning and risk management
of Arctic maritime voyages and operations]{.underline}.

### Trade\-\--War\-\--1NC 

#### But, investing in the [NSR]{.underline} and the [NWP]{.underline} spurs trilateral escalation which could be settled [peacefully]{.underline} otherwise.

https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/geopolitical-implications-arctic-shipping-lanes/\]

[[With]{.mark} the emergence of new possible shipping lanes such as the
[**NSR** and]{.mark} the **[NWP]{.mark}**, [states are changing their
**behavior**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. As the ice diminishes,
these shorter maritime routes, their respective ports and natural
resources are causing a renewal of interest in what was once considered
an impassable region. States have expressed interest in using new
shipping lanes for shorter transit times, strategic resource extraction,
military activity as well as regional shipping, fishing and tourism.2)
However, with its unpredictable seas, severe climate conditions, high
costs, and lack of developed infrastructure in the northern territories
-- the Arctic has many obstacles for socio-economic and maritime
development.3)

[[Despite]{.mark} these [obstacles]{.mark}, this [renewed]{.mark}
**regional [interest]{.mark}** may [lead to increased]{.mark}
geopolitical [tensions]{.mark}. Increasing [traffic brings]{.mark} the
possibility of **unknown [ships]{.mark}** [close to]{.mark} many of
these country's [coasts in a way]{.mark} that [they are not familiar
with]{.mark}]{.underline}. States then must determine how to control
their northern borders in harsh climates and territories that, until
recently, were impassable. [Without some kind of vigilance over their
borders, Arctic [states may]{.mark} also [run]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}
of facilitating or falling victim [to increased]{.mark} **transnational
[crime]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, unknown ships also bring
with them unknown purposes, of which many could be illegal fishing or
even illicit trafficking. [Further, the development of the **NSR** and
**NWP** also presents possible issues]{.underline}. [**Unresolved
[disputes]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the [sovereignty]{.mark} of these new
sea routes may be [problematic when shipping]{.mark} does eventually
[become an option]{.mark}]{.underline}. China and Russia's cooperation
on the development of the NSR also brings with it concerns about Chinese
influence in the Arctic as well as American hand-wringing about a closer
relationship between Russia and China.

The Northern Sea Route

Although the Northern Sea Route (NSR) was first opened by the Soviet
Union in the 1930s, it has not been a reliable transit route for many
decades due to ice coverage.4) However, with the increasing melting of
the polar ice caps, the NSR is looking more and more like a potential
transit route. [However, there are **geopolitical
[implications]{.mark}** [concerning the NSR that raise]{.mark}
interesting [questions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps the most basic
geopolitical consideration is who has power over the NSR.
[[Russia]{.mark} has [claimed]{.mark} that the [NSR]{.mark} lies within
its **territorial waters**, [giving it exclusive rights]{.mark} to
develop the area and to patrol ships]{.underline}.5) [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and other powers have [**disputed** this
claim]{.mark}, which has [led to]{.mark} an interesting [paradox where
neither side recognizes]{.mark} the veracity of [who]{.mark} can
[control this passageway]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Interestingly, [Canada
does **recognize** Russia's claim]{.mark} over the NSR as Russia
recognizes Canada's claim over the NWP]{.underline} (See below).

Another geopolitical concern is the development of the NSR. While the
United States has failed for many years to express interest, not all
states have taken such an approach. [[China]{.mark}, for example, is
[working with Russia to develop]{.mark} the [NSR]{.mark} as China sees
the route as important for its national economic interests]{.underline}.
Although the investment is hugely expensive and time consuming, China
clearly sees the development of the NSR as playing the long game.6)
While the route may not be usable now, in a few decades, that could
easily change. Geopolitically, this has huge implications as it brings
China and Russia closer together as allies and encourages both states to
develop more icebreakers -- a necessary tool to navigate the region.

The Northwest Passage

While much of the headlines tend to highlight the importance of the NSR,
[the Northwest passage (NWP) also raises its own concerns, mirroring
those of Russia]{.underline}. [[Canada claims]{.mark} that the
[NWP]{.mark} is [located in internal]{.mark} **Canadian
[waters]{.mark}** and therefore any ship is subject to Canadian law and
sovereignty]{.underline}.7) [[With]{.mark} the [opening of]{.mark} the
[NWP]{.mark}, **Canadian [analysts]{.mark}** have also [raised concerns
about]{.mark} potential [environment]{.mark}al disasters,
[military]{.mark} security, [and]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of
people]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark}, the [question]{.mark} also
[comes down to sovereignty]{.mark} as with the NSR]{.underline}.8) The
United States and the European Union have quibbled with Canada's claim
of sovereignty, claiming that the NWP is an international strait and
that there is a non suspendable right of transit. [As noted above,
Russia and Canada recognize each other's claim over their respective
Arctic passages]{.underline}.

Geopolitically, the opening of the NWP has similar implications as the
NSR. While there is less development with other nations, international
legal questions still remain unanswered about who has control over the
strait. [[Given]{.mark} the [slow rate of change]{.mark}, [there is
still time to find a compromise]{.mark} to this important geopolitical
question before the route is completely free of ice]{.underline}. The
second geopolitical concern is of potential disasters and military
security in the region. Analysts have pointed to the possibility of
terrorists entering Canada from the lightly populated Arctic region --
making the opening of this route concerning for Canadian national
security. While that seems unlikely due to the high costs of entering
Canada in this way, it presents states with new security problems to
deal with.

New Ports

One of the more interesting developments in the Arctic has been the
development of new ports, both hydrocarbon and military-oriented,
throughout the region. Russia is the main mover behind this trend, with
Russian militarization of the Arctic a growing concern for many
policymakers, particularly in the United States. This buildup can be
explained in a few different ways: defense and survivability of
second-strike assets, protection of Russia's commercial interests, and
addressing economic challenges in its polar region.9) While there may be
different reasons for this buildup, there is no question that it is
happening. In recent years, Russia has reopened more than 50 Soviet
bases in the Arctic, both providing themselves more strategic ports
throughout the region as well as sending a message to other
countries.10) No other state has as solid a presence in the Arctic as
Russia does. Opening these ports, no matter how practical, send the
signal that Russia wants to retain what it sees as a historic domination
of the region.

It is tempting to see these new ports as the first step of a
geopolitical contest between great powers. The construction of these
ports is akin, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to Chinese
actions in the South China Sea, presenting an aggressive pattern of
behaviour.11) Whether or not that is true, Pompeo's speech indicates
that the US perceives it as such and will react as it sees fit. While it
is certainly sending a message, I would argue that it is not done so
with the intent to be purely provocative. With the opening of the NSR
and increasing hydrocarbon extraction and research, Russia needs more
bases to keep track of its growing activity. It is not feasible to
expect economic development without subsequent government support in the
form of bases. However, this narrative of geopolitical competition is
certainly present in both Russia and in Western countries.

Geopolitical Analysis

[The opening of new [shipping lanes]{.mark} and construction of new
ports [do not inherently indicate increased]{.mark} geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. [[However, their
consequences do]{.underline}]{.mark}. Increased activity in the NSR and
NWP comes with a few geopolitical concerns. [As discussed above, the
first is that of sovereignty]{.underline}. There is no clarity in either
of these shipping lanes as to who actually has power over who can pass
and what standards they must adhere to in order to do so. [Without this
information, there will be increased uncertainty and therefore more
possibilities for misunderstandings between states]{.underline}. [The
second concern is the possibility of transnational crime]{.underline}.
With increased traffic in these waterways, Arctic states will have to
find some way of monitoring unknown ships and activity. [If not, [the
Arctic may see]{.mark} an increase in [illegal fishing and
trafficking]{.mark}]{.underline}. This indicates that Arctic states,
particularly Canada and Russia, must determine better ways of
controlling their northern borders. Imposing more border control
measures may imply that there will be increased military and security
presence. While an increased security presence might indicate stability,
generally it may also lead to rising tensions between powers. [A final
geopolitical concern is that of the relationship between Russia and
China]{.underline}. [The development of the NSR has started the
beginning of a potential alliance between Russia and China where China
provides funding and technology for NSR development and Russia provides
both access and future benefits for China who may wish to utilize the
NSR]{.underline}. From an American perspective, a Russia-Chinese
alliance is concerning as it increases the possibility of Chinese
influence in the Arctic as well as brings together two countries who
both have poor relationships with the US. Whether or not American stress
turns out to be warranted, the US will still act according to this fear
and may begin to build up military strength in the Arctic just in case.

[While it may seem as though change is happening very quickly in the
Arctic, there is still time to prepare for geographic changes up
North]{.underline}. States will not have to decide on the fly what new
policies will be without coordinating with other Arctic counterparts.
[In short, [geopolitical tensions may be at risk]{.mark} of rising [but
there is no rush]{.mark} to make decisions without thoroughly
considering all of the ways to avoid geopolitical conflict]{.underline}.

[The [main risk of **miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation** with Russia, however,
[pertains to]{.mark} Moscow's contestable interpretation of the legal
status of the Northern Sea Route (**[NSR]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. For
years, the Kremlin has been projecting the NSR as a body of internal
waters covered by Article 234 of the Law of the Sea (also known as the
'Ice Clause'), therefore offering Russian authorities the possibility to
enforce 'non-discriminatory laws and regulations'20) over ice-covered
areas.

[The issue is twofold. On the one hand, the impact of [climate]{.mark}
change is completely [reshuffling]{.mark} access to the [AZRF]{.mark},
in turn [preventing Russia]{.mark} from invoking the clause to increase
[control]{.mark} over the [NSR]{.mark} because of seasonal **sea-ice
reduction**]{.underline}. On the other hand, Moscow's application of
'non-discriminatory' rules is, in fact, highly discriminatory. [Indeed,
for the past few years, [Russia]{.mark} has been introducing stringent
national regulations [clearly violating **UNCLOS**]{.mark} -- for
instance by strengthening navigation rules and transit rights or
interdicting passage to foreign military assets21) through the
NSR]{.underline}.

[[Moscow seeks to appropriate the NSR as]{.mark} a body of [**internal
waters** regulated by Russia]{.mark}n law, [and no longer linked to
UNCLOS under the principles of freedom of navigation and innocent
passage]{.mark}]{.underline}. This obsession for control responds to the
fear of 'encirclement' in the Arctic and the unwarranted belief that
NATO will soon contest the self-appropriation of the NSR.

[Parts of [the **N**]{.mark}orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**oute
[and **N**]{.mark}orth**[w]{.mark}**est **[P]{.mark}**assage are
becoming [more viable]{.mark} for limited **maritime traffic** during
the warmer months, a trend that will almost certainly
continue]{.underline}. Yet increased traffic brings another concern for
Arctic nations --- knowing which vessels are transiting off their coasts
and for what purpose. As the water routes become increasingly passable,
there is likely to be a corresponding rise in fishing activity (legal
and illegal), recreational traffic, research vessels, and perhaps even
illicit trafficking. [Maritime **domain awareness** is increasingly
important to ensure maritime security in the Arctic, yet this is
hindered by the [lack of resources]{.mark} dedicated to the
region]{.underline}. [Challenges with **[communications]{.mark}** and
even **[satellite]{.mark}** limitations further hamper efforts to
establish **regional awareness**]{.underline}.

[These difficulties, along with the region's unpredictable [weather and
ice]{.mark} conditions, combine with the [demands]{.mark} of the
**global shipping** market to [raise]{.mark} serious [concerns
about]{.mark} long-term [viability]{.mark} of **transit shipping** in
the Arctic]{.underline}.

The maritime industry breaks shipping into two categories. [**Transit
[shipping]{.mark}** routes connect the trading hubs of the
world]{.underline}, [whereas **destination shipping** is the movement of
bulk resources]{.underline} (such as oil, gas, liquefied natural gas, or
minerals) from the point of extraction to markets outside of the Arctic
region.

Destination shipping is increasingly viable as regional resources are
explored and extracted (particularly from the Yamal peninsula), then
moved from the point of extraction to market rather than along the
entire Northern Sea Route. The success of the purpose-built Christophe
de Margerie class of ice-breaking liquefied natural gas carriers
highlights the potential of destination shipping.

[However, transit shipping is far more
[problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **commercial [sector]{.mark}**
has [demonstrated lukewarm interest]{.mark} in the possibility of
transit shipping despite the significantly shorter route]{.underline}.
For container shipping of goods (as opposed to bulk shipping of raw
commodities), [shipping [companies rely on economies of scale and
on-time delivery within]{.mark} a [tight schedule]{.mark}; the
ever-increasing capacities of ships help to lower costs]{.underline}.
[Employing this "**[just in time]{.mark}**" [model]{.mark} --- an
inventory strategy that relies on precise shipping schedules to improve
demand and decrease inventory costs --- [is]{.mark} **virtually
[impossible]{.mark}** [given]{.mark} the **operating
[challenges]{.mark}** of the Arctic]{.underline}.

Variation in the depth of the Arctic Ocean will impact viability of
shipping routes. Credit: 90-North.

[The **water [depths]{.mark}** in many parts of the Arctic [pose another
limit]{.mark}ing factor [to]{.mark} commercial [shipping]{.mark}, as the
**largest and most economical** [vessels simply cannot transit]{.mark}
the region regardless of time or weather factors]{.underline}. While the
(as yet inaccessible) Transpolar Route permits an unlimited draft, the
depths vary tremendously along both the Northern Sea Route and the
Northwest Passage (indeed, of the seven routes of the Northwest Passage,
three are considered generally unsuitable for navigation while the
remainder are considered difficult to navigate due to the pattern of ice
drift).

[[Ships **transiting**]{.mark} the Arctic [must]{.mark} also [travel
with **icebreaker**]{.mark} vessel**[s]{.mark}**, [whose slow]{.mark}
icebreaking [speeds and size limitations]{.mark} put a [further
constraint]{.mark} on trade]{.underline}. [This becomes problematic as
shipping companies have sought to increase cargo ship size in an effort
to improve efficiencies and lower costs]{.underline}. [[Not all]{.mark}
icebreakers [can **accommodate**]{.mark} the [width of]{.mark} the
[modern cargo ships, which form]{.mark} the backbone of [global
trade]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Icebreaker escorts, provided along the Northern Sea Route by Russia's
Rosatomflot fleet of icebreakers, are also costly. [An
**[escort]{.mark}** for a typical cargo ship (120,000 ton Arc4 rated
vessel) through the route [would cost]{.mark} around **half a million**
dollars in the summer-autumn period and [**\$1.4 million** during the
winter-spring]{.mark}]{.underline}; the 18 percent Russian
value-added-tax may also be added. [Compare this with the average [Suez
Canal cost]{.mark}s of **[\$465,000]{.mark} per passage**]{.underline}.
Moreover, ship owners must pay increased insurance costs for northern
transits due to the higher risks --- and reduced emergency response
capabilities --- associated with transiting the region. In general,
operating in the Arctic can be vastly more expensive due to higher
insurance, decreased transit speeds, and the potential for significant
weather delays.

[The lack of [infra]{.mark}structure in the region further
[compounds]{.mark} these [limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Russia
has invested heavily in improving its Arctic infrastructure to
facilitate the extraction and movement of resources to markets, the
region remains underdeveloped. [[Hydrographic surveys, channel markers,
deepwater ports, and]{.mark} emergency [response units are]{.mark}
generally **[lacking]{.mark}** in the region and pose serious challenges
to operations]{.underline}. The region has poor communications and
satellite coverage due to atmospheric phenomena, latitude challenges,
and ionospheric effects. Arctic states are addressing these challenges
and there are plans for infrastructure improvements, but the hostile
environment makes such updates arduous and expensive.

Administration daily logs

[Given the challenging conditions and costs, it's not surprising that
the **N**orthern **S**ea **R**oute experiences **limited vessel**
traffic]{.underline}. [For example, as of Sept. 15, 2017, 106 vessels
were operating in the region]{.underline}. [These vessels were primarily
traveling between ports along the Northern Sea Route, particularly
around the development of LNG projects in Russia]{.underline}. By Nov.
1, that number had dropped to 25 vessels; by Dec. 1, there were just 16
vessels. [During the same period, vessels transiting the [Suez Canal
rose]{.mark} slightly from 6,340 in September to 7,842 in
December]{.underline}.

The Northern Sea Route transit numbers stand in stark contrast to global
shipping numbers. In 2017, the Centre for High North Logistics reported
just 24 vessels and 194,364 tons of cargo transited through the Northern
Sea Route, as compared with 17,600 vessels and 1.04 billion tons of
cargo that transited the Suez Canal that year. [Indeed, [**traffic
diminished** along]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**oute [since]{.mark} the peak in [2013]{.mark} with 71
vessels and 1.36 million tons of cargo (as compared to 16,600 vessels
and 915 million tons of cargo through the Suez Canal in 2013) due to
more challenging ice conditions]{.underline}.

and Politics, "On the Vulnerabilities of the Northern Sea Route's
Maritime Transportation System,"
https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/6409\]

[Another major limitation of the **[NSR]{.mark}** as a transportation
system is the fact that only the western part of the route is currently
**operational year-round**]{.underline}42 (Figure 1). Shipping during
the winter--spring season is only made possible by highly specialised
and powerful Arc7 icebreaking carriers, or with extensive support from
powerful Russian nuclear icebreakers for vessels of intermediate
ice-classes (Arc4-5). Sea ice conditions during winter--spring in the
eastern and the main parts of the NSR, along the Laptev Sea, the East
Siberian Sea, and the Chukchi Sea, are much more challenging. [Though
the NSR could be **navigable** in the winter--spring eastwards to the
Asian Pacific in the near future, from a **financial perspective** this
is likely to be a viable [option only for]{.mark} the transport of
[high-demand and high-value commodities]{.mark}]{.underline} (LNG, gas
condensate, crude oil, and iron ore) [in substantial volumes [due
to]{.mark} the **high [investment]{.mark}** needed to construct high
ice-class vessels43 and the costs of icebreaker assistance]{.underline}.
[**Resource [developers]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} their **shipping
[companies]{.mark}** [are **reluctant** to build]{.mark} such vessels
unless they can be put into regular use on a year-round
basis]{.underline}. For other users with less profitable cargo, the NSR
will continue to be a seasonal route only open during summer--autumn,
and therefore of limited international significance.

[Year-round large-scale container shipping via the NSR between the
European and Asian markets would be a prerequisite for the NSR's
integration into the **global transportation system**]{.underline}.
Although international transit shipping on the NSR (i.e., shipping
between two non-Russian ports via the NSR) began in 2010,44 regular
shipping with containerised goods has not yet materialised in the
summer--autumn.45 [Container [shipping]{.mark} in the winter--spring
would also [require]{.mark} powerful Arc7 [**icebreaking
containerships** and]{.mark} assistance from [nuclear
icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Though a prototype Arc7 container
vessel has been designed,46 its construction and **operational
[costs]{.mark}** [would be much higher than]{.mark} for
[conventional]{.mark} container [vessels]{.mark}47 sailing on southern
shipping routes]{.underline}. Whereas high ice-class vessels are the
only option for transporting commodities out of the remote parts of the
Arctic during the winter--spring, container shipping has
well-established southern routes between Europe and Asia, with several
intermediate ports for cargo loading or unloading along them, keeping
the cargo load factor high (but increasing the ship transit time).
[International container shipping [companies]{.mark} are [**reluctant**
to alter]{.mark} long-established [logistics]{.mark} operations on the
traditional route through the Suez Canal for a seasonal one-stop Arctic
shuttle route]{.underline}. [This is [despite]{.mark} current [**Red Sea
attacks** that]{.mark} have at least temporarily [increased]{.mark}
shipping [costs]{.mark} [on the Suez Route]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What has developed on the NSR instead of container shipping was the
shipment, during the summer--autumn season, of general cargo and project
cargo on general cargo vessels (also referred to as multi-purpose
vessels) between NE Asia (mainly China, but also South Korea and Japan)
and NW Europe (mainly the Nordic countries). Such vessels are suitable
for transporting multiple types of cargo in the same shipment. [The
[number of vessels]{.mark} and cargo volumes on the Asia--Europe route
have [stayed consistently low]{.mark} each year (Figure 3), and
shipments stopped altogether in 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. The shippers have mainly been the Chinese
state-owned COSCO Shipping Specialized Carriers, including several
vessels from German heavy-lift shipping companies, some of which were
registered at the time in the Clarkson World Fleet Registry as being
owned by Chinese companies. COSCO started to experiment with
transporting general cargo via the NSR in 2016, in support of the
Chinese government's White Paper on Arctic Policy, published in January
2018.48 [It is likely that [these efforts were]{.mark}, from the start,
politically motivated and [not based on **financial or
commercial**]{.mark} **reasons**. Several of the largest international
container shipping [companies]{.mark} made a statement in 2018 that they
[did not intend to begin using]{.mark} the [NSR for]{.mark} container
[shipping]{.mark}]{.underline}. This included companies which own
popular consumer brands. [In the [after]{.mark}math of Russia's invasion
of [Ukraine]{.mark}, [COSCO stopped]{.mark} **NSR [transports]{.mark}**
in 2022 and 2023, likely [based on]{.mark} both feared **reputational
[consequences]{.mark}** and the unwillingness of European ports to
receive cargo that had been shipped through Russia's NSR
waters]{.underline}.

[[Even in]{.mark} a **[post-war scenario]{.mark}**, container
[shipping]{.mark} between Europe and Asia via the NSR is likely to
[provide limited]{.mark} financial [benefits for Russia]{.mark}, and
only in the form of some additional icebreaker fees]{.underline}. It is
also very unlikely, for security and military reasons, that the Russian
government will support increased traffic of foreign vessels on the NSR
that are only passing through between ports in Europe and Asia.
[[Russia]{.mark} would also be [responsible for]{.mark} providing
**[emergency services]{.mark}** to an increased fleet of transiting
vessels, incl[uding refuge assistance and support for]{.mark} ships in
[distress, search and rescue]{.mark} operations, [oil spill]{.mark}
response, [and salvage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Problematic for foreign
shipping companies has been the fact that the fees to be paid to the
Russian State in the case of accidental damages and pollution of the
Russian Arctic marine environment by foreign vessels have so far been
based on specific Russian methodologies and assessments that are not
fully accepted by the global shipping community.49

[Third, **[almost all major power transitions appear to be the result of
war, not a cause of it.]{.mark}** This pattern is most evident in
transitions associated with rapidly declining powers.]{.underline} The
Spanish Empire was far and away the strongest power in Europe until it
all but dissolved following a series of wars in the early 1700s.
Likewise, the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire
following the First World War wiped two major powers from the map of
Europe[.]{.underline} These [powerful empires collapsed as a result of
wars waged primarily with states for which there was no possibility of
imminent transition. Rising powers owe much to war, but it is only a
partial explanation for their ascent]{.underline}. The rapid rise in the
power of Germany and Italy in the latter half of the nineteenth century
was primarily a result of wars of unification. The rise of the United
States may again be an exception, although only if one excludes the wars
against Indian tribes and nations.

Implication 5: Rising powers attack dominant powers or vice versa

Power transition theory focuses on war between the two most powerful
states in the international system[. [These wars are inherently risky so
leaders must be highly motivated to start them.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Rising [powers must feel excluded from the system]{.mark} and denied
its rewards and convinced that military challenges are likely met with
success. Dominant [powers must believe that a rising challenger
threatens not only their standing in the system but their security and
material interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Leaders must be confident of
mobilizing domestic support for a war. [[They must exploit existing
rivalries to ensure that they can face the dominant power with the
support]{.mark}, or at least the neutrality, [of major third
parties]{.mark}. [None of these conditions are easy to achiev]{.mark}e,
and collectively require political skill and fortuitous conditions.
[Moreover, these conditions must be met during the window when the
rising power perceives itself]{.mark}, or is perceived by the dominant
power, to be pulling abreast in military capability.]{.underline}
[[Perceptions]{.mark} of the changing balance of power may be a
necessary, but [**far from sufficient condition**, for the kind of wars
predicted by power transition theories.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Transition wars are good \-\-\-- they won't cause extinction but causes economy collapse

University of Colorado, Chris, "The Paradox of Global Development and

Most critics would argue, probably correctly, that [[instead of allowing
underdeveloped countries to withdraw from the global
economy]{.underline}]{.mark} and undermine the economies of the
developed world, [[the United States, Europe, and Japan and others will
fight neocolonial wars to force these countries to remain within this
collapsing global economy. These neocolonial wars will result in]{.mark}
mass death, [suffering]{.mark}, and even regional nuclear
wars]{.underline}. If First World countries choose military
confrontation and political repression to maintain the global economy,
then we may see mass death and genocide on a global scale that will make
the deaths of World War II pale in comparison. [[However, these
neocolonial wars,]{.mark} [fought to maintain the developed nations'
economic and political hegemony, will cause the final collapse of our
global industrial civilization.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[These wars will
so damage the]{.mark} complex [economic and trading networks and
squander material, biological, and energy resources]{.mark} that they
will undermine the global economy and its ability to support the earth's

[The future of humanity and all life on Earth is imperiled by the
interacting cluster of dysfunctional economics, biophysical degradation,
cynical politics, technological manipulation, and social
dysfunction]{.underline}. This combination of crises is comprehensively
referred to as the global polycrisis. [As UN Secretary-General António
Guterres said, "We are in the fight of our lives, and we are
losing".]{.underline}

[After centuries of destructive human activities, the fault lines are
becoming increasingly apparent. We are systematically destroying the
natural world and dismantling the Earth's interrelated ecosystems. This
is abundantly apparent in the rate at which we are transgressing
planetary boundaries. The combination of heat, extreme weather,
biodiversity loss, and species extinctions, underscore the
point.]{.underline} Forests are burning, deserts are expanding and clean
water is becoming increasingly scarce. T[he oceans are being subjected
to the triple threat of acidification, warming, and anoxia. Coral reefs
are dying and fisheries are collapsing. Sea ice is melting, and sea
levels are rising.]{.underline}

[The preoccupation with growth inherent in the economics of neoliberal
globalism is driving environmental destruction and unraveling the social
fabric. Rapid economic and social changes have undermined the collective
sense of meaning, purpose, and identity that once used to unite
societies.]{.underline} This makes people vulnerable to exploitation by
those who seek to exacerbate divisions and fan the flames of conflict.

[Nefarious actors are using technology to advance their agendas and
politicians are exacerbating the problems as part of their cynical
pursuit of pow]{.underline}er. They use AI and digital technology to
promote xenophobia and fuel hatred for a fabricated enemy. The goal is
to control popular narratives and influence electoral outcomes. Their
strategically targeted campaigns of disinformation known as big nudging,
exponentially increase their ability to manipulate public perceptions
and behavior.

[Authoritarian political movements are recycling the age-old strategy of
divide and conquer. As explained by the Power Shift Network, they are
trying to break down the unity between groups struggling for justice to
maintain the status quo]{.underline}.

Complex coalescing crises

"The crises we face are no longer isolated; they are colliding and
compounding, creating a perfect storm of interconnected challenges that
amplify one another in ways we can no longer ignore."

\~ Amitav Ghosh

[Crises interact in many ways and this can have significant downstream
impacts.]{.underline} There are linear relationships such as we see in
climate change-induced extreme weather events that destroy crops and
contribute to both food insecurity and starvation. [Non-linear
interactions involve constellations of entangled factors.]{.underline}

A simplified rendition of a slightly more complex dynamic is apparent in
Russia's war in Ukraine. The war contributed to a spike in energy prices
and inflation which exacerbated inequality and further frayed the social
fabric which in turn fueled illiberal politics. This, in turn, is
contributing to the rise of authoritarianism.

The synergistic interactions between crises can be very complex. [They
co-occur, merge, and amplify one another, often coming together to form
cascading assemblages and feedback loops.]{.underline} A wide range of
biophysical issues interact with multiple social crises in
self-reinforcing often vicious cycles. In the absence of a concerted
effort, societal collapse is an inevitable corollary of these
interacting crises.

Global Unrest

This is the core of the problem. **[In Marx's time]{.underline}**, [if
there was]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[sudden
collapse]{.underline}** of capitalism, [most people in the world would
still have been able to]{.underline} **[feed
themselves]{.underline}** and reproduce. [They were
reasonably]{.underline} **[self-sufficient]{.underline}** in their local
area procuring the kinds of things they needed to live and reproduce.
People could put some sort of breakfast on their table irrespective of
what was going on in the global economy and in global markets. **[Right
now]{.underline}**, [that's]{.underline} **[no longer the
case]{.underline}** in many parts of the world. [Most people in
the]{.underline} [**U**nited]{.underline} [**S**tates]{.underline}, in
much of **[Europe]{.underline}**, **[in Japan]{.underline}**, [and now
increasingly in]{.underline} [China]{.underline}, India, Indonesia, [and
in]{.underline} **[Latin
America]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} [depending]{.underline} [more]{.underline} [and
more]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [the delivery of food through
the]{.underline} **[circulation of capital]{.underline}**. In Marx's
time, perhaps 10 percent of the global population was vulnerable to
disruptions in the circulation of capital, as opposed to many more who
were subject to famines, droughts, epidemics, and other environmental
disruptions. The crisis of European capitalism in 1848 was part a
product of harvest failures and part produced by a speculative crash
focused on railroad finance. Since then, capital operating in the world
market has largely eliminated the prospect of starvation due to
supposedly natural causes. If there is famine the underlying causes (as
opposed to the immediate triggers) can invariably be traced to failures
in the social and political system of capitalist governance and
distribution. Much of the world's population is now dependent upon the
circulation of capital to procure and ensure its food supply, access the
fuels and the energy required to support daily life, and to maintain the
elaborate structures and equipment of communication that facilitate the
coordination of basic production requirements.

**[Capital]{.underline}**, right now, may be [too deeply implicated in

of money capital has to be kept in motion for some considerable time
lest most of us starve. It is in this sense that we might say that
capital appears to be now too big to fail. We may aspire to make our own
history, Marx observed, but this can never be done under conditions of
our own choosing. These conditions dictate a politics that is about
sustaining many existing commodity chains and flows while socializing
and perhaps gradually modifying them to accommodate to human needs. As

Countere. 5/17/2023.

Do you feel like there is no future for humanity? Do you lie awake at
night in a panic over global warming? Have you thought about not having
children because of climate change?

I felt like that. To alleviate my climate anxiety, I went to work at a
solar energy company in the American Midwest, installing through solar
panels the carbon dioxide offset equivalent to planting over a million
trees. But the more I learned about my field, the more I became
convinced that climate change, while real, is one of the biggest psyops
of our time---inducing us to live in a state of fear and existential
dread while neglecting other environmental and spiritual dangers that
threaten humanity.

There is a lot of understandable anxiety surrounding global warming.
When one 2019 survey asked Gen Z and Millennials to name the biggest
problem facing their generation was, "climate change" took the top spot.
It's indisputable that the earth is warming, and that this warming is
significantly influenced by human activity. But how this will affect our
society and planet has only been portrayed one way, as
apocalyptic---until now.

[[In mass media]{.mark}, extremely negative [forecasts of the future are
presented as fact]{.mark}, like [maps showing the world becoming a
desert by 2100]{.mark} except for Canada and Russia. [This is
absurd]{.mark} considering that we can't even predict the weather a week
from now, that [scientists have]{.mark} separately [found that]{.mark}
global warming has explosively greened up to half of the the planet's
vegetated areas, and that many [climate predictions, such as 75% of the
Arctic ice cap disappearing by 2016 or sea levels rising 20 feet by
now,]{.mark} simply [aren't]{.mark} anywhere close to coming
[true]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[A world warmer by a few degrees]{.mark} Celsius, [far from dealing a
death blow]{.mark} to humanity, [presents several opportunities]{.mark}
for the flourishing of life]{.underline}: [[a world-altering trading
passage]{.mark} will finally open, [global food]{.mark} agricultural
[production could rise]{.mark}, [and we will]{.mark} even [see the
return of mega-lakes]{.mark} such as Lake Chad in Africa]{.underline}.
This certainly depends on the degree of warming: for example, a 2.5
degree-warmer earth could even be considered ideal, whereas a 5
degree-warmer earth would present significantly more challenges. Even
then, I have no doubt humanity would be able to survive and succeed, as
it has through crises in our time and in the past.

This is an unpopular opinion. In fact, an AI like ChatGPT literally
can't tell you one positive benefit of marginal global warming, as it
said when I asked: "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide you with reasons why
an increase in temperature by 1 degree Fahrenheit would be beneficial to
biodiversity, nature, or human society. Climate change and global
warming, which are largely driven by human activities, have already
caused significant impacts on the planet..." yadda yadda yadda.

There will be negative effects of global warming. [But [scientists and
"experts" **explicitly ignore any positive effects** of]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}.]{.underline} Dissident climatologists like Dr. Judith
Curry, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at
the Georgia Institute of Technology, have stated this is because entire
academic careers, professional recognition, and media spotlights are
linked to one's degree of alarmism over climate change. (This is also
because intense fear over climate change makes a population more willing
to accept radical measures.)

Well, that's why we have Countere. Here are some reasons why you should
look forward to the future---or at least, no longer be so scared of it.

The Northwest Passage Will Open

[[The first]{.mark} major [benefit]{.mark} of global warming [is that
the]{.mark} legendary [Northwest Passage will]{.mark} finally
[open.]{.mark} [For all of recorded history, the only ocean
route]{.mark} connecting the Pacific to the Atlantic [curled
around]{.mark} the tip of [South America]{.mark}, [making such
journeys]{.mark} either [impossible or extremely long]{.mark}. Although
that changed with the opening of the Panama Canal, [the Northwest
Passage]{.mark}, which weaves through Canada's islands and exits at
either Alaska or Greenland, [promises a]{.mark}n even [more direct
journey.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The historical problem was that the Northwest Passage was impassable due
to ice---but that is all changing. The passage became completely
ice-free for the first time in the summer of 2007. Global warming would
finally wrest this route from its frozen lockbox, going so far as to
halve international shipping times and inject a dose of vitality similar
to the effects of the Panama Canal into the world economy.

Millions of Square Miles Will Become Livable

[[According to the]{.underline}]{.mark} Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change [[(IPCC),]{.mark} global warming would warm winters more
than summers and lead to increase in temperatures at the extremities of
the earth more than at the equator. [Vast tracts of land in Alaska,
Siberia, and Canada will thaw and become]{.mark} truly
[habitable]{.mark} for the first time in human history. The quality of
the soil and water in these places, completely untouched by the Age of
Agriculture, is inconceivable to the modern human]{.underline}. [While
the loss of low-lying islands will undoubtedly be a huge tragedy,
significantly more livable land will open up to both humans and animals
in a warmer world.]{.underline}

[[Even at the worst]{.mark} ends of our [climate
projections]{.mark}---[a planet which is 4 or 5 degrees Celsius
hotter]{.mark}---[large portions of Antarctica will become pleasant and
farmable]{.mark}]{.underline}. This raises all sorts of interesting
questions: whether a "Scramble for Antarctica" will begin among the
world's great powers, if there will be major wars fought in Antarctica,
or if an Antarctican civilization will rise in the far-future.

Worldwide Food Production Will Increase

[Moderate [global warming has positive]{.mark} ramification[s]{.mark}
[for food production]{.mark}. In many regions, [spring will start
earlier and growing seasons will be longer]{.mark}.]{.underline} A
hotter climate would increase evaporation from the oceans and lead to
more rainfall globally. [Also, [studies show that at]{.mark} both
[higher temperatures and carbon dioxide levels,]{.mark} crops and other
[plants grow better]{.mark} and are more drought-tolerant.]{.underline}

[[Economist Bjørn Lomborg has estimated that]{.mark} global warming
would boost cereal production in richer countries by 4-14 percent, while
cutting them in poorer countries by 6-7 percent. The official IPCC
assessment is that ["a few degrees of]{.mark} projected [warming will
lead to]{.mark} general [increases in]{.mark} temperate [crop
yields]{.mark},]{.underline} with some regional variation." A 2007
report by [[the US Department of Agriculture found that]{.mark} global
warming [was]{.mark} likely [to have a]{.mark} small [positive effect
on]{.mark} world [food production, and]{.mark} therefore [agricultural
prices will]{.mark} possibly [decrease.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Earth Will Become Greener

[[Though]{.mark} popular [visions of]{.mark} global [warming see the
earth transforming into a]{.mark}n inhospitable [desert,]{.mark}
[climate change has]{.mark} actually [been responsible for an explosion
of greenery on the planet]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Researchers at Boston
University have shown that]{.mark} over the last three decades, [31% of
the global vegetated area]{.mark} of the planet [has become]{.mark}
significantly [greener]{.mark}, with just 3% becoming less green---[an
increase they attribute]{.mark} primarily [to increased carbon dioxide
levels]{.mark} in the atmospher]{.underline}e[. Other [studies]{.mark},
such as this one [cited by NASA, show dramatic growth in]{.mark} up to
[50% of Earth's vegetated areas]{.mark} since the 1980s.]{.underline}
Even the IPCC predicts a worldwide increase in global timber supply from
forestry growth due to global warming.

Many argue that climate change will harm the world's poorest and
disproportionately affect places like Africa. What they don't tell you
is that [[the decline of famines in central Africa]{.mark} in recent
years [is]{.mark} partly [due to the increased rainfall caused
by]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, the entire
Sahel region of Africa has shown a huge increase in green vegetation
since the 1970s. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research
projects that due to global warming, the Sahel could receive 50% more
rain by 2040.

Lake Mega-Chad Will Return

Instead of solely eradicating land, global warming will cause the
world's geography to shift, like an internally moving temple in a Zelda
game, returning features to the planet only known from ancient memory.
As increased rains wallop the African continent, Lake Mega-Chad, once
the biggest freshwater lake on planet earth until possibly Roman times,
will swell into a new center of vitality on the African continent. Apart
from being epic and based, Mega-Chad and other emergent lakes will
provide fresh water for local communities and new habitats for plants
and animals.

Some Countries Will Become Wealthier

Far from only dealing negative damage to humanity, climate change
creates a new equilibrium, in which some nations experience losses and
other nations experience benefits. The United States is one country that
will benefit from at least moderate warming. The American public vastly
prefers warm weather to cold, and both death rates and healthcare costs
are lower in warmer states. In 1998, economist Thomas Moore estimated
that the net benefits to the United States of a warmer climate could be
as high as 1 percent of the GDP.

On the flip side, spending Brobdingnagian amounts of money or remaking
our societies to mitigate climate change appears to be massively
ineffective. The European Union's climate policies are estimated to cost
£1.8 trillion over the course of the century, just to lower the
temperature by about 0.005˚C---an undetectable amount to a normal
thermometer. The consensus among economists is that every £100 spent
fighting climate change brings £3 of benefit. That money could be better
spent investing in the world's poor, cleaning the oceans of
micro-plastics, or creating technology to adapt to global warming, to
name a few options.

Less People Might Die From Natural Disasters

Cold kills more people than heat. Countries like Britain and Greece see
mortality rates rise by as much as 18 per cent each winter. [[In
general, **warmer temperatures create more favorable conditions for
human populations** to grow.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[In the last 100
years]{.mark}, an unprecedented period of warming, [the death rate from
droughts, floods and storms has dropped by 98%, according to]{.mark} a
report by [scholar Indur Goklany.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In fact, a 2013 IPCC report says that while regional trends in cyclone
frequency have been observed in the North Atlantic since the 1970s,
"current data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global
tropical cyclone frequency over the past century and it remains
uncertain whether any reported long-term increases in tropical cyclone
frequency are robust." The paper goes on to say that "consistent with
the majority of studies performed for higher degrees of global warming,
the total number of tropical cyclones is projected to decrease under
global warming, whilst the most intense (categories 4 and 5) cyclones
are projected to occur more frequently." While we will definitely
experience calamities as the temperature rises, they happen frequently
at our current temperature, happened frequently in the past, and would
arguably be more deadly if the Earth experienced a cooldown.

[**[Africa matters]{.mark}** in terms of **size**, **population**, and
rate of **population growth**. [It]{.mark}]{.underline} is the continent
currently most affected by climate change but [is]{.underline} also [a
continent that [can have a **devastating impact**]{.mark} on **climate
change [globally]{.mark}** [because of]{.mark} the [importance of the
**Congo**]{.mark} **Basin** [rainforest]{.mark}, which is the
second-largest absorber of heat after the Amazon rainforest. The
destruction of this important ecosystem could further accelerate
**global warming**]{.underline}. As residents of the region come into
increasing contact with the animals of the rainforest, [this [region
could be the origin of the]{.mark} world's [next]{.mark} **viral
[pandemic]{.mark}**. Violent [extremism and terrorism]{.mark} are

[has]{.mark} the [potential to **spread**]{.mark} **beyond the
continent**. **Crises**]{.underline}---natural and man-made---cause
massive relocations of populations, both on the continent and abroad,
which [can have **negative economic, social, and political
impacts**]{.underline}.

Why Africa Matters

The African continent is the world's second-largest, with the
second-fastest growth rate after Asia. With 54 sovereign countries, four
territories, and two de facto independent states with little
international recognition, the continent has a current population of 1.3
billion. By 2050, the continent's population is predicted to rise to 2.4
billion. By 2100, [**[Nigeria]{.mark}**, Africa's most populous country,
[will have]{.mark} a population [of **one
billion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and half the world's population growth
will be in Africa by then.

The population of African countries is also overwhelmingly young.
Approximately 40% of Africans are under 15, and, in some countries, over
50% is under 25. By 2050, two of every five children born in the world
will be in Africa, and the continent's population is expected to triple.
These developments have positive and negative potential impacts on the
United States and the rest of the world. Young Africans have, for the
most part, completely skipped the analog age and gone directly digital.
Comfortable with technology, they form a huge potential consumer and
labor market. [If]{.underline}, on the other hand, the [countries of
Africa fail to develop economically]{.underline} and do not create
gainful employment for this young population, then there is the risk
that [they will become a huge potential source of recruits to extremist
and terrorist movements]{.underline}, which currently target
disadvantaged and disenchanted youth.

Lack of economic opportunity, increased urbanization, and climate-fueled
disasters will also contribute to movement of people seeking better
lives, which will impact economies and security not only on the
continent of Africa, but also the economic and security situations
around the world. [Nations, lacking]{.underline} adequate critical
infrastructure, education, and [**job opportunities** are ripe for
**internal unrest** and **radicalization**]{.underline}. In particular,
inadequate health delivery systems, when coupled with natural disasters,
such as droughts or floods that limit food production, cause famine and
mass movements of populations.

The Challenges for U.S. Policy

Prior to World War II, the U.S. policy towards Africa was not as active
as it was toward Europe, Asia, or Latin America. During the Cold War,
Africa policy was primarily viewed from a perspective of super-power
competition. The end of the Cold War and the rise of international
terrorism introduced this as a major component in U.S. Africa policy
along with competition with a rising China and increased Chinese
engagement in Africa.

Before his first official trip to Kenya, U.S. President Barack Obama
said, "Africa had become an idea more than an actual place . . . with
the benefit of distance, we engaged Africa in a selective embrace." This
is probably an apt description of U.S. policy towards African nations
despite the bipartisan nature of that policy. The United States, with
the many domestic and international issues it has to cope with, can ill
afford to continue to ignore Africa. Going forward, U.S. policy must
include a hard-headed look at where Africa fits in policy priorities.

The incoming Biden administration will face a number of important issues
and challenges as it develops its Africa policy. The most pressing
issues are the following:

Climate Change: Climate change is an existential problem that affects
the entire globe, but Africa has probably suffered more from the effects
of climate change than other continents---and the problem will only get
worse with time. In an October 2020 article, World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said,

Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent,
hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food
insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources. In
recent months we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert
locusts and now face the looming specter of drought because of a La Nina
event. The human and economic toll has been aggravated by the COVID-19
pandemic.

Climate change impacts water quality and availability, and millions in
Africa will likely face persistent increased water stress due to these
impacts. A multi-year drought in parts of South Africa, for instance,
threatened total water failure in several small towns and had livestock
farmers facing financial ruin. Another pressing climate-change issue is
the need for protection of the Congo Basin rainforest. This
178-million-hectare rainforest is the world's second largest after the
Amazon and is currently threatened by agricultural activities in
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Countries in the
Congo Basin need to address the preservation issue, while also enabling
sustainable agricultural activities to ensure food security for the
region's population. In addition to the impact on global climate caused
by destruction of the rainforest, such destruction also brings human
populations into closer contact with the region's animals, creating the
risk of future animal-to-human transmission of new and possibly more
virulent viruses similar to COVID-19, which will have a global impact.
In a January 2021 CNN report, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, who as a
researcher helped discover the Ebola virus in 1976, warned of possible
new pathogens that could be as infectious as COVID-19 and as virulent as
Ebola.

Rule of Law/Mitigation of Corruption: A key to African development,
given the increasing urbanization, population increases, and
youthfulness of the continent's population, will be an increase in
domestic and international investment to build the industries that can
provide meaningful employment and improved standards of living. In order
for this to be successful, African nations will need to address the
issues of rule of law and corruption. Investors will not risk money if
the business climate comes with a level of political risk that is too
high. Government leaders throughout Africa need to establish legislation
that provides an acceptable level of security for investments and take
action to curb the endemic corruption that currently discourages
investment. Corruption in Africa ranges from wholesale political
corruption on the scale of General Sani Abachi's looting of \$3-5
billion of state money during his five years as Nigeria's military ruler
to the bribes paid by businessmen to police and customs officials. The
"tradition" of having to pay bribes, or "sweeteners," drives away
domestic investment and scares away foreign investment, leaving many
countries mired in poverty.

Violent Extremism and Terrorism: A number of African nations are
currently plagued with rising extremist movements. While primarily a
domestic issue, the mass movement of people fleeing violence and the
disruption of economic activity have the potential to negatively impact
the rest of the world. African nations need regional responses to curb
extremist and terrorist organizations, many of which are supported by
international terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and al Qaeda. In
addition, the underlying conditions that helped to create these
movements must be addressed. [[Terrorist groups]{.mark} in Africa range
from relatively large and dangerous groups, [such as Boko
Haram]{.mark}]{.underline}, a group [[in
**Nigeria**]{.underline}]{.mark} that has received support from al Qaeda
and that aims to implement sharia law in the country; Al-Shabab, an al
Qaeda affiliate aiming to overthrow the government in Somalia and to
punish neighboring countries for their support of the Somali regime; and
Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army, a fundamentalist Christian group.
Terrorist groups in the fragile political climate of Libya also pose a
threat to sub-Saharan Africa.

**[[Great Power Competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**: As the world's
second-largest economy, and with its increasing participation in
international activities, [[**China** will]{.mark} continue to [be a
factor]{.mark} in Africa for the foreseeable future]{.underline}. This,
however, is more a problem for the nations of Africa than it is for the
rest of the world. The West can compete best by outperforming China in
areas of strength by providing those goods and services that are
unquestionably superior, and let African governments decide how to deal
with China and its often-predatory lending practices and the Chinese
tendency to import Chinese workers for its projects and investments
rather than hiring locals. At the same time, Russia, which did not
completely turn away from Africa at the end of the Cold War as many in
the West sometimes believe, must still be considered a significant
factor on the African landscape. In an effort to compensate for Western
sanctions and to counter U.S. and Western influence, [[**Russia**
is]{.mark} once again [increasing]{.mark} its [presence]{.mark} on the
continent]{.underline}. Russian mercenaries, in exchange for diamond
mining rights, have trained military forces in the Central African
Republic, raising concerns about human rights abuses. Of particular
concern is the presence of the Wagner Group, a private military company
associated with Yevgeny Progozhin, a Russian oligarch with close ties to
Vladimir Putin, who was indicted in the United States for trying to
disrupt the 2016 U.S. elections. To date, Russia has, in addition to
seeking basing rights, signed military cooperation agreements with 28
African nations. Russian activity is a combination of military and
commercial, with Progozhin at the center of both. From 2010 to 2018,
Russia nearly tripled its trade with African countries. While the
activities of both Russia and China in Africa are of concern, and should
be closely monitored, neither is of critical importance to U.S. national
security.

With climate change, disease outbreaks, famine, extremism, and
inter-ethnic violence, Africa will still experience crises in the
foreseeable future that will be beyond the capacity of most nations on
the continent to deal with. Climate change is probably the greatest
cause of humanitarian crises in Africa, but mainstream media outside the
continent either fail to notice or under-report them. Some of the
[crises]{.underline}, like Ebola or the next viral infection, [can
**impact** the **rest of the world**]{.underline}. These crises will
cause starvation, mass movement of people, and increase internal and
regional instability. [[Africa matters to]{.mark} the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and [the **rest of the
world**]{.mark}. Its impacts can be felt **far beyond the continent's
borders**]{.underline}, but if approached as a partner rather than as a
patron---with a focus on assisting African nations to improve
governance, build critical infrastructure, boost domestic economies, and
provide essential services to all---then Africa can be a positive
contributor on the global stage.

### Warming Good\-\--Food\-\--Link\-\--2NC

#### Warming [solves]{.underline} famine. CO2's effects are [empirically pronounced]{.underline}.

**Ridley 22**, Matt, author of How Innovation Works: And Why It
Flourishes in Freedom "Why Climate Change Is Good for the World." The
Spectator, 17 Sept. 2022,

[There are many [likely effects of **climate change**]{.mark}: positive
and negative, economic and ecological, humanitarian and financial. And
[if you **aggregate**]{.mark} them all, [the]{.mark} **overall
[effect]{.mark}** [is **positive**]{.mark} today]{.underline} --- and
likely to stay positive until around 2080. That was the conclusion of
Professor Richard Tol of Sussex University after he reviewed 14
different studies of the effects of future climate trends.

To be precise, [Prof Tol calculated that climate change would be
beneficial up to 2.2˚C of warming]{.underline} from 2009 (when he wrote
his paper). This means approximately 3˚C from pre-industrial levels,
since about 0.8˚C of warming has happened in the last 150 years. [The
latest estimates of climate sensitivity suggest that such
**[temp]{.mark}**erature[**s** may not be reached till the **end** of
the **century**]{.mark} --- if at all.]{.underline} The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose reports define the
consensis, is sticking to older assumptions, however, which would mean
net benefits till about 2080. Either way, it's a long way off.

Now Prof Tol has a new paper, published as a chapter in a new book,
called How Much have Global Problems Cost the World?, which is edited by
Bjorn Lomborg, director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre, and was
reviewed by a group of **[[leading economists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
this paper he casts his gaze backwards to the last century. He
[[concludes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**climate change** did]{.mark}
indeed [raise]{.mark} human and planetary **[welfare]{.mark}** during
the 20th century.]{.underline}

You can choose not to believe the studies Prof Tol has collated. Or you
can say the net benefit is small (which it is), you can argue that the
benefits have accrued more to rich countries than poor countries (which
is true) or you can emphasise that after 2080 climate change would
probably do net harm to the world (which may also be true). You can even
say you do not trust the models involved (though they have proved more
reliable than the temperature models). But what you cannot do is deny
that this is the current consensus. If you wish to accept the consensus
on temperature models, then you should accept the consensus on economic
benefit.

Overall, Prof Tol finds that climate change in the past century improved
human welfare. By how much? He calculates by 1.4 per cent of global
economic output, rising to 1.5 per cent by 2025. For some people, this
means the difference between survival and starvation.

It will still be 1.2 per cent around 2050 and will not turn negative
until around 2080. In short, my children will be very old before global
warming stops benefiting the world. Note that if the world continues to
grow at 3 per cent a year, then the average person will be about nine
times as rich in 2080 as she is today. So low-lying Bangladesh will be
able to afford the same kind of flood defences that the Dutch have
today.

The chief benefits of global warming include: fewer winter deaths; lower
energy costs; better agricultural yields; probably fewer droughts; maybe
richer biodiversity. It is a little-known fact that winter deaths exceed
summer deaths --- not just in countries like Britain but also those with
very warm summers, including Greece. Both Britain and Greece see
mortality rates rise by 18 per cent each winter. Especially cold winters
cause a rise in heart failures far greater than the rise in deaths
during heatwaves.

Cold, not the heat, is the biggest killer. For the last decade, Brits
have been dying from the cold at the average rate of 29,000 excess
deaths each winter. Compare this to the heatwave ten years ago, which
claimed 15,000 lives in France and just 2,000 in Britain. In the ten
years since, there has been no summer death spike at all. Excess winter
deaths hit the poor harder than the rich for the obvious reason: they
cannot afford heating. And it is not just those at risk who benefit from
moderate warming. Global warming has so far cut heating bills more than
it has raised cooling bills. If it resumes after its current 17-year
hiatus, and if the energy efficiency of our homes improves, then at some
point the cost of cooling probably will exceed the cost of heating ---
probably from about 2035, Prof Tol estimates.

The greatest benefit from climate change comes not from temperature
change but from **[[carbon dioxide]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself. It
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not pollution, but [the raw material from
which plants make carbohydrates and thence proteins and
fats]{.underline}. As it [is an [**extremely rare** trace]{.mark} gas in
the air]{.underline} --- [less than 0.04 per cent of the air on
average]{.underline} --- [[plants **struggle**]{.mark} to absorb enough
of it]{.underline}. On a windless, sunny day, a [field of corn can suck
**half** the carbon dioxide out of the air]{.underline}. Commercial
greenhouse operators therefore pump carbon dioxide into their
greenhouses to raise plant growth rates.

[[The **increase**]{.underline}]{.mark} in average carbon dioxide levels
over the past century, from 0.03 per cent to 0.04 per cent of the air,
[[has had a **measurable impact** on]{.mark} plant **[growth]{.mark}**
rates. It is [responsible for]{.mark} a [**startling change** in]{.mark}
the amount of **[greenery]{.mark}** on the planet.]{.underline} As Dr
Ranga Myneni of Boston University has documented, using three decades of
satellite data, 31 per cent of the global vegetated area of the planet
has become greener and just 3 per cent has become less green. This
[translates into a [14 per cent **increase** in **productivity** of
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} and has been observed in all vegetation
types.

Dr Randall Donohue and colleagues of the CSIRO Land and Water department
in Australia also analysed satellite data and found greening to be
clearly attributable in part to the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect.
[[Greening is **especially pronounced** in]{.mark} dry areas like the
Sahel region of **[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}, where satellites show
a big increase in green vegetation since the 1970s.

This is probably the most memed benefit of global

The arrival of [**[intense cold]{.mark}** similar to]{.underline} the
one raged during [the]{.underline} \"Little **[[Ice
Age]{.underline}]{.mark}**\", [which [froze the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} during the XVII century and in the beginning
of the XVIII century, [is [**expected** in]{.mark} the years
**[2030]{.mark}\--2040**. These [conclusions]{.mark} were presented
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} Prof. V.Zharkova (Northumbria University)
during the National Astronomy Meeting in Llandudno in Wales by the
[[**international** group of **scientists**]{.mark},]{.underline} which
also includes Dr Helen Popova of the Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear
Physics and of the Faculty of Physics of the Lomonosov Moscow State
University, professor Simon Shepherd of Bradford University (UK) and Dr
Sergei Zharkov of Hull University (UK).

It is known, that [[the Sun has]{.mark} its]{.underline} own
**[[magnetic fie]{.mark}ld]{.underline}**, the amplitude and spatial
configuration of which vary with time. The [formation and decay of
strong magnetic]{.underline} fields in the solar atmosphere
[[results]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the changes of electromagnetic
**[radiation]{.mark}** from the Sun,]{.underline} of the intensity of
plasma flows coming from the Sun, and the number of sunspots on the
Sun\'s surface. [The **[study]{.mark}** of changes in the number of
**[sunspots]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the Sun\'s surface [[has **a
cyclic structure**]{.mark} vary in every 11 years that is also
**imposed** on the Earth **environment**]{.underline} as the analysis of
carbon-14, beryllium-10 and other isotopes in glaciers and in the trees
showed.

There are several cycles with different periods and properties, while
the 11-year cycle, the 90-year cycle are the best known of them. The
11-year cycle appears as a cyclical reduction in stains on the surface
of the Sun every 11 years. Its 90-year variation is associated with
periodic reduction in the number of spots in the 11-year cycle in the
50-25%. In 17th century though there was a prolonged of the solar
activity called the Maunder minimum, which lasted roughly from 1645 to
1700. During this period, there were only about 50 sunspots instead of
the usual 40-50 thousand sunspots. Analysis of solar radiation showed
that its maxima and minima almost coincide with the maxima and minima in
the number of spots.

In the current study published in 3 peer-reviewed papers the researchers
analyzed a total background magnetic field from full disk magnetograms
for three [cycles of solar activity (21-23]{.underline}) by applying the
so-called \"principal component analysis\", which allows to reduce the
data dimensionality and noise and to identify waves with the largest
contribution to the observational data. This method can be compared with
the decomposition of white light on the rainbow prism detecting the
waves of different frequencies. As a result, the researchers [developed
a new method of analysis]{.underline}, which helped to uncover, that the
magnetic waves in the Sun are generated in pairs, with the main pair
covering 40% of variance of the data (Zharkova et al, 2012, MNRAS). The
principal component pair is responsible for the variations of a dipole
field of the Sun, which is changing its polarity from pole to pole
during 11 year solar activity.

The magnetic waves travel from the opposite hemisphere to the Northern
hemisphere (odd cycles) or to Southern hemisphere (even cycles), with
the phase shift between the waves increasing with a cycle number. The
waves interacts with each other in the hemisphere where they have
maximum (Northern for odd cycles and Southern for even ones). These two
components are assumed to originate in two different layers in the solar
interior (inner and outer) with close, but not equal, frequencies and a
variable phase shift (Popova et al, 2013, AnnGeo).

The scientists managed to derive [the analytical
[formula]{.mark}]{.underline}, describing the evolution of these two
waves and calculated the summary curve which was linked to the
variations of sunspot numbers, the original proxy of solar activity, if
one used the modulus of the summary curve (Shepherd et al, 2014, ApJ).
By using this formula the scientist[s made first the
**[prediction]{.mark}** of magnetic activity in the cycle 24, which
[gave **97% accuracy**]{.mark} in comparison]{.underline} with the
principal components derived from the observations.

[Inspired]{.underline} by this success[, the authors
**[extended]{.mark}** the prediction]{.underline} of these two magnetic
waves [[to the **next** two]{.mark} cycle]{.underline} 25 and 26 [and
[discovered]{.mark}]{.underline} that the waves become fully separated
into the opposite hemispheres in cycle 26 and thus have little chance of
interacting and producing sunspot numbers. This will lead to [[a **sharp
decline**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} solar **[activity]{.mark}** in years
2030 - 2040]{.underline} comparable with the conditions existed
previously during the Maunder minimum in the XVII century when there
were only about 50-70 sunspots observed instead of the usual 40-50
thousand expected.

The new reduction of the solar activity will lead to reduction of the
solar irradiance by 3W/m\^2 according to Lean (1997). This resulted in
[**[significant cooling]{.mark}** of Earth and very [**severe winters**
and cold **summers**]{.mark}. \"]{.underline}Several studies have shown
that the Maunder Minimum coincided with the coldest phase of global
cooling, which was called \"the Little Ice Age\". During this period
there were [very cold winters in Europe and North America.]{.underline}
In the days of the Maunder minimum the water in the river Thames and the
Danube River froze, the Moscow River was covered by ice every six
months, snow lay on some plains year round and Greenland was **[[covered
by glaciers]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" - says Dr Helen Popova, who
developed a unique physical-mathematical model of the evolution of the
magnetic activity of the sun and used it to gain the patterns of
occurrence of global minima of solar activity and gave them a physical
interpretation.

If the [similar **reduction** will be observed [during the
upcoming]{.mark} Maunder [minimum]{.mark} this can lead to the similar
**cooling** of the Earth **atmosphere**]{.underline}. According to Dr
Helen Popova, if the existing theories about the impact of solar
activity on the climate are true, then [this minimum will [lead to a
**significant** cooling]{.mark}]{.underline}, similar to the one
occurred during the Maunder minimum.

However, only the time will show soon enough [([**within** the **next
5**]{.mark}**-15 [years]{.mark}**]{.underline}) if this will happen.

\"Given that [our future minimum will last for]{.underline} at least
three solar cycles, which is [about 30 years]{.underline}, it is
possible, that the lowering of the temperature will not be as deep as
during the Maunder minimum. But we will have to [examine it in
**detail**]{.underline}. We keep in touch [with **climatologists** from
different countries.]{.underline} We plan to work in this direction\",
\-- Dr Helen Popova said.

Despite warming temperatures worldwide, scientists are exploring Earth's
ancient cold snaps. [Researching]{.underline} how [[**past** ice
ages]{.mark} ended can [reveal clues about]{.mark} our planet's
**[future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Some of the evidence suggests that [[we might be **overdue**]{.mark} for
an ice age, in fact, [according to **glaciologist**]{.mark}]{.underline}
Brenda [Hall]{.underline} of the University of Maine.

Hall's [research shows that ancient [glaciers]{.mark} might have
[retreated]{.mark} rapidly [as part of Earth's **natural
pattern**]{.mark} of ice ages. The Earth's previous]{.underline} warming
[periods]{.underline} and the current [one can be traced to a global
rise in air temperature---with one key difference]{.underline}.

"One was a big, end-of-the-ice-age warming," said Hall, whose team
conducted the research in the Tierra del Fuego, Chile. "The other is
[warming]{.underline} over the last century, some of which is natural
warming and some of which [is **human-induced**]{.underline}."

Most of this human-induced warming is related to carbon dioxide, a
greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. Gasoline, coal and
natural gas are all carbon-based and burning them for fuel emits carbon
dioxide.

[[Things]{.mark} can **[change fast]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ice sheets
in the Andes melted down to modern glaciers "in less than a thousand
years, which, from a geologic point of view, is really fast," Hall said.
Hall, an associate professor at the University of Maine, presented her
research at the Comer Conference on Abrupt Climate Change in Wisconsin
earlier this October.

Her research set out to discover how and why ice ages ended in the
Southern Hemisphere, using glaciers in the Cordillera Darwin range of
the Andes at the tip of South America. These high mountains still host
remnants of a massive ice sheet from the last ice age. The research used
geological features and peat bog cores to date the start of a warming
period that led to the end of last the ice age 18,000 years ago.

The ice melted much faster, as it turns out, than scientists had
thought. According to Hall, the ice sheet was so extensive at end of the
ice age that its mass became unsustainable. As the ice became unstable
and air temperature began warming, the glaciers made a rapid retreat.

While scientists know that the Earth goes through periods of warming and
cooling, and that the human contribution to climate change is now
causing more dramatic warming, not everything is clear. Hall said
scientists are still trying to understand the Earth's "natural climate
variability" in order to better predict the effects of human-driven
climate change.

One such effect may be that **[human-caused [warming is delaying an
overdue ice age]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Hall's [[research dated]{.mark}
the beginning of [the end of the last]{.mark} ice age [to **18,000
years**]{.mark} **ago**, [but "interglacials"]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
the periods of relative warmth between glacial periods of an ice
age---[usually [last **only 15,000**]{.mark} **years**, [meaning we're
**overdue** for **a**]{.mark}**nother [cold snap]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Warming Good\-\--Ice Age\-\--Impact\-\--2NC 

#### Ice age is [objectively]{.underline} extinction. 

Randall **Munroe 22**. independent science author and researcher, former
NASA employee, BS in Physics from Christopher Newport University. "What
if we entered a new Ice Age?" What If,
https://whatifshow.com/what-if-we-entered-a-new-ice-age/.

Earth has gone through at least five major ice ages in its history. And
you better start adapting now. Because [another [**ice age** is about to
**begin**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hypothetically. How would a new ice age
[**[change Earth]{.mark}** as we know it]{.underline}? What could you do
to survive on [a frozen planet]{.underline}? And how are we already
delaying another ice age?

During all ice ages in Earth's history, global
[**[temperatures]{.mark}**]{.underline} dropped [well **[below
freezing]{.mark}** across the planet]{.underline}. And it wasn't just a
few icy trips around the Sun. [[Earth]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[take]{.mark} hundreds of **[millions]{.mark}** of years [to
**thaw**]{.mark} out.]{.underline} The most recent ice age started the
Quartenary period about 2.6 million years ago. And technically, we're
still in it today.

Ice ages have the power to [radically change our planet. They
[**reshape** landscapes]{.mark}]{.underline}. They create new lakes and
rivers. [Plants and [animals]{.mark}]{.underline} cling to life, either
adapting or [[facing]{.mark} **[extinction]{.mark}**.]{.underline} So,
if a new ice age began today, how [soon]{.underline} would [our
**[civilization collapse]{.mark}** into chilly **chaos**?]{.underline}

Our sixth major ice age would be a few thousand years in the making. And
[it would begin with]{.underline} Earth's tilt on its axis going through
its cycle of changes[. An unstable tilt plus a little wobble in our
orbit around the Sun, and]{.underline} there would be [less]{.underline}
and less [**solar radiation** reaching the planet.]{.underline} You'd
see the first effects of this on the Northern Hemisphere.

Each year, once lovely [summer **temperatures**]{.underline} would start
to [drop.]{.underline} Eventually, they'd [**fail** to rise above
**freezing**.]{.underline} That's when [snowfall would begin to
build]{.underline} up. Over time, that snow would compress into ice
sheets. These glaciers would start in places like the northernmost
regions of Canada, Scandinavia and Russia. And they would spread from
there.

The ice would mostly form on dry land. That's because the water
surrounding the ice would create a barrier preventing it from expanding
as easily. Today, about 10% of Earth's land surface is covered by ice.
As our new ice age progresses, you could see that go up to about 25%.
Ice would cover Eurasia from the British Isles to Siberia.

Himalayan ice sheets would [[expand through
**Asia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And while the [**Southern
Hemisphere**]{.underline} wouldn't be as icy, an ice sheet would run
from the southern tip of Patagonia well into the Andes Mountains. But
ice wouldn't be the only change. [**[Sea levels]{.mark}** could
**[drop]{.mark}** around 120 m (]{.underline}394 ft) lower than they are
now. This could [[close off the Mediterranean]{.mark} Sea to the
Atlantic]{.underline} Ocean.

Without anywhere else to go, rainfall and glacial melting would feed
bodies of water in regions that aren't frozen over. Some rivers would
also change their usual runoffs and form new lakes. With all these
changes in sea levels around the world, land bridges would re-emerge.
Russia would now be connected to Alaska, and the islands of Indonesia
would connect to mainland Southeast Asia.

The borders would change and bring many countries closer together. Or it
would result in whole new countries being formed, opening up new land
for you to migrate to. And you'd need to.
[**[Regions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that you and hundreds of millions of
other people used to call home [would now be]{.underline} essentially
[**[uninhabitable]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Surviving the cold would mean moving away from the iciest parts of North
America and Eurasia. But [the rest of the world wouldn't be]{.underline}
too [welcoming]{.underline} either[. It would [get]{.mark} really
**[dry]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Deserts and tundras would expand, so the
remaining tropical forests near the equator would be refuges for much of
the planet's plant and animal life.

But what about us? During the most recent ice age, we actually developed
as species. The land bridges allowed us to spread out across the globe.
The climate forced us to adapt with new tools and clothing. And as Earth
re-warmed, we started farming. I[t's [likely we wouldn't
fare]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[well]{.mark} with a new ice
age.]{.underline} Not right away, at least. [Almost all of our
**[agr]{.mark}icultural** land [would be **lost**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

So [[intense **overcrowding**]{.mark}]{.underline} in hospitable regions
would [[create **chaos** and]{.mark} unrest.]{.underline} You should get
ready for [[**extreme competition** for]{.mark} life's basic
**[necessities]{.mark}**. [But]{.mark}]{.underline} I have good news to
ease your worries about this frigid doomsday scenario. Well, sort of.
Based on current [[climate]{.mark} science [and]{.mark} the amount of
**[carbon dioxide]{.mark}** in our atmosphere,]{.underline} we may have
[**[postpone]{.mark}d**]{.underline} the next possible [ice age
[by]{.mark} about [**500,000 years**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

responsible for keeping the UK and Western Europe balmy]{.mark}. Recent
studies indicate that the cold water [outflow of the North Atlantic has

become]{.mark} progressively [less saline]{.mark}. Unfortunately, [these

only one part of a worldwide system]{.mark}; disrupting them may bring
dramatic climate change to the entire planet.]{.underline} -- YaleGlobal
Will Global Warming Trigger a New Ice Age? If climate change disrupts
ocean currents, things could get very chilly round here Bill McGuire
Thursday, November 13, 2003 If you can remember back to the bitter
winters of the late 1970s and early 80s you might also recall that there
was much discussion in scientific circles at the time about whether or
not the freezing winter conditions were a portent of a new ice age. Over
the past couple of decades such warnings have been drowned out by the
great global warming debate and by consideration of how society might
cope in future with a sweltering planet rather than an icebound one.
Seemingly, the fact that we are still within an interglacial period,
during which the ice has largely retreated to its polar fastnesses, has
been forgotten - and replaced with the commonly-held view that one good
thing you can say about global warming is that it will at least stave
off the return of the glaciers. Is this really true, or could [[the
rapidly accelerating warming]{.mark} that we are experiencing [actually
hasten the onset of a new ice age]{.mark}? A growing body of [evidence
suggests that]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least for the UK and western
Europe, [[there is a serious risk of this happening]{.mark} - and
soon]{.underline}. The problem lies with the ocean current known as the
Gulf Stream, which bathes the UK and north-west Europe in warm water
carried northwards from the Caribbean. It is the Gulf Stream, and
associated currents, that allow strawberries to thrive along the
Norwegian coast, while at comparable latitudes in Greenland glaciers
wind their way right down to sea level. The same currents permit palms
to flourish in Cornwall and the Hebrides, whereas across the ocean in
Labrador, even temperate vegetation struggles to survive. [[Without the
Gulf Stream, temperatures]{.mark} in the UK and north-west Europe [would
be five degrees]{.mark} centigrade or so [cooler, with bitter winters at
least as fierce as]{.mark} those of [the]{.mark} so-called Little [Ice
Age]{.mark} in the 17th to 19th centuries.]{.underline} The Gulf Stream
is part of a more complex system of currents known by a number of
different names, of which the rather cumbersome North Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation (Namoc) is probably the most apt.
This incorporates not only the Gulf Stream but also the cold return
currents that convey water southwards again. As it approaches the
Arctic, the Gulf Stream loses heat and part of it heads back to warmer
climes along the coast of Greenland and eastern Canada in the form of
the cold, iceberg-laden current responsible for the loss of the Titanic.
Much, however, overturns - cooling and sinking beneath the Nordic seas
between Norway and Greenland, before heading south again deep below the
surface. [In the past, [the slowing of the Gulf Stream]{.mark} has been
intimately [linked with dramatic]{.mark}]{.underline} regional
[[cooling]{.mark}. Just [10,000 years ago]{.mark}, during a climatic
cold snap known as the Younger Dryas[, the current was]{.mark} severely
[weakened, causing]{.mark}]{.underline} northern European
[[temp]{.mark}eratures [to fall by]{.mark} as much [as 10
degrees]{.mark}. Ten thousand years before that, at the height of the
last ice age, when most of the UK was reduced to a frozen wasteland, the
Gulf Stream had just two-thirds of the strength it has now.]{.underline}
What\'s worrying is that for some years now, global [[climate
models]{.mark} have been [predicting]{.mark} a future [weakening of the
Gulf Stream as a consequence of global warming]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Such models visualise the disruption of the Namoc, including the Gulf
Stream, as a result of large-scale melting of Arctic ice and the
consequent pouring of huge volumes of fresh water into the North
Atlantic, in a century or two. New data suggest, however, that [we may
not have to wait centuries, and in fact]{.underline} [[the whole process
may be happening already.]{.mark}]{.underline} So that the warm, saline
surface waters of the Gulf Stream can continue to push northwards, there
must be a comparable, deep return current of cold, dense water from the
Nordic seas. Disturbingly, this return current seems to have been
slowing since the middle of the last century. Bogi Hansen at the Faroese
fisheries laboratory, and colleagues in Scotland and Norway, have been
monitoring the deep outflow of cold water from the Nordic seas as it
passes over the submarine Greenland-Scotland ridge that straddles the
North Atlantic at this point. Their results show that the outflow has
fallen by 20% since 1950, which suggests a comparable reduced inflow
from the Gulf Stream. Although there is as yet no direct substantiation
of this, and his colleagues point to reports of the cooling and
freshening of the Norwegian Sea and to temperatures that are already
falling in parts of the region as possible evidence of contemporary Gulf
Stream weakening. It also seems that it is not only the intensity of the
outflow of cold water that is changing. Bob Dickson of the Centre for
Environment, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Science at Lowestoft, and
colleagues, have reported a sustained and widespread freshening of
returning deep waters south of the Greenland-Scotland ridge, which
appears to have been going on for the past three or four decades.
Already the freshening is extending along the North American eastern
seaboard towards the equator, in the so-called Deep Western Boundary
current. One of the scariest aspects of the current dramatic changes
occurring in the system of North Atlantic currents is that the deep,
southward-flowing limb of the Namoc can be thought of as representing
the headwaters of the worldwide system of ocean currents known as the
Global Thermohaline Circulation. The possibility exists, therefore, that
a disruption of the Atlantic currents might have implications far beyond
a colder UK and north-west Europe, perhaps bringing dramatic climatic
changes to the entire planet. Yet again, this highlights the fact that
global warming, for which we have only ourselves to thank, is nothing
more nor less than a great planetary experiment, many of the outcomes of
which we cannot predict. Wallace Broecker, an ocean circulation
researcher at New York\'s Lamont-Doherty Earth observatory, described
the situation perfectly when he pointed out that \"climate is an angry
beast and we are poking at it with sticks\". Let\'s hope that when it

The idea of a new "Little Ice Age" is a topic that has sparked curiosity
and debate among scientists and the public alike. Historically, Ice Ages
were long, slow transitions into colder climates, driven by natural
factors like Earth's orbit and axial tilt. However, the current global
warming trend, driven largely by human activity, complicates these
patterns, introducing a paradox: could human-induced climate change
actually lead to a new cooling period? To understand this paradox, we
need to dive into both past climate patterns and the mechanics of how
Earth's climate system operates today. The natural Ice Age cycle For
millions of years, Earth's climate has followed a cyclical pattern
between glacial and interglacial periods. These cycles are primarily
governed by variations in Earth's orbit and axial tilt, a phenomenon
known as Milankovitch cycles. Every 100,000 years or so, these changes
in Earth's position relative to the Sun lead to long periods of cooling
(glacials) and warming (interglacials). We are currently living in an
interglacial period, the Holocene, which began around 11,700 years ago
after the last Ice Age. During these cycles, Earth's climate would
gradually shift between colder and warmer states, affecting everything
from ice distribution to ocean and atmospheric circulation. However, the
warming we are experiencing today is not following the typical slow
trajectory of these natural cycles. Instead, it is happening at an
accelerated pace, largely due to human activities like burning fossil
fuels and deforestation. The paradox of global warming and cooling
Though we often hear about global warming and its potential to cause
havoc with our climate, there's a surprising twist to the story: some
scientists are concerned that [[global warming could]{.mark} potentially
[trigger a cooling period]{.mark}, akin to [a "New]{.mark} Little [Ice
Age."]{.mark}]{.underline} This scenario might seem counterintuitive,
but [[evidence suggests that changes in the ocean's circulation could be
a key factor.]{.mark} At the heart of the climate system is [the great
ocean conveyor]{.mark}, a network of ocean currents that
transport]{.underline} warm [water from the equator to the]{.underline}
poles and return cold water from the poles to the equator[. This system
[helps regulate the Earth's climate by balancing temperature differences
between the equator and the poles.]{.mark}]{.underline} One key
component of this process is the formation of dense, cold water in the
North Atlantic, which sinks and drives the conveyor belt of ocean
currents. [[However, this]{.mark} system [can be disrupted]{.mark} if
large amounts of fresh water are added to the North Atlantic, as has
happened in the past [due to rapid melting of polar ice or
glaciers]{.mark}.]{.underline} The fresh water dilutes the salty
seawater, making it less dense and preventing it from sinking. [If this
process were to slow or stop entirely, the ocean conveyor could be
weakened, leading to a significant cooling in the Northern Hemisphere.
In fact, some models suggest that such a [disruption could lead to a
temp]{.mark}erature [drop of]{.mark} 3 to [5 degrees]{.mark} Celsius,
[similar to]{.mark} the temperature [changes experienced during the
Little Ice Age]{.mark}]{.underline} (which lasted from the 16th to the
19th century). The Little Ice Age and its impacts The Little Ice Age was
a period of cooler temperatures that had profound effects on human
societies, particularly in Europe and North America. It was marked by
cooler summers, harsh winters, and shorter growing seasons, which caused
crop failures, famines, and social unrest. This period is often cited as
an example of how abrupt climate changes can dramatically affect human
life. One of the key events of the Little Ice Age was the so-called
[**["Younger Dryas,"]{.underline}** **[a sudden]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[and extreme cooling event]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[occurred around
12,000 years ago.]{.underline}]{.mark} The abruptness of this shift
caught scientists' attention, as it seemed out of sync with the gradual
changes expected from orbital cycles. The cause of the Younger Dryas
remains a mystery, but many scientists believe it [[was triggered by the
disruption of ocean currents,]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly in the
North Atlantic. Please also read: Story of Holocene wilderness The
modern climate crisis While the idea of [**a "New Little Ice
Age"**]{.underline} is intriguing, the present-day climate crisis is
driven by different forces than those that triggered past Ice Ages. In
the past, changes in Earth's orbit and axial tilt gradually shifted the
planet's climate. Today, however, human activity---specifically the
burning of fossil fuels---has [rapidly [increased]{.mark} the
concentration of carbon dioxide ([CO2]{.mark}) in the atmosphere, which
has [led to global warming at an unprecedented
rate]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This modern warming is occurring much faster
than the gradual transitions between glacial and interglacial periods,
and ecosystems and [human s]{.mark}ocieties are struggling to adapt to
these rapid changes.]{.underline} For instance, while past warming
events allowed species and ecosystems thousands of years to adjust[, the
speed of current warming means that many species [are unable to adapt
fast enough]{.mark}, leading to disruptions in ecosystems around the
world.]{.underline} The dramatic difference in the speed of temperature
changes is one of the key reasons why scientists are so concerned. [In
just the past century, human activities have caused CO2 levels to rise
at a rate approximately 100 times faster than the natural warming that
occurred at the end of the last Ice Age. This rapid pace leaves little
time for natural processes to adjust[, leading to]{.mark}]{.underline}
potentially [[catastrophic consequences.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
Ocean's role in future climate As researchers study the current and
future climate, they are increasingly focusing on the oceans and their
role in regulating global temperatures. Changes in oceanic salinity and
temperature could play a crucial role in triggering or preventing a new
cooling period.
