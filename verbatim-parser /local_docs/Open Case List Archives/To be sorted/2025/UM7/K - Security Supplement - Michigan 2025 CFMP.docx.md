To conclude, this research has shown how [the security dilemma is
affected by **threats** and **perceptions**]{.underline}, and how
historical events play a role when undergone a [process of **fuelling
insecurities** and the **social construction** of threats]{.underline}.
Starting with the Russian Federation and conducting a qualitative
analysis of the speeches and doctrines available from 2007 (the year
used as a benchmark for Russia's activities in the Arctic), focusing in
2014 and 2022 as major years, where a change was expected. Starting from
2014 securitization is identified as both the élite's discourse and the
doctrines identify a threat and envisage measures to counter it, but
still room for international cooperation is envisaged to keep the Arctic
peaceful. [With 2022, the **securitization** of the Arctic increased,
**in parallel** with the security dilemma]{.underline}. [With little to
zero **dialogue** between the parties, the **feeling** of being
**threatened** by US/NATO's closeness increased]{.underline}. As regards
the US, on the other hand, the major change in the narrative occurred
after Obama's Presidency, when the focus on what threatens the national
security shifted from climate change to the necessity to increment the
military expenditures and the capabilities deployed.

This study emphasizes how [the **language used** is fundamental in the
**creation of threats**]{.underline}, and how [politicians have the
**choice** to **construct the menace**]{.underline}. [**Contrary** to
the realist view of the security dilemma as an **inherent feature** of
the international system]{.underline}, the theory of [securitization
**shows** that the threats are **socially constructed**]{.underline},
and how [politicians have the **choice** to **mitigate** the security
dilemma]{.underline}. To answer to the initial research question, "How
does securitization in the Arctic region affect the security dilemma?",
the main takeaway of this work is that [**threats**, **perceptions** and
the **lack of dialogue** contribute to the **deepening** of the
SD.]{.underline} It outlines how [threats are **constructed** and the
role played by **fear** and **lack of trust**]{.underline}. Dual-use
capabilities are at the centre of warfare and fear and supposition of
the 'adversary's use of them are a key element in choosing whether or
not securitize a certain geographical region. While the transfer of
findings of this thesis is not completely possible, it increases the
applicability of the theory of securitization. In fact, it showed how
[historical events are **not directly** influencing the SD, but it
depends on the **actor's choices** and how they **construct**
threats]{.underline}. In this work, [securitization is intended as a
**combination** of processes, and regrouping them by time frames and
years has given an understanding of how the élite framed the
threat.]{.underline}

[The **establishment** of **democratic peace**]{.underline} nonetheless
[had **exclusionary effects**]{.underline}. [If democracy]{.underline}
was what **[secures]{.underline}** [democratic states, non-democratic
states were **excluded**]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} indirectly
**[blamed]{.underline}** [for war]{.underline}. Mark Rupert (2001: 154)
and John MacMillan (1998: 23--26) argue that [democratic peace leads to
a **normalization of violence** between democratic and non-democratic
states]{.underline}. The [**non-democratic nature** of the opposing
state can be held **responsible** for causing **any violence** that
occurs]{.underline}. For MacMillan (1998: 23), [democratic peace gives
**'"absolution"** for that **violence** which does **occur** between
liberal and nonliberal states]{.underline}.' [Creating the **certainty**
of democratic peace]{.underline}, consequentially, [increased the
**uncertainty** about the **relations** between democratic and
non-democratic states]{.underline}. In order words, [thinking in terms
of a zone of democratic pea]{.underline}ce also [created a vision of a
**'zone of turmoil'**]{.underline} (Singer and Wildavsky 1993), a zone
of non-democratic relations. [A new inside/outside was **established**
and resulted in **border cases**]{.underline} --- [such as
**democratizing** or not-yet democratizing states]{.underline}.
[Creating this **uncertainty** or new insecurity presented a key to
translating **non-democracy** into a **threat** and to **securitizing**
democracy.]{.underline}

US foreign policy and the democratic peace: a new guiding principle

While democracy will not soon take hold everywhere, it is in our
interest to do all we can to enlarge the community of free and open
societies, especially in areas of greatest strategic interest (White
House 1996, emphasis added).

In the scientific fact-manufacturing process, politicians were mobilized
as resources in two ways: firstly, as supporters of the production
process, and secondly, as object of study in their role as state
representatives. Researchers managed to interest politicians in
obtaining certainty about the democratic peace, and politicians
therefore shared the interest of stabilizing democratic peace as a fact.
Politicians, however, also mobilized the researchers and their fact as a
resource.

In the US foreign policy discourse, the academically formulated
democratic peace left its first marks in the late 1980s. By 1991,
mentioning it was already conceived of as a 'currently fashionable
notion' among 'policymakers and commentators' (Rothstein 1991: 45, 43).
During the election campaign in 1992, would-be president Clinton was
advised to declare democracy promotion a top priority due to the
scientifically certified relation between democracy and peace (Hamilton
1992; Scholarz 1992), and when he became president he made it a key
principle of his administration\'s foreign policy. The fact found its
way into all major national security policy documents of the 1990s and
turned into 'the essence of the national security rationale' (Talbott
1996: 49). It became so deeply rooted in the American political
landscape that by 1997 even some of the former supporters criticized the
strong reliance on the thesis (e.g. Carothers 1997). The mentioning of
democratic peace has since remained a stable pattern of US foreign
policy --- also, and even stronger in the George W. Bush administration.
As John M. Owen (2005: 1) observed 'the Bush administration has gone
much further in its faith in the idea, betting the farm that the theory
holds and will help Washington to achieve a peaceful, stable, and
prosperous Muslim world.'

Why was the democratic peace thesis interesting for the politician? As
already argued, both researchers and politicians shared the prime
concern of finding certainty about the relations between states in a
time where the guiding representations of the Cold War lost credibility.
The well-documented thesis had the capacity to replace the Cold War
representations. [Through]{.underline} the [coupling of military and
scientific resources under]{.underline} the headline of **[democratic
peace]{.underline}**, [the US could **redraw** its map of **global
security**]{.underline}. Direct expressions of it permeate the official
statements of the Clinton administration. For example, Anthony Lake
explained his strategy of 'Engagement and Enlargement':

During the Cold War, even children understood America\'s security
mission; as they looked at those maps on their schoolroom walls, they
knew we were trying to contain the creeping expansion of that big, red
blob. Today \[...\] we might visualize our security mission as promoting
the enlargement of the 'blue areas' of market democracies (Lake 1993).

While the overarching (Cold War) image of a world of two separate
spheres remained, the [emphasis shifted from the]{.underline}
(defensive) [notion of **containment**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the
(active) [one of **enlargement**]{.underline}. As Joseph Kruzel (1994:
180) coined it, [democratic peace laid the ground for a **proactive
policy formulation**]{.underline}, as this had 'a clear policy
implication for the Defense Department: [You can prepare to **defend**
against a threat, or you can make the threat **go away** by **turning**
a country into a democracy]{.underline}.' The national security
strategies published in the Clinton era confirmed that view. In the 1995
national security report, it was argued that:

Promoting democracy does more than foster our ideals. It advances our
interests because we know that the larger the pool of democracies, the
better off we, and the entire community of nations, will be. Democracies
create free markets that offer economic opportunity, make for more
reliable trading partners and are far less likely to wage war on one
another (White House 1995, our emphasis).

[The **scientific fact** of democratic peace presented the opportunity
'to **unify** American foreign policy]{.underline} around a single
sweeping idea' (Carothers 1997: 99). [The wide acceptance of democratic
peace as a **secured fact**]{.underline} ('we know') and the
depolitization supported by the researchers [opened the possibility to
argue for a convergence of interests and ideals]{.underline} based on
certain knowledge. As Haas (2003) puts this, '[democracy **promotion
efforts** are based on the most hard-headed of
**calculations**]{.underline}: the realization that democracies rarely
go to war against one another, but rather settle their differences
peaceably.' [By presenting the new strategy as]{.underline} a
**[rational]{.underline}** one, th[e strategy was no longer a question
of political choice, but of **necessity**.]{.underline} Instead of being
a normative choice, [democracy promotion was
**depoliticized**]{.underline}. The US Department of State (1999)
reasoned for its democratization practices, by arguing: 'We do so not
just because it is right, but because it is necessary. Our own security
as a nation depends upon the expansion of democracy worldwide.'
Scientific resources were central in this process. And the
administration even directly quoted scholarship. For instance, Strobe
Talbott (1996: 49, footnote 2) refers in his defence of the Haiti
mission to 'a substantial body of empirical evidence and political
science scholarship.'

In sum, [when the democratic peace thesis **entered** the **political
landscape**]{.underline} in the US, [it was translated into **concrete
policy strategies**]{.underline}. It [allowed for]{.underline} clearly
[**distinguishing** friend from foe.]{.underline} It served as a basis
to argue that foreign policy is based on rationality, on 'hard-headed
calculations', and is thus a depoliticized practice. [It was
**translated** into military on-the-ground practices of
**peace-keeping** and peace enforcement and was further **rationalized**
and **securitized**]{.underline}. The objectified link between democracy
and peace had been changed towards a link between democracy and
security. Practices of [democracy promotion moved from an **ideal task**
to an issue of **supreme priority**, were dramatized and finally
**legitimized** the use of **military forces**.]{.underline}Footnote16

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS END\>\>\>

NATO\'s new strategy: the transnational institutionalization of the
democratic peace The democratic peace thesis had thus gone from a
scientific proposition linking democracy and peace, through a national
adaptation in the United States, which turned the focus towards the
concept of security. In NATO, this development was paralleled and came
to institutionalize the shift from peace to security in three ways.
First, new linguistic strategies for the alliance focused on the link
between democracy and security and gave NATO a new direction. Second,
democratic states of the former Eastern block were invited to take part
in everyday life at the alliance HQ in Brussels as 'Partners for Peace'
and in peacekeeping exercises in the region. Through this, NATO created
a practical underpinning to the link between democracy and security.
Third, concrete military operations in the Balkan area were carried out
with reference to the link and tied the military and institutional
resources of the alliance closely to the discursive and practical
institutionalization. Democracy promotion became a transatlantic
security strategy underpinned by practices using institutional,
military, social and political resources. Democracy as the most viable
way to create security and stability for NATO was gradually introduced
in the 1990s (Adler and Barnett 1998; Williams and Neumann 2000). During
the Cold War, NATO had embodied the concept of strategic balancing and
was in need of a new direction after the demise of the Soviet Union and
hence the disappearance of the balancing 'other'. For a short while in
1995, then NATO secretary-general Willy Claes pointed to Islamic
fundamentalism as a possible new threat to replace the communist enemy
as the new balancing other (Bilski 1995); however, this was rejected by
the NATO community. Little by little and in the face of the atrocities
taking place in the Balkan area, NATO came to see itself as the defender
of not only democracy, but of a standard of civilization (Huysmans
2002b; Rasmussen 2003). The link between peace and democracy was stated
as a fundamental value in NATO from the beginning of the 1990s: '...
peace through democracy \[is a\] shared value \[...\] fundamental to the
Partnership' (Partnership for Peace: Framework Document 1994: 1). But as
early as the Turnberry Communiqué (1990: para 1), the link between
democracy, peace and security was present. A process of 'becoming
democratic' was seen as '. an important element in the future security
and stability in Europe' (NAC, Turnberry 1990: para 9) and in the London
declaration the same year, the Alliance vowed to 'support\[...\]
security and stability with the strength of our shared faith in
democracy.' (NAC London 1990: para 2). Security was seen as linked to
NATO\'s neighbours (NAC London 1990: para 4) and the possibility for
enhancing security thus lay in relations with and the nature of these.
Promoting democracy in NATO\'s neighbouring states thus came to be
discursively tied to security, stability and peace. In 1998, the link
was no longer formulated as a value, but took on a more solid character
as a fact of the nature of democracy: 'Military forces which are
accountable to a democratic civilian government are much less likely to
be used for purposes that run counter to peace and stability'
(Partnership for Peace: A Political View 1998: 2, emphasis added). The
fundamental value --- and later fact --- of linking peace, security and
democracy was further translated into practical cooperation in the
military alliance. First, through the creation of the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council (NACC) in 1991 and later through 'the quantum leap'
(NATO 2002: 3), which the creation of the Partnership for Peace (PfP)
constituted for the Alliance. This cooperation was outlined in practice:
The North Atlantic Council (NAC) planned '... to offer permanent
facilities at NATO Headquarters for personnel from NACC countries and
other Partnership for Peace participants in order to improve our working
relationships and facilitate closer cooperation' and to '... propose,
within the Partnership framework, peacekeeping field exercises beginning
in 1994' (Partnership for Peace: Invitation 1994: 2). In 1997, the PfP
Programme was extended to include Russia in a Euro Atlantic Partnership
Council (EAPC), and NATO declared: 'No European democratic country whose
admission would fulfil the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded
from consideration' (Madrid Declaration 1997: para. 8). The Alliance
wanted to build a cooperative security landscape (NAC, Brussels 1996),
inhabited by a certain type of actor --- as the title of the Partnership
for Peace-programme had already foretold. The discursively formulated
link between peace, democracy and security was, thereby, brought into
the transnational realm and was institutionalized through a variety of
practical measures, including new consultation mechanisms, military
diplomacy and joint peacekeeping exercises under the PfP. A complex web
of relations and practices all directed at carrying out the promise of
the link between security and democracy were set up: the military and
institutional resources of the complex organization were used to lift
democracy up as a new security strategy for NATO and the social
resources (networks) were used to spread and consolidate the message of
a democratic peace. In the process, NATO also used the political
resource of 'having won the cold war' to tie the Eastern European
countries close to it. Partners in Peace were a type of actor --- a
border case --- possibly considered eligible to join the democracies
that had 'won' the Cold War. But NATO held the political resources that
allowed it to define who was in and who was out. The overall discursive
and the practical, everyday activities of consultation between former
enemies, sharing offices, meeting each other in the hallways of the NATO
HQ and in the newly established meeting configurations to build security
through democracy were not the only practices to bind security and
democracy together in NATO. When NATO went into military action in the
Balkan area, the link between security and democracy became tied to the
whole military apparatus of NATO and further accentuated the
securitization of democracy. NATO capabilities and command structures
became operational in the service of democracy promotion. Military
resources were primarily mobilized symbolically in the first half of the
1990s ('we won the cold war'), but the new missions from the mid-1990s
onwards put them into practical use. The decisions to intervene in the
Bosnian war in 1994/1995 and later the Kosovo Crisis in early 1999 made
this clear. NATO was ready to apply what the Copenhagen School of
Security Studies would call emergency actions in the quest for civilized
behaviour in the periphery of the cooperative security landscape of
democracies. The Strategic Concept of 1999 was approved by the North
Atlantic Council (NAC) while NATO fighter planes were still bombing
Serbia to reach withdrawal from the Kosovo region. This must have made
the words of the Strategic Concept ring apocalyptically in some
democratic peace theorists' ears. The Alliance vowed 'to preserve peace,
support and promote democracy' (Strategic Concept 1999: para 33) and to
'provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable ... security
environment, based on the growth of democratic institutions' (ibid.:
para 10). The 'promotion' of democracy within NATO in the 1990s can,
thus, be understood along a continuum of practices ranging from general
political statements about the security value of democracy, to concrete
practices in the NATO HQ and securitized practices of military missions.
The entire range of resources: military, institutional and political
were used in support of these practices. The changes in NATO\'s
narrative were profound. Not only had NATO securitized democracy, but
the alliance also reshaped its understanding of space on the basis of
this: NATO was not fighting Serbia per se but the lack of democracy in
the country. Williams and Neumann (2000) argue that: '\[...\] it is the
absence of specific, democratic cultural and political institutions that
comes to define the perception of security' (Williams and Neumann 2000:
369--70; also Rasmussen 2003). NATO was practicing Democratic Peace.

[Democratic peace, **theory**, practice and
**securitization**]{.underline}

The creation of a 'fact' by peace researchers played an important role
in establishing a web of democratic peace practice. Our explorative
analysis showed that all three agencies analysed above contributed to
stabilizing this fact through multiple, specific practices and
resources. All three groups formed part of the web and depended on each
other; none were detached from the production in the practice field:
peace researchers added authority and certainty to the Kantian utopia by
depoliticizing and transforming it into a simple statement by using
techniques such as statistics. US foreign policymakers relied on the
fact to unify US foreign policy under one certain principle in a world
where old certainties were lost: [non-democracy was securitized, became
a **threat**]{.underline}. [The securitization of democracy opened a
path for applying **military emergency measures**]{.underline} --- [a
trend that became **institutionalized** in **NATO**
strategy]{.underline}. The agencies, thus, 'hang together' in the web of
practice: without scientific authorization, the fact could not work as
an integrated, depoliticized security technique. Without strong
political and bureaucratic reliance on the fact, research on democratic
peace risked marginalization --- and perhaps loss of funding. Attention
towards the specificities of scientific practice and towards
non-linguistic practices brought this to the fore.

Therefore, a story of the democratic peace thesis as a success story of
knowledge transfer is clearly challenged by our discussion. No simple
one-way diffusion of knowledge was taking place. Instead, [the effect of
the web of **democratic peace** practice was the **establishment** of
non-democracy as a security threat and the transformation of **democracy
promotion** into a **security technology**]{.underline}, governed by
necessities.

If such a diagnosis is adequate, the issue of researchers'
responsibility and the dilemma created in this web need to be raised.
Certainly individual democratic peace researchers did not intend to
securitize democracy, create new threats --- rather the
opposite.Footnote17 Through practice, they contributed to this process.
Consequently, from the researchers' perspective, [the case of democratic
peace must be seen as one example of how the normative dilemma of
writing security plays itself out in practice]{.underline}. The fact
underwent such important translations through [social practices that the
vision of a **peaceful universe** of democracies]{.underline} was not
only **[translated]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} political and
strategic documents, but into real, [**military war-fighting** and
on-the-ground practices.]{.underline} Yes, peace research had proven
relevant --- but in a way that foregrounds the unintended consequences
of weaving a web of practice. In the web, research lent scientific and
social authority to the link between peace and democracy, and ended up
being taken as authority over the link between peace and security by
practitioners.

The normative dilemma of writing security takes a spin when tied to a
network of practices instead of to the subject of security or the
utterance of the word security. It is equally tied to peace, and may be
located in very different cases. Therefore, the dilemma should be
studied concretely and not be left as an epistemological deadweight for
researchers. The dilemma can be situated in time and space, and can be
connected to concrete actors in a field of practice.

Conclusions: Towards Reflexive Scholarship in the Field of Security

This article set out to strengthen our understanding of the relationship
between theory and practice in world politics. We argued that two ways
of approaching this relationship are prevalent in IR: an account that
cultivates an imaginary of a gap between theory and practice, and a
poststructuralist-informed account, which we called 'one big text'. We
sketched idealized versions of the two imaginaries, discussed their
merits and shortcomings and concluded that they do not provide us with
the tools to understand the practical interaction between IR theory and
world politics. [The poststructuralist imaginary highlighted the
possibility of self-fulfilling prophecies and a normative dilemma of
writing security, but told us **little** about how these processes work
in **practice**.]{.underline}

In order [to]{.underline} explore how theories and practices are
connected, we argued for starting from an alternative imaginary of the
relation. To help facilitate this, we adopted a practice theory
approach. Using notions from practice theory, we suggested understanding
science (IR) and politics as social practices in loosely structured webs
of practice. Seen from this perspective, the [discourses,
representations and practical activities of social scientists form part
of the social world and as such take part in the struggle to **define
reality**]{.underline}. Social science practices, however, are not just
one text alongside others, as suggested by the poststructuralist
imaginary: attention towards the specific objectifying and homogenizing
practices of research is necessary.

[To give **empirical flesh** to the theoretical discussions and to
demonstrate the difference a practice theory approach makes, we
discussed the example of the **democratic peace thesis**]{.underline}.
We sought to raise the possibility that ['ivory tower scientists', US
foreign policymakers and NATO politicians and bureaucrats hang together
in a web and use each other as a **resource**]{.underline}. Our claim
was that the certainty that researchers gave to a philosophical thought
of democratic peace helped weave the web tighter. [Scientific authority
became an essential resource in establishing the democratic peace as a
**strong principle** of contemporary **security politics**]{.underline}.
Peace researchers' translation and depolitization of Kant\'s utopia
opened the floor for securitizing democracy, but they did not govern it.
Their creation of the binaries of democracy/peace and non-democracy/war
contributed to constructing non-democracy as a threat, but did not
dictate it. In the end, [democratization became a security issue,
increasing the likelihood of the **application** of **emergency
measures**.]{.underline}

The case of democratic peace stresses a process similar to the normative
dilemma of writing security. In the described situation, however, the
logic seems to be more subtle or hidden. Peace researchers did not
establish a direct link between security and non-democracy, nor did they
explicitly utter the signifier 'security'. Rather, [the democracy--peace
**link**]{.underline}, established and produced with the intention of
offering a road to peace, [held the potential of being turned **upside
down**]{.underline}. With hindsight and after the [widespread
**legitimation** of **military action** on the grounds of the
**'democratic peace fact'** this hidden dilemma is becoming
**increasingly clear**: the US-led Iraq war and other contemporary
**military peace operations** testify to a dilemma of **vast
proportions**]{.underline}.

[The end of the Cold War created a demand for **\'new
thinking\'**]{.underline} that influenced the Clinton administration
(Jentleson, 2000). [Democracy promotion, boosted by **intellectual
support** from **DPT**]{.underline}, [became the **preferred
orientation**]{.underline} of the Clinton administration, [although in a
**securitised form**]{.underline}. The role of Doyle, the Belfer Center
and International Security, as well as Larry Diamond and the PPI, were
of central importance during the 1990s in securing the place of DPT in
foreign policy discourse and action. This is further seen by the
temporary withdrawal from overly optimistic versions of DPT in the
second Clinton administration with the inauguration of \'democratic
engagement\', prompted by the work of Mansfield and Snyder. However,
this merely endorsed a more aggressive democracy-consolidation
programme, as suggested by Mansfield and Snyder whose research findings
--- published for the Belfer Center by MIT Press - indicated that the
conditions for successful democratisation included US assistance to
build a multiparty system and a vigorous free press, among other things
(Mansfield and Snyder, 2005). Relatedly, [the **expansion** of NATO as a
global alliance of democracies, underpinned by DPT, also shows the
influence of the theory and its **securitisation**]{.underline}.
According to Strobe Talbott, candidates for NATO membership needed to
demonstrate the strength of their democratic institutions\', and
willingness to confront \'new threats\'. The very prospect of NATO
membership would act as a catalyst to democratic reform and economic
liberalisation, and contribute to the peaceful resolution of disputes
and general stability (Talbott, 1995; NATO, 2010).

Further to the political-ideological right, Fukuyama\'s [championing of
DPT set in train a **movement**]{.underline} among neo-conservatives
more militantly and aggressively [to pursue DPT to its\' **logical\'
conclusion**: forcible **regime change**]{.underline}. Interestingly,
groups such as PNAC were actively engaged with Clinton\'s Pentagon by
2000, whereas Fukuyama became prominent in the Princeton Project on
National Security, headed by John Ikenberry and Anne-Marie Slaughter, as
well as Tony Lake and George Shultz (Parmar, 2009).

The evidence shows [the conceptual, symbolic and **instrumental
influence** of **DPT**]{.underline}. Conceptually, from Clinton to the
neo-conservatives, there occurred a change in the purposes and
rhetorical justifications of American power. [America\'s liberal values
and its national security interests were unified by DPT. Symbolically,
DPT **legitimised** American **preponderance** in a world made dangerous
by rogue and terrorist **states**]{.underline}. [**Intervening** against
such regimes further secured America\'s **self-image** as a **good
state**, while maintaining **powerful armed forces** and **increasing
military budgets** at near Cold War levels, and **heading off** demands
for a **\'peace dividend\'.**]{.underline} The instrumental influence of
DPT is seen in the Clinton era and, perhaps most clearly, in the
post-9-11 Bush doctrine and the war on Iraq that followed.

non-violent) [treatment to the external state]{.underline}. [For
**nondemocratic states**]{.underline}, [democratic norms are **not**
applicable]{.underline}. The combination of securitization and identity
leads us to expect an emphasis on the type of regime in the rhetoric
regarding each regime. We do in fact see that is the case with both
India and Iran. [India]{.underline} is [described as a
**democracy**]{.underline} often and usually before any other
characterization. [Arising out of this shared democracy is a sense of
**partnership** and **trust**]{.underline}. That trust endures despite
Indian actions, like the 1998 test, that betrayed US wishes.

As with India, [Iran is often and **primarily characterized** by its
**regime**]{.underline}. Unlike India, [Iran is presented as
**undemocratic**]{.underline}. [Flowing from this characterization is
the US perception that Iranian nuclear weapons pose a threat to
**itself** and the larger free world]{.underline}. [The US-Iranian
relationship is one of **mistrust**]{.underline}. [It is
**telling**]{.underline} that [the solution proposed]{.underline} by the
United States [for resolving the threat posed by Iran\'s nuclear program
is for Iran to **democratize**]{.underline}. The evidence here indicates
that [**democratic identity** does **structure** how policy leaders
communicate security threats to the public]{.underline}. Given the
constraints democratic structure places on the security policy of
democracies, [**identity** seems to have a real and significant impact
on the decisions of war and peace that lie behind the **democratic
peace**]{.underline}. Figures 2 and 3 sum up my mechanistic argument

What would US foreign policy have looked like without DPT? Certainly,
neo-Wilsonianism would still have been available to Clintonites, and
therefore democracy promotion. However, in an uncertain post-Cold War
world, the social scientific \'certainties\' promised by DPT with all
the hallmarks of scholarly legitimacy, relative simplicity of its
underlying thesis and the marketability of spreading/defending
democracy, and thereby dealing with the \'Vietnam syndrome\' - proved
decisive. [The fact that there was support for DPT from across the

**[Without DPT]{.underline}** - which could operate either unilaterally

### Fish Link

#### Fish securitization [collapses]{.underline} sustainable fisheries governance. Desecuritization [solves]{.underline}.

[Sustainable fisheries governance is the sum of the legal, social,
economic, and political **arrangements**]{.underline} used to achieve
the goal of sustainable fisheries---involving habitat, ecosystems, etc.
\[7\]---relating to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by
the United Nations (UN) \[8\]. [Sustainable fishing guarantees the
**preservation** of fisheries resources and the fish habitats in the
**future**]{.underline} \[9\]. However, different from sustainable
governance in other fields, [one of the characteristics of **marine
fish**]{.underline} [is that their movement is not restricted by
**artificially divided** ocean areas]{.underline}, as is the case with
migratory fish and transboundary fish \[10\]. Furthermore, [**any
change** in the ocean can cause a **chain reaction**]{.underline}: [the
**extinction** of one fish stock or a change in the **environment** of a
sea area may affect the **sustainability** of **other** fish
stocks]{.underline} or the environment of other sea areas; moreover,
global issues such as climate change also have an impact on the maritime
environment and the sustainability of fish stocks \[11\]. In other
words, [fish are **uncontrollable**, and ocean spaces **cannot** be
**separated**]{.underline}. [However, ocean governance under the law of
the sea is based on the **legal division** of the
**ocean**]{.underline}. According to UNCLOS, maritime areas are divided
into five main zones---internal waters, territorial sea, the contiguous
zone, exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and the high seas \[2\]. States
have different powers and duties in different areas \[2\]. [The
difference between **artificially divided** oceans and **natural**
oceans]{.underline} \[1\] implies [that ocean governance, especially
marine fisheries governance, requires **cooperation**]{.underline} among
states [because ocean governance is **impossible** to achieve by those
measures that states take **within** their jurisdiction]{.underline}
\[12\]---states' domestic laws can hardly be applied on the high seas.
Therefore, in this field, sovereign states play the most critical role,
which practice and achieve sustainable fisheries governance by
developing fisheries legislation and policies to influence and regulate
the behavior of other actors in fisheries, and [international
cooperation is **necessary**]{.underline}. The international legal
framework for sustainable fisheries governance is constructed by setting
forth rights and obligations for all states, through which the law of
the sea provides a legal basis for cooperation among states in
sustainable fisheries governance.

The law of the sea also limits, to some extent, the cooperation of
states in sustainable fisheries governance. Under the influence of the
freedom of fishing on the high seas \[2\], flag state jurisdiction
\[2\], the principle of privity of treaty \[13\] as well as the rule of
international law which proclaims that any state other than the flag
state has no jurisdiction over foreign vessels on the high seas
(established by the Bering Sea (Fur Seals) Arbitration \[14\]),
sustainable fisheries governance, especially on the high seas, rely
heavily on the willingness of states. The freedom of fishing on the high
seas is still widely accepted and enforced, although it is gradually
beginning to be restricted \[15\]; flag state jurisdiction and the rule
of international law that vessels on the high seas have immunity from
the jurisdiction of any states other than the flag state lead to a
situation where, in the oceans where coastal states have no
jurisdiction, only the flag state has jurisdiction over its vessels. In
sustainable fisheries governance, it implies that on the high seas or in
disputed waters, coastal states or flag states may refuse to regulate
and punish those vessels breaking the rules of sustainable fisheries
governance to practice their national security strategies. Moreover, the
flags of convivence vessels, which is a common phenomenon, further
produces difficulties for sustainable fisheries governance \[16\]. The
flag that is flown by a convenience vessel is not the flag of the
country of ownership, which results in the country of ownership having
no jurisdiction over the vessel and the flag state being unwilling to
regulate and punish the vessel.

Generally, the consideration of states' security plays an essential role
in states' willingness and security strategies. [When an issue is
constructed as a **security issue**]{.underline}, namely, [the issue is
**securitized**]{.underline} \[17\], and [its political sensitivity
**rapidly increases**]{.underline}. In other words, the securitization
of one issue will lead to a greater tendency of states to confront
rather than cooperate on this issue and other sub-issues associated with
it \[18\]. [The **securitization** of **maritime commons** and its
impact are gaining increasing **discussion**]{.underline} in the
maritime field \[19\], [which can lead to the **maritime commons** and
those issues occurring within it becoming **security
issues**]{.underline}. [Securitization]{.underline} can also [reduce a
state's **willingness** to cooperate]{.underline} \[20\]. [However,
sustainable fisheries management]{.underline} and governance [need
**international cooperation**]{.underline}, which [relies on the
willingness of **all**]{.underline} states. Therefore, it is necessary
to find solutions based on international law, which is an effective
basis for cooperation.

From the perspective of international law and securitizations theory,
this article focuses on the conflicts and [**challenges** faced by
international cooperation in sustainable **fisheries** governance due to
the **securitizations** of **maritime commons**]{.underline}. This
article first analyses securitization theory and discusses the
international legal framework for sustainable fisheries governance,
which is a legal basis for international cooperation in this field. This
article finds that [the **securitization** of the maritime commons has
**damaged** the international legal framework for **sustainable
fisheries governance**, leading to the **destruction** of]{.underline}
the foundation of [international cooperation and the **securitization**
of sub-issues in this field]{.underline}. Illegal, unreported, and
unregulated ([IUU]{.underline}) [fishing has become a
sub-issue]{.underline} that is heavily affected by the securitization of
the maritime commons \[21\]. Therefore, after analyzing the
international legal framework for addressing IUU fishing, the second
part of this article chooses evidence from the Northeast Asia Pacific
and the South China Sea to demonstrate that [the **securitization** of
the **maritime commons** has **undermined** international cooperation to
combat IUU fishing by **damaging** the legal basis of international
cooperation and **securitizing IUU fishing**]{.underline}. This
epitomizes the [**detriment** of the securitization of the maritime
commons to **international cooperation** on sustainable fisheries
**governance**]{.underline}. Subsequently, [desecuritization
is]{.underline} considered [the **core** of the **solution** to the
**negative consequences** produced by the **securitization** of the
maritime commons]{.underline}. [By **desecuritization**, security issues
and non-security **issues** in the maritime commons can be distinguished
and addressed **separately**]{.underline}. The political sensitivity of
sustainable fisheries governance, incorporated into non-security issues,
is reduced, which can effectively promote cooperation among states in
this field. A formal conclusion follows the discussion of the role that
[international law and regional cooperation]{.underline} mechanisms [can
play in desecuritization and **sustainable fisheries
governance**.]{.underline}

2.3. [The **Impact** of the **Securitization**]{.underline} [of the
**Maritime Commons**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the [International
**Cooperation** in Sustainable Fisheries **Governance**]{.underline}

The characteristics of the international legal framework for sustainable
fisheries governance implies that in this field, [states' willingness
has a **decisive influence** on whether international cooperation can
**occur**]{.underline}. The [**securitization** of the maritime commons
changes the **priorities**]{.underline} of countries' maritime
activities [and **reduces** states' **willingness** to
**cooperate**]{.underline}, [which can damage **international
cooperation**]{.underline} [in sustainable fisheries
**governance**]{.underline}. The securitization as a result of climate
change and its subsequent practices have proved, that [while
securitization **focuses** the **attention** of states on a particular
area, it also has an obvious **negative impact** on **governance** and
international **cooperation** in this field]{.underline} \[36\]. In
sustainable fisheries governance, the rules can also be applied. The
securitization of the maritime commons has increased states' attention
to the maritime commons and various sub-issues occurring within them.
[It]{.underline} has also [made it easier for states to **prioritize**
national **security** when making decisions.]{.underline} Hence, [states
will be more **inclined** to **confront rather than cooperate** in
maritime commons to **safeguard** their security]{.underline} interests
\[18\]. In addition, [the securitization of the maritime commons
promotes the **securitization** of **fisheries**]{.underline}. Fisheries
issues are a sub-issue within the maritime commons and are generally
considered low-political issues. Hence, [states **tend** to cooperate on
**these issues** to enhance **strategic** trust]{.underline}, which is
the basis for countries to cooperate on high political issues \[50\].
**[However]{.underline}**, the [securitization of the maritime commons
has interfered with this route, leading to issues
associated]{.underline} more [**easily** with those that
are]{.underline} highly [political, and resulting in these]{.underline}
issues [being **securitized**]{.underline}. The [securitized fisheries
issue in the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline} region
[provides]{.underline} valid [evidence of this]{.underline}
\[42,45,50,60\].

From an international law perspective, in sustainable fisheries
governance, [another **impact** is the **lack** of practice experience
due to the reduction in states' **willingness** to
cooperate]{.underline}, resulting in the absence of international legal
instruments, an incomplete international legal framework, as well as
difficulty establishing RFMOs and international sustainable fisheries
governance mechanisms. The two important reasons for the above
consequences are the inefficiency of enforcement mechanisms in the
international legal framework and the fact that the framework focuses
too much on states and ignores other actors in this field, for example,
most international legal instruments lack focus on RFMOs. It also
implies that [it is possible to **reduce** the **damage** caused by the
**securitization** of the maritime commons to sustainable fisheries
governance by improving]{.underline} the **[international legal
framework]{.underline}** for sustainable fisheries governance. In other
issues of the maritime commons, there are already examples of reducing
the negative impact of the securitization of the maritime commons by
enhancing the effectiveness of international legal documents and
increasing their attention to other actors in the international
community, such as the cooperation mechanism to combat piracy in the
Gulf of Aden \[47\], the EU cooperation mechanism to combat IUU fishing
\[61\], etc. To find suitable solutions to improve the international
legal framework, it is also necessary to examine cases from a specific
field of sustainable fisheries governance.

#### Fisheries securitization [escalates]{.underline} maritime disputes and [wrecks]{.underline} international maritime cooperation.

[The **negative impact** of the **securitization**]{.underline} of the
Pacific [is achieved by **affecting** the **willingness** of states to
take measures and cooperate in **combating** IUU fishing]{.underline}.
As evidenced by the Northeast Asia Pacific and the South China Sea,
[states are **more inclined** to view IUU fishing as a **tool** to
achieve national **maritime security strategies** rather than a
**problem** that needs to be solved **cooperatively** under the
influence of]{.underline} the **[securitization]{.underline}** of the
maritime commons \[96\]. The evidence from the South China Sea supports
that the securitization of the region and the resulting [securitization
of IUU fishing]{.underline} in this water [has led states to pay more
attention to **maritime disputes** rather than **maritime
cooperation**]{.underline}, [and to the reduction in trust and
cooperation on combating **IUU fishing**]{.underline}, [although IUU
fishing is the **main reason** for the reduction in fishery
resources]{.underline} and the degradation of the environment in these
waters \[90\], [which requires **cooperation** to solve]{.underline}.
This has resulted in the absence of legal instruments and practices of
cooperation in combating IUU fishing. In turn, this absence has hindered
the construction of effective multilateral treaties or cooperation
mechanisms in this region on cooperation in combating IUU fishing,
ultimately making it more difficult for coastal states to cooperate in
this field.

Moreover, the [**securitization** of the Pacific makes it easier
for]{.underline} all [issues in the Pacific to be linked to highly
**political issues**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus, [to be
**securitized**]{.underline}. The [securitization of IUU fishing is one
of the consequences of the **securitization**]{.underline} of the
Pacific \[42\]. In the Pacific, [the direct **motivation** to securitize
IUU fishing is concern about the **decline** of fisheries
resources]{.underline}, with IUU fishing being one of the main reasons
\[3\]. Therefore, [IUU fishing is considered to pose a **threat** to
food and economic security]{.underline}; some states believe that it may
constitute a transnational organized crime and have included it in their
maritime security strategies \[37,105\]. [This brings IUU fishing into
the **scope** of **maritime security**]{.underline} \[40\]. As a result,
[after the maritime commons are **securitized**]{.underline}, [IUU
fishing will be more likely to be **securitized**]{.underline} than
other issues that also occur in the maritime commons. According to the
evidence from the Northeast Asia Pacific and the South China Sea, [the
**negative impact** of the securitization of the maritime commons on
combating IUU fishing is **significant**]{.underline}. For example,
[after the **securitization** of **fisheries** and IUU
fishing]{.underline} in the South China Sea, most [**maritime disputes**
involved **fishing vessels**, which were often **accused** of engaging
in IUU **fishing**]{.underline} \[50\]. [This increase in **disputes**
and **conflict**]{.underline} can [lead to **reduced trust** among
states]{.underline}. One consequence of the reduction is that [it
becomes **difficult** for states]{.underline} in the South China Sea [to
sign cooperation agreements and establish **regional
cooperation**]{.underline} mechanisms for combating IUU fishing. At the
same time, the South China Sea faces a lack of institutions for
cooperation in combating IUU fishing. The [securitization]{.underline}
of the South China Sea will cause this issue to [become a **highly
politicized** issue, and the willingness of states to develop agreements
or establish cooperative mechanisms will likely be **further
reduced**]{.underline}. [These impacts will]{.underline} ultimately [be
reflected in the absence of **bilateral** or multilateral treaties and
the lack of regional **cooperation mechanisms**]{.underline} in the
South China Sea.

#### Desecuritization solves [sustainable fisheries]{.underline}.

4\. [Returning to the **Essence** of Sustainable Fisheries Governance:
**Solutions** to the **Securitization** of the Maritime
Commons]{.underline}

4.1. [The **Core of the Solution**]{.underline}:
**[Desecuritization]{.underline}** [of the **Maritime Commons** and
Sustainable Fisheries **Governance**]{.underline}

Security theory believes that the desecuritization or
[**desecuritization** of some issues in the **maritime commons** can
effectively **solve** problems posed by the **securitization** of the
maritime commons]{.underline} \[106\]. The [methods of
**desecuritization** usually **include**: **not treating** it as a
security emergency, **not creating** security dilemmas and vicious
circles, as well as **returning** the securitized issued to **low
political issues**]{.underline} \[107\]. In the securitization of the
maritime commons, [**desecuritization** includes the desecuritization of
the **maritime co**mmons and the desecuritization of the **sustainable
fisheries governance**]{.underline}. One of the goals of the
securitization of the maritime commons is to protect states' maritime
security. However, the evidence from the Gulf of Aden shows that the
[securitizations of the maritime commons **cannot** ensure maritime
security]{.underline} \[47\]. Conversely, [securitization leads to
**less cooperation**]{.underline} because [it reduces the level of
**trust** among states]{.underline}, [reducing their **ability** to
**respond** to common risks at sea, such as the **reduction** in
fisheries resources, environmental **pollution**, **piracy**,
etc.]{.underline} It also implies that the [desecuritization of the
maritime commons is **necessary**]{.underline}; however, the feasibility
of this is very low. Therefore, in practice, the desecuritization of the
maritime commons faces a dilemma: desecuritization is necessary, while
states usually refuse it. The [Arctic Council is a typical
example]{.underline}. The Arctic Council, whose purpose is not related
to military security, became involved in issues related to military
security, and soft tissues in the Arctic began to be securitized
\[108\], such as the securitization of climate change in the Arctic
\[27\]. Despite facing much criticism, [the Arctic Council and its
member states maintain their focus on military issues. The same thing
also occurs in the maritime commons]{.underline}. [Once]{.underline} the
[securitization of the maritime commons **begins**]{.underline},
[although desecuritization is the **best option**]{.underline} for all
states, [the **prisoner's dilemma**]{.underline} [prompts states choose
to continue to treat]{.underline} the issues of the [maritime commons as
**security issues** and to **reject** desecuritization]{.underline} in
situations when it is impossible for states to decide whether other
states are genuinely fulfilling their commitment to desecuritization
\[102--104\]. The trend towards the securitization of the maritime
commons is set to continue in light of the maritime policies currently
adopted by states. However[, it does not mean that **decoupling**
between sustainable fisheries governance and security issues is also
**infeasible**.]{.underline}

In the context of the continuing trend of securitization of the maritime
commons, [**decoupling** the sustainable fisheries governance from
security issues is **an alternative**]{.underline} solution in order [to
achieve sustainable fisheries governance **cooperation**]{.underline}.
Traditionally, fisheries governance is considered a low-level political
issue compared to the military; states usually build and promote trust
by cooperating on low-level political issues \[50\]. [It is necessary to
return sustainable fisheries governance to a **low political
nature**]{.underline}, [which can promote **trust** and
**cooperation**]{.underline} among states on this issue. [According to
the]{.underline} practice of the **[Arctic Council]{.underline}**
\[108\], [international legal instruments can **achieve** this by
distinguishing sustainable fisheries governance from **security
issues**]{.underline}. In addition, the critical difficulty in achieving
cooperation on sustainable fisheries governance is the regulation of
private actors \[71\]. [This requires cooperative
governance]{.underline}, which also requires states to take domestic and
international measures. International law is an effective approach to
regulate the behaviors of states, achieve international cooperation, and
establish cooperative governance mechanisms. Therefore, the goal can be
achieved by improving the international legal framework for sustainable
fisheries governance and establishing regional cooperative governance
mechanisms.

\*Edited for language

**[Water scarcity]{.underline}** [is a **universal challenge** we are
all facing as humanity-**together**]{.underline}. [Ensuring there is a
**sustainable supply** and **consumption** of this precious resource for
all human beings is **high** on the **priority list** of the global
agenda]{.underline}. Therefore, [the world has to look into a **common
solution** to this **common challenge**]{.underline} and which is in
fact in the bound of our knowledge and ability.
**[However]{.underline}**, in some rare in stances, but with huge
ramifications, [we have observed a **narrow** and **misguided** concept,
**securitization of water**, **hijack** water security.]{.underline}

Securitization of water

**[Securitizing water]{.underline}**, [making water into a **military
commodity**]{.underline} [which should be defended at the **cost** of
**human lives**]{.underline}, [is a **completely different matter** than
**water security**.]{.underline}

"**[Securitization]{.underline}** in international relations [is the
process of state actors transforming subjects into matters of
"security"]{.underline}: an extreme version of politicization that
enables extraordinary means to be used in the name of security. Issues
that become securitized do not necessarily represent issues that are
essential to the objective survival of a state, but rather represent
issues where someone was successful in constructing an issue into an
existential problem." Barry Buzan, Ole Waever, and Jaap de Wilde, (1998)
Security: A New Framework for Analysis (emphasis added)

[When water is **securitized**, the discussion runs **off-course** from
being about **human needs** and **water security**]{.underline}. Rather
[it becomes about constructing a social and political **narrative** to
make water into an **existential problem**.]{.underline} [When water is
**securitized**, it is **dehumanized**, made it into a **military
commodity** that should be claimed, owned and **defended** at **all
cost**.]{.underline} [When water is **securitized**]{.underline} then
[states start thinking of the resource as their **own property** and
**only theirs**]{.underline}; [something which]{.underline} they [must
**defend** at **all cost**]{.underline} [and not a **civil resource**
open for **all**]{.underline}, shared by all [leading to **zero-sum
politics**]{.underline}. [Securitization of water]{.underline} issues
[leaves **no room** for **negotiation** or **compromises** because water
then becomes a matter of **national security** and you do **not**
negotiate or **compromise** on national security.]{.underline}

[When water is **securitized**]{.underline} [statements like **"one drop
of water or our blood"** make **"complete sense"** to those making
them]{.underline}. [When water becomes a **military commodity** which is
**claimed**]{.underline}, [and not a **human resource**]{.underline}
which is [available to all]{.underline}, then [states
become]{.underline} \[~~blind~~\][ignorant to]{.underline} the
[misery]{.underline} of fellow states, [become **oblivious** to scarcity
**devouring** other states- the same scarcity **they** are trying to
**avoid**.]{.underline} [When water is **securitized** it becomes
necessary that the **military** and the intelligence have the **upper
hand** over **water resource professionals**]{.underline}. [When water
is securitized **intellectuals** will not be the **decision makers**,
the **military** will be]{.underline}. [When water is securitized
**war** becomes a reasonable, plausible **option**]{.underline}
alongside science and diplomacy. [When water is securitized the approach
is not **knowledge** and **science-based** solution but a
**Machiavellian way** of **"the end justifies the means"**]{.underline}
resonating with statements like "all options are on the table, we will
defend our interest by all available means, etc." Does this seem like a
paradigm which makes sense in the 21st century?

**[The way out]{.underline}**

[Water is a **human right**, not something the one with a **stronger
military** can claim]{.underline}. [While **securing** water for people
is]{.underline} a [noble and genuine]{.underline} thing to do,
**[securitizing]{.underline}** [water is the most **inhumane thing**
anyone can do]{.underline}. How can you hope to militarily defend your
claim, the same claim you share with your fellow brothers and sisters,
the claim that sustains your life, by taking other lives? How does that
make sense? How is that reasonable? [If scarcity is the issue, it is the
issue for everyone. So how does militarily securing one party's interest
even make the **slightest rational sense**?]{.underline}

[It is]{.underline} \[~~insanity~~\]**[absurdity]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} hope to [protect the **giver** of life, water, by
**taking lives**]{.underline}. It is senseless to think our needs trumps
over others and demands precedence. Fear, negligence, and undeservedly
claimed historical privileges "status quo" might well be the reasons
behind such ideas as securitizing water. These [reasons might be
**understandable** as a result of **years of construction**, but they
most definitely are **not justifiable**.]{.underline}

[Let us make a distinction between **water security** and
**securitizing** water]{.underline}. [They are **not the
same**]{.underline}, [they are **not related**, nor are they
compatible]{.underline}. If what [we want]{.underline} is [to secure
water]{.underline} for our people, [then welcome, we are all in the
**same boat**]{.underline} and I trust that we can and will overcome
this challenge together. [But wanting to **securitize
water**]{.underline}, making it into a political construct, [construing
ones need into a seemingly **existential requirement**]{.underline}
which trumps the needs of others, [so much so that we would go as far as
defending it with **blood**, however, is **unreasonable** and
**unjustifiable**.]{.underline}

So, let us make a distinction; [water security does **not equate** to
securitizing water]{.underline}. If we agree on this, I am sure we can
come up with a common solution to overcome the challenge. After all, to
overcome challenges is the trademark of the human race. [Focusing
on]{.underline} the issue at hand, which is [**water security**, and
capitalizing on the scientific and technological innovations we have is
**instrumental** in solving the challenge the entire world is
**facing**]{.underline}. Genuine political will to come to a mutually
beneficial and [**sustainable use** of the limited resources we have is
**indispensable** in **resolving** the issues of scarcity and
disagreements over water]{.underline}. Given the current state of
affairs in the world, this might feel like a tall order. However, [we do
not have to start from **scratch**, we already have **inspirations** to
look to.]{.underline}

Inspirations

[We can site the lesson from the **Senegal River Basin**]{.underline},
where genuine political will and [**respect** for each other's **needs**
allowed countries to come to an arrangement which the world
applauds]{.underline}. The [Senegal River basin]{.underline} is a
transboundary [river basin]{.underline} in west Africa [shared by 4
riparian countries; Senegal, Guinea, Mali and Mauritania]{.underline}. A
[severe drought]{.underline} between 1968-1973, the great Sahel Drought,
[was a turning point]{.underline} for these countries to take the steps
forward towards a collaborative use of the river basin. They established
the Senegal River Basin Development organization (OMVS) as a significant
authority in the basin and commissioned a co-owned multi-purpose dam in
the basin called the Manantali dam, located in Mali and owned by Mali,
Senegal and Mauritania. Like any transboundary riparian states, [these
three west African states had **conflicting interests** in water
use]{.underline}; Mali wanted to use the river for navigation and energy
production while Senegal and Mauritania wanted to use the river for
irrigation and power production. [However, by **capitalizing** on their
shared interests rather than individual demands, these three countries
were able to **reconcile** the needs of **each country**]{.underline}.
[By starting from a **place of understanding** and **cooperation** these
countries were able to reach at a **symbiotic** and **amicable
arrangement**]{.underline}, an exemplary practice of transboundary water
governance throughout the world.

We can also look to [Israel]{.underline} to see how [a traditionally
water scarce, drought prone, **desert country**]{.underline} managed to
[transform itself into a **water surplus nation**]{.underline}, a desert
oasis while its rainfall decreased by half since 1948 due to climate
change while its population increased ten-fold. [Relying on
**"home-grown"** technologies such as increasingly energy efficient
**desalination** and drip **irrigation** added to smart water
agriculture, efficient water use and reuse in domestic and industrial
sectors, judicious use of ground-water resources and **water
conservation** has turned Israel into a **water surplus
country.**]{.underline}

There a [lot more examples of transboundary **water
cooperation**]{.underline} throughout the world [such as another
**co-owned dam** between Brazil and Paraguay]{.underline} in South
America, [the Indus **water treaty** between India and Pakistan which
survived two]{.underline} severe **[wars]{.underline}** between these
countries as well as the [**practices** from the Mekong river basin and
Aral sea basin in **central Asia**]{.underline} where basin states
engaged in regional energy and virtual water trade as possible
mechanisms of transboundary water management.

The [Nile basin]{.underline}, sadly, [is an excellent example of how
wrong things can go when]{.underline} the [distinction between water
security and securitization is **blurred**]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} insistence to keep extremely skewed historical
injustices in the name of national security is utterly indefensible when
[the whole basin is expected to be one of the most **water scarce**
areas]{.underline} in the near future. Clinging to outdated and biased
nations while the rest of the world is moving in the direction of
equitable and reasonable use is like sailing against the wind. Article 2
of The Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) defines water security as
the right of all Nile Basin States to reliable access to and use of the
Nile River system for health, agriculture, livelihoods, production and
environment. All the basin states have agreed on this article, so now it
is time to put our money where our mouth is.

Water security is and will continue to be a pressing issue in the Nile
Basin and we need to collectively move forward in solving this
challenge. But for that to happen [egocentric policies such as
securitizing water need to be **eliminated** first.]{.underline} There
is a lot we can learn from practices across the world, including the
good practices mentioned above on how to jointly move towards water
security in the Nile basin. [It is necessary that we **revolutionize**
our way of thinking, utilization and management of water]{.underline}.
[No]{.underline} amount of conversation is going to [move]{.underline}
us [forward on the issue of **water security** if we are stuck on the
notion of **securitizing water**]{.underline}. [It is time to let go of
self-centred notions implying **"my needs trumps yours"** and embrace
the **common challenge** and **work together** for the good of the human
race.]{.underline}

2.3 [**Water securitisation** and **Crisis Escalation**]{.underline}

Marielena Octavio (2018) asks 'how a [rhetorical and linguistic
**discourse**]{.underline} be used to [**justify** securitisation
practices]{.underline} and [the **impact** on **decision
making**']{.underline} and by extension its [application in case of
**water conflicts**]{.underline}. [Due to a **lack** of adequate
academic **exploration**]{.underline}, the [issue of **water security**
is significantly linked to water allocation and **scarcity** rather than
crises that **result** from **politicised responses**]{.underline}
(ibid). These [securitised responses **overlook** engagement with actors
who **'do'** and are **impacted** by this securitisation.]{.underline}
The concern on water security, to be non-politicised, would entail the
state not dealing with it and not making it a concern of public debate.
[Having been **securitised**]{.underline} in many 'locations', as Waever
visualised, **[water scarcity]{.underline}** [has been translated into
an immediate **existential threat**]{.underline}. While this may be
accurate or desirable from an environmental perspective, in terms of
security responses, [it configures a **spin-off** for
crises.]{.underline}

Conventional conflict studies address crisis escalation with an
appraisal of negotiation and bargaining processes between the actors.
[With]{.underline} cost assessment and [failure of bargaining, a
traditional interstate conflict would escalate to **violence** and
**military engagement**.]{.underline} Furthermore, in analysing crisis
escalation over natural resources, Lisa J. Carlson (1995) incorporates
actor perception; the parties involved in negotiation are often focused
on different aspects of the issue and relative assessment of strengths.
A [lack of shared ideological spaces leads to a **failure** of
bargaining power]{.underline}. **[Therefore]{.underline}**, [resource
management]{.underline}, if not the direct source of conflict, [is the
**threat multiplier** and exacerbates the **vulnerabilities** of the
parties involved]{.underline} (UN Peacekeeping, no date). [As the issue
is]{.underline} successfully [**securitised**, the **measures** for
**preventing** the threat are also legitimised **erupting violence** as
a result.]{.underline}

16.4 [**Security**, Control and **Pacification**]{.underline}

Arguably [it is **advisable** to exercise **restraint** in the
application of the words **'security'** and **'insecurity'** to
situations involving **food**]{.underline}. This has less to do with
differences in the ways that 'food security' and 'food insecurity' have
been defined and employed to describe both
individual/household/micro-level and macro-level phenomena than to the
[enlargement of the concept of 'security'.]{.underline} As Warner (2013:
78--79) observes, [the fall of the Berlin Wall was accompanied by 'a
widening of the security domain beyond its traditional concern with
territory]{.underline}. Fossil fuels, oil, drugs, economic competition,
the environment and terrorism could all be elevated to national security
concerns and, in so doing, [legitimize **special
measures**]{.underline}, such as the [**deployment** of the military and
the **suspension** of civil rights'.]{.underline}

While remaining sensitive to global needs for food and water, and to the
ways in which various phenomena (such as global climate change) may
contribute to conditions of scarcity and suffering, [we]{.underline}
would [argue for **close inspection** of official **claims** about food
insecurity and efforts **undertaken** by states in the name of ensuring
food security to make sure that **ensuing measures** are not **veiled
attempts** at increasing **state power**]{.underline}---[or]{.underline}
at ['mak\[ing\] **bourgeois** all that is **inherently
communal**']{.underline} (Neocleous and Rigakos 2011: 20). [This
**process** has been referred to by critical or anti-security scholars
as **'pacification'**]{.underline}---[a set of **practices** intended to
**establish** a certain social order]{.underline}---'[to
produce]{.underline} undisruptive and unthreatening forms of collective
[action through a **combination** of **coercion** and
consent']{.underline} (Kienscherf 2014: 3; see also Neocleous et al.
2013).

We will return to the concept of 'pacification' at the end of this
section. Before doing so, it is helpful to offer an example of how [the
distribution of food]{.underline} (or the lack thereof) can [serve as an
**exercise** of **state power** and **subordination** of
populations]{.underline}. [This was demonstrated
**extensively**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} earlier [**colonialist**
appropriations of land and **expropriation** of food]{.underline}. As
Mutter and Barnard (2010: 276) remark, 'Historically, it is very
possible that drought-induced food shortages combined with cruel,
bias-based or malfeasant government actions have given rise to famines
that have caused the greatest mortality of all disasters'. As Davis
(2001) shows, however, in his detailed history of famines and droughts
in late-nineteenth-century Brazil, China and India, [there is more to
'drought-induced food shortages' than the **forces** or **failures of
nature**]{.underline}. Davis argues that '[the division of humanity into
**haves** and **have-nots**]{.underline}---[was shaped by **fatal
interactions** between world climate and world economy at the **end** of
the nineteenth century]{.underline}' and that it is possible to identify
'Three waves of drought, famine and disease' that 'devastated
agriculture throughout the tropics and northern China when the monsoons
failed'. Davis estimates that the '[total human toll could not have been
less than 30 million victims]{.underline}. Fifty million dead might not
be unrealistic'. As has occurred in more recent years, the effects of
the El Niño-Southern Oscillation on air mass and Pacific ocean
temperature shaped 'these catastrophic climate disasters and crop
failures', but as Davis remarks, '[nature alone is **rarely** so
deadly']{.underline}.

Millions of cultivators in India and China had been recently
incorporated into webs of world trade as subsistence adversity, caused
by various state and imperial policies, had encouraged them to turn to
cash-crop cultivation. As a result, peasants and farmers became
dramatically more vulnerable after 1850 to natural disasters such as
extreme climate events and were at the same time whiplashed by
long-distance economic perturbations whose origins were as mysterious as
those of the weather (Davis 2002).

With the absence of the expected Monsoon in India in late 1876, a
drought followed that resulted in a famine that led to inequalities in
distribution of available food and water. Subsequently, [the mechanisms
of **management** of the starving and impoverished poor that were
introduced by the **colonial power** involved]{.underline} what would
today be regarded as [**indefensible abuses** of human
rights]{.underline} (Davis 2001: 38--40). As Davis records, in some
parts of India at this time, rice and wheat production had been above
average for the previous three years but with '\[w\]idespread
unemployment and the high price of grain\[,\]... the spectre of hunger'
began to intrude even into districts where rainfall had been adequate.
So [why did local populations starve?]{.underline} Where was the rice
and grain? [The answer]{.underline}, of course, [is that 'much of the
surplus had been exported to England. Londoners were in effect eating
**India's bread'**]{.underline}. As we have noted earlier, this example
illustrates how [food has been a **tool** used at the discretion of
those in charge of the **administration of power**.]{.underline} Their
[**control** of the supply of food has been one way of exercising
**power** over **life and death** and proven a chillingly **effective
means** of pursuing programmes of **pacification** of indigenous
peoples]{.underline} (see Kienscherf 2014: 5; Neocleous 2011a: 198--201,
2013).

16.5 **[Conclusion]{.underline}**

[Neither food scarcity or famine **need** to happen]{.underline}. With
regard to the former, White (2010: 10) observes that '[perceived
**national interests** dictate that \[food\] scarcity is in part
**generated** by efforts to **control** it for some population groups
over and above **use** by others']{.underline}. With regard to the
latter, '[Modern famine scholarship regards]{.underline} famine
mortality [as **entirely preventable**]{.underline} by governments. [If
so]{.underline}, the question is [why in the **20th century alone**
between **70 and 80 million people** may have died in
famines]{.underline} (Devereux 2000, p. 7)' (Plumper and Nuemayer 2009).
[We need]{.underline}, then, ['to understand security not
as]{.underline} some kind of universal of [transcendental value but
rather as a mode of **governing** or a political technology of **liberal
order-building**']{.underline} (Neocleous 2011b: 26).

In sum[, 'security' is]{.underline}, as Light (2014: 1792, 1797) argues,
[a multifaceted rather than **monolithic concept**]{.underline}. While
it may mean many things in many different contexts, i[t can
be]{.underline}---and often is---[a means of
**pacification**]{.underline}. Accordingly, [when we speak of 'food
security']{.underline} \[or any 'security', for that matter, [we must
ask]{.underline} (following Eman et al. 2013: 17 (citing Baldwin 1997)
and Wall 2013: 41 (citing Rigakos 2011)\]:

**[Security for whom?]{.underline}**

Security for which values?

Security against which threats?

[How much security?]{.underline}

**[Security at what costs?]{.underline}**

This article has shown that [food defence **narratives**]{.underline}
and practices introduced [in the USA]{.underline} and increasingly
disseminated in other parts of the world [reflect a successful
**process** of **securitisation** of food supply]{.underline}. Two
important points are worth highlighting about this process. The first is
that there are broader securitising logics that preceded and influenced
the emergence of food defence concept and practices within the food
protection field. These logics are shown not only through the discursive
linkage of the notion of food defence and terrorism (in a moment when
terrorism emerged as a higher and more comprehensive securitisation with
macro-securitisation characteristics in late 1990s and early 2000s), but
also through the [semantic association of the food sector with the label
**'defence'.**]{.underline} [These **securitising
dynamics**]{.underline} brought to the food protection [field a
**militarised logic** associated with the traditional **discourses** of
national security, with its **own vocabulary**, tools and ways of
**coping** with **existential threats**]{.underline}. In the US context,
this process was articulated discursively by several securitising
actors, especially during the Clinton and Bush administrations,
including the executives of the main agencies involved with health and
food (HHS, USDA), homeland security (DHS), defence (DoD) and
intelligence (FBI), and aimed at the food sector, the general population
and the academic community as audiences that accepted the construction
of the food sector as an emergency and priority issue within the
security agenda. At the global level, the main securitising actor was
the World Health Organisation, which constructed in the early 2000s a
discourse addressed to government authorities and the food industry in
which food terrorism was articulated as a threat to populations and the
social, economic and political stability of states. [The notion of
**food defence** emerged closely **linked** to]{.underline} these
[**discursive constructions**.]{.underline}

The second point is that [this **securitisation process**]{.underline}
also [occurs at the micro level of **routine practices**]{.underline},
surveillance, inspections, spatial arrangements, information exchange,
training, and risk management procedures in the food sector. Mainly over
the last decade, [the FDA, USDA, DHS and FBI, together with the **food
industry itself** and the academic field have become **productive** in
the development of standard **protocols** and **routine procedures** of
food security.]{.underline} Taken separately and individually, [these
quasi-automatic **preventive routines**]{.underline} may appear to be
mere standard bureaucratic and technical procedures, but when considered
together and systematically, they [play an **important role** in the
process that keeps the food sector **securitised**.]{.underline}

From this picture, we draw two important conclusions. The first,
specifically [related to the **debate** on food defence]{.underline}, is
that [this concept is not limited to its **technical** and operational
aspects but is anchored in a **strong political** and **security**
dimension]{.underline}. [Unless this dimension is **understood**, it is
not possible to deeply **understand** the role that this concept plays
in the broad field of **food protection**.]{.underline} In a context of
increasing export of this concept to other parts of the world, including
to countries in the so-called Global South, it is important that the
debate on food defence does not lose sight of the fact that, behind its
technical and operational aspects, there is a broad securitization
process closely connected, from its origins, with US security and
defence concerns. Although the implications of this finding for
peripheral countries in the Global South were not the focus of this
article, we think that a more critical perspective is necessary in the
academic debate when considering the applicability of the food defence
concept outside its original political conditions and context.

Limitations notwithstanding, this study is one of the first attempts to
situate a food policy study in the context of securitization as a social
construct -- an area of growing scholarly interest. By doing so, it
shows how [**framing practices** have **constructed** the way in which
governments create **policy** and **mobilize resources** to **solve**
food-related issues]{.underline}. [Understanding how **securitization**
takes place during **food policy creation** is **important** for both
current and future food policy analysis]{.underline}, and this area
would therefore benefit greatly from further in-depth research.

### Prolif Link

#### The hypocrisy embedded in the non-proliferation regime [precludes]{.underline} any possibility of [actual disarmament]{.underline}.

A closer look at the NPT reveals that in terms of nuclear
non-proliferation, the NPT paved the way for multilateral agreements to
control the horizontal spread of all sorts of nuclear weapons.
[States]{.underline} may have [continued to prioritise non-proliferation
over **disarmament**]{.underline}. With a few exceptions, most arms
control agreements and arrangements were tied to the two superpowers,
namely the United States and the erstwhile Soviet Union. Although this
provided stability between the US and the Soviet Union, they failed to
generate any momentum for the issue of disarmament. Despite the fact
that nuclear disarmament discussions took place concurrently on UN
platforms, several factors such as differences among different countries
leadership\'s strategic vision and priorities marred any meaningful
progress towards the objective of nuclear disarmament. The situation was
further complicated by the fact that despite its successes, [the NPT
itself **divided** the **world** into nuclear **haves** and
**have-nots** by recognising five signatories as NWS, while the
remaining signatories categorised as NNWS]{.underline},
**[prohibited]{.underline}** [from **developing** nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. By doing this, [the NPT legitimises the
**continued possession** of **nuclear weapons** by five NWS while
supporting disarmament of the unarmed states, resulting in a **sharp
divide**]{.underline} between NWS and NNWS. Additionally, [while NWS
were supposed to **end** their nuclear **arms race** and ultimately
**eliminate** their nuclear weapons]{.underline}, article VI of [the NPT
does not provide a **deadline** or a **verification mechanism** for
disarmament]{.underline}. This led William Walker to argue that the
legitimacy of the nuclear order thus rested on mutual obligations and
reciprocity. He went on to contend that [this **nuclear order** was
established on the **understanding** that the five nuclear-weapons
states\' **possession** of such weapons constituted an **impermanent
trust** that was **inapplicable** to any other
nation-state]{.underline}. This also meant that the NWS would be acting
together to avoid horizontal proliferation. This was due to the fact
that new entrants to the nuclear clubs would bring along their own
threat perceptions and insecurities resulting in further disturbance in
the power balance and that regional and international power structures
would continuously be unstable.

Looking at the international [nuclear non-proliferation]{.underline} as
being practiced, it appears that it [is a classic case of **organised
hypocrisy**]{.underline}. Originally propagated by Swedish theorist Nils
Brunsson, the concept of organised hypocrisy was popularised by Stephen
Krasner.3 Krasner defines [organised hypocrisy as an inherent part of
the complex international system where a state\'s actions **contradict**
the standards and values it **nominally supports**.]{.underline} The
literature on organised hypocrisy informs us that [the **construction**
of public narratives about **selective standards** of non-proliferation
and their **uneven implementation** in particular instances has been a
**significant component** of organised hypocrisy]{.underline}.
Krasner\'s description of [organised hypocrisy is grounded in the
\"neoclassical **realism**,\"]{.underline} as the emphasis is on
decision making elites rather than states. According to Krasner, as the
rulers intend to continue to stay in power, they, while in power,
according to Krasner \"\... want to promote the security, prosperity,
and values of their constituents.\" He further argues that [**organised
hypocrisy** is a means by which the political **leadership** and the
elites **manage** the international and the domestic requirements that
often **conflict** or clash]{.underline}. In a situation when these
requirements collide or clash, the elites decouple their policy
responses leading to what is described as inconsistent rhetoric or
behaviour or in other words organised hypocrisy. This according to
Krasner is a rational choice.

#### The non-proliferation regime [divides]{.underline} the world into a [two-tier hierarchy]{.underline} between the nuclear club and the atomic unarmed. That positioning justifies the U.S. as the "*[police of the world]{.underline}*" where it must [militarily intervene]{.underline} to prevent the [spread]{.underline} of nuclear weapons.

\*Edited for language

[The]{.underline} simple **[injustice]{.underline}** [at its
**heart**]{.underline} [has **haunted** nuclear
nonproliferation]{.underline} since the Irish Resolution. The nonaligned
and neutral members of the ENDC repeatedly asked why a growing nuclear
club and the U.S.-Soviet arms race were incommensurable, drawing an
equivalence between \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" proliferation.
[Military industry was a moving target. Warheads and delivery vehicles
developed **qualitatively**]{.underline} through technical
sophistication such as miniaturization and also quantitatively through
the sheer accumulation of stockpiles and arsenals. [The **discriminatory
purpose** of the **nonproliferation** regime fell afoul of central
tenets of]{.underline} postcolonial visions of world order:
[universality, nondiscrimination, and **equality**]{.underline}. [Even a
nuclear freeze would leave the **atomic unarmed** at a
**disadvantage**]{.underline}. Italy\'s delegate in Geneva observed in
February 1967 that \"effectiveness\" and \"equity\" were \"closely
interdependent\": \"[There could be no universal approbation for a
non-proliferation treaty that established a perpetual discrimination
between **two classes** of **countries**]{.underline}.\" He approvingly
quoted Frank Aiken\'s contention that [**nuclear restraint** should be
the **starting point** for the **control** and **gradual elimination**
of nuclear arms, not the **perpetuation** of a **\"pax
Atomica."**]{.underline}

Yet the record over the past fifty years has been mixed. Lyndon Johnson
and Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin announced strategic arms and
anti-ballistic-missile (ABM) limitation at the ceremony celebrating the
NPT\'s opening for signature on July 1, 1968. The Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty (SALT) that the governments of Richard Nixon and
Leonid Brezhnev finalized in 1972 capped arsenals without dismantling a
single warhead, leading Swedish disarmament minister Alva Myrdal to
denounce the Soviet Union and the United States for defaulting on
Article VI and thus playing \"the game of disarmament.\" It was not
until 1987 that the superpowers liquidated any portion of their arsenals
when Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which eliminated all ballistic and cruise
missiles whose ranges fell between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Successive
U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Russian agreements the 1991 Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START), the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty
(SORT), and the 2011 New START-have cut deployed warhead numbers on both

[Notwithstanding]{.underline} these **[forward leaps]{.underline}**,
however, [the **position** of the non-nuclear-weapon states never
changed]{.underline}. [With a **numerator** of zero, the ratio of their
**atomic inferiority** remains **unbounded**]{.underline}. [Their
grievances are **categorical**, all the more so as all nine legal and
extralegal members of the nuclear club are now **modernizing** their

In the interim, [the indefinite extension of the NPT]{.underline} in

**arms control steps**]{.underline}. Since January 2021, when the Treaty
on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons came into effect, consummating the
Gromyko proposal of 1946 and the International Committee of the Red
Cross\'s 1950 endorsement of \"the prohibition of atomic weapons,\" the
NPT regime faces competition. The remarks of the Argentinian ambassador
to the UN in 1968 still resonate more than a half century later: above
all, [the treaty exists to enforce the **\"disarmament of the

The nuclear club\'s foundation from 1945 to 1970 refashioned the Cold
War and U.S. global power, or what others less enamored of their reach
would style Soviet and U.S. hegemonies. Though the Soviet Union left its
marks on the new nuclear order, as did U.S. and Soviet allies in
addition to neutral and nonaligned nations in Geneva and New York, [the
nuclear club relied on the **structural power** of the United
States.]{.underline} [The NPT]{.underline} accordingly
**[renewed]{.underline}** [a liberal world order that]{.underline}
senior [U.S. government officials viewed as]{.underline} providential in
[a bid to **absolve** U.S. **armed might**]{.underline} amid its
greatest crisis--- the Vietnam War. [Powerful forces]{.underline} in the
executive and legislative branches [adopted the cause of **nuclear
nonproliferation**]{.underline} for reasons both high-minded and
self-serving: to lower the odds of an ecocidal war and [to **secure**
their self-appointed right to **shape the world** as they
**pleased**]{.underline}, even as a diffusion of power made
international politics ever more unbiddable to Washington\'s best and
brightest.

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS END\>\>\>

The NPT extended to nuclear science and technology a world order based
on the imperial presidency. Efforts to reduce the number of fingers on
the button were in many ways extensions of efforts to concentrate
nuclear decision making in the Office of the President that went back to
Harry S. Truman\'s shock at Nagasaki\'s destruction and debates about
pre-delegation and nuclear sharing in the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and
Johnson years.\" Nixon\'s and Kissinger\'s ambivalence toward
nonproliferation was not atypical. For all the credit they deserved for
negotiating the Moscow Treaty and the NPT, and for acquiescing to the
Treaty of Tlatelolco, Kennedy and Johnson had stopped short of punishing
Israel, meeting India halfway, or twisting the arm of the West German
chancellor or the Japanese prime minister. Nixon\'s Democratic rivals
had cast themselves as nuclear guardians to help win numerous elections.
Nuclear testing and the atom bomb\'s prevalence in popular culture
served as connective tissue between U.S. armed forces and America\'s
baby boom, and U.S. presidents found it expedient to defend their
policies by vowing to protect home-owning families from nuclear
annihilation. The social origins of détente reached deep into the
country\'s growing suburbs, as the White House pledged to defend
innocent children to sell voters on a major arms control agreement with
the Soviet Union, couching a nuclear-test-ban treaty as the best way to
stop atmospheric testing from poisoning innocent young girls and boys.\"
At American University in June 1963, Kennedy had asked whether fallout
was not \"a matter of human rights---the right to live out our lives
without fear of devastation-the right to breathe air as nature provided
it-the right of future generations to a healthy existence.\" Under
Johnson the White House upheld its authority over nuclear war and peace
by recasting the president as humanity\'s paternal protector. The real
contrast between Johnson and Nixon was that the NPT had already
internationalized nuclear politics by the time the latter entered
office. Where presidential indecision would have previously spelled
deadlock, Nixon\'s indifference merely yielded inertia, even as Nixon
and Kissinger also found themselves catering to the anxieties of
suburban voters for law, order, and security. For Moscow, the nuclear
nonproliferation regime eased the chief terror of recent memory---the
forward thrust of German industry, nationalism, and militarism---while
securing Soviet leadership over the international communist movement in
the face of the Maoist challenge. The Kremlin\'s message to the Indian
communist party offered an inventory of the advantages that Soviet
statesmen believed would accrue from the NPT: \"West Germany, Japan,
Israel, Italy, Canada, the Republic of South Africa, Swe- den, Brazil,
and a number of other countries, including India, are prepared in their
scientific and technical level or almost prepared to begin the
production of nuclear weapons.\" With the exception of India, every
country on the list was \"capitalist\" and correspondingly a U.S. ally
or partner whose nuclearization would diminish the relative power of the
Warsaw Pact. Even in a letter to comrades living thousands of miles from
Berlin, the Central Committee felt the need to reiterate that the
nonproliferation treaty \"ought to also be viewed as a means to protect
against West Germany having access to nuclear weapons.\"148

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>\>

[Most consequential]{.underline} of all [was the **redemption** of
**superpower military intervention** in the name of **nuclear
nonproliferation**]{.underline}. Walt Rostow entered the White House in
1961 seeking a \"common law for the Cold War.\" As Johnson\'s national
security advisor during the standoff between Europe-first champions of
the MLF and globalists supportive of an nonproliferation accord, he
viewed the question as \"how the West and Asia may decide, with us, to
organize nuclear arrangements in the future.\" Well after Johnson had
sunk the MLF in deference to French and Soviet objections, Rostow pushed
an Asian MLF that would have made atom bombs available to Indian air
forces in the event of a communist Chinese incursion or atomic
blackmail. He exited the White House convinced that nuclear
nonproliferation and the Vietnam War were two sides of the same coin:
the delicate credibility of U.S. military commitments. He warned the
National War College graduates in May 1968 that if the country failed in
Vietnam, it would not be long before \"India and Japan produced their
own nuclear weapons.\" \"If we mean it,\" he concluded, [\"the NPT would
ask them to take \"a **position**, as a nation, which does **not
permit** us to **back** away much from the world.\"]{.underline}50

The father of the neoconservative movement, Irving Kristol spoke much
the same language in the New York Times that week-though his Manichean
worldview yielded more dire predictions. In a magazine article that came
out the Sunday before Rostow\'s speech, Kristol had argued that [the
United States could never \"resign as]{.underline}
\'~~policeman~~[**\[police\] of the world\"**-U.S. leadership was too
critical to]{.underline} \"the preservation of a decent level of
[international **law** and **order**]{.underline}.\" As antiwar
sentiment portended a nation less willing to fight limited wars abroad,
insecure nations around the globe would have no choice but to arm
themselves with the most powerful weapons. \"It may yet turn out to be
one of the great ironies of world history that the United States and the
Soviet Union,\" he alerted his readers, \"should have succeeded in
negotiating a nonproliferation agreement at the very moment when such an
agreement could only be another scrap of paper.\" Rostow underlined this
claim when he forwarded the article to President Johnson, though neither
man needed convincing that to abandon South Vietnam would wreck harm on
the worldwide credibility of the United States and the liberal world
order over which they thought themselves privileged to preside.

A [treaty]{.underline} that Frank Aiken had prayed would preserve world
peace until \"the rule of law replace\[d\] brute force in the settlement
of international disputes\" [had yielded a **two-tier postcolonial
hierarchy** in which ambiguous **nuclear \"threats\"** could
**supersede**]{.underline} the UN Charter\'s [ban on wars]{.underline}
of choice. Many attributes have distinguished the long peace in North
America and Europe since 1945 from the [**\"killing fields\"** of
Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East]{.underline}, though
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 now stands as evidence
that that geographical exemption may no longer hold.\" [One has been an
enduring distinction between the **nuclear club** and the **rest of
humanity**]{.underline}, in whose name its members and above all [the
United States have recurrently intervened to stop **any hands save their
own** from wielding **weapons** of mass destruction]{.underline}. For
decades, this counterrevolution has averted a world teeming with nuclear
powers. Even so, as long as a justice of equals eludes any community, a
revolution can never be fully ruled out.

How long, he asked the graduating officers in their dress uniforms,
until \"Germany, Japan, Italy, India, and others\" built the atom bomb?
[The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]{.underline}
(**[NPT]{.underline}**) [that the United Nations (**UN**) was
debating]{.underline} in New York would ask for higher sacrifices than
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the Alliance for
Progress in Latin America, for which the United States had merely
assumed a "due share in a communal effort." To the average American
voter or to foreign leaders fearful of second- or third-class status,
the U.S. State Department had billed the agreement as a natural
successor to the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the
Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Under Water-\"that is, an exercise in
U.S.-Soviet détente, a good deed in a naughty world.\" In truth, [U.S.
leaders]{.underline} and their Soviet counterparts [shared a
**compelling interest** in **halting** \"the potential **diffusion** of
power at its most important point.\" This new world order would
**require**, above all, a **steady appetite** for **overseas
adventur**es to enforce on the world\'s **unruly masses** a common law
for the nuclear age.]{.underline} [The treaty negotiations]{.underline}
thus [marked a]{.underline} subtle but **[momentous shift]{.underline}**
[in how the world **governed** itself]{.underline} with the help of
far-flung U.S. legionnaires, as Rostow and Johnson prepared to lock the
country \"into responsibility in the world-right around the periphery of
Communist China and the Soviet Union, on the toughest of all issues.\"2

As Rostow [linked **victory**]{.underline} in Vietnam [to an **endless
crusade** against the **runaway atom**]{.underline}, the UN First
Committee was meeting in Manhattan\'s tony midtown neighbor- hood of
Turtle Bay. Over the first eight plenary sessions clear divisions had
revealed themselves in the sprawling complex, where representatives from
developing countries faced off against those with commanding leads in
world nuclear markets. On 16 May, Mexican deputy foreign minister
Alfonso García Robles made the case for surgical revisions to the NPT
that would help atomic newcomers catch up to more industrialized
countries. To drive his points home, he compared the new accord with the
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, known as
the Treaty of Tlatelolco after the Aztec square in Mexico City where it
had been finalized the previous year, whose lack of discriminatory
features made it \"far superior to the draft before us.\" For the NPT to
earn a commanding majority in the UN General Assembly (UNGA), where
Latin American and African delegations had enjoyed numerical dominance
since 1965, García Robles challenged his audience to revise its preamble
and articles so that they looked more like those in the Treaty of
Tlatelolco.

After the Second World War, a cosmopolitan community of politicians,
activists, bureaucrats, scientists, and diplomats constructed a
near-universal regime to man- age the most powerful technology ever
devised the power to split or fuse atomic nuclei to release wondrous new
isotopes for medical cures and energy production or unprecedented
explosive force for mass destruction and death. After numerous false
starts, their campaign bore fruit in the 1960s, when multiplying
regional crises and an emerging world market in fission reactors led an
international society in the throes of decolonization to draw up a Magna
Carta for the subatomic realm.

In combination with the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), referred to at
the time as the Moscow Treaty, and the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the NPT
enforced five rules for the nuclear realm. First, nuclear experiments
that states conduct cannot spread radioactive fallout beyond their
borders or those of trustee territories, effectively sealing them
underground. Second, in the event they agreed among themselves, regional
blocs can banish atomic means of destruction from their neighborhoods.
Third, the official nuclear club would close to new entrants on New
Year\'s Day 1967, with the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
the Soviet Union, and the People\'s Republic of China (PRC)
prestigiously included as legacy members. Fourth, the international
community recognized an inalienable right to peaceful science and
technology. Finally, in exchange for legitimation under international
law, the five legacy members, now authorized as nuclear-weapon states,
would make concerted efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate the
world-threatening arsenals that distinguished them from the atomic
unarmed.

Today [the global **nonproliferation regime**]{.underline} [that the NPT
constituted is a **centerpiece** of world politics]{.underline}. The
United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union moved all their
nuclear testing underground after August 1963. France followed suit in
1974, and the PRC six years after that. More than fifty years later, the
Treaty of Tlatelolco remains a template for existing and prospective
zones free of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific, Southeast Asia,
Africa, central Asia, and the Middle East. Since 1968, on net the
unofficial nuclear club has grown by only four members. Four
countries-South Africa, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine-gave up their
arsenals during that time, as [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline},
at times authorized by the UN Security Council (UNSC) and at others
abetted by willing partners, [has **intervened** repeatedly to inhibit
**nuclear spread** by means of financial **sanctions**,
**cyberattacks**, cruise **missiles**, covert **assassinations**, and
**foreign expeditions**]{.underline}. So far [the global nuclear
nonproliferation regime has]{.underline} for the most part [achieved its
headline goal]{.underline}-to ensure that the peaceful atom would not be
diverted to violent ends. It has [done so by **perpetuating hierarchy**
among nations at the cost of **displacing violence** from the
**developed** to the **developing** worlds]{.underline} a marriage of
convenience between humanitarian ideals and U.S. military supremacy.

The Nuclear Club recounts how what began as an attempt to build world
government under law became a warrant for defying the UN Charter. If
there is a [central myth of the nuclear age, it is that nuclear arms
rendered great-power war **obsolete**]{.underline}. While scholars have
taken pains to identify the exact conditions that ushered [in this
\"Long Peace\"]{.underline}---or disputed its scope or the necessity of
nuclear weapons to it---most agree that the nuclear revolution has been
a major determinant of patterns of war and peace since 1945. What these
[narratives omit is the **correlation** between the stability that
nuclear deterrence has enforced-the non-occurrence of **shooting wars**
between nuclear-club members and the **frequency** of civil wars,
**proxy** conflicts, and territorial disputes for those **outside its
ranks**.?]{.underline} [The Long Peace has]{.underline} been real but
far [from **universal**]{.underline}. World War III has not happened
(yet), but [the scourge of war continues to **afflict** those **denied
membership** in the world\'s **most exclusive club.**]{.underline}

[The NPT\'s founding **purpose**]{.underline} [was **not
peace**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} rather [to nip the revolutionary
potential of atomic physics in the **bud**]{.underline}. [The global
nuclear nonproliferation regime]{.underline} established more than a set
of laws, rules, and norms to regulate atomic power worldwide---it
[**sanctified** UNSC permanent members\' **nuclear arsenals** and also
their **right to intervene** abroad to **save humanity** from the
**Promethean handiwork** they themselves]{.underline} **[had
wrought]{.underline}**. Many features distinguished the geographic core
in North America and western Eurasia, where the Long Peace prevailed,
from what Paul Cham- berlin styles the Cold War\'s \"killing fields\" in
Asia and the Middle East. Among them was a [distinction between the
**members** of the **nuclear club**-foremost among them the world\'s
chief hegemon, the **United States**]{.underline}-[and those whom they
promised to **protect** from **themselves**]{.underline}, a dividing
line that has outlived the Cold War. Weeks before Rostow\'s commencement
speech on the banks of the Washington Channel, French foreign ministry
lawyers had noticed that the UNSC resolution that would accompany [the
NPT **hierarchized** forms of **aggression** by elevating **nuclear**
above **non-nuclear** forms of state violence while
**introducing**]{.underline} into public international law [an
\"**ambiguous concept** of **\'menace.\"**]{.underline} Theirs was a
premonition of how [**nuclear nonproliferation** would join
**humanitarian intervention** as the chief caveats to the UN
Charter\'s]{.underline} [general ban on **wars of
aggression**]{.underline}. [Thirty-three years after the NPT entered
into force, their prophecy would be realized in the ruins of Iraq and
the decades of upheaval that Operation Enduring Freedom would
**unleash** in and around the **Middle East**]{.underline}.

[In]{.underline} the context of **[economics]{.underline}**, ostensibly,
[many associate the word securitization with **financial
terms**]{.underline}. However, this paper suggests interpreting the term
literally. By definition, [the goal of **securitization** of the economy
is to protect]{.underline} both **[economic]{.underline}** and
non-economic [areas of **national interest**]{.underline} against sudden
disruptions caused by potential security threats. [The
success]{.underline} of securitization depends on whether or not the
securitizing actors can proceed with a speech act. This [depends on how
the target audience **perceives** a **designated issue** as an
**existential threat** that requires extraordinary measures to safeguard
the referent obje]{.underline}ct. [The **oft-mentioned** existential
threats]{.underline} within the scope of the securitization of the
economy are [supply chain risks, technology transfer problems,
intellectual property theft, and geopolitical risks]{.underline}.
Securitizing moves proceed with two types of tools.17 The first
comprises regulatory instruments (e.g., policy regulations or
constitutions) that authorize or prohibit certain practices in an
attempt to influence the behavior of security actors. The second type of
tool is bureaucratic practices that impose external influences or
disciplines on the actors. [In the case of the **securitization** of the
economy, the **final manifestation** can be seen in a country's
political action of **weaponizing** interdependence to protect one
nation's **economic interests**]{.underline}. In the name of protecting
a nation's economic security -- [economic interests and values-
**economic warfare** is what we can **perceive** as]{.underline} an

Regardless of how the various parties understood China\'s motives, the
clear implication was that **[REMS]{.underline}** [had become a
**highly-securitised**]{.underline} [domain]{.underline} of
international resource politics. [REM-using industrial
firms]{.underline} were badly impacted by price rises and aggressively
[lobbied Western **governments**]{.underline} to act to help break the
Chinese monopoly. [The link to **defence applications** created
considerable **anxiety** in Washington]{.underline} regarding the wisdom
of relying on supply from a potential military rival. [Western
governments could no longer leave REM supply **\'to the

strategically important industry to the whim of Chinese policymakers.
[Securitisation]{.underline} thus [justified the deployment of

[Non-proliferation is **not hypocritical**]{.underline} [if it is based
on an **impartial** and **realistic estimation** of risks]{.underline}.
But if a state like North Korea or Iran decides to accept such risks,
should that be purely its own choice?

Perhaps, if the risks were borne solely by its own people, but they are
not. [Third parties are **justified** in rejecting the risks that would
be **imposed** upon them]{.underline}. The history of proliferation
shows that political chain reactions often occur -- witness China,
India, and Pakistan -- and there are real fears that North Korea and
Iran might trigger such chains in Northeast Asia and the Middle East.

Some people argue that nuclear proliferation will actually reduce risks.
Call it the "porcupine theory." In such a prickly world, no country
would dare aggression. But this assumes perfect rationality. [In the
**real world**, accidents occur, so more proliferation means a **greater
chance** of eventual inadvertent use, weaker capacity in managing
nuclear crises, and **greater difficulty** in establishing controls and
reducing the role of nuclear weapons in world politics.]{.underline}

In addition, [the more states possess nuclear weapons, the greater the
prospects that **terrorists** will gain **access** to them]{.underline}.
Of course, transnational terrorists usually have no "return address"
that allows the threat of mutual deterrence to work, but North Korea or
Iran has no moral right to impose this risk upon others.

While many Western observers viewed the outcome of the WTO case as the
end of the REMS saga, in reality it was a symbolic victory. By the time
of the DS431 ruling in August 2014, the Chinese government had already
lost its stranglehold on the global REMs market. As noted, [the
**securitisation** of REMS had **induced** Western governments to
undertake a **series** of diplomatic, financial and legal
**counter-measures** against **China**\'s monopoly power]{.underline}.
[These counter-measures brought]{.underline} immediate and [**decisive
results**.]{.underline} Within only two years, a combination of new
suppliers, [Chinese institutional weaknesses and basic market forces
would conspire to **neutralize** China\'s ability to wield the **REMS
weapon.**]{.underline}

First, the [**economic consequence** of Chinese restrictions was a
**dramatic dampening** of global REM demand]{.underline}. With prices
surging and anxieties about supply security intensifying, [industrial
consumers **scrambled** to reduce their dependence on Chinese oxides
through **substitution** and **recycling**]{.underline}. Japanese
industry- which accounts for approximately half of global consumption -
led the way. [Oil companies stopped using lanthanum]{.underline} as a
refining catalyst, while [specialty glass producers substituted
zirconium for cerium]{.underline} in polishing agents. The [neodymium
magnet industry]{.underline} devised within-process recycling techniques
which [reduced primary oxide demand by 30 percent]{.underline}, and
several Japanese firms began programs to extract REMS from consumer
electronics waste. In 2011, France\'s Rhodia Group restarted separation
plants which could extract REMS from recycled fluorescent lamps and
magnets, a process which had become commercially viable due to
record-level oxide prices (Gholz 2014; Seaman 2012). By lowering
consumption and opening new material streams, these corporate
[initiatives greatly **reduced demand** for Chinese oxides]{.underline}.
By 2014, world imports of REM oxides from China had fallen to 6,000
tonnes, less than half the historical peak set in 2007 (Figure 8.2).

Scholars have continued to argue for the [benefits of
**securitisation**]{.underline}. First, [engagement with
political]{.underline} interests [may be **useful**]{.underline} for
outlining appropriate strategic responses. The act of [control over
water resources]{.underline} can be perceived as an [enhancement of
state sovereignty and strength]{.underline} and thus, [a securitised
response to the situation can be **perceived** as
**productive**]{.underline}. Secondly, [all actors involved in a
contentious issue hold a stake]{.underline}, therefore, political
inclusion of the riparians is necessary, where agreements reached
without the inclusion of all affected parties are not equitable. Third,
the various economic trade-offs involved in responding to a climate
crisis can be dealt with by engaging with all stages of the mitigation
process which emerges from bilateral deliberations. Lastly, [adding a
**security affliction**]{.underline} to an environmental issue [can help
bring it to the **forefront** and **enhance** public
awareness]{.underline}. In an elaborately organised modern state,
addressing the concern, regardless of its impediments, is crucial.

**[Citizen involvement]{.underline}** [in trade]{.underline} and
investment [policymaking]{.underline} and related institutions [is
essential for **building** effective social **dimensions** into regional
and global economic integration plans.]{.underline}

[Social actors]{.underline} have found some footholds for influencing
trade policies and participating in related institutions. They [must go
further to challenge the **insider status** of corporate economic
elites.]{.underline}

[Recent trade]{.underline} and investment [negotiations have shown that
neither a democratic opening in **policy debates** nor citizen
access]{.underline} to new institutions [are conceded. They must be
**won** by **organizing**.]{.underline}

[Shaping **new international rules** for labor rights, environmental
protection, gender equity, minority rights, sustainable development, and
other social goals is a formidable political challenge in view of the
forces promoting profit-above-all trade]{.underline} and investment
policies.

The 1998 Summit of the Americas meeting of heads of state and trade
ministers in Santiago, Chile, reflected the balance of power in the
trade and investment debate. Elite corporate and financial circles mixed
fluidly with government officials in the gleaming uptown luxury hotels
of the official summit, making plans for a Free Trade Agreement of the
Americas (FTAA) by 2005. Meanwhile, advocates for protection of workers,
the environment, human rights, and other social causes were shunted to
Santiago's graying downtown. In an alternative Peoples' Summit there,
they debated ways to implement principles of social justice in trade and
investment policies. [A thorough **democratization** of **policy
debates** and decisionmaking is a **precondition** for progress in
adding social dimensions to **trade** and **investment**
regimes]{.underline}. [**Democratizing** the trade debate means
conceding **social justice** advocates a serious participatory role
in]{.underline} shaping the rules of [economic integration]{.underline}
and in the operations of the bodies that implement new rules. Without
the proverbial "seat at the table," social justice advocates will
continue to see their concerns treated as afterthoughts.
