**[[Tariff]{.underline}]{.mark}** development[**[s]{.mark}** [**don't
change** the]{.mark} **broad [growth story]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[We've only made relatively **small downward adjustments** to
our]{.underline} global **[GDP growth]{.underline}** forecasts for this
year and next despite the considerable tariff drama at the start of
February. We've lowered our world GDP **growth** forecasts by 0.1ppt to
2.8% in both 2025 and 2026. We've made only small downward revisions for
two key reasons.

First, [global GDP growth]{.underline} in Q4 2024 [was revised up, most
notably due to China's strong end]{.underline} to last year. This
strength mechanically helped to push up China's calendar year forecast
for 2025 by 0.2ppts to 4.6%, **[countering]{.underline}** [some of the
**dampening effects** from tariffs]{.underline} elsewhere.

Second, [we expect the US to hike tariffs by **less** than **Trump has
threatened**]{.underline}. We still think [[Trump sees tariffs]{.mark}
mainly [as **leverage**]{.mark} **in negotiations**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} that **[[deals can be made]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to
**prevent**]{.mark} or limit US tariff [action]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, [Mexico and [Canada **won**]{.mark}]{.underline} one-month
[**[reprieves]{.mark}** on major tariff increases [by making]{.mark}
[**concessions** that]{.mark} will [incur]{.mark} **only [small
costs]{.mark}**]{.underline} relative to the disruption from sudden and
dramatic tariff hikes. Despite the volatility in early February, it's
not clear that the risks surrounding tariffs have taken a dramatic turn
for the worse.

Overall, we've brought forward the likely timing of US tariff hikes by a
couple of quarters. [For **Canada**]{.underline}, we now expect broader
tariff increases than assumed a month ago, but [we think the measures
still **fall short** of what Trump threatened to impose]{.underline} at
the start of this year. We have also assumed a blanket 10% tariff will
be imposed on the EU towards the end of Q1 as Trump broadens his focus
from China and the US' neighbours.

[Trump's pledge to raise tariffs on **[steel and
aluminium]{.mark}**]{.underline} imports to 25% doesn't affect our
baseline forecast at this point. We had already incorporated a
watered-down version in our baseline, assuming at least 10% tariffs on
metals from many key US import markets, including the EU, China, Canada,
and Mexico. This [is consistent with the use of tariffs as a
negotiating]{.underline} tool. While the announcement will have key
repercussions for metals producers and US firms that use metals as a key
production input, [the marginal [effects]{.mark} of specific metals
tariffs on overall GDP and inflation [will be
**small**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

We now anticipate slightly higher US inflation and a more cautious pace
of cuts by the Federal Reserve. But [[the **squeeze** on]{.mark} real
household [incomes **won't undermine**]{.mark} **existing [strong
fundamentals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The adverse effects would have been
far worse if Trump had carried out his February 1 tariff threats -- we
have produced new scenarios to measure the likely consequences if
tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada rise to 25%.

We've lowered our US GDP growth forecast for 2025, but the reduction of
0.2ppts to 2.4% leaves the US exceptionalism story still intact. We've
downgraded our eurozone GDP growth forecast for 2025 by 0.3ppts to 0.9%.
Despite our assumption that the US will impose a 10% tariff rate on the
EU and that the bloc retaliates, US trade as a share of GDP is too small
for this to have substantial impact, at least at a macro level. Some of
the eurozone cut reflects the weak growth outturn in Q4 2024.

#### Successful climate policy [crashes the Canadian econ]{.underline} by slashing oil demand and prices. Independently, [green paradox]{.underline} turns case.

ESG Credentials Will Not Preserve Canadian Oil's Market Share

[If Canada were **vying** to sell the proverbial **last barrel of oil**,
would it matter how its oil was produced]{.underline}?
[Would]{.underline} greenhouse gas (**[GHG]{.underline}**) **[intensity
matter]{.underline}**, for example, or would it matter whether it was
considered "ethical" or produced to high ESG standards? The short answer
is: **[probably not]{.underline}**.

For some products, production methods impact marketability. At
comparable price and quality, final consumers will favour "green" and
ethically produced products. For goods like food, clothing, and
electronics, a variety of labelling schemes allow consumers to choose,
even to pay a premium for labelled products. But for commodities like
oil, the situation is different. When refined Canadian oil is finally
sold at the pumps, it is indistinguishable from other gasoline, and
tracking the source at the retail level would be daunting. The original
customers are mostly U.S. refiners dependent on the supply of heavy
Canadian crude, as detailed above, who focus on quantity, quality, and
price---not ESG. ESG considerations clearly matter a great deal to oil
sector investors, but they do not preoccupy most customers. While
investors influence companies' ability to finance expansion, new
projects, and infrastructure, they don't buy the final product, and
therefore their opinions don't directly affect a company's market share.
This will be especially true in the context of a shrinking market in
which Canadian producers will not need to expand operations to compete
for the few remaining buyers. Canadian crude oil's emissions intensity
would matter if the United States implemented a clean fuel standard
governing the life-cycle carbon content of transportation fuels such as
gasoline. By design, such a standard would reduce the market share of
crude oil produced at high emissions intensity, including most of
Canada's U.S. exports (see Box 1). California, Oregon, and Washington
have clean fuel standards in place. But, while such a policy has been
suggested by legislators, it would face strong opposition from the
domestic refining sector and raise the price of gasoline for American
drivers, making it unlikely to pass in the foreseeable future.

Box 1. How does Canadian crude oil measure up on GHG emissions
intensity?

Beyond the question of whether ESG matters for Canadian oil's market
share is the more basic matter of whether Canada's producers are, in
fact, world leaders on ESG criteria, as claimed by some industry groups
and pundits.

On environmental performance, the section above makes it clear that
[[Canada's]{.underline}]{.mark} overall **[[GHG
intensity]{.underline}]{.mark}** of production **[[is not world
class]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Beyond emissions, [Canada's]{.mark} oil
sands [operations]{.mark} [have been **dogged**]{.mark} for years
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} a record of serious water and **[air
[pollution]{.mark} impacts]{.underline}**. Those impacts were singled
out as disproportionately affecting Indigenous peoples by the United
Nations Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the
environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances
and wastes.

Oil sands development has been responsible for extensive impacts on the
traditional territories of many First Nations in Alberta, in violation
of treaty rights and without proper consultation or respect for basic
principles such as cumulative effects management. In many instances, the
industry's consultations and impact assessments with respect to Cree,
Dene, and Métis rights have been designed in a manner to expedite oil
sands development. Members of many Nations in the region, such as
Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and Fort McKay First Nation, have
denounced these impacts for decades. Additionally, the Beaver Lake Cree
Nation has an ongoing lawsuit against the governments of Alberta and
Canada on the basis that the cumulative impacts of this industrial
development violate their Treaty 6 rights.

While ESG matters to investors and to builders of pipelines seeking
social license, it does not matter to the refineries that buy Canada's
oil.

[Canadian producers' mismanagement of the end of the oil and gas project
life cycle should also be considered]{.underline}. In Alberta, as of
September 2022, 3,309 [oil and gas sites are considered orphaned,
meaning the original owners failed to fulfill their responsibility for
costly end-of-life decommissioning and restoration]{.underline}. Many of
those sites were strategically sold to insolvent operators.
Responsibility for them now falls to the industry-funded Orphan Well
Association, but current industry contributions are grossly inadequate.
The Association has CAD 169 million in assets against orphaned sites
that it estimates will cost almost CAD 700 million to clean up.
Liability estimates for all existing sites are much higher, reaching up
to CAD 260 billion. The difference has partly been borne by taxpayers
through government loans and bailouts to treat inactive and orphaned
wells, violating the polluter-pays principle. But most orphan wells
remain unremediated, and a large proportion of "active" wells are, in
fact, inactive but not declared as such, meaning the farmers and
ranchers on whose land they sit suffer the environmental and economic
consequences.

Similarly, it is arguably an ESG issue that some Alberta oil and gas
companies owe hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid municipal taxes
and tens of millions of dollars in unpaid lease payments to landowners.

Some insist the last barrel of oil should be sold by a country like
Canada that respects democracy and human rights. However, this is
largely beside the point: while Canada as a country may have better ESG
institutions than many of the world's top oil-producing countries, ESG
criteria traditionally centre on the behaviour of the firm in question,
not the government policies where they happen to operate. Some Canadian
oil producers score well on ESG criteria, and others score poorly.

Ultimately, however, whether Canada's producers' ESG rating should
preserve its market share is irrelevant. As argued above, it won't;
buyers of Canadian oil don't discriminate on ESG grounds.

Canada Is Far From the Lowest-Cost Producer

If ESG status won't save Canadian oil's market share, [could Canada
compete on **price**]{.underline}? Most of Canada's crude oil exports do
not compete directly on global markets, though there are increasing
exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast that do, and there will be
substantially more with the completion of the TMX pipeline. And Canadian
crude does not compete directly with the lighter, sweeter crude produced
in most other countries. But [Canada's costs of production relative to
its major competitors still matter in the long run, especially in a
shrinking post-peak global market.]{.underline}

Figure 2 shows how those costs measure up among the top 10 oil-producing
nations, expressed here as the weighted average Brent crude U.S. dollar
per barrel breakeven price in each country. While costs of production
have come down dramatically in Canada over the last 20 years, [[Canada
is]{.mark} **still** [**not** a **low-cost**]{.mark} **oil
[producer]{.mark}**, especially compared to its Middle Eastern
competitors]{.underline}.

As of November 2022, the price of Brent crude is in the mid-eighties
(USD), so [prices could fall significantly before most Canadian
producers, with a weighted average breakeven oil price of USD
35]{.underline}.21, [became unprofitable. But [in a]{.mark} future
global [market with **falling demand** and **prices**]{.mark}, there
would be significant reserves and production in [countries]{.mark} that
[would continue to]{.mark} be **[profit]{.mark}**able **[long after
Canad]{.mark}**i**[a]{.mark}**n production is not.]{.underline}

The Post-Peak Market for Oil Will Be Savage

Despite Canada not currently participating directly in global markets,
[global supply and demand trends]{.underline}---and the prices that
result from them---[directly affect the price Canadian oil producers
receive]{.underline}. It is, therefore, important to forecast the
strategic behaviour of non-Canadian producers in response to what we
know is coming: a peak of global demand by around 2030, followed by a
marked decline.

[[In the face of]{.mark} **[lower returns]{.mark}** driven by **climate
policy**, [some]{.mark} have **[predict]{.mark}**ed]{.underline} a
dynamic known as **[[the green paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [where
[producers]{.mark} predict their reserves will be worth less in the
future]{.underline}, [and **[rush to extract and sell]{.mark}** more of
them in the present]{.underline}. [[This would mean lower prices]{.mark}
for **all**]{.underline} ([**[and more consumption]{.mark}** of cheap
oil, hence the paradox]{.underline}). Others have criticized this
theory, noting that significantly ramping up production is not a simple
matter for most producers, particularly in the short term.

In today's circumstances, however, [[the]{.mark} green [paradox would
**not necessitate** a difficult ramp-up]{.mark}---[it could]{.mark}
simply [amount to]{.mark} **deliberately [following existing
plans]{.mark}** in the face of declining demand. A survey of [production
plans]{.mark} for 12 major oil-producing countries **[show]{.mark}**s
projected **[increases]{.mark}** [by 2030]{.mark} amounting to more than
10% of 2020 global production]{.underline}. By contrast, under plausible
assumptions, global demand for oil could decline 22% by 2030 and more
steeply thereafter.

[International (private) oil companies might change expansion plans in
response to obvious decline trends; some shareholders would **likely
demand it**]{.underline}. In the same vein, Cairns (2014) also
criticizes the green paradox model on the grounds that it would be
economically irrational for major producers to increase production and
tank prices. But [more than half of global oil supply comes from
**[national]{.mark} oil [companies]{.mark}**. These companies are not
strictly profit motivated, and [are]{.mark} usually [mandated]{.mark} by
national governments [to contribute to]{.mark} broader policy
objectives, such as **creating [employment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some
[**[national governments]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} very likely **[demand a
ramp]{.mark}**ing-**[up]{.mark}** of production in the face of declining
demand and prices.]{.underline}

For decades, [global oil markets have been protected from oversupply
by]{.underline} the discipline of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (**[OPEC]{.underline}**) and, more recently,
OPEC-plus. [But the organization has always been **subject to
tensions**]{.underline}, with heavily oil-dependent members seeking to
increase production to address their urgent development needs.
[[**Declining oil prices** with **no**]{.mark} long-term **prospect for
price [recovery]{.mark}** [would **ratchet**]{.mark} **those [tensions
up]{.mark}** to new levels, [risking a loss of]{.mark} **collective
[discipline]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} resulting **[oversupply]{.mark}** and
volatility.]{.underline}

All things considered, [it is straightforward to predict whether Canada
will sell the last barrel of oil; **it will not.**]{.underline}

Conclusions

How will the coming peak and drop in global demand affect [Canadian
producers]{.underline}?

They will [face low and volatile prices for oil]{.underline}. There is a
mismatch between planned increases in production and potential decreases
in consumption, which indicates prices will also go down. [The weakening
of OPEC discipline in a post-peak-oil world may also create increased
price volatility, which has outsized impacts on investment, royalties,
and other elements of the]{.underline} Alberta [economy]{.underline} in
particular.

And they will face declining demand for their products. Canada's focus
on the United States as a destination market means it will be partly
sheltered from global demand effects---U.S. refiners will buy Canadian
crude even as global demand falls. But they will face increasing
pressure as export markets are curtailed and domestic consumption falls.
[The refineries that buy Canada's oil are large, complex, and low
cost]{.underline} and are likely to maintain markets for some time even
as demand shrinks, [but at some point, even they will curtail
production.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, Canada cannot count on its producers' (often questionable)
ESG credentials to preserve market share. While ESG matters to investors
and to builders of pipelines seeking social licence, it does not matter
to the refineries that buy Canada's oil; they are largely locked into
Canadian heavy crude by massive investments in the capacity to use it as
a feedstock.

[Neither can Canada rely on a low cost of production to help its
position]{.underline}. While Canadian producers have reduced costs
significantly since 2014, [their oil is, on average, still much more
costly than that of all the major Middle Eastern producers, which have
huge reserves and capacity. In a battle to sell the last barrel,
Canadian oil producers face a cost disadvantage.]{.underline}

All things considered, it is straightforward to predict whether Canada
will sell the last barrel of oil; it will not. But the more immediate
and fundamental question is this: [how will Canada fare in
the]{.underline} savage post-2030 [market of declining demand---a market
characterized by low prices and even more volatility than the historical
norm]{.underline}? **[[Canada]{.mark}'s]{.underline}** marginal
**[producers [will not survive]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [its more
efficient **[producers]{.mark}** [will reap **low profits**]{.mark},
[remitting low]{.mark} royalties and [taxes]{.mark}. New investments
will be almost **unthinkable**,]{.underline} other than incremental
extensions of existing operations. Based on past experience, [between
cost-cutting and lack of new investment, [the sector will
**shed**]{.mark} **large numbers of [workers]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The coming peak and drop in global demand matters for Canadian
producers---in the long run, [[it presents an **existential
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the near-to-medium term [it promises
to take the vitality out of a sector that has historically **contributed
enormously** [to the **Canadian**]{.mark} and provincial
**[econ]{.mark}**omies.]{.underline}

These realities are acutely important for Canadian government policy.
[Canada cannot afford to **delay**]{.underline} support for
[**diversifying** into sectors that can replace oil as an engine of
economic prosperity]{.underline} while simultaneously building a
cleaner, healthier world.

[Canadian [unity is **back on the agenda**, given]{.mark} the [strong
polling of the **P**]{.mark}]{.underline}arti
**[Q]{.underline}**uébécois and its commitment to a sovereignty
referendum. [With support for sovereignty at around 36 per cent, [there
is]{.mark} justifiable [**concern** over]{.mark} the outcome of [a
third]{.mark} Quebec [referendum]{.mark}]{.underline} campaign. For one,
[[it could **occur with a new recession**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
frequent incendiary comments from US President Donald Trump, who has
targeted the valuable American trade supporting our economy.

Even more concerning, as the gap between US and Canadian GDP per capita
widens, a recent Leger poll found 13 per cent of respondents supported
Canada as what Mr. Trump has called the '51st State', with 19 per cent
of respondents in Alberta endorsing Mr. Trump's suggestion, and 18 per
cent in Manitoba and Saskatchewan also being in favour of it. These
numbers from Western Canada are far from a majority, but they are
equivalent to half of the support for sovereignty in Quebec.

All of this points to a bitter truth: [[Our]{.mark} national [unity
crisis has cultural factors, but at the **source**]{.mark} of it
[are]{.mark} deep-seated **[economic issues]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
[weaknesses that have been starkly brought to the fore]{.underline} with
Mr. Trump's tariff threats. [[**Division thrives** when **living
standards** are **under threat**]{.mark}, when [people do not see their
government protecting them]{.mark} from economic shocks]{.underline}.
More than ever before, [Canada must prioritize its econ]{.underline}omy,
[because if we do not, we risk the country **falling
apart**.]{.underline}

We've had a taste of this moment before[. At the time of the **1980**
referendum]{.underline}, when [**inflation was high** and the Canadian
**econ**omy **was weak**]{.underline}, there was widespread belief that
should Quebec vote for sovereignty, the remaining provinces would be
swallowed up by the United States. Through the twists and turns of
constitutional politics between 1980 and 1995, and as inflation
subsided, confidence grew among English Canadians that Canada would
carry on even if Quebec opted for sovereignty. However, the divisive
political battles, high inflation and decline in GDP per capita in
recent years have taken a toll. [If a majority of Quebecers voted for
sovereignty in a third referendum, would the rest of Canada stay
together?]{.underline} Probably, but [the **risks of** a
**fragmentation** of Canada are growing.]{.underline}

[We should recognize our weakened national unity and work towards
improving key economic policies so that a united Canada appeals to all
Canadians]{.underline}. Many of our policy challenges require responses
from both federal and provincial governments. A coordinated approach to
solving these issues would not only uplift this country but also
demonstrate the value of federalism.

#### World War III.

Security, https://cimsec.org/quebec-wars/)

Thought of **[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[being the region
where]{.mark} the **sparks for [World War III will be struck]{.mark}**
may not seem likely, but there is one area where a foreign foe could
surprise the West: **Quebec**]{.underline}. [[If **Quebec were to
secede**]{.underline}]{.mark} from Canada, two unsettling possibilities
could occur. The first is that **[[Canada could go to
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** with its wayward province. The second is that
some power like [China or Russia could build an alliance]{.underline}
with Quebec. While such possibilities are unlikely, there are means of
defense.

The Canadian Civil War

If Quebec were to secede from Canada, there are several points that
could spark a civil war between the two. The least likely would be
national pride. [There are **several economic reasons** that could
provide the **tinder for war**. Quebec controls the mouth of the St.
Lawrence River, and Quebec could use that control to wage economic war
with Western Canada]{.underline}. In addition, [Quebec possesses
significant reserves of **natural resources** that currently contribute
to the North American economy on a free basis. An independent Quebec
would change that]{.underline}. Finally, Canada proper would become a
split country, with a third of Canadian provinces being geographically
separated from the Capital. In light of the fact that no state wants to
be divided, and Canada already has several fluttering independence
movements, [the urge to prevent further dissolution will be
strong.]{.underline}

While it is true that Canada does not have a large military, and Quebec
has none, [it is not impossible for war to break out.]{.underline} The
**[[Quebec separatists]{.underline}]{.mark}** [have [used violence
before,]{.mark}]{.underline} most notably with the murder of Quebec
Labour Minister Pierre Laporte, [and [it would be **easy**]{.mark} for a
semi-independent Quebec [to **buy arms**]{.mark} on the international
market.]{.underline}

If Canada did get involved in civil war with Quebec, there are several
options open to both sides if the war drags on. [[**Canada** could
invoke **Article 5**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the NATO treaty, [[which
could **split NATO** as **France**]{.mark} has]{.underline}
traditionally [**expressed [support]{.mark}** for Francophone
[Quebec]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is unlikely [Britain would
be]{.underline} un[**concerned** with a core Commonwealth state being
embroiled in civil war]{.underline}; especially depending on how the
vote for Scottish independence goes this year. [The
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would be
**committed**]{.underline}, [as they are deeply intertwined with Canada
at every level.]{.underline}

States like [[Russia, China, or Iran could **use the
distraction**]{.mark} **of a civil war**]{.underline} in the very center
of the Anglosphere [[to **press their boundaries**]{.mark} with the
Western Alliance.]{.underline} Furthermore, [[they could]{.mark} start
**[support]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} the **[Quebec
[rebels]{.mark}]{.underline}**, either directly or through third party
means. If the war was presaged by an internationally recognized
referendum, then Russia or China could take the position that they are
upholding international norms, and paint the Western states in a
negative light. [Attempts at arming the rebels or openly supporting them
would directly threaten the fundamental security of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [as [it would]{.mark} [provide
a **foothold**]{.mark} **on the continent** from which **hostile states
could threaten the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

The Bear and the Dragon in Quebec

While the first scenario of a successful Quebec independence movement
immediately descending into world war is unlikely, [the far more
dangerous one of an independent Quebec making allies with states hostile
to the West is possible. An **independent [Quebec]{.mark}**
[would]{.mark} have the full ability to [**make alliances** with
**foreign powers**]{.mark},]{.underline} and it is unlikely they would
be readily welcomed into NATO, NAFTA, or other treaties with the Western
powers. [Canada would put pressure on any attempts to allow Quebec a
seat at the table]{.underline}, and European countries would be wary of
admitting Quebec, as it could fuel separatist movements within their own
countries.

In addition, the United States would not want the possibility of Canada
dissolving, even if most of the providences would likely join the United
States. This method of amalgamation would be undesirable, if for no
other reason than there is no guarantee that each section of Canada
would join the US, and a unified Canada is better for the US than a
series of states on its northern border. [The **[dissolution]{.mark} of
Canada** [could]{.mark}]{.underline} also **[[embolden separatist
movements in the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

[Given the]{.underline} internal [danger to Western
countries]{.underline} an independent Quebec would present, it is likely
that [[Quebec would]{.mark} be forced to **[look for friends
elsewhere]{.mark}**. **Russia** and **China** are the **most likely**
candidates. **Both**]{.underline} countries [would be interested
in]{.underline} the **[natural resources]{.underline}** of Quebec.
[China and Russia would also both enjoy the prospects of helping to
develop Quebec's Arctic resources]{.underline}. In addition, the
possibility of a military alliance with Quebec would present an
opportunity not present since Alaska became part of the United States; a
land connection to the United States.

Right now the Anglosphere is protected by its island status, with no
major hostile powers sharing a land border with any member. An
independent Quebec would be courted by hostile powers to allow such a
chance thought. [[Russia would **view it as
retal**]{.underline}]{.mark}iation [[for]{.mark} NATO **expanding into
the Baltics**]{.underline}, Poland, [and]{.underline} developing close
relations with **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Georgia.
[[**China** would]{.mark} view it as a chance to have a
**[mirror]{.mark}** for [the]{.mark} US alliances in China's **[First
Island Chain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with the added bonus of a large
land connection to the American heartland, as opposed to the slender one
that the US has against China on the Korean peninsula. [The presence of
a near-peer competitor with [**bases** on]{.mark} the **[North
America]{.mark}**n heartland would greatly **reduce the flexibility** of
Western countries]{.underline} as they exert their influence on the
world. Such a situation [[would be **more
bothersome**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the United States and its allies
[[than]{.mark} the **[Zimmerman]{.mark} telegram**]{.underline} of a
century ago, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the presence of **[Soviet
missiles in [Cuba]{.mark}]{.underline}** half a century ago. [It would
have the same effect as Germany's race to rival Britain on the high seas
before World War I.]{.underline}

[[Real GDP grew at 2.6%]{.underline}]{.mark} annualized [during the
fourth quarter]{.underline}, following a 2.2% growth in the third.
Full-year GDP growth was 1.5%, not different than in 2023 but with an
encouraging quarterly profile\--one of increasing growth momentum
(opposite of 2023).

[[Households led the way]{.mark} with the growth surprise]{.underline}.
[[Business outlays]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[showed
improvement]{.mark}, together with]{.underline} the
[unemployment]{.underline} rate stabilizing and then dropping to 6.6% in
February from its 6.9% peak in November. February employment gains came
in weaker (a muted 1,100 rise), but that was partly due to unseasonably
severe winter during the survey reference week. Statistics Canada noted
that the heavy snowstorms across the country contributed to a steep 1.3%
month-over-month decline in hours worked. Home sales and industrial
activity both picked up in the second half of the year. The [passthrough
from the lower interest rates turned out to be larger and faster than we
had assumed.]{.underline}

[Temporary fiscal stimulus, in the form of sales tax holiday and some
front-loading of exports ahead of U.S. tariffs, appear to have given the
first-quarter growth a boost]{.underline}. We expect first-quarter
growth to be near 1.5% annualized after accounting for retail sales
hiccup in February.

That said, just as economic activity had started to gain momentum, [[the
U.S.\'s]{.mark} shifting [trade policy mix is altering the]{.mark}
economic [outlook for Canada]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We
expect]{.underline} the [uncertainty on the trade front to weigh on
consumer and business sentiments]{.underline} as well as on spending,
with quarterly annualized growth averaging 1.2% for the rest of the
three quarters of 2025. Exports, a major part of the Canadian economy,
also suffer not only because of tariffs but also due to a weaker U.S.
growth (now expected to decelerate to 1.6% by the end of 2025). [This
would bring Canada\'s]{.underline} fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter
[growth]{.underline} in 2025 [to 1.3%]{.underline}, which is more than a
1 percentage point short of 2024\'s economic expansion.

The reason [[our macro forecast is **not**]{.mark} **as [bad]{.mark}**
as the consensus is [because]{.mark} [of our assumptions for
**tariffs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Our assumptions for [tariffs on
goods]{.mark}, excluding energy, [are smaller than]{.mark} the
[25%]{.mark} announced by the Trump administration]{.underline} (and
given a reprieve until April 2 for goods covered by USMCA, which account
for more than 50% of Canadian exports to the U.S.). The reason behind
such assumptions is [[to]{.mark} strike a **[balance]{.mark}** between
[the risk]{.mark} that tariffs are **[negotiated down
swiftly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with the risk that the rates stay high
and last longer. Additionally, we have opted to wait and see how the
\"reciprocal tariff\" announcement by the Trump administration scheduled
to come on, or after, April 2 treats the Canadian trade relation. After
all, [[Canada\'s]{.mark} [trade surplus is less than 1% of GDP]{.mark},
**[once energy is excluded]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the tariff
differentials by our calculations using the 2023 data is barely positive
(+0.11 percentage points) in favor of Canadian imports from the U.S. At
a HS-6 digit product basis, the weighted average tariffs on Canadian
imports from the U.S. is 2.03%, while U.S .imports from Canada are
1.92%.

Chart 3

[Our forecast assumes [the U.S.]{.mark} applying a]{.underline} 10%
weighted average [[tariff]{.underline}]{.mark} rate [on imports from
Canada]{.underline} (including 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel), most
of [which [will be **ramped down** in]{.mark} 20[26

tariffs by the U.S. remain at 25%.

In our baseline, [**[growth picks up]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
20**[26]{.mark}** as tariffs [are negotiated away and CUSMA is
**re-ratified**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Bank of
Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has been leading other major

to 2%]{.underline} by the end of 2025 to stop deterioration in the
unemployment rate and keeps the interest rate at the low end of its
estimated neutral 2.25%-2.75% target through 2026. [[It errs on the side

The same rate cuts will work to provide tailwind for catch-up growth in
2026. The unemployment rate peaks in the fourth quarter of this year at
7.0%, and falls to 6.5% in 2026 and 6.0% in 2027.

#### Diversification's on track.

Diversification Away From Oil,\" OilPrice,
https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Alberta-Seeks-Diversification-Away-From-Oil.html)

[[Alberta is seeking]{.mark} ways [to improve the return]{.mark} rates
[of its wealth fund and boost its size]{.mark}
considerably]{.underline}, from about C\$24.3 billion now to some C\$250
billion, or \$173 billion, Bloomberg has reported.

[[The purpose]{.underline}]{.mark}, per the report, [[is
**reducing**]{.mark} **the province's [dependence on oil and gas]{.mark}
revenues** because this dependence makes Alberta]{.underline}
"[susceptible to the highs and lows of global energy
markets,]{.underline} which can change rapidly and unpredictably,"
according to the provincial government.

To that end, [[the government]{.underline}]{.mark} of Alberta [[has set
up a]{.mark} new corporation to manage the **[wealth fund]{.mark}** and
seek new investment opportunities that would boost returns]{.underline}.
Per brand new legislation, [[the fund will]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[reinvest all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of its [**[returns]{.mark}**
instead of distributing them to the province.]{.underline}

"[When the royalties dry up]{.underline} or start to become
significantly smaller, [the only tool a government has is to seek more
revenue through the tax base]{.underline}," Alberta Finance Minister
Nate Horner told Bloomberg in an interview.

"[[By]{.mark} being diligent and **[allowing this to
grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}, by the time we get to C\$250 billion,
[[we'll have the ability to use this]{.mark} in an annual way
[to]{.mark} help **[offset revenue needs]{.mark}** within
government]{.underline}."

[Alberta receives over a quarter of its revenues from]{.underline} the
[oil and gas]{.underline} industry, with the total amount for this
budget year estimated at some C\$20.3 billion, or around \$14 billion.
That appears to be an uncomfortably high degree of dependence on oil and
gas revenues for the provincial government.

[The Alberta Heritage **Savings Trust Fund** currently has an annual
rate of return of 7%, which is not too shabby]{.underline} at all, but
the government of the province wants to boost this to 9% by 2050. For
context, as provided by Bloomberg, Norway's sovereign wealth fund has an
annual return rate of 6.3%, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority---the
UAE's sovereign wealth fund---has returned an average of 6.8% over the
past 30 years.

### UQ\-\--Canada Oil\-\--2NC

#### The US will continue guzzling Canadian oil.

**Slav 24**, writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience

Stands To Profit From Trump\'s Energy Agenda,\" OilPrice,
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadian-Oil-Stands-To-Profit-From-Trumps-Energy-Agenda.html)

Donald Trump's victory in last week's elections has worried many people.
The reason they are worried is the word tariffs. Trump has threatened to
impose tariffs on every country he sees as having an unfair trade
advantage over the United States. One country is lucky, however. That
county really does have an advantage---and tariffs will not erase this
advantage.

[[Canada is the biggest]{.mark} foreign [supplier of crude oil to U.S.
refiners]{.mark}. [Canadian supply is]{.mark}]{.underline} [especially
[vital in **heavy crude**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which U.S.]{.mark} oil
[companies do not produce]{.mark} **[anywhere near the necessary
volumes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
[refineries]{.underline} along the Gulf Coast. [[American crude is
**light**]{.mark} and sweet. A lot of [Canadian]{.mark} crude [is
**heavy**]{.mark} and sour. And **U.S. [refiners need both---at low
prices]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"[[We import a **lot of energy** from Canada]{.mark}. I can't imagine
that the president would want to tax that because all it would do would
be to raise our costs]{.underline} and not help anything with more
American jobs," former Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross told CBC this
week, "So I think [it's easy to have the fears be
overblown]{.underline}."

Indeed, per Bloomberg, [[Canada's]{.mark} energy exports to the United
States were worth close to \$160 billion]{.underline}---most of that in
the form of crude oil, refined products, and natural gas. A year later,
[crude [oil exports]{.mark} alone [hit a record]{.mark} of some 4
million barrels daily]{.underline}. Of those, **[[97% went to the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Canada Energy Regulator reported in
August. All that because the U.S. may be the biggest producer of crude
oil but it does not produce the full variety of grades that its
refineries need in order to churn out petroleum products.

[It is]{.underline} a **[symbiotic]{.underline}** relationship, really.
[Canada has all this heavy crude and a neighbor that needs all the heavy
crude it can get its hands on, especially after it
sanctioned]{.underline} the other two big heavy crude producers:
[Venezuela and Russia]{.underline}. The United States has all these
refineries configured to work with light and heavy crude, and a neighbor
with some of the biggest oil sands reserves in the world. That neighbor
has been eager to diversify its export outlets, but it mainly has
increased shipments south of the border.

Spring 2024 in Canada marked a historic moment. The Trans Mountain
pipeline put into operation its expanded capacity of close to 900,000
barrels daily. That's up from just 300,000 bpd, meaning the Trans
Mountain can now carry three times what it could carry previously.
Numerous attempts were made to cancel the project, but in the end,
demand for energy won and TXM was completed---and thanks to that,
Canadian oil exports to the United States broke their record this year,
hitting 4.3 million barrels daily in July, per U.S. Energy Information
Administration data.

[[U.S. refiners need Canadian crude and have nothing to replace it
with]{.mark}, **not in the necessary volumes**]{.underline}. [Even if
some future U.S. administration decides to lift all sanctions from
Venezuela and Russia, [Canadian]{.mark} heavy [crude will likely
remain]{.mark} the **cheapest**, most [convenient]{.mark} sort of heavy
crude for U.S. refiners. **[Unless]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Trudeau [[government]{.underline}]{.mark}
pushes its draconian emissions cap through and
**[[makes]{.underline}]{.mark}** local crude
**[[oil]{.underline}]{.mark}** production **[[a lot more
expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[**[Until this happens]{.mark}**, however, [Trump is unlikely to point
the tariff weapon north]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Tariffs]{.underline} only
work from a position of power. They [don't really work in a symbiotic
relationship where the partners need each other equally.]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--Trade Barrier Reduction\-\--2NC

#### New projects overcome tariffs 

**Canada 3-21** Mark Carney, the prime minster of Canada and the
Canadian government (United, 3-21-2025, \"Prime Minister Carney meets
with premiers and shares his plan to build one strong Canadian
economy\", Prime Minister of Canada,
https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2025/03/21/prime-minister-carney-meets-premiers-and-shares-his-plan-build)

Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, met with provincial and
territorial premiers and shared his plan to build one strong Canadian
economy.

[The trade war brought on by the United States has renewed the urgency
to address longstanding barriers]{.underline} that have fragmented our
economy and reduced opportunities for Canadians. At the top of the
agenda, the Prime Minister updated premiers on the Government of
Canada's actions to support workers and businesses affected by tariffs.

To support workers, the new government will:

- Temporarily waive the one-week employment insurance (EI) waiting
  period.

- Suspend rules around separation for a six-month period, so workers
  don't have to exhaust severance pay before collecting EI.

- Make it easier to access EI by increasing regional unemployment rate
  percentages.

To support businesses, the new government will:

- Defer corporate income tax payments and GST/HST remittances from April
  2 to June 30, 2025, providing up to \$40 billion in liquidity to
  businesses.

- Deploy a new financing facility for businesses.

- Provide more funding to Canada's regional development agencies, so
  they can better support businesses.

[The [Prime Minister and the premiers agreed that by]{.mark} working
together to unlock [economic projects and remove barriers]{.mark},
[Canada can more than offset the effects of U.S.
tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[creating]{.mark} higher-paying jobs,
maximizing our economic potential, and becoming stronger at home and
stronger abroad]{.underline}.

To that end, Prime Minister Carney outlined a suite of measures to
develop a national trade and economic corridor. This [corridor will
drive [investment]{.mark}, create [jobs, and]{.mark} build [economic
growth. It will include]{.mark}:]{.underline}

- [[The creation of a First Mile Fund]{.underline}]{.mark}, building
  transportation networks to connect energy extraction sites to rail
  lines and roads. [By providing capital to finance these key
  infrastructure projects across the country, the Government of Canada
  will expedite project construction and create a more integrated and
  accessible Canadian economy.]{.underline}

- A "one window" approval process, [[streamlining approvals for
  large-scale, national-interest infrastructure
  projects]{.underline}]{.mark}. This new measure will create clear,
  predictable, and efficient review processes -- with the highest
  standards for safety, environmental protection, and Indigenous
  consultation -- and reduce uncertainty for investors.

- A contribution agreement of [[up to \$200 million toward the
  construction]{.mark}, commissioning, and operation of a new Indigenous
  majority-owned Cedar LNG processing facility]{.underline}. A
  partnership between the Haisla Nation and the Pembina Pipeline
  Corporation, [this project will create hundreds of highly skilled
  construction and trades jobs, [generate over \$275 million in economic
  growth]{.mark}]{.underline}, and get Canadian energy to domestic and
  international markets.

- [[A \$175 million investment]{.mark} in the Hudson Bay Railway and at
  the Port of Churchill, in Manitoba]{.underline}. [This critical
  investment [in Canadian trade and railway infrastructure]{.mark} will
  expand and open new transportation corridors, bolster economic growth
  and reconciliation in the Canadian Arctic and North, and help get
  Canadian products to global markets.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, [Prime Minister]{.mark} Carney stressed the imperative to
break down barriers to interprovincial trade. To build a stronger and
fairer economy, he [committed]{.mark} to table legislation by July 1,
2025, [to eliminate all federal barriers to interprovincial trade and
labour mobility]{.mark} and to remove all federal exemptions under the
Canada Free Trade Agreement.]{.underline}

[By harmonizing regulations and enhancing labour mobility, Canada can
create a truly open Canadian market]{.underline} -- one that reduces
costs for its businesses and consumers alike. This will help strengthen
supply chains, boost productivity, and unlock new opportunities for
Canadian companies.

#### Canda removes trade barriers to offset tariffs 

**Canada International Affairs 2-20**-2025 it's the Canadian
government... (Intergovernmental Affairs, 2-20-2025, \"Government of
Canada removing more than half of federal exceptions to the Canadian
Free Trade Agreement to strengthen Interprovincial Trade\", No
Publication,

Ottawa, Ontario, February 21, 2025 **-- **Today, the Honourable Anita
Anand, [Minister of Transport and Internal Trade, announced [the
upcoming removal of an additional 20 federal exceptions in the]{.mark}
Canadian Free Trade Agreement ([CFTA]{.mark}), [reduc]{.mark}ing [the
number of federal exceptions from 39 to 19]{.mark}. The majority of
exceptions removed relate to government procurement, [providing Canadian
businesses greater opportunity to compete across the
country]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This action builds on the federal government's demonstrated leadership
in strengthening commitments under the CFTA. In July 2024,
the [Government of Canada
announced](https://www.canada.ca/en/intergovernmental-affairs/news/2024/07/the-government-of-canada-is-making-it-easier-to-trade-within-canada.html) the
removal or narrowing of 17 of its CFTA exceptions. Together, these
[[successive reviews represent the removal of 64% of the]{.mark}
Government of Canada's [exceptions]{.mark} in the Agreement since it
launched in 2017.]{.underline}

[[The removal of these barriers comes at a critical time, as Canada
positions]{.mark} our [domestic economy to respond to]{.mark} the threat
of [tariffs]{.mark} from the United States]{.underline}. [[Eliminating
barriers]{.mark} to internal trade [will reduce business costs, increase
productivity, and potentially add up to \$200 billion to the Canadian
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It's more important than ever that we work together at all levels --
federal, provincial, territorial -- to reduce the burden on businesses
in Canada. That's why the Government of Canada is encouraging all
provinces and territories to take similar steps to reduce their own
exceptions under the CFTA.

The Government of Canada will continue to build on these successes and
collaborate with provinces and territories to accelerate efforts to
enhance internal trade and labour mobility across the country. 

### UQ\-\--AT: Tariffs Thump Growth\-\--2NC

#### Tariffs are a neg arg\-\--Canada was [exempted]{.underline}, giving it a [new comparative advantage]{.underline} 

**Rendell 4-3**-2025, economics reporters. Citing Chamber of Commerce
president Candace Laing (\*Mark and \*\*Nojoud Al Mallees, \"Canada,
Mexico spared from worst of Trump's latest tariff blitz,\" Globe and
Mail,
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/economy/article-canada-mexico-spared-from-worst-of-trumps-latest-tariff-blitz/)

[While]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} took a
sledgehammer to the global trading system]{.underline} on Wednesday, [he
[offered a **reprieve to Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline} and Mexico,
potentially **[[putting]{.mark} his [neighbours at a competitive
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}** if they stay within the bounds of the
continental trade agreement.

In his most sweeping protectionist measures yet, Mr. Trump placed a
10-per-cent baseline tariff on imports into the U.S., with considerably
higher tariffs on dozens of trading partners including the European
Union, China and Japan.

**[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Mexico, however, **[[will not face
the baseline tariff or]{.mark} a higher [country-specific
duty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Both remain subject to the
across-the-board tariffs imposed in early March]{.underline}, ostensibly
to force Ottawa and Mexico City to address border security problems.
[However, [goods that comply with]{.mark}]{.underline} the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (**[[USMCA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) will
**[[remain exempt]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

That means a significant portion of
[**[Canad]{.mark}**i**[a]{.mark}**n]{.underline} and Mexican [goods
[will continue to trade **tariff-free**]{.mark}, while other countries
face a steep jump in duties. In effect, Mr. [Trump is forcing
**more**]{.mark}]{.underline} North American
**[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to happen under]{.mark} the auspices
of the **[USMCA]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while making it prohibitively
expensive for companies to export non-compliant goods to the U.S.

Globe economics reporter Mark Rendell says Wednesday's tariff
announcement by President Donald Trump saw Canada not hit as hard as
predicted, but that the trade war has now gone global.

CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in an e-mail that Canada
appears to have gotten off lighter than expected, but that remaining
tariffs on aluminum and steel as well as vehicles and auto parts are
still "very problematic."

According to economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank, the effective tariff
rate Canada now faces from the U.S. is roughly 10 per cent, up from less
than 2 per cent before Mr. Trump took office. CIBC economists,
meanwhile, estimate the average effective tariff rate could be 5 per
cent if all goods become compliant with the USMCA.

Nevertheless, [Canadian **[business groups]{.mark}** on Wednesday
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} tepidly **[[optimistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that Mr. [Trump's decision to leave out Canada and Mexico from
reciprocal tariffs means any trade-related disputes can be punted off to
the renegotiation of the USMCA]{.underline}. The agreement is up for a
review in July, 2026, though politicians may push for negotiations
sooner.

"We hope that today's positioning regarding Canada by the U.S. is part
of a path to real negotiation, ultimately leading to long-term
partnership focused on continental economic security and resilience,"
said Chamber of Commerce president Candace Laing in a statement.

There's also some hope that [[border]{.mark}-related [tariffs]{.mark}
imposed on Canada and Mexico [may be **lifted**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The executive order issued on Wednesday notes that if those levies are
removed, a 12-per-cent tariff would apply to goods that are not
compliant of the USMCA -- less than half of existing the 25-per-cent
rate.

"It suggests to me that **[there is a path forward here]{.underline}**.
It's not straight line. It'll require a lot of effort. But all in all[,
I would say [it **wasn't a bad day for Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Business Council of Canada president Goldy Hyder told The Globe and
Mail.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump's new global
tariffs "are going to fundamentally change the international trading
system" but that the U.S. President "has preserved a number of important
elements of our trading relationship."

How that change in the international trading system will affect Canada
is still unclear, as economists see both opportunity and risk.

Mr. Shenfeld said that the higher-than-expected global tariffs "could
push up inflation and hit confidence south of the border, which can also
dent Canada's export volumes. So, there's still work for Canada's
incoming government to try to get to the negotiating table and see if we
can reach a mutually beneficial deal with the U.S."

At the same time, some [[Canadian exporters may **benefit relative to
their competitors**]{.mark} in other countries now facing steep
tariffs.]{.underline}

#### Trump didn't actually impose any tariffs on Canada!

**Gowling 4-2**-2025, journalist (Jordan, \"Canada escapes new levies as
Trump imposes sweeping reciprocal tariffs,\" financialpost,
https://financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-announces-reciprocal-tariffs)

United States President Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[announced]{.underline} sweeping [reciprocal tariffs]{.underline}
against U.S. trading partners on Wednesday, [but [**did not apply an
additional levy** on Canada.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"This is one of the most important days in my opinion, in American
history," Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. "It's our
declaration of economic independence."

During a sprawling press conference, Trump railed against countries he
alleged have blocked U.S. access to their markets, stolen intellectual
property and imposed "exorbitant" taxes on U.S. firms.

He then read from a chart that listed reciprocal tariff rates the U.S.
was imposing on many countries, with tariffs ranging as high as 49 per
cent set to take effect on April 9. Significant trading partners on the
list included China, which will be hit with a 34 per cent tariff, and
the European Union, which is facing a 20 per cent tariff. According to
an executive order signed by the president, all U.S. trading partners
will be subject to a baseline 10 per cent tariff as of April 5.

**[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [**[was not on the
list]{.mark}**, and [the ex]{.mark}]{.underline}ecutive
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}rder later **[[confirmed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that [[it would not face]{.mark} additional
[tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Rather]{.underline}, [[the
existing]{.mark} tariff [regime]{.mark}, [which **exempts** goods
covered by]{.mark}]{.underline} the Canada-United-States-Mexico
Agreement (**[[CUSMA]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[will remain]{.mark} in
place.]{.underline}

The exemption on CUSMA goods and tariffs of 25 per cent on non-CUSMA
goods and 10 per cent on non-CUSMA energy and potash "are unaffected by
this order," a White House fact sheet said.

The long-awaited rollout of the new U.S. tariff policy, an occasion

finally hit on Wednesday.

After bracing for the worst, some **[[industry leaders are]{.mark}

remain]{.underline}, while a levy on Canadian automobiles went into
effect as of midnight on Wednesday. As well, tariffs on goods that
don\'t comply with the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA),
which was negotiated in 2018, are still in place.

Adam Legge, president of the Business Council of Alberta, noted that
[[Canada]{.mark} seemed to [**dodge** the **worst-case
scenario**]{.mark} that some feared]{.underline}, at least for now.

\"For now, [[we\'re]{.mark} actually **[optimistic]{.mark}** that [we
are not in the same scenario we thought we were]{.mark} January 20, and
then February 2 and then March 4]{.underline},\" Legge said, referring
to previous U.S. tariff deadlines that had loomed over Canada.

[Some [industries, like]{.mark} the **[energy]{.mark}**
sector]{.underline}, [[are **already**]{.mark} largely
**[CUSMA-compliant]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Legge said. And [[tariff
threats]{.mark} have [encouraged more businesses to fill out]{.mark} the
necessary [paperwork to become compliant]{.mark} with the free trade

[[Americans are not going to want to see their allies **turned into

[Ottawa has **recent experience**, from]{.underline} the

As Americans get a sense of how our measures can affect their economy, a
side effect of the trade war will be that we will be taken for granted
less by the megapower. This current crisis is putting more focus on
Canada south of the border than anything else I can remember.

#### He won't follow through.

[Higher fuel prices could be in the cards if]{.underline}
President-elect Donald [Trump follows through with his tariff threats on
Canada]{.underline}, according to [industry
[experts]{.mark}]{.underline}, who [[are **skeptical**]{.mark} on
[whether the]{.mark} new [levies will **ever be
implemented**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Trump on Monday pledged to implement additional tariffs on China, Canada
and Mexico on day one of his presidency, according to his posts on
social media platform Truth Social. He said he would sign an executive
order on Jan. 20 imposing a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and
Mexico, a move that may breach the terms of a regional free trade
agreement.

Goldman Sachs' Co-Head of Global Commodities Research Daan Struyven said
that if a 25% levy hit Canadian crude exports to the U.S. "that could,
in theory, lead to some pretty significant consequences for three
groups."

[[U.S. refiners who rely on Canadian oil]{.mark} barrels [could face
lower profit]{.mark} margins, [and consumers may]{.mark} potentially
[face higher prices]{.mark}]{.underline}, surmised Struyven. Lastly,
Canadian producers may suffer revenue losses if they are unable to
reroute their barrels that would have otherwise gone to the U.S.

America's imports of Canadian crude oil hit a record of 4.3 million
barrels per day in July 2024 after the expansion of Canada's Trans
Mountain pipeline, according to the most recent data from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration.

Additionally, [[refiners]{.mark} in the Midwest]{.underline}, [[which
are]{.mark} more [adapted to process Canada's heavy]{.mark}]{.underline}
sour [[crude]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than the low sulfur sweet crude
produced domestically, [[could]{.mark} also [have problems
switching]{.mark} should the Canadian imports be
interrupted]{.underline}, Struyven told journalists at an online
conference.

"If we were to see a 25% tariff on Canadian energy exports, I think it
could have some very significant ramifications for trade flows,"
Struyven said.

[Mexico and especially Canada have "notable tightly integrated linkages"
with the U.S. when it comes to]{.underline} the [oil]{.underline},
natural gas and auto industries, Citigroup wrote in a note following
Trump's announcements this week.

"Absent carve-outs, this would increase costs for U.S. refiners and U.S.
consumers," said the bank's research team led by Energy Strategist Eric
Lee.

However, Goldman highlighted that [it is **unlikely** that the tariffs
will be **implemented as announced**]{.underline}, [on the
premise]{.underline} that the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[is focused on reducing energy
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Trump **cannot allow inflation to get out of control**]{.mark} in the
15 months [before the midterm]{.mark} election season]{.underline},
Viktor Shvets, global strategist at Macquarie Capital, told CNBC. Shvets
believes that [[tariffs are]{.underline}]{.mark} used as [[a
**negotiating tool**]{.mark} to achieve certain objectives such as
strengthening the border.]{.underline}

"[[I **do not believe for a second**]{.mark} that [there will be a
**massive increase** in]{.mark} overall [tariffs because that will
represent a tax on]{.mark} U.S. domestic
[manufacturers]{.mark}]{.underline}. That will also represent a tax on
U.S. exporters," said Shvets.

### UQ\-\--AT: Canada Decarb Inevitable\-\--2NC

#### Oil growth is compatible with Canada's nominal climate targets because [exports don't count against the total]{.underline}

**McKibben 23**, founder of 350.org, an international environmental
organization. His is the author of more than a dozen books about the
environment, including Oil and Honey: The Education of an Unlikely
Activist. (Bill, 11-21-2023, \"Canada and other oil-rich countries don't
count emissions from fossil fuel exports. Let's fix that,\" Narwhal,
https://thenarwhal.ca/opinion-cop28-oil-gas-exports/)

When the world convenes in the United Arab Emirates later this month for
the next round of the endless climate slog, [much [attention]{.mark}
[will be paid to the pledges of individual nations to cut their
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has been the basic scorecard of
climate talks almost since the start. But **[[it's a wildly incomplete
scorecard]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in ways that are becoming ever clearer
as we enter the endgame of the energy transition. We've been measuring
it wrong.

That's **[[because]{.mark} a country's [exports of fossil fuel don't
count against its tot]{.mark}al]{.underline}**. [But it's those exports
that are driving fossil fuel expansion around the world]{.underline},
coming as they do from some of the most diplomatically powerful and
wealthy nations on Earth.

To give the most obvious, and largest, example: the United States is,
fitfully, cutting back on its carbon emissions; its envoys will be able
to report, honestly, that the Inflation Reduction Act should soon
actually be trimming our domestic use of oil, gas and coal, as we
subsidize heat pumps and build out electric-vehicle charging networks.
But at the very same moment, the U.S. production of fossil fuels is
booming. That means, of course, that much of that supply is headed
overseas.

And the numbers are truly staggering. If the liquefied natural gas (LNG)
buildout continues as planned, for instance, by 2030 U.S. LNG exports
will be responsible for more greenhouse gases than every house, car and
factory in the European Union. The emissions, under the United Nations
accounting system, will show up on the scorecards of the European Union
and the dozens of mostly Asian nations that will buy the gas. But if you
could see them in the atmosphere, they would be red, white and blue.

Countries like Canada and the U.S. are exporting massive quantities of
oil and gas, along with its respective greenhouse gases --- meaning
their national emissions counts continue to fall. Photo: Amber Bracken /
The Narwhal

Exactly the same thing is true of a handful of other nations --- in
fact, some are even more grotesque in their hypocrisy, if not their
impact. **[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has]{.underline}, arguably,
[done as good a job as any]{.underline} country on Earth [on
**[mov]{.mark}**ing [past oil]{.mark} and gas; almost every new car in
the country runs on electricity. [But it's planning one of the dozen
biggest expansions in]{.mark} national [oil]{.mark}]{.underline} and gas
[production]{.underline}, [almost all of it [for
**export**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
Australia **[[fall into the same basket]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed,
a remarkable new report from Oil Change International found those four
countries (the U.S., Canada, Australia and Norway), along with the
United Kingdom, account for just over half of the planned expansion in
oil and gas between now and mid-century. In most cases the [project
licences have already been granted]{.underline} and unless officials
intervene, the damage (enough carbon and methane to take us past the
Paris climate targets) is locked in.

But this means **[[if other nations]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the
climate movement could figure out how to **[[pressure these
countries]{.mark} to turn the spigot]{.underline}** to the right, **[[we
could staunch]{.mark} much of [this]{.mark}]{.underline}** flow of
greenhouse gases into the air. If five countries account for half the
expansion problem --- and if those five countries are rich and have
diversified economies that allow them freedom of choice about their
futures --- then some of the main targets are clear. All of them,
remember, have made the right noises about the need for urgent climate
action; they just haven't been willing to face down their exporters.

[[Canada continues to approve]{.underline}]{.mark} and/or subsidize
**[[new pipelines]{.underline}]{.mark}** and LNG export projects,
[[while permitting new oil]{.underline}]{.mark} and gas [[fields,
putting it on track to become the]{.mark} world's [second-largest
producer]{.mark} of oil]{.underline} and gas. Australia, the world's
third-largest fossil fuel exporter, has given the green light to major
new coal and gas projects. Norway, Europe's largest oil and gas
producer, has awarded 47 new licences for oil and gas projects in the
Norwegian Sea and is permitting expansion into the Barents Sea in the
Arctic. And the current Conservative government in the United Kingdom
has adopted a policy to "max out" fossil fuel development in the North
Sea.

### UQ\-\--AT: Trump Drilling\-\--2NC

#### Drill baby drill is a slogan, not a strategy. Hard constraints limit growth. 

**Miller 2-7**-2025, energy journalist. (Sarah, \"Trump's Non-Transition
--- to Nowhere,\" Medium,
https://medium.com/the-new-climate/trumps-non-transition-to-nowhere-2a64a513f37a)

Domestic Difficulties

Even if it fails to disrupt the transition at a global level, [what
might Trump's energy approach do at home to bolster US oil and gas
companies]{.underline} and weaken their clean-energy counterparts? First
hints arrived on Day 1 with declaration of a "National Energy
Emergency." Wide-ranging as it sounds, this amounts mainly to a
declaration of war on the Endangered Species Act, to be fought on the
heavily Democratic West Coast and US Northeast.

In a world threatened by mass species extinction, that could be a big,
destructive deal. But it's of little use to an oil and gas industry
that's not in buildout mode in those states n or much wishes to be.

[The regulatory shortcuts Trump's declaration outlines could more
feasibly help utility-scale solar or onshore wind]{.underline} ---
although renewables don't appear in a list of energy sources coved by
the declaration, so it's hard to say. What is mentioned in Trump
pronouncements that might be useful to solar developers --- albeit
harmful to plant and animal life --- is mining of rare Earth and other
"non-fuel minerals," necessary inputs for making solar components, as
well as microchips.

As far as oil and gas production levels go, though --- the point of that
"**[[drill, baby, drill]{.underline}]{.mark}**" stuff --- all this
[[is]{.mark} merely [a **distraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Trump is
removing constraints]{.mark} on access to oil and gas]{.underline}
resources [[on]{.mark} federal [lands that **don't contain
much**]{.mark} desirable **[oil and gas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The
Permian Basin]{.underline}]{.mark} in Texas and Oklahoma
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the offshore [[Gulf]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Mexico are [where the most profitable oil and gas deposits are, and
state and federal regulators]{.underline} alike [[have **always**
kept]{.mark} access in those places **wide [open]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Forecasts show a **slowdown**]{.underline} ahead after years of rapid
growth [in US production of both oil and gas]{.underline}. Not because
of government policies, but because [[the]{.mark} lowest-cost, [most
profitable reserves have **been developed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
the hefty dividends and other payouts oil companies use to buy investor
affection rule out throwing money at less profitable
prospects.]{.underline}

[[What the oil companies]{.mark} **[want more than anything]{.mark}** at
this stage [is **high prices**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- **[exactly what
Trump does not want]{.underline}**. Culturally, Trump and the oil
industry may be a good fit. [In practical business terms, they're often
at odds.]{.underline}

The two Trump energy pronouncements so far that do have a solidly
helpful feel about them from an oil industry perspective are
near-automatic licensing of LNG export facilities and withdrawal of
support for EVs. But [**[LNG]{.mark}** licenses will help only to the
extent that somebody wants to buy American LNG for decades into the
future, [and it's hard to see who]{.mark} those [customers will be
as]{.mark} the rest of [the world **moves**]{.mark} **increasingly** [to
**solar and wind**]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- [and the US looks **less
reliable** as a trading partner]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If [Trump]{.underline} can't or won't do all that much to help oil and
gas, what might he do to hurt renewable power generation? He [can kill
off big floating [offshore wind]{.mark} generation]{.underline}, that is
mostly in federal waters and requires federal licensing. That's a big
setback for the transition plans of a few Democratic states. The four
offshore projects already in operation will stay. But [virtually all the
vulnerable ones under development are in heavily Democratic
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York, or the swing state of
Virginia and neighboring Maryland, and **they [are going
nowhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Disrupting Democratic state plans makes
it more fun for Trump. But [high and continuously rising costs have
recently cast a pall over this sector worldwide, so it's unclear how
much practical difference it makes.]{.underline}

[The Republican strongholds of Texas and Florida are coastal
states]{.underline}, too, and might theoretically have gone for deep
offshore wind. [But they have cheaper alternatives]{.underline}. "Texas
is dominating the development of renewable energy generation and battery
storage within the US, and is estimated to have installed nearly 80%
more combined solar, wind and battery capacity than the next largest
state" at end-2024, wrote Reuters energy commentator Gavin McGuire in
January. The №2 state is California --- often assumed to be the US
renewables leader --- while Florida is №3.

The reasons Texas has pulled ahead of California are many, but one big
result is to complicate any move by Trump against ongoing expansion of
solar, onshore wind, and battery storage. [Texas's turn towards
renewables is **clear indication** that solar and wind reduce power
costs and increase reliability,]{.underline} since Texas is also the
biggest shale-gas producing state. It's not nearly as much fun or easy
for Trump to disrupt transition Texas and Florida as it is in New York
and Massachusetts.

All of which demonstrates the obstacles Trump faces in favoring natural
gas over renewable power generation. For oil, the issues are different
but also complex in both practical and political terms.

Trump has halted federal funding of EV charging stations and set the
wheels in motion to flatline auto efficiency standards. This should
provide a fillip for US gasoline demand, which has for years been in
decline. That's good news for US oil refiners and marketers. For
international players like Exxon and Chevron, though, the benefits have
to be balanced against potential damage from Trump's repeated hammering
on Saudi Arabia to increase production and bring down global oil prices.
Crude oil prices are always critical for Big Oil, and could become
make-or-break if China pulls the world beyond peak oil demand.

[On top of this is the threat of lost business for US companies from
retaliatory tariffs China has already slapped on US oil and
LNG,]{.underline} an act other countries might copy if Trump keeps on
tossing tariff threats around.

Predicting Trump's moods and behavior is too foolhardy a task even for
me. The point is that, even if he sticks with the pro-oil, anti-clean
energy policies he's trotted out so far, and even if he decides to
ignore his love of American factories and cut off Biden-era funding for
new solar, battery, and EV plants --- which I don't think he will ---
[[success in selling more oil and gas]{.mark} and killing off renewables
[is]{.mark} not guaranteed. Arguably **[not even
likely]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Oil and Gas

Regarding oil and gas, **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [promised to
relax restrictions on oil and gas drilling permits]{.underline} and open
more federal land for oil and gas drilling. However, [this [will
**not**]{.mark} necessarily [**lead to more actual drilling**,
especially]{.mark} in the [short term]{.mark}. Oil
companies']{.underline} [**drilling plans** mainly **depend on market
conditions**]{.underline}. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told CNBC that "US
shale oil production does not face external constraints," and that "the
outcome of [the]{.underline} presidential [election]{.underline} ...
[won't affect oil production levels]{.underline} in the short to medium
term," explaining that "I don't see how 'drill baby drill' translates
into policy."50

[US [oil]{.mark} production [is already at record
highs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [oil [companies are unlikely to
increase production out of concern]{.mark} that [it would **hurt
prices**]{.mark} and profits]{.underline}.51 Moreover, Politico reported
that "[global oil [demand]{.mark} may **[already]{.mark}** have
**[started to peak]{.mark}**]{.underline}," so "[oil [companies]{.mark}
are already signalling that they [will pull back]{.mark} on drilling
next year [as]{.mark} crude oil [prices sag]{.mark}]{.underline}," [[and
they are worried]{.underline}]{.mark} that Trump's [[**tariffs** will
increase their costs and close foreign markets]{.mark} for]{.underline}
both [gas and oil]{.underline}.52 [Tariffs and trade wars would also
reduce]{.underline} economic [growth, which would also reduce oil
demand]{.underline}.53

[[**No companies submitted bids** on the Interior Department's oil and
gas lease sale]{.mark} of 400,000 acres]{.underline} in Alaska's Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge on 8 January 2025, which was required by a 2017
law passed during the first Trump administration. 54 The first attempted
auction at the end of the first Trump administration in 2021 attracted
only USD 14.4 million in bids, and Alaska's state-owned economic
development corporation was the only bidder, but the leases were ended
by the Biden administration.55

On 6 January 2025, President Biden announced a ban on offshore oil and
gas drilling in 625 million acres in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
based on the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.56 President Trump
expressed his intention to reverse the ban, but the law does not say
that the President can revoke the ban, so the courts are not likely to
allow the ban to be reversed without a new law passed by Congress.57

It is also not clear how hard Trump will try to reverse Biden's oil
drilling bans. Even during his first term, he recognized that offshore
oil drilling is not politically popular, and before the 2020
presidential election, he extended existing moratoriums on offshore
drilling from Florida to Virginia.58

Regarding natural gas, [the US became the world's largest natural gas
exporting country]{.underline} in 2023. The Biden administration's pause
on LNG export facilities affected about twelve projects which could have
increased export capacity by 10 billion cubic feet per day.59 The
climate implications depend on which energy sources are displaced by it
-- coal, nuclear, or renewable energy. The Trump administration is
likely to reverse this ban. However, [these [facilities **take a long
time** to construct]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [they are **not likely to
become functional**]{.mark} **[until 2030]{.mark}** when the market is
**already expected to experience a "glut"**]{.underline} of new
supplies,60 so the real impact is not yet clear. Moreover, the
[Biden]{.underline} administration['s]{.underline} [report
finding]{.underline} that [increasing US natural gas exports
would]{.underline} likely [increase domestic energy prices and displace
more renewable]{.underline} energy [projects than fossil
fuel]{.underline} project[s]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [strengthen
expected legal challenges]{.underline} to the Trump administration's
efforts to reverse the ban, [causing further delays]{.underline}.61

The importance of managing the lengthy transition to new energy sources

[There is an extensive lit]{.underline}erature [on the difficulty of
making the transition from one dominant energy source to
another]{.underline}, even when a lower cost for the new energy source
provides an incentive to make the shift. [We know this because nations
with advanced economies have made the transition to new primary energy
sources several times over the past two centuries]{.underline}, moving
from wood to coal to petroleum to natural gas (see Fouquet 2009, 11).
Canada has made similar transitions to new energy sources. These include
a "shift from reliance on wood, to coal, electricity (created first by
coal and then hydro and then nuclear energy), oil, and then natural gas"
(Sandwell 2016, 16). Today, [many foresee a shift from
fossil]{.underline} fuel[s]{.underline} [to renewable
energy]{.underline} sources such as solar, wind, nuclear, and hydro in
response to climate change.

[One lesson from past [energy transitions]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[is they [require **several decades**]{.mark} **to
complete**]{.underline}. [Coal is one example of how slowly these
transitions occur]{.underline}. [Coal provided]{.underline} just
[7]{.underline}.3 [percent of Canada's]{.underline} total [energy
consumption in 1871]{.underline}, [rising to]{.underline} 41 percent 30
years later in 1902, and then an all-time high of [66 percent in
1918]{.underline} (Watson 2016, 21). Even then, [the timeline during
which Canada embraced coal is relatively rapid for an energy
transition]{.underline}. After reviewing the changes in the world's
primary energy consumption, one researcher observed that
"**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Industrial Age **[[energy sources
follow a similar trend]{.underline}]{.mark}** when entering the market.
[[It takes]{.mark} 40 to **[50 years]{.mark}** for an energy source [to
go from 1% to 10%]{.mark} of market share, [and]{.mark} an energy source
that eventually comes to occupy **[half]{.mark}** of the market [will
take]{.mark} **almost [a century]{.mark}**]{.underline} to do so" (de
Sousa, quoted in Rhodes 2018, 339). Yergin summarized how "history
demonstrates that [energy transition **takes a long time**.]{.underline}
[It took almost a century before oil overtook coal as the number one
energy source]{.underline}" (2011, 715). Smil concludes that [a global
energy transition]{.underline} "[takes]{.underline} two or **[three
generations]{.underline}**, or 50--75 years, [for a new resource to
capture a large share]{.underline} of the energy market" (2017, 395).

[Energy transitions span decades because of]{.underline} what Yergin
calls "the law of **[long lead times]{.underline}**" (2011, 715). [One
reason]{.underline} for the long lead [is the time required to learn how
to make and use new energy sources]{.underline}. For example, gasoline
used in motor vehicles meant "filling stations need gasoline, gasoline
comes from oil, oil had to be discovered, refineries had to process it,
pipelines had to deliver the oil to the refineries and the gasoline to
the cities where the cars were driven" (Rhodes 2018, 339).

Most importantly, [energy transitions take time [because
of]{.mark}]{.underline} "[the **prerequisites** for [**enormous
infrastructure investment** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[inertia
of]{.mark} massively [embedded]{.mark} energy
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Smil 2017, 397). [[Energy systems
require]{.mark} **huge amounts of [capital]{.mark}**, often with life
spans of 60 years or more]{.underline} in the case of commercial
buildings, industrial and power plants, and residential homes. Building
a major new offshore oil platform or an oil sands plant requires a
decade or more. It takes five years to develop a new automobile and the
auto fleet turns over at a rate of only about 8 percent a year, implying
a total overhaul of the fleet needs two decades to complete (Yergin
2011, 715).

[Because of the considerable capital embedded in the existing energy
infrastructure built upon fossil fuels, weaning our society off fossil
fuels will be]{.underline} a **[much more difficult]{.underline}**
process [than many assume]{.underline}. [[Our energy-dependent
civilization involves]{.mark} a wide range of infrastructure,
including]{.underline} "[[mines]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[oil and gas
fields]{.underline}]{.mark}, thermal [[power
stations]{.underline}]{.mark}, hydroelectric

2017, 422). The reality is that [**[fossil]{.mark}** fuel[**s** will be
part of our econ]{.mark}omy [for **decades**]{.mark} to

### UQ\-\--AT: Tariffs Thump Oil\-\--2NC

#### Tariffs have only a [marginal effect]{.underline} on the US-Canada oil trade

**Collins 2-18**-2025, Senior Analyst @ S&P Global Ratings (Laura,
2-18-2025, \"Canadian Oil Producers Likely Resilient To Potential
Tariffs,\" S&P Global,
https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/250218-canadian-oil-producers-likely-resilient-to-potential-tariffs-13404632)
\[Charts omitted\]

U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Feb. 1, 2025, that his
administration planned to impose a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports
effective Feb. 4, 2025. The president subsequently postponed these
tariffs for 30 days pending ongoing negotiations with the Canadian
government. [[If]{.mark} these **[tariffs take
effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[we expect the [financial
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the tariff [on both U.S. refiners and
Canadian producers [will be **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[U.S. refining capacity is]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly [[higher
than domestic]{.mark} oil [production, making the country reliant
on]{.mark} millions of barrels per day of [imported]{.mark} crude
[oil]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Energy Information Administration (EIA)
estimates U.S. refining capacity is about 18.4 million barrels per day
(MMbbl/d), while total crude oil production is about 13.3 MMbbl/d.
Though the Trump administration may make it easier to drill on federal
lands and garner drilling permits, we believe U.S. producers will
maintain capital discipline and focus on free cash flow generation,
limiting production growth. Accordingly, [we expect the U.S. to remain
dependent on imported crude to fuel its refineries for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [[many U.S. refineries are]{.mark} high-complexity that are
[specifically configured to run heavy crudes, which are not produced
domestically]{.mark}.]{.underline} Accordingly, [U.S. crude imports
([with Canada being the largest source]{.mark}) are skewed toward heavy
grades]{.underline}. U.S. refiners could shift crude slates to process
lighter, sweeter, domestically produced crude, but we anticipate this
would result in less efficiencies and lower utilizations.

Canadian oil represents more than 60% of current U.S. crude imports. S&P
Global Commodity Insights (SPCI) estimates total Canadian crude oil
production for the first nine months of 2024 averaged roughly 5.7
MMbbl/d, with just over 70% of this production (or 4.1 MMbbl/d) exported
to U.S. markets. This represents about 62% of total U.S. crude oil
imports. Approximately three quarters of the Canadian barrels exported
to the U.S. are heavy oil barrels. Most of these barrels flow to
refineries in the U.S. Midwest (PADD 2).

[In the U.S. Midwest and Rocky Mountains, [refiners have]{.mark}
**physically** integrated [**hardwired** pipeline supply from Canada
with no]{.mark} true [alternative feedstock]{.mark} supply
[sources]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the first nine months of 2024, PADD 2
and PADD 4 refineries collectively represented about 70% of the total
Canadian heavy oil imports in the U.S. Many of these refineries are
specially designed to process heavy, sour crude blends like Canada\'s
Western Canadian Select (WCS) and have fixed pipeline sourcing for this
Canadian crude. SPCI estimates Canadian crude represents about 56% of
PADD 2 refinery crude runs and 44% of PADD 4 crude runs, with the
balance being U.S. domestic supply. Accordingly, we expect PADD 2 and
PADD 4 refiners\' crude costs would increase with the announced tariffs
given the lack of alternative non-tariffed supply sources.

Refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast have more optionality to source crude
from non-tariffed countries. Exports to the Gulf Coast represented
almost one quarter of total Canadian heavy oil exports to the U.S. for
the first nine months of 2024. SPCI estimates roughly 12% of PADD 3
(Gulf Coast) refinery crude runs are Canadian crude imports, with
another 19% from non-Canadian imports.

While Gulf Coast refiners could look to replace their current Canadian
crude purchases with incremental imports from non-tariffed markets,
[[alternative sources]{.mark} of heavy crude [are not plentiful]{.mark},
and non-tariffed suppliers will have price leverage]{.underline}. We
therefore expect increasing crude feedstock costs for these refiners as
well, though likely not to the same extent as for PADD 2 and PADD 4
refiners. Ultimately, Canadian heavy barrels clearing on the Gulf Coast
set the price of heavy crude in western Canada for the many Canadian
producers who sell their crude in-basin in Alberta.

We believe Canadian producers will share the financial impact of tariffs
given Canada\'s lack of alternative buyers for its production. Canada
has limited optionality to sell its crude to non-U.S. buyers given its
limited tidewater access to ship crude from its coastlines to buyers in
Europe or Asia. Apart from the recently expanded Trans Mountain pipeline
system, which has capacity to move 890,000 bbl/d to Canada\'s West Coast
where it can then be sold to Asia, there is scarce access to alternative
global purchasers for Canadian crude. President Trump\'s executive order
does, however, state that the duty would apply only to goods imported
for consumption. In this case, Canadian producers could look to avoid
the tariff by redirecting barrels currently sold to U.S. buyers to
export hubs such as Cushing for the purpose of re-export to non-U.S.
purchasers.

Canada also lacks the refining capacity to process most of its domestic
crude oil production. SPCI estimates Canada\'s refinery runs averaged
about 1.7 MMbbl/d for the first nine months of 2024, or only about 30%
of the country\'s domestic production for the same period. Furthermore,
most refineries in Canada were originally designed to process the light,
sweet crude oil produced in Western Canada. Accordingly, unlike large
complex U.S. refineries, Canadian refineries have limited capacity to
process the increasing Canadian oil sands production without significant
capital investment.

Given the inability of Canadian producers to easily redirect their
current U.S. sales to other markets or process additional barrels
domestically, we believe Canadian producers will share a portion of the
financial impact of the tariffs with the U.S. refiners purchasing
Canadian crude.

We believe the tariffs will likely lead to wider discounts on Canadian
crude prices. A widening WCS heavy oil differential could constrain many
Canadian producers, given heavy oil represents the largest share of
Canadian crude production and exports. The completion of the Trans
Mountain Expansion project in May of 2024 resulted in a more stable WCS
differential for the second half of 2024. SPCI estimates the
differential averaged about \$12.35/bbl in November 2024, the month
before President Trump began threatening tariffs on Canadian imports.
Since then, the differential has widened about 13%, with SPCI expecting
the differential to average about \$13.90 below West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) for January.

On Feb. 3, 2025, the day the president postponed the tariffs, the WCS
differential widened to just under \$18/bbl. In our view, the
differential would likely remain in the \$13/bbl-\$18/bbl range under
our current \$70/bbl WTI price assumption because an \$18/bbl
differential would absorb essentially the entire 10% import tariff when
compared to the pre-tariff threat WCS differential of \$12/bbl-\$13/bbl.

Nevertheless, [a **weak Canadian dollar** will offset the impact of
discounted prices on credit metrics. Recently the Canadian dollar has
weakened meaningfully relative to the U.S. dollar]{.underline},
primarily because of the tariff risk. The Bank of Canada estimates the
C\$/US\$ foreign exchange (FX) rate averaged 1.4390 for January of 2025
compared to 1.3975 in November of 2024. The Canadian dollar has weakened
about 5% relative to the 2024 annual average FX rate of 1.3698. We
expect the implementation of tariffs on all Canadian imports would keep
the Canadian dollar at its current depressed level or weaken further.

However, [a weaker Canadian dollar is largely beneficial to Canadian oil
producers because their revenues are largely U.S.-dollar denominated
since crude oil barrels are priced in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, a
relatively stronger U.S. dollar results in higher top-line Canadian
dollar revenue]{.underline}, all else equal. [We therefore
anticipate]{.underline} that a meaningful portion of
**[any]{.underline}** widening **[[discounts on Canadian crude will be
offset by a weaker Canadian dollar]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Chart 5 shows
the historical impact of fluctuations in the C\$/US\$ exchange rate on
Canadian producers\' realized price per barrel in Canadian dollars.

Accordingly, [[we anticipate **no change** to]{.mark} the credit
[ratings of]{.mark} our rated [Canadian oil producers]{.mark} because of
the newly enacted tariffs]{.underline}. [We [believe it is unlikely
Canadian producers will]{.mark} need to [shoulder the entire]{.mark}
financial [burden]{.mark} of the 10% tariff [given]{.mark} the [reliance
of many U.S. refiners on Canadian]{.mark} crude
[imports]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, even in such a case, we believe
the impact to overall credit metrics would be relatively minimal due to
the meaningful offset of a depressed Canadian dollar. Furthermore, [most
[producers\' balance sheets and leverage metrics are
**strong**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the industry remains focused on
spending within internal free cash flow generation. While many producers
have met their debt reduction goals and are now distributing significant
amounts of free cash flow to shareholders, we believe many may reduce
distributions to preserve liquidity and balance sheet strength if market
conditions deteriorate below our current expectations.

#### A 10% tariff isn't [a death blow]{.underline}.

**Varcoe 25**, business columnist at the Calgary Herald (Chris,
3-4-2025, \"Varcoe: \'The damage is done\': Flow of Canadian oil to U.S.
continues, even as relationship fractures,\" calgaryherald,
https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/varcoe-flow-canadian-oil-united-states-continues-relationship-fractures)

[On the same day]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [Trump started a
tariff war]{.underline} with his neighbours, [North American energy
giant [**Enbridge** announced plans to expand its]{.mark} **main
[pipeline network]{.mark}** [to transport more]{.mark} Canadian [oil
into the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.

[The initiative by the Calgary-based company represents a commitment
of]{.underline} up to \$**[2 billion]{.underline}** of capital
investment over the next three years.

The news, coming hours after the U.S. imposed tariffs on all Canadian
imports, reflects the pull of energy flows.

[[Although the]{.underline}]{.mark} integrated [North American [energy
system has]{.mark} just [been dealt a blow]{.mark}]{.underline} by the
U.S. trade action, **[[it still matters]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"[Any [tariff disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}, trade disputes, always
[[create]{.mark} some [concern]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[then you have
to put your head]{.mark} back [in
**fundamentals**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Enbridge CEO Greg Ebel told
reporters on Tuesday after the company's investor day.

"You can't say it's of no concern. It's just from a fundamentals
perspective, you're really trying to take the emotions out of it and go
to what's the economic reality and the interconnection between the two
countries.

"And I think [on **any basis**, [you]{.mark} would [have to **still
say**]{.mark}, it's tight, it's difficult to break and [it's
**strong**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- current **[[unpleasantries
aside]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

[That's still true, [as more than **four million**]{.mark}]{.underline}
barrels per day (**[[bpd]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[of Canadian oil flows
into the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates,
[representing this country's single-biggest export item.]{.underline}

However, that doesn't mean the energy interdependence hasn't been
rattled or won't shift over time.

"I think the damage is done to the trade relationship," energy economist
Peter Tertzakian said in an interview.

"It's a permanent change in mindset and we shall see how federal and
provincial governments think about this, in terms of working with
industry to find alternatives and more diverse markets for our oil and
gas products."

Trump initiated a trade war against both Mexico and Canada, putting a 10
per cent tax on energy and a 25 per cent levy on all products, beginning
Tuesday. It quickly triggered counter-tariffs from Ottawa.

It comes just days after Trump put out a social media post calling for
the revival of the Keystone XL pipeline to bring more Canadian oil into
the U.S.

"[[Ten per cent is]{.underline}]{.mark} still
[[meaningful]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.mark} it's **[not
life-threatening]{.mark}**]{.underline} or anything to the good
companies," said Surge Energy CEO Paul Colborne.

#### Trump's tariffs are a paper tiger, and [the market knows it]{.underline}. 

**Bloomberg 3-10**-2025 (Bloomberg News, \"Surge in Canadian crude
signals tariff concern is waning,\" BNN Bloomberg,
https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2025/03/10/surge-in-canadian-crude-signals-tariff-concern-is-waning/)

[[Concern about]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. President Donald [[**Trump's
threats** to]{.underline}]{.mark} impose
**[[tariff]{.underline}]{.mark}**s on U.S. imports of [[**Canadian oil**
is **waning** as]{.mark} [the]{.mark} duties' [**start date** **keeps
getting pushed back**]{.mark}, strengthening local crude
prices.]{.underline}

Heavy Western Canadian Select for delivery in April was trading at
\$11.70 less per barrel than US benchmark West Texas Intermediate on
Monday, according to people familiar with prices. That's the narrowest
discount since Nov. 15, before Trump --- then president-elect --- first
threatened tariffs on Canadian imports.

Adding to speculation the tariffs won't affect Canadian crude, US
[Energy Secretary]{.underline} Chris **[[Wright]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} on Monday that a [scenario where **[an
agreement]{.mark}** is reached and US tariffs on Canada and Mexico are
pulled back [is possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The tariffs]{.underline}, including 10% on Canadian energy imports and
25% on everything else from Canada and Mexico, [were scheduled to go
into force]{.underline} on Feb. 4.

[They were first delayed by a month and then delayed again last
week]{.underline}, albeit only on items covered by the North American
trade agreement known as USMCA.

"I feel like we are in bizarro world," said Susan Bell, a Rystad Energy
analyst. "[[The tariff risk is being **discounted by the
market**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- given how negative the market moved
when the tariffs were put in place. Trump is risking a deeply unpopular
move on the economy."

Canadian heavy crude's discount jumped to as wide as \$15.50 in January
as Trump reiterated plans to impose the duties on America's closest
neighbors. Since then, the discount has gradually narrowed as the
tariffs were delayed.

Also helping the price, [the executive order indicates [tariffs won't
apply to Canadian oil exported off the Gulf Coast]{.mark} and some oil
sands facilities are set to start maintenance in April,]{.underline}
reducing output.

[[Oil demand in the US will be **stronger in April**]{.mark} than in
March, [and the **Trans Mountain pipeline**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which
lets Canadian producers ship to non-US markets, [is probably going to be
full]{.mark}]{.underline}, pulling Canadian heavy oil crude out of the
US Midwest, Bell said.

The April discount for WCS reflects "tighter heavy balance but no
discount to accommodate the tariff," she said.

in 1990 the US freight company OmniTrax bought the town's port from the

#### Warming [blunts]{.underline} extreme cold and unthaws [swathes of farmland]{.underline}\-\--that's a [boon]{.underline} for Canada

**Oliver 19**, MBA @ Harvard, former Minister of Natural Resources,
citing **Moody's Analytics** (Joe, 8-15-2019, \"Joe Oliver: Here's a
truth few dare to utter: Canada will benefit from climate change,\"
Financial Post,
https://financialpost.com/opinion/joe-oliver-heres-a-truth-few-dare-to-utter-canada-will-benefit-from-climate-change)

Why should Canada fight climate change?

Finally, someone proclaimed an obvious truth that few dare to utter
publicly. According to Moody's Analytics, [Canada will **benefit** from
climate change]{.underline}. Although it will shock many, this forecast
should surprise no one. [[Canada is]{.mark} a very large, [**cold
country**, with]{.mark} [90 per cent of its population]{.mark}
huddled]{.underline} with[[in]{.mark} 100 miles of [its south]{.mark}ern
border [and]{.mark}]{.underline} an **[[enormous
ag]{.underline}]{.mark}**ricultural [**[potential]{.mark}** if the
**land warms**]{.underline} up. [There will **[also]{.mark}** be new
[opportunities for oil, gas and mineral development in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And let's not ignore the greater
personal comfort of living in a more hospitable climate.

According to a CBC story about Moody's study, "[[when]{.mark} all the
changes to things like **[tourism]{.mark}** demand, crop [**yields** and
the **growing season** are factored in, there's a]{.mark} **slight [net
positive]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Assuming a one-degree Celsius temperature rise, Moody's calculates that
our economy would be unaffected in 2048. [A rise of]{.underline} 2.4
degrees would increase GDP by 0.1 per cent and [**[four
degrees]{.mark}** [would **boost** it]{.mark} by 0**[.3 per
cent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Not much, but still positive]{.underline},
and certainly not the terrifying calamity we are warned to expect.

[The impact on **farming**]{.underline}, however, **[would be
dramatic]{.underline}**. [In the three Prairie provinces alone, an area
more than twice the size of France, arable land could
increase]{.underline} between 26 and **[40 per cent]{.underline}** by
2040, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. [[With]{.mark}
improvements in farm tech]{.underline}nology, [**[drought-resistant
crops]{.underline}** [and **new harvesting**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[methods, [Canada would]{.mark} have a wonderful opportunity to help
**[feed a hungry world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And not a moment too
soon: according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization,
agricultural output needs to increase by 50 per cent over the next 30
years to keep pace with world population growth.

oil and gas extraction hit a record \$33.8 billion; that's more than all
royalties from 2016-20 combined. The boost comes not just from higher
prices but from Alberta's strategy to charge significantly higher
royalties---up to 40 percent---from oilsands facilities whose upfront
development costs have been paid off and revenues are exceeding
operating expenses.

A large number of facilities have already reached this threshold, and
more are added each year. This flexible new paradigm of permanently
higher royalties helps governments moderate the budget rollercoaster of
volatile oil prices: nine times more at \$55/barrel, and four and half
times more at \$120/barrel. Next year, when the TMX pipeline adds more
than half a million barrels a day of capacity from the oilsands to new
markets, the value of royalties will also increase, along with corporate
taxes.

Of course, [the oilsands **still face headwinds** from
Ottawa]{.underline}, none bigger than a proposal to reduce oil and gas
emissions by 42 percent (from 2019 levels) by 2030. [[Although]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} oil]{.underline} and gas [[sector has invested]{.mark}
heavily [in emissions reductions]{.mark}, and
g]{.underline}reen[h]{.underline}ouse [g]{.underline}as [intensity per
barrel fell 20 percent]{.underline} between 2009 and 2020, [[there is no
way to meet the new target without **cutting
production**]{.underline}]{.mark}. S&P Global estimates that
[1]{.underline}.3 [million barrels of daily output will need to be
slashed, [which would be an **existential threat to the
sector**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fortunately, the political tide in Canada
is turning in such a way that the oilsands could hang on long enough to
see friendlier policies.

**Slav 25**, writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience
writing on the oil and gas industry. (Irina, 1-30-2025, \"Alberta Seeks
Diversification Away From Oil,\" OilPrice,
https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Alberta-Seeks-Diversification-Away-From-Oil.html)

[[Alberta is seeking]{.mark} ways [to improve the return]{.mark} rates
[of its wealth fund and boost its size]{.mark}
considerably]{.underline}, from about C\$24.3 billion now to some C\$250
billion, or \$173 billion, Bloomberg has reported.

[[The purpose]{.underline}]{.mark}, per the report, [[is
**reducing**]{.mark} **the province's [dependence on oil and gas]{.mark}
revenues** because this dependence makes Alberta]{.underline}
"[susceptible to the highs and lows of global energy
markets,]{.underline} which can change rapidly and unpredictably,"
according to the provincial government.

To that end, [[the government]{.underline}]{.mark} of Alberta [[has set
up a]{.mark} new corporation to manage the **[wealth fund]{.mark}** and
seek new investment opportunities that would boost returns]{.underline}.
Per brand new legislation, [[the fund will]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[reinvest all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of its [**[returns]{.mark}**
instead of distributing them to the province.]{.underline}

"[When the royalties dry up]{.underline} or start to become
significantly smaller, [the only tool a government has is to seek more
revenue through the tax base]{.underline}," Alberta Finance Minister
Nate Horner told Bloomberg in an interview.

"[[By]{.mark} being diligent and **[allowing this to
grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}, by the time we get to C\$250 billion,
[[we'll]{.mark} have the ability to [use this]{.mark} in an annual way
[to]{.mark} help **[offset revenue needs]{.mark}** within
government]{.underline}."

[Alberta receives over a quarter of its revenues from]{.underline} the
[oil and gas]{.underline} industry, with the total amount for this
budget year estimated at some C\$20.3 billion, or around \$14 billion.
That appears to be an uncomfortably high degree of dependence on oil and
gas revenues for the provincial government.

[The Alberta Heritage **Savings Trust Fund** currently has an annual
rate of return of 7%, which is not too shabby]{.underline} at all, but
the government of the province wants to boost this to 9% by 2050. For
context, as provided by Bloomberg, Norway's sovereign wealth fund has an
annual return rate of 6.3%, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority---the
UAE's sovereign wealth fund---has returned an average of 6.8% over the
past 30 years.

The importance of managing the lengthy transition to new energy sources

[There is an extensive lit]{.underline}erature [on the difficulty of
making the transition from one dominant energy source to
another]{.underline}, even when a lower cost for the new energy source
provides an incentive to make the shift. [We know this because nations
with advanced economies have made the transition to new primary energy
sources several times over the past two centuries]{.underline}, moving
from wood to coal to petroleum to natural gas (see Fouquet 2009, 11).
Canada has made similar transitions to new energy sources. These include
a "shift from reliance on wood, to coal, electricity (created first by
coal and then hydro and then nuclear energy), oil, and then natural gas"
(Sandwell 2016, 16). Today, [many foresee a shift from
fossil]{.underline} fuel[s]{.underline} [to renewable
energy]{.underline} sources such as solar, wind, nuclear, and hydro in
response to climate change.

[One lesson from past energy transitions]{.underline}, however, [is they
require **several decades to complete**]{.underline}. [Coal is one
example of how slowly these transitions occur]{.underline}. [Coal
provided]{.underline} just [7]{.underline}.3 [percent of
Canada's]{.underline} total [energy consumption in 1871]{.underline},
[rising to]{.underline} 41 percent 30 years later in 1902, and then an
all-time high of [66 percent in 1918]{.underline} (Watson 2016, 21).
Even then, [the timeline during which Canada embraced coal is relatively
rapid for an energy transition]{.underline}. After reviewing the changes
in the world's primary energy consumption, one researcher observed that
"**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Industrial Age **[[energy sources
follow a similar trend]{.underline}]{.mark}** when entering the market.
[[It takes]{.mark} 40 to **[50 years]{.mark}** for an energy source [to
go from 1% to 10%]{.mark} of market share, [and]{.mark} an energy source
that eventually comes to occupy **[half]{.mark}** of the market [will
take]{.mark} **almost [a century]{.mark}**]{.underline} to do so" (de
Sousa, quoted in Rhodes 2018, 339). Yergin summarized how "history
demonstrates that [energy transition **takes a long time**.]{.underline}
[It took almost a century before oil overtook coal as the number one
energy source]{.underline}" (2011, 715). Smil concludes that [a global
energy transition]{.underline} "[takes]{.underline} two or **[three
generations]{.underline}**, or 50--75 years, [for a new resource to
capture a large share]{.underline} of the energy market" (2017, 395).

[Energy transitions span decades because of]{.underline} what Yergin
calls "the law of **[long lead times]{.underline}**" (2011, 715). [One
reason]{.underline} for the long lead [is the time required to learn how
to make and use new energy sources]{.underline}. For example, gasoline
used in motor vehicles meant "filling stations need gasoline, gasoline
comes from oil, oil had to be discovered, refineries had to process it,
pipelines had to deliver the oil to the refineries and the gasoline to
the cities where the cars were driven" (Rhodes 2018, 339).

Most importantly, [energy transitions take time [because
of]{.mark}]{.underline} "[the **prerequisites** for [**enormous
infrastructure investment** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[inertia
of]{.mark} massively [embedded]{.mark} energy
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Smil 2017, 397). [[Energy systems
require]{.mark} **huge amounts of [capital]{.mark}**, often with life
spans of 60 years or more]{.underline} in the case of commercial
buildings, industrial and power plants, and residential homes. Building
a major new offshore oil platform or an oil sands plant requires a
decade or more. It takes five years to develop a new automobile and the
auto fleet turns over at a rate of only about 8 percent a year, implying
a total overhaul of the fleet needs two decades to complete (Yergin
2011, 715).

[Because of the considerable capital embedded in the existing energy
infrastructure built upon fossil fuels, weaning our society off fossil
fuels will be]{.underline} a **[much more difficult]{.underline}**
process [than many assume]{.underline}. [Our energy-dependent
civilization involves a wide range of infrastructure,
including]{.underline} "[[mines]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[oil and gas
fields]{.underline}]{.mark}, thermal [[power
stations]{.underline}]{.mark}, hydroelectric
[[dams]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[pipeline]{.underline}]{.mark}
network[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}, [ports]{.underline},
[refineries]{.underline}, iron and [steel [mills]{.mark}]{.underline},
aluminum [[smelters]{.underline}]{.mark}, [fertilizer
plants]{.underline}, railroads, multilane [highways]{.underline},
airports, skyscraper-dominated downtowns, an extensive suburbia" (Smil
2017, 422). The reality is that [**[fossil]{.mark}** fuel[**s** will be
part of our econ]{.mark}omy [for **decades**]{.mark} to
come]{.underline}, and our economic, energy, and environmental policies
need to be grounded in this reality. [The goal of **[net-zero]{.mark}**
emissions [by **2050** assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} usual
[decades-long transition]{.mark}]{.underline} to new energy sources
[[can be shortened dramatically]{.mark}, [when the **current
trajectory** of]{.mark} both fossil fuel and [green energy]{.mark}
production [points to a **slow transition**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[A [chart listing]{.mark} countries and [tariffs]{.mark} that Trump

[**[Canada]{.underline}**, [including oil,]{.underline}]{.mark} [would
**[remain]{.mark} [exempt]{.mark}** from the tariffs, a senior
official]{.underline} told Reuters. Canada supplies some 4 million
barrels per day of its crude oil to the United States. Trump\'s tariff
policies could stoke inflation, slow economic growth and escalate trade
disputes, possibilities that have limited oil price gains. \"[[Crude
prices have paused last month\'s rally,]{.mark}]{.underline} with Brent
finding some resistance above \$75, with the focus for now turning from
a sanctions-led reduction in supply to Trump\'s tariff announcement and
its potential negative impact on growth and demand,\" said Ole Hansen,
head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Comments from Mexico eased some
worries about a trade war between the two countries after Mexican
President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that Mexico does not plan
to impose tit-for-tat tariffs on the United States. \"[[Oil is selling
off a little on the news]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it could introduce
some additional trade and economic uncertainties, [**[but]{.underline}**
[I think people were worried it would be **more

[[Despite]{.mark} the broad reach of the new [tariffs, the **energy

that non-compliant CUSMA (Canada--U.S.--Mexico Agreement) goods would

broader equity markets saw a sharper reaction. S&P 500 futures dropped

### UQ\-\--AT: Oil Prices Low\-\--2NC

#### Tariffs are a neg arg\-\--Canada was [exempted]{.underline}, giving it a [new comparative advantage]{.underline}

president Candace Laing (\*Mark and \*\*Nojoud Al Mallees, \"Canada,
Mexico spared from worst of Trump's latest tariff blitz,\" Globe and
Mail,
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/economy/article-canada-mexico-spared-from-worst-of-trumps-latest-tariff-blitz/)

[While]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} took a
sledgehammer to the global trading system]{.underline} on Wednesday, [he
[offered a **reprieve to Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline} and Mexico,
potentially **[[putting]{.mark} his [neighbours at a competitive
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}** if they stay within the bounds of the
continental trade agreement.

In his most sweeping protectionist measures yet, Mr. Trump placed a
10-per-cent baseline tariff on imports into the U.S., with considerably
higher tariffs on dozens of trading partners including the European
Union, China and Japan.

**[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Mexico, however, **[[will not face
the baseline tariff or]{.mark} a higher [country-specific
duty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Both remain subject to the
across-the-board tariffs imposed in early March]{.underline}, ostensibly
to force Ottawa and Mexico City to address border security problems.
[However, [goods that comply with]{.mark}]{.underline} the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (**[[USMCA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) will
**[[remain exempt]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

That means a significant portion of
[**[Canad]{.mark}**i**[a]{.mark}**n]{.underline} and Mexican [goods
[will continue to trade **tariff-free**]{.mark}, while other countries
face a steep jump in duties. In effect, Mr. [Trump is forcing
**more**]{.mark}]{.underline} North American
**[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to happen under]{.mark} the auspices
of the **[USMCA]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while making it prohibitively
expensive for companies to export non-compliant goods to the U.S.

Globe economics reporter Mark Rendell says Wednesday's tariff
announcement by President Donald Trump saw Canada not hit as hard as
predicted, but that the trade war has now gone global.

CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in an e-mail that Canada
appears to have gotten off lighter than expected, but that remaining
tariffs on aluminum and steel as well as vehicles and auto parts are
still "very problematic."

According to economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank, the effective tariff
rate Canada now faces from the U.S. is roughly 10 per cent, up from less
than 2 per cent before Mr. Trump took office. CIBC economists,
meanwhile, estimate the average effective tariff rate could be 5 per
cent if all goods become compliant with the USMCA.

Nevertheless, [Canadian **[business groups]{.mark}** on Wednesday
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} tepidly **[[optimistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that Mr. [Trump's decision to leave out Canada and Mexico from
reciprocal tariffs means any trade-related disputes can be punted off to
the renegotiation of the USMCA]{.underline}. The agreement is up for a
review in July, 2026, though politicians may push for negotiations
sooner.

"We hope that today's positioning regarding Canada by the U.S. is part
of a path to real negotiation, ultimately leading to long-term
partnership focused on continental economic security and resilience,"
said Chamber of Commerce president Candace Laing in a statement.

There's also some hope that [[border]{.mark}-related [tariffs]{.mark}
imposed on Canada and Mexico [may be **lifted**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The executive order issued on Wednesday notes that if those levies are
removed, a 12-per-cent tariff would apply to goods that are not
compliant of the USMCA -- less than half of existing the 25-per-cent
rate.

"It suggests to me that **[there is a path forward here]{.underline}**.
It's not straight line. It'll require a lot of effort. But all in all[,
I would say [it **wasn't a bad day for Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Business Council of Canada president Goldy Hyder told The Globe and
Mail.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump's new global
tariffs "are going to fundamentally change the international trading
system" but that the U.S. President "has preserved a number of important
elements of our trading relationship."

How that change in the international trading system will affect Canada
is still unclear, as economists see both opportunity and risk.

Mr. Shenfeld said that the higher-than-expected global tariffs "could
push up inflation and hit confidence south of the border, which can also
dent Canada's export volumes. So, there's still work for Canada's
incoming government to try to get to the negotiating table and see if we
can reach a mutually beneficial deal with the U.S."

At the same time, some [[Canadian exporters may **benefit relative to
their competitors**]{.mark} in other countries now facing steep
tariffs.]{.underline}

#### Trump didn't actually impose any tariffs on Canada!

**Gowling 4-2**-2025, journalist (Jordan, \"Canada escapes new levies as
Trump imposes sweeping reciprocal tariffs,\" financialpost,
https://financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-announces-reciprocal-tariffs)

United States President Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[announced]{.underline} sweeping [reciprocal tariffs]{.underline}
against U.S. trading partners on Wednesday, [but [**did not apply an
additional levy** on Canada.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"This is one of the most important days in my opinion, in American
history," Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. "It's our
declaration of economic independence."

During a sprawling press conference, Trump railed against countries he
alleged have blocked U.S. access to their markets, stolen intellectual
property and imposed "exorbitant" taxes on U.S. firms.

He then read from a chart that listed reciprocal tariff rates the U.S.
was imposing on many countries, with tariffs ranging as high as 49 per
cent set to take effect on April 9. Significant trading partners on the
list included China, which will be hit with a 34 per cent tariff, and
the European Union, which is facing a 20 per cent tariff. According to
an executive order signed by the president, all U.S. trading partners
will be subject to a baseline 10 per cent tariff as of April 5.

**[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [**[was not on the
list]{.mark}**, and [the ex]{.mark}]{.underline}ecutive
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}rder later **[[confirmed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that [[it would not face]{.mark} additional
[tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Rather]{.underline}, [[the
existing]{.mark} tariff [regime]{.mark}, [which **exempts** goods
covered by]{.mark}]{.underline} the Canada-United-States-Mexico
Agreement (**[[CUSMA]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[will remain]{.mark} in
place.]{.underline}

The exemption on CUSMA goods and tariffs of 25 per cent on non-CUSMA
goods and 10 per cent on non-CUSMA energy and potash "are unaffected by
this order," a White House fact sheet said.

#### Demand is [resilient]{.underline} and prices will [skyrocket]{.underline} from future refinery [closures]{.underline}. Only policies like the aff [destroy]{.underline} the market.

on the oil and gas industry, (Irina, April 2, 2025, "One in Five
Refineries Faces Shutdown Despite Rising Fuel Demand," *Oilprice*,
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/One-in-Five-Refineries-Faces-Shutdown-Despite-Rising-Fuel-Demand.html

[[Refineries]{.mark} are]{.underline} switching to biofuels or
[**[shutting down]{.mark}** due to **hostile
regulations**]{.underline}---[but **[demand]{.mark}** for oil products
is **[growing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This could [result
in]{.mark}]{.underline} either [a market **[imbalance]{.mark}** that
will [make]{.mark} these [products more
**expensive**]{.mark}]{.underline} or a geographical imbalance, which
those who care about supply security wouldn't like.

A total of [**[101]{.mark}** out of **410** [refineries]{.mark} around
the world are [**at risk** of]{.mark} getting [shut]{.mark}
[down]{.mark} over the next decade]{.underline}, Wood Mackenzie analysts
estimated recently, noting that this number represented [[**21%** of
global]{.mark} refining [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reasons for
this estimate include peak oil demand that would reduce demand for the
output of refineries and high operating costs in places such as Europe,
which collect carbon taxes from their energy industry.

Indeed, Wood Mac considers the [inflated **[operating costs]{.mark}** of
refineries [an]{.mark} especially [important risk factor]{.mark} for
their future prospects, as well as their investments in
**decarbonization**.]{.underline} "Refineries without committed
investments in low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture, energy
efficiency upgrades, or alternative fuels, are especially exposed," the
analysts wrote. "[Those located in [regions with]{.mark} established or
escalating **[carbon pricing]{.mark}** costs, including the EU, UK, and
Canada, are [under]{.mark} [the **greatest
pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[The **carbon prices** in these jurisdictions are [scheduled to
rise]{.mark} to **[three times]{.mark}** above the global
**[average]{.mark}** [by **2035**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the analysts
also noted, [[which will]{.mark} likely [make]{.mark} the
**[continuation]{.mark}** of the life of some refineries]{.underline} in
the EU, the UK, and Canada **[[economically
nonsensical]{.underline}]{.mark}**---unless policies change.

At the end of last year, analysts and traders told Reuters they expected
higher diesel prices this year because of refinery closures. At the time
the report came out, refiners were experiencing depressed margins across
geographies. But with several refineries slated for shutdown this year,
things were going to change---which suggests [**demand** for fuel
remained **stable** if not actively **growing**]{.underline}.

Yet some have forecast demand will grow this year, [even as **three**
**large** refining facilities close]{.underline}: the Grangemouth
refinery, Scotland's only crude processing facility, which is set to
close in the second quarter of 2025; LyondellBasell's Houston oil
refinery, and the Los Angeles refinery of Phillips 66, scheduled for
closure by the end of next year.

[These three represent refining capacity of some **1 million barrels
daily**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, however, around 800,000 bpd in new
refining capacity is set to launch in Asia, strengthening the argument
that operating costs are a crucial factor, and so are carbon taxes:
[**Asian** countries have **nowhere** near the **stringent** **carbon
tax**]{.underline} legislation that the UK, the European Union, and
California have. So, these 800,000 bpd in [**fresh capacity** would
certainly **compensate** for the closures, but they are capacity
**abroad**]{.underline}, **[not at home]{.underline}**, [and many have
come to view this as a potential problem for **supply
security**]{.underline}---hence the EU's intention to invest directly in
LNG production across the world, for instance.

In this context, it is interesting that the Wood Mac analysis points to
Europe and China as homes to most refineries that are at risk of
closure. While in Europe the top reason seems to be the carbon tax and
its effect on operating costs, for China, the chief factor is
decarbonization and more specifically the electrification of transport.

Many observers have argued that China's concerted electrification push
and the diversification into LNG-powered trucks would kill a lot of oil
demand. Indeed, consumption data suggests there has been an impact. Yet
a new refinery just started operating in China a few months ago, and
more recently, its second unit started up, adding a fresh 400,000 bpd to
the country's total capacity. It seems demand is not quite dead yet and
will not be for some time---especially for those who make their
refineries petrochemical complexes, too.

[The **refining** and **petrochemical** facilities have the best chances
of **survival**]{.underline}, according to Wood Mackenzie. This is
because most forecasts for fuel demand, albeit based on policies that
are not as immutable as most assume, see a drop in that over the medium
term. Most [forecasts for **plastics**, on the other hand, are rather
brighter, **regardless of climate policies**.]{.underline}

If closures proceed as predicted, which is quite likely in the current
political context in places such as Europe, the EU, and Canada, [there
is a [risk of]{.mark} fuel **[shortages]{.mark}**
[emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}, as reported by the U.S. Energy
Information Administration in the March edition of its Short-Term Energy
Outlook. The reason: [while refineries are **shutting down**,
**[demand]{.mark}** [for fuels]{.mark}, notably diesel, has
[repeatedly]{.mark} **[surprised]{.mark}** [to the
**upside**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[To tackle]{.mark} the potential
**[shortage]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the EIA said [the **U.S.** might
have to **curb fuel exports**]{.underline}---[because energy **supply
security** is important]{.underline}.

It appears, then, that [**[demand]{.mark}** is [not the **primary**
reason for]{.mark} refinery [closures]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With
[EV]{.mark} [sales **disappointing** and]{.mark} a "**revolution**" in
the [electrification]{.mark} of transport **[never]{.mark}** quite
really [happening]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}
for fuels [[looks]{.mark} rather
**[stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[and]{.mark} still
**[growing]{.mark}** **[despite]{.mark}** the **[unquestionable
rise]{.mark}** in EVs on roads]{.underline}. So, [refinery
closures]{.underline} appear [motivated by other factors]{.underline},
notably operating costs. These are rising due to openly hostile policies
to the energy industry---and the resulting closures are threatening the
security of fuel supply and significantly increasing the risk of
boosting reliance on imported fuels.

#### Market pessimism is [ending]{.underline}. Demand [exceeds]{.underline} supply across the board.

**Kimani 3-27**, \*Finance Writer, Oil Price, (\*Alex, March 27, 2025,
"Oil Prices Rise On Improving Market Sentiment," *Oil Price*,
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Oil-Prices-Rise-On-Improving-Market-Sentiment.html)

[[Oil prices]{.mark} are looking to [finish]{.mark} the week [in the
**green**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} [the
**[pessimism]{.mark}** that dominated the markets in the early part of
the year [beginning to]{.mark} **[dissipate]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**Brent** crude for May]{.underline} delivery [was trading]{.underline}
at \$73.67 per barrel at 11.50 am ET in Thursday's session, flat on the
day [but nearly **\$2 higher** from a week ago while the corresponding
**WTI** contract]{.underline} was unchanged on the day but [similarly
**gained** **\$2** from a week ago]{.underline} to trade at \$69.67 per
barrel. [Oil [prices]{.mark} [have]{.mark} now **[climbed]{.mark}**
about **[\$5 per barrel]{.mark}** [from their]{.mark} **[early-month
lows]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

A recent [**[Dallas Fed]{.mark}** Energy Survey
[revealed]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[activity]{.mark} in the oil and
gas sector **[increased]{.mark}** slightly [in the **first
quarter**]{.mark} of 2025]{.underline} while the company outlook index
decreased 12 points to -4.9, suggesting slight pessimism among energy
companies.

According to the latest Baker Hughes data, [U.S. rig counts have
continued their sideways move]{.underline}, falling by one w/w to 486.
Rig count has remained in the 472-488 range for 41 consecutive weeks.
The Permian Basin rig count fell by one w/w to 300, having previously
been below 300 for just one week in the past three years. The main
change was in the Texas portion of the Delaware Basin where drilling
fell by three w/w to a three-year low of 62 rigs. In contrast, the U.S.
gas rig count rose by two w/w to 102, with the Haynesville and Marcellus
rig count unchanged at 30 and 26, respectively. Likewise, positioning
across the energy complex remains mainly negative, with traders
concerned about Trump's tariffs as well as a potential return of Russian
oil flows.

And now commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have buttressed the
growing bullish thesis, saying [oil market **[sentiment]{.mark}**
[continues to **improve** after]{.mark} the **[lows]{.mark}** hit during
London's IE Week [in **February**]{.mark}]{.underline}. StanCharts
points to several catalysts driving the improving mood. First off, [the
**[supply surpluses]{.mark}** the market feared have [yet to]{.mark}
**[materialize]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with the [outlook]{.mark} for Q2
and Q3 [suggesting]{.mark} that **[no surplus]{.mark}** is
**[imminent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In contrast, [oil [markets]{.mark}
could soon be [facing a **deficit**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with StanChart
[predicting that global **[demand]{.mark}** [will **exceed**
**supply**]{.mark} by 0.9 mb/d]{.underline} [[in **Q2**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} by 0.5 mb/d in **[Q[3]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is, however, more
cautious, and sees demand outstripping supply by 0.1 mb/d in Q2 and a
balanced market in Q3. Both the EIA and StanChart have forecast a slight
inventory draw across 2024 and 2025 combined.

Last week, StanChart revealed that [[global]{.mark} oil
**[demand]{.mark}** **[remains robust]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with
demand in January averaging 102.77 million barrels per day (mb/d), good
for a 2.19 mb/d Y/Y increase. StanChart's figure is [based on a variety
of national sources]{.underline} and the 19 March Joint Organisations
Data Initiative (JODI) release. Notably, the estimates from Standard
Chartered align closely with those from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA), which has estimated January oil demand at 102.74
million barrels per day (mb/d), with a growth rate of 1.85 mb/d.
Typically, January marks the seasonal dip in global oil demand. However,
Standard Chartered forecasts [that demand will **surpass** 105.0 mb/d
for the first time in June, **peaking** at a high of 105.6 mb/d in
**August** 2025.]{.underline}

Further, Standard Chartered has predicted that [the dramatic
[**slowdown** in]{.mark} **[U.S]{.mark}**. oil **[production]{.mark}**
growth witnessed in 2024 [will **continue** in]{.mark} **2025** and
**[2026]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

According to the analysts, last year witnessed [a [**sharp slowdown**
in]{.mark} **[non-OPEC]{.mark}**+ **[supply]{.mark}** growth
from]{.underline} 2.46 mb/d in 2023 to 0.79 mb/d in 2024, [primarily
caused by a reduction in U.S. total liquids growth]{.underline} from
1.605 mb/d in 2023 to 734 kb/d in 2024. StanChart [expects this trend to
**[continue]{.mark}**, with U.S. liquids growth expected to]{.underline}
clock in at just 367 kb/d in 2025 before [slowing down]{.underline}
further to 151 kb/d in 2026.

Meanwhile, Europe's gas prices have pulled back to around €41/MWh from
February highs near €60/MWh as traders shift focus to stockpiling for
next winter. Gas price volatility remains high, with the price
trajectory broadly sideways. Front-month TTF has mostly moved into the
EUR 41.95-42.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) range over the past 10 trading
days. EU gas inventories stood at 39.81 billion cubic metres (bcm) on 23
March, good for a y/y fall of 29.33 bcm and 12.54 bcm below the
five-year average. Storage levels remain below 34% of full capacity,
keeping supply risks in focus.

#### Trump sanctions [surge]{.underline} prices, [outweighs]{.underline} their scenarios.

Prices Set to Extend Winning Streak on U.S. Sanction Action," Oil Price,

Crude [[oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark} were [[on course for]{.mark}
their **[third weekly rise]{.mark}** as [concern]{.mark} [grew]{.mark}
[about **supply** after]{.mark}]{.underline} President [[Trump]{.mark}
threatened **25% [tariffs]{.mark}** [on]{.mark}]{.underline} [any
country buying [**Venezuelan** crude]{.mark}]{.underline} [[while
stepping up]{.mark} [sanctions on **Iran**]{.mark}]{.underline}ian
entities.

At the time of writing, [**Brent** crude]{.underline} was trading at
\$73.91 per barrel while [**W**est **T**exas
**I**ntermediate]{.underline} was changing hands for \$69.80 per barrel,
both [set to end the week about **\$1 per barrel** **higher** than they
started it]{.underline}.

"[[The]{.mark} potential [loss of **Venezuelan** crude]{.mark}
exports]{.underline} to the market due to secondary tariffs
[[and]{.mark} the possibility of the same being imposed on
**[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}ian barrels [[has]{.mark} [caused]{.mark}
an apparent [**tightness** in]{.mark} crude
**[supply]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Sparta Commodities analyst June Goh
told Reuters.

On Monday, President Trump said in an executive order that "On or after
April 2, 2025, a tariff of 25 percent may be imposed on all goods
imported into the United States from any country that imports Venezuelan
oil, whether directly from Venezuela or indirectly through third
parties."

[This [caught]{.mark} many [traders and refiners **off
guard**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[especially in **China**]{.mark}, which
is [the **biggest buyer** of]{.mark} **[Venezuelan]{.mark}**
crude]{.underline}. [It is also the **biggest buyer** of [**Iranian**
crude]{.mark}]{.underline}, which also came under attack from the Trump
administration as soon as this administration took office.

Energy consultancy Rystad Energy recently warned in a report that the
Iranian [[sanction]{.mark} push could]{.underline} have a destabilizing
effect on global oil markets and **[[push prices
higher]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Noting that "[**almost all** Iranian
crude exports make their way to China]{.underline}, so achieving
effective maximum pressure would require cooperation from the Chinese
government," Rystad went on to point out that it was Chinese refiners
that turned into a U.S. sanction target earlier this year.

"There have been fundamental justifications for the recent bounce in
oil, yet one cannot help but conclude that it is the [**[US]{.mark}**
trade **[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [will be the
**[ultimate]{.mark}** and anxious [judge of]{.mark} [the direction
of]{.mark} the next \$10 to **[\$15-a-barrel
move]{.mark}**]{.underline}," PVM analyst Tamas Varga told Bloomberg.

### UQ\-\--AT: Glut\-\--2NC

#### No glut, the baby doesn't feel like drilling.

**Mojica 2-11**, \*MA, Environment and Nature, National University of
Colombia, Journalist, Clean Technia, (Juan Diego Celemín, February 11,
2025, "Trump Promised to 'Drill, Baby, Drill.' Big Oil Won't Let Him.,"
*Clean Technia*,
https://cleantechnica.com/2025/02/11/trump-promised-to-drill-baby-drill-big-oil-wont-let-him/)

The promise was simple. All those pesky
[**[reg]{.mark}**ulation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[limitations]{.underline}**, and outright **[bans]{.underline}** that
were [imposed on fossil]{.underline} fuel companies would be
[[lifted]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the **mighty pen** of]{.underline}
President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, allowing them to finally
produce as much as they materially could --- environment be damned ---
and, by virtue of increased supply, bring the price down to guarantee
cheap gasoline for all Americans.

In theory, it was a sound proposal. As oil demand falters in several
large markets, most important of all China, and new streams of
production came from the Americas, [an oil **[glut]{.mark}** was
[expected]{.mark} for **2025**]{.underline}, bringing prices down,
perhaps below \$70 for the first time since the pandemic. Add to that
the unleashing of the US's oil giants and prices could've fallen to
levels not seen since the pandemic, or, prior to that, since the price
war launched by the Saudis in 2014. But it seems [the [realities]{.mark}
on the ground were [far different]{.mark} from what Trump
expected]{.underline}, and [his promises of "unleashing America's
energy" **will not go too far**]{.underline} ... and the fault lies
within Big Oil.

Realities on the ground

Several [oil]{.underline} and oil-adjacent [outlets have been claiming
that]{.underline}, despite Trump's hopes, [the US's oil & gas
[sector]{.mark} is [showing **impressive restraint**]{.mark}, with
companies focusing on consolidating their production, improving their
cost structure, and returning money to investors.]{.underline}
"**[[Drill, baby, drill]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [seems to have been [the
motto for]{.mark} the [2010s]{.mark}, but in the 20[20s]{.mark} the
[industry]{.mark} has **[consolidated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [most
[**accessible** fields]{.mark} seem to already be
**[depleted]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and the [companies]{.mark} that
still operate have [learned]{.mark} the **painful [lessons]{.mark}**
[from]{.mark} the **[price wars]{.mark}** of the 2010s]{.underline}. [As
a result]{.underline}, [oil]{.underline} **[production]{.underline}**,
which grew [in the US]{.underline} by nearly a million barrels a day in
2024, [is expected to grow by a **mere** 300,000 in 2025.]{.underline}

The message that oil executives have been presenting is clear:
"[[we]{.mark} will [drill]{.mark} more ... [if the price is
right]{.mark}]{.underline}." [But **[the price is not]{.mark}
right**]{.underline}, and [[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} prices [[would need
to reach **\$80 or more**]{.underline}]{.mark}, it seems, before the
US's energy giants decided it's time to start reinvesting their
significant profits into extracting more oil.

As a note, if the prices do get that high and the US's oil is
"unleashed," it would be a pyrrhic victory for Trump, as this would mean
high gasoline prices, defeating the purpose of his policies.

The most quoted reason is [**capital restraint**: [companies]{.mark} [do
not want to **overextend**]{.mark} and find themselves [in a
**vulnerable** position]{.mark} [should]{.mark} [prices]{.mark} go
[lower]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the high costs of shale seem to play a
large part, pointing to a possibility already presented by Michael
Barnard, which is that the [**[extraction]{.mark}** [costs]{.mark} are
so **[high]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [since the cheapest fields have
been **depleted**]{.underline} --- as to threaten the entire industry
should demand growth cease. And if you've read my previous articles,
you'll know I believe that's exactly what will happen.

Trump's remaining options

We're less than a month into Trump's presidency, so things could change,
but the position of oil executives seems to be solid and widespread
throughout the industry --- as an oil magazine put it, "**[the baby does
not feel like drilling]{.underline}**."

This does not mean Trump is yet to fail on his promise of cheap
gasoline. A cluster of factors could bring lower oil prices, including
China's and Europe's demand surprising to the low side (something I
believe likely); Guyana's, Brazil's and Argentina's production rising
faster than expected (something I believe unlikely); Trump messing up
massively and causing a recession to the point oil consumption is
severely affected (something sadly possible); and most dramatic of all,
Trump convincing Prince Mohammed Bin Salman through arguments or force
(probably force) to launch yet another price war (something unthinkable
a month ago yet somehow realistic today).

For now, the market seems to be confident in a relative abundance of
oil, with Russia's and Iran's sanctions barely making a blip on the
price of oil, despite potentially withdrawing as much as 2 million
barrels a day from the market. Prices remain around 70-something dollars
per barrel, and the fact that production won't (or can't) easily rise to
bring them down is a silver lining for our planet, as it makes fossil
fuel energy more expensive, further promoting the transition to clean
energies all over the World.

Trump wanted to "Unleash American Energy," but it seems that [[even if
he]{.mark} succeeds in [bringing down]{.mark} **gas**oline
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[he'll]{.mark} only manage to
[make]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [US]{.mark} **hopelessly [dependent]{.mark}**
[on **Middle East oil**]{.mark} yet again]{.underline}, choosing to go
the way of the dinosaur instead of embracing the cluster of renewable
industries left by his predecessor. Hopefully, US states will be able to
resist his call and maintain a strong US renewables industry to cover
the windfall when his plans inevitably backfire.

What factors will affect China's crude oil imports and refining this
year?

[[We **forecast**]{.mark} petroleum **[consumption]{.mark}** [in

expect growth in China's [consumption will **outpace**]{.mark} China's
[domestic **production**]{.mark} of crude oil]{.underline} and other
liquids, we believe [net [**imports** will
**increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last summer, we released a study on
refinery capacity expansions in China and other countries through 2028.
[Several integrated **[refining]{.mark}** [and **petrochemical**]{.mark}
complexe[s]{.mark} [will **open** or **expand**]{.mark} over the next
few years, [suggesting]{.mark} crude oil **[imports]{.mark}**
[will]{.mark} [continue **growing** to meet]{.mark} **feedstock

fuels in China has reached a plateau," *International Energy Agency*,
https://www.iea.org/commentaries/oil-demand-for-fuels-in-china-has-reached-a-plateau)

As the Chinese economy and domestic transport sector undergo significant
transformations, [**[demand]{.mark}** for the most widely consumed
oil-based fuels]{.underline} -- including gasoline, jet fuel and diesel
-- **[[declined marginally]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 2024. What's more,
China's combined consumption of these fuels of almost 8.1 million
barrels per day (mb/d) was 2.5% below 2021 levels and only narrowly
above those in 2019.

[[With]{.mark} the overall [Chinese economy **pivoting** from
**manufacturing** to **services**]{.mark}**-based** growth]{.underline}
and as the adoption of electric vehicles expands in the transport
sector, [the data strongly suggest that the combustion uses of
[petroleum fuel]{.mark} in China have already [reached a
**plateau**]{.mark}]{.underline} and that the potential for future
growth may be very limited.

[**[Overall]{.mark}** Chinese **[oil demand]{.mark}** [continues to
**increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with growth [dominated by
**petrochemical feedstocks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which are converted
into **plastics** and **fibres**]{.underline} rather than burnt as
fuels. [[Oil demand for petrochemicals]{.underline}]{.mark} in China
[**[rose]{.mark}** by almost **[5%]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2024 as new
plants came online, [a trend that is [expected]{.mark} [to
**continue**]{.mark} in the next few years.]{.underline} However, while
China was responsible for more than 60% of global increase in overall
oil demand between 2013 and 2023, it represented less than 20% of last
year's rise, largely as a result of its slowdown in fuel use.

CALGARY --- [[After]{.underline}]{.mark} a catastrophic oil price
collapse blew a hole in their balance sheets in
**[[2015]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[Canadian]{.mark} oilsands [producers
embarked on]{.mark} a decade of **[cost-cutting]{.mark}** to streamline
their operations.]{.underline}

[[Those efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}, made largely below the public
radar, [**[lowered]{.mark}** the industry's **[production
costs]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the last five years, analysts say---a
development that could complicate U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts
to replace Canadian oil with domestic supply as he pushes for U.S.
energy independence.

Talking Points

Canadian oilsands companies have spent the last decade driving down
costs

Those efforts, which started to bear fruit in the last five years, could
be pivotal as Trump looks to slap tariffs on Canadian crude and boost
U.S. oil production

Long considered among the costliest sources of crude, [[Canadian
heavy-oil producers have narrowed the gap]{.mark} with their American
rivals.]{.underline} That will step up the challenge facing Trump as he
threatens to slap a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian oil imports and boost
domestic fossil fuel production.

"[We are not the expensive producer anymore, we're the cheap
producer]{.underline}," said Heather Exner-Pirot, an energy policy
advisor at the Business Council of Canada and senior fellow at the
Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

A recent Scotiabank report estimated that [[Canadian producers on
average could break even and maintain dividends with an oil price
of]{.mark} US\$[50 per barrel]{.mark}]{.underline}, well **[[below the
current price]{.underline}]{.mark}** of around US\$75. Unconventional
oil producers like hydraulic fracturing companies are responsible for
the majority of American supply. Those firms require an oil price
between US\$60 and US\$70 to justify drilling new wells and maintaining
production levels, according to some estimates

3.4 The Persistence of Oil Dominance

The Russian war in Ukraine also affected EU-Russia oil trade and Russian
oil imports. Rather than Russia withholding supplies and the EU putting
in place measures to substitute Russian energy flows, as in the case of
gas, the EU was only able to intervene in the global oil market by means
of setting [[a price cap]{.underline}]{.mark} of \$60 per barrel for
purchases of Russian oil. [The impact of this measure]{.underline},
however, [[is **minimal**]{.underline}]{.mark} for several reasons.
First, [in many cases oil is sold many times over, so it is not clear
whether the oil consumed is of Russian origin]{.underline} or not.
Second, [Russian [exports can **still be profitable**]{.mark} with this
price cap]{.underline}. Third, and most importantly, [[Russia has been
able to]{.mark} largely **[circumvent]{.mark}** the measure [by]{.mark}
means of **employing [a ghost fleet]{.mark}** to carry its oil to
European markets]{.underline}, essentially undercutting the price cap
(Wilson & Cook, 2023). Hence, one can conclude that [EU regulatory power
**lacks teeth**]{.underline} in this case [with the effect that Russian
[oil revenues have **not been hit hard**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [It
is [**only** a **drastic reduction of oil demand**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the European market [that [will **inflict damage** to the]{.mark}
**Russian [budget]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[as a result of a **shrinking
oil pie** and **more intense competition**]{.mark} [that
may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[**bring prices down**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[squeeze margins]{.mark} of profits
[for exporters]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bordoff & O\'Sullivan, 2022a).
[This [demand reduction would **also affect**]{.mark}]{.underline} EU
oil imports from [Nigeria, Iraq, Kazakhstan,

3.4 The Persistence of Oil Dominance

The Russian war in Ukraine also affected EU-Russia oil trade and Russian
oil imports. Rather than Russia withholding supplies and the EU putting
in place measures to substitute Russian energy flows, as in the case of
gas, the EU was only able to intervene in the global oil market by means
of setting [[a price cap]{.underline}]{.mark} of \$60 per barrel for
purchases of Russian oil. [The impact of this measure]{.underline},
however, [[is **minimal**]{.underline}]{.mark} for several reasons.
First, [in many cases oil is sold many times over, so it is not clear
whether the oil consumed is of Russian origin]{.underline} or not.
Second, [Russian [exports can **still be profitable**]{.mark} with this
price cap]{.underline}. Third, and most importantly, [[Russia has been
able to]{.mark} largely **[circumvent]{.mark}** the measure [by]{.mark}
means of **employing [a ghost fleet]{.mark}** to carry its oil to
European markets]{.underline}, essentially undercutting the price cap
(Wilson & Cook, 2023). Hence, one can conclude that [EU regulatory power
**lacks teeth**]{.underline} in this case [with the effect that Russian
[oil revenues have **not been hit hard**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [It
is [**only** a **drastic reduction of oil demand**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the European market [that [will **inflict damage** to the]{.mark}
**Russian [budget]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[as a result of a **shrinking
oil pie** and **more intense competition**]{.mark} [that
may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[**bring prices down**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[squeeze margins]{.mark} of profits
[for exporters]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bordoff & O\'Sullivan, 2022a).
[This [demand reduction would **also affect**]{.mark}]{.underline} EU
oil imports from [Nigeria, Iraq, Kazakhstan,
**[Saudi]{.mark}**]{.underline} Arabia, Azerbaijan [and
Norway]{.underline} (Giuli & Oberthür, 2023b: 406). More generally, [as

[[Problems with **transforming**]{.underline}]{.mark} the

overall **[performance]{.mark}**]{.underline} of electric cars remain
interconnected issues, the advent of which [[will **determine the extent
of change** in]{.mark} the [transport]{.mark} sector]{.underline} and
its impact on overall emissions (EyI-Mazzega & Mathieu, 2020). Since the
transport sector accounts for around one quarter of total EU emissions,
lack of progress in this field jeopardizes the advent of the EU energy
transition.

### L\-\--Renewables\-\--1NC

#### Successful renewable transition devastates rents of fossil fuel exporters

Implications for Fossil Fuel-Rich Developing Countries," Oxford Centre

[Keeping]{.underline} two thirds of [reserves in the ground necessitates
[a significant reduction in the world's use of fossil fuels]{.mark}.
This]{.underline}, in turn, [necessitates a long-term decline in the
demand for fossil fuels, which [could occur **if**]{.mark} governments
impose carbon taxes or similar policies]{.underline}; if **[[there is a
broad transition to alternative energy supplies, such as nuclear or
renewables]{.underline}]{.mark}**; or if economic activity becomes
significantly more efficient in using energy. [Reserves]{.underline} may
also [remain undeveloped if governments impose policies to limit the
market supply of fossil fuel resources]{.underline}. 5 [[A fall in
fossil fuel demand]{.underline}]{.mark}, other things equal, [[will lead
to a fall in fossil fuel prices]{.mark}. [This might lead to existing
reserves]{.mark} remaining undeveloped or **['stranded]{.mark}**'.
Meanwhile [projects that remain commercially viable will be less
valuable. This in turn may **diminish**]{.mark} the **[rents]{.mark}**
and therefore tax revenues fossil fuel extraction can generate for
producing countries]{.underline}. To understand this,
[consider]{.underline} an example from [the global oil
market]{.underline}. The price received for a barrel of oil is roughly
the same for all projects after accounting for relatively small
differences in the quality of oil (such as viscosity) and transport
costs. However, costs will differ considerably across location and
geology. Figure 2 shows a representative global supply curve that ranks
all oil projects from least to most expensive in terms of unit costs of
production. For any given market price, lower cost projects, on the left
part of the supply curve, will have a higher asset value per barrel than
high cost projects. [If the]{.underline} producer [price falls, say in
response to a climate policy, some projects]{.underline} with costs
higher than the prevailing price [will become stranded]{.underline},
while some [**[value]{.mark}** of]{.underline} all remaining operating
[projects **[will be foregone]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Asset stranding
and significant falls in values in the fossil fuel industry are not new,
the recent commodity price slump has stranded many projects already and
fossil fuel companies have seen the value of their assets reduced by
many millions of dollars. However, [the scale of such an outcome
under]{.underline}, for example, [an effective global climate policy
would be entirely new]{.underline}. [It would]{.underline} also [imply a
permanence not normally considered during commodity price
slumps]{.underline}. For example, figure 3 shows estimates of the
proportion of reserves already discovered that could become permanently
stranded if the world keeps to its carbon budget.

### L\-\--SAFs\-\--1NC

#### SAFs are the [lynchpin]{.underline} of the green transition. Scaling them displaces [oil]{.underline} in every other [hard-to-decarbonize sector]{.underline}. 

**Thomsen 24**, \*PhD, International Economics, Graduate Institute of
International Studies, Geneva, Switzerland, (\*Marie Owens, December 10,
2024, \"Disappointingly Slow Growth in SAF Production,\" *International
Air Transport Association*,
https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2024-releases/2024-12-10-03/)

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new
estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2024, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion
liters), double the 0.5 million tonnes (600 million liters) produced in
2023. SAF accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of
global renewable fuel\*.

This is significantly below previous estimates that projected SAF
production in 2024 at 1.5 million tonnes (1.9 billion liters), as key
SAF production facilities in the US have pushed back their production
ramp up to the first half of 2025.

In 2025, SAF production is expected to reach 2.1 million tonnes (2.7
billion liters) or 0.7% of total jet fuel production and 13% of global
renewable fuel capacity\*.

"[SAF volumes are **increasing**, but **disappointingly
slowly**]{.underline}. Governments are sending mixed signals to oil
companies which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and
production of fossil oil and gas. And investors in new generation fuel
producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going
full throttle. With airlines, the core of the value chain, earning just
a 3.6% net margin, profitability expectations for SAF investors need to
be slow and steady, not fast and furious. But make no mistake that
airlines are eager to buy SAF and there is money to be made by investors
and companies who see the long-term future of decarbonization.
[Governments can accelerate progress by winding down fossil fuel
production **subsidies** and replacing them with strategic **production
incentives** and **clear policies** supporting a future built on
renewable energies, including SAF]{.underline}," said Willie Walsh,
IATA's Director General.

[[Aviation is part of]{.mark} the **[global]{.mark}** energy
**[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"[The [airline]{.mark} industry's **[decarbonization]{.mark}** [must be
seen as part of the **global**]{.mark} energy **[transition]{.mark}**,
[not **compartmentalized**]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a **[transport]{.mark}
issue**]{.underline}. That's because [[solving]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
energy [transition challenge for aviation will]{.mark} also
**[benefit]{.mark}** [the **wider economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as
[renewable]{.mark} fuel [refineries]{.mark} [will produce a **broad
range** of fuels]{.mark} [used by other industries]{.mark}, and [only a
minor share will be **SAF**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [used by
airlines]{.underline}. We need the whole world to produce as much
renewable energy as possible for everybody. Airlines simply want to
access their fair share of that output," said Marie Owens Thomsen,
IATA's Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

To reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, IATA analysis shows that
between 3,000 to over 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be needed.
[These will also produce **renewable diesel** and other fuels for other
industries.]{.underline} The annual average capex needed to build the
new facilities over the 30-year period is about \$128 billion per year,
in a best-case scenario. Importantly, this amount is significantly less
than the estimated total sum of investments in the solar and wind energy
markets at \$280 billion per annum between 2004 and 2022.

"Governments must quickly deliver concrete policy incentives to rapidly
accelerate renewable energy production. There is already a model to
follow with the transition to wind and solar power. The good news is
that the energy transition, which includes SAF, will need less than half
the annual investments that realizing wind and solar production at scale
required. And a good portion of the needed funding could be realized by
redirecting a portion of the retrograde subsidies that governments give
to the fossil fuel industry," said Walsh.

4.1 Race to Sell Oil

[[In response to]{.mark} the threat of **[peak]{.mark} oil
[demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[producer countries could]{.mark}
[**battle it out**,]{.mark} fight for market share,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} try to [**[sell]{.mark} as much** of [their
oil]{.mark} now **[before demand declines]{.mark}** as a result of a
switch to **clean**]{.underline}er **[energy]{.underline}** sources.
[[This is a strategy]{.mark} that **low-cost producers** like
**[Saudi]{.mark}**]{.underline} Arabia [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} be
tempted to [[pursue]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, in March 2020, the
Saudi Ministry of Energy instructed Saudi Aramco to increase its
production capacity from 12 to 13 mb/d (Saudi Aramco, 2020). [Saudi
Aramco's]{.underline} April 2019 [bond prospectus]{.underline}, released
ahead of its initial public offering, [reads like a strategy to be
the]{.underline} "[last man standing]{.underline}" [in the oil
market]{.underline} (Krane, 2021). Similarly, the United Arab Emirates'
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) had plans to increase its
production capacity to 5 mb/d, up from 3.1 mb/d in October 2018 (Kerr,
2018).

The idea here is that [[**climate policy** and the **anticipated
depreciation** of reserves]{.underline} [**undermines** incentives to
**leave oil in the ground**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, instead [provoking
a]{.mark} "**[panic and pump]{.mark}**" **[strategy]{.mark}** to
monetize as much of those reserves **before** the window
closes]{.underline}. It is also built on a belief that [oil will
**remain indispensable** for some time to come, and that NOCs may be at
an advantage compared to international oil co]{.underline}mpanies, which
face mounting pressure from shareholders, courts, and public opinion.
However, by [rushing to develop reserves and make the most out of what
could be the last oil boom, [**price wars** may
**erupt**]{.mark}]{.underline} between oil exporters, thus
[**[depressing prices]{.mark}** and revenues for all. [It could lead
to]{.mark} "**[green paradox]{.mark}**" **[effects]{.mark}**,
[where]{.mark}by [lower oil prices **slow**]{.mark}]{.underline} down
**[[the]{.mark} energy [transition]{.mark}]{.underline}** itself (Sinn,
2012). Moreover, [rapacious oil extraction is a short-term strategy
which does not improve long-term prospects for growth]{.underline} (van

The second main finding from researchers is that [[a]{.mark} low carbon
[transition **consistent with**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark}** Agreement [[would use **much less
oil**]{.mark},]{.underline} potentially [[affecting]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [global [demand for]{.mark} crude derived from the **[oil
sands]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Harvey 2017; Jaccard et al. 2018). [[Since
lower]{.mark} oil [demand could be met by]{.mark} other, [less
GHG-intensive oil sources]{.mark} -- and at a lower cost -- [the oil
sands are]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best, an economically
[[inefficient]{.underline}]{.mark} way of producing oil. More
critically, a [[decline in oil demand could leave]{.mark} the [oil

investors]{.underline}]{.mark} and communities [[at risk]{.mark} of

Canada's]{.mark} oil [reserves would remain underground in a

oil sands projects would proceed in this scenario]{.underline} (McGlade

is not ready for a collapse of the oil sands,\" CCPA,

[[There is a]{.underline}]{.mark} real and growing
**[[possibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [**[demand for Canadian
oil]{.mark}** exports [will fall **sooner**]{.mark} and faster **than
anticipated**]{.underline}. Not only because of falling demand for oil
in general, but specifically because the oil sands are among the
costliest and most emissions intensive sources of oil in the world.

[No Canadian politician]{.underline} or government [can save the oil
sands **[if]{.mark}** **[international demand]{.mark}** for that dirty
fuel **[dries up]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

As new research from the CCPA and Ecojustice explains, [[**falling
demand** for]{.mark} oil sands [**exports** would be
**devastating**]{.mark} for the Alberta]{.underline}n workers,
communities and governments that have no plans in place for this
possible future.

Heads in the Sands, co-authored by myself and Ecojustice lawyer Matt
Hulse, presents [an economic model of the oil sands in a global
**[net-zero]{.mark}** scenario. It [paints an **ugly picture**]{.mark}
for the industry]{.underline}. Production from the oil sands stays
relatively steady for the next few years before collapsing in the 2030s
and falling more than 80 per cent by 2050. [A production decline driven
by changes in global demand would have far greater consequences than any
domestic policy to reduce emissions from the oil sands.]{.underline}

[In **this scenario**, **[oil sands]{.mark}** projects **[fall like
dominoes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, starting with the highest-cost and
highest-emitting producers in the 2030s. By 2050, only a handful of
projects are still producing and at well below their maximum productive
capacity.

Total [[employment]{.underline}]{.mark} in the sector
[[falls]{.underline}]{.mark} by **[[90 per cent]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in this period. Royalty and [tax payments]{.underline} generated by the
industry [fall even faster, **[blowing a huge hole in the]{.mark}
provincial [budget]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Shuttered projects leave
behind \$[[**70 billion** in stranded assets and]{.underline}]{.mark}
more than \$[[**50 billion** in]{.mark} unfunded environmental
**[cleanup]{.mark}** costs]{.underline}. All of these figures are broken
down in more detail in the report.

It's a fate Alberta is unsurprisingly unwilling to entertain, and oil
backers will be quick to dismiss this scenario as unlikely or even
impossible. What are the odds the whole international community follows
through on their climate commitments?

Think about it this way. If [**[stable]{.mark}** oil
**[demand]{.mark}**]{.underline} through 2050 [[is the **best
case**]{.mark} scenario]{.underline} for the Canadian oil sands, then
**[[rapid decarb]{.underline}]{.mark}**onization **[[is the
worst]{.mark} case scenario]{.underline}**. If reality falls anywhere in
the middle, Alberta needs to be prepared for at least some oil sands
projects to shut down prematurely. And [if reality falls closer to the
worst case scenario---which]{.underline}, to be clear, [is]{.underline}
absolutely [essential from a climate perspective]{.underline}---then
[Alberta needs to be prepared for]{.underline} a [deep and sustained
economic disruption]{.underline} as early as the 2030s.

[[The **Potential** Impact of EVs]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Global Oil
Market

Forecasting based on alternative scenarios suggests that our projections
will most likely fall between the reference and high-case scenarios.
Given this, the ascendancy of the EV industry seems poised to command a
significant portion of the future internal combustion engine (ICE)
market.

Considering the ever-changing landscape of both the oil and automotive
industries, it\'s prudent to reassess our assumptions every five years.
Factors like updated data, evolving consumer preferences, and automotive
industry strategies should be weighed in these evaluations.

Looking towards 2040, one pivotal question emerges: How will the
projected penetration of EVs and consequent fuel displacement impact the
global oil sector? [[If fuel displacement aligns with our]{.mark}
reference to **[high-case scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[it could
**ring alarm bells** for]{.underline}]{.mark} the global **[[oil and
gas]{.underline}]{.mark}** industry. This is [**[especially]{.mark}**
true [for nations **heavily reliant on oil export**]{.mark}]{.underline}
revenue[**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[While these analyses serve as **[early warnings]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[they **also** [offer the]{.mark} oil [industry]{.mark} ample time [to
strategize]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[By 2040, even **with** the rise of
EVs]{.mark}, global [oil demand **may** **still** hover
between]{.mark}]{.underline} 65-**[[78 MMBD]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a
decline from 100 MMBD in 2022. As a result, [[**intense competition**
for market share might lead to **price wars**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
such scenarios, ICE vehicle owners and other industrial consumers stand
to benefit the most.

up**]{.mark} in the coming years]{.underline}.

Stricter emissions regulations on gas cars will bring oil demand down
further. The European Union's strengthened standards require emissions
for new cars to be 50 percent lower in 2030 than they were in 2021. In
the U.S., [**[strengthened]{.mark}** efficiency **[rules]{.mark}** for
cars [are projected to]{.mark} [**halve emissions** from]{.mark}
light-duty [vehicles]{.mark} within the next decade, due to higher
uptake of both EVs and hybrid vehicles.]{.underline}

Though growth in oil demand may soon disappear, that doesn't mean oil
use will drop off. According to the IEA's estimates, the world will
still be using too much oil to be on track for climate targets by 2030
--- even though EVs are expected to displace millions of barrels of oil
per day by then.

To reach the Paris Agreement net-zero emissions goals, oil and gas use
will need to decline by more than 75 percent by 2050. In other words,
oil demand will need to not only plateau but fall significantly.

recently announced decisions to **[scale back]{.mark}** their EV

In the UK, the picture is mixed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT) reported a record 56,300 electric cars sold in September,
but EVs still accounted for only 20.5% of total vehicle sales.
[Automakers [remain **concerned** about **meeting**]{.mark}
the]{.underline} UK's Zero [**[E]{.mark}**mission **[V]{.mark}**ehicle

### L\-\--Generic\-\--Batteries\-\--2NC

#### The plan's battery innovation unlocks the [biggest barrier]{.underline} to renewables, [intermittency]{.underline}. Those [outcompete]{.underline} even the [cheapest]{.underline} fossil fuels.

**IEA 24**, (International Energy Agency, April 25, 2024, "Rapid
expansion of batteries will be crucial to meet climate and energy
security goals set at COP28,"
https://www.iea.org/news/rapid-expansion-of-batteries-will-be-crucial-to-meet-climate-and-energy-security-goals-set-at-cop28)

After their deployment in the power sector more than doubled last year,
[[batteries]{.mark} [need]{.mark} to lead [a **sixfold
increase**]{.mark} in global energy storage [to]{.mark} enable the world
to [meet **2030** **targets**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Growth]{.mark} in batteries **[outpaced]{.mark}** almost **[all
other]{.mark}** [clean]{.mark}]{.underline} energy
[[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} 2023 as
**[[falling costs]{.mark},]{.underline}** advancing innovation and
supportive industrial policies helped drive up demand for [a technology
that will be **critical** to delivering the climate and energy
targets]{.underline} outlined at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai,
according to a new IEA report.

In the first comprehensive analysis of the entire battery ecosystem, the
IEA's Special Report on Batteries and Secure Energy Transitions sets out
the role that [[batteries]{.underline}]{.mark} can play alongside
renewables as a competitive, [**[secure]{.mark}** and sustainable
[alternative to]{.mark} electricity generation from **[fossil]{.mark}
fuels**]{.underline} -- [[while]{.mark} also **[underpinning]{.mark}**
the [**decarbonisation** of **road**]{.mark} [transport]{.mark} by
powering **e**lectric **v**ehicles.]{.underline}

In less than 15 years, battery costs have fallen by more than 90%, one
of the fastest declines ever seen in clean energy technologies. The most
common type of batteries, those based on lithium-ion, have typically
been associated with consumer electronics. But today, [the energy sector
accounts for over **90%** of overall battery **demand**]{.underline}. In
2023 alone, battery deployment in the power sector increased by more
than 130% year-on-year, adding a total of 42 gigawatts (GW) to
electricity systems around the world. In the transport sector,
[batteries have **[enabled]{.mark}** [**electric car** sales to
**surge**]{.mark} from 3 million]{.underline} in 2020 [to almost 14
million last year]{.underline}, with further strong growth expected in
the coming years.

"[The **electricity** and **transport** sectors are two key pillars for
bringing down emissions]{.underline} quickly enough to meet the targets
agreed at COP28 and keep open the possibility of limiting global warming
to 1.5 °C," said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.
"[**[Batteries]{.mark}** will [provide]{.mark} the
**[foundations]{.mark}** in both areas, playing [an **invaluable role**
in **scaling up** renewables]{.mark} and electrifying transport while
delivering **secure** and sustainable **energy** for businesses and
households]{.underline}. [The **[combination]{.mark}** [of
**solar**]{.mark} PV [and **batteries** is]{.mark} today
[**competitive** with]{.mark} new **[coal]{.mark}** plants]{.underline}
in India. [And]{.underline} just [[in]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[next
few years]{.mark}, [it will be **cheaper** than]{.mark} new **coal** in
China and **[gas]{.mark}**-fired power in the United
States.]{.underline} [Batteries are **[changing the game before our
eyes]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[Battery deployment will need to scale up **significantly**]{.underline}
between now and the end of the decade to enable the world to get on
track for its energy and climate goals, according to the report. In this
scenario, overall energy storage capacity increases sixfold by 2030
worldwide, with batteries accounting for 90% of the increase and pumped
hydropower for most of the rest.

[By enabling **greater shares** of renewables in the power
system]{.underline} and shifting electricity supply to when it's most
needed, [[batteries]{.mark} [will]{.mark} help **advance** **progress**
on the goals set at COP28]{.underline}. These [include
**[tripl]{.mark}**ing renewable energy
**[capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} by 2030, [**[doubling]{.mark}** [the
pace of energy **efficiency** improvements]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[transition]{.mark}ing [away]{.mark}** [from **fossil**]{.mark}
**fuels**]{.underline}. To triple global renewable energy capacity by
2030, 1 500 GW of energy storage, of which 1 200 GW from batteries, will
be required. A shortfall in deploying enough batteries would risk
stalling clean energy transitions in the power sector.

To scale up batteries globally, the report found that costs need to come
down further without compromising quality and technology. Ensuring
energy security also requires greater diversity in supply chains,
including for extracting and processing the critical minerals used in
batteries -- and for manufacturing the batteries themselves. Countries
are already tackling this through ambitious industrial programmes to
support local manufacturing capacity with targeted policies in the
United States, European Union and India among others.

Global battery manufacturing has more than tripled in the last three
years. While China produces most batteries today, the report shows that
40% of announced plans for new battery manufacturing is in advanced
economies such as the United States and the European Union. If all those
projects are built, those economies would have nearly enough
manufacturing to meet their own needs to 2030 on the path to net zero
emissions.

The report highlights the versatility of battery storage to support
electricity security cost-effectively as part of clean energy
transitions. In the power sector, [batteries help **smooth** out the
**variability** of renewable electricity from technologies such as wind
and **solar**]{.underline}. Moreover, [battery storage can **alleviate
grid congestion** in times of **high supply**, offering an **outlet** to
capture and store excess renewable electricity that would otherwise be
lost]{.underline}. And they [provide highly technical services to the
grid, such as **voltage** and **frequency control**, that can help
system operators]{.underline}.

Batteries can also play a vital role in improving access to electricity
for those who still lack it. In a pathway to achieving universal energy
access worldwide by 2030, they help 400 million people in emerging and
developing economies gain electricity access through decentralised
solutions like solar home systems and mini grids with batteries.

#### It makes [deep decarbonization]{.underline} of industry possible. Lithium Ion based [fail]{.underline} in the squo.

**Cunliff 19**, \*PhD, Physics, University of California, Davis,
Director, Strategic Analysis and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Energy,
(\*Colin, Fall 2019, "An Innovation Agenda for Hard-to-Decarbonize
Energy Sectors," *Issues in Science and Technology*, Vol. XXXVI, No. 1,
https://issues.org/an-innovation-agenda-for-hard-to-decarbonize-energy-sectors/)

The energy innovation agenda of the past 10 years has focused, with
considerable success, on reducing the cost and expanding the use of wind
and solar resources for electricity generation. These trends appear
likely to continue. Greater penetration of wind and solar may result in
near-term carbon emissions reductions in the electricity sector (though
their impact could be muted by any loss of carbon-free generation from
closing nuclear plants).

It is now time for policy-makers to expand the clean energy portfolio to
address gaps in the current innovation agenda. In particular, a recent
study published in the journal Science on net-zero emissions energy
systems identified three sources of [**[difficult-to-eliminate]{.mark}**
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} that [will [require **fundamental
breakthroughs**]{.mark} and greater attention from policy-makers as they
seek to develop low-carbon solutions]{.underline}: [firm]{.underline},
**[[dispatchable electricity]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [hard-to-electrify
**[transport]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[and **industrial-sector**]{.mark}
emissions]{.underline}.

[Firm, dispatchable electricity]{.underline}. [As **[costs]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} electricity from [**wind** and
**solar**]{.mark}]{.underline} [are continuing to
**[decline]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [they are [projected to meet]{.mark}
a **[growing share]{.mark}** of electricity demand]{.underline} in the
coming decades. But [[there are **limits**]{.mark} to the amount of
variable **generation** from wind and solar that the grid can
**accommodate**.]{.underline} [Nearly [all **deep decarbonization**
studies]{.mark} [identify]{.mark}]{.underline} [the need]{.underline}
for "firm" low-carbon electricity [to **balance**]{.underline} both
**[[variability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in electricity demand and
variable output from wind and solar. Firm electricity refers to
electricity that can be generated and dispatched as needed in all
seasons and over periods of weeks or longer.

**[[Batteries]{.underline}]{.mark}** combined with variable generation
[may be able to [help **manage**]{.mark} shorter-term
**[imbalances]{.mark}** [on hourly]{.mark} and sub-hourly
[scales]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the present enthusiasm in the climate
and energy communities about systems that combine lithium-ion (Li-ion)
batteries with renewables is understandable. [These batteries can [fill
in **gaps**]{.mark} of up to a few **hours** [when the **sun** is not
**shining** or]{.mark} the [**wind** is not
**blowing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [battery storage
technologies]{.underline} [using]{.underline} current
**[[Li-ion]{.underline}]{.mark}** chemistries [are **[unlikely]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} be able to [manage]{.mark} the [**large weekly** and
**seasonal variations**]{.mark} in generation from wind and
solar]{.underline}. For example, in 2017 California experienced 90 days
with little to no wind, including 10 consecutive days in December when
output from wind turbines was essentially zero. Similarly, the solar
resource in a California winter is on average less than half what it is
in the summer.

Variability on these timescales has traditionally been balanced by
flexible generation from natural gas power plants. However, [**[full
decarbonization]{.mark}** of the electricity system [will]{.mark}
[require]{.mark} low-carbon firm, **[dispatchable electricity]{.mark}**
that can manage variability across all **timescales**, from **hourly**,
to **weekly**, to **seasonal**.]{.underline}

Hydropower plants with high-capacity reservoirs, geothermal power, and
biomass- and biogas-fueled power plants can all provide firm,
dispatchable low-carbon electricity. But hydropower and geothermal are
constrained by geography and have limits on the total capacity that can
be installed with current technologies. And large-scale reliance on
biomass for power generation competes with other land uses, including
agriculture, as well as the use of biomass for fuels in the
transportation and industrial sectors.

[[Maintaining]{.mark} reliable [grid operations will]{.mark}
[require]{.mark} **[new]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [low-carbon suppliers of
firm, **dispatchable electricity**]{.underline}. Options include
[[**long-duration** energy **storage**]{.mark} that can store large
quantities of electricity on weekly and seasonal
timescales]{.underline}; nuclear power plants that are operated
flexibly; and fossil fuel power plants equipped with CCUS technologies.

### L\-\--Generic\-\--Demand Reduction\-\--2NC

#### [Only]{.underline} a [drastic demand reduction]{.underline} squeezes the budget of exporters

3.4 The Persistence of Oil Dominance

The Russian war in Ukraine also affected EU-Russia oil trade and Russian
oil imports. Rather than Russia withholding supplies and the EU putting
in place measures to substitute Russian energy flows, as in the case of
gas, the EU was only able to intervene in the global oil market by means
of setting [[a price cap]{.underline}]{.mark} of \$60 per barrel for
purchases of Russian oil. [The impact of this measure]{.underline},
however, [[is **minimal**]{.underline}]{.mark} for several reasons.
First, [in many cases oil is sold many times over, so it is not clear
whether the oil consumed is of Russian origin]{.underline} or not.
Second, [Russian [exports can **still be profitable**]{.mark} with this
price cap]{.underline}. Third, and most importantly, [[Russia has been
able to]{.mark} largely **[circumvent]{.mark}** the measure [by]{.mark}
means of **employing [a ghost fleet]{.mark}** to carry its oil to
European markets]{.underline}, essentially undercutting the price cap
(Wilson & Cook, 2023). Hence, one can conclude that [EU regulatory power
**lacks teeth**]{.underline} in this case [with the effect that Russian
[oil revenues have **not been hit hard**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [It
is [**only** a **drastic reduction of oil demand**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the European market [that [will **inflict damage** to the]{.mark}
**Russian [budget]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[as a result of a **shrinking
oil pie** and **more intense competition**]{.mark} [that
may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[**bring prices down**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[squeeze margins]{.mark} of profits
[for exporters]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bordoff & O\'Sullivan, 2022a).
[This demand reduction would **also affect**]{.underline} EU oil imports
from [Nigeria, Iraq, Kazakhstan, **Saudi**]{.underline} Arabia,
Azerbaijan [and Norway]{.underline} (Giuli & Oberthür, 2023b: 406). More
generally, [as long as the EU does not move]{.underline} on [decisively
to curb oil demand, it [**provides signals** to fossil exporters of a
resilient]{.mark} global oil [market]{.mark}, not least if one takes
into account]{.underline} the [increasing demand for oil in Asia and the
Global South]{.underline} in general.

Conclusions

[[We provide]{.underline}]{.mark} novel
**[[ev]{.underline}]{.mark}**idence [[of the]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[Green Paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [for climate]{.underline}
change [legislation [using **various**]{.mark}]{.underline} panel
**[[data sets]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We consistently find that
[proposed]{.underline} climate [[bills that
**limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} future [[oil use]{.underline},]{.mark}
**[shift]{.underline}** oil [consumption from the future towards the
present]{.underline}, thereby **[[lower]{.mark}ing oil
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the present and medium-term until the
bills bind. Previous papers on the "Green Paradox" have conducted
pre-post comparisons around the passage or discussion of environmental
regulation to construct evidence of legislation's effect on fossil fuel
prices. Forward-looking futures prices do not respond when laws are
enacted or fail to be enacted, but rather to the release of new
information on whether or not a law will pass. Whether or not a bill
will pass is oftentimes clear long before it is enacted, making bill
passage not a surprise. Moreover, discerning exactly when major market
belief updates occur can be difficult. One of our paper's contributions
is our reliance on daily oil price data and market estimates of the
probability that a bill will pass, insulating us from the difficulty in
determining when the market participants update their beliefs.
Additionally, our reliance on daily variation and use of direct
estimates of market expectations allow us to overcome reverse causality
challenges common in pre-post comparisons. For example, downward trends
in prices can decrease resource owners' resistance towards a law
increasing the likelihood that a bill passes, which would be a concern
in a pre-post analysis but not in our analysis using day-to-day changes.
We get around this challenge by exploiting market estimates of the
probability that the US climate law would pass from prediction markets
with price variation driven by political processes unrelated to daily
changes in oil prices. Moreover, a falsification test where we offset
the prediction market prices by one day yields null results,
highlighting that daily variation drives our results rather than price
level variation across months or quarters.

When markets expect future climate legislation to be more stringent, we
find fossil fuel prices decrease shifting oil consumption from the
future to the present. We are unable to speak to whether [[this]{.mark}
shift [is caused by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[expected
**future**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[climate
[regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[expected **follow on
policies**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or]{.mark} expected **[increased
competition]{.mark}** in fossil fuel markets]{.underline}. Whatever the
channel, we find the anticipation of more stringent future climate
policy, induces more consumption today.

We provide four pieces of evidence that are consistent with the "Green
Paradox" for climate change legislation. First, we document that daily
shocks to the oil spot price (changes relative to the previous day)
historically phase out quickly over time, i.e., maturities further into
the future show less responsiveness to changes in present oil prices.
This is consistent with temporary spot price shocks, e.g., due to
temporary demand spikes (cold winters) or temporary supply disruptions.
However, [during the time period when a US climate bill was deliberated,
the average daily shock]{.underline} in the spot price [became **much
more persistent**]{.underline}, [indicating that [the]{.mark} underlying
[uncertainty was less transitory and more
**fundamental**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Under the "**Green
Paradox**,"]{.underline} [market belief updates around]{.underline}
future [climate policy]{.underline} should [yield **persistent
shocks**]{.underline}, as each belief update the entire price path
resets.

Second, when we link monthly changes in oil futures to changes in the
salience of climate policy in the news, we find a highly significant
negative relationship between the salience of international climate
negotiations and oil futures consistent with a story that
**[[international coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [around climate
change [enforce expectations that]{.mark} climate [policy will be more
stringent]{.mark} moving forward, **[increasing
current]{.mark}**]{.underline} oil
**[[consumption]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Additionally, we find a
significant positive relationship between the salience of renewable
energy policy and oil futures consistent with a story that oil producers
have not viewed advances in renewable policy as threats to future oil
demand but rather as a mechanism reducing threats to future oil demand
as they reduce the likelihood of more stringent climate policy.

Third, [[in]{.mark} what we find to be [our]{.mark} **most [convincing
ev]{.mark}**idence [of a **causal relationship**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[we link]{.mark} daily [changes in oil futures to]{.mark} changes in
[the probability]{.mark} that [the US will pass a climate bill
and]{.mark} [find a **highly significant negative
relationship**]{.mark}]{.underline} consistent with a story that
[legislation limiting future oil use increases current
consumption]{.underline}. This relationship is even more significant and
of higher magnitude when we limit the data to a few dates of key
political events, ruling out reverse causality, as the timing of these
political events was not driven by oil prices. Furthermore, it is
unlikely that there are other persistent demand shocks (e.g., higher
than expected GDP growth) or persistent supply shocks (e.g., new
discoveries) that coincide on exactly the 26 days that major updates on
the bill occurred. By the same token, [the surprise ruling of a Dutch
**Court** that ordered the government to limit fossil fuel use was
associated with a significant negative abnormal oil price
return]{.underline}. Moreover, the verdict release date was
pre-determined and not affected by daily oil price movements, again
ruling out reverse causality. Similarly, [the news that Justice Kennedy,
the swing vote, would support the states suing the EPA to regulate
automobile carbon dioxide emissions was associated with a significant
negative abnormal oil price return]{.underline}.

### L\-\--Generic\-\--Increasing Carbon Tax\-\--2NC

#### An increasing carbon tax causes a [race to the bottom]{.underline} in oil markets

**Canniere 24**, PhD candidate in the Industrial Organization Group at
KU Leuven, Belgium (Charlotte De, 11-22-2024, "Pump it? Market Power and
the Energy Transition in the Global Oil Market," p. 15-16,
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUcyAJij-UZWJKVtANOwPNJ1T6PYrnP-/view)

Second, [carbon taxes also affect the **speed of extraction** in the oil
sector]{.underline}. In the standard Hotelling framework, Dasgupta et
al. (1980) demonstrate that virtually any desired pattern of resource
extraction can be achieved by adjusting the trajectory of (carbon)
taxes. Intuitively, [[if carbon taxes are **expected to rise**]{.mark}
over time, [firms]{.mark} have an **incentive to [accelerate
extraction]{.mark}**[, as future production becomes less
profitable]{.mark}]{.underline}. This highlights the critical role of
expectations regarding taxation in a dynamic context. Analytically,
consider a modification to the equilibrium condition for the cartel to
incorporate time- varying carbon taxes Tt, as shown in Equation 5. When
Tt increases over time, future marginal revenues must rise even faster
to justify delaying extraction. Given the same backstop price, this
necessitates a complete adjustment to both the price and extraction
path.

\[\[EQUATION 5 OMITTED\]\]

This second effect suggests that future [carbon [taxes]{.mark} can
**[unintentionally increase]{.mark}** current
**[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a phenomenon [termed the **Green
Paradox**]{.underline} by Sinn (2008). [Anticipating stricter future
climate policies, resource owners may accelerate the extraction of
resources, leading to a short-term **increase in environmental
damage**]{.underline} from oil production. [As a result, environmental
regulation, intended to reduce emissions, may]{.underline} temporarily
**[have the opposite effect]{.underline}**. The extent and significance
of the Green Paradox depend on several factors, including the type of
environmental policy implemented, extraction costs, demand elasticity,
market conduct, and the distribution of oil reserves, as discussed by
van der Ploeg and Withagen (2012a)

Market power, and the run for the last barrel [[The **cartel** exercises
market power by withholding production]{.mark} capacity]{.underline},
thereby [creating artificial scarcity to elevate prices. [**However**,
in]{.mark} the context of increasingly [**stringent environmental
policies**, this]{.mark} strategy [may be]{.mark}]{.underline}come
**[[less attractive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specifically, [[the
profit]{.mark}ability [of delaying production **diminishes** as]{.mark}
carbon **[taxes rise]{.mark} over time**]{.underline}. In response,
[[the cartel may]{.mark} **shift** its strategy by
**[frontload]{.mark}ing [production]{.mark}** [to earlier
periods]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [reducing the extent to which it
withholds capacity]{.underline}. Given the cartels relatively lower
marginal costs, this frontloading strategy could displace production
from higher-cost fringe producers (Benchekroun et al., 2019).
Consequently, the trajectory of carbon taxes influences not only the
quantity of oil produced but also who produces. [[This
**acceleration**]{.mark} **in production**, aimed at avoiding stranded
assets, [may be]{.mark} likened to [a **race** for the **last barrel of
oil**]{.mark}]{.underline} that remains economically viable to extract.

[The [results we obtain]{.mark}]{.underline} for the NYT-Renewable

[[**breakthrough**, consistent with oil companies deciding to **shift

[competition from]{.mark} the **[renewable]{.mark}**
**[s]{.mark}**ector.]{.underline}

Oil futures prices across all maturities increase on news of higher
future emission costs; as discussed before, this is consistent with the
model in the scenario where some incumbents' assets will be stranded in
the carbon tax scenario. Our model also predicts that oil futures prices
should rise upon news about restrictions in building new capacity. The
observed relationship between oil future prices and innovations in the
NYT-Oil Capacity News Index instead is negative though usually not
statistically significantly so.

Overall, the table shows that, consistent with the predictions of the
model, different types of transition risk can have quite different
effects on oil prices. This highlights the importance of distinguishing
different sources of transition risk.

By contrast, there are demand-driven explanations. It is logical that
people may search for alternative biofuels when faced with high oil
prices, resulting in an increase in the use of agricultural feedstocks,
which are the same materials required to produce biofuels \[14\]. Given
the limited agricultural acreage, the upward shift in biofuel demand
might create an incentive to produce more biomass feedstocks, which in
turn might lead to other agricultural commodities used for food being
disregarded by farmers, and, as a result, reinforce the price volatility
in the agricultural market \[29\], \[14\]. Using co-integration
analysis, Ciaian and Kancs \[7\] found that [the relationship between
**oil** and **food prices** is more likely to be affected by **biofuel**
prices than the cost of **production**]{.underline}. It has been argued
that biofuel development is perhaps the main reason behind the increase
in agricultural product prices \[25\], \[20\]. In other words[, the
[**introduction** of **biofuels**]{.mark}, which helps
**[reduce]{.mark}** U.S. [**dependence** on imported]{.mark} crude
**[oil]{.mark}**]{.underline}, has strengthened linkages between fuel
and the food market. Mitchell \[25\] contended that the increase in food
prices was 70--75% linked to the increase in biofuel production, as
confirmed by supporting data gathered between 2002 and 2008. Chen et al.
\[6\] found that the growth of corn- and soybean-based biofuels boosted
agricultural food prices, according to data gathered over the 1983--2008
period. On the other hand, Lazear \[19\] asserted that crops used for
biofuel production are only responsible for a small portion of the total
food price. Similarly, Mueller \[26\] inferred that the influence of
biofuel production on increasing food prices ranged from approximately
3%--30%. This implies that the magnitude of the increase in biofuel
production and its effects on food prices is an interesting topic to
investigate.

However, [**[without biofuel]{.mark}** development]{.underline}, [[oil
prices would have **increased**]{.mark} even more]{.underline} \[20\].
The findings show that [a mixture of 90% gasoline and 10%
[ethanol]{.mark} would have [lowered]{.mark} the [prices]{.mark} of
gasoline [by]{.mark}]{.underline} between \$0.19 and
**[[\$0.50]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[27\]. Du and Hayes \[10\] found that
bioethanol production reduced gasoline prices by an average of \$0.29
per gallon from 2000 to 2011 in the U.S., whereas the Midwest region of
the country appeared to be the most highly affected. Based on their
study, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[substantial reduction]{.mark}** in
gasoline prices was found in terms of the highest amount of **ethanol**
production]{.underline}. Similarly, according to the Renewable Fuels
Association \[36\], the price of gasoline is affected by the production
of bioethanol, effectively reducing gasoline prices to a range of
\$0.5--\$1.5 per gallon. The study also shows that [crude oil [prices
would be]{.mark} approximately]{.underline} \$15[--**[\$40 a barrel
higher]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[if there were no **bioethanol**]{.mark}
production additives]{.underline}. It is because [the price impact of
[bioethanol]{.mark} use can be [regarded as a **positive shock**
to]{.mark} the gasoline **[supply]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[23\]. Not
only do high oil prices breach a threshold level, making ethanol
competitive with crude oil, but they also generate normal market
conditions within the corn market \[28\]. Due to the linkages between
agricultural commodities and bioenergy, bioethanol production might
eventually become a tool used to stabilize corn prices. Natanelov et al.
\[29\] found that corn prices would be stabilized by bioethanol
production in relation to crude oil prices when crude oil prices were
maintained at a threshold level of \$75 per barrel in the U.S.

The Impacts of Oil and Gas Deindustrialization

[Declining Canadian competitiveness in]{.underline} the [oil and
gas]{.underline} industry [could have significant negative impacts on
Canada from **rising**]{.underline} regional
**[unemployment]{.underline}**, the [loss of important **tax
revenues**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [collapse of economic
interlinkages]{.underline}. Regional deindustrialization is not a new
phenomenon in Canada. Manufacturing played a major role in Canada's
economy throughout the 20th century, concentrated in Southern Ontario.
In parallel with the decline of the Steel Belt in the United States,
Canadian manufacturing declined as the share of the economy from the
1960s onward.

The manufacturing share of employment in Ontario dropped from a peak of
nearly 25 per cent in 1979 to just 10 per cent today. The
deindustrialization of Ontario and the broader Great Lakes region is
thought to have been caused by declining competitiveness in major
industries such as steel, cars, and rubber. Manufacturing industries in
the Great Lakes region faced high energy and labour prices alongside
stiff competition from more innovative and cost-efficient companies in
Europe, Japan, and eventually China.

In 2020, Statistics Canada released a study on the effect of Ontario's
manufacturing sector decline on employment and wages. Studying a period
of accelerated decline from 2000 to 2015, StatsCan found that Ontario
manufacturing communities were hit hard, with the most severe reductions
in employment and wages experienced by less educated men. This
conclusion is supported by a new working paper with the National Bureau
of Economic Research which finds that deindustrialization causes more
severe and longer-term impacts on employment in cities with low rates of
university education.

Alberta's oil and gas employment is vulnerable to a similar shock. As of
the 2021 census, the rate of university education (bachelor's degree and
higher) for working age men in Alberta was 27.6 per cent, roughly
equivalent to the 26.0 per cent rate of university education of men in
Ontario in 2006. In the Wood Buffalo Census Area encompassing Fort
McMurray and the oil sands mines, the rate of university education among
men is just 17.3 per cent, well below Windsor-based men in 2006. [[If
oil prices **settle below**]{.mark} [what is required for Canadian
oil]{.mark} production [to be **competitive**]{.mark} on the world
market, these]{.underline} \[[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}\] men [[could
face **prolonged unemployment**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Direct [unemployment caused by]{.underline} oil and gas
[deindustrialization would be as socially and economically damaging as
manufacturing deindustrialization was for]{.underline} parts of
[Ontario]{.underline}. Between 2001 and 2010, employment in durable
goods manufacturing in Ontario dropped by nearly two hundred thousand.
For comparison, around 95 thousand people in Alberta are employed in the
oil and gas industry (combining oil and gas extraction and support
activities for mining and oil and gas extraction). While the oil and gas
industry make up a smaller amount of overall employment, it makes up a
larger proportion of the labour force in Alberta compared with
manufacturing in Ontario. [Alberta's broader economy is also deeply
interlinked with oil and gas, like Ontario's economy was with durable
goods manufacturing]{.underline} prior to the decline.

[The **larger threat** may not be from unemployment, but rather the
**loss** of an **incredibly productive asset** which will be difficult
to replace in Canada's econ]{.underline}omy. [While the effect of this
will be most deeply felt in Alberta, its **ultimate impact** will be
**spread across Canada**.]{.underline}

A [[**rapid collapse** of **Canada's oil**]{.mark} industry [would have
**immediate impacts on**]{.mark} **government
[revenues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2022, [[oil]{.mark} and gas
producers [paid]{.mark} a total of \$[46 billion in]{.mark}
[royalties]{.mark} and income taxes to Canadian federal and provincial
governments]{.underline} -- around \$1,182 per Canadian. [[Adding
income]{.mark} taxes]{.underline} for employees, [taxes on
[dividends]{.mark}]{.underline} from investors, fees on [land sales,
[and property]{.mark}]{.underline} taxes [[equates to **billions
more**]{.mark} revenue]{.underline} attributable directly to oil and gas
production. Both [royalties and income taxes are expected to remain
elevated as the major oil sands projects enter the "post-payout" royalty
status and the industry shifts cash flow away from major new capital
expenditure and toward income.]{.underline}

[**Government [revenues]{.mark}** from Canada's oil and gas industry may
[become]{.mark} more [important as Canada faces]{.mark} a crisis of
**[declining productivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This past March, Bank
of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers delivered a speech to
the Halifax Partnership, where she called attention to this crisis.
Productivity measures how efficiently the Canadian economy produces
goods and services. In a period of declining efficiency, Canadians will
face a declining standard of living, meaning reduced ability to afford
adequate housing, food, and healthcare.

[The healthcare issue is of note since [Canada's aging population will
require]{.mark} a steadily [increasing]{.mark} share of
[employment]{.mark} to be [directed to health]{.mark}
services]{.underline}. Healthcare productivity is atrocious. Government
health services labour productivity is just \$41/hour, measured in 2017
CAD. For reference, transportation equipment manufacturing has a
productivity of \$66.9/hour, and finance and insurance \$93/hour. Oil
and gas extraction, meanwhile, has a spectacular labour productivity of
\$387/hour.

[Even though not all Albertans are directly employed in oil and gas
extraction, a rapid drop in oil and gas employment is likely to have an
outsized impact on Canada's economic sustainability]{.underline}.
[**Albertan** labour force **productivity** has exceeded the rest of
Canada for decades because of the extraordinary productivity of the
industry]{.underline}. [Alberta's exceptional productivity is the
driving force behind higher household incomes, and therefore higher
levels of **[tax revenues]{.mark}**]{.underline} collected by the
Government of Canada in Alberta than elsewhere. [These taxes have
[allow]{.mark}ed [governments]{.mark} outside of Alberta [to offer more
extensive services]{.mark} than would otherwise be
possible]{.underline}, for example through equalization payments.

[[If Alberta's oil]{.mark} industry [suffers]{.mark} a **[rapid
collapse]{.mark}** similar to]{.underline} or worse than the collapse of
[manufacturing in the Rust Belt, [it will have]{.mark}
**[significant]{.mark}** and far-reaching **[negative
impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} across Canada. Canadian policymakers must
therefore consider the international competitiveness of the industry
when designing energy and environmental policy.

#### Oil is Canada's [golden goose]{.underline}. It's on track to secure [decades of prosperity]{.underline}.

Sometime this financial quarter, the [Canadian oilsands will hit a major
milestone: **one trillion dollars** in cumulative spending.]{.underline}

This number does not represent profits or dividends. [It is the amount
of **direct spending**]{.underline} -- the capital, the operating
expenses, the taxes and the royalties -- that [Canada's **most
important** industrial activity has **injected into the
econ**]{.underline}omy over a period of about 25 years. The
[[**oilsands** are Canada's **winning lottery
ticket**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Economists are well aware of the huge outlay of capital that the
oilsands attracted in the early 2010s. [Many macroeconomic datasets are
distorted by them: **[investment]{.mark}**]{.underline} attraction,
[**[productivity]{.mark}**, **[GDP]{.mark}** per capita: **[all enjoyed
a bump]{.mark}** during the oilsands' most capital-intensive
years]{.underline}. What's less discussed is how those early outlays of
capital committed producers to operational and de-bottleneck spending
for years to come: the drilling, well pads, gathering pipelines and
equipment needed to sustain and optimize operations.

As a result of higher royalties and taxes, oilsands spending actually
peaked in 2022, not 2014, the latter of which was the high point for the
construction phase of the oilsands' life cycle. The 2022 oilsands
expenditures were equivalent to the GDP of Saskatchewan that same year.

[The **[trillion dollars in spending]{.mark}** has **[bolstered the
Canadian econ]{.mark}**]{.underline}omy [in **hundreds** of ways, but a
few are worth highlighting]{.underline}. [Over \$[107 billion in
royalties]{.mark} and \$79 billion in taxes [have been paid]{.mark} to
Canadian governments, representing more than the **last five years** of
Canadian **defense spending**.]{.underline}

**[Billions]{.underline}** in goods and services [have been procured
from Indigenous **businesses**, and tens of billions from]{.underline}
the [manufacturing]{.underline} sector in central Canada. [Far from just
an Alberta success story, the oilsands are a **quintessentially Canadian
sector**]{.underline}. More than 2,300 companies outside of Alberta have
had direct business with the oilsands, including over 1,300 in Ontario
and almost 600 in Quebec.

If anything, [the trillion-dollar figure is
**conservative**]{.underline}. [It does not include third-party
handling, tankage or pipeline spend]{.underline} (the cost of TMX, for
example). [And it does not include IT, corporate]{.underline},
**[r]{.underline}**esearch a**[n]{.underline}**d
**[d]{.underline}**evelopment, diluent costs [or]{.underline} the
[indirect spend that]{.underline} impacts countless firms across the
country. [These add tens of billions more to]{.underline} worker
[paycheques, small business profits, and taxes.]{.underline}

Such a golden goose should surely be cossetted by our political class?
Of course not. The oilsands have been consistently undermined by Ottawa.
The announcement of an emissions cap is the latest example.

Analysis by S&P Global and the Conference Board of Canada show that,
depending on the implementation, the cap could force a reduction in
output of well over one million barrels of oil equivalent/day, almost of
all of which would have to come out of our exports to the United States.
This would lead to a significantly lower balance of trade and an even
weaker dollar, affecting all Canadians' buying power.

[Canada has [the]{.mark} world's **[fourth-largest]{.mark}** oil
**[reserves]{.mark}**]{.underline}; a democracy alone on a list with
authoritarian regimes Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Iran. **[Ninety-seven
per cent]{.underline}** of those reserves [are in]{.underline} the
[Alberta oilsands. That juggernaut [could **keep Canada**]{.mark}**'s
econ**]{.underline}omy [[**prosperous** for]{.mark} many more
**[decades]{.mark}**]{.underline}, providing the feedstock for chemicals
and carbon-based materials whenever global fuel consumption starts to
decline.

In fact, [based on the last three years of current expenditures, the
[oilsands would hit their next **trillion-dollar**]{.mark} spending
[**milestone** in **half the time** it took to **hit the
first**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[With good **planning** and collaboration]{.underline}, some of its
[[**future expenditures** will go toward emissions-reductions]{.mark}
activities [such as **carbon capture**]{.mark}]{.underline} and storage,
[[and new tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [investment such as carbon
fibre production]{.underline}.

[[**But** if companies are **forced** to cut]{.mark} their production,
[they **won't be able to afford** to]{.mark} **aggressively [cut
emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Nor]{.mark}** will they be able to
**[make]{.mark}** other **[investments]{.mark}** to maximize and sustain
the value of this resource. Shareholders will put their money elsewhere,
and spending will decline.]{.underline}

A trillion-dollar milestone is something to celebrate. Governments and
industry need to collaborate so we can reach it again.

#### Sustained oil exports [buoy Canadian growth]{.underline} and [fund diversification]{.underline}.

of Business,

The transition to a low-carbon energy future is well underway. But it
will still take years to come to fruition. Meanwhile, [[an **oil
boom**]{.mark} **seems likely**.]{.underline} [[For **Canada**]{.mark},
this [is a **golden opportunity** to]{.mark} transform our energy
sector, become a leader in clean energy and **[strengthen our
econ]{.mark}**]{.underline}omy. It won't be easy. But the time to get
started is now.

The past few years have not been good for the oil and gas sector in
Canada. Prices fell and stayed low. Investment capital dried up,
regulatory burdens increased, environmental criticism of oil and gas
grew more powerful, pipelines proved difficult to construct and the
global COVID-19 pandemic deflated demand. That is a lot to deal with in
a short period.

But [things are changing]{.underline}. [Developed economies are coming
back]{.underline} to life. Projected annualized growth in the United
States has reached an unheard of seven per cent. [**Oil prices** have
rebounded]{.underline}---they are now more than US\$70 a barrel, driving
up the Canadian dollar. [Financial traders are excited about a potential
prolonged boom in oil prices. **Stock**]{.underline}
price**[s]{.underline}** of [oil and gas]{.underline} companies [are
rising]{.underline}. The oil cycle is starting to climb up.

It will take time for any boom to materialize, of course. There's still
production slack in the system. Oil output in Canada hovers steadily
around four million barrels per day. But U.S. production is down two
million barrels a day from 2019 levels, and Saudi Arabia has taken
several million off the market to try to bolster prices. Other countries
have also cut production.

Yet analysts argue that **[rebounding]{.underline}** global
**[growth]{.underline}** [will soon push demand back to---and even
beyond---pre-pandemic levels]{.underline}. [That surge]{.underline},
compounded with a recent lack of investment in the oil sector, [might
set the stage for a demand crunch and a significant price
rise.]{.underline}

What should Canada do?

[Elevated demand might **last a while**]{.underline}. The International
Energy Agency recently issued a pathway for the world to follow to reach
**[[net-zero]{.underline}]{.mark}** carbon emissions [[by
**2050**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That path [[is
**unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark} to be followed. [What it
demands]{.underline} from governments and consumers [belies all
historical experience about what they can or will do]{.underline}. In
most realistic scenarios, [oil demand will **likely** peak in the next
two decades **before** declining.]{.underline}

[[The world will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely **[[need more
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we emerge out of the pandemic. [[Countries
that **produce**]{.mark} that oil [will **reap**]{.mark} the **[high
economic returns]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This includes Canada, the
fifth-largest producer]{.underline}]{.mark} of oil and gas in the world.
How should Canada respond if the anticipated boom happens?

For starters, oil producers should learn well the lessons taught over
the past decade. They need to continue improving their environmental,
social and governance (ESG) performance. Such efforts differentiate
Canadian producers, enhance their social licence to operate, buy
investor credibility and keep Canadian businesses meeting societal
demands that will not go away.

Capital providers can reinforce this trend in their investment
decisions. Some investors now shun petroleum because of environmental
concerns. Low oil prices and poor investor returns over the past six
years have made that a mostly painless decision. Yet, [as prices and
potential returns go up, foregoing oil investments completely will be
harder.]{.underline}

Discerning investment choice will reward, complement and motivate
enhanced ESG performance that will give the Canadian oil sector an
advantage over those in other producing countries that may care less
about such issues.

Next, we need the federal government and provinces to work
constructively together on energy relations. Ottawa has taken some
initial steps. The recent budget invests in carbon sequestration
technologies, and one of the few pipelines actually being built is owned
by the federal government.

Save for a rainy day

Yet, for Alberta, this seems too little, too late after eight years of
suffering. Canada's equalization payments system needs overhauling, and
more effort could be put into developing energy infrastructure projects
that move Canada's oil to its coasts.

What else? Canada must cultivate a positive but realistic energy
relationship with the United States. [The U.S. still absorbs over **90
per cent** of Canada's oil exports]{.underline}. That is too much
customer concentration.

Moreover, the U.S. is not always friendly to Canadian energy interests.
If proof was needed, the governor of Michigan's attempt to shut down
Enbridge Inc.'s Line 5 (currently working its way through the U.S.
courts) demonstrates how Canadian energy sovereignty can be put at risk
by U.S. political decisions. We need the independence that alternate
export routes provide.

Finally, [if resource revenues grow, it might be wise to save some of
it. The **Alberta** **Heritage Trust Fund**]{.underline}, [the
province's sovereign wealth fund for saved resource
revenues]{.underline}, remains at levels similar to those in the 1970s,
when it was created. This is despite the hundreds of billions of dollars
of resource revenue the province's energy exports have generated.

Preparing now to save more of that money might be easier than trying to
do so when oil prices rise. Moreover, [[if Alberta **wants**]{.mark}
long-term economic **[diversification]{.mark}** and a stronger
bargaining position]{.underline} within the Canadian federation,
[[having]{.mark} **[significant saved energy revenue]{.mark} in the bank
[might help]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Positioning Canada]{.mark} now for the next oil boom [will **reap
dividends**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The opportunity should be seized.
There]{.underline} likely [will not be many more.]{.underline}

#### Energy is key: [imports]{.underline}, [jobs]{.underline}, and [royalties]{.underline}. 

**Finlayson 24**, MBA @ Yale, Post-Graduate Diploma Economics @

Finlayson, 7-12-2024, \"Energy exports continue to fuel the Canadian
economy,\" Fraser Institute,
https://www.fraserinstitute.org/commentary/energy-exports-continue-fuel-canadian-economy)

[[Energy sits at the **heart** of Canada's]{.underline}]{.mark} export
**[[econ]{.underline}]{.mark}**omy, even though some federal
policymakers and provincial governments appear to be discomfited by that
fact.

In recent years, [energy has supplied]{.underline} 20--[**25 percent**
of Canada's total international exports]{.underline} (goods plus
services combined), [with]{.underline} crude **[oil]{.underline}**,
[refined **petroleum**]{.underline} products, [and]{.underline} natural
[gas making up the lion's share]{.underline} of our energy-related
shipments to other countries. Canada's energy export basket also
includes coal, uranium, and electricity.

In the last two decades, [[energy has become Canada's **leading
export**]{.mark} sector, mainly [owing to]{.mark}]{.underline} higher
**[oil]{.underline}** production volumes, rising hydrocarbon exports,
[and **still-[robust]{.mark} global [demand]{.mark}** [for
**fossil**]{.mark} fuel**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which provide 80
percent of the world's primary energy). Measured in millions of barrels
of oil equivalent (BOE), Canadian conventional oil and gas production
rose from 4.5 million BOE per day in 2015 to 5.4 million/day last year,
[[with **most**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the additional [[output]{.mark}
destined [for the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. With the completion of pipeline expansion
projects and the looming start-up of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
production on the West Coast, oil and gas are set to play an even bigger
role in Canada's economy and export portfolio in the coming years.

A May 2024 modelling study by **[S&P]{.underline}** Global Commodity
Insights [predicts a further jump in conventional oil and gas
output]{.underline} of between 0.5 and 1.0 million BOE/day by 2035,
assuming the federal government doesn't impose draconian caps on
production in the sector as part of its shambolic climate policy agenda.
Based on that scenario, S&P estimates that [production, capital and
operating [spending in Canada's]{.mark} conventional [oil]{.mark} and
gas industry [will add]{.mark}]{.underline} up to \$**[[1.3 trillion
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** Canada's **[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**ross
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**omestic **[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roduct
by 2035. [This forecast is premised on a modest (8 percent) increase in
output]{.underline} and further declines in the sector's greenhouse gas
emissions intensity due to efficiency measures, advances in technology,
greater use of carbon capture, and other factors.

To illustrate the contribution that energy makes to Canada's prosperity,
the Coalition for A Better Future recently estimated that without
exports of oil, natural gas and other energy goods, Canada's cumulative
trade deficit with the rest of the world---which stood at \$130 billion
in the decade ending in 2023---would have ballooned to \$1 trillion.

[Thanks to energy]{.underline} production, [Canada garners up to
\$[**200 billion** of]{.mark} additional [export receipts each
year]{.mark}---and the figure is [set to **rise
significantly**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the next decade. [This outsized
**stream of** export **earnings** [furnishes]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the
means to **pay for imports**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[supports **hundreds
of thousands** of]{.mark} **high-paying [jobs]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[and generates **tens of billions**]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars
[[of]{.mark} extra **[revenues]{.mark}** for Canadian
governments]{.underline}.

In Canada's case, it is also worth noting that [energy reliably produces
the largest trade surplus of any sector, by a wide margin]{.underline}.
And, as noted above, that surplus will increase in size over the rest of
this decade and possibly beyond, mainly due to oil and gas output and
exports climbing from current levels.

Averaged over the period 2022-23, Canada's two-way trade in energy goods
yielded a net annual surplus of almost \$150 billion. This dwarfs the
surpluses posted in other natural resource-based sectors such as metal
ores, non-metallic minerals, agri-food, and forest products. [Large
trade [surpluses in energy]{.mark}]{.underline}---and, to a lesser
extent, in other natural resource industries---[[offset
**chronic**]{.mark} Canadian trade [**deficits** in consumer
goods]{.mark}, machinery and equipment, electronic products, and other
high-tech goods]{.underline}. Canada also runs a trade deficit of
\$35-40 billion in motor vehicles and parts.

Trudeau [government ministers are fond of talking up]{.underline} (and
subsidizing) [Canadian non-fossil]{.underline} fuel [energy
industries]{.underline}, [like]{.underline} (carbon-free) electricity,
biofuels, hydrogen (production of which currently is almost non-existent
in Canada) and the "**[[clean tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**" sector.
**[However]{.underline}**, except for electricity, [these segments of
the Canadian energy sector [are **very small**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
size [[and **export little**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And while the "[clean
tech]{.underline}" industry does hold considerable promise over the
medium term, today it [accounts for less than one percent of Canada's
international exports.]{.underline}

When it comes to energy exports, the reality for Canada is that oil,
natural gas, and other fossil fuel products dominate the picture---and
will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

reduce]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline} by a proposed
cap on emissions from oil and gas and additional carbon taxes, **[facts
and figures]{.underline}** of the past decade [show that
**[energy]{.mark} exports** [are now]{.mark} nearly [a **quarter** of
the value of Canada's]{.mark} total [exports]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[This will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [**[continue]{.mark} to be the
case** in the foreseeable **future**, [considering]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [still **[robust global oil demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the
expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, and expected start-ups of
Canadian **LNG export projects**]{.underline}, according to Jock
Finlayson, a senior fellow of the Fraser Institute.

Alongside surging production, Canada's oil and gas exports jumped in the
period 2002 to 2022, with export value soaring from US\$26.7 billion
(C\$36.5 billion) in 2002 to US\$133 billion (C\$182 billion) in 2022
and most of it going to the United States, the Canadian Energy Centre
said earlier this year.

In 2002, [oil and gas accounted for 9% of Canada's most exported
products. That share jumped to 23% in 2022, making oil and gas the
**single largest export**]{.underline} category.

[[Canada saw]{.mark} a **[record-high]{.mark} oil [production]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} 20**[23]{.mark}** amid expanding oil sands
output]{.underline}, data from Statistics Canada showed.
**[[Exports]{.underline}]{.mark}** in terms of volumes [[also hit
a]{.mark}n all-time [high]{.mark} last year]{.underline}, rising by
3.2%, although the value has declined somewhat due to lower crude oil
and natural gas prices compared to the 2022 highs.

This year, Canadian output of crude and natural gas continues to rise as
producers ramp up activity now that they have 600,000 barrels per day
(bpd) of additional egress for their crude with the expanded Trans
Mountain pipeline. [[More oil]{.mark} and gas [exports are]{.mark} also
**[in the cards]{.mark}** in the coming years [as TMX is now delivering
more crude]{.mark} to Canada's Pacific coast for]{.underline} export
[[via tankers to the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
Asia]{.underline}---the most prized export market for any producer.

"[With improved access to global markets, [Canadians can look forward
to]{.mark} receiving higher value for our energy resources, meaning
**[more]{.mark} [money coming]{.mark} back [into the
econ]{.mark}**]{.underline}omy," Lisa Baiton, President and CEO of the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said.

"The completion of [the Trans Mountain Expansion will help Canada play
an enduring strategic role in ensuring our allies and trading partners
have access to a reliable and trusted source of critical
energy]{.underline}," Baiton added.

[Combined, crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas exports accounted for
roughly 20% of total Canadian exports]{.underline} last year, CAPP said
in a presentation earlier this year.

In tandem with the development of Alberta's oil sands, Canada has
steadily grown its crude oil exports, which averaged about 4.2 million
bpd in 2023, more than double the 2008 levels of about 2 million bpd.

[[In its **key export market**, the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [[Canadian crude has **taken market
share** from **Venezuela** and **OPEC**]{.mark}'s Middle Eastern
producers in recent years, while Canada is expected to have its first
LNG exports in 2025 from the West Coast]{.underline}, with the start-up
of LNG Canada Phase 1, CAPP says.

Other LNG projects could also boost Canadian natural gas exports and
diversify Canada's gas customers to the Asian market, compared to the
sole market in the U.S. at present.

Last month, the Haisla Nation and Pembina Pipeline Corporation decided
to move ahead with the Cedar LNG project, a floating LNG export facility
on Canada's West Coast, and the world's first indigenous majority-owned
LNG project.

Together with another project on the Pacific Coast, Shell-led LNG
Canada, Cedar LNG in Kitimat, British Columbia, would be one of the
first Canadian export projects and would take advantage of the proximity
of the Pacific Coast to the key importing markets in Asia.

[These projects are set to boost Canadian oil and gas exports in terms
of volumes]{.underline}, while the TMX start-up is expected to boost the
price of Canada's heavy crude oil for years to come.

What else? Canada must cultivate a positive but realistic energy

[Canada's export dependency with the US isn't just mathematically high,

### IL\-\--Low Oil Prices\-\--2NC

#### Low oil prices are the [largest threat]{.underline} to Canadian growth

**Millington 16**, MA Economics, VP Research @ the Canadian Energy
Research Institute (Dinara, February 2016, "LOW CRUDE OIL PRICES AND
THEIR IMPACT ON THE CANADIAN ECONOMY," Canadian Energy Research
Institute, Study No. 156, p. 37,
https://natural-resources.canada.ca/sites/nrcan/files/energy/energy-resources/CERI_Study_156_Full_Report.pdf)

Chapter 4: Conclusion

One of [[the **biggest risk**]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[to Canada's
economic outlook stems from]{.underline}]{.mark} the recent **[[decline
in the price of oil]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other commodities. [[As a
**net**]{.mark} oil [**exporter**, Canada is]{.mark} and will be
[affected by]{.mark} the **[lower prices]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[operating through **several channels**]{.underline}]{.mark} as
described in the report. These include changing consumer spending in
response to lower energy prices and, consequently, the falling Canadian
dollar, falling investment and employment in the economy's resource
sector, and rising investment and employment in the non-resource
sectors.

Signs of a broadening recovery have been emerging during the past year.
Stronger US growth and a weaker Canadian dollar have boosted non-energy
exports. Investment spending and job creation have also begun to pick up
in non-energy sectors, although significant slack remains in the labour
market. But [overall, Canadian economic growth could be on average **23
percent lower** if **low oil prices persist**]{.underline} over the next
seven years. The regional differences suggest that some provinces will
hurt and some will benefit from lower crude prices, but on the national
level, Canadian economic growth will suffer as a result of low crude
prices.

On a cumulative basis:

- [**[GDP]{.mark}** growth [will be **24**]{.mark}]{.underline}.5
  **[[percent lower]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Low Case versus the
  Reference Case. The annual average impact under the Reference Case is
  \$118.6 billion in comparison to an annual average of \$89.6 billion
  in the Low Case.

- [[Employment]{.mark} will be **[19]{.mark}**]{.underline}.7
  **[[percent lower]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Low Case than that
  under the Reference Case. Over the forecast period, it is estimated
  that, on average, there will be almost 116,000 fewer jobs (direct,
  indirect and induced) in Canada if crude oil prices remain low.

- Overall [compensation]{.underline} in the Canadian economy [is
  estimated to]{.underline} be about \$54.9 billion on an annual average
  basis in the Reference Case compared to \$42.5 billion in the lower
  oil price scenario, for a **[decline]{.underline}** of over \$**[12
  billion]{.underline}** [on an annual average basis.]{.underline}

- [Federal [tax revenues amount to]{.mark}]{.underline} \$13.6 billion
  in the Reference Case and \$10.2 billion in the Low Case, [[a **25
  percent decrease**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

- Under the Low Case, provincial taxes have a cumulative impact of 22
  percent lower than under the Reference Case. The annual average is
  \$8.4 billion under the Reference Case and \$6.5 billion under the Low
  Case.

It is not a surprise that Western Canadian provinces will be negatively
impacted by low oil prices, [[the **low exchange rate** will **not
offset** the decline]{.mark} of the energy sector]{.underline}.
Provinces in eastern Canada will fare much better from the price decline
and actually see higher economic growth.

### IL\-\--Stranded Liabilities\-\--2NC

#### Collapse of oil demand creates [stranded liabilities]{.underline} that [sink government finances]{.underline}

**Leach 22**, PhD Economics, Professor in the Economics Department,
Professor in the Faculty of Law, and Co-Director of the Institute of
Public Economics @ the University of Alberta (Andrew, 11-9-2022,
\"Canada's oil sands in a carbon-constrained world,\" Canadian Foreign
Policy Journal Volume 28, Issue 3, Taylor & Francis,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/11926422.2022.2120508)

With [that said, it is still certainly the case that]{.underline}, all
else equal, [[**less demand for oil** implies]{.mark} lower prices and
**[higher risks of stranded liabilities]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [And the
[oil sands have a **lot of liabilities**]{.mark} at risk of stranding,
with tailings ponds and site reclamation responsibilities at the top of
the list]{.underline}. [Fluid fine tailings are the [residuals from
oil]{.mark} sands mining [operations]{.mark}]{.underline}, comprised of
water, sand, clay, bitumen, and heavy metals. [They [are stored
in]{.mark} tailings [ponds]{.mark}, [and the current volume]{.mark} of
these ponds [is **staggering**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As of the end of
2020, 1360 million cubic meters of fluid fine tailings and 479 million
cubic meters of process-affected water were stored in ponds on Northern
Alberta. To put this figure into perspective, Toronto's domed baseball
stadium, Rogers Centre, has an interior volume of 1.6 million cubic
meters and so the volume of fluid tailings and process-affected water in
the oil sands could fill the home of the Blue Jays 1150 times over.
(This, and tailings statistics to follow taken from Alberta Energy
Regulator, Citation2021b; Rogers Centre volume from Major League
Baseball, Citation2022.) [The situation is also getting
**worse**]{.underline} -- between 2014 and 2020, [non-remediated fluid
fine tailings volume increased by 27%, while stored water volume
increased by 17%. And, the timelines to reclamation are
long]{.underline}: for example, the CNRL Horizon mine has an approved
tailings management plan that sees stored tailings volumes doubling from
current levels by 2030, and has most tailings remediation planned for
the early 2060s (Alberta Energy Regulator, Citation2021b). [The
[potential for stranded liabilities is **substantial** if oil]{.mark}
sands mining [projects become insolvent. Estimates]{.mark} of the total
oil sands reclamation liability lie [in the]{.mark} tens to **[hundreds
of billions of dollars]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pembina Institute,
Citation2018; Yewchuk, Citation2021). The Government of [[Alberta holds
**minimal surety** against these liabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}: less
than \$1 billion today (AER, Citation2021a), held in the form of cash,
letters of credit, or approved demand forfeiture bonds (AER,
Citation2022b). The surety regime effectively allows companies to use
the forward-looking value of their mining assets as collateral against
their reclamation liabilities, and global energy transitions and
international and domestic actions on climate change will likely erode
the value of that collateral.

[Another significant potential for stranded liabilities lies in the
infrastructure serving the oil sands. The major **[pipelines]{.mark}**
which allow the export of oil sands products rely either on common
carrier pipeline regulations or on long-term contracted shipping with
the oil sands producers. Both [are **subject to significant risk** due
to]{.mark} global [action on climate]{.mark} change. The contracts held
by pipeline companies are subject to counter-party risk, and that risk
is highly correlated since global events that affect any one oil sands
producer are likely to affect all producers]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[[as volumes are]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually
[[reduced]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [[pipeline]{.mark} financial
structure[s]{.mark} [are subject to]{.mark} regulatory **[downward
spirals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Canada has already seen a similar
evolution of the financial viability of the natural gas mainline
[[where]{.mark}by]{.underline} a vicious cycle of [[reduced volumes
lead]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to increased tolls]{.underline}]{.mark}
led to the regulator restricting the capacity for the owner to recover
all costs from shippers (Reuters, Citation2013). Regardless of the
specific regulatory environment for each pipeline, [a reduction in
shipping volumes risks creating **insolvencies** in the pipeline
sector]{.underline} over time, [and thus the stranding of]{.underline}
environmental and other [liabilities]{.underline}. In the context of
cross-border pipelines, this risk is exacerbated by the interaction of
regulatory regimes in Canada and the United States.

### IL\-\--Banking\-\--2NC

#### Oil decline causes [financial insolvency]{.underline}\-\--Canadian banks are [uniquely exposed]{.underline}

**Leach 22**, PhD Economics, Professor in the Economics Department,
Professor in the Faculty of Law, and Co-Director of the Institute of
Public Economics @ the University of Alberta (Andrew, 11-9-2022,
\"Canada's oil sands in a carbon-constrained world,\" Canadian Foreign
Policy Journal Volume 28, Issue 3, Taylor & Francis,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/11926422.2022.2120508)

Finally, there are domestic consequences, both in the labor force and in
the financial sector, to be considered. While oil sands production is a
capital-intensive industry, the oil sands boom in the early 2000s led to
dramatic increases in employment and earnings Marchand, Citation2012,
with employment and investment impacts spilling over into related
industries. Currently, direct employment in the oil sands industry is
over 30,000 workers (PetroLMI, Citation2020), to which indirect jobs in
construction, retail, services, and manufacturing should be added (see
Marchand, Citation2012), although note that Marchand studies times of
construction booms versus the environment of sustained operations that
we see today). Previous rapid industrial collapses, whether in the
forestry, fisheries, or manufacturing areas have led to decades-long
hollowing out of affected regions, and the same is likely to be true of
the oil sands region and much of northeastern Alberta over time. [[The
**financial industry** in Canada]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[faces
risks]{.mark}** that could have global implications]{.underline}. [[The
**size of the oil**]{.mark} sands **[industry]{.mark}** in Canada
[implies substantial exposure of the]{.mark} country's [financial sector
to]{.mark} any **major [insolvencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark}, as with the discussion of pipelines, [the **risks of
insolvency**]{.mark} resulting [from a]{.mark} global [energy transition
is **highly correlated**]{.mark}]{.underline} among what is now a mostly
pure-play oil sands industry. With the exception of Exxon-Mobil, which
is the parent of major oil sands player Imperial Oil, the remaining
major entities of [[Suncor, Cenovus, and Canadian Natural Resources are
all heavily exposed to global oil trends]{.mark}, but also to
oil-sands-specific trends. Each has substantially expanded their oil
sands holdings in recent years]{.underline} through mergers and
acquisitions (Fawcett, Citation2020), [increasing]{.underline} the
**[concentration]{.underline}** and decreasing the diversification in
their asset holdings.

### IL\-\--AT: Clean Energy Solves

#### Clean energy can't fill in: [exports]{.underline} and [royalties]{.underline}. 

**Finlayson 24**, MBA @ Yale, Post-Graduate Diploma Economics @
University of London, senior fellow of the Fraser Institute (Jock
Finlayson, 7-12-2024, \"Energy exports continue to fuel the Canadian
economy,\" Fraser Institute,
https://www.fraserinstitute.org/commentary/energy-exports-continue-fuel-canadian-economy)

[[Energy sits at the **heart** of Canada's]{.underline}]{.mark} export
**[[econ]{.underline}]{.mark}**omy, even though some federal
policymakers and provincial governments appear to be discomfited by that
fact.

In recent years, [energy has supplied]{.underline} 20--[**25 percent**
of Canada's total international exports]{.underline} (goods plus
services combined), [with]{.underline} crude **[oil]{.underline}**,
[refined **petroleum**]{.underline} products, [and]{.underline} natural
[gas making up the lion's share]{.underline} of our energy-related
shipments to other countries. Canada's energy export basket also
includes coal, uranium, and electricity.

In the last two decades, [[energy has become Canada's **leading
export**]{.mark} sector, mainly [owing to]{.mark}]{.underline} higher
**[oil]{.underline}** production volumes, rising hydrocarbon exports,
[and **still-[robust]{.mark} global [demand]{.mark}** [for
**fossil**]{.mark} fuel**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which provide 80
percent of the world's primary energy). Measured in millions of barrels
of oil equivalent (BOE), Canadian conventional oil and gas production
rose from 4.5 million BOE per day in 2015 to 5.4 million/day last year,
[[with **most**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the additional [[output]{.mark}
destined [for the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. With the completion of pipeline expansion
projects and the looming start-up of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
production on the West Coast, oil and gas are set to play an even bigger
role in Canada's economy and export portfolio in the coming years.

A May 2024 modelling study by **[S&P]{.underline}** Global Commodity
Insights [predicts a further jump in conventional oil and gas
output]{.underline} of between 0.5 and 1.0 million BOE/day by 2035,
assuming the federal government doesn't impose draconian caps on
production in the sector as part of its shambolic climate policy agenda.
Based on that scenario, S&P estimates that [production, capital and
operating [spending in Canada's]{.mark} conventional [oil]{.mark} and
gas industry [will add]{.mark}]{.underline} up to \$**[[1.3 trillion
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** Canada's **[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**ross
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**omestic **[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roduct
by 2035. [This forecast is premised on a modest (8 percent) increase in
output]{.underline} and further declines in the sector's greenhouse gas
emissions intensity due to efficiency measures, advances in technology,
greater use of carbon capture, and other factors.

To illustrate the contribution that energy makes to Canada's prosperity,
the Coalition for A Better Future recently estimated that without
exports of oil, natural gas and other energy goods, Canada's cumulative
trade deficit with the rest of the world---which stood at \$130 billion
in the decade ending in 2023---would have ballooned to \$1 trillion.

[Thanks to energy]{.underline} production, [Canada garners up to
\$[**200 billion** of]{.mark} additional [export receipts each
year]{.mark}---and the figure is [set to **rise
significantly**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the next decade. [This outsized
**stream of** export **earnings** [furnishes]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the
means to **pay for imports**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[supports **hundreds
of thousands** of]{.mark} **high-paying [jobs]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[and generates **tens of billions**]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars
[[of]{.mark} extra **[revenues]{.mark}** for Canadian
governments]{.underline}.

In Canada's case, it is also worth noting that [energy reliably produces
the largest trade surplus of any sector, by a wide margin]{.underline}.
And, as noted above, that surplus will increase in size over the rest of
this decade and possibly beyond, mainly due to oil and gas output and
exports climbing from current levels.

Averaged over the period 2022-23, Canada's two-way trade in energy goods
yielded a net annual surplus of almost \$150 billion. This dwarfs the
surpluses posted in other natural resource-based sectors such as metal
ores, non-metallic minerals, agri-food, and forest products. [Large
trade [surpluses in energy]{.mark}]{.underline}---and, to a lesser
extent, in other natural resource industries---[[offset
**chronic**]{.mark} Canadian trade [**deficits** in consumer
goods]{.mark}, machinery and equipment, electronic products, and other
high-tech goods]{.underline}. Canada also runs a trade deficit of
\$35-40 billion in motor vehicles and parts.

Trudeau [government ministers are fond of talking up]{.underline} (and
subsidizing) [Canadian non-fossil]{.underline} fuel [energy
industries]{.underline}, [like]{.underline} (carbon-free) electricity,
biofuels, hydrogen (production of which currently is almost non-existent
in Canada) and the "**[[clean tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**" sector.
**[However]{.underline}**, except for electricity, [these segments of
the Canadian energy sector [are **very small**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
size [[and **export little**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And while the "[clean
tech]{.underline}" industry does hold considerable promise over the
medium term, today it [accounts for [**less than one percent** of
Canada's]{.mark} international [exports]{.mark}.]{.underline}

When it comes to energy exports, the reality for Canada is that oil,
natural gas, and other fossil fuel products dominate the picture---and
will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

### IL\-\--AT: Low Prices Good Turn\-\--2NC

#### Models show a [net negative]{.underline} effect on growth.

**Millington 16**, MA Economics, VP Research @ the Canadian Energy
Research Institute (Dinara, February 2016, "LOW CRUDE OIL PRICES AND
THEIR IMPACT ON THE CANADIAN ECONOMY," Canadian Energy Research
Institute, Study No. 156, p. xi-xxiii,
https://natural-resources.canada.ca/sites/nrcan/files/energy/energy-resources/CERI_Study_156_Full_Report.pdf)

[The fall in oil prices will have a mixture of positive and negative
effects]{.underline} on employment. Thousands of jobs have been lost
already as a result of the recent price collapse, and more will be lost
(if prices continue to fall) in the energy sector2 -- especially on new
drilling and construction projects. Meanwhile, new jobs will be created
in sectors which benefit from lower energy costs (such as transportation
and some manufacturing), as well as for those sectors that would benefit
from the low exchange rate.

[[There will be a **net negative impact** on overall employment]{.mark}
levels as a result of low crude oil prices]{.underline}, however, it is
the least impacted variable among other measured variables, such as GDP,
compensation and tax revenues. Over the 7-year period, employment will
be 19.7 percent lower in the Low Case than that under the Reference
Case. The oil industry is very capital-intensive, but one of the least
labour-intensive sectors in Canada\'s whole economy.

Other sectors such as manufacturing create more jobs per unit of
investment than the energy sector. So while petroleum industry revenues
and profits will fall sharply in coming years, the impact on overall
employment will be less severe. [It is important to note that while the
job layoffs are immediate in the energy sector, employment growth in
non-energy related sectors might take]{.underline} a few [years to
materialize]{.underline}, but given the linear and static nature of the
input-output modelling, it is impossible to incorporate the time lag
feature. Figure E.2 illustrates annual changes in employment for both
cases. Over the forecast period, it is estimated that, on average, there
will be almost 116,000 fewer jobs (direct, indirect and induced) in
Canada if crude oil prices remain low.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

[[Even though]{.mark} the [oil]{.mark} industry [is less
labour-intensive]{.mark}]{.underline} than other industries in Canada[,
[it requires]{.underline}]{.mark} [very [skilled workers who are well
compensated]{.mark}]{.underline}. The difference between the two cases
in terms of compensation amounts to almost 23 percent, indicating that
[[losing **highly-skilled and**]{.mark} **higher [paid jobs]{.mark}** in
the oil industry [will have a larger impact than creating]{.mark} more
less-skilled and [lower paid]{.mark} [jobs among other
industries]{.mark} that are more labour-intensive]{.underline}.3 Over
the forecast period, the overall impact on compensation in the Canadian
economy is estimated to be about \$54.9 billion on an annual average
basis in the Reference Case compared to \$42.5 billion in the lower oil
price scenario, for a decline of over \$12 billion on an annual average
basis (Figure E.3).

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

[With decreases in employment, employee compensation and
profitability]{.underline} of the oil sector, [government **tax
revenues** will also be lower]{.underline} in the Low Case scenario. In
fact, [federally-collected tax revenues are the most impacted
variable]{.underline}, with 25 percent difference between the Reference
and Low cases. [The federal government's [**tax revenues** depend on
corporate oil revenues as well as]{.mark} personal [taxes paid by
employees, hence with lower prices, production and labour,]{.mark} it is
not surprising]{.underline} that [federal [tax revenues are **highly
impacted**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On an annual average basis, the impact
on federal tax revenues amounts to \$13.6 billion in the Reference Case
and \$10.2 billion in the Low Case. As for provincial taxes, under the
Low Case, the cumulative impact will be 22.4 percent lower than under
the Reference Case. An annual average adds up to \$8.4 billion under the
Reference Case and \$6.5 billion under the Low Case (Figure E.4).

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

In conclusion, [Canadian economic [growth could be]{.mark} on average
[23 percent lower]{.mark} if low oil prices persist over the next seven
years]{.underline}. The regional differences suggest that some provinces
will hurt and some will benefit from lower crude prices, but on [the
national level, Canadian economic growth will suffer]{.underline} as a
result of low crude prices.

**[[Despite some mitigating factors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[lower
oil prices are, on the whole, not favourable]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
Canada. For this report, there are two main takeaways from the drop in
oil prices. First, the drop in price has an immediate and temporary
negative effect on the oil industry and other service-oriented sectors
that aid the upstream oil industry in Canada. Second, the broader impact
of low oil prices on Canadian economic growth is on a net basis
negative.

Implications for Canada

Canada, like other countries, has been trying to regain its economic
footing since the global financial crisis. From the outset of the Great
Recession, the Bank of Canada has been providing significant monetary
stimulus. But we have yet to reach the point where growth is
self-sustaining. For that to happen, the sources of growth will have to
rotate away from consumption and toward increased exports, which are our
traditional economic engine.

Signs of a broadening recovery have been emerging during the past year.
Stronger U.S. growth and a weaker Canadian dollar have boosted
non-energy exports. Investment spending and job creation have also begun
to pick up, although significant slack remains in the labour market.

In that context, [[we see]{.mark} important [**risks** to
Canada's]{.mark} economic [outlook stemming]{.mark} from]{.underline}
the recent [[decline in the price of oil]{.underline}]{.mark} and other
commodities[. As a net oil exporter, Canada will be affected by the
lower prices, operating through several channels]{.underline}.

The most immediate impact will be positive: a boost to consumers'
disposable incomes and spending. Lower oil prices will also benefit many
sectors, such as manufacturing, by reducing production costs. Our latest
Business Outlook Survey, which was published yesterday, showed that more
firms than in previous surveys are anticipating declines in their input
costs, thanks in good part to cheaper oil and cheaper commodities in
general.

[[The positive effect]{.underline}]{.mark} on the world economy and the
resulting stronger growth would also be positive for Canada. A buoyant
global economy would increase Canada's non-energy exports, boost
confidence and lead to improved business investment.

However, these gains [[will be **more than
reversed**]{.underline}]{.mark} over time [[as lower **incomes**]{.mark}
in the oil patch and along the supply chain **[spill over]{.mark}** to
the rest of the econ]{.underline}omy. The [[decline in]{.mark} Canada's
terms of [**trade** will]{.mark} also [reduce]{.mark} the country's
[wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [**[low]{.mark}**er **[prices]{.mark}**]{.underline}, if they are
expected to persist, will significantly [[discourage investment and
exploration in]{.mark} the [oil]{.mark} sector]{.underline}. As I
mentioned earlier, we are already seeing signs of this.

Lower oil prices are also typically accompanied by a weaker Canadian
dollar, and this time is no exception. The dollar's depreciation by over
10 per cent against the U.S. dollar in the past six months will help
cushion the economy from the impact of lower oil prices.

**[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[mitigating
factors]{.underline}]{.mark}** I enumerated, **[[low]{.mark}er [oil
prices are]{.mark}]{.underline}** likely, **[[on the
whole]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to be **[[bad for
Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Estimating the magnitude of that overall
impact requires carefully analyzing the interplay between the various
effects as they work through the economy. That is what we are doing as
we prepare next week's forecast.

For the Bank of Canada, there are two main takeaways from the drop in
oil prices. First, we will look through its immediate and temporary
negative effect on total consumer price inflation. Second, we will
closely monitor its broader impacts on growth and the delay it may cause
to the economy's return to its production potential. We will also watch
for any impacts on the rotation of demand that we have begun to witness.

There is a similar effect when it comes to natural resource extraction
in Canada. Yes, it may be true that high worldwide commodity prices
cause foreigners to concentrate more of their purchases on Canadian
petroleum exports, rather than Canadian manufactured goods. But at the
same time, these [[**increased earnings** in]{.mark} the Canadian
[petroleum]{.mark} sector [allow]{.mark} for [**greater purchases** of
manufactured goods]{.mark} **withi[n]{.mark}**
[Canada]{.mark}]{.underline}. In principle [these effects could be
**quite large**, showing]{.underline} that [Canadians in general and
even]{.underline} the [manufacturing]{.underline} sector in particular
[are **enriched** by]{.underline} the presence of bountiful [resource
deposits]{.underline}.

Provincial Distribution of Employment and Output Impacts Generated by
Canadian Resource Development

As explained in the previous section[, a major **weakness** in
[the]{.mark} "**[Dutch Disease]{.mark}**"]{.underline} perspective [is
that it **[overlooks]{.mark}** [the sense in which]{.mark}]{.underline}
western [Canadian resource development provides "export markets" for the
**other provinces**]{.underline}. Thus, even if it is true that other
things equal high worldwide commodity prices lead to large Canadian
resource exports and hence make it harder for Canadian manufacturers to
export their own goods, in practice other things aren't equal, because
[the [profitable]{.mark} Canadian **[resource sectors]{.mark}** are able
to [**demand more goods** from]{.mark} manufacturers in [neighbouring
provinces]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

To get a sense of just how large this effect might be, we will summarize
[**[three]{.mark}** recent **[papers]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [model
the economic impact of]{.underline} (segments of) [the energy
sector]{.underline} on the various provinces. [The studies]{.underline}
focus on different activities, and involve two independent
methodologies, yet [all [reach the **same
conclusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}: Western [resource [extraction
**showers**]{.mark} **large economic [benefits]{.mark}** [on **all
provinces**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Study #1: Alberta Oil Sands (CERI 2011)

The first model we will review comes from the Canadian Energy Research
Institute (CERI).3 The purpose of the CERI study was to model the
economic impacts (including Canadian and US GDP growth, job creation,
etc.) stemming from oil sands projects in Alberta over a 25-year
horizon, under four scenarios ("cases") making different assumptions
about the development of pipeline capacity, including the Keystone XL,
Enbridge Northern Gateway, and other pipeline projects that may or may
not come to fruition.

The CERI study finds that the **[oil]{.underline}** sands development
impacts other provinces, because the [**projects** in Alberta **require
materials** from other provinces]{.underline}. (The study also takes
into account the further spending that this initial burst sets in
motion.) Even in the most conservative of scenarios, Case 1 (where only
existing pipeline capacity is considered), the CERI study estimates the
following provincial distribution of economic benefits attributable to
the development of Alberta oil sands (see table 1).

\[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\]

As table 1 indicates, the CERI model finds -- unsurprisingly -- that the
lion's share of both GDP and employment impacts due to Albertan oil
sands projects, accrue to Alberta itself. Even so, [these projects
shower a substantial benefit]{.underline} (in absolute terms) [on other
provinces]{.underline}. For example, [**Ontario alone** is projected to
enjoy \$**64**.9 **billion** in higher economic output]{.underline}, and
882,000 person-years of additional employment, over the 25-year period.
To repeat, [this incremental economic activity in Ontario is due solely
to sales made to Albertan oil sands projects, under the very
conservative assumption that no additional pipeline capacity is
added.]{.underline}

Although the impacts are not as large, table 1 shows that British
Columbia and Quebec also substantially benefit from Alberta oil sands
projects, experiencing GDP growth of \$28.8 billion and \$14.1 billion,
respectively. British Columbia gains 426,000 person-years of employment,
while Quebec gains 211,000.

Now that we have seen the CERI model's projected regional impacts under
the assumption of no new pipeline capacity, we turn to Case 3, which
assumes that the Keystone XL and Enbridge Northern Gateway pipelines
come on stream (in 2013 and 2016 respectively), and that additional oil
sands projects become operational to take advantage of this new
capacity. Table 2 summarizes the provincial impacts of this more
aggressive Case 3.

\[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\]

The results in table 2 have the same pattern as those in table 1, but
they are much larger. The Case 3 scenario (involving the addition of the
Keystone and Enbridge pipelines) still has the majority of economic
gains accruing to Alberta itself. Yet as with the conservative baseline
case, here too we see that the oil sands projects in Alberta shower a
substantial benefit (in absolute terms) on other provinces. In Case 3,
Ontario experiences \$95.3 billion in higher economic output, and 1.3
million person-years of additional employment, over the 25 year period.
Case 3 projects that British Columbia and Quebec also substantially
benefit, experiencing GDP growth of \$42.4 billion and \$20.7 billion,
respectively. British Columbia gains 628,000 person-years of employment,
while Quebec gains 311,000.

Study #2: Entire Canadian Oil and Gas Sector (CERI 2009)

In the previous subsection we summarized the findings of a July 2011
CERI study, looking at the impacts of the development of the oil sands
in Alberta. In this subsection, we look at an earlier CERI study from
July 2009, which looked more broadly at the entire petroleum industry.4
Specifically, the 2009 CERI report analyzed

economic impacts on the following types of energy, in the following
provinces and territories: Alberta (conventional oil, conventional gas,
CBM, oil sands, major capital projects), British Columbia (conventional
oil, conventional gas, shale/tight gas, major capital projects),
Saskatchewan (conventional oil, conventional gas), Manitoba
(conventional oil), Quebec (major capital projects), Nova Scotia
(conventional gas) and Northwest Territories (major capital projects).
Due to insufficient data analysis was not possible for several sources
of energy, such as the Oil Sands in Saskatchewan or the large potential
of the shale gas plays in Quebec. (CERI 2009, 2)

With this broad focus, the CERI study was able to estimate the total
impacts on economic output and employment among the various provinces
from the petroleum industry. These results are summarized below in
tables 3 and 4:

\[\[TABLES OMITTED\]\]

In tables 3 and 4 above, each column represents the economic impact
generated across all provinces by petroleum industry activities within
that particular column's province. For example, looking at just the
second column "BC" in table 3 and moving down, we see that over the
period specified, [**[petroleum activities]{.mark}** in British Columbia
will [generate]{.mark} an estimated]{.underline} \$13.0 billion in
additional output in Alberta, \$**[[376]{.underline}]{.mark}**.1
**[[billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}**ritish **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**olumbia
itself, \$1.9 billion in Manitoba, and so on. (Note that these figures
are simple summations, not discounted present values.) In the same
column, we see that Alberta petroleum operations also generate \$36.7
billion in additional output in Quebec.

On the other hand, if we want to see the total impact on output that the
petroleum industry has for the province of Ontario, we would look at the
"ON" row (ninth from the top) in table 3. The petroleum sector's
operations in Alberta alone generate \$116.2 billion in output in
Ontario, British Columbia generates \$12.4 billion, and so on, for a
total impact of \$149.1 billion in Ontario.

In similar fashion, the final column in table 4 shows that the
[petroleum]{.underline} sector [generates an estimated 2.2
million]{.underline} person-[years of additional employment in Ontario
alone]{.underline}, during the period 2008-2033, which works out to an
average of 88,000 full-time jobs during the entire period. We also see
that the petroleum sector in all provinces generates 4.2 million
person-years of employment in British Columbia, or the equivalent of
168,000 full-time jobs during the entire period. Finally, Quebec enjoys
812,000 person-years of additional employment, or 32,480 full-time jobs
over the entire 25-year period.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} more
**[[comprehensive]{.underline}]{.mark}** CERI
**[[study]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[shows the **enormous**]{.mark}
**[contribution]{.mark}** that the **petroleum** sector **provides** to
the economies not just of the oil-rich provinces, but **all of
Canada**]{.underline}. The specific mechanism, to repeat, is that [the
high level of construction and extraction activity in Alberta and other
energy-rich areas, ultimately stimulates demand for goods produced in
Quebec and elsewhere]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} important
mechanism [shows the danger in a **naïve application** of the "Dutch
Disease" critique of Canadian commodity exports.]{.underline}

Study #3: Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline (Wright Mansell Research
Ltd.)

In this final subsection, we look at a March 2010 study conducted by a
completely independent group, Wright Mansell Research, which analyzed
the economic impact of the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline.5 The
study explains the background:

Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines (Northern Gateway) is proposing to
construct and operate a pipeline project to provide tidewater access to
new markets for Canadian oil sands production. This consists of a line
from near Edmonton, Alberta to a marine terminal at Kitimat, British
Columbia to transport synthetic crude oil (SCO) and diluted bitumen and
a line to transport condensate from Kitimat to Edmonton. At full
capacity these lines could move an average of 525,000 barrels per day
(bpd) (or 83,400 m3 per day) of oil and 193,000 bpd (or 30,700 m3/d) of
condensate. The anticipated in-service date for the project is 2016.
(Wright Mansell 2010, 4)

Specifically, [the Wright Mansell study looks at the]{.underline}
"direct and indirect effects arising from the construction and operation
of the pipelines, from the increase in prices received by Canadian oil
producers" and "from the reinvestment arising from these increased
revenues."6 Interestingly, the study does not assume that Canadian
petroleum output will be affected by the pipeline. Instead, all of the
[impacts are due to **higher prices** Canadian exporters can obtain for
their petroleum products]{.underline} (by selling to Asia rather than
the United States), in the event that the Northern Gateway is
completed.7 This study is particularly relevant then for evaluating the
"Dutch Disease" claim, since [the Mansell analysis effectively shows the
economic impact on other provinces from Canada's ability to export oil
at higher prices.]{.underline}

Table 5 below summarizes the Wright Mansell study's estimate of the
Northern Gateway pipeline's economic impact on the provinces, through
2046.

\[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\]

Thus we see that in the Wright Mansell study -- which exclusively
considered the effect of higher prices available to Canadian oil
exporters due to the Northern Gateway pipeline -- [other [provinces
enjoy]{.mark} substantial [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ontario, for
example, gains \$3.4 billion in labor income, \$5.1 billion in GDP, and
51,216 person-years of employment. This works out to an average of
almost 1500 full-time jobs in Ontario alone through 2046, and these jobs
are [[due]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely [[to]{.mark} the **[higher
prices]{.mark}** Canadian exporters can obtain [for]{.mark} their
**[crude]{.mark}** exports]{.underline} using the Northern Gateway
pipeline.

Summary of Three Studies

As we have documented, **[[independent studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
[[employing different]{.mark} **[assumptions]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} two
different **[model]{.mark}**ing approache**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
may differ on the exact magnitudes, but they
**[[agree]{.underline}]{.mark}** qualitatively that [the]{.underline}
[[Canadian petroleum]{.mark} industry [contributes to]{.mark} the
economies of [all provinces]{.mark}, even those lacking natural
resource]{.underline} endowment[s]{.underline}. Of particular interest
is the Mansell (2010) study of the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline,
which assumed a constant level of oil production, and merely modeled the
impact of the higher prices achieved by Canadian crude exporters. The
study found that this change by itself would ultimately lead to some
1500 full-time jobs created just in Ontario. Clearly, the relationship
between Canadian commodity exports and manufacturing is more nuanced
than some critics allege.

Provincial and Federal Revenues Generated by Canadian Resource
Development

In the previous section we discussed three separate models of the
petroleum industry's economic impact across the various provinces. [Each
of the studies also used its economic model to estimate the flow of
**government revenues**]{.underline}, at both the provincial and federal
level, [due to]{.underline} the **[petroleum]{.underline}** industry.
[To the extent that [the]{.mark} **[fed]{.mark}**eral government
**[earns tax revenue]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
the natural [resource **[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} based in
oil-rich provinces, [**[other Canadians]{.mark}** indirectly
[**benefit** from]{.mark} enjoying **[lower tax]{.mark}
burden[s]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}/or [a **[higher]{.mark}
level of [federal services]{.mark}** than would otherwise be
possible]{.underline}.

Study #1: Alberta Oil Sands (CERI 2011)

Recall that our first model is the 2011 CERI study, which confined its
attention to the oil sands projects in Alberta over a 25-year horizon.8
Based on the economic impacts discussed in the previous section, the
CERI study projects the following flow of tax and royalty revenues
coming entirely from residents and corporations based in Alberta, as
illustrated in table 6.

\[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\]

As table 6 indicates, although the [[royalties]{.underline}]{.mark} paid
to the Alberta government [from oil sands projects [constitute the
**single largest revenue source**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even so these
activities will generate large streams of revenue in other tax
categories, [at]{.mark} both the **[regional and federal
levels]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (See figure 1 below for a graphical
presentation of the same information.) Over the 2010-2035 period, in
this conservative scenario that (recall) assumes only existing pipeline
capacity, the CERI model projects that individual and corporate
[taxpayers in Alberta will pay some \$328 billion to the federal
government, all because of economic activity attributable to the oil
sands.]{.underline} Even including the large royalty category, [the
federal government still ends up collecting 37 percent of the total
revenues generated by these projects.]{.underline}

FIGURE 1 Provincial-municipal versus federal revenues from Alberta due
to oil sands projects, "Case 1," 2010-2035

height="2.9902034120734906in"}

This result is quite significant in discussions of distributional
impacts from the Canadian petroleum industry. Because of the precision
offered by the CERI 2011 study, we are here focusing on the specific
item of oil sands in Alberta, but the result holds generally: [Strong
**[economic activity]{.mark}** [associated with]{.mark} the development
of natural [energy]{.mark} resources automatically
"**[redistributes]{.mark}**" [wealth]{.mark} from the **resource-rich**
[to]{.mark} the [resource-poor provinces, through **federal fiscal
policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So long as the federal government spends
its funds on activities that generate benefits for all citizens, the
large share of resource development going to federal taxation ensures
that all Canadians indirectly benefit from this activity. [Citizens in
resource-poor provinces benefit from the abundance of their neighbours,
because]{.underline} (other things equal) [higher federal tax payments
stemming from their activities allow for more federal services
and]{.underline}/or [lower]{.underline} federal [tax]{.underline}
rat[es]{.underline}.

Study #2: Entire Canadian Oil and Gas Sector (CERI 2009)

Turning now to the 2009 CERI study, which recall modeled the entire
Canadian oil and gas sector, we find the following distribution of
government revenues, as summarized in tables 7 and 8.9

\[\[TABLES OMITTED\]\]

Recall that in tables 7 and 8 above, each column represents the tax
revenues generated across all provinces by petroleum industry activities
within that particular column's province. For example, looking at just
the second column "BC" in table 7 and moving down, we see that petroleum
activities in British Columbia will generate an estimated \$1.375
billion in federal tax receipts in Alberta, \$52.924 billion in British
Columbia itself, \$290 million in Manitoba, and so on. The total federal
tax receipts in all provinces, attributable to petroleum activities
within British Columbia, amount to an estimated \$57.73 billion over the
25-year period. (Note that these figures are simple summations, not
discounted present values.) On the other hand, if we look at (say) the
fourth row in table 8, we see that of the total \$843 million in New
Brunswick's provincial tax receipts due to the petroleum industry, \$633
million is due to the petroleum industry in Alberta, \$104 million comes
from the petroleum industry's activities in British Columbia, and so on.

Looking just at tax receipts (excluding royalty payments), the CERI 2009
study estimates that over a 25-year period, the Canadian petroleum
industry will generate \$408.6 billion in federal tax revenues, and
\$291.6 in provincial tax revenues, meaning that the federal government
reaps 58 percent of the total tax receipts (modeled in the study).
However, the study also estimates that Alberta, British Columbia,
Saskatchewan, and Manitoba will collectively earn provincial royalties
of \$428.9 billion during the same period from petroleum activities. If
we include these revenues, then the federal government still reaps 36
percent of all tax and royalty payments (modeled in the study), which
the reader may recall is virtually identical to the value (37 percent)
calculated in the previous subsection, which focused just on the oil
sands in Alberta.

Study #3: Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline (Wright Mansell Research
Ltd.)

Finally we report the government revenue estimates provided in the 2010
Wright Mansell Research study, which (recall) focused exclusively on the
higher crude prices made available to Canadian exporters from the
Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline.10 The results are shown in table 9.

Thus we see that in the Wright Mansell study, the federal government
reaps \$36.3 billion (45 percent of the total increase in revenues) from
the construction of the Northern Gateway pipeline and the higher prices
it will bring to Canadian crude exporters.

Conclusion

Despite the claims by certain prominent critics, there is ample evidence
that the petroleum industry showers benefits across the provinces, and
provides outlets for manufactured goods.

In this paper we have discussed three recent studies, which employed
different assumptions and methodologies, which found the petroleum
industry generated large contributions to economic output and employment
even in provinces lacking resource deposits. Furthermore, the studies
estimated large contributions to federal tax receipts from petroleum
operations. While [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called "**[[Dutch
Disease]{.underline}]{.mark}**" mechanism may operate, [in
practice]{.underline} it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} partially (perhaps
**[[more than]{.mark} fully]{.underline}**)
**[[offset]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[gains]{.mark} to the overall Canadian economy [documented by]{.mark}
these [studies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Compounding this negativity is that most natural resource industries are

the reputation of being low-tech and requiring little effort or ambition
beyond luck in the "geographic lottery" that is a resource endowment.
Finally, the country's abundant resources are believed to overtly

The long night

In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Food, researchers led
by Lili Xia and Alan Robock at Rutgers University modeled the climatic
impacts of a nuclear war, and then attempted to quantify the effects on
global food production.

[The results were grim:]{.underline} a full-scale [[nuclear

As a result, the researchers project that [global calorie production
could drop]{.underline} by as much as [90 percent, leaving]{.underline}

now known as [nuclear winter]{.underline}.

["[This]{.mark} would [produce **climate change** that is

[NATO is an **engine of**]{.underline} post-war **[peace]{.underline}**

[[NATO]{.mark} has [helped]{.mark} to **[avert]{.mark}** the **enormous
costs**]{.underline}---both human and economic---[of a
**[large]{.mark}-scale [war]{.mark}** by fostering a **climate of
security** and predictability]{.underline}. Indeed, Europe has enjoyed
an era of peace and stability unprecedented in its history in the
decades following World War II. Much of this success owes to
[NATO's]{.underline} effective [strategy of **[collective
defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which [**[deters]{.mark}** potential
[**aggressors** and **fosters coop**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[among
nations that]{.mark} once [viewed each other with **suspicion**]{.mark}
and **hostility**.]{.underline}

The illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine serves as a stark
reminder that [the threat of large-scale aggression in Europe **still
exists,**]{.underline} and that the principles of collective defense are
as crucial now as they have ever been---a point German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz drove home at the Munich Security Conference last year, where he
asserted with uncharacteristic emphasis that the alliance would defend
all of its territory "without any ifs or buts."

Yet [NATO]{.underline}'s role extends beyond the mere deterrence of
military threats; it [actively promotes **dialogue** and
**collaboration**]{.underline}, [thereby knitting together a community
of nations committed to democratic values. This foundational
commitment]{.underline} to democracy, albeit imperfect,
[will]{.underline} ultimately [pave the way for a more secure and
peaceful future]{.underline}. In the words of Ben Tallis, senior
research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, NATO works
"to make the world safe for democracies."

Scholars have long emphasized the connection between democracy,
international institutions, and a durable peace; NATO brings together
all three. Here, security cooperation acts as a force multiplier. [In a
world]{.underline} increasingly [defined by great power whims, peace
**requires strong** and **resilient alliances**]{.underline}. NATO meets
this moment. Moreover, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[benefits more from participation in international security arrangements
than from isolation]{.underline}. The speculative discussions on a U.S.
withdrawal from the alliance illustrate this point vividly. European
capitals are today crafting contingency plans should the United States
no longer be a reliable partner. This undermines American security
precisely when Washington needs to forge partnerships around the world
for its strategic competition with China.

There are costs to leaving

The potential **[fragmentation]{.underline}** of NATO or an official
U.S. withdrawal [might require significant military deployments
**later** on should Russia expand its war of aggression beyond
Ukraine]{.underline}. Here, the costs associated with reengagement would
likely surpass current investments in the alliance, highlighting NATO's
crucial role in the prosperity and security of its member states. At
\$625.6 million, the U.S. contribution to NATO's common defense fund for
fiscal year 2025 represents just 0.074 percent of the United States'
federal defense budget. Even when accounting for our forward troop
deployments in Europe through the European Deterrence Initiative, which
boosts allies' military readiness, U.S. expenditure amounts to just \$35
billion over the past decade----with an FY 2025 request of \$2.91
billion. These figures, while proportionally modest, are vital to
deterrence. Yet assessing the value of membership should go beyond mere
dollar metrics. [[There are **existential risks** to]{.mark} a U.S.
[withdrawal]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[Consider nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon**[s]{.underline}**: A

[[The **moment the U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[split]{.underline}]{.mark}**
apart, [every world leader knew a single, simple truth]{.underline}:
**[[Pax Americana was over]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The
**[peace]{.mark}**]{.underline} that had been [[maintained]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} the **overwhelming**]{.underline}
**[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** and economic [[**might** of the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[would not hold]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [security guarantees of a
confused]{.underline} and [broken nation meant **nothing**]{.underline}.
[Carrier battle groups that previously had ruled the seas **sat in
port**]{.underline} while the new, opposing nations of the North
American continent negotiated their fate.

American squadrons returned home as their pilots and crews chose sides
in the Great Divorce. The portion of the North American continent that
retained the name "United States of America"---while still economically
powerful---was simply incapable of maintaining the military force or the
security guarantees of a united nation, especially in the year following
the split.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[**tried** to **maintain deterrence** in **hot spots** like]{.underline}
South Korea, [but **rival**]{.underline} great **[powers]{.underline}**
**[knew]{.underline}** that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [was in no condition to project meaningful force
overseas]{.underline}. Even worse, [the entire Western alliance had
grown utterly dependent on U.S.]{.underline} logistical
[assets]{.underline} to move any kind of significant force beyond their
own borders. Britain's two carrier battle groups and France's single
aircraft carrier were insufficient to maintain any deterrent posture in
the Far East, and they were barely adequate to project any real strength
in the Atlantic.

Thus arrived a period that Russian and Chinese military planners quickly
dubbed the "golden years." They knew that the divided American nations
would eventually settle on a security strategy. They knew that allied
powers would ramp up their own military spending and eventually replace
a large portion of the lost American power. But the key word was
"eventually." This would take time.

Modern weapons---including aircraft, main battle tanks, and ships---are
extraordinarily complex. They can't be produced at scale immediately,
even if panicked national governments authorize emergency procurement
programs. The divided American nations arranged hasty sales of
pre-positioned equipment, but it would still take time to recruit and
train men and women to operate new weapons.

Consequently, [[China]{.mark} believed it could **[reclaim
Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline} without triggering a conflict with the
United States. [[Russia]{.mark} knew that it [could **swallow the
Baltic**]{.mark}]{.underline} state**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the
Russian ethnic enclaves in southeastern Ukraine while NATO remained
paralyzed. Russia moved first. Latvia and Lithuania fell to an influx of
"little green men"---Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms and
vehicles---who took key airports and city centers within seventy-two
hours, with hardly a shot fired.

Estonia was different. Estonia resisted fiercely, and so it received the
full weight of the 8th Guards Mechanized Corps. The conflict was intense
but brief. In one week, the Russians secured every major population
center. In three weeks, every element of the Estonian military larger
than a company was destroyed. After a month, only small bands of
partisan fighters remained, and they could mount only sporadic attacks.

**[NATO did nothing]{.underline}**. It could do nothing, aside from
engage in furious denunciations and impose (ultimately short-lived)
economic sanctions. The UN was utterly ineffectual, with China joining
Russia to veto any meaningful Security Council resolutions. American
airpower had largely returned home. American naval assets were in port
in North America. And without American support, neither Britain, France,
nor Germany could project any meaningful force to Estonia or any other
Baltic state. So they stayed put rather than face sure, bloody defeat.

[A Russian-engineered coup **toppled**]{.underline} the Western-allied
government of **[Ukraine]{.underline}**, and just like that, **[[NATO
withered]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The old Eastern Bloc nations realized
their vulnerability and---over time---entered into new security and
trade agreements with their old Russian "allies." Russia regained
control of its near abroad, the [old [great power rivalries
**flared**]{.mark} **again**]{.underline}, and for the first time in
nearly a century, [the world noticed the stirrings of German militarism
as Germany **rearmed** as **fast as possible**]{.underline} to face a
renewed and immediate Russian threat.

Events in Europe were destabilizing, but with the exception of thousands
of dead in Estonia, they were relatively bloodless. The cost was largely
strategic and economic, as the disruptions of the Great Divorce gutted
Western economies even as they faced substantial new defense
obligations.

The Far East wasn't so fortunate. From the moment Chinese planners saw
the United States reneging on its NATO commitments, [they
knew]{.underline} that [Americans would not and could not **aid
Taiwan**]{.underline}. There was not a single American carrier at sea
west of Pearl Harbor. [Not a single American surface ship was in
position even to offer itself up as a "tripwire"]{.underline} to trigger
an American response.

And so China determined to transform its "one China" policy from
political fiction to practical fact. It demanded Taiwan's surrender as
it began an immense, open, and obvious military buildup across the
Taiwan Strait. The intent was clear---to convince Taiwan that resistance
was futile.

But Taiwan had advantages that Estonia did not. First, there was the
significant matter of the roughly hundred-mile-wide strait separating
the island from the mainland. The second was the fact that Japan was
shocked out of its isolation at the prospect of a united, hostile China
with no American ally present to guarantee its security.

**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** mobilized its undersized (though
technologically advanced) military, warned China against aggression, and
then [reached a]{.underline} fateful [decision]{.underline}---[to
**[race to develop a nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear deterrent. In spite
of its unique history as the target of the world's only atomic attacks,
Japan knew that it had to rely on its own power to guarantee its
security, and when facing a nuclear-armed China, Japan needed its own
deterrent, urgently.

China believed that Japan was bluffing. Its planners refused to believe
that the nation would transition from ingrained pacifism to outright
militarism so quickly, and in the absence of any direct threat to
Japanese sovereignty. So China pressed ahead.

Taiwan rejected China's demand for surrender as decisively as possible.
Working with the Japanese military it re-created the surprise attacks of
1941 at scale, with the most modern and sophisticated weapons money
could buy. China's open preparations, designed to cow its rivals into
submission, turned into the nation's military Achilles' heel. Japanese
military doctrine, from Port Arthur to Pearl Harbor, emphasized the
importance of the first strike, and strike first it did.

In part because of Chinese mistakes (after all, it had not fought a
major conflict against a first-rate power since the Sino-Soviet border
clashes in 1969) and in part because of Japanese tactical brilliance,
Japanese and Taiwanese pilots achieved almost complete surprise. Missile
and air strikes arrived virtually simultaneously, sinking Chinese naval
craft and blanketing Chinese air bases with explosions. In a single day,
Japanese and Taiwanese forces rendered an amphibious assault virtually
impossible.

Humiliated and furious, Chinese leaders refused the immediate offer of
peace and launched a massive conventional air and naval counterattack
designed to destroy the Japanese and Taiwanese militaries, crush their
economies, and make them sue for peace. Thus began the most significant
Pacific air and naval conflict since World War II, one that eventually
also drew Australia into the fray---while a wary South Korea mobilized
its reserves and remained neutral as two old foes fought bitter battles
in the seas and skies all around.

For months air raid warnings were routine in many of China's and Japan's
great cities. Commercial shipping ground to a halt. International trade
crashed. Chinese forces fully invaded and occupied Hong Kong. The global
economic disruption that had been called the "American Recession" after
the Great Divorce became the "Pacific Depression" as two of the world's
largest economies ground each other into the dust in the midst of an
all-out air and naval war.

After maintaining a public posture of ambiguity regarding its nuclear
program ---an ambiguity designed to deter Chinese escalation---Japan
dramatically announced its entry into the nuclear club with an
underground test of a substantial 250-kiloton device. South Korea
quickly followed suit. Taiwan indicated that it reserved the right to
build its own bomb. Australia did not test a weapon, but it formally
withdrew from both the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty---two documents that had become
all but meaningless in world affairs. [[The world
began]{.underline}]{.mark} a round of **[[runaway]{.mark} nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}**eration, as advanced nations in multiple
world regions reached for their own arsenal of ultimate weapons.

In the meantime, the conventional war raged on. Slowly but surely, the
Japanese gained superiority in the sky and on the seas. The Taiwanese
air force, lacking either the F-35 or the F-15, struggled to defend its
home island, but the Japanese exacted a fearful toll on Chinese
aircraft, shooting them down far faster than Chinese industry could
replace the losses. One by one, the Japanese sank China's few aircraft
carriers, and after six months of conflict, the Chinese navy was
crippled, with its surface ships rarely venturing out from their heavily
guarded ports.

A land war in China was unthinkable. Neither Taiwan nor Japan wanted to
commit an entire generation of young men to large-scale ground combat,
so the goal was air and naval superiority, followed by economic
strangulation.

The war reached its end stage just as Japanese and Australian forces
launched an ambitious series of amphibious landings designed to seize
each and every disputed island in the Spratly and Senkaku island chains.
With Chinese aircraft chased from the skies and the Chinese navy largely
at the bottom of the sea, a military and economic noose was tightened in
the South China Sea and East China Sea. Large sections of China were
routinely plunged into blackout conditions by relentless attacks on the
nation's power grid, and economic deprivation was creating internal
unrest.

Desperate to stop the fighting, China rattled the nuclear saber. It
declared that the continued invasion of Chinese-claimed territory and
the continued air strikes on the Chinese mainland represented an
existential threat to the nation's existence. Firebrands inside
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} urged leadership to **[[use its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}** [while it still possessed a strategic
edge]{.underline}---claiming that while China could absorb terrible
losses, Japan would be effectively destroyed by a Chinese attack.

Unwilling to repeat the traumas of 1945, Japan stood down. It agreed
first to a cease-fire in place, then to a negotiated withdrawal from
seized Chinese territory---based on a Chinese agreement to completely
demilitarize its disputed island possessions. China refused to enter
into a lasting peace agreement with Taiwan. There was only an armistice.
A humiliated China raced to rebuild its decimated navy and air force. In
response, Japan built up its own air and naval forces to a size and
power not seen since its days of empire.

As for Taiwan, it effectively declared its independence from China by
successfully testing its own hydrogen bomb and building its own nuclear
arsenal. Europe and Asia were not the only flash points. With America in
full retreat, [[Iran attempted to sprint to **its own**]{.mark} nuclear
**[bomb]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a move [blocked]{.underline}---at least
**[temporarily]{.underline}**--- [by]{.underline} a series of
**[Israeli]{.underline}** air **[strikes]{.underline}** that triggered
Hezbollah rocket barrages into northern Israel.

With the eyes of the world focused elsewhere, Israel responded with
overwhelming military force, unleashing its full arsenal on Hezbollah
positions, invading southern Lebanon yet again, crushing Hezbollah, and
driving its remnants out of missile range of Israeli civilians.

For the first time since Israel's war for independence, there was no
international outcry. The great powers were panicked by the reality and
danger of much larger conflicts much closer to home. Saudi Arabia was
quietly pleased at the blow to Iranian power, and after Hezbollah's
initial missile volleys, the militant group proved ineffectual in the
face of a fully mobilized IDF.

By the time the reduced United States and the new nations of North
America reconstituted truly functioning militaries, reached sustainable
security agreements, and began to claw back from economic depression,
the world had changed. [It was as if [the **clock had spun
back**]{.mark} more than a century, [to]{.mark} the multi- power world
that existed before [the First World War]{.mark}]{.underline}---[except
[with]{.mark} **more great powers**, **[more]{.mark}** potential
**[flash points]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} far **more [terrible
weaponry]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In 1914, the great powers had been concentrated in Europe, with Japan
rising in the East. Now India, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan all
possessed formidable economies, growing militaries, and nuclear
weaponry. China still coveted union with Taiwan (and revenge for its
humiliating defeat). South Korea increasingly considered forceful
unification with the unstable North. Japan and China nursed their
ancient grudge, and Chinese and Indian forces clashed along their
disputed boundary

(Eritrea, East Timor, South Sudan and Bangladesh) the world has looked
askance at independence and secession movements in postcolonial
countries.

Western elites have fondly hoped that modernization---understood as
economic development and the spread of democracy---would cause identity
politics and ethno-nationalist grievances to fade. Yet [the history of
Europe from the Napoleonic Wars through the aftermath of World War I is
the story of movements for national liberation that grew more powerful
as economic and social development spread]{.underline}. The [rising
middle classes **powered** nationalist movements across
Europe]{.underline}.

[The multinational and multi-confessional federations and empires of
Europe and the Middle East were pulled apart by the centrifugal forces
of modernization]{.underline}. Genocidal slaughters, ethnic cleansing
and mass floods of refugees became common as these conflicts erupted in
the 19th and early 20th centuries. They flared again late in the 1990s
as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia imploded. Now, [as economic and
social development transform much of the postcolonial world, we are
witnessing new movements of ethnic and religious identity politics as
dangerous as anything Europe saw in the past.]{.underline}

[**Bitter [conflicts of dissolution]{.mark}** [can turn]{.mark}

In Syria, Yemen and Iraq we already see how great-power rivalries can
**inflame** local quarrels]{.underline}, as outside powers aligned with

embrace Marcon's urgent message to defend West, reinvigorate
multilateralism,\" The Hill Times, https://archive.ph/QvKb5)

TORONTO---In an inspired and inspiring speech to the U.S. Congress that
directly challenged the narrow America First foreign policy of U.S.
President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron has set out the
urgent need to **[[defend]{.underline}]{.mark}** the shared values of
the West, to reinvigorate **[[multilat]{.underline}]{.mark}**eralism,
and to strengthen our multilateral institutions.

[It [was a message]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Canada]{.mark} can and
**[should embrace]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The alternative is]{.mark} a
high risk of **global [disorder]{.mark}**, the [**breakdown**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[global [rules]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
conventions that have played such a large role in guiding progress over
the past 70 years, [[and **increased**]{.mark} risk of
**[conflict]{.mark}** at a time when the major problems facing human
society have become more complex and can only be addressed through
greater coop]{.underline}eration---not confrontation.

[[It is through]{.mark} a **functioning** and **trusted
[multilat]{.mark}**]{.underline}eral system [that [we have the best hope
of **averting trade wars**]{.mark},]{.underline} **[[nuclear
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[environmental
disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[financial crises,]{.underline}** and
the spread of **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as well as building
defences for cybersecurity, and strengthening our capacity to deal with
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[food
disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} **widespread
[migration]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Yet [it is [this]{.mark} global order]{.underline}, that the U.S. did so
much to help build, that [[is]{.mark} now **[under]{.mark}** direct
[**attack** by]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration which sees international cooperation not as a
positive-sum game where all benefit but as a zero-sum game in which the
U.S. is depicted as the inevitable loser while others "win.\"

"**[It is a critical moment]{.underline}**," Macron warned a U.S.
Congress that gave him a succession of rousing ovations. "If we do not
act with urgency as a global community, I am convinced that the
international institutions, including the United Nations and NATO, will
no longer be able to exercise a mandate and stabilizing influence." His
list could have included the World Trade Organization, the International
Monetary Fund, and even the G20, as well as global pacts including the
Paris agreement on climate change, all of which are threatened in one
way or another by America First.

[What is at stake]{.underline}, Macron said, [is the liberal order that
has guided world economic development and averted major wars since
1945.]{.underline} "Other powers with the strongest strategy and
ambition will then fill the void we would leave empty. Other powers will
not hesitate again to advocate their own model to shape the 21st
century," Macron warned, adding---to cheers from the U.S. Congress---"I
do not share the fascination for new strong powers, the abandonment of
freedom, and the illusion of nationalism."

Instead, he urged, we must strengthen international cooperation. "We can
build the 21st century world order based on a new breed of
multilateralism, based on a more effective, accountable and
results-oriented multilateralism, a strong multilateralism," arguing
that multilateralism is the best way to defend freedom, peace and
progress.

This is probably the strongest direct challenge to the America First
foreign policy of the Trump administration delivered so far by any
foreign leader, and it was delivered where it really counts, on the
floor of the U.S. Congress. But it is only a beginning. Other countries,
including **[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[need to]{.mark}
vigorously [**reinforce the message** and **rally**]{.mark} [to a
**defence** of our]{.mark} multilateral **[institutions]{.mark}** and
their intellectual underpinnings.]{.underline}

Macron is far from alone in fearing the risks to an international
rules-based global order and a decline in Western values including
freedom and democracy. The World Economic Forum's 2018 edition of its
Global Risks Report, for example, warns that while the world faces [a
growing list of geopolitical risks]{.underline}, these [are]{.underline}
"[exacerbated by the continuing decline in commitment to rules-based
multilat]{.underline}eralism," adding that "the erosion of institutions
of multilateral dialogue and decision-making damages the prospects of
reaching new global agreements at a time when the need for cooperation
looks more urgent than ever,"

Or as the World Economic Forum's chairman, Klaus Schwab, has put it,
"this generation enjoys unprecedented technological, scientific and
financial resources, which we should use to chart a course towards a
more sustainable, equitable and inclusive future. And yet this is the
first generation to take the world to the brink of systems breakdown."

Yet we Canadians seem to have an out-of-touch view of our role in the
global community, one which is disconnected from the most urgent
problems facing the world, if the recent Canada's World Survey,
conducted by the Environics Institute for Survey Research is any guide.
The survey found that the majority of Canadians believe we are playing a
growing role in the world community. But absent is recognition of the
importance of the multilateral system.

"[Canadians continue to view their country as a positive and influential
voice in the world, one that can serve as a role model for other
countries]{.underline}," with "multiculturalism, diversity and inclusion
are increasingly seen by Canadians as their country's most notable
contribution to the world,\" the Environics survey reported. And close
to half of Canadians believe [[Canada can **strengthen its
influence**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world, the survey found.
"[[Areas of]{.mark} greatest potential [impact]{.mark} [include]{.mark}

#### Seperatism's [back on the menu]{.underline}. Defense is [dated]{.underline} and [wrong]{.underline}.

Institute (Duncan, 9-24-2024, \"Opinion: It's b-a-a-ck. Quebec
separatism rears its head again,\" Financial Post,
https://financialpost.com/opinion/quebec-separatism-back)

As if productivity, growth, housing and health care weren't challenges
enough for Canada, [[an **old threat** is]{.mark} quietly
**[re-emerging]{.mark}**: **[Quebec
separatism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The]{.underline} Parti
Québécois (**[PQ]{.underline}**), headed for government, [is promising
another referendum. The gathering storm **demands
attention**]{.underline}.

In the 2018 Quebec provincial election the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ)
handed the PQ an historic defeat, reducing it to just 10 seats. The
decades-long debate over Quebec's place in Canada was widely assumed to
have been settled, at least for this generation. But six years later the
PQ is ahead in polls and its charismatic young leader promises to hold a
referendum on sovereignty if elected. If an election were held today,
the PQ would likely form a majority government.

That the number of Quebecers who identify as mainly sovereigntist has
not changed much over the years is not a huge comfort. [As long as an
elected PQ is determined to hold a referendum, Canada's unity is at
risk.]{.underline}

[**Several [new factors complicate the situation]{.mark}**. A major
concern is the potential for **foreign interference**]{.underline}. In
the digital age, [[**external actors** can influence public opinion
through social media and misinfo]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation. We have
already seen election interference in federal elections. [[A
**referendum**]{.mark} on a single question [would be]{.mark} far
**[easier to influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Nations **hostile** to
western values]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and they know who they are ---
[[would see]{.mark} the **[fracturing]{.mark}** of [a G7 country as
a]{.mark} **significant** geopolitical **[victory]{.mark}**. Canada's
[division would]{.mark} also **[weaken]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** alliance at a time of conflict. [Any
hope of Canada getting military spending to two per cent of GDP would be
dashed.]{.underline}

Quebec voters have twice rejected sovereignty, in 1980 by 60-40 but in
1995 by barely a percentage point. In both cases, the federalist
narrative was of a proud and successful Canada offering Quebec a bright
future within a large and prosperous country. Today, such a narrative
would be unpersuasive. [[A]{.mark} **stark [shift toward
pessimism]{.mark}** and negativity [in]{.mark} the tone and substance of
[public discussion has **weakened Canadian unity**]{.mark} generally
[and could **reduce resistance to separatism**]{.mark}, both inside and
outside Quebec.]{.underline}

[Some Canadians, exasperated by endless debates over sovereignty, might
be tempted to let Quebec go]{.underline} if its voters clearly wanted
that. [But the economic stakes are high.]{.underline} Quebec accounts
for about a fifth of Canada's GDP, and its economy is deeply integrated
with the rest of the country. In 2019, its interprovincial exports
totalled \$77.8 billion, while its imports from other provinces were
\$86.2 billion. Only Ontario had higher totals. Separation would disrupt
these ties, causing economic turmoil on both sides of any new border.
The Canadian dollar could also come under pressure, as the British pound
did after the Brexit vote.

Despite what's implied by some slick videos produced by the PQ, Quebec
would face daunting challenges as an independent nation, among them
losing net federal transfers, explicitly assuming its share of the
federal debt, and establishing its own currency, central bank and trade
agreements. The transition would likely lead to instability, affecting
businesses and citizens alike. Studies the C.D. Howe Institute published
on these questions in the early 1990s have stood the test of time and
could inspire a similar review of these issues today.

Another difference between now and 1995 is the evolution of opinion in
Alberta. Despite the province's complaints about Confederation, support
for Alberta separatism remains low. If Canada began to unravel, however,
more Albertans could imagine pastures would be greener if they followed
Quebec's lead.

Risks that are low in probability but high in consequence demand serious
attention. [The **[complacency]{.mark}** that assumes Quebec will always
remain part of Canada [is **dangerous**. A]{.mark} **renewed [push for
independence]{.mark}**[, fuelled by]{.mark} internal
[**dissatisfaction** and]{.mark} external [**meddling**, could have
**disastrous outcomes**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The geopolitics of North America have become complicated of late.
President Donald Trump wants to annex Greenland and has dismissed
Canada's prime minister as the mere "governor" of a potential
fifty-first state. He has made stopping illegal immigration at both the
United States' northern and southern borders a top priority and has
threatened massive tariffs that could disrupt established trade patterns
within the continent.

In addition to the uncertainty generated by the United States[, there
may be some unexpected turbulence coming from Canada as the
long-submerged issue of [Quebec **separatism begins to
resurface**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As an aside, those who oppose Quebec leaving Canada tend to use the term
"separatism," while those more sympathetic to it seemingly prefer
"independentism" or "sovereigntism." This article will use the terms
interchangeably.

How the Movement Has Progressed

[It has been over ten years since the]{.underline} Parti Québécois
(**[PQ]{.underline}**), [for which independence is a fundamental tenet,
governed the province]{.underline}. In the interim, the question of
Quebec becoming a sovereign state has largely disappeared from Canadian
political discourse and gone completely off the screen in Washington,
where policymakers, journalists, and think tank analysts have had no
shortage of other, more pressing issues to address.

However, [the **wheel appears to be turning once more**. [Quebec's
**current** premier]{.mark}, François Legault, has been a prickly
**nationalist**, always pushing for Canada's federal government to
devolve the maximum amount of money and power to the
province]{.underline} and aggressively defending the French language's
privileged position, but he has not pushed for outright separation.

[Once highly popular, he [lost]{.mark} public
[support]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result of scandals, broken promises
regarding infrastructure, a sluggish economy, and the generalized
anti-incumbent feeling that is now found in many countries.

With elections scheduled for no later than October of 2026, [[the
**PQ**,]{.mark} once given up for dead, [**may return to**
**power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially as [it is]{.mark} now
[headed by a dynamic young leader]{.mark}, Paul St. Pierre
[Plamondon]{.mark}, [who]{.mark} has [**pledged** to **hold an
independence referendum**]{.mark}, should he gain office]{.underline}.
That said, while **[[polls currently favor him]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
much can happen between now and Election Day and his victory is hardly
assured.

Lots of History Here

The issue of Quebec and its relationship with English-speaking Canada
has been fraught ever since the colony of New France was ceded to
Britain in 1763 under the Treaty of Paris which ended the Seven Years'
War. Both under British rule and after the creation of Canada as a
self-governing dominion in 1867, the role of the French language and the
civil law system in Quebec was maintained.

Through the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century, Quebec
remained a relatively inward-looking society, dominated by local
French-speaking political elites, an English-speaking Montreal-based
business class, and the Catholic Church, which had a tight grip on
education and social norms.

However, by the 1960s, Quebec had broken away from its long stagnation
and had become an increasingly urbanized, educated, and secular society.
The province underwent the so-called "Quiet Revolution" in which its
leaders pressed forward with significant modernization reforms,
including the nationalization of the power generation sector and the
construction of huge hydro-electric dams, the expansion of the
university system, and the creation of extensive state pension and
medical insurance systems.

This was coupled with the emergence of a new, self-confident,
French-speaking business class.

While the leaders who sponsored these developments did so within the
framework of Canada's existing confederation, the idea that the people
of Quebec should be "maîtres chez nous"---masters in our own
home---began to evolve into demands for outright independence.

The independence movement had a violent far-left fringe in the "Front de
Libération du Québec" (FLQ), which took its inspiration from such
sources as the Algerian War of Independence against France and the Cuban
Revolution.

The FLQ's efforts as an urban guerrilla movement began with bombing
attacks against government and business installations and culminated in
the 1970 kidnapping of a British commercial diplomat and the provincial
minister of labor, who was ultimately killed by the group. These acts of
terrorism, however, proved to be the FLQ's undoing as the federal
government, led by Pierre Trudeau, moved decisively against it, breaking
up its cells and controversially putting troops onto the streets of
Montreal.

While the FLQ's violent extremism was rejected by Quebec's public, the
Parti Québécois (PQ), which combined commitment to independence with an
affinity for European-style social democracy, had real success, becoming
a major political force. In 1976, it gained control of Quebec's National
Assembly, and its leader, a longtime sovereignty advocate René Lévesque,
served as premier through 1985.

Following this, the PQ went into opposition. As federalist leaders
governed Quebec, it returned to power under three different leaders from
1994 to 2003 and again from 2012 to 2014. Thereafter, it lost impetus,
at least until recently.

Despite Quebec voters having voted the PQ into office at different
times, they have rejected independence on the two occasions in which it
was put to them in referenda. The first time, in 1980, it was decisively
defeated, 59.56 percent to 40.44 percent. It was defeated again in 1995,
although this time by a hair's breadth margin, 50.58 percent to 49.42
percent.

Those who currently see independence as unlikely note that support for
it has been stagnant for years at around thirty-five percent and that
younger voters do not seem enthused by the prospect.

Back to the Future

However, opinion leaders in English-speaking [Canada]{.underline} may be
beginning to fear that they [will have to **confront the issue** of
Quebec separatism anew]{.underline}. This concern has been laid out most
extensively in an October 2024 article by Gerald Butts in The Walrus, a
Canadian journal of opinion. Butts served as Justin Trudeau's principal
advisor from 2015 to 2019 and is now vice chairman of the Eurasia Group,
a New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy.

Butts is aware that [[independence **currently** lacks]{.mark} majority
[support]{.mark} within Quebec.]{.underline}

**[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[he makes the analogy to]{.mark}
the referendum in which **[British voters]{.mark}** favored **[leaving
the E]{.mark}**uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion]{.underline}, where "(T)he
**[['Remain']{.underline}]{.mark}** side **[[was swept
away]{.underline}]{.mark}**... by a colorful, boisterous" 'Leave' team.
Butts worries that, even though, in his view, Canada is one of the
world's great success stories, ["(a)s was the case with Britain in the
run-up to **Brexit**, Canada's mood is unrelentingly grim]{.underline}."

He fears that as a result, [[**unlike** in]{.mark} 19[95]{.mark}, where
there was a massive grassroots effort by English-speaking Canadians to
persuade Quebec voters that their presence in Canada was greatly valued,
[a]{.mark} sour "**[let them go]{.mark}**" [tone **might
prevail**]{.mark}]{.underline}, aggravated by "angry tirades... \[by\]
keyboard warriors." Butts also suggests that [**[Russian
disinfo]{.mark}**rmation operations [may have]{.mark} had [a]{.mark}
[**role** in Brexit and could have one in]{.mark} the lead-up to a
referendum in [Quebec]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, what is certain is that within Canada, a PQ victory would put
independence back at the center of national debate, making it all the
more difficult for the country to deal with the range of other issues it
faces, such as fixing its persistently sluggish economic growth and low
productivity, balancing its commitment to environmental protection with
the importance of its energy and mining sectors, and maintaining its
place in a world in which great power competition is making
international relations ever more complex.

Lots to Untangle

[An actual victory for independence]{.underline} in a referendum [would
provoke enormous constitutional, economic, and political
issues]{.underline}. First of all, in response to a ruling by Canada's
Supreme Court that Quebec had no right to secede unilaterally,
Parliament passed the "Clarity Act" in 2000, which required that any
vote in favor of independence be by a "clear majority," and that the
wording in any question be explicit in calling for Quebec's secession.

[This raises the question of what would happen if Quebec's voters
supported independence only by a narrow majority or if the wording of
the question was considered to be ambiguous.]{.underline} If Canada's
federal government rejected such a result, [would Quebec declare
independence unilaterally anyway? What would happen
afterward?]{.underline}

And if, in fact, Quebec convincingly voted for independence, complex
negotiations would be required on such economic issues as the division
of federal assets within Quebec and the share of Canada's national debt
that it would assume, whether Quebec would maintain a common central
bank and currency with what remained of Canada, and how their trade
relations would be managed.

Political issues to be resolved could include how an independent Quebec
would address the rights of Indigenous peoples that are currently
guaranteed by the federal government, as well as the rights of
non-Quebec citizens living in the new state and even Quebec's borders,
as it has never recognized that Labrador, to its northeast, is part of a
different province.

What Would the United States Do?

However, a PQ victory would also pose policy choices for the United
States. When, in 1995, it appeared that Quebec voters might support
independence, Bill Clinton made clear his support for, "a strong and
united Canada," doubtless seeing little benefit for U.S. interests from
the complications that would arise from the break-up of its northern
neighbor and the establishment of a new state on its borders.

In saying this, he was following in the footsteps of Jimmy Carter, who
won office in 1976, almost simultaneously with Quebec's first PQ
premier, René Lévesque. Carter made clear his "preference" for a united
Canada.

The unanswered questions for the United States could include whether an
independent Quebec would remain in NATO and, consequently, whether it
would create its armed forces to make at least some contribution to
Western defense at a time when American patience with perceived
free-riders on its military spending is wearing thin.

It would also need to determine if it would be part of the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).

Quebec has a 505-mile-long border with four American states; the United
States would want strong assurances that its interests in countering
illegal immigration, narcotics smuggling, and terrorism would be
respected. And, in one way or another, U.S. trade policy would have to
account for the presence of this new state.

However, if the PQ wins and a referendum on Quebec's separation becomes
a real prospect, would Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** feel the
same way as Presidents Carter and Clinton?

By inclination, he [[is a **disruptor**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **may
see an opportunity** in the uncertainty that a change in North America's
political geography could offer. [He might **support
independence**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[viewing the]{.mark}
small, newly created [state as **more likely to be responsive** to
American demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. [He may also believe [it could
offer him a]{.mark} greater [chance to **annex the rest of
Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline}, giving substance to his comments about it
becoming a fifty-first state.

Or, after stirring the pot sufficiently, he may decide, as did his
predecessors, that the status quo is preferable.

Whatever the outcome, [the return of the Quebec separatism issue would
surely add more twists and turns to the wild ride North America is
currently facing.]{.underline}

#### Separatism isn't [preordained]{.underline}, but it [is]{.underline} thinkable

**Patriquin 24**, Quebec correspondent (Martin, 4-10-2024, \"Quebec
separation re-enters political debate thanks to TikTok-friendly
leader,\" The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/10/quebec-canada-separatist-party)

[[Quebec separation is **back**]{.mark} **among the
living**]{.underline}.

[Years after many considered [it]{.mark} dead, the prospect of removing
Canada's second-most populous province]{.underline} from the federation
[[has re-entered the]{.mark} political [debate]{.mark}.]{.underline} And
[though [Quebecers]{.mark} aren't exactly marching in the
streets]{.underline} in its support as they once did, [[they]{.mark} are
certainly [**taking another look** at the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**arti **[[Q]{.underline}]{.mark}**uébécois.

[[The PQ]{.mark}, [formed]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1968 **[[expressly to
make a country]{.underline}]{.mark}** out of the province, [[is **by
far** the most popular]{.mark} political [party]{.mark} in the land,
with a bevy of polls suggesting it could form a majority government were
an election held today.]{.underline}

In October, the party won a byelection in the Quebec City-area riding of
Jean-Talon, long a stronghold of the governing Coalition Avenir Québec,
or CAQ. More recently, the PQ released its "year one" budget,
essentially an advertisement for the alleged economic benefits of a
sovereign Quebec.

[Yet [the PQ's resurgence has less to do with]{.mark} a revival of
[separatist spirits than its leader]{.mark}, Paul St-Pierre
Plamondon]{.underline}. Elected party leader in the doldrums of 2020,
the gen X St-Pierre Plamondon is a contrast to the PQ's boomer-dominated
constituency.

St-Pierre [Plamondon]{.underline} is novel for other reasons. He [speaks
often and loudly about the act of separation itself, even musing about
creating a standing army and printing a Québécois currency]{.underline}.
It's a marked difference from many PQ leaders before him, who often
avoided speaking about the issue for fear of alienating voters. Nor is
St-Pierre Plamondon above often-**[cringeworthy]{.underline}** TikTok
meme attempts extolling the delights of a separate Quebec.

Yet [if the PQ is the choix du jour for an increasing number of
Quebecers, it's [also]{.mark} due to [the political collapse of the
current]{.mark} CAQ [government]{.mark}]{.underline}. Elected in 2018,
the caquistes, as they're known, promised to bring an end to the
decades-long obsession with Quebec separation. Led by the longtime
separatist (and former PQ cabinet minister) François Legault, the party
bills itself as an economy-first coalition of federalists and
souverainistes -- the preferred term for those who want to make Quebec a
country -- disillusioned by a half-century of debates over Quebec's
place in Canada.

It worked, in that the CAQ has formed two majority governments since
2018. As recently as 2022, Legault was among the country's most popular
premiers for his handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Yet [a series of
missteps and scandals have caused his party to plummet back to earth,
particularly in its centre of support in the Quebec City
region]{.underline}.

Legault reneged on a campaign promise to build an underground tunnel
connecting Quebec City with its car-obsessed suburbs to the south. The
party was caught peddling access to several CAQ ministers in exchange
for donations. And the government paid as much as \$7m to bring the Los
Angeles Kings to Quebec City to play a game, thinking city dwellers
would be chuffed to watch two pre-season NHL games some 30 years years
after the city's cherished Quebec Nordiques moved away. Instead, they
were outraged at the price tag.

The PQ's byelection win last October confirmed a trend illustrated by 11
polls over the last year, said analyst Philippe Fournier. "It's very
linear," said Fournier, founder of the poll aggregator 338canada.com.
"[The [PQ is]{.mark} directly [benefiting from]{.mark} the [collapse in
CAQ support]{.mark}]{.underline}."

#### Trump won't fracture NATO:

#### 1\-\--NATO Secretary General Rutte [agrees]{.underline} on [increasing]{.underline} defense spending. That solves worries of [abandonment]{.underline}.

Secretary General says," USA TODAY,

WASHINGTON − [The **new** **[head of NATO]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} President Donald [**[Trump]{.mark}**
**[agree]{.mark}**]{.underline} on one thing: [[Europe]{.mark}an member
states [should be **paying more**]{.mark} for their
defense]{.underline}.

Seated next to Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, NATO Secretary
General Mark **[[Rutte]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a former prime minister
of the Netherlands, [**[credited]{.mark}** [the president]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} [making]{.mark} NATO [members **contribute more**]{.mark}
for military support.]{.underline}

\"If we look at Trump 47, [[what happened]{.mark} in the last couple of
weeks [is]{.mark} **really [staggering]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Rutte
said of recent defense commitments. \"[The Europeans [countries are
spending a package of]{.mark} \$**[800 billion]{.mark}** on defense
spending]{.underline}.\"

Rutte then nodded along as Trump recalled demanding that NATO nations
pay up their fair share during his first term as president.

\"When I first went to NATO, my first meeting, I noticed that very few
people were paying, and if they were, they weren\'t paying their fair
share,\" Trump said.

[[After making it **clear**]{.mark} that [U.S]{.mark}. [wouldn\'t
support]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} [if]{.mark} member [states]{.mark}
[didn\'t step up]{.mark},]{.underline} \"**[the [money started pouring
in]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" Trump said.

Rutte\'s visit to the White House comes as Russia is considering a
ceasefire deal agreed to by Ukraine, three years after it invaded the
country.

\"Now we have to use it wisely,\" Trump said of Europe\'s defense
spending, \"and we have to get this war over with that, you\'ll be back
to a normal, much more normal life.\"

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that he would be
willing to step down if Ukraine were granted membership in NATO, but
Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have said
Ukraine won\'t be joining the military alliance. Russia staunchly
opposes the move, which it sees as an eastward expansion of NATO.

Trump has repeatedly expressed his contention that European countries
are taking advantage of the U.S. defense umbrella and should be paying
more than double what they currently are required to pay for their
military defense.

In 2014, NATO members committed to spending 2% of their Gross Domestic
Product or economic output in the wake of Russia's annexation of
Ukraine's Crimea region.

The U.S. contributes 3.4% of its GDP and about 16% of NATO\'s annual
budget. Poland is in top place, contributing 4.1% of its GDP, followed
by Estonia and the U.S, both at 3.4%, according to the Council on
Foreign Relations.

By 2024, all non-U.S. NATO allies spent the 2% target on average for the
first time. Twenty-three out of the 32 total member countries will meet
or exceed the 2% target, including France and Germany, according to the
Council on Foreign Relations.

Zelenskyy said he would step down to join NATO

"[They could all **afford it,** but they should be at **5%**, **not
2%,"**]{.underline} said Trump said in January.

Last month, the U.K., which currently spends 2.3% of its GDP, pledged to
increase its defense outlay to 2.5% by 2027.

[During a speech to NATO members in December **[Rutte]{.mark}**
[said]{.mark} the **[2%]{.mark}** commitment [was **not
enough**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

"[I can tell you, [we]{.mark} are going to [need **a lot more**]{.mark}
**than 2%**," he said. "[**If** we don't spend]{.mark} [**more
together** now to **prevent war**]{.mark}**,** [we will **pay a
much**]{.mark}, **[much]{.mark}**, **[much]{.mark}** [**higher price
later** to **fight it**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

NATO, but Europe must spend more on defence," *Reuters*,

BRUSSELS, April 3 (Reuters) - U.S. [**Secretary** of
**State**]{.underline} Marco **[[Rubio]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[told]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} allies]{.underline} on Thursday [that
[Washington **remained committed**]{.mark} to the alliance [but expected
them to spend]{.mark} **far [more]{.mark}** [on
**defence**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and would give them some **time** to
do so.]{.underline}

Rubio spoke as he met fellow NATO foreign ministers gathered in
Brussels, with some [[European officials]{.mark} saying they [were
**reassured**]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the [renewed **commitment**]{.mark} to
the alliance [at a time of]{.mark}]{.underline} rising tensions over
President Donald [Trump\'s new trade **[tariffs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The Trump administration\'s words and actions over the past months have
raised questions about the future of NATO, the transatlantic alliance
that has been the bedrock of European security for the past 75 years.

[[Rubio]{.mark} **[dismissed doubts]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} U.S.
[commitment]{.mark} to the alliance as \"**hysteria**.\"]{.underline}

\"The United States is in NATO \... [The]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
as]{.mark} **[active]{.mark}** in NATO [as it has **ever**]{.mark}
**been**]{.underline},\" he told reporters.

\"[[He is **not against**]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Rubio
said of Trump. \"[He is against]{.underline} a [NATO that does not have
the **capabilities** that it needs to **fulfil** the **obligations**
that the treaty imposes]{.underline} upon each and every member state.\"

[Trump has said the military alliance should spend **5%** of **g**ross
**d**omestic **p**roduct on defence]{.underline} -- a huge increase from
the current 2% goal and a level that no NATO country, including the
United States, currently reaches.

Washington has also bluntly told European countries that it can no
longer be primarily focused on the continent's security.

European allies have been anxiously seeking details on the timeframe and
extent to which the U.S. aims to reduce its engagement in NATO for
weeks, in order to coordinate the process of a European defence ramp-up
to avoid security gaps in Europe.

SPEND MORE

In Brussels, Rubio brought some element of response on that.

\"[We]{.underline} do [want to leave here with an understanding that [we
are on a]{.mark} pathway]{.underline}, [a **[realistic]{.mark}**
**[pathway]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[to **every single**]{.mark} **one**
of the [member]{.mark}s **[committing]{.mark}** and **fulfilling** a
promise]{.underline} to reach up to 5% of spending,\" he said, adding
that this included the United States.

\"[[No one expects]{.mark} that you\'re going to be able [to do this in
**one** year or **two**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[path]{.mark}way [has to be **real**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

[A **[European official]{.mark}**]{.underline}, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, [[said]{.mark} [the meeting]{.mark} with Rubio
[was]{.mark} \"**[very]{.mark} [reassuring]{.mark}.**\"]{.underline}

\"[The [meeting]{.mark} [was not
**confrontational**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" the official said.
\"[[Just]{.mark} that [allies]{.mark} [need to **do more**]{.mark}.
**[No]{.mark} [bashing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

Still, reaching 5% of GDP spending on defence would be hard for many
NATO allies.

According to NATO estimates, some of the continent's big economies, such
as Italy and Spain, are among those below the current 2% target, at
around 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. Twenty-three of the alliance's 32
members met or exceeded the 2% target last year.

\"For the time being, I think 5% is probably too high,\" Portuguese
Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel told reporters, noting that Portugal --
which spent 1.55% of GDP on defence last year - first needs to get to 2%
and then have a plan to meet a new target the alliance will set at its
next summit.

#### Polish Foreign Minister proves.

**Reuters 3-4**, \*News Organization, (\*Reuters, April 4, 2025, "Poland
says Trump committed to NATO and will be at Hague summit,"
https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-says-trump-committed-nato-will-be-hague-summit-2025-04-04/)

WARSAW, April 4 (Reuters) - United States President Donald [[Trump
**remains committed**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}\'s **A**rticle
**5** on mutual defence and [will be **present** at]{.mark} a **NATO
[summit]{.mark}** in **The Hague** [in June]{.mark}, **[Polish Foreign
Minister]{.mark}**]{.underline} Radoslaw
**[[Sikorski]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[told]{.mark} [reporters]{.mark} in
Brussels]{.underline} on Friday.

Trump\'s security policies have undermined old certainties in Europe
that the United States would come to its aid if it was attacked, leading
some to question Washington\'s commitment to the principle of mutual
defence.

However, [at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in
Brussels]{.underline}, U.S. Secretary of State Marco [**Rubio** told
**allies** on Thursday that Washington **remained committed** to the
alliance]{.underline} [but expected them to spend **far more** on
**defence** and would give them some time to do so.]{.underline}

[[Asked at the summit]{.mark} [whether]{.mark} [he]{.mark}
[believed]{.mark} that [the U.S. remained **committed**]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} **[defending]{.mark}** **[NATO]{.mark}** territory,
**[Sikorski]{.mark}** [replied]{.mark}
\"**[yes]{.mark}**\".]{.underline}

\"[President [**Trump** **confirmed** it to the
**leaders**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it is still **valid** and from what
we hear President Trump will be **present** at the **summit** in The
Hague]{.underline},\" he added.

NATO leaders meet in the Dutch city from June 24 to 26.

#### It's just a [bluster]{.underline} for [increased spending]{.underline}, returning to [business as usual]{.underline} is [guaranteed]{.underline}.

survive without the United States?," *CNN*,
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/nato-ukraine-survive-without-united-states-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html)

What comes next?

Some hope that [the talk of a US [**withdrawal** from NATO]{.mark} [is
just Trump **bluster**]{.mark} aimed [at]{.mark} pushing [allies to
**cough up**]{.mark} and **spend [more]{.mark}** [on
defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}

They say [[the **world**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} another **[key US
alliance]{.mark}**, [have been here **before**]{.mark}]{.underline} --
[during [Trump]{.mark}'s first administration, when he reportedly
[asked]{.mark} the **[Pentagon]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [look at]{.mark}
options for **[drawing down]{.mark}** US **[troops]{.mark}** stationed
[in **So**]{.mark}**uth [Ko]{.mark}rea**]{.underline} as protection
against nuclear-armed North Korea.

That came as Trump prepared for meetings with North Korean dictator Kim
Jong Un at which he hoped to persuade Kim to commit to giving up his
nuclear arsenal.

[A source **close** to the **White House** told CNN at the time that a
US **troop** **pullout** was viewed as something that could possibly
happen in the future but]{.underline} "[not until long
after]{.underline} ([North Korea's]{.underline}) [nukes are **verifiably
gone**]{.underline}."

But **[Kim]{.underline}** [**rejected** all entreaties]{.underline} for
him to give up his nuclear weapons program.

The Trump-Kim meeting "was sold as a big success despite that fact that
it wasn't," said Schreer.

[Afterward]{.underline}, [the [US returned to]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[business as usual]{.underline}]{.mark}**" on the Korean Peninsula,
Schreer said. [The **US**]{.underline} -- [with **[tens of
thousands]{.mark}** of [troops]{.mark} in South Korea]{.underline} --
[**[kept]{.mark} them** [there]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[**[Bilateral]{.mark} [exercises]{.mark}** with Seoul's forces
**[resumed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [US [**warships** **visited**]{.mark}
South Korean [ports]{.mark} [and]{.mark} US **[Air Force]{.mark}**
[bombers **flew over**]{.mark} the region.]{.underline}

[The **[same]{.mark}** [could occur in **Europe**]{.mark} [if Trump
doesn't]{.mark} [get what he wants from **Putin**]{.mark}]{.underline},
analysts said. [NATO could **go on**, with the [recent threats]{.mark}
to depart [just a **small bump**]{.mark} in the road]{.underline}.

"If Putin tries to ... screw Donald too much, even Donald Trump might
recognize that," Schreer said.

4.1 Race to Sell Oil

[[In response to]{.mark} the threat of **[peak]{.mark} oil
[demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[producer countries could]{.mark}
[**battle it out**,]{.mark} fight for market share,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} try to [**[sell]{.mark} as much** of [their
oil]{.mark} now **[before demand declines]{.mark}** as a result of a
switch to **clean**]{.underline}er **[energy]{.underline}** sources.
[[This is a strategy]{.mark} that **low-cost producers** like
**[Saudi]{.mark}**]{.underline} Arabia [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} be
tempted to [[pursue]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, in March 2020, the
Saudi Ministry of Energy instructed Saudi Aramco to increase its
production capacity from 12 to 13 mb/d (Saudi Aramco, 2020). [Saudi
Aramco's]{.underline} April 2019 [bond prospectus]{.underline}, released
ahead of its initial public offering, [reads like a strategy to be
the]{.underline} "[last man standing]{.underline}" [in the oil
market]{.underline} (Krane, 2021). Similarly, the United Arab Emirates'
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) had plans to increase its
production capacity to 5 mb/d, up from 3.1 mb/d in October 2018 (Kerr,
2018).

The idea here is that [[**climate policy** and the **anticipated
depreciation** of reserves]{.underline} [**undermines** incentives to
**leave oil in the ground**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, instead [provoking
a]{.mark} "**[panic and pump]{.mark}**" **[strategy]{.mark}** to
monetize as much of those reserves **before** the window
closes]{.underline}. It is also built on a belief that [oil will
**remain indispensable** for some time to come, and that NOCs may be at
an advantage compared to international oil co]{.underline}mpanies, which
face mounting pressure from shareholders, courts, and public opinion.
However, by [rushing to develop reserves and make the most out of what
could be the last oil boom, [**price wars** may
**erupt**]{.mark}]{.underline} between oil exporters, thus
[**[depressing prices]{.mark}** and revenues for all. [It could lead
to]{.mark} "**[green paradox]{.mark}**" **[effects]{.mark}**,
[where]{.mark}by [lower oil prices **slow**]{.mark}]{.underline} down
**[[the]{.mark} energy [transition]{.mark}]{.underline}** itself (Sinn,
2012). Moreover, [rapacious oil extraction is a short-term strategy
which does not improve long-term prospects for growth]{.underline} (van
der Ploeg, 2016).

### Green Paradox\-\--AT: Long-Term Contracts\-\--2NC

#### Plants can accelerate processing [even]{.underline} when locked into [long-term contracts]{.underline}.

**Grant 8-30**-2024, PhD, Professor of Sociology and Fellow of the
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute at the University of Colorado
Boulder. (Don, *et al*, "A worldwide analysis of stranded fossil fuel
assets' impact on power plants' CO2 emissions," Nature Communications,
Volume 15, p. 2, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52036-8.pdf)

To date, [the study that comes closest to generating]{.underline} such
[evidence is [Di Maria]{.mark} et al]{.underline}.24 [empirical
examination of whether]{.underline} U.S. power [plants emitted more
sulfur dioxide]{.underline} (SO2) [between]{.underline} the
[announcement of]{.underline} the [Acid Rain]{.underline} Program
[and]{.underline} its [implementation]{.underline}. Consistent with the
green paradox thesis, [they [found]{.mark}]{.underline} that owners of
coal deposits responded to this program by extracting more coal and
selling it at a cheaper price. However, contrary to that thesis, price
decreases had no effect on plants' SO2 emissions, which the authors
attribute to the fact that [most [plants are **locked** into
**long-term**]{.mark}]{.underline} coal [**[purchases]{.mark}** that
prevent them from taking advantage of changes in spot
pricing.]{.underline}

Although their study casts doubt on the green paradox hypothesis, [**[Di
Maria]{.mark}** et al]{.underline}. also **[[overlook several
factors]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that]{.underline} beg further
investigation and [suggest]{.underline} how [climate policies might
still inadvertently increase emissions]{.underline}. Besides not
examining the CO2 emissions of power plants in the U.S. and throughout
the world, [their study does not measure the value of a nation's fossil
fuel assets that are at-risk of being **stranded**]{.underline}.
Instead, it examines whether the effect of coal prices on emissions
changes as the Acid Rain program came closer to being implemented.
Hence, it does not capture how at-risk assets are distributed unevenly
across the globe and threaten to disrupt the economies of some countries
more than others. In addition, [Di Maria et al. confined their study to
large, base-load plants that operate at full capacity almost all the
time]{.underline}. Consequently, it does not explore how [other
[plants]{.mark} may **[adjust their capacity]{.mark}
factor**]{.underline}25 [[when]{.mark} many of the **[reserves]{.mark}**
they have **already purchased** are [in peril]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In this work, [[we use a **worldwide dataset**]{.mark} on]{.underline}
individual [power plants' CO2 emission levels]{.underline} (annual
tonnes of CO2 emitted)26, their operational characteristics, and the
value of their countries' potentially stranded fossil fuel reserves27 to
fill these gaps [and conduct an **empirical analysis** of the effects of
at-risk fossil fuel assets on plants' carbon pollution under a 1.5
°C]{.underline} (and, in Supplementary Table 1, 2 °C) climate
stabilization scenario. [We test two]{.underline} simple, alternative
[models of the **green paradox**]{.underline}. [The first predicts that
plants will pollute at higher levels in countries with more at-risk
fossil fuel reserves]{.underline} because those countries are more
likely to exercise regulatory leniency to soften the otherwise
disruptive effects of stranded assets on government revenues,
employment, and energy security. Such [leniency allows plants to **defer
maintenance**]{.underline}, **[exploit loopholes]{.underline}** in
environmental regulation, [and delay adopting **cleaner
tech**]{.underline}nologies, all of which directly add to a plant's
carbon pollution. [The second model assumes that most plants are
**locked** into **long-term fossil**]{.underline} fuel
**[contracts]{.underline}** and many of the fuels they have acquired are
derived from their host country's carbon reserves. [It
predicts]{.underline} that [in countries with more at-risk assets,
[plants]{.mark}]{.underline} have a vested interest in
**[[shift]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing the [[**processing** of **fossil
fuels forward** to capitalize on]{.mark} their purchases of **coal**,
**[oil]{.mark}**, [and **gas**]{.mark} and use their plant equipment
while they]{.underline} still [**can**. [By incentivizing plants to
**speed up**]{.mark} **their [operations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e.,
[increase their capacity utilization rate]{.underline}) in this way,
[[stranded assets]{.underline}]{.mark} indirectly [[cause]{.mark}
plants' [emissions to **rise**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Joskow28 provides
several examples of how [[plants **subject to long-term contracts**
can]{.mark} **effectively [accelerate]{.mark}** the **[burning]{.mark}**
of already purchased fuels [by **renegotiating quantity
provisions**]{.mark}]{.underline} at dates specified within these
agreements. Consistent with our two predictions, [findings]{.underline}
here [indicate]{.underline} that [not only do power plants release more
CO2 [in countries where]{.mark} more fossil fuel [assets are in
jeopardy]{.mark} of being stranded, but]{.underline} in those same
countries, [[plants]{.mark} also [operate **closer to**]{.mark} **full
[capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, causing them to emit CO2 at even
higher levels. Results thus point to countries' regulatory leniency and
plants' vested interest in their long-term contracts as the mechanisms
that might lead to a green paradox. Unlike most past studies that rely
on simulation methods, our study also uses a hierarchical linear model
(HLM) that rejects specifications that cannot reproduce observations and
estimates the magnitude of parameters29. This technique allows us not
just to empirically assess whether at-risk assets are associated with
plants' emissions, but also to calculate the total volume of CO2 that
plants emit in response to those assets. Results suggest that in the
case of countries like the United States and Russia, the extra emissions
attributed to the stranded asset effect exhaust a significant percent of
their electricity sectors' remaining carbon budgets.

**[[Oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark}** this week [[found support with

**[election]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**[OPEC+\'s]{.underline}**
[decision to delay]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [production increase]{.mark},

were seen as bullish for energy. However, by week's end, it was known
that Hurricane Rafael\'s impact on oil supply would be minimal, that
inventories had increased, and that demand concerns re-emerged.

The ups-and-downs of the US dollar also added to the volatility while
the Middle East conflicts appeared to take a backseat. WTI saw a
High/Low range of \$72.90-\$69.75/bbl while Brent's range was
\$76.25-\$73.35. The Brent/WTI has tightened to -\$3.80/Bbl. [[Both

global oil [prices through the first quarter]{.mark} of next
year]{.underline}, the EIA said. However, it warned that members of the
group could be growing weary of the cuts, which have been in place for
more than two years.

\"Although we assess that OPEC+ producers will likely continue to limit
production below recently announced targets in 2025, the potential for

### UQ\-\--AT: Peak Oil Demand\-\--2NC

#### Renewable growth [only]{.underline} supplants fossil fuels if it's accompanied by a carbon tax. 

**Porter 14**, Economics reporter for the business section of The New
York Times. (Eduardo, 11-18-2014, \"A Carbon Tax Could Bolster Green
Energy\". *NY Times*,
https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/business/economy/a-carbon-tax-could-bolster-wobbly-progress-in-renewable-energy.html)

But [for all the optimism generated by **[cheaper
renewable]{.mark}**]{.underline} fuel[**[s]{.mark}**, they **[do
not]{.mark}**, [**on their own**, put the world on the **low-carbon
path**]{.mark}]{.underline} necessary to keep climate change in check.

[Progress is **faltering**]{.underline} on several fronts. [The
precipitous fall in the prices of photovoltaic cells]{.underline} from
2008 to 2012 pretty much [stopped]{.underline} in 2013, [after **rapid
consolidation**]{.underline} of the industry.

The International Energy Agency now projects that installed global
nuclear capacity in 2025 will fall 5 percent, to 24 percent below what
will be needed to stay on the safe side of climate change. And **[carbon
capture technologies]{.underline}**, which will be essential if the
world is to keep consuming any form of fossil fuel, [remain **hampered
by high costs, meager investment** and **scant political
commitment**]{.underline}.

"The unrelenting rise in coal use without deployment of carbon capture
and storage is fundamentally incompatible with climate change
objectives," noted the International Energy Agency in its Technology
Perspectives report.

Despite the falling costs of renewable energy in the United States, the
Energy Information Administration's baseline assumptions project that in
2040 only 16.5 percent of electricity generation will come from
renewable energy sources, up from some 13 percent today. More than
two-thirds will come from coal and gas. Without some carbon capture and
storage technology, drastic climate change is almost certainly
unavoidable.

What is necessary to get us on a safer path?

White House officials trust that the administration has the tools,
including fuel economy and appliance efficiency standards, [the
**[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}nvironmental
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**rotection
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**gency's new limits on power plant emissions
and regulations to limit other greenhouse gases.

Yet the Energy Information Administration's
**[[projections]{.underline}]{.mark}** suggest how hard the task will
be. Though they were developed before the Environmental Protection
Agency issued its new rules, they [[included hypothetical
outlines]{.underline}]{.mark} that could mimic some of its effects. In
one, coal power plants were decommissioned more quickly; in another,
subsidies to renewable energy were kept until 2040. In another, [[the
price of renewables **fell fast**]{.underline}]{.mark}er than expected.
**[[None]{.underline}]{.mark}** of them [[did much to **move the carbon
dial**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[There is **one tool available**]{.mark} to trim carbon emissions on a
**relevant scale:** [a **carbon tax**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} That
solution, however, remains off the table.

[[If]{.mark} a carbon tax were to be imposed]{.underline} next year,
starting at \$25 and rising by 5 percent a year, the Energy Information
Administration estimates, [carbon dioxide emissions from American power
plants would fall to]{.underline} only 419 million tons by 2040, about
**[one-fifth of where they are today.]{.underline}** Total carbon
dioxide emissions from energy in the United States would fall to 3.6
billion tons --- 1.8 billion tons less than today. [By providing a
monetary incentive, economists say, such [a tax would]{.mark} offer by
far the most effective way to **[encourage
business]{.mark}**]{.underline} and individuals [[to **reduce** their
use of fossil fuels]{.mark} and invest in alternatives]{.underline}.

#### Clean energy will grow, but [so will demand]{.underline}. Fossil fuels will [stick]{.underline}. 

**Wald 8-2**-2024, Energy Analyst, Breakthrough Institute; former policy
analyst and communications consultant at the Nuclear Energy Institute.
(Matthew L., \"Clean Energy May be Growing, But It's Not Replacing Dirty
Energy,\" Breakthrough Journal,
https://thebreakthroughjournal.substack.com/p/clean-energy-may-be-growing-but-its)

[Lots of people have high hopes for an energy transition, but they're
looking through the wrong end of the telescope]{.underline}.

[Yes, solar farms are spreading out]{.underline} over deserts and farm
fields, [and wind turbines are popping up]{.underline} all over the land
and even in a few locations offshore. But global consumption of fossil
fuels grew 1.5 percent last year, according to the Statistical Review of
World Energy. [[Clean energy is growing, but **so is demand**]{.mark},
and to meet it,]{.underline} [[**dirty energy** is growing too]{.mark}.
[**We're going to have to do things differently** if we hope to
**trim**]{.mark} the **[output]{.mark}** of climate-changing
emissions]{.underline}.

Even the fossil mix is getting worse; [[oil was up]{.mark} even
[**faster** than total fossil consumption, and demand
passed]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[100 million barrels a
day]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the first time. Coal also hit a new
record, and carbon emissions from energy consumption are up by 50
percent since the turn of the century. The fossil share of primary
energy slipped by 0.4 percent, to 81.5 percent, but the climate doesn't
care about percentages; it cares about volumes.

The Statistical Review of World Energy might be more familiar by its
older name, the BP Statistical Review. The recent history of BP
illustrates the waxing and waning of the idea of green energy. It used
to be "British Petroleum" but rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum" in
2001, and then reverted back to "BP" in 2006. It published the report, a
survey of all forms of energy production and consumption, for 70 years,
and the Statistical Review has always served as a useful guide to all
things oil.

But BP dropped the report in 2023. A spokesman for the company told
Reuters that BP wanted to give the report team more time to concentrate
on a shift to renewables and low-carbon energy. Now the report is funded
by BP, KPMG, and Kearney. It's still using the same methodology, and
some of the analysts who produce it have left BP to continue on the data
series.

The race to transition to zero emissions by mid-century was going to
have to be a sprint. Now it appears that [the starting gun has fired and
the runners are milling around in confusion.]{.underline}

"I would argue that [[the transition **hasn't even crossed the start
line**]{.underline}]{.mark}," said one of those analysts, Nick Wayth,
now the chief executive of the Energy Institute. He spoke at a briefing
on the report at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, DC.

The perception here in the United States is that renewable energy is
booming. The United States has ample capital, a strong industrial base
and a grid to plug into, plus government incentives. But in 2022, solar
and wind together produced about 13.66 percent of the kilowatt-hours in
the U.S.; in 2023, the last year for which full statistics are
available, they produced about 14.1 percent of U.S. electricity
generation. These numbers are strong but will leave us a long way from
zero at mid-century. And while U.S. greenhouse gas emissions may have
declined by 1.9 percent last year, global emissions increased by about
1.1 percent.

Why are emissions increasing? Because [[the **world is hungry**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} two things: [[**energy** and]{.mark} all the
**[manufactured goods]{.mark}** that consume energy]{.underline} (cars
and trucks, refrigerators, water pumps, cell phones, etc.).

#### Peak oil demand is [half a century]{.underline} away. 

**Messler 24**, oilfield veteran. Citing Arjun Murti, a former Goldman
Sachs energy analyst. (David, 5-6-2024, \"Why the IEA is Wrong About
Peak Oil Demand,\" OilPrice,
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-the-IEA-is-Wrong-About-Peak-Oil-Demand.html)
**\*BOPD = barrels of oil per day**

[It is fairly common]{.underline} nowadays [to see]{.underline}
relatively near-term [estimates for]{.underline} a point at which demand
for petroleum-based fuels begins to decline. The term often used to
describe this "tipping point" is **[Peak Oil Demand]{.underline}**. When
I say "near term," I mean right around the corner if you look at an
estimate published last year by the International Energy Agency-IEA, an
intergovernmental agency headquartered in Paris, France, and originally
established after the Oil Embargo of 1973 to help cushion against future
oil shocks. This agency has expanded its mission to a fairly broad remit
over the years since, and it is not the purpose of this article to
detail all its endeavors. One role we will highlight is that of the one
it plays in gauging and advising member governments on energy security
and energy sources for the coming years.

In that capacity, the IEA in a report entitled, Oil 2023, and published
last year settled on 2028 as the year past which the use of petroleum
fuels will begin to decline.

"Growth in the world's demand for oil is set to slow almost to a halt in
the coming years, with the high prices and security of supply concerns
highlighted by the global energy crisis hastening the shift towards
cleaner energy technologies, according to a new IEA report released
today."

This view is largely shared, particularly with respect to liquid motor
fuels, by other agencies and organizations that produce long range
estimates. The U.S. Energy Information Agency-EIA, Rystad, and Det
Norske Veritas- DNV, all show this category tailing off rapidly in the
2030s as electric vehicles assume larger shares of passenger vehicles.
We will call this the "Bear Case" for liquid fuels.

As you might expect the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries-OPEC, disagrees with this view. In fact in their recent report
on oil demand outlook, published in Nov 2023, they see oil demand of all
kinds, except for electricity generation, rising from \~105 mm BOPD in
2025, to 116 mm BOPD in 2045. This forecast show use of oil as a road
fuel continuing to be the largest source of demand increase for this
period.

The report notes that "the divergence between the IEA and OPEC outlooks
is largely due to assumptions regarding the speed at which internal
combustion engine vehicles will be replaced by electric vehicles."

What is interesting is that [[it is]{.mark} very difficult, if not
**[impossible]{.mark}**, [to see a]{.mark} production **[trend]{.mark}**
being established [that would **support** the **bear
case**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the U.S., [we are pumping]{.mark} at a
rate of over **[13]{.mark}.2 mm [BOPD]{.mark}** and still importing
\~6.7 mm BOPD]{.underline} to feed our nearly 22 mm BOPD daily habit.
The U.S. Energy Information Agency-EIA forecasts in their monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook-STEO that by the end of 2025, global
production and demand fall into a fairly tight balance at 105 mm BOPD.
That certainly isn't a long-term trend, but as is often said, the
long-term trend is made up of a bunch of short-term ones. For my part, I
would say that [the trend line in the STEO graph]{.underline} below
[matches the **OPEC estimate**]{.underline} more closely than the other
three.

Both of these notions cannot be true. Which is the correct assumption
about future oil demand? Or are they both wrong? What are two factors
these two disparate views of oil demand are not taking into account?

[The **[first]{.mark}** answer lies in how you interpret the [**growth**
of the **middle class** in **China**, **India**, and
Africa]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of energy demand and the final form
it will take. [The [**second** is]{.mark} the advent of]{.underline}
energy demand for Artificial Intelligence
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[an **entirely new** source of
**demand**]{.mark} that is just now starting to appear in energy
**demand forecasts**]{.underline}. I discussed one possible outcome of
this demand for U.S. natural gas in an article in March 2024.

To be clear, I am not arguing that AI demand will directly impact crude
oil demand as a primary source. Most analysts are factoring renewables
and natural gas to meet AI demand. What will impact demand for WTI and
other baskets of crude is the relationship to light oil production in
the U.S. and the associated gas that's produced along with it. We will
leave that discussion for a future article and refocus on our basic
topic. What could oil demand actually be when accounting for growth in
currently underserved but upwardly aspiring lower classes?

[Then there is the **Bull Case** for **oil**]{.underline}. Arjun Murti,
a well-known energy commentator and partner at energy analyst firm
Veriten, as well as a former Goldman Sachs energy analyst, discussed
future energy demand in a recent podcast on his Super-Spiked blog. In
the episode titled, "Everyone is Rich," Arjun posits what the impact on
world energy demand would be if everyone was as energy-rich as the
"Lucky," 1.2 billion people that live in the Western World. More
specifically, [Arjun asks what it would mean for the other 7 billion
people in China, India, Asia, and Africa to have the lifestyle that
Americans]{.underline}, Canadians, Europeans, [and a few other countries
enjoy]{.underline}. The answer he comes up with on an absolute basis,
250 mm BOPD, using a reference point of 10 bbls a year!

Where are we now? The U.S consumes \~22 bbls of oil annually per capita
while China consumes 3.7 bbls per capita. Indians use just 1.3 bbls per
annum. That's a pretty wide gap, and as Arjun notes, "economic [growth
and energy growth are **one and the same**]{.underline}. You do not get
economic growth without adequate energy."

[One of the arguments put forward by the **Peak Oil** crowd is that
efficiency growth]{.underline} Gross Domestic Product (GDP), [and
[energy substitution will **bend the curve**]{.mark} on oil
demand]{.underline}, as noted in the 2030's, and spell the twilight of
fossil fuels. Arjun points out that [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark}
simply **[[no ev]{.underline}]{.mark}**idence **[[this is
happening]{.underline}]{.mark}** using data compiled by Goldman Sachs
through 2019. [[Efficiency gains **never lower** the amount of energy
needed to produce]{.mark} an **[additional]{.mark}** dollar of
**[GDP]{.mark}**]{.underline}, above 2.7% GDP growth. A point rarely hit
in modern times. [[To close that gap]{.mark} and attain growth [you
**need**]{.mark}]{.underline} more energy inputs.
**[[Oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Looking at Arjun's graph below, which uses China as an example, we can
see with their present demand of 3.7 bbls per capita which equates to
about 15 mm BOPD. With 10 bbl per annum added on for growth in the
middle class, you get to 35 mm BOPD to meet Chinese energy demand. [Even
if China attains 100% Electric Vehicle-EV penetration, not something
Arjun]{.underline} (or I) [believe is possible, you still have **27 mm**
BOPD of oil demand]{.underline}. According to SP Global China produces
about 4.1 mm BOPD, leaving a gap of about 11 mm BOPD they must import to
meet present-day demand.

A point that leads me to what Arjun noted as the ultimate demand limiter
and why, although countries that will surely desire to increase their
oil usage may not be able to do so. Geopolitical limits to imports.
Quoting Arjun, "There is no precedent for countries importing 20-30 mm
BOPD" to meet their energy needs. The U.S., before the advent of shale
production was importing over 10 mm BOPD as recently as 2005. That's
what we know is possible.

It should be noted that India is in a similar fix and for it to meet
Arjun's 10 bbl per capita standard for being rich, they must import
35-45 mm BOPD. We just don't know if this can be done from both a
logistical and sheer capacity of supply basis. As the EIA graph above
highlights global oil production has increased only about 3 mm BOPD
since 2019. In order [for the world's poor to become richer, a great
deal more oil will have to come to market.]{.underline}

Your takeaway

The message of the growth of the middle class globally often gets lost
in the constant blare of climate change and energy transition noise.
[The fact remains that [the]{.mark} world we live in today and the one
[**likely to exist** at **mid-century**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[runs
on oil]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The notion]{.underline} that [the world can quickly and painlessly
transition to other forms of energy has developed]{.underline} some, not
holes, but **[gaping craters]{.underline}** in recent times. [[Offshore
wind farms are being **canceled**]{.mark} as **costs
mount**]{.underline}. [[Car manufacturers are
**delaying**]{.underline}]{.mark} implementation of [[**EV rollouts**
due to lack of interest]{.underline}]{.mark} from consumers.
[[Communities]{.underline}]{.mark} impacted by siting of solar farms
[[are pushing back on **land use**]{.underline}]{.mark} as they propose
to gobble up large tracts for this purpose.

Roger Pielke, another well-known energy commentator and author, in a
post in his Substack, The Honest Broker, cites a White Paper by Vaclav
Smil that discusses our energy transition progress to this point-

"[[**All** we have **managed**]{.mark} to do halfway through the
intended grand global energy transition [is a **small relative
decline**]{.mark} in the share of fossil fuel]{.underline} in the
world's primary energy consumption---from nearly 86 percent in 1997 to
about 82 percent in 2022. But [this marginal relative retreat has been
accompanied by a **massive absolute increase** in fossil fuel
combustion:]{.underline} in 2022 the world consumed nearly 55 percent
more energy locked in fossil carbon than it did in 1997."

Balanced against this lack of progress in substituting oil for other
forms of energy is the fact that the world's energy supply is in a tight
balance with demand at present. [If the poor of the world make even
modest progress toward Arjun's 10 bbl per annum prognostication in the
coming years, [the **Bull Case for oil** will]{.mark}
certainly]{.underline} \[[[assert]{.underline}]{.mark}\] asset
[[itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Oil demand is more likely to [plateau]{.underline} than [peak]{.underline}.

**Blas 23**, MA, Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy and

Isn't What It Sounds Like,\" Bloomberg,

Last week, [IEA Executive Director]{.underline} Fatih [Birol
announced]{.underline} that the next edition of the report, expected in
October, would show the world is on what he called "the cusp of a
historic turning point": [[Demand for]{.underline}]{.mark} coal,
**[[oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and natural [gas [is set to
**peak**]{.mark}]{.underline} before 2030.

Over the years, I have learned the hard way that when it comes to the
energy market, there's much truth in the cliché "it is difficult to make
predictions, especially about the future." If the prediction is about an
inflection point, then it's even more difficult.

The IEA should have learned the lesson, too. Historically, it
underestimated --- and by quite a lot --- the growth of wind and solar;
it all but missed the birth of the US oil shale revolution; and
prematurely called the end of coal's golden age in China by at least a
decade (and still counting).

Peak fossil-fuel consumption will be a cause for celebration. But
[**[I'm skeptical]{.mark}** it's]{.underline} as [near]{.underline} as
the IEA has said, especially for gas. Interestingly, Birol hedged his
words quite carefully: "Although fossil fuels are set to hit their peaks
this decade in structural terms, there can still be spikes, dips and
plateaus on the way down."

Here, "structural terms" does quite a lot of heavy lifting. And if there
can be spikes in demand after the peak, well, let's not call the first
high point a peak. Because it wouldn't be.

The debate about when the peak would be reached is intriguing --- but,
to me, it's a distraction. We wouldn't know for sure until several years
after demand has actually peaked. [[What really matters is the **shape
of the curve**]{.mark} in the years before and [after demand reaches its
**zenith**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The amateur mountaineer in me sees a
peak as the beginning of a frequently quite abrupt descent. One treks
higher, suffering and sweating, pauses a bit at the mount's summit and
then enjoys an easier downward climb. With most mountain ranges, going
up is as steep as coming down. That's what "peak" sounds like to many
others.

Not in the world of energy.

For oil, coal and gas, [[the fall may be **gentle** and
**slow**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After summiting, for a hiker, it's like
the other side of mountain turns into a high-altitude plateau rather
than your typically rapid Alpine descent. For many years, [[fossil-fuel
consumption may **hover** close to its **maximum
point**]{.underline}]{.mark}. How long? Maybe five or 10 years or even
as long as **[two decades]{.underline}**. That's incompatible with
what's needed for the world to achieve its net-zero emissions target by
2050. Equally, [[demand growth may **slow**]{.underline}]{.mark} to a
crawl for several years [[before reaching its]{.mark} ultimate
[peak]{.mark}]{.underline}, wrong-footing those bullish fossil-fuel
investors who bet on continued historical growth rates.

The history of fossil-fuel consumption suggest the years after the peak
wouldn't be the expectation of a quick descent.

[Take **coal**]{.underline}. [The IEA initially thought that
demand]{.underline} for the world's dirtiest fuel [had reached an apex
in **2013**]{.underline}. Since then, consumption has largely leveled
off and last year started climbing again, setting a fresh peak. [Under
current trends, demand is likely to set a **fresh all-time
high**]{.underline} in 2024 and 2025.

The gap between the most likely consumption path after reaching the
crest and the net-zero models is incredibly wide --- so broad that
discussing the exact date of the peak is redundant.

[Consider **oil**]{.underline}. [The IEA itself says]{.underline} global
[[oil demand needs to **drop**]{.mark} to 75 million
barrels]{.underline} a day by 2030 to be on track to achieve net zero.
[[It's **impossible** to see that happening]{.underline}]{.mark}. Why?
Because [demand is more than **103 million** barrels now]{.underline},
[and [**all** suggests **continued growth**]{.mark} over the next five
years]{.underline}, reaching 105 million to 106 million barrels a day by
2028 or 2029. Even if that marks the oil market's peak, the gulf between
reality and the model would exceed 30 million barrels a day --- equal to
the combined daily consumption of China, India, Japan, Germany, the UK,
France and Italy.

The day when the world's use of fossil fuels reaches its maximum is
nearer than ever. For oil and coal, perhaps it's as close as the IEA
says. For gas, it's further away. But the eye-catching bit is on the
summit's other side. And, I'm afraid, that [[anyone]{.mark} [thinking
about]{.mark} a **[rapid decline]{.mark}** after an extended ascension
[would be **disappointed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618307083#!)

As early as 2012, global financial services companies drew attention to
the risk of coal investments becoming stranded as a consequence of the
2°C "carbon budget."1 This carbon budget specifies the maximal amount of
cumulative carbon emissions that can be emitted without surpassing a 2°C
temperature increase above preindustrial levels (Meinshausen et al.,
2009; Allen et al., 2009). Therefore, [[climate policies might render
fossil-fuel assets **worthless**]{.mark} prior to the end of their
economic life time]{.underline}. We study whether the current market
valuation of companies owning fossil fuel assets reflects this risk of
stranding assets.2 A failure to price in this risk can lead to costly
consequences for the whole economy. First, the resulting misallocation
of capital due to delayed divestment could render the transition to
clean capital more expensive (IPCC, 2014; IRENA, 2017a). Second, [[a
**sudden** and **unexpected tightening** of]{.mark} carbon **[emission
policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Batten et al., 2016) or sudden changes
in expectations in the presence of tipping points (Krugman, 1991) [[can
lead to **abrupt repricing**]{.mark} of fossil fuel assets.
[This]{.mark}]{.underline} situation [[can result in a **negative supply
shock** through changes in **energy use** and **second-round**
effects]{.mark} in financial markets]{.underline}.3 Financial
institutions such as the Bank of England, the Dutch Central Bank (DNB),
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the European Systemic
Risk Board (ESRB) have identified the mispricing of stranded asset risk
as a potential systemic risk and threat to financial stability.4

Therefore, we analyze the interaction between investors' expectations
and the development of climate policies. Investors' reactions to new
policies depend on their prior expectations, which, in turn, are shaped
by previous policies. This interaction is central to the current paper:
What are investors' priors regarding stranded asset risk, and (how) do
these priors change when climate policy proposals are announced? In
particular, we analyze (i) whether investors have already priced in
expected losses due to the carbon budget, (ii) whether they only respond
to concrete policies, and (iii) whether they expect firms to be
financially compensated for stranded assets. To answer these questions,
we exploit the gradual development of a climate policy proposal in
Germany targeting lignite assets and investigate how adjustments of this
proposal have affected the market valuation of firms active in
electricity production. We find that investors did not react to
announcements of the initial "climate levy" proposal, which was directed
at stranding lignite assets by charging an extra fee on carbon emissions
(Stage 1). Investors also did not respond when the proposal transformed
into a compensation mechanism (Stage 2), paying plant owners for not
running their units. Only announcements that the compensation mechanism
may not go through due to violating state aid rules (Stage 3) resulted
in a significant and negative reaction. Our findings show that investors
do care about the stranded asset risk, but with an expectation of a
compensation mechanism.

Our analysis starts from the notion that the evolution of climate
policies and the expectations of investors are interrelated. First,
climate policies and policy proposals provide signals that shape how the
investors perceive the stranded asset risk. [[For instance]{.mark},
**setting [a price]{.mark}** [on **CO2 emissions**]{.mark}]{.underline}
or imposing a cost on fossil resource extraction5 can [[reduce
demand]{.mark}, **[slow]{.mark}** down **[investment]{.mark}** in fossil
infrastructure, [and cause **asset stranding**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Alternatively, policies addressing fossil-fuel reductions may compensate
fossil-fuel owners for leaving their reserves unburned. For example,
Harstad (2012) proposed that, in the absence of a global climate
agreement, "the coalition's best policy is to simply buy foreign
deposits and conserve them".6 Second, investors\' reactions to policy
signals depend on their prior expectations regarding the likelihood of
asset stranding and the credibility of climate policy announcements. For
example, they may have already devalued assets following information on
the carbon budget implied by the Paris Agreement, or they may find it
difficult to translate the concept of a carbon budget into stranded
asset risk.7 In the latter case, they would wait for further information
on climate policies with clear asset stranding implications. Even the
announcement of climate policies does not necessarily lead investors to
reassess the likeliness of asset stranding, if they expect a
compensation mechanism. The policy proposal we investigate provides the
opportunity to disentangle the effects of these policy signals and
expectations. By tracking the stock market response to different stages
of the proposal, we can draw conclusions about investors\' prior
expectations and how they evolved in the course of the policy\'s
development.3

[The effect that]{.underline} the **[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement
[will have on the fossil fuels markets is strongly dependent on how the

and [the **speed** and **ambition** of]{.mark} future [**emission
reductions** will have a **tremendous effect** on fossil fuels

The lack of preparedness can also be seen in international oil demand

**[[overshooting]{.underline}]{.mark}** the allowable [carbon budgets.

https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/wcc.722

As part of achieving these mitigation policies, emissions in developed
countries may be offset at lower costs by purchasing "carbon credits" in
developing countries. These [financial flows may compensate **some**
of]{.underline} the **[foregone]{.underline}** conventional economic
**[development]{.underline}** in developing countries which could have
supported stability, especially in transition economies (Gartzke, 2012).
[These [transfers]{.mark}, however]{.underline}, may or [[may **not**
have the **same pacifying effect**]{.underline}]{.mark} as other forms
of economic growth. First, these [[funds]{.underline}]{.mark} may have a
similar effect to fossil fuel revenues in that they [divert other
economic activity and [**amplify incentives** for **corruption**]{.mark}
and **patronage**]{.underline}. Second, [[they]{.mark} may
[provide]{.mark} receiving [governments with a means of **favoring**
certain groups]{.mark} over others]{.underline}, especially in
ethnically fragmented countries where political power and privileges are
shaped by ethnic affiliation. [[In contrast to **oil**]{.mark} that is
primarily purchased by **private firms** in the market, carbon permits
could be sold through rule-based organizations with binding
conditionality for the use of the rents]{.underline}. While the concerns
around financial flows from carbon markets remain speculative as these
markets have not developed, finance for mitigation and adaptation are
increasing. Limited empirical evidence has found that these funds have
promoted "green" economic growth with lower emissions (Carfora &
Scandurra, 2019). However, in the absence of mechanisms to ensure good
governance and equitable allocation of these funds, [there is the
potential that [they may **promote** conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Jakob et al., 2015). [[As existing structures]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
often **[discriminatory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [state-based allocation
may promote or, at a minimum, further entrench grievances]{.underline}.
Funneling funding directly to local groups has been proposed as a means
to address this challenge (Colenbrander et al., 2017).

can increase from two sources: one is OPEC rent transfers; the other is

Effects on fossil fuel exporters

Transition phase

[[A **rapid transition** would be **highly disruptive** to
**fossil**]{.underline}]{.mark} fuel
**[[producers]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- although the degree will depend
on their pre-existing economic diversity -- [and would probably be felt
first [through a **negative**]{.mark}]{.underline} terms of **[[trade
shock]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [rapid [price decline due to
**lower**]{.mark}]{.underline}-than-expected [**[oil demand]{.mark}**
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} obviously [[put **severe pressure**
on]{.mark} fossil fuel producers' [current
accounts]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus [creating balance of payments
and]{.underline}/or [exchange rate challenges]{.underline}. Similarly,
[a shock would pressure fiscal accounts [and **hinder governments**
in]{.mark} their **[attempts to respond]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These
issues were particularly apparent in Russia following the effects of
sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine.

Furthermore, [[worsening prospects for **fossil**]{.mark}
fuel**[s]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} place [pressure]{.mark} on
**[investment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus [[cutting off a **key growth
channel**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These issues may also be aggravated by
financial stresses; commodity [price crashes are]{.mark}]{.underline}
typically [[associated with]{.mark} rising [**non-performing loans** and
bank **funding costs**]{.mark}]{.underline} in commodity-producing
countries (Kinda et al (2016)).

[These effects can be observed in the experience of oil producers
following the 2014]{.underline} oil price [crash]{.underline}. Many
fossil fuel producers saw a collapse in their current account (Graph 7,
left-hand panel), which in turn depleted their foreign reserves and
sharply increased public debt levels (centre and right-hand panels). The
shock of the oil price crash significantly raised the risk premium in
affected countries and constrained policy responses as the shock hit as
well (Bouri et al (2020)).

### !\-\--Conventional War\-\--2NC

#### War causes extinction even it [never escalates]{.underline}.

University of Innsbruck, Austria. (Noah B., "Great Powers Conflict," in
*Existential Risks in Peace and Conflict Studies*, p. 68-69, Palgrave
Macmillan, ISSN 2752-857X)

The literature on Great Power Conflicts frames it as an indirect or a
compounding risk. Unlike a cataclysmic asteroid, it is difficult to
imagine how such a conflict would directly lead to human extinction. The
indirect pathways are easier to imagine. A Great Powers Conflict could
result in an intentional or unintended nuclear strike, likely resulting
in retaliation and nuclear war. In an even less direct manner, a [[Great
Power Conflict would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[result in a
**breakdown of trust**]{.mark} at the global level, [making
**coop**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[on]{.mark} **other**]{.underline}
possible **[[existential risks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[like
climate]{.mark} change **[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[War]{.mark},]{.underline} especially at this scale, significantly
[[directs **resources** and **attention**]{.underline}]{.mark} toward it
and [[away from other issues]{.mark}. This decrease in the overall
**global resilience**]{.underline} to deal with threats to existence
[could]{.underline} feasibly [happen at levels of extreme geopolitical
tension]{.underline} without necessarily requiring the outbreak of a
violent conflict. Thus, it is imaginable that the overall amount of
conflict, directly violent or not, between Great Powers increases the
potential for other threats to rise to the level of threatening our
existence.

How Bad Could It Be?

In the Founders Pledge report on Great Powers Conflicts, Clare (2021)
describes three possible existential risk scenarios that could result
from such conflicts. The first is a Great Power Conflict increasing
other potential existential risks. A foreseeable pathway to this
scenario is where **[heightened tensions]{.underline}** or outright
conflict between Great Powers [breakdown **international**]{.underline}
cooperation and **[coordination]{.underline}** that would have otherwise
mitigated that risk. **[An example]{.underline}** of this scenario
[would be]{.underline} **[tensions]{.underline}** or conflicts between
Great Powers Conflict **[inhibiting coop]{.underline}**eration [from
addressing]{.underline} extreme **[climate change]{.underline}**, [which
becomes]{.underline} an **[existential]{.underline}** threat (the
likelihood of climate change resulting in an existential risk will be
addressed in Chap. 5). Similarly, [the state of
[insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline} created by this breakdown of trust
[[could **direct**]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[**investment** into
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[research]{.underline}]{.mark} that
could be used for military purposes, [[increasing the
likelihood]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}n
unexpected "**[[black ball]{.underline}]{.mark}** technology" [[is
created]{.underline}]{.mark}. These technologies are those that, once
invented, destroy their creators. Possible
[[examples]{.underline}]{.mark} of this kind of emerging technologies
[[would be]{.mark} massively **[more powerful]{.mark}**

[[or **unaligned a**]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial

technologies resulting in an existential risk will be discussed in Chap.
6) (Clare 2021).

The risks of great power war. [[War among great powers **increases
existential risk**]{.underline}]{.mark} in at least four ways. First,
[[the global **cooperative system**]{.underline}]{.mark} [necessary to
combat existential threats [may be]{.mark}]{.underline} seriously
damaged or **[[destroyed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Second, [combatants
might target]{.underline} and destroy **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
and capacity [necessary to implement existential risk mitigation

[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nologies [like a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence [[that create **new existential
risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fourth, a great power war following
nuclear abolition could touch off rapid, unstable nuclear rearmament and
proliferation.

After World War II, the United Nations, NATO, the International Monetary
Fund, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and numerous other
**[[international organizations]{.underline}]{.mark}** were built to
stabilize the world and prevent such a global catastrophe from happening
again. That cooperative framework [[allowed]{.underline}]{.mark} for
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} United Nations

through the G-7, [and facilitated]{.underline} high-level [discussions
on]{.underline} the risks of **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence. However, [a massive global war would
undermine the]{.underline} very [foundations of this order]{.underline},
because it would show the economic, political, and institutional ties
between nations were never enough to prevent global conflict. Plus,
[[World War III might]{.mark} [result in the]{.mark}]{.underline}
crippling or [[destruction of the]{.mark} powerful states and
**[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that hold up global governance:
China, France, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the

### !\-\--AT: Emboldenment\-\--2NC

#### Emboldenment is [backwards]{.underline}. Low prices cause resource grabs, shows of strength, and diversionary war\-\--high prices strengthen deterrence. 

**Blankenship 24**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the
University of Miami. (Brian, Qaraman Hasan, Soran Mohtadi, Indra
Overland, and Johannes Urpelainen, 5-17-2024, "Oil Prices and
International Conflict: Why Low Oil Revenue May Not Pacify Petrostates,"
International Interactions, 50:3, p. 482-485, DOI:
10.1080/03050629.2024.2352486)

But while the prevalence of "oil wars" is contested, [an emerging
consensus suggests]{.underline} that regardless of whether countries
fight over oil, [[petroleum revenues]{.underline}]{.mark} nevertheless
**[[embolden petrostates]{.underline}]{.mark}** to fight more broadly.
The basic logic of the "Emboldenment" argument is that oil revenue
allows petrostates to behave more aggressively by giving them more
freedom to invest in waging war (**[[Ashford]{.underline}]{.mark}**
2022). **[[Colgan]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2010), for example, argues
that revolutionary leaders with revisionist ambitions are more likely to
initiate conflict when they have access to plentiful oil revenues, such
as Saddam Hussein's Iraq or Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran.

Notably, the Emboldenment mechanism as most notably developed by Colgan
was intended to explain differences in the conflict initiation behavior
of petrostates and non-petrostates---not to explore how variation in oil
revenue over time shapes variation in petrostate behavior. Nevertheless,
if one extends the logic of the Emboldenment mechanism to oil prices,
one might expect petrostates to be more likely to initiate conflict when
oil prices are higher. For countries that depend on oil as a source of
government revenue, changes in demand for and the price of oil have
dramatic implications for their ability to provide public goods,
distribute patronage, and invest in military and economic instruments of
foreign policy. Thus, more plentiful revenue can allow petrostates to
indulge their foreign policy ambitions. By contrast, revenue shortfalls
should constrain petrostate foreign policy, generating incentives for
petrostate to bide their time and live to fight another day by
conserving resources (MacDonald and Parent 2018). The Emboldenment
school, then, might expect higher oil prices to be associated with more
petro-aggression.

Why Low Oil Prices May Not Pacify Petrostates

Yet even if their oil wealth enables petrostates with revisionist
ambitions to initiate more conflict, on average, than non-petrostates,
[it does **not**]{.underline} necessarily **[follow]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} the effect of temporal fluctuations in that oil
wealth will be in the same direction---that is, that **[higher oil
prices]{.underline}** will necessarily [mean **more** petrostate
**conflict** initiation]{.underline}. [**Constrained resources** due to
declines to]{.underline} their [oil wealth]{.underline} may [lead
petrostates to **go on the offensive** in a desperate effort to **stave
off decline**]{.underline}, [discourage other countries from **preying
on**]{.underline} their **[weakness]{.underline}**, [and **distract**
domestic audiences]{.underline}. This is in effect the inverse of the
Emboldenment mechanism, which expects that oil revenue empowers
petrostates to initiate conflict because they can. Instead, drops in
their oil revenue may compel petrostates to initiate conflict because
they feel they must.

Skeptics of the Emboldenment school argue that [petrostates have **good
reason** to be **cautious** about attacking their
neighbors]{.underline}. Even if they win, [war and]{.underline} any
subsequent [occupation]{.underline} of conquered [territory is
**costly**]{.underline}, and may be especially so for petrostates.
[Vital oil [infrastructure may be damaged due to
fighting]{.mark}]{.underline} in contested territory or direct attacks
from adversary forces, and any foreign investment that could help
rebuild this infrastructure may dry up. Moreover, because
[[petrostates]{.underline}]{.mark} typically depend on their oil
exports, they [[are]{.mark} highly [vulnerable to]{.mark} international
**[sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline} imposed as a result of their
aggression (Meierding 2020; Jang and Smith 2021). Indeed, if the war
goes badly, petrostates risk having their own oil resources conquered by
their adversary, which may be even more inclined to seize them when
prices are high (Caselli, Morelli, and Rohner 2015).

[[When oil prices **decline**]{.mark}, **however**,
[petrostates]{.mark}]{.underline} may feel compelled to [[**throw
caution** to the **wind**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Low oil prices could
increase conflict through at least three different mechanisms: battling
over a smaller market, diversionary conflict, and signaling strength.
First, as Pischedda (2020) suggests, [actors facing a]{.underline}n
acute [**window of vulnerability** may]{.underline} be tempted to
**[seize]{.underline}** the **[resources]{.underline}** of another
[actor to stave off decline.]{.underline}5 This is the Battling over a
Smaller Market mechanism, and is similar to the dynamics of what
Meierding (2020) calls "oil gambits": oil conflicts fought out of
desperation. Markowitz and others argue that this sort of conquest is
particularly likely among countries that depend on rents extracted from
land, and when the resources in question are more easily lootable
(Markowitz 2020; Markowitz et al. 2020; Coe and Markowitz 2021). Altman
(2017, 2020) similarly shows that conquest attempts since 1945 tend to
be characterized by sudden land seizures (faits accomplis) rather than
through threats.

The Battling over a Smaller Market mechanism would expect greater
petrostate conflict initiation when oil prices are lower, and would in
particular predict aggression toward other petrostates and oil-rich
territory. The logic here is that [[when faced with a **negative
shock**]{.mark} to their oil revenues, [petrostates]{.mark}
may]{.underline} try to [**reverse** their fortunes. Petrostates
[might]{.mark}]{.underline} expect that
**[[seiz]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing additional [**oil
[resources]{.mark}** will help them weather]{.underline} the impact of
[low]{.underline} oil [prices]{.underline} for two reasons. The first is
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[**increasing**
the]{.underline}]{.mark} total [[amount of]{.underline}]{.mark} oil
[[revenue they bring in]{.underline}]{.mark} each year (Meierding 2022).
The second is by giving the petrostate a greater share of global
production, and thus allowing them more influence on the oil market and
greater ability to shape prices unilaterally (Bordoff 2020). During the
low oil price era of the 1990s and early 2000s, for example, Iran, Iraq,
Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela all initiated disputes over
oil-rich territory.6

Second, [[petrostates]{.mark} might]{.underline} also elect to
**[[initiate]{.underline}]{.mark}** more [[**conflict** when]{.mark} oil
[prices are low to **distract domestic audiences**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is the Diversionary Conflict mechanism. Because reduced oil revenue
constrains petrostates' ability to distribute public goods and patronage
at home, [low oil prices can lead to anti-government
**opposition**]{.underline} and unrest. [To **sideline**]{.underline}
and ultimately reduce [public **dissatisfaction**, the government
might]{.underline} try to [generate a]{.underline}
"**[rally-around-the-flag]{.underline}**" [effect by
**[diverting]{.mark}** popular [ire toward a **foreign enemy** and
**stoking nationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lee 1977; Oakes 2012).
Like the Battling over a Smaller Market mechanism, the Diversionary
Conflict mechanism is based on a "gambling for resurrection" logic in
which petrostates might be willing to run great risks in the hopes of
staving off a negative outcome (Downs and Rocke 1994). But what matters
here is not so much the military or policy objectives of the war, like
in the Battling over a Smaller Market mechanism, but rather the
existence of the conflict itself, and the effects that a sense of common
struggle and victory over a common enemy has on policymakers' domestic
political fortunes (Meierding 2022). Some observers, for example,
speculate that [[**Russia's** decision to escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}
its involvement [[in **Syria** was]{.underline}]{.mark} at least partly
[[to **divert attention**]{.mark} from the country's economic woes
amidst **low oil prices**]{.underline} during the mid- and late-2010s
(Åslund 2016; Petkova 2020).

Finally, [**negative shocks** to]{.underline} their [oil revenue may
lead petrostates to **initiate**]{.underline} more [**conflict** to
**show strength**]{.underline}, via the Signaling Strength mechanism. [A
**large**]{.underline} body of **[lit]{.underline}**erature [points to
the emphasis]{.underline} that [states place on]{.underline} cultivating
**[reputations for strength]{.underline}** and resolve, as doing so can
allow them to more effectively use threats of force to deter and coerce
other countries (Schelling 1966). Scholars debate the degree to which
reputation "matters" in terms of whether adversaries believe that a
country's past behavior is a reliable predictor of its future behavior
(Mercer 1996; Press 2005; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015; Lupton 2020).
However, even reputation skeptics concede that [states often believe
their reputation matters]{.underline}, [and act to build]{.underline}
and preserve [their reputation for **toughness**]{.underline} (Tang
2005; Yarhi-Milo 2018). Clare and Danilovic (2010) find that states are
more likely to initiate conflict when other states have reason to doubt
its willingness to fight.

By a similar logic, one might expect declines in oil wealth to lead
petrostates to initiate conflict. [Because [reduced]{.mark} oil [revenue
**constrains** petrostates']{.mark} ability to invest in [**military
power**, they might **fear**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[other
states]{.mark} will]{.underline} be tempted to [[**prey** on their
weakness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, [[petrostates]{.mark} may
[**initiate conflict** to **offset**]{.mark}]{.underline} this perceived
[**[weakness]{.mark}** and signal their **willingness to
fight**]{.underline}. This does not necessarily imply that petrostates
will launch prolonged, costly wars or engage in a campaign of serial
aggression. Rather, they may pick targeted fights without necessarily
crossing the threshold into actual war.

[[When]{.mark} oil [prices are high]{.mark}, **by contrast**,
[petrostates may be]{.mark} sufficiently [**self-confident** to
**refrain** from picking fights]{.mark}]{.underline} to signal strength.
Indeed, [targets may be more likely to **concede** to a petrostate's
demands]{.underline} without having to fight when oil prices are high
[because they know that it has **more resources** to draw
upon]{.underline} during wartime and is thus likely to be a tougher
opponent. In other words, targets may effectively self-select out of
conflict with petrostates when oil prices are high (Fearon 1994, 1995).

Quantitative Results

The presentation of the results proceeds as follows. First, we present
the main results showing the overall effect of oil prices on petrostate
conflict initiation. Second, we subject the results to several
additional checks to probe the robustness of the findings. Finally, we
probe the causal mechanisms by exploring the conditions under which the
link between oil prices and petrostate conflict initiation is stronger
or weaker.

Table 1 presents the main results using incidence rate ratios, where
values less than 1 indicate a negative effect and those above 1 a
positive effect. Across different lag specifications, [[oil prices have
a]{.underline}]{.mark} statistically
**[[significant]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[**negative association**
with]{.mark} petrostate [conflict initiation]{.mark} for
MIDs]{.underline} at hostility levels of both 2 or higher and 4 or
higher. For example, Model 1's coefficient (0.987) indicates that
[[the]{.mark} predicted [number]{.mark} of MIDs [declines]{.mark} by
[**1.3%** for each **dollar increase**]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [oil
price]{.underline}. For ease of interpretation, Figure 1 presents the
predicted number of MIDs initiated per petrostate per year across
different levels of oil prices.12 Oil prices in around the median value
of \$40 per barrel are associated with .017 \[95% CI: .013−.021\] MIDs
initiated per petrostate per year, while those one standard deviation
below (\$10/barrel) are associated with .025 \[.016−.034\] compared to
.012 \[.007−.016\] at \$70 and .008 \[.003−.013\] at \$100. Moreover, as
Table A6 shows, the effect of oil prices does not hold for conflicts in
which the petrostate was on the receiving side of the conflict. This
placebo test offers greater confidence in the main results, as they
suggest that oil prices have a distinctive effect on petrostates'
behavior that does not hold for non-petrostates. Table A7, in turn,
suggests [that the relationship is **stronger** among petrostates that
produce **more oil**]{.underline}, whose revenues one would expect to be
more affected by changes in oil prices.13

Notably, [our results differ from]{.underline} those of
**[Hendrix]{.underline}** (2017, 584), who finds that lower oil prices
are not associated with greater petrostate conflict initiation. Several
differences between the two analyses can likely explain this. The first
is that [[our data extend to **2014**, rather than]{.mark}
**[2001]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The second is that [Hendrix uses a
time-varying measure of petrostate status]{.underline}, such that
countries drop in and out of that classification from year-to-year.
However, as we discussed previously, [using a time-varying measure risks
making inclusion into the sample **endogenous** to oil prices, as oil
income rises when the price increases]{.underline}. Indeed, when we
limit our sample to the pre-2002 period or use a time-varying measure of
petrostate status, our results, like those presented in Hendrix's Table
2, are weaker and in some cases not statistically distinguishable from
zero (see Table A12).

[The [results are **robust** to **different model
specifications**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as shown in the online appendix.
[[These include]{.underline}]{.mark} including [[**more control**
variables]{.underline}]{.mark} (Table A2); [using net export revenues of
at least 10% GDP]{.underline} or oil rents at 20% of GDP [as the
[sampling thresholds]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tables A3--A4); [including
country-decade fixed effects to account for]{.underline}
country-specific [time heterogeneity]{.underline} (Table A5); clustering
standard errors by year (Table A11); [[and]{.underline}]{.mark},
following Jang and Smith (2021), [controlling]{.underline} for [[an
Iran-Iraq]{.mark} War [dummy variable]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tables
A17-A18).

As a supplementary test to explore the effects of cross-national
variation in how constrained or abundant each petrostate's oil revenue
is, in Table A19, we replace oil prices with each country's
reserve-to-production (R/P) ratio, which measures the number of years'
worth of oil reserves the country has. Like oil prices, the R/P ratio
allows us to capture the degree to which a petrostate faces structural
constraints on its oil revenue. The results show that [countries with a
higher R/P ratio initiate fewer MIDs, **on average**, than those with a
lower R/P ratio]{.underline}. This is consistent with the main findings,
as it suggests that [petrostates facing constraints on their oil revenue
are **more likely** to initiate conflict]{.underline}.

Taken together, [[these]{.mark} results [offer **greater support**
for]{.mark} the Battling over a Smaller Market, Diversionary Conflict,
and **[Signaling Strength]{.mark}**]{.underline} explanations
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
**[[Emboldenment]{.underline}]{.mark}** mechanism. Across model
specifications, oil prices reduce the number of MIDs that petrostates
initiate. Moreover, Figure 2 shows how the predicted number of
petrostate-initiated MIDs across oil prices varies with or without the
presence of a revolutionary government. As the results show, high oil
prices do not increase petrostate conflict initiation even in the
presence of a revolutionary government---though, consistent with Colgan
(2013), revolutionary governments are associated with more conflict
initiation overall.

Conclusion: Implications for the Energy Transition

This article set out to understand the degree to which the foreign
policies of major oil-producers---and in particular their propensity to
initiate conflict---are shaped by variation in oil prices. The [findings
are more consistent with petrostates **initiating
conflict**]{.underline} more when [oil prices are **low**]{.underline},
[than with petrostates being **emboldened**]{.underline} by oil prices
and going on the offensive due to being flush with oil revenue. The key
implication of the findings, then, is that [[declining oil prices are
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[**good news**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[petro-aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Previous periods of low oil prices have not been periods of petrostate
passivity; if anything, [petrostates have initiated more conflict
when]{.underline} oil [prices decline]{.underline}.

Our findings speak to the broader literature on "petro-aggression." As
described in the introduction, scholars disagree as to whether
petrostates are more aggressively overall, and are if anything even more
divided over whether petrostates fight each other over oil. While our
findings do not focus on petrostates' overall levels of aggression, they
suggest that petrostates are, in general, more likely to be aggressive
when oil prices are lower. Moreover, the findings may help to begin
bridging the gap between proponents and skeptics of what Meierding
(2016) calls the "oil wars hypothesis." Scholars like Meierding (2016,
2020), Jang and Smith (2021), and Ashford (2022) point out that
[[would-be conquerors face]{.mark} serious i[mpediments to]{.mark}
seeking to [seize]{.mark} and profit from [the]{.mark} oil [resources of
their neighbors]{.mark},]{.underline} including the costs of occupation
and the risk of international reprisals. Our findings suggest that while
these arguments may very well be correct, [[these constraints might be
**less likely**]{.mark} to **discourage** such attempts
[during]{.mark}]{.underline} periods of **[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}**
oil **[[prices]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A natural question arises as to the degree to which these findings are
applicable to the energy transition that is likely to put downward
pressure on oil revenue in the coming years (see e.g. Van de Graaf 2018;
Bordoff 2020). The key ways in which declining revenue during the energy
transition is likely to differ from previous oil busts are twofold. The
first is that the energy transition's effects on oil revenue may not
necessarily be through the mechanism of prices if supply declines at a
similar rate as demand. Instead, it is more likely to be through the
volume of oil sold. Second, price fluctuations are difficult to predict
but temporary; petrostates could reasonably expect revenue to rebound,
as global demand for oil continued to climb. By contrast, slowing and
ultimately declining demand for oil is likely to be a gradual, long-term
process which petrostates can anticipate with some degree of certainty.
Our findings thus cannot necessarily be interpreted as predictions about
petrostates behavior during the energy transition, as petrostates may be
able to proactively adapt by, for example, diversifying their economies.

However, [this proactive adaptation could also include **conflict
initiation**]{.underline} based on mechanisms similar to those described
in this paper. But whereas we find that petrostates initiate conflict
after oil prices decline, [having [knowledge of]{.mark} their
[**impending decline** may lead petrostates to initiate]{.mark} in the
**[early]{.mark}** days of the transition. [States facing]{.mark} the
prospect of]{.underline} a [**[permanent decline]{.mark}** may [face
a]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[use it or lose it]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
**[[incentive]{.underline}]{.mark}**---to try [to take advantage of [a
**closing window**]{.mark} of opportunity [to take advantage of their
position before it's too late]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether [[by
engaging in]{.mark} **coercion** or **[preventive war]{.mark}** against
rivals or]{.underline} trying to engage in [**conquest** to]{.underline}
try and **[stave off]{.underline}** their **[decline]{.underline}**
(Gilpin 1981; Van Evera 1999; Copeland 2000). Thus, [petrostates may
face the **worst** of both worlds]{.underline}---**[declining
revenue]{.underline}**, [and knowledge]{.underline} that [they
may]{.underline} [have **little to lose** since the future]{.underline}
may be even more disadvantageous. Somewhat counterintuitively, then,
[the [incentives for "**oil grabs**" may]{.mark} be **[highest]{.mark}**
during the **[earlier]{.mark}**]{.underline}, rather than later,
[**phase** of the energy transition.]{.underline}

Pax Petrolica: Theorizing an Oil Peace

Where a resource curse consensus in the domestic arena once existed, a
dissenting scholarly community has emerged. This group of heterodox
scholars has produced [[research]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} either conditionally or wholly [[**positive
effects** for **oil wealth** on]{.underline}]{.mark} development,12
state capacity,13 and democracy.14 As we theorize in this section and
demonstrate empirically in the next, there are good theoretical reasons
to believe it may also have conditionally or direct salutary
international effects. Our theory of an oil
**[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** rests on three foundations: the
commercial peace thesis, the costs of war for oil producers, and the
dampening impact of oil wealth on the incentives for diversionary
foreign conflicts.15

International Costs of War

We start by observing that [[countries dependent on]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [revenues]{.underline} derived [from]{.underline} their
[[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} and gas sectors [[rely
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the willingness of [[importing countries to
buy]{.mark} their [fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}, and usually on
foreign investors for the ability to deliver it to buyers. First, and
put simply, oil is commercial trade, a global network, the purchasing
and selling of a commodity that happens to be disproportionately
important to the world economy. [Because]{.underline} it is so important
to exporting countries' revenues, and [[because losing those revenues
would be]{.underline}]{.mark} so
**[[catastrophic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we suggest that [[it is likely
to encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} more
**[[pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[not]{.underline}** more
**[belligerent]{.underline}**, international
[[behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}. Subsequently, the oil peace falls into
the broader framework of the commercial.16 [Due to the peace-promoting
impact of]{.underline} both [trade dependence and]{.underline} of the
[diffusion of]{.underline} peaceful [conflict resolutions
through]{.underline} interstate [trade networks, greater economic
integration can lead states to **set aside**]{.underline} their
proclivities to choose **[war]{.underline}** over statecraft. [The
benefits of peace are a **powerful**]{.underline} positive
[**incentive** for pacific behavior on]{.underline} the part of
[oil-producing states]{.underline}. We suggest that [[commercial]{.mark}
peace [incentives are **more likely** to]{.mark}]{.underline} hold
**[[sway]{.underline}]{.mark}** over [**[oil-exporting
countries]{.mark}** than **other**]{.underline} commodity
[exporter**s**]{.underline}. As Erik Gartzke and Oliver Westerwinter
suggest, "for trade to act as a barrier to conflict, the commercial
losses anticipated from fighting must be large relative to the overall
cost of fighting." 17 Many of the world's [[oil exporters are not
just]{.mark} oil [trade dependent, but **overwhelmingly**
so]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Emily Meierding outlines two additional barriers to oil wars, which are
applicable to oil-producing states: (1) international and (2) investment
obstacles.18 First, [oil-producing countries have **good reason** to
**fear**]{.underline} international **[sanctions]{.underline}** and
other penalties for system-damaging actions. [**International
punishment** is a disincentive to]{.underline} initiate
[conflicts]{.underline}. The devastation to Iraq's economy between 1991
and 2003, resulting from post--Gulf War sanctions, and the current
economic crisis in Iran due to sanctions provide two solid examples.
[[Belligerent countries]{.mark} face the prospect of both
**[hav]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [[their ability to **export**]{.mark}
**oil [curtailed]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} of
**[los]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [[**access** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the US **[[dollar-driven]{.underline}]{.mark}** commodity **[[financial
system]{.underline}]{.mark}** with[in]{.underline} [which oil is
traded]{.underline}.

Second, [even if oil-rich countries were dedicated to conquering their
neighbors, [the chances they could]{.mark} then **[attract foreign
firms]{.mark}** to **continue investing**]{.underline} in their oil
sectors, or in rebuilding and then maintaining export capacity in the
conquered territory if it were also oil rich, [[are
**slim**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Investors]{.mark}, in addition
to]{.underline} usually [being sensitive to]{.underline} the [policy
interests]{.underline} of their home countries, [[are **skittish** when
it comes to]{.underline}]{.mark} the perceived costs of [[war]{.mark}
due to **uncertainty**]{.underline}. [[Investing
**millions**]{.underline}]{.mark} or billions of dollars [[in **immobile
assets**]{.mark} such as those required to extract petroleum [is]{.mark}
highly **[questionable]{.mark}** when war is a]{.underline} genuine
[threat]{.underline}.

Moreover, [oil states considering]{.underline} starting
[war]{.underline}s [risk harming their own]{.underline} long-term
[market position]{.underline}. Iran, for example, can currently produce
only about 500,000 barrels per day because of international sanctions,
roughly one-sixth of its maximum presanction production capacity. [With
Iran's oil basically gone]{.underline}, global [consumers simply find
supply from another of the fifty]{.underline} or so significant
producers [remaining]{.underline}. Collective action problems make it
simply too difficult to achieve complete coordination, nearly all the
time, for the oil-supply weapon to be of much utility for individual
states. In short, we find strong reason to expect that, at the
international-system level, constraints on bellicosity should lead
rulers in oil-producing countries to be less inclined toward initiating
conflicts.

Domestic Substitution: Side Payments and Not Scapegoats

At the domestic level, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} equally
[[**compelling reasons** to expect an **oil
peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}. These reasons stem from the logic of the
domestic diversion or "scapegoat" framework for understanding the
international determinants of conflict initiation. That logic suggests
that, [[facing]{.mark} popular [dissent]{.mark} or disapproval at home,
[leaders]{.mark} might [engage in **military action
abroad**]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially territorial conflicts) as a
means of trying [[to **catalyze** a **rally-around-the-flag
effect**]{.mark} to bolster their **domestic positions**.]{.underline}19
This line of scholarship often suggests that [diversionary]{.underline}
military [adventurism seeks to **distract** from **economic
underperformance**]{.underline}. Conversely, we might expect that
**[high]{.underline}**er [**levels of oil income** might enable leaders
to **circumvent**]{.underline} political [**dissent** by using oil
revenues for social policy increases]{.underline} or other kinds of side
payments. These reasons also reinforce the international system-level
peace effect, leading us, overall, to expect oil producers to be less
bellicose than nonoil producers.

[[Where **other**]{.mark} leader**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} might
[[initiate conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad [[to
**distract**]{.mark} **opposition**]{.underline} at home [[from
**economic**]{.underline}]{.mark} or political
**[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** (diversionary conflict initiation),
[rulers in [oil-rich states]{.mark} could [**buy domestic peace** by
allocating **resource rents** to **public goods**]{.mark}
**provision**]{.underline} or widely distributed club goods. Cristina
Bodea, Masaaki Higashijima, and Raju Jan Singh find that [this dynamic
exists in the context of **blunting** the likelihood of **civil
conflict**]{.underline}---**[[public spending
minimizes]{.underline}]{.mark}** the risk of civil
**[[wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**.20 Applying that logic of oil cushioning
spending, we postulate it to be related to more peaceful international
behavior as well. As such, we expect that:

> Hypothesis 1a (H1a). If a country is a petrostate (oil exports are
> greater than 10% of total exports or greater than 10% of gross
> domestic product (GDP)), then it is less likely to initiate MIDs.
>
> Hypothesis 1b (H1b). The more oil/gas income a country receives each
> year, the less likely it is to initiate MIDs.21

Discussion and Conclusion

Based on this elaborated analysis, it is possible to advance some
preliminary conclusions. First, [to the extent]{.underline} that [oil
wealth has a]{.underline} consistent [effect]{.underline}, [the evidence
suggests it is]{.underline} generally [a **peaceful** one]{.underline}.
All else equal, [[oil-producing countries tend to be **less
aggressive**]{.underline}]{.mark} toward their neighbors than non-oil
producers once we account for the statistical outlier that is the
Iran--Iraq War. [[This]{.mark} relationship [holds across **multiple
measurement**]{.mark}]{.underline} choice**[[s and
model]{.underline}]{.mark}** specification**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Even revolutionary]{.mark} oil-producing [countries are no more
bellicose]{.mark}]{.underline} than revolutionary non-oil-producing
countries. When we account for the Iran--Iraq War, oil prices also,
whether alone or interacted with oil wealth and radical leadership, have
at best an inconsistent impact on the risk of interstate conflict.

In short, [[the relationships we find]{.mark} here
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} the possibility of [[an **oil
peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}. What remains open to investigation are the
mechanisms that might link oil wealth to more peaceful international
behavior. Are they primarily domestic or systemic? And which
implications of oil wealth at each level appear to be steering
substantial oil producers toward more pacific international roles? To
the extent that oil-producing countries are more peaceful than non-oil
producers, it may well suggest a need to "normalize" oil producers as
ones whose behavior is explained by the commercial peace thesis like
that of producers of other commodities.43 These questions of causal
process are an obvious next step for scholarship seeking to reconcile
the inconsistency of the oil--interstate war thesis with the suggestive
evidence for an oil peace.

Methodologically, our findings here suggest several things. First, [[it
is]{.mark} past [time to bring **measurement**]{.mark} choices [in the
**oil**]{.mark}-interstate [**war** research agenda **up to date**. The
data we analyze]{.mark} here for oil and gas income per capita, which is
publicly archived, [employs the **best available measure** of oil
abundance and]{.mark}]{.underline} its original form [[extends from
**1932** to **2014**]{.underline}]{.mark}.44 For scholars seeking to
complement that with a ratio measure of dependence, best practices in
the resource curse research program most often now use oil/gas income as
a share of GDP rather than only export revenues. Moreover, we lack any
good empirical or theoretical reasons to establish categorical
boundaries between what is a "petrostate" and what is not, and unless
and until we do, it makes more sense to use continuous data. Second,
unless there are solid reasons to dismiss system-level causal factors in
our statistical models (and there are certainly not at present---on the
contrary, nearly all current studies of war onset find multiple
important determinants at this level of analysis), scholars should
employ random-effects estimators.

Oil and Democratic Stability: Is There a Resource Blessing?

We have presented findings suggesting that [oil does not stabilize
autocratic polities, [once we account for]{.mark}]{.underline}
endogenous [[**selection bias** among]{.mark} the]{.underline} five
small [principalities of [the **Arabian
Peninsula**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In light of this finding, it would be
a propitious moment to reconsider the possibility that [[oil has a
**stabilizing effect**]{.mark} on democracies: [is there a **resource
blessing**]{.mark}]{.underline} taking the specific form of [reducing
the likelihood of a **democratic breakdown**]{.underline}?

Recall that much of the early work on the political resource curse
pooled democracies and dictatorships and modeled whether oil wealth was
associated with lower levels of democracy, measured by Polity scores.
Over time, the critical question shifted to whether oil made autocracies
more durable, a question that was largely studied by creating a data set
containing only autocratic regime spells. To the best of our knowledge,
no scholarship has asked the complementary question of whether oil makes
democracies more durable by looking exclusively at the subset of
democratic regime spells. The possibility of an oil blessing, narrowly
construed as lowering the risk of democratic breakdown, thus deserves
further consideration. Indeed, Benjamin Smith (2017) finds that oil
wealth has a stabilizing effect when pooling democracies, hybrid
regimes, and dictatorships; if oil does not stabilize dictatorships,
then it is a reasonable speculation that oil might be stabilizing
democracies.

[[We work with a **global sample** of **democratic spells**]{.mark} for
**all countries**]{.underline} with populations over 500,000,
[covering]{.underline} the years **[1960--2009.]{.underline}** The data
set includes all regime spells during which Polity IV scores are 6 or
higher: we use 6 as the threshold to ensure that we include countries
that are not fully consolidated democracies, the exclusion of which
would bias our results. A regime spell ends when the Polity IV score
drops below 6.

The statistical models are drawn from previous work (Smith n.d.). As in
the earlier analyses in this section, we report the findings of survival
models using two different measures of oil wealth: oil and gas income
per capita (Ross and Mahdavi 2015) and rent leverage (Smith 2017). The
results are listed in Table 1; Figure 10 depicts the findings
graphically. Note that coefficients less than 1 imply a reduced risk of
breakdown, while coefficients above 1 imply a heighted \[\[TABLE
OMITTED\]\] risk of failure. The coefficients on rent leverage and on
oil and gas income reported in Table 1 have the following substantive
interpretation: with all control variables set at their mean values,
[a]{.underline} unit **[increase]{.underline}** (about 10 percent) [in
**[oil]{.mark}**]{.underline} and gas [[income is associated with
a]{.underline}]{.mark} roughly [**4 percent [decrease]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the likelihood of a **[democratic
failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A unit increase **in rent
leverage**]{.underline} (5 percent) [is associated with a larger
reduction in that risk -- about **14 percent**]{.underline}.

Preliminary mediation analysis suggests two causal pathways linking oil
wealth to heightened democratic stability (Smith 2017). First, [[oil
wealth may be]{.underline}]{.mark}, as others have begun to suggest,
[[associated with greater]{.underline}]{.mark} state **[[institutional
capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Ross 2012; Smith 2012, 2017; Menaldo
2016). [Greater state capacity may in turn increase democratic stability
by **[catalyzing higher]{.mark}**]{.underline} rates of
**[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [forestalling]{.underline} economic
**[downturns]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} doing a better
job of [**[shielding]{.mark}** citizens [from]{.mark} the effects of
**[downturns]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Elfs, Andersen, and Krishnarajan
2019). Second, [oil [wealth may]{.mark} be **[financ]{.mark}**ing
**enhanced patronage** and **social [welfare]{.mark}
programs**]{.underline} that can substitute for coercion (Bodea,
Higashijima, and Singh 2016).

There may be a direct effect as well. As we have seen, while research
has shown that rising income has an endogenous effect on democratic
transitions only for the earliest democratic transitions in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, [rising income has a
**consistently strong**]{.underline} exogenous [**effect** on
**democratic consolidation**]{.underline} across all time periods
(Przeworski and Limongi 1997; Boix and Stokes 2003; Fish and Wittenberg
2009). That is to say, while \[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\] rising income does
not directly catalyze democratic transitions, countries that make the
transition to democracy for reasons independent of income are less
likely to experience a democratic breakdown at higher levels of income.

The finding that oil wealth may stabilize democracies should seem
surprising given the prominent coverage of Russia (Fish 2005) and
Venezuela (Mazzuca 2013) as two cases of democratic erosion in
petro-states. But our theoretical expectations might shift if we
broadened our view to include [[**Indonesia** and]{.underline}
**[Mexico]{.underline}**]{.mark}, two countries [in which]{.underline}
long-standing [[**dictatorships** were **swept away**]{.mark} by
democratic transitions [that **coincided**]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
[[**perfectly** with the]{.underline}]{.mark} onset of the [early
twenty-first-century **[oil boom]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indonesia, the
world's largest Muslim-majority state, spent thirty-two years under
single-party rule; Mexico was one of the world's longest-lived
single-party autocracies. It is safe to say that the deck was stacked
against both of these democratic transitions deepening and becoming
durable. Yet [the return of oil as a key sector in each political
economy has taken place alongside what appears to be consolidated if
imperfect democracy]{.underline}. It is at least plausible that oil
might have influenced their democratic deepening as much as it might
have damaged the prospects for democracy in Russia and Venezuela. All
four countries suffered severe economic downturns in the 1990s: what
differed is that in Russia and Venezuela those took place during
democratic spells and helped to delegitimize democracy, while in
Indonesia and Mexico it was autocrats whose legitimacy was stained by
economic crisis. The ability for new leaders in all four countries to
mark off their respective new governments as a complete departure from
the past may well have been enhanced by the oil boom of the 2000s.

ELITE RESISTANCE TO TRANSFORMING THE SYSTEM

Mass impoverishment causes mass discontent. But in the case study
countries discussed above, [discontent has **rarely translated** into
effective popular action to **transform the system**.]{.underline}

[Oil has a **bad reputation** among those supporting
**democracy**.]{.underline} A central assumption of the political
economy of oil-producing states is that oil revenues insulate the
governing regime from popular demands by rendering rulers independent of
citizen taxpayers. This situation can have contrasting outcomes.
Governments can invest in long-term national policies and override the
vagaries of bond markets and creditor conditionalities, but they can
also consume themselves with factional politicking or spend their
patrimony on conspicuous consumption or prestige projects without any
public good. Countries that suddenly obtain oil rents can move in an
authoritarian direction; Kuwait is an example.62

[The logic of this report might optimistically imply the
reverse]{.underline}, namely, [that [if]{.mark}]{.underline} these oil
[[rents were **withdrawn**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[states
would]{.underline}]{.mark} lose their financial autonomy and [[become
subject to]{.mark} popular pressure for
**[democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But [[there is **scant evidence**
for this]{.underline}]{.mark} outcome. In most of the cases discussed
here, political systems remained under elite control.

Several countries witnessed some form of large-scale nonviolent civic
protests during or after decarbonization. Civic mobilization is complex,
and the profile of leaders and mass movements is specific to each
country. However, most protests followed a well-established pattern:
they were sparked by material issues---such as the price of bread,
unemployment, the lack of electricity during summer---and then expanded
to demand broader systemic change.63 But [[**even** when they
won]{.mark} remarkable concessions]{.underline}, including changes in
government, the [[popular]{.underline}]{.mark} protest [[movements were
unable to effect transformational change.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In every country, even amid violent political conflict and turmoil,
people organize to press for peace, democracy, law, and justice.64
Indeed, large-scale protests remain one of the few ways to effectively
challenge the fundamentals of a political system. However, the
[[protests]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves, [and any gains
they]{.underline} might [make]{.underline}, constantly [run the
[risk]{.mark} of [being **overwhelmed**]{.mark}]{.underline} or
**[[co-opted]{.underline}]{.mark}** by transactional elite politics
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} simply **[[crushed]{.mark} with
violence]{.underline}**.65

[**[Iraq's]{.mark}** historic [protests]{.mark} in
2019]{.underline}---targeting "endemic corruption, economic decline, and
endless cycles of violent conflict that have marked the post-2003
system"---[[ended in **repression** and]{.mark} **elite
[retrenchment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.66 Security forces opened fire on
protesters, killing and wounding hundreds.67 Political parties and armed
groups also deployed other tactics with impunity, including targeted
assassinations, detention, torture, and intimidation of civil society
and activists. **[[Nigeria's]{.underline}]{.mark}** #EndSARS
[[protests]{.underline}]{.mark}---referencing Nigeria's Special
Anti-Robbery Squad---broke out in 2020, sparked by the extrajudicial
killing of an unarmed civilian, and grew to encompass public outrage
over corruption and governmental abuse of power.68 The protests [[turned
violent]{.mark} and were met with repression]{.underline}; and despite
the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in name, other
paramilitary units have carried on as before.69

**[[Sudan]{.underline}]{.mark}** provides the most tragic example of the
endurance of entrenched kleptocrats. After popular discontent caused
Bashir's fall in April 2019, a transitional government [promised to pave
the way toward democratic transition. It [did **not
last**]{.mark}]{.underline}. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of
the Sudanese Armed Forces, and Hemedti, flush from funds from gold and
bolstered by support from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, undermined the
civilian government.70 In October 2021, they overthrew the government
and took power themselves. [Despite]{.underline} the churn among the
elite, and despite the extraordinarily courageous [pro-democracy
protests]{.underline}, which continued to agitate against the military
takeover until the outbreak of civil war in April 2023, [[the broader
system of]{.mark} violent, [transactional politics]{.mark} in Sudan has
[remained]{.mark}]{.underline} largely the same.71

The [Canada Energy Regulator's new scenarios for the future of Canadian
energy show significant reductions in oil and gas production as the
country works to reach net zero emissions by 2050.]{.underline} But
[**[Canada doesn't have to reduce oil and gas production to achieve net
zero]{.underline}**.]{.mark} And as global energy demand continues
rising, **[[phasing out responsibly produced supply]{.mark} from Canada
would [hurt the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Climate change is a global
problem. [Canada's efforts to reduce emissions -- particularly in the
energy industry -- must be in the context of what is happening around
the world, which the CER does not model in detail.]{.underline} Here are
the facts. Fact: **[The [CER scenario does not reflect
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}** The [CER's "global net zero" scenario,
similar to the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s net zero scenario, is
one way of looking at how the future could unfold. But it **doesn't
reflect the trajectory the world is actually on.**]{.underline} For
example, [**[if the world was following the IEA's net zero
course]{.mark}, [global oil demand would be declining now,]{.mark}** on
its way to 75 million barrels per day by 2030. **[In reality]{.mark}, it
is [set to hit a new record]{.mark} [high]{.mark}** of 102 million
barrels per day this year and reach 106 million barrels per day in 2028,
according to the IEA's latest short-term outlook.]{.underline} Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, with painful price spikes and the world's
highest-ever consumption of coal last year has underscored the world's
energy challenge. [**[Renewables alone are not enough to provide the
reliable, affordable energy]{.mark} we need. The [world will need oil
and gas long into the future.]{.mark} [If Canada]{.mark} intentionally
[phases out]{.mark} its [supply]{.mark}, the [world's demand will still
be met]{.mark} --** not by Canada, benefitting Canadians, but
**[by]{.mark} jurisdictions like [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia and
[Russia]{.mark}, which [don't share]{.mark} our [commitment to
environmental protection]{.mark} or social progress.**]{.underline} It's
important to note that Canada does not have to introduce specific
legislation to reduce oil and gas production for that result to come
about. Policy could just as easily shrink production via indirect means,
the Public Policy Form (PPF) noted earlier this year, . This includes
"limiting pipeline or other infrastructure approvals and permits,
constraining or discouraging investment, or setting an emissions cap
level so stringent it is only achievable through production cuts," PPF
said. Directly or indirectly, this "would deny existing producers the
opportunity to innovate their way to a net-zero future."

Fact: **[[Canada does not have to single out oil and gas to reach net
zero]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is [not necessary for Canada to
intentionally phase out oil and gas production]{.underline} to achieve
net zero emissions, according to analysis by Navius Research for the
PPF. **[Such a [phase out "introduces economic pain with no added
environmental gain."]{.mark} Reducing emissions is not the same as
eliminating oil and gas]{.underline}**, PPF noted. Navius Research found
that [[phasing out Canadian oil and gas]{.mark}, rather than investing
in non-emitting sources while reducing emissions from oil and
gas]{.underline}, would **[[cost Canada's economy \$100 billion by
2050]{.mark} -- the equivalent of a [deep recession with no
recovery]{.mark} ever materializing.]{.underline}** Phasing out Canada's
oil and gas production would reduce the incomes of everyday Canadians,
and damage Canada's exports by crippling its largest trade offering, PPF
said. Most importantly, **[Canada can achieve net zero emissions more
cost effectively by not singling out the oil and gas
sector.]{.underline}** Overall, the CER does not model the economic
impacts of its pathways to net zero. This is critical information that
should be made public to Canadians. Fact: **[[Canadian natural gas can
reduce global emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}** Climate change is a
global issue, so solutions should be global in nature. For example,
**[switching from [coal to natural gas]{.mark} to generate power
[reduces emissions by 50 per cent]{.mark} on average]{.underline}**,
according to the IEA. Supply from Canada -- exported globally as
[liquefied natural gas (**[LNG]{.mark})** can do even better**,
[reduc]{.mark}ing emissions [by]{.mark} about [65]{.mark} per cent
compared to coal,**]{.underline} according to Energy for a Secure
Future. Analysts expect world LNG demand to double over the next two
decades as growing Asian economies look to get off high-emitting coal.
LNG is now also seen a core energy supply source for Europe following
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thanks to a **[[colder climate]{.mark},
[lower methane emissions]{.mark} from natural gas production, and the
[use of hydroelectricity,]{.mark} [Canada's LNG will have some of the
lowest emissions in the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A 2022 study by
Wood Mackenzie found that **[Canadian LNG exports could [reduce net
emissions in]{.mark} Asia [by 188 million tonnes per year through
2050.]{.mark}]{.underline}** That's the annual equivalent of removing
nearly three times B.C.'s total emissions, or getting rid of all
internal combustion engine cars from Canadian roads. If Canada shuts
down its ability to supply the world with LNG, it will not change
demand. The demand will just be met by other countries like the United
States, Qatar and Australia.

Fact: **[[Canadian oil and gas projects benefit Indigenous
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indigenous businesses and communities
are becoming increasingly important players in Canadian oil and gas, and
that's good for Canada and the world. "When Europeans, Asians and
Americans think of Canada's Indigenous peoples, they often think we
oppose all energy development. We aren't victims of development.
Increasingly we are partners and even owners in major projects," Haisla
Nation Chief Councillor Crystal Smith said during a press conference in
April. The **[[Haisla Nation]{.mark} is [50 per cent owner of]{.mark}
the proposed [Cedar LNG project]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which would be
the [first Indigenous-owned LNG terminal in the world.]{.underline} The
**[Haisla Nation views it as an [opportunity to take ownership of
industrial development on their lands]{.mark} and to [use revenues to
support local social, educational and health
programs.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It's just one example of the growing
role of Indigenous communities in Canadian energy. **[[Indigenous
communities]{.mark} will [have a stake in the LNG Canada]{.mark} project
development as well]{.underline}**, with 16 communities to acquire a 10%
stake in the Coastal GasLink pipeline once complete in 2023. In Alberta,
23 First Nation and Métis communities are now approximately 12 per cent
owners of seven operating Enbridge oil sands pipelines, the largest
Indigenous energy transaction ever in North America. Since 2014,
Indigenous employment in Canada's oil and gas sector has increased by
more than 20 per cent, reaching an estimated 10,400 jobs in 2020,
according to the federal government. Together, **[three
projects]{.underline}** -- the Trans Mountain Expansion, Coastal
GasLink, and LNG Canada -- have **[spent approximately \$9 billion with
Indigenous-owned and local businesses. [Phasing out Canada's oil and gas
industry would remove these opportunities from Indigenous
communities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fact: **[[Canada's oil sands
industry has a credible path to net zero]{.mark} [Six companies]{.mark}
representing [95 per cent of Canada's oil sands production]{.mark} have
jointly [committed to]{.mark} [reaching net zero]{.mark} emissions by
2050.]{.underline}** This is important as [most of Canada's oil
production comes from the oil sands sector.]{.underline} The anchor
project of the group's target to reduce emissions by 22 million tonnes
by 2030 on the way to net zero by 2050 is [carbon capture and storage
(CCS) technology.]{.underline} According to international bodies
including the IEA and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, dramatic expansion of CCS operations around the world is
vital to achieve climate targets. Both of CER's new net zero scenarios
recognize the key role CCS will play in reducing emissions.
**[[Canada]{.mark} is already a [leader in]{.mark} the
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, with five of the world's 30
commercial CCS facilities. This accounts for about 15 per cent of global
CCS capacity even though Canada generates less than two per cent of
global CO2 emissions. **[Canada's [CCS op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} are
[working]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since 2000, CCS projects in
Saskatchewan and Alberta have removed more than 47 million tonnes of
emissions, or the equivalent of taking more than 10 million cars off the
road. **[[Emissions in]{.mark} Canada's "conventional" ([non-oil
sands]{.mark}) oil [sector]{.mark} are already [going
down]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to Environment and Climate Change
Canada's latest report to the United Nations, emissions from
conventional oil production were 26 megatonnes in 2021, down from 34
megatonnes in 2019. The **[world will need oil for decades to
come]{.underline}**. **[[Supply from Canada]{.mark}, where producers are
committed to emissions reduction, [is better for the
planet]{.mark}]{.underline}** than supply from other countries that do
not share the same commitment to innovation. Fact: **[[Oil and gas
benefits all Canadians]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Government of Canada
acknowledges that oil and gas is a **[[major contributor to Canada's
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Ottawa reports that oil and gas
supported nearly **[[600,000 jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}** across Canada
in 2020. This includes **[178,500 "direct" jobs with oil and gas
companies and 415,000 "indirect" jobs in supporting industries like
engineering and manufacturing.]{.underline}** In addition to the
concentration of jobs in oil and gas producing provinces, there are
**[thousands of jobs in manufacturing, environmental, and financial
services tied to the oil and gas industry]{.underline}**, especially in
Ontario and Quebec. In 2020, the **[oil and gas industry generated
[\$118 billion in GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Canada's total GDP in 2020
was \$1.65 trillion, indicating that the oil and gas sector accounted
for about **[[7.2 per cent]{.mark} of the country's economic
activity.]{.underline}** At the same time, [**Canada [exported \$86
billion]{.mark} worth of oil and gas [in 2020]{.mark}, or [16 per
cent]{.mark} of the country's total.** Of those exports, 95 per cent
went to the U.S. **These economic benefits would evaporate without
Canadian oil and gas production**]{.underline}. Fact: Oil and gas still
needed in IEA net zero scenario Even in the IEA's highly unlikely net
zero scenario, **[in 2050 nearly 20 per cent of world energy needs are
still supplied by oil and gas.]{.underline}** This includes
non-combustion uses like petrochemical feedstock and asphalt, which
crude from Canada's oil sands is particularly well suited to supply.
Researchers with Queen's University recently found that asphalt from
Alberta's oil sands can extend pavement lifespan by 30 to 50 per cent.

**[Albertans are sick and tired of being told to sit and take

Pundits on national television shows, generally taped in Ottawa or
Toronto, have been [speculating about the sentiment in
Alberta]{.underline}, patronizing an entire province because they
clearly don't understand what is occurring. [What's happening in Alberta
**isn't a temper tantrum just to get attention**]{.underline}---**[there
are serious considerations as to whether the relationship we have with
the federal government still works for us.]{.underline}** For decades,
[Ottawa has treated Alberta like the bratty younger brother it only
calls when they want something]{.underline}. But here's the thing: [you
can't keep calling Canada a]{.underline} "**[strong
partnership]{.underline}**" [while draining Alberta's resources and
sending our money overseas]{.underline} instead, [ignoring our concerns,
and talking down to us every time we push back.]{.underline} In the
words of one Taylor Allison Swift, "**[don't think it's in the past.
These kinds of wounds, they last and they last]{.underline}**" [And now
we see Albertans are officially entering their "leave it all behind"
era.]{.underline} A new Angus Reid poll says **[36 percent of Albertans
support leaving Canada]{.underline}**. [A month before that, it was 30
percent]{.underline}. [That's not just the grumblings of a few rural UCP
voters]{.underline}. That's a **[growing, organized, frustrated movement
that is being ignored and mocked]{.underline}**. And it's not hard to
see why. [Premier Danielle Smith recently introduced legislation to make
it easier for Albertans to trigger a referendum]{.underline}, and that
certainly doesn't rule out one on secession.2 For Albertans frustrated
with our treatment from Ottawa, **[that's a live wire waiting to be
struck]{.underline}**. [We've seen this film before]{.underline}. Back
in 1982, a separatist from the Western Canada Concept actually won a
seat in the Alberta Legislature, right in the then-constituency of
Olds-Didsbury. It may have just been a short-lived protest vote then.
But [sometimes history rears its head,]{.underline} and we see ourselves
right back where we were when we don't learn the lessons of the past.
(And yes, there's a certain high-profile by-election in that same riding
this year.) **[Let's not pretend this is all just noise.]{.underline}**
[When Quebec held its 1995 referendum, the "Yes" side came within a
single point of leaving Canada]{.underline}. [The federal government had
been sitting pretty with a 20-point lead in the polls...until the
campaign started]{.underline}. Identity, frustration, and a sense of
pride took over, and **[Canada nearly split in two]{.underline}**. Sound
familiar? I keep hearing people say, "Well, Alberta can't just leave.
There's the Constitution. The Clarity Act. You need a clear question, a
clear majority, and a national constitutional amendment." That's all
true. But what happens if Albertans do vote to leave, and the House of
Commons and the other provinces block it? The frustration will multiply,
and we will have a real crisis on our hands.3 **[This isn't about waving
a separatist flag]{.underline}**. [It's about being sick and tired of
being told to sit down and be quiet while decisions that shape our
economy and our future are made in Ottawa boardrooms without
us.4]{.underline} Let's be clear: [**if Alberta's voice keeps being
ignored, the chorus calling for separation will only get louder.** If
Ottawa wants this federation to stay together, it needs to stop treating
Alberta like the problem child and start treating us like a
partner.]{.underline} [Alberta has the natural resources needed to help
our country grow in these uncertain times; we have the produce that
people around the world desire, giving us a leading chance at expanding
our trade relationships, and we have a world-class innovation hub that
can build us all up.]{.underline} For Ottawa, maybe it isn't love, it
isn't hate, it's just indifference. For Alberta, maybe everything has
changed.

Following last month's Liberal election victory, and after a decade of
damaging federal policies by the Trudeau government, some **[Albertans
are calling for a referendum on separation]{.underline}**. While Premier
Danielle Smith said she does not support separation she "will honour"
the referendum process. And according to a recent poll, **[more than
one-third of Albertans are open to leaving Canada]{.underline}**. But
whether or not the referendum actually happens, one thing is
clear---[Albertans have reason to be frustrated with
confederation.]{.underline} In our current system, Ottawa collects taxes
from people and businesses across the country then transfers that money
to Canadians for federal and national programs including the Canada
Pension Plan (CPP) and employment insurance. [Albertans contribute
disproportionately to this system thanks to the province's relatively
high rates of employment, higher average incomes and younger
population.]{.underline} For example, from 1981 to 2022 (the latest year
of available data), [Albertans' net contribution to the
CPP]{.underline}---meaning the amount Albertans paid into the program
over and above what retirees in Alberta received in CPP benefit
payments---[was \$53.6 billion]{.underline}. British Columbia was the
only other province where workers paid more into the CPP than retirees
received in benefits---and Alberta's contribution was six times greater
than B.C.'s contribution. On equalization---Canada's transfer program
aimed at ensuring each province can provide comparable levels of public
services---[Alberta has not received payments since
1964]{.underline}/65. In 2022 (the latest year of available data), the
[federal government spent \$21.9 billion on equalization while 13.5 per
cent of total federal revenue came from Alberta, which means Alberta
taxpayers contributed an estimated \$3.0 billion to the equalization
program that year---while receiving no payments.]{.underline} More
broadly, [Alberta's total net contribution to federal finances and
national programs]{.underline} (that is, total federal taxes and
payments paid by Albertans minus federal money spent or transferred to
Albertans) [was \$244.6 billion from 2007 to 2022---more than five times
more than the net contribution from British Columbians or
Ontarians]{.underline} (the only other two net contributors) [despite
Alberta's smaller population.]{.underline} So that's the
reality---**[Alberta massively overcontributes]{.underline}** to federal
and national programs. But that's not necessarily a problem, in and of
itself. The problem is that [despite Alberta's outsized importance

will "change things at the federal level that need to be changed in

both the emissions cap and Bill C-69. That would be welcomed news in
Alberta, which continues to punch above its economic weight despite
federal policies that prevent the province from reaching its full
economic potential. [And any policies that restrict Alberta ultimately

many Albertans are frustrated with the status quo. **[Federal policies

time to undo these federal policies, for the benefit of all Canadians.

#### Net-zero projects cause [Alberta secession]{.underline} -- perserveing the oil and gas sector at [all costs]{.underline} are the primary motivations for separatists

\["Danielle Smith says separation is about alienation. It's really about
oil," *The Narwhal*, May 8 2025,

The day after the federal election that saw Mark Carney installed as
prime minister, Alberta's premier, Danielle Smith, introduced sweeping
changes to democracy in Alberta. Among those changes was a [relaxation
of the rules around referendums, paving the way for a separation
vote]{.underline}. All of it is **[driven by a perception]{.underline}**
that **[Alberta's prosperity is under attack]{.underline}** by a hostile
force. According to the premier, [that hostile force is]{.underline} not
the U.S. and its tariffs or threats of annexation. It's
**[Ottawa]{.underline}**. Underlying it all? "**[Alberta's prosperity"
is shorthand for the oil and gas industry.]{.underline}** And the move
to relax referendum rules is not a reaction to the current state of
affairs --- it's the Smith government seizing a moment to institute a
long-held and oil-rooted plan called the Free Alberta Strategy. Smith
swept into power with her long-time political ally Rob Anderson at her
side as her chief of staff, and tucked neatly under his arm was a
strategy to pull Alberta from confederation --- partially if possible,
entirely if need be. "[Alberta's treatment within Canada has become
intolerable]{.underline}," Anderson and his co-authors wrote in the Free
Alberta Strategy in 2021, adding the [federal government had undertaken
an "assault" on "Alberta's largest and most critical industry," meaning,
of course, **the oil and gas sector.**]{.underline} Throughout her short
reign, Smith and Anderson have followed that plan closely, and appear to
be capitalizing on both an international crisis and an election that
didn't go their way to pave the way for more extreme aspects of the
plan. Smith is not wrong that the [oil and gas sector is of huge
economic importance in Alberta --- a one-dollar swing in the price of a
barrel can mean \$750 million more (or less) in the provincial
budget.]{.underline} The sector is also not disappearing anytime soon.

the environment you won't find anywhere else. Stay tapped in by signing
up for a weekly dose of our ad‑free, independent journalism. But while
blaming the industry's fortunes squarely on Ottawa, and pushing the
narrative of a shared enemy might be good for amping up vitriol, the
strategy does little to help her lead the province through an era of
intense uncertainty. It's an era that will have a profound effect on
Alberta's future and on the future of its oil and gas industry. [Free
Alberta Strategy is the backbone of Smith's rhetoric, and centred on oil
and gas woes]{.underline} The Free Alberta Strategy, written by
Anderson, along with University of Calgary political science professor
Barry Cooper and lawyer Derek From, [calls for the province to institute
several measures in response to what it calls "sustained federal attacks
on Alberta"]{.underline} --- attacks, it says, [that are largely centred
on the oil and gas industry, from the consumer carbon tax]{.underline}
(which has since been eliminated) [to federal environmental assessment
legislation to a ban on oil tankers]{.underline} off the B.C. coast.
[The first order of business to fight back]{.underline}, according to
the strategy, is to enact the Alberta Sovereignty Act, which Smith did
as her first order of business. The next steps the strategy outlines
include the creation of an Alberta police force, and pulling the
province out of the Canada Pension Plan. The strategy also says [Alberta
should opt out of all federal programs that it sees as interfering with
provincial jurisdiction]{.underline}, including education, resource
development, environmental regulation, property rights and health. While
attempts at creating a provincial pension plan have faltered, and the
creation of a police force carries on piecemeal following clear public
disinterest, the provincial government has leaned into the [argument of
**economic carnage** and the need to **protect Alberta's energy sector**
from Ottawa.]{.underline} Prime Minister and Liberal Leader Mark Carney
speaks at a podium outside Rideau Hall in Ottawa. Prime Minister Mark
Carney faces two challenges to national unity, one from the United
States and another, perhaps related, from the Alberta government of
Danielle Smith. Photo: Kamara Morozuk / The Narwhal In the strategy,
this would prohibit "attempts by federal agencies to regulate our
province's energy sector in any manner." In practice, the Smith
government has introduced amendments to its Critical Infrastructure
Defence Act that would attempt to bar federal employees from facilities
that track and compile emissions data --- even private facilities that
are not operated by the Alberta government. The province is also
challenging draft federal clean electricity legislation in court and
making demands of the Liberal government all tied to opening more oil
and gas exploration, which Alberta wants to double. If those demands are
not met, there could be a "national unity crisis," Smith said prior to
Carney's election. In a list of demands the Alberta government presented
to Prime Minister Carney on May 5, only one wasn't directly linked to
oil and gas --- a call to completely overhaul equalization payments, in
which funds are redistributed across the country from wealthier regions.
In Alberta, those payouts are inseparably linked to the fortunes wrought
from the oil and gas sector. Now, days after the federal vote, Smith is
echoing the Free Alberta Strategy, saying Ottawa's treatment of Alberta
has "become unbearable" and separatists in the province are not a fringe
minority, but loyal Albertans "who've just had enough of having their
livelihoods and prosperity attacked by a hostile federal government."
That's almost word for word from the Free Alberta Strategy written four
years ago. Albertan anger at Ottawa is as old as confederation Directing
anger at Ottawa isn't new in Alberta, it's a time-honoured tradition as
old as the province itself, when it entered confederation without the
same ownership of its resources as other provinces (a slight that was
later rectified). Every government in the province has used the federal
government as a foil to rally the troops and shore up political support.
That's usually a conservative government, but even the NDP stirred the
federal pot during its four-year reign. Talk of separation isn't new
either. It ebbs and flows depending on who's in power in Ottawa and the
federal policies they're enacting. Jason Kenney stands at a podium.
Former Alberta Premier Jason Kenney convened a panel to seek a better
deal in confederation for Canada, but was a staunch federalist and
didn't entertain separatist ideas. Photo: Alberta Government / Flickr
Those outbursts usually burn brightly for a moment and then flame out,
but there historically hasn't been the same level of tacit support from
the provincial government as there is today. Smith rose to power after
Jason Kenney, a staunch federalist who was shown the door by the party
he helped found. Despite the merger of two right-wing parties to form
the United Conservatives, the movement was strained between factions,
including separatists and sovereigntists on its outer flank. Smith owes
her victory to some of those outer flanks. She is from those outer
flanks, and so is her chief advisor, Anderson. It's a flank that views
the province's oil and gas industry as under assault from "hostile and
unreliable federal governments" --- and one that's willing to go to
increasingly extreme measures to defend it. [Smith government has been
laser focused on promoting Alberta oil and gas, including in anti-Ottawa
rhetoric]{.underline} Smith's government has been focused almost
entirely on [expanding and promoting Alberta's oil and gas sector in a
way that exceeds past governments]{.underline} --- a notable feat where
the sector has long padded provincial budgets. The United Conservative
Party under Smith has not only [pushed back against federal policies,
but worked to reshape Alberta's electricity grid to all but **block
renewables and encourage more natural gas consumption**. It's also
considering elimination of its industrial carbon levy. Where past
separatist or western alienation movements have focused on political
principles, including increased representation and senate reform
alongside resource development, **Smith's focus is on making more
money.** The main driver behind the Free Alberta Strategy, and the main
rhetorical assault from the premier, isn't about identity or about
politics, **it is centred on climate policies and the energy
sector.**]{.underline} Billboard ad that says \"Many countries are
asking for Canada\'s LNG.\" Beyond the Alberta government, industry and
lobby groups have been aggressively pushing back against climate and
environmental policies from the federal government, arguing for
expansion of the oil and gas sector, rather than regulations. Photo:
Kamara Morozuk / The Narwhal "The federal government has taken hostile
actions ... against our right to develop our resources," Smith said the
day after the election. She also demanded the federal government rescind
"nine offensive pieces of legislation and policy that prevent us from
being able to exercise our constitutional jurisdiction to develop our
resources." Her list includes asking for the establishment of guaranteed
economic corridors (think: pipelines), the repealing of federal
environmental assessment legislation, the lifting of a tanker ban off
the coast of B.C., the elimination of the proposed oil and gas emissions
cap, scrapping federal clean electricity regulations, ending "treatment
of plastics as toxic," abandoning net-zero vehicle mandates, returning
oversight of industrial carbon taxes fully to provinces and halting "the
federal censorship of energy companies." Every one of those demands
relates to the oil and gas industry. Lisa Young, a political scientist
at the University of Calgary, writes in a post about the separation
issue that there appear to be two types of Alberta separatists these
days, the true believers who imagine a free Alberta "as some kind of
conservative utopia (like, well, Trump's America)" and
"instrumentalists" who want to use the threat to get concessions (think
Quebec). The Free Alberta Strategy adds a third group, those who would
never separate. It labels them as "well-meaning and sincere," but says
they "have not learned from history." It's clear Smith isn't in the last
group, but it's not clear precisely where her true feelings lie. If her
intent is to use threats to wrangle concessions for the oil sector, it
comes at a dangerous time to play such games --- or providential,
depending on your view. Separation rhetoric could have unintended
effects for pipelines and more If Alberta were to vote to separate, some
of the issues raised in the Free Alberta Strategy and the still minority
separatist movement, would only be exacerbated. "The world looks at us
like we've lost our minds," Smith said in her address to Albertans on
May 5. "[We have the most abundant and accessible natural resources of
any country on Earth, and yet we landlock them, sell what we do produce
to a single customer, to the south of us, while enabling polluting
dictatorships to eat our lunch.]{.underline}" The strategy, too, rails
against landlocked resources and lays the blame at the federal
government. Secession would sever its official ties to neighbours the
province would need to help industry get its products overseas or across
borders. And it would face the once-unlikely, and now all-too-real,
prospect of being consumed by that single customer Smith highlighted in
her speech. If Smith really is using the threats as a means to coerce
changes to legislation her government does not like, she may awaken
forces well beyond her control, which ends well outside her intentions.

rise, including selling oilsands crude on the international market and

University of Alberta political scientist Jared Wesley notes, the
demands she has raised in her address aren't based on national
consensus, and will "face significant constitutional and political
hurdles that, if not overcome, could end up inflaming frustrations among
her base rather than resolving them." Providing a wedge as Canada faces
a threat from the United States, and requires a united front in order to
hold off the worst of the trade war, raises some serious questions about
motivation. In her address, [Smith warned Albertans to stand unified
against forces]{.underline}, inside and outside of the province, [that
would try to instill fear and distrust]{.underline}, before lashing out
at those who would disagree with her views, and those of her government.
"[They will seek to divide us into different camps for the purposes of
marginalizing and vilifying one another based on differing opinions,
effectively pitting neighbour against neighbour and Albertan against
Albertan,]{.underline}" she said, without irony. Smith's government is
making it clear that **[there is one vision of Alberta]{.underline}**,
[and it is centred on a specific politics and a specific
industry]{.underline}. **[Anything else is un-Albertan and won't be
tolerated]{.underline}**. [She will break up the country to ensure
that's so.]{.underline} But perhaps it shouldn't be her words that we
listen to. "Albertans," she said in her address, "are more of an
'actions speak louder than words, kind of people.' " The actions of her
government, and of her inner circle, speak volumes.

Canada's economic mediocrity]{.underline}**," *Globe and Mail*, April 8

Many observers have noted [Canada's underperformance in terms of GDP per
capita]{.underline} relative to other industrialized countries since
2015, a period often referred to as "the lost decade." However, little
effort is put into analyzing the **[source of this mediocre
performance]{.underline}**, and without understanding the cause, it is
difficult to provide solutions. This period should be called "the lost
decades" -- plural -- as [Canada's slide into economic mediocrity
started well before 2015.]{.underline} Having followed an almost
identical upward trend since the early 1990s, GDP per capita in Canada
and the United States started to diverge at the end of 2014. [The timing
of this break coincides with the drop in oil pric]{.underline}es in late
2014 and the collapse in capital expenditure in the oil and gas sector
that followed. Looking at the composition of GDP and the drivers of the
relative GDP per capita performance between Canada and the U.S., we
reach a crucial observation: [The oil boom that ended in 2014 obscured
the mediocre performance of the rest of the Canadian economy,
particularly in manufacturing.]{.underline} Between 2000 and 2014, [the
investment boom in oil and gas would have led to an outperformance in
Canada's GDP relative to the U.S.]{.underline} However, continued subpar
performance in exports and in the manufacturing sector fully offset this
outperformance, leaving Canada's GDP per capita to evolve in line with
that of the U.S. Since 2014, the collapse in oil and gas has meant the
industry gradually became a drag on Canada's GDP, while the
underperformance of other sectors continued. Moreover, slower disposable
income growth led to an underperformance in household spending. This
situation left the non-energy sectors unable to drive Canada's
prosperity. To understand how to boost Canada's prosperity, it's crucial
to recognize 1) why GDP-per-capita growth never really came back,
remaining subdued despite favourable oil prices in recent years and 2)
why the [non-energy sectors have seen such mediocre performance over the
past two decades and a half.]{.underline} The **[lack of rebound in GDP
is a result of a lack of oil and gas investment]{.underline}** in recent
years. That is not unique to Canada. Globally, oil and gas companies are
returning a greater share of their revenues to shareholders and
reinvesting a smaller share in their operations. The situation suggests
a global shift in shareholders' preferences is likely the main reason
for the sector's lack of investment rather than Canadian-specific
factors. And a [lack of investment translates into a lack of growth for
the sector and beyond. In terms of the non-energy sectors, a lack of
competitiveness is likely the main culprit for their poor
performance.]{.underline} **[Chronic underinvestment]{.underline}**
**[over multiple decades]{.underline}** is the cause of weak
productivity performance in Canada. [Canada spends almost as much on
home renovations]{.underline} and homeownership transfer costs
(**[non-productive investment]{.underline}**) [as it spends on
machinery, equipment and intellectual property]{.underline} investment
(**[productive investment]{.underline}**). More importantly, there is
evidence that household borrowing over the past 30 years has crowded out
business investment. These issues with the resource and non-resource
sectors during a commodity boom suggest the [Canadian economy may have
suffered from "Dutch Disease," when **outperformance of a single
commodity raises the currency**,]{.underline} [harming exports and thus
the overall economy]{.underline}. However, globalization may have played
a much bigger role in the underperformance of the manufacturing sector,
especially in light of weak competitiveness. To solve Canada's economic
problems, [policy makers must consider how to make the non-energy
sectors competitive again.]{.underline} This will involve ensuring
businesses have the incentives and the resources to spend on productive
investment and enhance their competitiveness.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with painful price spikes and the world's
highest-ever consumption of coal last year has underscored the world's
energy challenge. [Renewables alone are not enough to provide the
reliable, affordable energy we need]{.underline}. [The world will need
oil and gas long into the future. If Canada intentionally phases out its
supply]{.underline}, [the world's demand will still be met]{.underline}
-- [not by Canada, benefitting Canadians, but by jurisdictions like
Saudi Arabia and Russia, which don't share our commitment to
environmental protection or social progress.]{.underline} It's important
to note that Canada does not have to introduce specific legislation to
reduce oil and gas production for that result to come about. Policy
could just as easily shrink production via indirect means, the Public
Policy Form (PPF) noted earlier this year, . This includes "limiting
pipeline or other infrastructure approvals and permits, constraining or
discouraging investment, or setting an emissions cap level so stringent
it is only achievable through production cuts," PPF said. [Directly or
indirectly, this "would deny existing producers the opportunity to
innovate their way to a net-zero future."]{.underline} Fact: Canada does
not have to single out oil and gas to reach net zero It is not necessary
for Canada to intentionally phase out oil and gas production to achieve
net zero emissions, according to analysis by Navius Research for the
PPF. Such a phase out "introduces economic pain with no added
environmental gain." Reducing emissions is not the same as eliminating
oil and gas, PPF noted. Navius Research found that phasing out Canadian
oil and gas, rather than investing in non-emitting sources while
reducing emissions from oil and gas, would cost Canada's economy \$100
billion by 2050 -- the equivalent of a deep recession with no recovery
ever materializing. Phasing out Canada's oil and gas production would
reduce the incomes of everyday Canadians, and damage Canada's exports by
crippling its largest trade offering, PPF said. Most importantly, Canada
can achieve net zero emissions more cost effectively by not singling out
the oil and gas sector. Overall, the CER does not model the economic
impacts of its pathways to net zero. This is critical information that
should be made public to Canadians. Fact: Canadian natural gas can
reduce global emissions Climate change is a global issue, so solutions
should be global in nature. For example, switching from coal to natural
gas to generate power reduces emissions by 50 per cent on average,
according to the IEA. Supply from Canada -- exported globally as
liquefied natural gas (LNG) can do even better, reducing emissions by
about 65 per cent compared to coal, according to Energy for a Secure
Future. Analysts expect world LNG demand to double over the next two
decades as growing Asian economies look to get off high-emitting coal.
LNG is now also seen a core energy supply source for Europe following
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [Thanks to a colder climate, lower methane
emissions from natural gas production, and the use of hydroelectricity,
Canada's LNG will have some of the lowest emissions in the
world.]{.underline} A 2022 study by Wood Mackenzie found that Canadian
LNG exports could reduce net emissions in Asia by 188 million tonnes per
year through 2050. That's the annual equivalent of removing nearly three
times B.C.'s total emissions, or getting rid of all internal combustion
engine cars from Canadian roads. I[f Canada shuts down its ability to
supply the world with LNG**, it will not change demand**.]{.underline}
The demand will just be met by other countries like the United States,
Qatar and Australia. Fact: Canadian oil and gas projects benefit
Indigenous communities Indigenous businesses and communities are
becoming increasingly important players in Canadian oil and gas, and
that's good for Canada and the world. "When Europeans, Asians and
Americans think of Canada's Indigenous peoples, they often think we
oppose all energy development. We aren't victims of development.
Increasingly we are partners and even owners in major projects," Haisla
Nation Chief Councillor Crystal Smith said during a press conference in
April. The Haisla Nation is 50 per cent owner of the proposed Cedar LNG
project, which would be the first Indigenous-owned LNG terminal in the
world. The Haisla Nation views it as an opportunity to take ownership of
industrial development on their lands and to use revenues to support
local social, educational and health programs. It's just one example of
the growing role of Indigenous communities in Canadian energy.
Indigenous communities will have a stake in the LNG Canada project
development as well, with 16 communities to acquire a 10% stake in the
Coastal GasLink pipeline once complete in 2023. In Alberta, 23 First
Nation and Métis communities are now approximately 12 per cent owners of
seven operating Enbridge oil sands pipelines, the largest Indigenous
energy transaction ever in North America. Since 2014, Indigenous
employment in Canada's oil and gas sector has increased by more than 20
per cent, reaching an estimated 10,400 jobs in 2020, according to the
federal government. Together, three projects -- the Trans Mountain
Expansion, Coastal GasLink, and LNG Canada -- have spent approximately
\$9 billion with Indigenous-owned and local businesses. Phasing out
Canada's oil and gas industry would remove these opportunities from
Indigenous communities. Fact: Canada's oil sands industry has a credible
path to net zero Six companies representing 95 per cent of Canada's oil
sands production have jointly committed to reaching net zero emissions
by 2050. This is important as most of Canada's oil production comes from
the oil sands sector. The anchor project of the group's target to reduce
emissions by 22 million tonnes by 2030 on the way to net zero by 2050 is
carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. According to international
bodies including the IEA and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, dramatic expansion of CCS operations around the world
is vital to achieve climate targets. Both of CER's new net zero
scenarios recognize the key role CCS will play in reducing emissions.
Canada is already a leader in the technology, with five of the world's
30 commercial CCS facilities. This accounts for about 15 per cent of
global CCS capacity even though Canada generates less than two per cent
of global CO2 emissions. Canada's CCS operations are working. Since
2000, CCS projects in Saskatchewan and Alberta have removed more than 47
million tonnes of emissions, or the equivalent of taking more than 10
million cars off the road. Emissions in Canada's "conventional" (non-oil
sands) oil sector are already going down. According to Environment and
Climate Change Canada's latest report to the United Nations, emissions
from conventional oil production were 26 megatonnes in 2021, down from
34 megatonnes in 2019. The world will need oil for decades to come.
Supply from Canada, where producers are committed to emissions
reduction, is better for the planet than supply from other countries
that do not share the same commitment to innovation. Fact: **[Oil and
gas benefits all Canadians]{.underline}** The Government of Canada
acknowledges that oil and gas is a major contributor to Canada's
economy. Ottawa reports [that oil and gas supported nearly 600,000 jobs
across Canada in 2020]{.underline}. This includes [178,500 "direct" jobs
with oil and gas companies and 415,000 "indirect" jobs in supporting
industries like engineering and manufacturing.]{.underline} In addition
to the concentration of jobs in oil and gas producing provinces, [there
are thousands of jobs in manufacturing, environmental, and financial
services tied to the oil and gas industry]{.underline}, especially in
Ontario and Quebec. In 2020, [the oil and gas industry generated \$118
billion in GDP.]{.underline} Canada's total GDP in 2020 was \$1.65
trillion, indicating that the oil and gas sector accounted for about 7.2
per cent of the country's economic activity. At the same time, [Canada
exported \$86 billion worth of oil and gas in 2020, or 16 per cent of
the country's total. Of those exports, 95 per cent went to the U.S.
**These economic benefits would evaporate without Canadian oil and gas
production.**]{.underline} Fact: Oil and gas still needed in IEA net
zero scenario Even in the IEA's highly unlikely net zero scenario, in
2050 nearly 20 per cent of world energy needs are still supplied by oil
and gas. This includes non-combustion uses like petrochemical feedstock
and asphalt, which crude from Canada's oil sands is particularly well
suited to supply. Researchers with Queen's University recently found
that [asphalt from Alberta's oil sands can extend pavement lifespan by
30 to 50 per cent. **The world needs more Canadian oil and gas, not
less.**]{.underline}

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says the **[desire among Albertans to

following a surprise result in a recent provincial byelection that saw a
separatist candidate claim nearly 18 percent of the vote. Speaking at a
press conference in Calgary on Wednesday(June 25), Smith said the
growing support for separation is "a signal of deep frustration and
anger" in the province, particularly over federal laws that she claims
are restricting Alberta's energy sector. "**[This is not a fringe issue
anymore]{.underline}**," Smith said. "[I take that frustration
seriously, and I hope Prime Minister Mark Carney does too." The
premier\'s remarks come just weeks after **Alberta passed legislation
making it easier for citizens to trigger a provincial referendum on
separation**]{.underline}. Under Bill 54, passed on May 15, [a petition
signed by just 10 percent of voters]{.underline} (around 177,000 people)
[would be enough to force a non-binding vote on whether Alberta should
pursue independence from Canada.]{.underline} Though Smith insists she
is not personally advocating for secession, she argues that the [federal
government must act to calm the **growing unrest**]{.underline}. [She
has urged Ottawa to repeal or revise environmental and energy policies
she believes are harming Alberta's oil and gas economy, particularly the
federal Impact Assessment Act and emissions caps.]{.underline} "The ball
is in the Prime Minister's court," Smith said. "Albertans want to be
treated fairly. If we see that, the separatist movement will lose
momentum." Federal Internal Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland, who
appeared at the same event, pointed to recent legislation passed by
Parliament that aims to accelerate approval of infrastructure and energy
projects of "national interest." She urged Albertans to see this as
proof that Ottawa is prioritizing economic development. Still,
**[frustrations remain high in the western province]{.underline}**,
[where energy jobs and revenues play a crucial role. Pipeline workers,
farmers, and small business owners say they feel ignored by federal
policies crafted in faraway Ottawa.]{.underline}

into a sacrificial lamb on the altar of climate policy, ignoring the
fact that this will make Canada less competitive on the world
stage?]{.underline} Then there's the job market. [Alberta's energy
sector employs thousands and indirectly supports tens of thousands more
across Canada.]{.underline} By 2050, again according to Kaplan, Alberta
could shed 198,000 jobs -- five percent of its workforce. [These aren't
just oil rig workers; they're engineers, construction crews, transport
workers, and more.]{.underline} It gets worse. [When Alberta's economy
shrinks, **industries from coast to coast** that depend on Alberta's
vitality **will also take a hit**.]{.underline} [If even 10 to 15
percent of those job losses trickle across the country, we're looking at
another 20,000 to 30,000 Canadians joining the unemployment
line]{.underline}. Yet, where is the urgency to address this looming
crisis? [Alberta isn't just a provincial powerhouse]{.underline} --
[it's also a **major contributor to federal revenues**]{.underline}.
Between 2025 and 2050, [the province's contributions could drop by \$221
billion due to declining oil and gas revenues.]{.underline} That's less
money for healthcare, infrastructure, and social programs from coast to
coast. For a federal government that already struggles to balance its
books, **[the loss of up to \$40 billion in federal tax contributions
from Alberta is a fiscal disaster in the making]{.underline}**. [Where
do they expect to make up that shortfall? Higher taxes? Slashed
services? Or maybe another round of federal borrowing to kick the can
down the road?]{.underline} [Alberta's oil and gas isn't just a
provincial asset]{.underline} -- **[it's a critical part of Canada's
trade balance]{.underline}**. In 2022, [energy exports made up 20
percent of Canada's total exports. Cut that by more than half, and
you're **gutting Canada's international trade position**.]{.underline} A
\$[70 to 80 billion hit to export revenue could **balloon the country's
trade deficit**]{.underline}, [further **devaluing the Canadian dollar**
and making imports more expensive.]{.underline} In short, this isn't
just bad news for Alberta -- **[it's an economic calamity]{.underline}**
[that could send shockwaves through every corner of the
country.]{.underline}

**[When Alberta is economically strong, all Canadians
benefit]{.underline}**, because money is redistributed to other parts of
Canada. In 2022, [despite restrictive federal policies, Alberta
continued to **contribute disproportionately** to the
federation.]{.underline} Alberta's 5.0% real [GDP growth rate was the
fastest in Canada]{.underline} in 2022, [accounting for **17.9% of
Canada's real GDP growth**]{.underline}, despite being home to 11.6% of
the population. In 2022, 56,245 Canadian residents relocated to Alberta,
representing more than 75% of total net in-migration within Canada.
Alberta reported the **[fastest private sector employment
growth]{.underline}** among the provinces (7.8%) in 2022, accounting for
[**19.2% of private sector jobs** created in Canada]{.underline}. [Per
private sector worker, Alberta attracted \$36,412 of **business
investment, more than double the national average** (excluding
Alberta).]{.underline} From 2007 to 2022, Alberta's [net contribution to
the federal finances totalled \$244.6 billion---more than **five times
as much** as BC's]{.underline} (\$46.9 billion) [or
Ontario's]{.underline} (\$41.9 billion). In 2022, [Alberta contributed
\$14.2 billion more to federal revenues than it received back in federal
spending. If Alberta were an "average contributor]{.underline}" based on
the other provinces, rather than a large net contributor, **[the federal
government would have had a fiscal shortfall of \$16.9 billion in
2022.]{.underline}** For perspective, [to cover this net revenue loss,
the federal GST rate would need to increase from 5.0% to

During a speech on Canada Day, Prime Minister Trudeau accidentally
caused a stir by forgetting to mention Alberta when listing all of
Canada\'s provinces and territories. It was surely an oversight rather
than an intentional slight, and the prime minister immediately
apologized. Nevertheless, his slip provokes an interesting thought
experiment: [what would Canada\'s economy and public finances look like
without Alberta?]{.underline} The answer---**[not a pretty
picture.]{.underline}** Up until the recent downturn in energy prices
and subsequent recession in the province, **[Alberta contributed
disproportionately to economic growth in Canada]{.underline}**. Between
2004 and 2014, [inflation-adjusted annual economic growth in Alberta
averaged 3.4 per cent---more than twice the rate of growth in the rest
of the country]{.underline} (1.6 per cent) during the same period.
[Without Alberta\'s strong performance, Canada\'s overall economic
growth rate would have been much weaker than it was.]{.underline} To
look at another economic metric, consider that [Alberta's provincial
economy created **more jobs than any other jurisdiction** in
Canada]{.underline} between 2004 and 2014[, despite the fact that
Ontario and Quebec have vastly larger populations.]{.underline} The
job-creation machine in Alberta benefitted people from all different
parts of the country, many of whom moved to Alberta to seize economic
opportunities and make a better life for themselves. In fact,
approximately [270,000 more people moved to Alberta from the rest of the
country than moved from Alberta to somewhere else in Canada over this
10-year period]{.underline}. Providing a destination where people could
go and improve their families\' economic circumstances is another way
[Alberta's strong economy benefitted the rest Canada in recent
years.]{.underline} As important as any of these factors, however, is
**[Alberta\'s outsized contribution to the health of Canada\'s public
finances]{.underline}**. Thanks to high incomes, a youthful population,
and the fact the province does not receive equalization payments,
[Albertans send **much more money to the federal government** in taxes
and other forms of revenue than they receive back in transfer payments
and services. Even during the recent recession, this gap remained
large]{.underline}. In 2015, Albertans sent, on average, approximately
\$5,000 more to Ottawa then they received back in federal transfers and
services. Over the years, this large positive net contribution has added
up to truly staggering sums. [Between 2007 and 2015, Albertans sent
**\$221.4 billion** more to Ottawa than the province received back.
It\'s therefore difficult to overstate how important Alberta\'s
contribution has been to federal finances in recent years]{.underline}.
[If Alberta\'s net contribution per person were aligned with the
Canadian average]{.underline}, the federal government would **[never
have come close to balancing its budget at any point]{.underline}**
since the 2008-09 recession, [and the deficit today would be more than
\$20 billion larger than it actually is.]{.underline}

By any measure, **[Alberta is an energy
powerhouse]{.underline}**---[within Canada, but also on a global
scale]{.underline}. In 2023, [it produced 85 per cent of Canada's oil
and three-fifths of the country's natural gas.]{.underline} **[Most of
Canada's oil reserves are in Alberta]{.underline}**, along with a
majority of natural gas reserves. [Alberta is the beating heart of the
Canadian energy economy. And **energy, in turn, accounts for one-quarter
of Canada's international exports.**]{.underline} Consider some key
facts about the province's energy landscape, as noted in the Alberta
Energy Regulator's (AER) 2023 annual report. [Oil and natural gas
production continued to rise (on a volume basis) in 2023, on the heels
of steady increases over the preceding half decade]{.underline}.
However, the dollar value of Alberta's oil and gas production fell in
2023, as the surging prices recorded in 2022 following Russia's invasion
of Ukraine retreated. [Capital spending in the province's energy sector
reached \$30 billion in 2023, making it the leading driver of
private-sector investment]{.underline}. And completion of the Trans
Mountain pipeline expansion project has opened new offshore export
avenues for Canada's oil industry and should boost Alberta's energy
production and exports going forward. In a world striving to address
climate change, A[lberta's hydrocarbon-heavy energy sector faces
challenges]{.underline}. At some point, the world may start to consume
less oil and, later, less natural gas (in absolute terms). But such
"peak" consumption hasn't arrived yet, nor does it appear imminent.
While the demand for certain refined petroleum products is trending down
in some advanced economies, particularly in Europe, we should take a
broader global perspective when assessing energy demand and supply
trends. Looking at the worldwide picture, Goldman Sachs' 2024 global
energy forecast predicts that ["oil usage will increase through 2034"
thanks to strong demand in emerging markets and growing production of
petrochemicals that depend on oil]{.underline} as the principal
feedstock. [Global demand for natural gas (including LNG) will also
continue to increase]{.underline}, particularly since natural gas is the
least carbon-intensive fossil fuel and more of it is being traded in the
form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Against this backdrop, [there are
reasons to be optimistic about the prospects for Alberta's energy
sector]{.underline}, particularly if the federal government dials back
some of the economically destructive energy and climate policies adopted
by the last government. According to the AER's "base case" forecast,
[overall energy output will expand over the next 10 years]{.underline}.
Oilsands output is projected to grow modestly; natural gas production
will also rise, in part due to greater demand for Alberta's upstream gas
from LNG operators in British Columbia. The AER's forecast also points
to a positive trajectory for capital spending across the province's
energy sector. The agency sees annual investment rising from almost \$30
billion to \$40 billion by 2033. Most of this takes place in the oil and
gas industry, but "emerging" energy resources and projects aimed at
climate mitigation are expected to represent a bigger slice of
energy-related capital spending going forward. Like many other oil and
gas producing jurisdictions, Alberta must navigate the bumpy journey to
a lower-carbon future. [But the world is set to remain dependent on
fossil fuels for decades to come. This suggests the energy sector will
continue to underpin not only the Alberta economy but also Canada's
export portfolio for the foreseeable future]{.underline}.

Montreal, Canada -- In his first speech as Canada's prime
minister-designate, Mark Carney delivered what observers have described
as a stunning statement. "I know that these are dark days," Carney told
a room full of supporters on Sunday after he won the race to lead the
governing Liberal Party. "[Dark days brought on by a **country we can no
longer trust**."]{.underline} The country in question? [An ally with
which Canada shares the world's longest undefended land border and,
until recently, seemingly unshakeable ties: the United
States.]{.underline} "That is jaw-dropping in the broader context," Jon
Parmenter, a history professor at Cornell University in New York state,
said of Carney's remark. Experts say the idea that the US can no longer
be trusted reflects a sentiment that has been spreading rapidly across
Canada in recent months, however. In that time, Canadians have watched
with a mixture of shock, confusion and anger as US President Donald
Trump repeatedly took aim at their country --- both as part of his
global trade policies and his expansionist ambitions. Trump has imposed
steep tariffs on Canadian goods and threatened more. He regularly calls
for the annexation of Canada, and he has made unfounded and disparaging
claims about outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Canadian
electoral system. "The damage to the relationship is substantial,"
Parmenter told Al Jazeera. "It's going to be long-lasting." Yet, as
Trump's attacks against his country's northern neighbour continue
unabated, many observers are now asking: Why? Why is the president
targeting a country that had widely been viewed as one of the US's most
reliable partners? Why does Trump seem so fixated on Canada? 'Closest
target' While the [current US-Canada trade war is
"unprecedented"]{.underline} in modern history, it is unsurprising in
the context of Trump, according to Aaron Ettinger, a political science
professor at Carleton University in Ottawa. The US president pursued
similar "America First" economic policies during his first term,
Ettinger noted, including imposing tariffs on Canadian steel and
aluminium imports in 2018. "None of this is new. We know this is coming.
He's telegraphed everything. But now he's talking about 50-percent rates
of tariffs. [The aggressiveness is jacked up more than it was seven or
eight years ago]{.underline}," Ettinger told Al Jazeera. Within the
scope of the Trump administration's adversarial approach to foreign
policy, Ettinger said he doesn't believe Canada is particularly special.
Instead, it "just happens to be the closest target, along with Mexico".
"[Trump treats all countries as if they are subordinates to his
wishes]{.underline}. [He loves their leaders when the leaders play
along, and he doesn't when they don't]{.underline}," Ettinger said. "So
Canada is going to get hit with tariffs, just like European Union
countries and Mexico. Canada just happens to be close by. Canada also
happens to be playing against type and fighting back pretty hard right
now." The Canadian government has imposed retaliatory tariffs on
billions of dollars worth of American goods, further stoking Trump's
ire. It has said the measures will remain in place until the US
president rescinds and removes the threat of levies. Personal animosity
[Yet, Trump's focus on Canada goes beyond tariffs and economic policy
alone.]{.underline} Even before he re-entered the White House in
January, the [Republican leader began urging Canada to become the 51st
US state. He has repeatedly referred to **Trudeau as a "governor"
instead of a prime minister.** Trump also has framed the plan to **annex
Canada as a boon for Canadians** and a way to dodge US
tariffs.]{.underline} "The people would pay much less tax than they're
paying right now. They'd have perfect military protection," Trump
recently said. While Trudeau and other Canadian leaders at first
shrugged off the remarks as good-natured ribbing, they [quickly began to
take Trump's repeated calls for annexation more seriously]{.underline}.
Last week, [Trudeau told reporters that **Trump wants "a total collapse
of the Canadian economy because that'll make it easier to annex
us".**]{.underline} The outgoing prime minister said Canada will never
become part of the US and called the administration's tariffs a "very
dumb" policy. Trump and Trudeau never had a particularly warm
relationship, and they publicly clashed in 2018 over trade and tariffs
as well. That animosity could be playing a role in Trump's recent
rhetoric against Canada, said Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of
political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in
Washington, DC. "[Trump is always looking for a way to exact revenge and
retribution]{.underline} against people who have criticised him in the
past, and certainly Trudeau would fall into that category," he told Al
Jazeera. Trump and Trudeau shake hands at the G7 summit in France in
2019 Trump and Trudeau meet during the G7 summit in France in 2019
\[Carlos Barria/Reuters\] A '19th-century' vision But Kabaservice said
Trump's "very 19th-century idea" of what it means to be a great power is
at the heart of his annexation rhetoric. "When Trump talks about wanting
to 'Make America Great Again', [one component of what he has in mind by
greatness is a country that's expansive, that reaches for and claims new
territory, that enlarges itself,]{.underline}" he explained. That said,
when the US president says he wants Canada to be the 51st state, he
likely isn't thinking about what that would mean in practice, including
how [absorbing a country of 40 million people would alter American
politics,]{.underline} said Kabaservice. "It's sort of like just \[a\]
boy's fantasy: '[Wouldn't it be great if America could expand to take in
all these other countries? Wouldn't it be great if America was like
Britain back in its imperial days, when the world map was covered in
red]{.underline}?' "I think that's the level on which he thinks of these
things." And while [Trump's base may not have annexing Canada on its
list of priorities]{.underline}, Kabaservice said, the [US president's
supporters enjoy when he proposes things "that make his enemies and even
many of his allies unhappy".]{.underline} "[They applaud what they see
as his **audacity**]{.underline}, his **[willingness to envision a new
world]{.underline}**, and [his ability to 'own the libs' and make them
cry]{.underline}." According to Amy Koch, a Republican political
strategist, Trump's policies vis-a-vis Canada should also be seen as
part of a wider push for dominance in the Western hemisphere. Tariffs on
Canadian and Mexican goods, calls to retake control of the Panama Canal
and acquire Greenland, and an executive order renaming the Gulf of
Mexico the "Gulf of America" are all elements of that effort. "It is
\[about\] [fully establishing dominance in the Western Hemisphere, and I
think Canada is a part of that]{.underline}," Koch told Al Jazeera.
'Tactics without strategy' Wherever Trump's real motivation lies,
observers agree that **[his stance towards Canada could have a lasting
effect.]{.underline}** "[The whole point about Donald Trump is that he
is a bully, and bullies bully people who are susceptible to their
strengths. And that's what he's doing]{.underline}," said Kabaservice.
"Trump can do things like levy tariffs because he has the leverage over
Canada and he has the latitude in terms of the responsibility of the
chief executive ... But [we're also in the process of destroying trust
with our allies and that will be immensely difficult to
rebuild]{.underline}." Ettinger added that, while people in the US and
Canada keep trying to find the rationale behind Trump's actions, the
president may ultimately be "employing tactics without strategy". For
example, US stock markets plunged this week amid the uncertainty around
Trump's tariffs push, raising fears that the country could slip into a
recession. "[He knows that he wants to hit hard, or he wants to put
tariffs, or he wants to escalate]{.underline}. But there's no strategic
means-to-ends calculation going on here," Ettinger said. "And that makes
the guy fundamentally irrational."

After the harsh morning sunlight, the research center was dark and cool
inside. There, in front of a large monitor, an engineer clicked on a
slide to begin the day's presentation for his visitor: "Towards carbon
emissions net zero," it read. This was not, as the slide suggested, an
environmental organization or a climate conference. TIME had been
allowed inside the normally secretive R&D hub of
**[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Aramco, a fossil-fuel behemoth that
dwarfs giants like ExxonMobil and Chevron. **[Even as the [world's
largest oil exporter]{.mark} busily pumps crude and pours it into the
hulls of seafaring tankers, it is loudly [proclaiming]{.mark} its
[ambitions to reach]{.mark} [net-zero carbon emissions]{.mark} within
its borders [by 2060.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For Saudis---two-thirds of
whom are younger than 35---climate change is not a far-off issue. Summer
heat regularly tops 120°F. Climate scientists last year said they
believed the Middle East's temperatures could become "potentially
life-threatening for humans" in the years ahead. "These countries are
already facing a crisis," says Ali al-Saffar, an analyst on the region
at the International Energy Agency in Paris. "They have skin in the
game." The Saudis are hardly blameless for global warming;
environmentalists say Saudi Aramco has generated more than 4% of global
greenhouse gases since 1965. Here on the edge of the Arabian Desert,
Saudi Arabia has tapped an unfathomable quantity of oil---about 267
billion barrels of proven oil reserves, or about 15% of the world's
total---since the 1930s, when California wildcatters struck a gusher and
turned a tribal kingdom into a global oil power. More than 80 years on,
Saudi Arabia's domination in the oil world has scarcely diminished. It
pumps nearly 11 million barrels of oil a day---about 1 in every 10 in
the world---and sells more than 7 million of those on international
markets, earning vast riches for the ruling royals and their state-owned
company Aramco, whose profits rocketed to about \$110 billion last year.
And yet, after years of lucrative production, a global crisis now hangs
over the Saudis' prized position. Almost all countries have committed to
cutting their use of fossil fuels, by far the biggest source of the
planet's greenhouse gases. That could entail the most dramatic shift in
energy since the car age began more than a century ago. For [Saudi
Arabia, the question is [whether it can remain a super-power in the oil
world and]{.mark} at the same time [join the global climate
fight]{.mark}---[or]{.mark} whether its [ability to diversify]{.mark}
its [econ]{.mark}omy [away from]{.mark} an [overwhelming dependence on
oil will come too late, fall short]{.mark}, or otherwise prove itself to
be, as some charge, lip service to its critics.]{.underline} \[Image

[emerge]{.mark} from the global energy transition [as the world's
indispensablAe fossil-fuel power]{.mark}**---while **ironically
[boasting of a clean-energy, eco-friendly country at
home.]{.mark}**]{.underline} "They like to have their cake and eat it,"
says Jim Krane, energy geopolitics expert at Rice University in Houston.
"The Saudis' ambition is to be the last man standing in the global oil
market. They want the last drop of oil drilled to come from a Saudi
field." The **[[country has ample money for]{.mark} its grandiose
[plan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Aramco is now the second most valuable
company in the world (behind Apple), with a market cap of more than
\$2.3 trillion. With sharp price increases at the gas pumps, its
earnings have nearly doubled this year. The vast oil riches have given
the kingdom of just 35 million people enough clout to effectively
dictate quotas within OPEC, the international cartel of 13 major
oil-producing countries, with the potential to impact stock markets
across the world. That unique position could last for decades,
especially since the country's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman, or MBS, is just 37 years old, and could rule for
generations. "The **[[demand for oil]{.mark} will [continue
growing]{.mark}," Saudi Energy Minister]{.underline}** Prince Abdulaziz
bin Salman---the far older half-brother of MBS---tells TIME over tea in
his office in Riyadh. "At what level, I don't know," he says. "Anyone
who tells you that they have a good grasp of when and where and how much
is certainly living in a fantasyland." Last February, **[MBS transferred
[\$80 billion]{.mark} from the oil company [to]{.mark} the country's
sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, or
[PIF]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which he chairs. The [fund's assets have
risen sharply since the **pandemic** hit]{.underline}, to about \$620
billion, since [it **[bought into the lockdown dip to invest billions
in]{.mark}** Netflix, Carnival Cruises, Marriott hotels, California's EV
automaker Lucid Motors, and other **[stocks]{.mark},**]{.underline} when
they were pummeled by global lockdowns. Those **[[assets]{.mark} could
help [fund]{.mark} Saudi Arabia's own [energy
transition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just how that unfolds---how carbon
emissions are "handled," as Abdulaziz puts it---is what occupies
numerous top government engineers across the country. The efforts have
drawn some interest from Western investors, whose unease with the
kingdom's human-rights abuses has collided with business exigencies. On
the edge of Riyadh one crisp winter morning, in Saudi Arabia's King
Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, known by its acronym
KAPSARC, about 15 specialists gathered to outline the strategy for TIME.
Abdulaziz calls the researchers "my young cadets, none over 30." Many of
them are women, and many are U.S.-educated. **[[Among the plans]{.mark}
is a network of [EV charging stations]{.mark}, and a project to u[pgrade
offices and homes with low-energy electricity systems]{.mark}---[about
33 solar and wind projects]{.mark} are in construction.]{.underline}**
**[[Funding]{.mark} all this, they say, [is no
problem]{.mark},]{.underline}** if authorized by the royals. "**[We have
a [mandate from the King]{.mark}]{.underline}** to [make all buildings
retrofitted for energy efficiency]{.underline}," says Mudhyan
al-Mudhyan, of the National Energy Services Company. "[We have our own
capital to finance all our projects, so we don't need to go to banks or
any lending institutions."]{.underline} Perhaps the biggest experiment
under way is located in **[[NEOM]{.mark}, a [futuristic \$500 billion
city being built from scratch]{.mark} in the northwest of the
country.]{.underline}** In theory, it will become the **[[testing ground
for]{.mark} concepts like [air taxis]{.mark} and so-called [green
hydrogen]{.mark}, created by using renewable energy]{.underline}**, and
which MBS has boasted will generate most of NEOM's electricity. A
**[[green-fuel plant]{.mark} is being [built in NEOM,]{.mark} at a cost
of \$5 billion.]{.underline}** "It is a clear path towards moving from
the lab to the research center, to fully deployed technology," says
Sadad al-Husseini, a geologist who previously headed Aramco's
exploration and production department and who now heads Husseini Energy
Co., a forecasting and analysis consultancy in Aramco's hometown of
Dhahran. **[[Aramco's research includes]{.mark} trying to
[capture]{.mark} [and reuse]{.mark} the [carbon]{.mark} spewed into the
atmosphere [from Saudi oil fields]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It's a [tactic
Saudi Arabia is relying on heavily to meet its emissions
targets.]{.underline} Although its effectiveness is still deeply
uncertain, the Saudis have [begun capturing carbon, shipping it from a
gas field in the desert to a plant 52 miles away, to be turned into
petrochemicals.]{.underline} Engineers are also researching a way to
transport "blue" hydrogen---derived from natural gas---to far-off Europe
and Asia. Saudi Arabia -delivered the first shipment of blue ammonia to
Japan in 2020, for use in generating electricity, and has signed an
agreement with Germany to develop green hydrogen. **[[Aramco]{.mark} is
also [working on]{.mark} creating a [synthetic fuel from]{.mark} a mix
[of captured carbon and hydrogen]{.mark}, which it claims will
[cut]{.mark} the [pollution from]{.mark} regular [cars by
80%.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The company says it plans to start marketing
it in 2025. The fact that Saudi Arabia has only one oil company, and
that it's owned by the state, enables it to spend freely on research.
"You won't find Exxon or Chevron or any of these companies focusing
research on things like this," Husseini says. "If you say, 'Do a
research project that won't pay out for 20 years,' they would say,
'That's not our job.'" With an open spigot of cash to spend, the
engineers foresee creating new exports for the country, particularly of
hydrogen. "We can develop world-class engineering companies to design
hydro-carbon resources or plants in the kingdom, and also do that
service for anyone else who's interested," says Yehia Khoja, an
electrical engineer trained at Stanford University, who is an adviser to
the Energy Ministry. In a green Saudi Arabia, he says, the country would
cut its own fossil-fuel consumption by about 1 million barrels a day. It
could then sell that oil on world markets, and earn nearly \$100 million
a day, at current prices. "It is how we justify the economics of this
project," Khoja says. He calls the country's plan "holistic and
inclusive of all solutions. It is our way of trailblazing a path towards
a solution, rather than just being content in being part of a solution,"
he says. Climate scientists reject that argument, accusing Saudi Arabia
of greenwashing by declaring its commitment to carbon reductions while
aiming to increase oil production to 13 million barrels a day. Aramco's
carbon reduction does not include so-called Scope 3 emissions generated
by oil consumption, which scientists believe account for most
fossil-fuel greenhouse gases. "Aramco's approach to achieving emissions
reductions lacks credibility," Carbon Tracker Initiative, a financial
think tank based in London and New York City, said in a July report.
That is not just a problem for the planet. Oil-loving Saudi Arabia could
also one day face falling revenues from its energy company as the world
shifts to renewable energy. "Saudi Aramco is exacerbating, not
mitigating, its exposure to transition risk," the report says. Until
recently, it would have been unimaginable that Saudi Arabia could be
seen as a trailblazer in any global investments, let alone climate
mitigation---and indeed, many doubt it ever will be. Foreign investment
plunged after the October 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi
journalist living in Washington, who was killed and dismembered by Saudi
operatives in the country's consulate in Istanbul, his remains never
recovered. Last year, the CIA concluded that MBS had surely approved the
capture or murder of Khashoggi, given his "absolute control" over Saudi
security services. Amid the global outrage over the grisly
assassination, CEOs and Western officials boycotted that year's Future
Investment Initiative, MBS's flagship Davos-like gathering in Riyadh.
And yet, three years after Khashoggi's death, foreign investors were
back in Saudi Arabia in force, packing MBS's Saudi Green Initiative
conference last October, and drawn to the plethora of potential deals in
one of the biggest energy plans anywhere. As war raged in Ukraine, Saudi
officials invited top Wall Street investors to a New York City road show
in early April, to pitch their new city NEOM---a key element of the
country's green plans. For both investors and politicians, there's a
growing acceptance that the prince's tenure is likely to outlast almost
every world leader---one reason President Biden finally visited Riyadh
in July, even giving him a cozy fist bump. "The idea you're going to get
rid of MBS and replace him with the Canadian Parliament is naive in the
extreme," says David Rundell, a former longtime U.S. diplomat in Riyadh
and author of a book on the crown prince. "The alternative is al-Qaeda."
There is palpable relief on the ground that Khashoggi's death has had
little lasting business impact. "I think you could say we have moved
on," says Husseini, the longtime Aramco executive. "People may have
postured and said, 'Oh, I will never go there,'" he says. "But there are
fundamentals in the world. You have to maintain the economy moving."
That seems clear from the Saudi stock exchange, known as the Tadawul,
which is owned by the government through its sovereign wealth fund. Its
CEO, Khalid al-Hussan, estimates that about 14% of stocks are held by
non-Saudis, who purchase shares through about 2,600 institutional
investors trading on the exchange. When the Tadawul went partly public
last December, it was bombarded with requests for shares from foreign
investors, with subscriptions reaching 10 times the amount on offer,
according to Hussan. "I have met with more than 100 international
investors," he tells me on the day the applications closed. [**But for
[Saudis]{.mark} to keep attracting new investors**, they will
increasingly **[need companies]{.mark}** that (at least on paper) are
**[committed to tackling climate change]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "We see
this pressure in the U.S. and Europe more and more in the future,"
Hussan says. Environmental issues, he says, "will drive their investment
decisions." \[Image omitted\] Inside Aramco's R&D complex in Dhahran,
there is a strong belief that despite the climate crisis, it will not
only remain a huge oil giant but increase in size. **[[Aramco's
engineers argue]{.mark} that the [energy transition]{.mark} should
[focus on how to drill oil more cleanly]{.mark}, rather than cutting the
amount of oil pumped. The company's [researchers]{.mark} say they are
already [working with automakers]{.mark}]{.underline}** (which they
declined to name) **[[to switch to hydrogen-powered
engines]{.underline}]{.mark}**; a Nissan sedan fitted with a
green-hydrogen engine sits parked outside the front door as an example.
A short drive away is the company's new center for artificial
intelligence, dubbed the 4IR (fourth industrial revolution) building.
One display shows mangrove plantations Aramco has planted near its huge
Ras Tanura refinery on the Arabian Gulf; vegetation acts as a natural
system of carbon capture, extracting emissions from the air and
absorbing them in the swampy ground. But the heart of the 4IR building
is a large circular control room resembling NASA's ground control in
Houston. There, [**[engineers monitor every drop of oil Aramco
pumps]{.mark}** across hundreds of oil fields, with **60 drones and a
fleet of robots sucking up 5 billion data points in real time**. A
screen wraps around the walls, showing a blizzard of graphs and
figures---**information engineers say they can use to [analyze how to
keep producing oil while cutting emissions.]{.mark}** "It is all about
efficiency and sustainability," one says, guiding me through the
center.]{.underline} To environmentalists, Aramco's efforts seem like
the last gasp of an oil giant attempting to keep the global climate
campaign at bay. "Aramco has no plans to reduce oil and gas production
by 2030," says ClientEarth, an international environmental legal
organization. The government, it says, "has a long history of fighting
efforts to tackle climate change." [**[Energy analysts say]{.mark} the
[Saudi]{.mark}s**---who since the 1930s have drilled oil more cheaply
than anyone else---**are [well positioned to find solutions to]{.mark}
the [climate crisis]{.mark}, and [put them into
effect]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "[**They have built a lot of know-how and
a [lot of capacity.]{.mark}** They have the pipeline infrastructure, the
ports infrastructure,"]{.underline} says Saffar of the International
Energy Agency. The country now needs to end its overwhelming dependence
on oil revenues and transition to more clean energy---a tough two-headed
challenge, Saffar says. "If you could make them work in the same
direction, you would be really onto something," he says. The question is
whether Saudi Arabia's rulers have the will to do so, even at the risk
of their outsize profits.

Scene Setting For the **[[Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark}, the
[energy-climate dilemma is causing a shift in
strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Oil-producing countries along the
Persian Gulf are at the epicenter of the energy transition, but its slow
pace suggests difficult times in coming decades rather than in the next
year or two. Economic risks from softening oil demand loom largest, but
others --- including the potential reduction in strategic importance to
Washington and rebalancing of domestic social contracts --- add further
exposures. On the plus side, the **[region holds attributes that give it
an edge in cleaning up emissions]{.underline}**. But it remains to be
seen how assiduously regimes in the Middle East will pursue
decarbonization. The tensions are fundamental. The countries lining the
Persian Gulf host the greatest and most accessible quantities of oil and
gas resources in the world. Successful development has rendered Gulf
economies and governance systems intensely reliant on energy revenues.
On average, **[70% of government budgets and 30% of GDP arise from oil
and gas exports, although those figures vary greatly by country and
year.\[1\]]{.underline}** The Gulf region is also on the leading edge of
changes in the climate. The heatwave of 2016 sent temperatures in Kuwait
and Iraq to 129.2 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius), the
highest-ever reading in the eastern hemisphere.\[2\] Further warming in
one of the world's hottest regions means that global decarbonization
must be prioritized to maintain livability. Emissions from the Gulf
countries are substantial, even in comparison with major economies. On a
per capita basis, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries emit more
than the United States (Figures 1 and 2). Gulf societies have developed
energy intensive lifestyles over the past five decades based on cheap
--- generally subsidized --- fuels and energy services. Relative to GDP,
the world's top subsidizers of fossil fuels are mainly in the Gulf, led
by Iran. The effects on demand have been stunning. Saudi Arabia ranks
No. 41 by population, but is the world's No. 4 oil consumer, surpassing
Japan, Russia, Brazil and Germany (Figure 3). Consumer subsidies are
notoriously difficult to retract. Gulf governments managed partial
reforms starting in 2014, which began to moderate oil demand, but growth
returned in 2021 as COVID-19 pandemic effects dissipated. \[Figures
omitted\] Alongside these challenges, the already sharp tempo of
geopolitical crisis formation in Middle East has surged to brink levels
in the past year. Wars focused on Israel and its occupied territories
have bled into neighboring countries and sea lanes. Shipping costs and
travel durations for the Gulf's export-oriented economies have rendered
their products less competitive in some markets, particularly liquified
natural gas (LNG) bound for Europe. Longer term, the transition away
from fossil fuels suggests a downgrade in the region's strategic
importance to the developed world. In short, the Gulf region is the
world's key hydrocarbon supplier and reserves holder, a major consumer
and subsidizer of fossil fuels, an early victim of the changing climate,
and a global hub of armed conflict. As such it remains difficult to
envision successful intervention on greenhouse gas emissions without
concerted action by major Gulf governments, such as Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), and even Iran. As such, it is highly likely
that global interest in the Gulf's energy-climate travails will only
increase. Of course, with challenges come opportunities, and **[[Gulf
countries harbor big advantages that could render them ideal
destinations for investment in energy transition
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\[3\] These [include [copious solar
radiation]{.mark} and [vacant land]{.mark}, along with
[carbon-sequestering attributes]{.mark}, such as [clustered emissions
next to geological storage sites]{.mark}, and [expertise and investment
capital targeting hydrogen]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Buildouts of
renewable power generation and low-carbon hydrogen production]{.mark},
along with [carbon capture and storage capacity]{.mark}, are in the
nascent stages in the Gulf.]{.underline} **[A [concerted push]{.mark}
--- if it happens --- could [diversify a preeminent oil supply region
into a preeminent carbon management region.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
Road Ahead Crafting workable policies to deal with the Gulf's transition
dilemma will [require international support.]{.underline} In recognition
of this and to ensure a voice at the table, Gulf policymakers have
openly joined deliberations around the international climate agenda. For
nearly 20 years, Gulf governments have pledged to build out renewable
power and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. Early pledges
were based around ambitious goals in solar and nuclear power generation.
Later, further commitments were enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement
and the subsequent announcements of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 by
the UAE and Oman or 2060 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain. The
evolution of stated goals, aspiration, and reality in the Middle East is
characterized by a few targets being hit, but most targets being missed,
with new targets being announced. For instance, did Abu Dhabi reach its
2008 goal that 7% of its power generating capacity be provided by
renewable sources by 2020? Yes, it did. Did Saudi Arabia build the 23.9
gigawatts of solar generation capacity it promised by 2020? No, it did
not.\[4\] **[[Strategies are evolving and include a variety of
technologies.]{.mark}]{.underline}** An Example in the Making? **[[Saudi
Aramco's Hydrogen Strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}** Middle East
governments often assign climate policy to their energy ministries and,
if they have one, national oil companies. Saudi Aramco, the world's
largest oil producing and exporting firm, is a linchpin of Saudi climate
strategy. Due to its world-leading carbon production, particularly the
so-called Scope 3 emissions from global combustion of Saudi oil,
**[[Aramco]{.mark} holds significant influence in the world's climate
ambitions and agenda]{.underline}**, just as decisions made in consuming
countries will impact Saudi Arabia's export revenue. [**One of the
[decarbonization pathways]{.mark}** that Saudi Aramco has touted
involves **[swapping conventional fuels for low-carbon
replacements]{.mark},** many of which revolve around
hydrogen]{.underline}. **[[Hydrogen]{.mark} has emerged as a [favored
energy carrier]{.mark} given the prospects for [avoid]{.mark}ing
[g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as emissions while [retaining a
familiar business model for fuel supply chains]{.mark} that
[leverages]{.mark} the [resource comparative advantages native to the
region.]{.mark} [Aramco's ambitions on hydrogen]{.mark} are shaping up
as an [important variable in energy transition]{.mark}s and are an
indicator that Saudi Aramco's remit is broadening from carbon extraction
and distribution to full-cycle carbon management.]{.underline}**\[5\]
[[Aramco's engineering and investment capacity]{.mark} aims to
[convert]{.mark} the [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [into]{.mark} an [investment
destination for climate‑compliant industrial production]{.mark}. This
will be achieved by **[decarbonizing existing assets]{.mark} ---
electrifying processes [using renewables]{.mark} --- and [providing
services in carbon removal, conversion, utilization, and
sequestration]{.mark}.**]{.underline} We Cannot Forget the Centrality of
Geopolitics The Red Sea as a Harbinger of Future Stress? Geopolitics
remains central to any discussion of the Middle East, especially given
the region's makeup of small states with clashing national interests and
relations. Most recently, Yemen's Houthi movement stands out in this
regard. The Houthi attacks on global shipping through the Red Sea, for
example, has negatively impacted trade in energy commodities, with LNG
carriers at the top of the list of cargo types. The Houthi attacks
present a new phenomenon in geo-economic conflict.\[6\] A quasi-state
group is using asymmetric tactics and weaponry not just to fight
conventional armed forces, but to selectively thwart shipping in ways
that serve as targeted economic sanctions against countries supporting
Israel. The Iran-backed Houthi can do this by dint of access to
inexpensive innovations in weaponry in combination with control of
strategic territory astride one of the world's great maritime
chokepoints: the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. As of late June 2024, the Houthi
challenge to free and secure navigation remains unresolved.
International military and diplomatic efforts have failed to halt the
attacks, and the Houthi have proven resilient to attempts at deterrence.
Regardless of how much longer this goes on, it raises an obvious
question about whether the Red Sea shipping conundrum is a one-off or
whether it is replicable elsewhere by others inspired by the Houthis'
unorthodox tactics. Declining Strategic Importance? The global oil
market may be evolving in ways that could undermine the strategic
importance of oil-producing countries, at least in the eyes of the U.S.
government. The market is being reshaped by electric and more efficient
mobility, broadening geographic diversity of oil production, especially
from the U.S., and a rising share of oil being diverted to petrochemical
use. These trends suggest U.S. voters and future U.S. administrations
will be less directly exposed to price swings and other risks in the
global oil market, and less reliant on Saudi Arabia for price stability.
Why is this significant? Diminishing risk exposure could reduce the
imperatives for U.S. policymakers to spend so heavily on security
provision in the Persian Gulf --- more than \$100 billion per year ---
or to resolve diplomatic rifts with major producers such as Saudi
Arabia.\[7\] Moreover, it can be argued that the general shift in
pressures on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) cartel --- from Russia becoming an active participant in
negotiating production quotas to speculation regarding the UAE's
membership --- emanate from diverging responses to energy
transitions.\[8\] This, in turn, raises questions about the long-term
strategic importance of OPEC and its members, at least from the
perspective of developed countries such as the U.S. That stated, the
strategic importance of the Gulf region in the climate equation is
increasing. **[The [Gulf's cooperation]{.mark} is a [prerequisite for
any workable climate action]{.mark}, and the [region's carbon management
advantages and capital investment capabilities]{.mark} make it an
[attractive partner for future climate actions.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
While these attributes are unlikely to fully offset the negatives from a
decline in oil rents and loss of oil's monopoly as a transportation
fuel, they provide promising pathways for Gulf leadership. Final Remarks
Under any imaginable scenario, climate change and energy transitions
pose a difficult future for the Gulf region. In addition to undermining
all-important oil rents --- the political lifeblood of these monarchical
regimes --- these trends threaten the protection and diplomatic support
of key allies, the survivability of the Gulf climate, and even the
social contract between governments and society. The stakes could not be
higher.

2 Executive Summary

[Transition [risks]{.mark}]{.underline} for petrostates [[are **higher**
than **ever**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

This report, an update of our 2021 Beyond Petrostates report, finds that
[petrostates are facing **substantial risks** from the energy
**transition**, as falling]{.underline} oil and gas [**demand** is set
to put downward pressure on commodity **prices** and place
future]{.underline} government [revenues in **jeopardy**]{.underline}.

While a small handful of countries have reduced their vulnerability,
overall the 40 petrostates we analyse are just as vulnerable as in our
original analysis and in many ways face growing risks.

Petrostates face major shortfalls in future revenue streams.

28 of the 40 petrostates would lose more than half of expected revenue
under a moderate-paced transition (vertical axis, Figure 1), in line
with governments' current climate pledges (represented by the IEA's APS
scenario). \$8 trillion worth of expected revenue would be wiped out
between now and 2040, with different petrostates affected in
significantly different ways.

We categorise countries' vulnerability into five tiers, reflecting the
combination of their revenue shortfall and the dependence of government
budgets on oil and gas revenues (Figure 1). TimorLeste and Venezuela are
found to be the most vulnerable but African petrostates -- including
Nigeria, Angola and Chad -- make up the majority of the "highest tier"
countries. This is particularly concerning given the continent's rapidly
growing populations and existing development challenges, exacerbated by
rising climate impacts. While some petrostates appear low-risk according
to our two key metrics, they may still be vulnerable in a wider economic
context, as indicated by high fiscal breakeven prices.

[[**No** producer is **safe**]{.mark} from declining demand]{.underline}
for oil and gas.

While the highest-cost producers face the largest revenue losses per
barrel, the **[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}**est-[[**cost**
producers]{.underline}]{.mark} -- such as those [in the **Mid**dle
**East**]{.underline} -- would [[also lose]{.mark} significant
**revenue** [under]{.mark} the [**moderate-paced** transition]{.mark}
scenario]{.underline} compared to any expectations under a slow
transition.

Although oil and gas exporting countries in Europe and North America
have relatively low dependence on hydrocarbons for government revenue --
and are not, therefore, considered petrostates -- their higher
production costs mean they face greater relative losses from the
transition.

[**Peaking** oil and gas **demand** should make petrostates **think
twice**]{.underline} about new investments.

[The **I**]{.underline}nternational **[E]{.underline}**nergy
**[A]{.underline}**gency's latest World Energy Outlook [predicts
**[demand]{.mark}** for oil, gas]{.underline}, and coal [[will]{.mark}
all [**peak** by]{.mark} the [end of]{.mark} this [**decade** thanks
to]{.mark} the falling costs of **[clean tech]{.mark}**nologies, **[even
if no additional]{.mark} climate [policies]{.mark}** [are
introduced]{.mark}]{.underline}. While current high [**inflation** and
**interest rates**]{.underline} have interrupted the downward trend in
these falling costs, this [is likely to be a **temporary** setback in
sustained **long-term** trajectories.]{.underline}

[The **[increasing]{.mark}** economic competitiveness of **[clean
tech]{.mark}**nologies [has given governments]{.mark}]{.underline}
(mainly in the Global North) [the [**confidence** to]{.mark} announce
future **[ban]{.mark}**s on the [sale of]{.mark} new **petrol** and
diesel [vehicles]{.mark}]{.underline} and gas boilers, **[[wiping
out]{.underline}]{.mark}** a substantial proportion of [fossil fuel
**[demand]{.mark}** permanently]{.underline}.

There is growing momentum around COP28 for governments to agree on a
target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 and a doubling of
energy efficiency measures, setting a clear direction of travel.

Recent events have highlighted the need to cut dependence on volatile
imports.

Since our original Beyond Petrostates report, the world has been rocked
by a number of geopolitical events with significant implications for
global energy supplies -- most notably [Russia's invasion of
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} but, more recently, [[conflict
in]{.mark} the **[Mid]{.mark}**dle **[East]{.mark}**. Many
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly the G7 and European Union,
have [[accelerated efforts to cut **dependence**]{.mark} on fossil fuel
imports [in **response**]{.mark}. This further threatens petrostates'
**customer base**]{.underline} in the coming decades.

There is a growing global consensus to curb fossil fuel use.

While fossil fuels have largely been a taboo subject at UN climate
summits, [[the **tide** has]{.mark} now [begun]{.mark} to
**turn**]{.underline}. The final agreement at COP26 in 2021 included
language on fossil fuels for the first time -- specifically a
"phasedown" of unabated coal power and a phaseout of inefficient fossil
fuel subsidies. The COP also saw the launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas
Alliance, which aims to facilitate the managed phase-out of oil and gas
production, and recently welcomed its first petrostate -- Colombia -- as
a "friend".

[[Emerging petrostates are **setting up**]{.mark} their [industries

#### It's not a plateau, it's a cliff edge. 

**Bond 22**, Senior Principal at RMI with the strategy team, M.A. in
History from Cambridge University (Kingsmill Bond, March 31, 2022, "How
Putin's War Marks the End of the Fossil Fuel Era," RMI,
https://rmi.org/how-putins-war-marks-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era/)

[Russia's invasion of [**Ukraine** means]{.mark} that global
**[demand]{.mark}** for fossil fuels [has]{.mark} very likely [peaked
--- **for good**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The world's policymakers have
been working toward this tipping point for years. And now, the twin
forces of national security and energy economics are driving permanent
system change away from fossil fuels quicker than ever.

This framing is directly contrary to the perspective of most fossil fuel
industry participants. Their hope is that energy scarcity and high
fossil fuel prices will kill the energy transition. On one level this is
a basic error of economics: after all, higher prices for anything --
including fossil fuels --- mean lower demand. But it is also a failure
to realize that the world has changed since earlier oil shocks. Today,
the alternative energy solutions are large enough to supply demand
growth and do so at a lower cost.

From Plateau to Cliff

The math behind peaking demand for fossil fuels is not complex. If we
take BP data for the decade to 2020, global energy demand has grown at 1
percent per year. Solar and wind supply grew at an average rate of 20
percent per year over the decade and made up around 4.4 percent of
primary energy supply in 2021. A year of even 15 percent growth would
see them make up 0.66 percentage points of the growth in total energy
supply.

In other words, under a steady-state environment, solar and wind are
meeting about two thirds of the growth in energy demand. Added output
from hydro, nuclear, and biomass supply is enough to make up the rest of
the demand growth. This leaves very little room for incremental demand
for fossil fuels.

[The impact of [COVID]{.mark} has **[muddied]{.mark}** the
[waters]{.mark}]{.underline} by introducing a cyclical crash and
recovery, [[but]{.mark} the [**structural** shift is
**clear**]{.mark}]{.underline}. BP's Accelerated Transition scenario
illustrates the story below. Fossil fuel demand reaches a peak in 2019,
moves along a plateau for a few years, and then falls off a cliff in the
second half of the decade.

[However, Putin's [war will turn]{.mark} this **bumpy [plateau]{.mark}**
[into a **cliff edge**]{.mark}. If]{.underline} we assume for the sake
of argument that [**efficiency** increases by 1 percentage point and
[**solar** and **wind**]{.mark} growth **increases** by 5
percentage]{.underline} points to 20 percent, [then the [**decline**
in]{.mark} fossil fuel **[demand]{.mark}** would [turn **into a rout**.
Fossil]{.mark} fuel **[demand]{.mark}** would [fall]{.mark} by 25
percent [this decade and]{.mark} then [**collapse** in]{.mark} the
**[2030s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

As the world's largest exporter of fossil fuels, [[Russia sits on the
**fault lines** of this]{.mark} shift]{.underline}. Its largest customer
is Europe. [Rising [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} between the two [[will
**inevitably**]{.mark} mean]{.underline} a long period of uncertainty
and [**[stress]{.mark}** for [fossil]{.mark} fuel **[markets]{.mark}**,
a reckoning [which will **galvanize**]{.mark} the energy
**[transition]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The risk of energy security today is a more powerful driver for world
leaders than the future of the planet in 30 years. Converging dynamics
--- a surge in petrol prices and Russian tanks on the borders --- are
forcing politicians to make choices once deemed impossible. Within a
month, Germany has changed decades of policy toward Russia and brought
forward its energy transition by over a decade. The latest plan to
replace Russian gas with green hydrogen from Australia is just the start
of a new approach to manufacture energy rather than extract it.

Europe shows that there are solutions that will drive radical change by
2030: more renewable supply, more electrification, and greater
efficiency. The European Commission has published plans to increase the
deployment of solar panels and wind turbines to 900 GW, deploy 50
million electric heat pumps, quadruple hydrogen supply, and rapidly
electrify industry.

[To achieve these goals, we [will **inevitably** see]{.mark} the
**resolution** of many of the outstanding barriers]{.underline} to
change: **[[faster]{.underline}]{.mark}** renewable
[**[permitting]{.mark}**, better market]{.underline}-based electricity
[**systems**, [and]{.mark} faster [grid
**deployment**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Tipping Point after Tipping Point

Stressed supply chains also mean high prices for fossil fuels. And
fossil fuels compete with new energy solutions in every sector. For the
past decade one tipping point after another has been reached as
renewables undercut fossil fuels on price.

[A sustained **surge** in fossil fuel **prices** brings forward **all**
those tipping points]{.underline}. For example, "green" ammonia for
fertilizer production and other uses was not expected to be cheaper than
fossil ammonia until the end of the decade. But given the sharp spike in
natural gas prices, that green ammonia and green hydrogen are cheaper
today than fossil fuel-based sources. [Before the war, [**solar** and
**wind**]{.mark} sources of electricity were **cheaper** than fossil
fuels in 85 percent of the world. At **today's** fossil fuel **prices**,
they [are]{.mark} now [cheaper]{.mark} almost
**[everywhere]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Relatively low prices unleash the giant potential of renewables. Solar
and wind potential is over 100 times the amount of energy that fossil
fuels provide us. They are local, they are clean, and they are cheap.
They solve the energy trilemma --- the struggle to balance
decarbonization, energy security and affordability --- and release
countries from energy dependency.

[It is **not just Europe**]{.underline} that will change. [High
**prices** create the **pressure** for change
**everywhere**]{.underline}. While 10 percent of the world lives in
petrostates, 80 percent of people live in fossil fuel importers. As
Europe scours the world looking for liquefied natural gas (LNG), so it
drives up prices in Asia. As Europe suffers the threat that fossil fuel
supply is cut off, so every other energy importer fears that they too
could one day fall out with their fossil fuel supplier.

#### Petrostate collapse now: even moderate renewable transition kicks out the high-cost producers first.

"[Electricity is]{.underline} expanding to become [the **basis** of our
entire **energy** system, driven by [**falling costs** of wind,
solar]{.mark}]{.underline} and batteries," said Guy Prince, senior oil
and gas analyst at Carbon Tracker and author of the report, in a press
statement. "[This [is a]{.mark} profound [**threat** to oil]{.mark} and
gas **exporting** [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}, because [[falling
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} for oil and gas [is likely to [**lead** to
a]{.mark} significant [**fall** in]{.mark} future
**[revenues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Governments should waste no time in
reducing their dependence on fossil fuel revenues and take steps to make
their economies more resilient and better equipped for a low-carbon
future."

[Demand]{.underline} for oil and gas [is expected to start **declining**
before the end of the **decade**, with]{.underline} the subsequent
[oversupply likely to result in **falling prices**]{.underline}. This,
the report warns, [will leave a **large hole** in]{.underline} the
public finances of the world's **[petrostates]{.underline}**, even those
with the lowest cost of production, hampering their ability to fund
public services and [[threatening]{.mark} their
**[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The 'Petrostates of Decline' report, released on 1 December, analyses
the potential fossil-fuel revenues of 40 oil and gas dependent countries
between 2023 and 2040 [[in]{.mark} the scenario of a **[moderately
paced]{.mark}** energy [transition]{.mark}]{.underline} that limits
global warming to 1.8°C. The nations' [[revenues **will fall**]{.mark}
from]{.underline} an expected \$17trn to just \$9trn, the research
found.

"In many petrostates, a political settlement has become established
where citizens expect high public sector salaries and low or zero-income
taxes along with a generous welfare state," said Prince. "Restructuring
their economies is likely to require parallel political reforms to make
lawmakers more accountable and give citizens greater representation."

[[Governments are adopting]{.mark} increasingly [**tough** climate
**policies**]{.mark} as natural disasters **proliferate**]{.underline}
and intensify, and the global carbon budget -- the amount of carbon that
can be safely emitted for the world to stay within a 50% chance of
limiting global warming to 1.5°C -- looks likely to be blown before the
decade's end.

As [COP28]{.underline} kicked off in Dubai, nearly [[**120** countries
backed]{.mark} a goal to **triple [renewables]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
double energy efficiency [by 2030]{.underline}. Language calling for a
"phasedown/out" of "fossil fuels" and "coal" -- with negotiators still
to decide on the final wording -- was also included in a first draft
text circulated at the COP. Some are pushing for a Fossil Fuel
Non-Proliferation Treaty.

[The [ever-**decreasing cost**]{.mark} of renewable energies and
**e**lectric **v**ehicle**s**, [along with]{.mark} the energy
**security** concerns]{.underline} spotlighted [by the
**[Ukraine]{.mark}** War, [is diminishing **demand** for oil]{.mark} and
gas]{.underline}. According to the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023,
demand for oil will fall from 100 million barrels a day (b/d) in 2019 to
92.5 million b/d in 2030 and 54.5 million b/d in 2050 if current
national policy pledges are fulfilled.

Carbon Tracker warns that a country like the UAE relies on oil and
gas for 40% of government income, but faces a 60% drop in production
revenue. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is in a similar
situation. [In **[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Nigeria, Angola, Chad,
Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon all [[rely on **oil**]{.mark} and gas
[for]{.mark} **over [60%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} their total
**[budgets]{.mark}**]{.underline}; and all but Gabon face a 70%
reduction in expected oil and gas revenues. [[Venezuela
is]{.underline}]{.mark} the country most **[[at
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with its public finances entirely
[dependent on oil and gas revenues]{.underline}, which could be over 80%
lower than forecast.

Petrostate governments earn fossil fuel revenues either through
state-owned national oil companies (NOCs) or through taxing oil and gas
production. But when demand falls, declining prices reduce these
revenues and can render some projects uneconomic. [The [**highest cost**
producers]{.mark} will **[suffer]{.mark}** the most]{.underline}, and a
moderate transition is likely to make redundant over 50% of new projects
belonging to NOCs Rosneft (Russia), Ecopetrol (Colombia; this became the
tenth government to join the call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation
Treaty on 2 December) and Pemex (Mexico).

However, price slumps will impact all petrostates. Countries in the
Middle East and North Africa will see 45% less oil and gas revenues
under a moderate transition than a slow one, [with nations [in **Latin
America**]{.mark}, the [**Caribbean** and **Africa**]{.mark} suffering
even more.]{.underline}

[[Petrostates]{.mark} also **[face]{.mark}** other [threats to]{.mark}
their **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including rising national
debt levels, fast growing populations, uneven levels of development and
fragile political institutions. Central bank debt in the 33 petrostates
the IMF has consistent data on doubled on average from 24% in 2010 to
46% in 2018. And Africa's population, for example, is set to double to
2.5bn by 2050. "Clearly, such rapidly growing populations in oil and gas
revenue dependent states, that are relatively less developed, is a
dangerous combination in a future of declining oil and gas demand," said
Prince.

[The **[transition]{.mark}** of]{.underline} our global
[energy]{.underline} system [[is
**unstoppable**\...]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Electricity is]{.underline} expanding to become [the **basis** of our
entire **energy** system, driven by [**falling** costs of **wind** and
**solar**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, [these cost reductions
[**cannot** be reversed]{.mark}]{.underline}: the new technologies and
means of industrial production cannot be "unlearned".

Incumbent firms can seek to slow down the process of transition by
sponsoring innovation in their own technologies. This is known as the
"sailing ship effect", after the period in the mid-nineteenth century
which saw a dramatic increase in sailing ship innovation, slowing their
replacement with steamships by a few decades. [Saudi
**[Aramco]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for instance, [has
**[doubled]{.mark}** its [spending]{.mark} on **research**]{.underline}
and development [in the last five years]{.underline}, with a particular
focus [[on]{.mark} the [**efficiency** of **i**]{.mark}nternal
**[c]{.mark}**ombustion **[e]{.mark}**ngine[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. 10
[Whilst [this is]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly [in the **interest** of
those firms, it is **[not]{.mark}** an **[efficient]{.mark}** use of
capital]{.underline} from a societal or investor perspective, [since [it
is simply **delaying**]{.mark} **an [inevitable]{.mark}**
[transition]{.mark}, whereas **innovation** funds would be **better
spent** on the **new tech**nologies.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, [once **demand**]{.mark}]{.underline} for a commodity or
product [[has **peaked**]{.mark}, self-reinforcing [**feedback loops**
drive]{.mark} the [market into **decline**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bond et
al, 2022). For example, [investors exit]{.underline} the sector, driving
up the cost of capital and worsening the incumbent's competitive
position against the newcomer.

\...Increasing the need for a managed phaseout strategy from oil and gas
investments.

Faced with a future of declining demand for fossil fuel products, oil
and gas producers -- be they private companies or NOCs -- must factor in
the likely impact of lower demand and commodity pricing on future
revenues when assessing the viability of new developments. By
approaching the inevitable decline in oil and gas demand with an
appropriate strategy, such as allowing natural depletion,
diversification into new businesses, or a managed investment approach
focussing on short-cycle projects, companies can reduce their risk
exposure and serve the best interests of their shareholders. See our
recent report, Navigating Peak Demand, for analysis and discussion on
the strategies available to oil and gas companies.

[[Reliance on high **oil prices**]{.mark} for fiscal sustainability
[presents a **major challenge**]{.mark} for petrostates]{.underline}.

[Most [producers are **ill-prepared** for the]{.mark} coming [**peak**.
In **all**]{.mark} of the [petrostates]{.mark}]{.underline} featured in
this report, [**oil** and **gas** account for a material
share]{.underline} of government revenues; in over half of them, the
share is [**above 30%**. [If]{.mark} oil [prices **fall**,]{.mark} these
[governments]{.mark} will [**struggle** to balance]{.mark} their

### UQ\-\--Canada\-\--2AC

#### Canada [recession now]{.underline}\-\--trade [uncertainty]{.underline}. 

**Rana 3-21**, writer at MSN, citing Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank
of Canada (Uday Rana, March 21, 2025, "Canada's economy managed a soft
landing. That might not last, warns Macklem," MSN,
https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/canada-s-economy-managed-a-soft-landing-that-might-not-last-warns-macklem/ar-AA1Bkw3Y)

Speaking at an event in Calgary, Macklem said that while
[[the **Canadian econ**]{.underline}]{.mark}omy entered 2025 on a
[strong footing]{.underline} after years of COVID-19 disruptions and
inflation, the [[outlook]{.underline}]{.mark} for the year [[is **not
rosy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[\"The Canadian **econ**]{.underline}omy [managed a **soft
landing**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [**we're not** going to stay on
the tarmac **for long**]{.underline},\" he said.

Macklem said Trump's first term in office created uncertainty in the
relatively stable trading relationship between the U.S. and Canada.
However, his second term is causing far more.

\"After more than 50 years of high predictability in trade policy, there
was a sharp increase in uncertainty during President Trump's first term
in office. But that uncertainty doesn't come close to what we see now,\"
he said.

Macklem said depending on the duration of the
**[[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the [impact [could be]{.mark}
"**[severe]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline}  adding that [the uncertainty is
[**already** harming **business**]{.mark} investment **in
Canada**.]{.underline}

He also raised concerns over threats to Canada's sovereignty.

"Most disturbing of all for Canadians, President [Trump]{.underline} has
threatened our sovereignty, [repeatedly referring **to Canada** as the
**51st state**]{.underline}. There can be no question about our
sovereignty or our border," he said.

Macklem said the [[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} around tariffs
[[makes it **difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark} for Canadians [**[to
plan]{.mark}** for the future]{.underline}.

\"Unfortunately, [the **[uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline} we face
[[may]{.mark} last a while]{.underline}. That will [[make it
**difficult**]{.mark} for]{.underline} Canadian [businesses
to]{.underline} figure out their best strategy and hard for Canadian
families [[**to plan** for]{.mark} the [future]{.mark}]{.underline}," he
said.

However, Macklem added that the Canadian economy entering 2025 looking
strong puts Canada in a good position to meet the challenge.

"Five years after the pandemic hit, we have come through an
unprecedented global crisis and restored economic growth and low
inflation. Interest rates have come down substantially. Because of that,
we are in a better position to confront the risks ahead," he said.

Macklem said the agriculture sector in the Prairie provinces and the
manufacturing sector in Ontario and Quebec will take a big hit from
Trump's tariffs. He said [[Canada's **energy**]{.mark}
sector]{.underline}, which sends 94 per cent [of]{.underline} its crude
[oil]{.underline} exports to the U.S., [[will be]{.underline}]{.mark}
among [the **[worst-hit]{.mark}**]{.underline} industries. "Looking
ahead, [U.S. [tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline} could [[put]{.mark} downward
[**pressure** on]{.mark}]{.underline} Canadian [energy [**prices** and
reduce]{.mark} the [**profitability** of]{.mark} Canadian energy
**[producers]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- at least until access to other
markets can be expanded. [The **[hit to profits]{.mark}** combined
[with]{.mark} the [**uncertainty** means]{.mark} that [investment
**will**]{.mark} likely **[drop]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and employment
could follow," he said.

Macklem said [Alberta will **feel the pinch**, along with
**refineries**]{.underline} in midwestern U.S. states.

"I know Albertans have lived through **[boom-and-bust]{.underline}**
commodity [cycles]{.underline} for generations. But [a **threat**
to]{.underline} the [Canada]{.underline}-U.S. [energy]{.underline}
relationship is not something we've ever had to contemplate," he said.

### UQ\-\--Canada\-\--1AR

#### Growth crashes now: [consumer sentiment]{.underline}, [stocks]{.underline}, policy [uncertainty]{.underline}, [stagflation]{.underline}, and [isolationism]{.underline}. 

**Authers 3-31**, senior editor at Bloomberg, BA in Economics from
Oxford (John Authers, March 31, 2025, "Beware the End of March\... Or
Lose Your Ventures," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-03-31/first-quarter-beware-the-end-of-march-or-lose-your-ventures)

[Noise **isn't abating**. We now know]{.underline} that President Donald
[Trump is considering **oil [sanctions]{.mark}** [on
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}; that [he thinks he can [run for **a third
term**]{.mark}]{.underline}; that [he "**couldn't care** less" if
**[tariffs]{.mark}** mean **higher**]{.underline} imported car
**[prices]{.underline}**; and that a big block of [new tariffs will be
**announced**]{.underline} Wednesday, Liberation Day. [[It's **hard to
know**]{.mark} which way to look]{.underline}. Here's a guide to what
we've learned so far, what we know, and what we still need to ask.

The Fault Is Not in Our Stars... But in Ourselves

Or, [[the]{.mark} post-election **[rally is
over]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Relative to MSCI's index for all world
stock markets outside the US, [the MSCI **[US
index]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- to all intents and purposes [identical
to the **S&P 500** --- [is]{.mark} on course for [its **worst quarter**
since]{.mark} at least **[23 years]{.mark}**. The tide is **flooding**
--- in the wrong direction]{.underline}. A bad Monday would make it the
worst quarter for the US since the index's inception. [Only]{.underline}
the second quarter of **[2002]{.underline}**, which produced the
shocking corporate governance scandals at [WorldCom]{.underline} and
Tyco, [saw the **US lag**]{.underline} the rest of the world by
[**more**. This is an **epic change**]{.underline} of judgment on where
the US will go from here. It would be absurd not to attribute this in
large part to Trump:

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

As Constant as the North Star

Or, no new trend has replaced US exceptionalism. Note that all the worst
quarters for the US above were followed by periods of outperformance. We
can't extrapolate the massive shift in sentiment that we've just
witnessed into the future. Breaking the risk-on "Trump Trade" into three
of its key elements --- US stocks relative to the rest of the world, the
Magnificent Seven stocks relative to everyone else in the US, and US
stocks versus Treasuries --- all are only slightly lower than they were
on Election Day. This is a big shift, but it's done little more than
cancel out a prior shift in the opposite direction. On such a full sea
we're now afloat:

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

What Means This Shouting?

Or, [**['soft']{.mark}** survey **[data]{.mark}** have
[tanked]{.mark}]{.underline}, but hard data aren't so clear. George
Soros' concept of reflexivity holds that in markets and the economy,
[[perceptions]{.mark} can **[change reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That
means [the **spectacular shift** in **[consumer sentiment]{.mark}**
needs to be treated with respect. **Consumers** in the US [are braced
for]{.mark} **a return** to [serious **inflation**]{.mark}. They're
**more** convinced of this than at **any time** in four
**decades**]{.underline}, even though the average self-identified
Republican still expects inflation to tick down to zero:

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

Bracing for **[[8% inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}** is on the face of it
irrational. Many things need to go wrong before we get back to levels
like that. But Soros' dictum suggests [we should **[take it
seriously]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also, [the [bond **market**
is]{.mark}]{.underline} also growing more
[[concerned]{.underline}]{.mark} that [inflation is **coming
back**]{.underline}. Break-evens imply that [[inflation will **top
3%**]{.mark} over the next **two years**]{.underline}. Forecasts are
their [highest since]{.underline} a brief spike around [the
**S**]{.underline}ilicon **[V]{.underline}**alley **[B]{.underline}**ank
[crisis two years ago. [The **inflation** narrative]{.mark} is falling
**out of control**, and [could be
**self-fulfilling**]{.mark}:]{.underline}

What a Terrible Era in Which Idiots Govern the Blind

Or, the real sea change has been in US foreign policy. Many elements of
the Trump 2.0 agenda were well-signposted. But the extent of the US
shift on foreign policy, [[siding with **Russia**]{.mark}
in]{.underline} a United Nations vote on [**Ukraine**,
[threatening]{.mark}]{.underline} the annexation of [[**Canada**
and **Greenland**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and pouring [[**scorn**
on]{.mark} the **[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion, took most everyone by surprise.
Forceful moves to get NATO allies to spend more on defense were
expected; rhetoric so aggressive that those allies are rearming on the
assumption that the US is no longer an ally is something very different.
That has already triggered a remarkable shift in German fiscal
policy --- a rare example of a time when mere words (most significantly
in Vice President JD Vance's speech in Munich and then the humiliation
of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the Oval Office) have had
instant massive economic effects.

[This is a deliberate **move away** from an international
**order**]{.underline} that has served the US well. When world hegemonic
powers withdraw, they generally do so because they have no choice (such
as Ancient Rome, or Britain a century ago). Their [**[economies
suffer]{.mark} greatly** as a result. [If people **no longer
trust**]{.mark} the [US, they won't **continue**]{.mark} the inflows of
**[investment]{.mark}** that have kept the stock **market high** and
**inflation**]{.underline} and interest rates **[low]{.underline}**.

#### Winning US recession causes recession in every other country too.

University, former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia (Stephen Roach, March
31, 2025, "A World Turned Inside Out," China-US Focus,

[The **[Trump]{.mark} shock**]{.underline}, in short, [[is]{.mark} the
functional **equivalent** of [a **full-blown crisis**]{.mark}. It is
likely to [have a **lasting impact**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the US and
Chinese economies, [[and]{.mark} the **[contagion is]{.mark}** almost
[**certain to spread** throughout the **world** through]{.mark}
cross-border [**trade** and **capital flows**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Perhaps most importantly, this is a geostrategic crisis, reflecting [a
**reversal** of America's global **leadership**]{.underline} role. In
the space of little more than two months, Trump has [turned the world
**inside out**]{.underline}. If my assessment of this shock is anywhere
close to the mark, [concerns over the global economic **forecast** seem
almost **trivial**. ]{.underline}

#### Foreign economies get crushed too if the US goes under.

tariffs might miss their No. 1 target," Market Watch,
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-might-miss-their-no-1-target-5d4b6340)

But [[if]{.mark} the [U.S. **enters a recession**]{.mark} because
investment **stalls** under **uncertainty**]{.underline} and real wages
get depressed by tariffs and a weaker labor market, [[then
**foreign**]{.mark} **export**]{.underline}-heavy [[**economies** would
**be crushed**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Germany's manufacturing sector
already struggling to compete with China, and the U.K. economy is
essentially dealing with stagflation. The European Central Bank and the
Bank of England have less room to cut interest rates than the Fed does,
and fiscally Europe is more frugal (notwithstanding the recent
infrastructure funding announcements).

economy particularly vulnerable due to its high reliance on exports.
\"[[The **shelf life** of economic forecasts is]{.mark} now

senior economist and director of economics at BMO Economics. He further
notes that [[**uncertainty alone** is]{.mark} affecting investment

However [[given]{.mark} the [**uncertainty** around

[A surprise decision by **OPEC**]{.underline}+ [to boost oil output

[[Investors are reacting to a **double-whammy**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[To make matters worse, **[OPEC]{.mark}**]{.underline}+ announced that

### UQ\-\--Warming Turns\-\--2AC

#### Warming decimates Canada's economy.

University in Ontario, \*\*Sean, PhD in finance from the University of
Toronto, Professor of Finance at Queen's University. (Neal, May 18,
2022, "Canada faces huge physical costs from climate change, making net
zero a great investment," Queen's Gazette,

There has been a lot of discussion in Canada lately about the financial
costs of achieving the country's climate targets. And rightly so. [[The
situation is **urgent**]{.underline}]{.mark} and we need to act now.

Fighting climate change will require a concerted effort, affecting all
sectors of the economy. And while there will be great economic
opportunity and lots of new jobs in the green economy, there will be
considerable disruptions in the workforce, major economic challenges and
significant capital investment required.

However, we in the finance business like to look at both sides of the
ledger. And [when one considers the damage]{.underline} to the Canadian
economy [we can expect from [fires, floods, melting ice
caps]{.mark}]{.underline} and loss of biodiversity due to climate
change, the investment in greenhouse gas reductions starts to look very
worthwhile indeed.

Climate change impacts economic prosperity

In a new study we recently published with the Institute for Sustainable
Finance, we posit that economic value is sacrificed every day that
action is not taken to mitigate the economic and ecological risks posed
by climate change. Existing economic models agree that losses are
unavoidable without change and investment. But questions remained
regarding how much value will be lost and how quickly.

Our study modelled the physical risk to Canada, or how much capital
output might be lost, over various warming scenarios between now and the
end of the century. We found that [under a business-as-usual
scenario]{.underline}, with no new international greenhouse gas
mitigation measures taken, allowing the climate to warm 5 C by 2100,
[[the cumulative cost]{.mark} to Canada [would be **\$5.5
trillion**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

That's a big number. And it's a lot higher than the damage we would see
[under a scenario [where]{.mark} global [warming is kept to 2
C]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[we estimate]{.mark} to be [around
**\$2.8 trillion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Of course, this is just the financial cost and [does not take into
account the suffering of those who will lose livelihoods, homes and
businesses]{.underline}, or even their lives, due to climate-related
disasters.

Our study further reveals that the [[associated costs of physical damage
are **larger** than the investments required to reduce
g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as
emission[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, the difference is up to \$45.4
billion larger than the required investment. And this doesn't even
consider the potential economic benefits of transitioning to a
low-carbon economy.

Yes, it is true that Canada can't fight climate change on its own, and
that it's a global effort. But the incentive is clear for a rich,
developed, industrialized country like Canada to take a global
leadership role and meet our own net-zero targets.

Quick action is crucial

There is also a big incentive to act now, as we will face some
inflection points in the coming decades that will make the challenge
considerably more difficult.

Our study found that the costs of climate change damage are expected to
grow gradually until 2050, around which time there is a sharp increase
under all scenarios. By 2070 there is an exponential increase in
damages. These dates correspond to two of the significant target dates
for achieving net zero noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change in its reports.

Despite the recent increased attention to addressing climate change,
progress has been too slow. It is becoming clear that we are not on
pace to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 C above
pre-industrial levels by 2100. Estimates from the IPCC and others
suggest that with current progress, and if the world meets its existing
commitments, we are more on pace for a 3 C warming scenario. There is a
very real risk that warming will be higher still.

This is all bad news for [[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is
**highly susceptible** to the impacts]{.mark}]{.underline} of climate
change [[and is warming at **twice the rate** of the global
average]{.underline}]{.mark}. But until now, we haven't had an effective
assessment of the physical risks and the potential capital cost to
Canada.

[We have much to lose]{.underline}. And it should now be clear that
tackling climate change more than pays for itself in terms of avoided
physical damage alone.![The

#### The costs compound over time and reducing emissions solves.

Climate Institute,
https://climateinstitute.ca/the-gdp-costs-of-climate-change-for-canada/)

Our new research shows that [the [macroeconomic
costs]{.mark}]{.underline} of climate change [[are **already
big**]{.mark} and are poised to get **even larger**]{.underline} over
time. It's these cumulative effects that make it particularly hard to
get a handle on the full scale of potential damages. [We aren't talking
about periodic shocks]{.underline} that undermine growth in any one
year: [[climate change will be a drag]{.mark} on growth
[in every year]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, unless we take policy action,
those costs are going to add-up in a serious way. 

Modelling the costs of climate change

Damage Control is the culmination of the Canadian Climate Institute's
Costs of Climate Change series, a multi-year modelling and research
project that aims to better understand and quantify the potential costs
of a changing climate in Canada. The analysis integrates two global
greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, downscaled projections from seven
different global climate models, and two adaptation scenarios in a
macroeconomic model of Canada's economy. All told, our analysis
simulates 84 scenarios to bound a wide range of uncertainty. 

The upshot? [The costs of climate change for Canada are already
big]{.underline}---and they are growing. 

Climate damages mean lower GDP 

Those economic damages aren't in some far-off future. Our analysis
suggests that [[by 2025]{.underline}]{.mark}, the previous 10 years of
climate change will have shaved \$25 billion off of national GDP. In
other words, [[the]{.mark} Canadian econ[omy will be **\$25
billion**]{.mark} dollars [smaller]{.mark} than it would have been if
global warming had stabilized in 2015]{.underline}.The economy still
grows at a fast clip, but the cumulative drag adds up.  

That's a big number. To break it down, \$25 billion [[represents **half
a year** of growth]{.mark} in the Canadian economy]{.underline}, \$630
per person of lost national income, is equivalent to more than twice the
cost of the November 2021 floods that ravaged British Columbia, and is
12 times larger than all insured losses from weather-related disasters
in Canada in 2021. 

It's also just the beginning. Critically \$25 billion dollars isn't just
the result of climate shocks---storms, floods, fires, and more---in
2025. It represents the accumulation of impacts from each subsequent
year. Our modelling simulation starts in 2015. Each year, climate
impacts mean that GDP is lower than it would have otherwise been, and it
grows a little bit more slowly than it otherwise would have. 

That means that [the [costs]{.mark}]{.underline} of climate change
[effectively [**compound** over time]{.mark}]{.underline}. The drag on
the economy from climate impacts will accumulate even more in the
longer-term, as the figure below illustrates. [By 2030, GDP will be \$35
billion lower]{.underline} than it would have otherwise been---[[by
2055, it will be]{.underline}]{.mark} \$80 to [[\$**103 billion
lower**]{.underline}]{.mark}.  

The true costs of climate change for Canadians will be even larger

The [GDP]{.underline} impacts of a changing climate in Damage
Control convey the urgency of the climate crisis for Canada. Yet even
these large [impacts tell only part of the story.]{.underline} 

GDP masks some of the more acute impacts. It's not just the total
damages to the economy that matters, it's also who pays for those
damages. In our modelling, [governments **backstop** the impacts of
climate change]{.underline} by helping to rebuild damaged infrastructure
and assets, paying for increased healthcare costs, and fixing damages
from weather-related disasters. [That [diverts capital from activities
that would]{.mark} actually [drive **additional
growth**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than rebuilding what we already
have. But it also means that taxpayers ultimately bear the brunt of
climate impacts. 

Our analysis finds that [all households will lose income]{.underline},
and low-income households will suffer the most. Low-income households
could see income losses of 12 per cent in a low-emissions scenario and
23 per cent in a high-emissions scenario by the end of the century.  

Furthermore, our results only represent the "tip of the iceberg" when it
comes to the full range of effects to Canada's economy and society from
a changing climate. There remain many below-the-waterline risks, where
climate change will likely generate even greater economic impacts, but
that have too much uncertainty and complexity to quantify at this
stage. 

The long-term impacts of climate change aren't yet written in stone

The economic stakes of climate change for Canada are high. Yet our
analysis is fundamentally a warning, not a prediction: action now can
still avert the highest costs. 

Adaption---action that reduces the negative impacts of climate change
like building seawalls and strengthening bridges and hydro lines---pays
off big. Every dollar spent on adaptation measures saves \$13-\$15,
including both direct and indirect economy-wide benefits. Taking
proactive adaptation measures cuts climate costs in half. That means
that Canada's forthcoming National Adaptation Strategy is a hugely
important policy opportunity for Canada to begin the steps to prepare
for climate change and seize those very large potential savings.  

At the same time, [[limiting]{.mark} further
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}, while also adapting to the warming
already baked in, [[pays off **bigger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Combining
proactive adaptation in Canada with global progress in [[reducing
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} [[could reduce the
costs]{.underline}]{.mark} of climate change for Canada [[by
**three-quarters**]{.underline}]{.mark}. \
Canada  is making progress. But the lessons from Damage Control are
clear: [[maximizing economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}---and the
prosperity for Canadians that comes with it---[[requires taking climate
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} (both adaptation and mitigation) much more
**[[seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Climate Inaction Costs Lives... and Billions 

We're [[**already** feeling the effects]{.mark}]{.underline} of climate
inactions [[across Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The financial toll
from]{.underline} [this year's two biggest]{.underline} extreme weather
[disasters has already surpassed \$1.8 billion]{.underline} in insured
losses alone. [[A **single afternoon** of heavy
rain]{.underline}]{.mark} in Toronto this July [[caused flooding
that]{.underline}]{.mark} winded up
[[cost]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [almost **[\$1
billion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while the
[[wildfire]{.underline}]{.mark} that ravaged parts of Jasper, the ninth
costliest natural disaster in Canada's history, [[will cost at
least \$880 million]{.underline}]{.mark} in insured losses. 

[These numbers only account for insured losses]{.underline}. [The real
cost]{.underline} of climate disasters -- to marginalized indigenous
communities, people's livelihoods, and ecosystems -- [is
**incalculable**]{.underline}. And, as always, those suffering the most
from climate impacts are people living in poverty, particularly women
and children, who have contributed the least to the crisis. Yet, despite
these devastating losses, funding provided to date to help communities
adapt to climate impacts falls dangerously short. The [[U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations]{.underline} Environment Programme (UNEP) [[estimates
that **\$387 billion** a year is required for climate adaptation
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}, but current funding is nowhere near that

### I/L\-\--High Prices\-\--War\-\--AT: Oil DA\-\--2AC

#### High prices cause war and instability: petrol-aggression.

**Ashford 22**, Adjunct Professor of Security Studies at Georgetown
University, Ph.D., Foreign Affairs, University of Virginia, M.A.,

Being a Petrostate," Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/19/petrostates-oil-production-weapon-foreign-policy-war-economy/)

Cicero, perhaps apocryphally, is said to have written that ["endless
money forms the sinews of war." **War** and **wealth** are intrinsically
**linked**]{.underline}. A nation's ability to wage war is inherently
dependent on its ability to raise and fund armed forces.

Oil-wealthy states---defined here as those that earn more than \$1,000
per capita in oil and natural gas revenues each year---hold vast, easily
obtained wealth that makes them almost uniquely capable of waging war
without sacrificing domestic priorities. Due to high levels of income
from oil and gas production, they can afford to build up military
capacity, buy weapons, increase military salaries, or engage in research
and development, all without substantial budgetary trade-offs. To put it
another way: If they wish, [[leaders in **oil**]{.mark}-wealthy
**[states]{.mark}** can [have guns **and** butter]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Oil-wealthy states are a diverse bunch, [[including **Russia**]{.mark},
small and large **[Mid]{.mark}**dle **[East]{.mark}**ern
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} (Qatar, Iran), several wealthy democracies
(Norway, Australia), [[and]{.mark} various]{.underline} underdeveloped
[[**African** and]{.mark} Central [**Asian**
nations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Turkmenistan).
Yet although they face a diverse set of national security challenges,
[most **share** common **trends** in their military **expenditures**:
[As oil **prices rise**, so does military **spending**. When]{.mark} oil
**[prices crash]{.mark}**, military [spending]{.mark} eventually
**[drops]{.mark}**. Cross-national **[stat]{.mark}**istical
analysi[**s** confirm]{.mark}]{.underline}s that [oil-wealthy states
**spend more**]{.underline} on their militaries on an absolute basis,
[regardless of **regime type** or major-**power status**.]{.underline}

Likewise, data on arms sales shows a strong correlation between oil
wealth and weapons purchases. According to a metric from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, although wealthy oil states are
a relatively small proportion of all states globally, they have been
well represented among top arms importers, both during the Cold War and
after. Global arms sales have largely risen in line with oil prices in
recent decades.

Of course, there are other ways to transform money into military
capacity, notably in the research and development of advanced
technologies. The most controversial investment in technological
research is the development of a nuclear weapons program. Data on
nuclear programs and nuclear latency reveals that [[oil]{.mark}
**wealth** [is]{.mark} strongly [correlated with]{.mark}]{.underline}
nuclear development, with oil-wealthy states on average more likely to
have [an [active **nuclear**]{.mark} program or]{.underline} to have
[the **latent** nuclear **[capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessary to
build one quickly.

Interestingly, oil wealth is not correlated with higher spending as a
percentage of government expenditure. In plain English, this means that
oil-rich and oil-poor states appear to spend comparable chunks of their
overall budgets on their militaries. If the state budget is a pie, then
oil-wealthy states simply have a much larger pie, with the government
spending more overall.

And while oil-wealthy states may spend more on their militaries, that
doesn't necessarily mean they have more combat capability to show for
it. Arms must be chosen wisely to meet key threats, and troops must be
trained on new weapon systems to use them effectively. Spending a lot on
prestige weapon systems---fighter jets or the latest in high-tech
gadgets---may look impressive but yield little military advantage.

Politically difficult changes in strategy, doctrine, or force structure
may be necessary to improve military effectiveness, even with higher
levels of spending. This is particularly the case in countries with high
levels of corruption and underdeveloped institutions---maladies common
in oil-wealthy states. Indeed, we've seen many of these flaws on public
display in recent months in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Despite
billions poured into Russia's military modernization over the last
decade, the military has performed abysmally.

Even well-implemented military spending doesn't always yield battlefield
effectiveness. For authoritarian regimes, battlefield effectiveness may
be impeded by other regime priorities such as coup-proofing. Consider
Saddam Hussein's Iraq, where efforts at coup-proofing against his army
resulted in poor performance and near disaster during the early years of
the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. Any army that prioritizes domestic
policing and repression is not necessarily an effective fighting force
against peer competitors.

As in any state, therefore, military expenditure must be coupled with
effective management and strategic doctrine to produce a capable force.
What military expenditure does offer, mainly, is potential---the
potential to substantially improve military capability if it is spent
wisely.

The more difficult question is whether increased military expenditure
itself makes a state more likely to initiate conflicts. One could argue
that oil wealth doesn't cause war but merely facilitates it.

Yet [**[excessive]{.mark}** military [**spending** could easily
increase]{.mark} the risk of **[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
connection is simple: [Having [a]{.mark} well-equipped and
**well-[funded]{.mark}** [military gives leaders]{.mark} **more
[confidence]{.mark}** in their ability [to win]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These [leaders can assume]{.underline}, perhaps wrongly, that [they have
**assembled** a superior fighting force]{.underline}. Baathist Iraq---a
particularly belligerent petrostate---provides an illustration of this:
Saddam's conviction in his own military genius, his faith in new
armaments, and his belief that his troops performed well (despite all
evidence) often led him to conflicts he could not win. Libya's Muammar
al-Qaddafi made similar mistakes.

This offers one potential explanation for [[oil]{.mark}-wealthy
[states']{.mark}]{.underline} tendency toward conflict: Their
[[**overconfident** leaders]{.mark} mistake **high** military
**spending** for actual capability]{.underline}. It also suggests an
unfortunate corollary: [Oil-wealthy states]{.underline} not only [[are
**more likely** to start wars]{.underline}]{.mark} but may be more
likely to lose them. Oil wealth may even cushion the negative impact of
losing a war, [providing ways [to **buy off**]{.mark}]{.underline}
segments of [[society and]{.mark} allowing a leader to **[maintain
power]{.mark}** despite]{.underline} repeated **[conflict]{.underline}**
losses.

Data, estimation, and results

[[This **study** builds on]{.underline}]{.mark} replications of
**[Colgan]{.underline}** (2010) [and **Weeks**]{.underline} (2012). The
former is a monadic8 analysis of the effects [of oil exporter
status]{.underline} on MIDs. The latter is a directeddyadic9 analysis of
MID initiation. The Colgan replication is conducted on a sample
comprising 153 states for the period 1947--2001; coverage of the
variables restricts the analysis to 6014 country-years. The Weeks
replication is conducted on a sample of 25,953 directed dyads for the
period 1947--1998; coverage of the variables restricts the analysis to a
maximum of [**[728,226]{.mark}** directed
[dyad-**years**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the Weeks study did not
originally investigate the effects of oil prices on dispute behavior, it
is a very highly cited and well-respected recent contribution to the
quantitative empirical literature on MID initiation.

For the Colgan reanalysis, the dependent variable is the country-year
count of MIDs. Behaviorally, MIDs range from relatively minor acts, such
as or including troop incursions into disputed territory and firing
warning shots, and attacks resulting in fatalities. [This is considered
[the most **comprehensive**]{.mark} and widely used **[data]{.mark}
source** [on]{.mark} interstate **[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Tests for two operationalizations are presented: total MIDs,
irrespective of which state instigated, and instigated MIDs, those in
which the country in question is the initiator (i.e. took the first
action). The mean for MIDs is 0.5, with at least one MID occurring in
roughly 25% of country-years, and with a maximum value of 26 (Iran in
1987). The mean for instigated MIDs is 0.24, with at least one MID
instigated in 10% of country-years, with a maximum of 23 (Iran in 1987).
For the Weeks reanalysis, the dependent variable is whether or not
country A initiated a MID against country B in a given year. Initiated
MIDs are quite rare, with initiated MIDs occurring in 0.18% of directed
dyad-years.

The main independent variable is the real price of oil per barrel (West
Texas Intermediate, or WTI) in constant 2008 dollars; data are from
Hamilton (2009).10 WTI, along with Brent Blend and Dubai/Oman, is one of
the three major benchmarks against which crude contracts are pegged.11
Table 1 presents prices by decade for the period under study
(1947--2001). Oil prices ranged from a low of US\$17.54 per barrel in
1947 to a high of US\$96.72 per barrel in 1980. Average prices were
highest in the 1980s, when oil traded at prices 157% higher than the
average of the 1960s. The relative standard deviation (RSD, s/m)
indicates that while prices were higher on average in the 1980s, prices
were more volatile in the 1970s, the decade characterized by two OPEC
embargos. This stands in contrast to the 1950s and 1960s, a period
characterized by comparatively low prices and very low price volatility.

To test for conditional effects, the price variable is interacted with
several variables drawn from Colgan (2010). Petrostate is a dummy coding
that takes a value of one if revenues from net oil exports constitute at
least 10% of GDP, and zero otherwise. Petrostates account for 11.6% of
country-years and 13% of directed dyad-years in the samples, with 11
states meeting this threshold for the entire time period.12

Revolutionary leader is a dummy coding for whether the head of state was
a revolutionary leader or not. Colgan's definition of a revolutionary
leader has two components. The first component involves the means by
which the ruler comes in to office: ''First, has the individual leader
used armed force against his own state at any time prior to coming to
office as an integral part of coming to national influence, and
ultimately, state leadership? Second, were there mass demonstrations or
uprisings, violent or non-violent, that were instrumental in deciding
the outcome of the transition?'' (Colgan, 2012: 444--445). The second
component refers to the types of policies the leader implemented while
in office: ''Did the leader usher in a major change to the constitution?
Did the leader adopt communism or fascism as the official ideology of
the state/ruling party? Did the leader overhaul rules governing property
ownership?'' (Colgan, 2012: 445). Revolutionary leaders are present in
13.8% of country-years in the sample, with Russia/Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (82%), Cuba (81%), Albania (79%), Serbia/Yugoslavia
(78%), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (76%) having the largest
proportion of time spent under revolutionary governments. For a complete
list of revolutionary leaders, see Colgan (2012).

Various controls are included as well. In the Colgan reanalysis, (ln)
population size and (ln) GDP per capita are included. Larger states have
engaged in more disputes, while the effect of GDP per capita is
theoretically ambiguous: wealthier states tend to have more resources to
invest in military capacity, but this would affect both their ability to
project force and their ability to deter attempts to use force against
them. Since major powers tend to be more involved in international
disputes than even their population size and level of development would
suggest, a control for major power status is included, as is a control
for democracy. While pairs of democracies are much less likely to fight
(Oneal and Russett, 1997), the theoretical effect of democracy in the
monadic sense is less well established. However, it is important to
include it as a control, since oil exporters tend to be more autocratic
than non-oil-exporting countries (Anderson and Ross, 2014; Ross, 2001).
Democracy is operationalized using the revised combined Polity score, a
21-point scale ranging from 10 (strong democracies) to 210 (strong
autocracies) (Marshall and Jaggers, 2009). Finally, controls for
temporal dependence---peace years, or a count of years since a country's
last MID, and its squared and cubed terms---are included as well.13 All
specifications include panel fixed effects and clustered standard
errors.14 All independent variables are lagged one time period to
address concerns about the endogeneity of prices to conflict behavior, a
relationship that will be probed further in robustness checks. Because
the dependent variable is a count variable, negative binomial and
Poisson regression are used.

In the Weeks reanalysis, the controls include indicator variables for a
variety of authoritarian regime types (machines, juntas, bosses and
strongmen; see Weeks (2012) for a description), measures of military
capabilities, derived from the Correlates of War operationalizations
thereof, for both states, major and minor power status, and peace years
and its squared and cubic terms.15 As the outcome is binary, logistic
regression is used. Specifications include either directed dyad random
effects or fixed effects as indicated.16 Random and fixed effects
represent two alternatives for addressing otherwise unmodeled attributes
of directed dyads that affect the baseline propensity for conflict
initiation.

Table 2 presents results for the Colgan reanalysis; the odd-numbered
models correspond to MID onsets and the even-numbered to instigated
MIDs. Interaction terms complicate interpretation of coefficients, since
levels of statistical significance are conditional on the mediating
variable taking on a value of zero (Braumoeller, 2004). The dummy
specifications of petrostate and revolutionary leadership, however,
simplify interpretation. The coefficient on oil price represents the
effect of oil prices on non-petrostate, non-revolutionary leader-led
countries, while the coefficients on the petrostate and revolutionary
leader represent the effect of these factors on MIDs and instigated MIDs
when oil prices are zero---the effect necessarily varies across observed
values of the interacted variable. To assess the impact of oil prices in
petrostates and under revolutionary leaders, one must calculate the
conditional slope as an additive function of the coefficients on oil
price and the interaction terms.

The results provide support for H1. [[**Higher** oil prices]{.mark} are
associated with an **[increase]{.mark}**d frequency of [**MID onsets**
in petrostates]{.mark}]{.underline}, but not in non-petrostates. All
things being equal, a [[one]{.mark} **standard
[deviation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (US\$18.60) [[increase in]{.mark} the
**[price]{.mark} of oil**]{.underline} per barrel from the sample mean
(US\$33.81) [[is]{.mark} associated with [a **13%** increase in]{.mark}
the frequency of **[MIDs]{.mark}**]{.underline} (model 2.1). Phrased in
Friedman's terms, [petrostates are roughly **30%** more **likely** to be
involved in **disputes** when oil prices are at US**\$60** per barrel
**than** when they are at US**\$20** per barrel]{.underline}. No such
relationship is found for non-petrostates, providing support for H4.
Confirming the results of Colgan's earlier analysis, however, the
confluence of petrostate status and revolutionary leadership is
associated with significantly more bellicose behavior, and this finding
is not price contingent: the petrostate 3 revolutionary leader
interaction term is positive and significant in all four specifications,
while the oil price 3 petrostate 3 revolutionary leader interaction term
is not statistically significant in all four specifications and the
confidence intervals for revolutionary-led petrostates are so large as
to be statistically indistinguishable from the other categories
(non-petrostates and petrostates). Given that revolutionary-led
petrostates are still petrostates, however, their dispute propensity
increases as prices increase, although the proportional effects are
smaller given the higher baseline incidence of MIDs.

The [monadic [**results** indicate]{.mark} that the
**[bellicosity]{.mark}** of petrostates]{.underline} relative to
non-petrostates [[is **price-contingent**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Figure 3
plots predicted counts of MIDs for revolutionary-led petrostates,
petrostates without revolutionary leaders, and non-petrostates across a
range of values for oil prices. Above US\$70 per barrel, petrostates are
significantly more dispute-prone than non-petrostates: although the
confidence intervals overlap, two-sample t-tests confirm that the
estimated counts of MIDs for petrotates and non-petrostates are
significant at and above US\$70 per barrel.17 Below US\$30 per barrel,
petrostates are less dispute-prone than non-petrostates, although the
finding is not statistically significant. Revolutionary-led petrostates
are the most dispute-prone across all oil prices, although the finding
is statistically insignificant above US\$70 per barrel.

Cause or Lubricant? Military Expenditure and Conflict

Perhaps a more challenging question is whether wealth and military
expenditure can itself make states more likely to initiate conflicts.
Certainly, there is a clear and compelling case to be made that [[oil
wealth **smooths**]{.mark} the conduct of [**war**, making it
**cheaper**]{.mark} and **easier** for petrostates [to sustain
**conflict**]{.mark}, pay [**troops**, and buy]{.mark}]{.underline}
replacement [**[arm]{.mark}**ament**[s]{.mark}**. Oil [wealth]{.mark}
undoubtedly **[lowers]{.mark}** the [**barriers** to conflict]{.mark} by
making it **more affordable** and **less costly** for
states]{.underline}, at least in monetary terms. But it is an altogether
different thing to argue that oil wealth actually makes states more
prone to start conflicts; this is the reason prior studies have focused
on other factors---such as the personality foibles of revolutionary
leaders---to explain why oil-rich states end up in wars so often.69 Is
oil wealth merely a lubricant for states already interested in war, or
is it an actual cause of those conflicts? Or to put it another way, does
oil wealth cause war, or does it merely facilitate it? 70

While this chapter has primarily focused on the facilitating effects of
oil wealth---in effect, increased military expenditure---it is worth
pointing out that even within purely rationalist models of conflict
initiation, excessive military spending could easily increase the risk
of conflict. The connection is simple: having a well-equipped and funded
military increases the attractiveness of military options to leaders,
leading them to be more confident of their ability to win a conflict. In
short, when deciding whether to enter a conflict, leaders weigh the
potential risks of losing against the possible benefits of winning.
Since waging (and losing) war is costly, states try to generate an
assessment of the likelihood of winning or losing before they enter the
conflict, considering such factors as available resources, public (or
private) support for a war, and perceptions about an opponent\'s
strength and resolve. Theoretically, this means wars should be rare. But
misperceptions and overconfidence are also present.71 As Stephen Van
Evera has famously observed, \"At least some false optimism about
relative power preceded every major war since 1740, as well as many
lesser and ancient wars.\" 72 [**Oil-wealthy** states\' excessive
military **spending** can increase the **overconfidence** of their
leaders, who see **expensive** weapons and extensive **military
outlays** and assume they have]{.underline} assembled [a **superior**
fighting **force** capable of achieving **victory** at a **low
cost**.]{.underline}

Ba\'athist Iraq---a particularly belligerent case---provides an excel-
lent illustration of this process. Saddam Hussein\'s conviction in his
own military genius, his faith in new armaments, and his belief that his
troops performed well (despite all evidence) often led him to seek
no-win conflicts.73 His decision to launch a war with Iran in 1980 was
based on a series of misperceptions, assuming his own army was strong
and well armed while his enemy was weak. Hussein had initiated a major
military expansion effort\" during the late 1970s, making his army the
second-largest in the Middle East, provisioned with top-of- the-line
weapons. Yet as Caitlin Talmadge succinctly points out, \"Lack of
material capability was not the primary Iraqi problem in fighting
Iran.\"74 Hussein overestimated the potential performance of his troops
and charged into what he expected would be a quick, easy war; as one
scholar noted, \"Iraq \... has committed the common mistake of trying to
bite off more than it can chew, having overestimated its own power and
underestimated that of its opponent.\"75 Iran was both more powerful
than expected and not at all interested in a limited war, resulting in a
decade-long war.76 Another scholar points out that \"Saddam Hussein
should have had serious misgivings regarding Iraq\'s capacity to sustain
a prolonged and ferocious conflict.\" 77 Swept away by overconfidence in
his well-equipped army, he apparently had no such doubts.

Libya\'s Muammar Gaddafi made similar mistakes. Though he had in many
ways hobbled his army\'s ability to fight with his aggressive
coup-proofing, he continued to purchase arms and equipment. Despite
repeated provocations against his neighbors---including a major
intervention in Uganda to protect dictator Idi Amin---Libya was
victorious in none of these campaigns. In Chad, Libyan troops were
barely able to achieve a stalemate against Chadian forces and were
repeatedly beaten back by French supporting troops.78 Gaddafi also
escalated conflicts against states that far outclassed him. Under his
rule, Libya claimed maritime control over the Gulf of Sirte, challenging
the United States militarily and suffering substantial losses as a
result. As one observer noted, \"Despite the political and military
advantages the United States enjoyed in this forum, Gaddafi repeatedly
took the bait.\" Gaddafi\'s overconfidence was particularly puzzling
given his repeated defeats at the hands of superior LIS forces: \"Having
had his nose bloodied each time, one wonders why Gaddafi believed things
might turn out differently the next time." 79

This offers one potential explanation for the findings in chapter and
goes some way toward explaining why [**[oil-rich]{.mark}** states start
**more wars**: their [**overconfident** leaders **mistake** high
military spending for **actual capability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
also suggests an unfortunate corollary: [**oil-wealthy** states are
**not only** more likely to **start wars** but]{.underline} may be more
[likely to **lose them**. [Oil wealth may]{.mark}]{.underline} even
[[**cushion** the]{.mark} negative [**impact** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
losing a [**[war]{.mark}**, providing ways [to **buy
off**]{.mark}]{.underline} segments of [[society and **allowing** a
leader to maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} his hold on [[**power**
despite]{.mark} repeated [conflict]{.mark} **losses**]{.underline}.80
Yet whether oil wealth is indeed a propelling or merely a facilitating
cause of war, it is clear that the possession of large quantities of oil
wealth can have significant military benefits for those leaders with the
wit and willpower to exploit them wisely.

Conclusion

For normal states, there\'s a strong connection between war and wealth.
Leaders\' decisions about military spending are constrained by their
resources, a trade-off most effectively summed up by the simplest of
economic models: guns versus butter. The question of resourcing wars is
a fundamentally political one, with implications for taxation, economic
growth, social spending, and even domestic stability. For oil-rich
states, however, that is not the case. High levels of oil and gas income
allow oil-wealthy states to spend freely on the military, on armaments,
and on military research and development, often without substantial
budgetary trade-offs. The data bears this out: they spend substantially
more than non-petrostates in military expenditure and on armaments. They
are even more likely to have an active nuclear weapons research program.
The notion of resource arms racing---of oil-wealthy states\' driving up
arms sales and fund large militaries---is highly plausible.

As this chapter shows, the ways in which oil-rich states use their oil
wealth for military means varies widely, depending on the
characteristics of the state and the foreign and domestic threats it
faces. Oil-wealthy states buy a variety of weapons from different
suppliers, oriented toward the specific threats each faces. But on
average, across the board, they spend substantially more than their
non-oil-producing counterparts. This spending is also somewhat
inelastic---spending increases when oil revenues rise but does not fall
as quickly, a long-term fiscal concern for policymakers in these states.
Indeed, oil-rich states\' boom-bust social spending is already known to
produce heavy debt spirals; military spending appears to follow a
similar pattern.81 Russia\'s recent military modernization highlights
the perils of this approach. [[The **Kremlin** enjoyed]{.mark} big
[successes]{.mark} in [using **oil wealth** to improve its]{.mark}
ailing **[military]{.mark}**]{.underline} before collapsing oil prices
forced it to make major budgetary cuts to the program. Meanwhile, Libya
highlights another problem faced by wealthy oil states: whether due to
weak institutions, insufficient political will, or a choice to
prioritize coup- proofing, military spending does not necessarily
produce battlefield effectiveness in a military.

But these caveats are in many ways beside the point. The data clearly
shows that oil wealth helps to drive military spending. Indeed,
oil-wealthy states spend so much on arms and armaments that the price of
oil is closely correlated not only to the spending habits of individual
states but to global levels of arms sales. The downsides to this
connection are legion. [Military **[spending]{.mark}** can [drive
**security spirals** and **arms races**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And as
studies have often shown, arms sales are far more often destabilizing
than stabilizing.82 Research suggests that [the **[recent]{.mark}** wave
of **[conflict]{.mark}** that has [consumed the Middle East is
**endogenous** to **high oil prices**]{.mark} during the
2000s]{.underline}.83 Policymakers should be aware that, thanks to
petrostates, [[**high** oil **prices**]{.mark} can]{.underline}
sometimes [[be a **recipe** for]{.mark} regional
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We build upon this discussion in
chapter 4, exploring the other uses of oil wealth in foreign policy.
From the dark side (petroleum proxies) to the light side (oil altruism),
the following chapter aims to show that oil wealth impacts foreign
policy through more than just military spending.

Putin can be so aggressive: Oil." The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/27/theres-reason-putin-can-be-so-aggressive-oil/)

Russia's [[oil]{.mark} wealth **[intensifies]{.mark}** the problem
of]{.underline} personalist rule and [[**aggressive** foreign
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of us coined the term
"petro-aggression," indicating the link between oil and war. [It turns
out that **major** oil-[exporting countries]{.mark}]{.underline} like
Russia, known as petrostates, [[are]{.mark} about [**50 percent** more
**conflict prone**]{.mark} than non-petrostates]{.underline}, on
average, [[and oil]{.mark} has [**played a role** in]{.mark} 25 to [**50
percent** of recent **wars**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Other petrostates with aggressive pasts include **Iraq**, **Libya** and
**Iran**]{.underline}. Not every petrostate is conflict-prone, of
course. Much depends on the leader's preferences. When a leader is not
interested in revising the status quo, there is nothing about oil that
inherently leads to conflict.

[In the hands of an **aggressive** or revisionist leader]{.underline}
like Putin, however, [[oil can]{.mark} further **[reduce]{.mark}**
domestic [political **constraints**]{.mark}. Oil money [allows]{.mark}
an autocrat [to **buy off**]{.mark} domestic **[opposition]{.mark}**,
build a military **machine** [and create a **war chest** to ward]{.mark}
off **[sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In that sense, Putin is
following in the footsteps of other petrostate dictators like Hussein
and Moammar Gaddafi. Oil and energy also helped set the 2014 political
context for Putin's invasion of Crimea.

#### High prices cause war\-\--satiates opposition at home and boosts war chests. 

**Bunzel 18**, M.A., Global Theory and International Economics, formerly

Mean More International Conflict?" The American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/30/do-high-oil-prices-mean-more-international-conflict/)

But the relationship may also work the other way around: [Oil
prices]{.underline} can also be [a **key input** into
geopolitics]{.underline}. Many [[studies]{.mark} have
[demonstrated]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**oil prices** have]{.mark}
**a [direct effect]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the]{.underline} domestic
[[stability of **petrostates**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This makes ample
intuitive sense: [[Higher **prices** fill]{.mark} public
**[coffers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, allowing governments [[to
**palliate**]{.mark} needy [**populations** and]{.mark} potential [elite
**opposition**]{.mark} groups]{.underline} by dispensing more largesse.
Some regime elites may reason that [a **firmer grip** on power may [free
them to **carry out**]{.mark} more [**assertive** foreign
policies]{.mark} without]{.underline} fear of [being **undermined** at
home]{.underline}.

There are, however, several complications to this general intuition.
Some states already have sufficiently buoyant revenues relative to their
small populations to satisfy their publics and feed clientelistic
networks. Providing largesse can also backfire if prices drop; taking
away something valuable that people have grown used to is a dangerous
game, especially when elites aren't ready to play it. And then of course
there is the famed "oil curse": For all sorts of reasons, from "Dutch
disease" economic distortions to the derangement of normal citizen-state
relationships, oil riches can in time undermine regimes, weakening and
even destroying them.

That said, a more recent body of [**[research]{.mark}** has [empirically
demonstrated]{.mark} the intuitive]{.underline} twin of this
[conclusion: [**Higher prices** cause]{.mark} greater interstate
**[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline} by oil-producing countries. Why
would this be the case? [[Greater **oil revenue** flushes]{.mark}
petro[states with **confidence** and]{.mark} also **[cash]{.mark}** that
they can put [toward]{.mark} **military spending** or [foreign
**adventures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To take one obvious example, we
need only [look to **Iran's**]{.underline} using its [oil **revenue** to
fund **proxy** groups]{.underline} such [as **Hamas** and
**Hezbollah**]{.underline}. Furthermore, military spending by one
regional oil producer can beget spending by others, [fueling regional
**arms races** that can make **aggression** and **conflict** by
miscalculation more **likely**]{.underline}. The onset of the
[**Iran-Iraq** War in]{.underline} September [**1980** may be a prime
**example**]{.underline} of that dynamic.

###  1AR\-\--I/L\-\--AT: Jang and Smith

#### Jang and Smith frequent academic [amateur hour]{.underline}. 

**Colgan 21**, International Service Professor, American University
(Jeff Colgan, 2021, "Petro-Aggression, Confirmed," Security Studies,
Vol. 30, No. 4, University of Kansas Libraries, Taylor and Francis)

The fifth reason to [have [**confidence** in petro-**aggression** comes
from]{.mark} the [qualitative **evidence**]{.mark}]{.underline} that I
offered in my 2013 book.12 [[**Jang** and **Smith**]{.underline}]{.mark}
write, "Econometric research could benefit from reengagement with
close-range regional expertise," 13 but they [[chose **not** to engage
with the]{.mark} **five chapter-length [case studies]{.mark} I conducted
[of]{.mark}** [Iraq, **Iran**, Libya, Venezuela, and **Saudi**]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}. The first four of those cases offer within-country
variation with respect to revolutionary governments; the fifth, Saudi
Arabia, [serves as a prominent **example**]{.underline} of
nonrevolutionary petrostates. [[The book's]{.mark} qualitative
**[analysis]{.mark}** complements the quantitative analysis and [offers
**distinct advantages** in]{.mark} terms of process
**[tracing]{.mark}**, congruence [**testing**, and]{.mark} contextual
**[analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}.14

The country-case histories in Petro-Aggression illustrate the causal
mechanisms. For instance, the cases show that [[oil revenues offer
**petro**]{.mark}**state** [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} considerable
[political **[autonomy]{.mark}** from their population, [shielding them
from]{.mark} the political [**backlash** if they engage in]{.mark}
military **[adventurism]{.mark}**]{.underline} in foreign policy.
Remarkably, no petro-revolutionary leader who lost a war has been forced
out of office due to domestic political backlash, even though leaders of
non-petrostates who lose wars are frequently punished this way.15
Anticipation of those outcomes should induce leaders in non-petrostates
to be cautious about instigating military conflicts, but
[[leaders]{.mark} in **petrostates** [need not be]{.mark} so
**[cautious]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, there is strong
qualitative evidence that revolutionary [leaders tend to be **risk
tolerant**, which plausibly makes them more **likely** to engage in
interstate **conflict**.]{.underline}

The sixth and final reason to have confidence in petro-aggression stems
from considering the full range of efforts to test petro-aggression's
empirical robustness. Jang and Smith conclude that the evidence for
petro-aggression is "not robust" and "quite weak," phrases which
normally suggest the finding is fragile to multiple alternative
specifications.16 Yet, [in my]{.underline} 2010 article and [2013
book]{.underline} on petro-aggression, I described some of the many
robustness checks I conducted. For instance, [I used data from the
**I**nternational **C**risis **B**ehavior dataset as a **measure** of
conflict instead of **MIDs**]{.underline}. I also used other measures of
the dependent variable, such as the "Side A" indicator for the conflict
initiator. I used four different variants of the definition of
petrostate (for example, continuous measures of oil income per capita or
as fraction of GDP), each of which were substituted for the dichotomous
measure of petrostate, and the regressions retested. [[I used **logit**
and **rare events**]{.mark} logit [regressions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
dataset on revolutionary governments has a secondary variable called
ambiguous that indicate borderline cases or cases where information was
missing; that variable was used for robustness testing. I used
dichotomous measures of democracy instead of continuous ones. [I
[added]{.mark} **various** potential [**control**
variables]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as: year fixed effects; a lagged
dependent variable ([to control [for]{.mark} **rivalries** and
[**ongoing** disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}); and the Correlates of War
measure composite indicator of national capability (CINC). [The
[**models** were]{.mark} also **[retested]{.mark}**]{.underline} when
the sample was restricted to developing countries only, and when [all
the independent **variables** were **lagged**]{.underline} by one year,
[to avoid possible endogeneity]{.underline}. [[In **none** of
these]{.mark} robustness [**tests** did **any**]{.mark} of the [results
**change**]{.mark}]{.underline} materially.

### I/L\-\--High Prices\-\--Econ\-\--AT: Oil DA\-\--2AC

#### Oil rents are [volatile]{.underline}, [monopolize growth]{.underline} vectors, and cause [inequality]{.underline} and [corruption]{.underline}: kills development. 

**GIM 22**, Generation Investment Management, an ESG-based investment

GIM,
https://www.generationim.com/our-thinking/insights/fossil-fuels-the-economy-and-instability-why-the-world-s-dependence-on-fossil-fuels-hurts-the-economy-and-creates-instability/)

Take the economy first. Using World Bank data, we divide all countries
into "oil-dependent" and "non-oil dependent" states, using a simple
threshold: a country is oil-dependent if profits from oil account for
more than 5% of GDP. Our analysis finds that [in the past decade the
economies of [**oil-dependent** states]{.mark} have [grow]{.mark}n
considerably **[more slowly]{.mark}**]{.underline} (1.8% a year on
average) [[than **others**]{.underline}]{.mark} (2.6% a year on
average).

These states are also more likely to be "one-track economies", where
[[oil **earnings** are the only]{.mark} true [source]{.mark} of foreign
earnings]{.underline}. In the Republic of the [Congo, for
instance]{.underline}, where [oil profits account for]{.underline}
nearly [**half** of]{.underline} registered [**GDP**, there is **not
much else** to sustain the economy]{.underline}. These countries tend to
be [[subject to **boom-and-bust**]{.mark} cycles [because]{.mark}
commodity [**prices** tend to be]{.mark} quite
**[volatile]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Oil-dependent countries **[also]{.mark}** tend to be more
**unequal**]{.underline}. Recent research on Iran, for instance, has
found [[a]{.mark} **compelling [link]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} oil
[**booms** and]{.mark} higher **[inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Russia has some of the world's highest levels of inequality of income
and wealth.

[Why does a **reliance** on hydrocarbons lead to such poor economic
outcomes? One reason]{.underline} relates to "Dutch disease". This is a
phenomenon whereby [**[high]{.mark}** levels of
**[exports]{.mark}**]{.underline} result in currency appreciation, which
[[ends up making **non-resource** sectors
**uncompetitive**]{.underline}]{.mark} on international markets.
Well-paid jobs in oil and gas draw the smartest people in,
[[depriving]{.mark} other parts of [the **economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}
of their expertise. Oil-and-gas production is a highly monopolistic
industry: only a small number of people control the industry at any one
time, contributing to high inequality.

[Another reason]{.underline} relates to corruption. [[Corrupt
societies]{.mark} tend to [have **weaker**]{.mark} economic
**[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In part this is because weak property
rights dissuade investment; in part this is because getting stuff done
is just more difficult. [A huge range of [**evidence** shows]{.mark}
that **oil-dependent** states tend to be more **corrupt**]{.underline}.
One paper by two IMF researchers, for instance, found that [an "increase
in **[oil rents]{.mark}** significantly [increase]{.mark}s
**[corruption]{.mark}**]{.underline}". This is in large part because the
potential payoffs to corruption --- in the form of access to huge
reserves of liquid gold --- are high.

###  1AR\-\--I/L\-\--High Prices\-\--Small States

#### Oil rents turn [growth]{.underline}, [corruption]{.underline}, [violence]{.underline}, and [instability]{.underline}. Renewables solve. 

**GIM 22**, Generation Investment Management, an ESG-based investment

https://www.generationim.com/our-thinking/insights/fossil-fuels-the-economy-and-instability-why-the-world-s-dependence-on-fossil-fuels-hurts-the-economy-and-creates-instability/)

[For similar reasons [**oil-rich** states are]{.mark} also **more
likely** to be [politically **unstable**]{.mark}]{.underline}---the
second part of our argument. In part [this is [a **direct result** of
the fact]{.mark} that [their economies are
**weaker**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [there is something inherently
**unstable** about a country that **relies** heavily on **fossil
fuels**. [Whoever is in charge of]{.mark} **oil [rents]{.mark}**
[has]{.mark} a [licence to **print money**]{.mark}]{.underline}: beyond
maintenance, pumping oil neither requires much particular expertise nor
new ideas. [[**Control** is all that **matters**. As such]{.mark},
**political [violence]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} very **[high
rewards]{.mark}**. "Strongmen" political leaders are **more likely** to
emerge]{.underline}. Might is right.

Fossil-fuel-rich states are, indeed, more likely to be autocratic. A
recent paper in World Politics, an academic journal, found convincing
evidence that "oil exports are strongly associated with authoritarian
rule \[and\] that this effect is not limited to the Middle East".

Generation's analysis of data from Freedom House , a research
organisation, backs up this point. Oil-dependent countries, we estimate,
are approximately 40% less free than other countries (as measured on a
one-to-seven scale). In addition, oil-dependent countries have become
considerably less free over the past 30 years (other countries have
become somewhat more free over the same period). Oil, in sum, is the
enemy of democracy.

CONCLUSION

It is important to acknowledge that [[the West's]{.mark} continued
[**reliance** on oil]{.mark} and gas [perpetuates the]{.mark}
"**resource [curse]{.mark}**"]{.underline}. By using fossil fuels, we
are not simply cooking the planet, as bad as that may be. We are also
[[consigning]{.mark} a huge **chunk** of [the world]{.mark}'s
**population** [to weak]{.mark} economic [growth, **political
violence**]{.mark}]{.underline} and undemocratic government.

There are good reasons to believe that [**[renewable]{.mark}**-energy
**generation**]{.underline}, operated at scale, [[will **not** have
these]{.mark} **same** pernicious **[effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
one, a large body of research suggests that [renewable
energy]{.underline} is more labour-intensive: this [helps **spread** the
economic **rewards** around more widely]{.underline}, reducing
inequality. The geographical distribution of renewable-energy generation
--- both within countries and between them --- is also wider. Few
countries can produce oil; but very few countries cannot produce
renewable energy. [[Most]{.mark} people [cannot dig an **oil well** in
their **garden**, but]{.mark} most people [can put]{.mark} a
**[solar]{.mark} panel** [on their **roof**]{.mark}. The political
dynamics are thus completely **different**.]{.underline}

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has focused minds on the consequences of
Western energy dependence. It is, however, also important to cast the
net wider. [Hydrocarbons]{.underline} are not just environmentally
unsustainable: they [weaken the **social**, political and **economic**
fabric]{.underline} too. We can only hope that this crisis will
accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels and towards a cleaner
future.

Correlation is not, of course, causation. Prof. Røed Larsen of the
Norwegian Business School notes that oil has been good for that
nation.62 There are examples that both illustrate and contradict the
resource curse hypothesis. While [the **DRC**, rich in]{.underline}
diamonds, cobalt and [other resources, has been a **sad**
story]{.underline} for a long time, **[Botswana]{.underline}**, also
diamond rich, has done better than [most resource-rich **African**
nations]{.underline} both economically and with respect to governance.63
Some empirical work has been critical of the resource curse findings,64
including one statistical study finding that resource wealth is
beneficial [in East **Asia** and **Latin America**]{.underline}.65
[Taking [the literature **as a whole**]{.mark}, however, it would be
fair to say that **[more often]{.mark} than not**, **[oil]{.mark}** and
mineral **[wealth]{.mark}** have [been associated with **less** economic
**development**]{.mark}]{.underline} and less personal freedom.

While there is broad agreement that this correlation exists, there is no
consensus explanation for why it exists. Most analyses suggest it is
related to the quality of governance and property rights institutions,
an analysis which has a "chicken-and-egg" flavor to it.66 Other studies
have tried to measure the rule of law, finding that weak institutions
mean a lack of constraints on plundering by the ruling class.67 Again,
this does not show how to resolve the problem. [In many
nations]{.underline}, the generation of [**[wealth]{.mark}** from
resources **[does not]{.mark}** help to [create]{.mark} better
**[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.68 Some analyses suggest that
[natural [**resources** increase]{.mark} costly [**internal struggles**
for control]{.mark}]{.underline}.69 For example, Auty argues that growth
in a country requires reinvestment of rents70 in markets, not
politics.71 [In resource-rich countries, **[rents]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from resources [[are]{.mark} often [**used** in political
contests]{.mark} for **control**]{.underline} and are controlled by the
ruling class, [[rather than]{.mark} being [**invested** in
wealth]{.mark}-creating activities]{.underline} that boost the wider
economy over time.72 Not surprisingly, [resource-[rich
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} often [**[suffer]{.mark}** under
[authoritarian governments]{.mark}]{.underline}73 [[and]{.mark} from
**[internal conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.74 [[Economies that relied
on]{.mark} **extraction**]{.underline} and exports [from
[oil]{.mark}]{.underline}, minerals or plantation crops [[were]{.mark}
**more [likely]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} develop slavery,
dictatorships and state control75 and [[suffer]{.mark} from **greater**
levels of **[corruption]{.mark}**]{.underline}.76

Another obtained result is that [non-renewable energy]{.underline}
consumption [is **positively** associated with
**terrorism**]{.underline}. For example, the CUP-FM estimator shows that
[[a 1% **increase** in non-renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark}
consumption causes [[rises **terrorism**]{.mark} by 0.708%]{.underline}.
As an increase, 1% in non-renewable energy consumption terrorism
increases as well by 0.246%, according to the CUP-BC. [The primary
energy **consumption**]{.underline} (in exajoules) [is]{.underline}
92.97, 157.65, 35.43, 12.19, 12.64, and 31.30 [for the
**USA**]{.underline}, China, India, Iran, Germany, and Russia,
respectively \[38\]. This outcome contradicts the findings obtained by
Mohamed et al. \[33\] for Pakistan. Most of these countries are
vulnerable to geopolitical risks and conflicts except Germany. After the
September 11 attacks, the USA gave more importance to terrorism and
increased its military expenditures. Likewise, China, Russia, India, and
Iran frequently encounter regional and global conflicts and instability.
In this process, the possibility of conflict has increased, and the arms
race has escalated in the face of growing geopolitical risks and
uncertainties. Thus, increasing militarism is required to use more
non-renewables, and it causes conflicts and instability in capturing
non-renewable resources such as oil. [[In contrast,
**renewable**]{.mark} energy [consumption]{.mark} has [**negatively**
affected **terrorism**]{.mark}. A [1% **increase**]{.mark} in renewable
energy consumption [cause a]{.mark} 0.315% and 0.631% [**decline** in
terror]{.mark}ism]{.underline} for the CUP-FM and CUP-BC estimators,
respectively. The share of the renewable energy consumption is 25.6%;
18.7%; 5.7%; 4.5%; and 0.2% for China, USA, Germany, India, and Russia
respectively in 2021 \[38\]. This finding is consistent with earlier
results documented by Mohamed et al. \[8\]. As emphasized above,
[[renewable energy]{.mark} sources allow the **countries** to enhance
energy **security** and [discourage]{.mark} rebels and [**terrorists**

As emphasized before, the empirical literature has investigated mainly
socio-economic determinants of terrorism. But recently, scholars tended
to explore other dimensions of terrorism, too, except traditional
socio-economic determinants. In this context, the impact of nonrenewable
and renewable energy sources on terrorism is fresh. Ajide and Alimi
\[51\] empirically examined [the [**nexus** between]{.mark} natural
[resource **rents** and terror]{.mark}ism]{.underline} by controlling
income inequality [[with]{.mark} the [data of
**34**]{.mark}]{.underline} African **[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**
over the period 1980--2012. They [assessed that natural resource [rents
**positively** impact **terrorism**]{.mark}]{.underline} when inequality
indicators are considered. Furthermore, the marginal impact of the
mutual relations between natural resource rents and inequality on
terrorism is negative. Lee \[52\] tried to reveal [the [**effect** of
oil on **terrorism**]{.mark} in oil-producing]{.underline} and
non-oil-producing [countries]{.underline} for the period of 1968--2006
and found out that [oil [**strongly** correlates]{.mark} with
**terrorism**]{.underline}. Orbaneja et al. \[53\] argued the
relationship between terrorism and the Middle East's oil market spanning
January of 2000--June of 2016. They put forward that terrorist attacks
significantly cause huge oil returns by inflating crude oil prices.

To absorb [an influx of **[petro-dollars]{.mark}**]{.underline} is a
complex issue for any nation. Countries with [these [windfalls]{.mark}
struggle to responsibly **process** the excess
**liquidity**]{.underline}. Often [they [initiate]{.mark} large,
[**capital-intensive** projects without]{.mark}]{.underline} meaningful
[[due diligence]{.underline}]{.mark} or feasibility studies,
[sacrificing wise **investment**]{.underline}. Expenditure on lesser
prioritised projects takes precedence. They accelerate existing projects
accompanied by lavish expenditure. [Then, faced with rising
**inflation**]{.underline} as a result of unmatched productivity, [they
race to **absorb** the **liquidity** and therefore relax financial
discipline]{.underline} and propriety. [[The]{.mark} combined
[effect]{.mark}]{.underline} of these factors [[leads
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the appreciation of the currency, which hastens
the [**[worsening]{.mark}** performance of the [**economy** and]{.mark}
renders the **non-oil** sectors **uncompetitive**]{.underline} as
exchange rates soar. [This]{.underline} particular phenomenon, sometimes
known as the "Dutch disease", [resulted in the]{.underline} near
[[**demise** of]{.mark} the [**non-oil** sectors]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the Netherlands.

[[Studies]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n]{.underline} that [[following an
**oil boom**]{.underline}]{.mark}, an imbalance results as the [non-oil
sectors are left **underdeveloped**]{.underline}. As demand rises for
capital and labour, [the booming **oil sector** draws away]{.underline}
those same factors [from essential but [**less-lucrative**
sectors]{.mark}, such as agriculture, leaving them
**[enfeebled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The windfall, having created a
concomitant abundance and ensuing vast revenues, higher wages, and
better returns on investments, leads to administrations finding
themselves in new territory. Incompetence and [inexperience]{.underline}
in managing state finances [[creates]{.mark} **higher
[incentives]{.mark}** [to attract **corruption**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### It's [empirically confirmed]{.underline} and causes [devastating corruption]{.underline}. 

**Mohammed 21**, M.A. in Corruption and Governance from The Centre for
the Study of Corruption at the University of Sussex (Kenneth Mohammed,
November 9, 2021, "A wealth of sorrow: why Nigeria's abundant oil

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/nov/09/a-wealth-of-sorrow-why-nigerias-abundant-oil-reserves-are-really-a-curse)

The subject of extensive research, [the **resource curse**]{.underline},
or "paradox of plenty", [points to an inverse relationship where
**wealth** brings a **detrimental** impact]{.underline}. Nigeria -- the
largest oil producer in Africa, the sixth-largest global exporter, holds
the tenth-largest proven oil reserve in the world -- is arguably such a
"cursed" nation.

[[Dependent on]{.underline}]{.mark} their [natural resource
**[exports]{.mark}**, these [countries have]{.mark} on average, **[lower
growth]{.mark}** rates, [lower]{.mark}]{.underline} levels of [human
**[development]{.mark}**, and [more **inequality** and poverty]{.mark}.
They [also]{.mark} have]{.underline} been found to have [worse
**institutions** and **[more conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} than
resource-poor economies.

It arises predominantly due to poor political governance and weak
institutions, coming from the distinct phenomena around oil exploitation
rather than possession -- and is shaped by the multinationals, national
and foreign governments, the foreign financiers and investors, alongside
the structures of states and private actors in oil exporting countries.

[Resource **wealth** can have a **devastating** impact]{.underline}.
Oil-exporting nations such as [[**Nigeria**, **Venezuela**, **Angola**
and **DRC**]{.mark} [have seen]{.mark}]{.underline} livelihoods and
[[economies **devastated**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but there have been
many countries throughout history, such as Norway, Canada and Botswana
who have bucked the curse through strong state management and
institutions that can stand against corruption.

This is crucial, because [the **key thing** [the resource curse is
**indicative** of]{.mark} is **[corruption]{.mark}**]{.underline}: a
global phenomenon [that is [the]{.mark} single [**greatest** obstacle
to]{.mark} economic and social **[development]{.mark}**, significantly
so in less-developed countries]{.underline}. Worldwide, an estimated
[**[\$2tn]{.mark}** is [siphoned]{.mark} away **[annually]{.mark}** by
corruption. [This]{.mark} amount [could **eradicate poverty**]{.mark},
educate **all** the world's **children**, [cure **malaria** and
bridge]{.mark} the **[global infrastructure]{.mark}** gap.]{.underline}

As defined by Transparency International, corruption is an "abuse of
entrusted power for personal or private gain." In 1996, the World Bank's
then president James D Wolfensohn called it a cancer and challenged all
countries to strive for transparency and accountability to combat the
pernicious impact of corruption on society, defining the consequences as
redirecting resources from the poor to the wealthy, inflating business
costs, discouraging foreign direct investment (FDI), draining public
expenditure, misdirecting aid and undermining equitable national
development.

[[Corruption]{.underline}]{.mark} erodes the integrity of people and
institutions. A synthesis of social, political and economic forces, it
[disempowers]{.underline} sovereign [states, **undermines** democratic
**institutions** and [contributes to **instability**]{.mark} fuelled [by
the **distrust**]{.mark} and resentment [of **citizens**]{.mark}. It
attacks democracy by distorting electoral processes]{.underline},
perverting the rule of law [and building new **bureaucratic** hurdles
whose only reason for existing is to **solicit bribes**.]{.underline}

OIL ON FIRE

For new oil and gas producers, the gravest danger is the possibility of
armed conflict. Among developing countries, an oil producing country is
twice as likely to suffer internal rebellion as a non-oil-producing one.
The conflicts range in magnitude from low-level [[**secessionist**
struggles]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as those occurring [[in]{.mark} the
**[Niger]{.mark}** Delta and]{.underline} southern [Thailand, [to
**full**]{.mark}-blown **[civil wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as
[[in **Algeria**, Colombia, **Sudan**, and]{.underline}]{.mark}, of
course, **[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[Oil **wealth**]{.mark} can [trigger **conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in three ways. First, it can cause [[economic
**instability**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which then [[leads to
**political** instability]{.underline}]{.mark}. When people lose their
jobs, they become more frustrated with their government and more
vulnerable to being recruited by rebel armies that challenge the
cash-starved government. A sudden drop in income can result in internal
strife in any country, but [because **oil prices** are]{.underline}
unusually [volatile, oil-producing **countries** tend to be **battered**
by cycles of]{.underline} [**booms** and **busts**]{.underline}. And the
more dependent a government is on its oil revenues, the more likely it
is to face turmoil when prices go south.

Second, [[**oil wealth** often]{.mark} helps [support
**insurgencies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rebellions in many countries fail
when their instigators run out of funds. But raising money in
petroleum-rich countries is relatively easy: [insurgents can steal oil
and **sell it** on the **black market**]{.underline} (as has happened
[in **Iraq** and **Nigeria**]{.underline}), extort money from oil
companies working in remote areas (as in Colombia and Sudan), or find
business partners to fund them in exchange for future consideration in
the event they seize power (as in Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of
the Congo).

Third, [oil wealth encourages **separatism**]{.underline}. Oil and gas
are usually produced in self-contained economic enclaves that yield a
lot of revenue for the central government but provide few jobs for
locals-who also often bear the costs of petroleum development, such as
lost property rights and environmental damage. To reverse the imbalance,
some locals seek autonomy from the central government, as have the
people in the [petroleum-rich **regions** of]{.underline} Bolivia,
Indonesia, [**Iran**, Iraq, **Nigeria**, and **Sudan**]{.underline}.

This is not to say that petroleum is the only source of such conflicts
or that it inevitably breeds violence. In fact, almost half of all the
states that have produced oil since 197o have been conflict-free.
[Oil]{.underline} alone cannot create conflict, but it both
[[exacerbates]{.mark} latent [**tensions** and gives
governments]{.mark}]{.underline} and their [more [**militant**
opponents]{.mark}]{.underline} the means to fight them out. Governments
that limit corruption and put their windfalls to good use rarely face
unrest. Unfortunately, [**oil** production is now rising]{.underline}
precisely [in those **countries** where wise leadership is]{.underline}
often [in **short supply**]{.underline}. Most of the new [energy-rich
states]{.underline} are [in **Africa**]{.underline} (Chad, C6te
d\'lvoire, Mauritania, Namibia, and Sao Tom6 and Principe), [the
**Caspian** basin]{.underline} (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and
Turkmenistan), [or Southeast **Asia**]{.underline} (Cambodia, East
Timor, Myanmar, and Vietnam). Almost [all are undemocratic]{.underline}.
The majority are [very **poor** and ill equipped to manage]{.underline}
a sudden and [large **influx** of **revenues**]{.underline}. And many
also have limited petroleum reserves-just enough to yield large revenues
for a decade or two-which means that if they succumb to civil war, they
will squander whatever chance they had of using their oil windfalls to
escape from poverty.

[The literature on **civil war** suggests]{.underline} that a number of
factors such as [**[oil]{.mark}** dependence]{.underline}, ethnic
diversity, grievances, mountainous terrain, population, poverty,
religion, regime type, and state repression [have the potential to
**[increase]{.mark}** the [risk of **civil wars**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Fearon and Laitin 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Sambanis 2004;
Fearon 2005; Ross 2006; Karakaya 2016). Previous studies show
[[**rentier** states with]{.mark} economies **[dependent]{.mark}** on
oil]{.underline} or other natural resources [[are **more likely** to
experience **civil war**]{.mark}. Oil [rents make leaders **less
dependent** on tax]{.mark} revenues, [which create **weak
institutions**]{.mark}. Weak institutions [in turn **increase**]{.mark}
the [feasibility of **rebellion**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fearon 2005;
Fjelde 2009). Collier and Hoeffler (2004) confirm that the existence of
natural resources creates opportunities to rebel. Ross (2006) claims
that **[[oil]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other [minerals increase the
risk of **conflict** because they [make independence]{.mark} more
[**desirable** for]{.mark} resource-[rich regions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Natural [resource [dependent economies are also]{.mark} more [conflict
prone]{.mark}]{.underline} by facilitating trade shocks (Humphreys
2005). Few studies address the link between oil production and
terrorism, but a recent study by Lee (2018) [finds a [**positive**

[Newfound **wealth** creates **expectations** by citizens]{.underline}

5\. CONCLUSION

The researcher's dilemma is that, to construct a general equilibrium
model with an endogenous price, one has to abstract from a fundamental
property of production and hence of that equilibrium. We have chosen to
retain the fundamental property and to wring as much as possible from a
partial equilibrium analysis. Our model shifts attention from temporally
smooth, convex decisions about the flow of aggregate production to
lumpy, irreversible decisions that create specific, persisting limits to
flows from distinct reserves. Extraction is perceived as an industrial
rather than a consumptive activity. [[Producers **cannot**
increase]{.mark} production [**at will**. They produce at]{.mark} a
[capacity]{.mark}]{.underline} that is [[**predetermined** by]{.mark}
**sunk** [investment]{.mark}]{.underline} and diminished by natural
decline. [Any **increase** in production **requires** sinking a
**further** investment. The]{.underline} incremental discounted [net
**cash flows** must pay back that **investment**]{.underline}. The
analytically important notion is net present value, not the rate of cash
flow: Decisions are made on several margins, but not on the basis of the
ratios of net cash flows.

The single reserve is the locus of decisions for the production of oil.
Each reserve has its own level of development and decline parameter.
Whatever its tilt, a unit tax has qualitatively strong effects, namely,
lower investment and initial production, reduced net present value,
delays and reductions in enhanced recovery, and, in most cases, reduced
discounted carbon damages and reduced overall recovery. [[**Contrary**
to]{.mark} the]{.underline} underlying vision of the [**[green
paradox]{.mark}**, the]{.underline} "tilt" of [**[output]{.mark}** from
an oil reservoir]{.underline} (and hence in the aggregate) [[is
**equal** to the rate of]{.mark} natural **[decline]{.mark}** of the
reserve]{.underline}, which depends on the tax only through the initial
investment.

The incentive to reduce initial investment is stronger for a decreasing
tax than an increasing tax. On the other hand, an increasing tax
discourages investment in enhanced production, thereby further reducing
the total level of output from the reserve as well as the length of
production. Dynamic arbitrage is clear in the results for enhanced
production and to an extent for the announcement effect. Stressed here
is the choice of capacity, because it determines the level of output and
because of the predictions of the green paradox.

The aggregation of decisions and the endogenous equilibrium price path
in Hotelling analyses result from oversimplification. In the study of
the green paradox, questions of comparability among reserves and of
levels of tax effort for different tilts of the tax and different
qualities of reserve are neglected. [In [our
**model**]{.mark}]{.underline} the putative sectoral equilibrium
[[involves]{.underline}]{.mark} the outcomes of [decisions at **tens of
[thousands]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} heterogeneous developed
and undeveloped **[[reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}** and undiscovered
resources. There is in fact no set of parameters among the many
background variables that can be held fixed in order to make the
scenarios comparable. [Even **[though]{.mark}** the [firms are]{.mark}
considered to be **[price takers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, simulating the
equilibrium would involve heroic assumptions about policy making and
about the physical and economic characteristics of undiscovered
reserves. Common **[[assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as
[[that]{.mark} marginal [**costs** are equalized]{.mark} across
**reserves**]{.underline} or that all discovered reserves are in
production, [[do **not hold**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Discerning sectoral
effects, including market prices and total emissions, is mathematically
untenable and requires general economic reasoning.

There is a large literature on optimal resource taxation in Hotelling
models. An optimal tax can be imagined for an industry composed of
distinct reserves, as a welfare maximization of the full equilibrium.
The exercise would involve decisions at all properties, undiscovered,
undeveloped, being developed and developed. An optimal tax is not a
carbon tax, which aims to reduce carbon emissions and damages.

We have considered the class of dynamic, per-unit taxes on carbon
emissions, and consequently on oil output, as is assumed in work on the
paradox and is being implemented in a number of jurisdictions. We have
found a strong tendency for such taxes, be they increasing, decreasing
or constant, to reduce investment and output and hence early (and later)
emissions. Resource consequences can contrast with environmental
consequences, [however: **deadweight** losses can generate **costs**
that substantially **exceed** the **benefits**.]{.underline}

There is one powerful, incontrovertible sectoral effect:
[[unlike]{.underline}]{.mark} in Hotelling models of [the [**green
paradox**, which predict **increases** in **output**]{.mark} at
producing reserves]{.underline}, in the face of the introduction of a
tax [[there is **no change** in]{.mark} current **[production]{.mark}**
from active reserves. For]{.underline} predictions of [the **paradox**
to be realized]{.underline}, the depressing effect of the tax on
investments in development, as well as [the natural
**decline**]{.underline} at producing reserves, [would have to be
**overcome** through hastened **development**]{.underline} of known but
undeveloped reserves. [Ultimate **[production]{.mark}** from each
**reserve** [would be **unambiguously lower**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is vital to begin with a meaningful representation of reality. Our
results for interacting decisions on several margins indicate what needs
to be explained about effects of carbon taxes on emissions. The
[simulations suggest]{.underline} that [the **green paradox** is **not**
a **possibility**]{.underline} of policy interest. As in any model, the
results are no better than the underlying assumptions. Our
simplifications suggest at the least that [the **industry** is far
**more complicated**]{.underline} and subtler [than]{.underline} a
Hotelling [analysis can represent]{.underline} and that such analysis
should not be used for policy. A pertinent objection to a tax is that
deadweight losses, unobserved in conventional analyses, may render it a
socially costly way to reduce carbon emissions. The best bet for society
may be a rising tax, in terms both of the social efficiency in the use
of a scarce resource and of reasonably accounting for the negative
effects of carbon emissions on the environment.

the hard-core ones, but the moderates), the PQ would be much more

### No Alberta Secession\-\--2AC/1AR

#### It's not cut-and-dry -- most Albertans want [compromise]{.underline}, not secession

**Chin 25** -- Falice Chin, Alberta Senior Producer for The Hub Canada,
Executive Producer of News at CBC, MA in Journalism from University of
King\'s College \["Need to Know: How serious is the Alberta separatism
question?," *The Hub*, 5/20/2025,
<https://thehub.ca/2025/05/20/need-to-know-how-serious-is-the-alberta-separatism-question/>\]
//EL

For Albertans, separation is not a yes-no question By Falice Chin, a
freelance journalist based in Calgary and The Hub's Alberta senior
producer Is it time for Alberta to separate from Canada? The question
keeps coming back. It has dominated headlines ever since the Liberal
Party secured a surprise fourth consecutive term---despite winning just
two of Alberta's 37 seats on election night. Pollsters quickly jumped on
the issue, reporting attention-grabbing numbers: typically between [20
and 30 percent of Albertans say they'd support a so-called
"Wexit]{.underline}." Then comes the asterisk: the majority of Albertans
do not support separation. Some observers even point out that about as
many Albertans voted Liberal---27.9 percent of the popular vote. [The
separation question is typically framed in simple binary terms: are you
for it or against it?]{.underline} That's a necessity in top-line
polling and reporting, but in real life, [many Albertans' feelings are
far more nuanced.]{.underline} This was particularly evident in the May
8 Angus Reid Institute poll, which included a squishier option of
whether people would lean one way or another. The responses unfolded
more on a spectrum, with the "[lean toward leave" respondents pushing
overall support for separation to 36 percent.]{.underline} If we borrow
from logic, [the issue isn't so much a yes-or-no proposition as an
if-then scenario. That's where things get more complicated]{.underline},
especially in light of Premier Danielle Smith's demands for Prime
Minister Mark Carney.1 Realistic or not, Smith's so-called "Alberta
Accord" is built on conditions. "If these points can be agreed to by the
federal government, I am convinced it will not only make Alberta and
Canada an infinitely stronger and more prosperous country, but will
eliminate the doubts a growing number of Albertans feel about the future
of Alberta in Canada," she said. Conveniently, a few of those conditions
were incorporated into the Angus Reid poll. And the numbers do swing
significantly once they come into play. For example, a huge
majority---[60 to 70 percent---of those leaning toward separation said
they'd change their minds if the government were to commit to building
Energy East, scrapping the emissions cap, or repealing
C-69.]{.underline} A separate Leger poll found that [58 percent of
Albertans believe federal government actions could influence how they
view the province's future within Canada]{.underline}. [So yes, many
Albertans are angry---**but they're also persuadable.**]{.underline} Yet
the hardcore rhetoric around Alberta independence often pulls the
question back into a rigid binary, even though many of the
pro-separation arguments are built on their own set of if-then
assumptions: If Alberta leaves, then other provinces will grant pipeline
access due to international obligations. If Alberta leaves, then Canada
will negotiate in good faith. If Alberta leaves, then equalization
payments will no longer be a burden. A lot of those ifs demand proper
answers. Meanwhile, Smith's UCP government is lowering the threshold for
citizen-led referendums. Pressed on whether she would act on a
pro-separation vote, Smith says she will "respect the outcome." That
political signal appears to have changed the tone of the conversation.
How else to explain why **[separation feels so plausible
now]{.underline}**? [When asked whether the threat of secession should
be taken more seriously or whether separation is a real possibility, a
high proportion of Albertans say yes, even if they wouldn't personally
vote for it.]{.underline} Most Albertans haven't given up on Canada. But
their frustrations run deep---and their support is often wrapped in ifs,
buts, and maybes that resist easy categorization.

#### Alberta secession is [dumb]{.underline} and [fails]{.underline}

**Hopper 18** \-- Tristin Hopper, columnist and reporter at National
Post, Canada\'s only newspaper. Most influential person of Canada.
Canada moral leader. Beloved Canadian role model \["Opinion: Why Alberta
separatism is the dumbest political movement in Canada today,"

//EL

Nevertheless, while it might briefly feel good to tell Ottawa to shove
it forever, **[Alberta separatism is empirically one of the dumbest
ideas in Confederation.]{.underline}** Below, a quick guide to why [a
sovereign Alberta is a really, really bad plan in almost every
way]{.underline}. No coastline This is a big one: **[Alberta is
landlocked.]{.underline}** The province is so unfamiliar with the ocean,
in fact, that Albertans can often be heard curiously referring to it as
"tidewater." [If Alberta became independent, it would be wholly
dependent on foreign countries for exports, imports and even
tourism]{.underline} (not even a planeload of Germans would be able to
visit Calgary without getting permission to pass through U.S. or
Canadian airspace). With Canada having an effective veto over Albertan
affairs, [this would significantly kneecap the new country's ability to
chart its own destiny.]{.underline} "But what about Switzerland and
Luxembourg? They're landlocked and they're also two of the world's
richest countries," you might say. Fair point, but Luxembourg and
Switzerland also have economies built upon light, specialized tasks such
as banking and watchmaking. [Alberta, by contrast, makes most of its
money from extremely heavy commodities that need to be schlepped to
market at great expense]{.underline}. Both Luxembourg and Switzerland
also straddle multiple nations that they can play against each other.
But an independent Alberta would be an island in the middle of
NAFTA-land utterly subject to their whims. This might be [why there
aren't too many landlocked countries that have decided to secede from a
coastal mother country. To date, the club only includes Kosovo and South
Sudan.]{.underline} Get ready for a layer cake of Brexits For two years
and counting, the efforts of the U.K. government have been almost
completely monopolized by the diplomatic odyssey of exiting the European
Union. An [independent Alberta would **face the challenges of Brexit and
much, much more**.]{.underline} In an instant, [Alberta would instantly
lose access to generations of Canadian diplomatic work: Free trade
agreements, treaties, alliances and membership in international
organizations such as the World Trade Organization, NATO and the United
Nations]{.underline}. In a nightmare scenario, [Alberta would celebrate
its first independence day without trade agreements of any
kind]{.underline}. Overnight, [hundreds of commodities that used to flow
over Alberta's borders absolutely free would be slapped with a web of
baseline tariff rates]{.underline} in both Canada and the U.S. "Alberta
already has a huge issue with trade costs ... the idea that these costs
would fall (after independence) is preposterous," said University of
Calgary economist G.K. Fellows. If Canada is divisible, so is Alberta
This was the chief comeback thrown at Quebec separatists in the 1980s
and 1990s. If Quebec could break up Canada, went the logic, then Canada
could break up Quebe and keep Gatineau, Nunavik and any other part of La
Belle Province that didn't want Rene Levesque on their postage stamps.
Canada has become pretty dependent on military bases like CFB Cold Lake
and CFB Suffield in order to maintain its NORAD and NATO commitments.
Alberta's various national parks are all on land owned by Her Majesty
the Queen in Right of Canada. The Government of Canada inked five
treaties to acquire the land now constituting Alberta, and the
provinces' 45 First Nations may not be down with having those treaty
commitments handed over to some arriviste Alberta nationalists. There's
the distinct possibility that latte-drinking, Liberal-voting Edmonton
wouldn't want any part of a glorious new Alberta republic, and might opt
to become a West Berlin-style enclave under the maple leaf. In short:
It's very unlikely that an independent Alberta could expect to retain
the neat pentagon shape it enjoys today. This is also the most dangerous
factor in all this: The U.S. Civil War, of course, was ultimately
sparked by a disagreement over control of federal military bases. Loss
of labour mobility [Alberta's economy has always been heavily dependent
on stealing workers from the rest of the country.]{.underline} To wit,
here's a not-at-all comprehensive list of well-known Alberta politicians
who were not born in Alberta: Stephen Harper, Brian Jean, Ernest
Manning, Jason Kenney, Don Getty, Derek "Alberta Patriot" Fildebrandt.
Even after the recent downturn, [Alberta still faces a]{.underline}
niggling [labour shortage]{.underline}, particularly [in the skilled
trades]{.underline}. That's only going to get worse if Canada's Cape
Bretoners and Newfoundlanders suddenly have a border between them and
the oil sands. [In a best case scenario an independent Alberta could
conceivably strike a deal with Canada that leaves both countries with
relatively open borders,]{.underline} similar to the frontiers between
countries in Western Europe. But by leaving Canada, [Alberta would lose
any say over Canadian immigration policy, and subsequently wouldn't be
able to control who's coming over that open border.]{.underline} Right
now, Calgary MP Michelle Rempel is one of the chief critics of federal
government responses to the thousands of illegal border crossers that
have entered Quebec since last year. Canada wouldn't have to listen to
Rempel if she was merely a foreign diplomat. **[The debt problems would
be incredible]{.underline}** Canada is not letting Alberta out the door
without first paying its share of the federal debt. As of press time,
that share is equal to roughly \$71 billion. University of Calgary
economist Trevor Tombe noted that [Canada pays an interest rate of 2.27
per cent on this debt, while Alberta pays a much higher rate of 3.05 per
cent]{.underline}. Thus, [the mere act of transferring the debt would
result in an extra \$600 million per year in debt servicing
costs]{.underline}. And as an independent country [Alberta's **interest
rates would almost certainly go up.**]{.underline} Canadian provinces
currently benefit from relatively low interest rates because they're
part of a stable, wealthy G7 country with three coasts and a diversified
economy. An [independent Alberta wouldn't be any of those things: It
would be a landlocked petrostate desperately trying to build whole
sections of its government from scratch]{.underline}. "Our debt service
costs increases alone would eventually be measured in the billions,"
said Tombe. The committed Alberta patriot might counter with "screw
Canada, tell them to pay off their own debt." This might be a good plan
if Canada was some weak and distant colonial power that could be
reasonably told to buzz off. But again; a sovereign Alberta would be
almost completely dependent on Canadian trains, Canadian highways and
Canadian markets in order to maintain its economy. If Alberta tries to
run out on the bill, Canada could simply throw sanctions and tariffs at
the new country until the debt was paid. Meanwhile, good luck forging a
trade relationship with the United States when one of your first actions
as a country was to engineer a bad faith secession from one of their
closest allies and trading partners. **[Replicating a federal government
would be unbelievably expensive]{.underline}** Who would do the rural
policing in the Independent Republic of Alberta? [Hiring the Mounties is
off the table, so does Alberta build its own federal police force from
scratch or leave policing to individual municipalities? Who's going to
inspect the food? Who's going to care for the veterans? Who's going to
collect the taxes? Who's going to run the airport security?]{.underline}
Canada has more than 200 federal agencies, and not all of them are as
easily discarded as the National Film Board or the Bank of Canada
Museum. And whatever you may think about Ottawa's spendthrift ways, it's
a virtual **[guarantee that an Albertan federal government would be way
more expensive]{.underline}** than the Canadian one. Pound for pound,
Alberta is already home to the country's costliest public sector. It has
the highest paid premier, the highest paid mayor (Calgary's Naheed
Nenshi), and the highest paid teachers. [To deliver comparable services,
Alberta spends 30 percent more than B.C., 40 per cent more than Ontario
and 15 percent more than the Canadian provincial average,]{.underline}
according to a 2012 study out of the University of Calgary. Part of this
is due simply to high wages in the Alberta private sector. It takes more
coin to hire bureaucrats when they can easily earn six figures at an oil
company desk job. Either way, Alberta's shiny new federal government
would feature a lot of \$65,000-a-year Edmontonians doing a job that was
previously done by a \$40,000-a-year New Brunswicker.

## AT: Green Paradox

### No GP

#### Green paradox not likely, and wouldn't have an effect in the long run -- data proves

**Cairns 14** -- \[Robert D. Cairns, Professor at the Department of
Economics at McGill University; February, 2014; Science Direct; "The
green paradox of the economics of exhaustible resources";

Accessed 7/17/25 by NT-KT\]

1\. Introduction: The meaning of the green paradox

[In discussions of appropriate **[policy responses to climatic
change]{.mark}**, the **role of fossil fuels, especially oil, takes
centre stage.**]{.underline} There is a **[current sense of urgency to
begin to reduce consumption of these fuels.]{.underline}** A method
favoured by some economists [is a **[tax on emissions of carbon
dioxide]{.underline}**]{.mark}, in essence on oil use. Since the
marginal harm inflicted by emissions is expected to increase over
several decades, a proposal consistent with much of environmental
economics is that the [tax should be announced as increasing through
time, in step with the marginal damages.]{.underline}

Suppose that a global tax on fossil fuels were implemented, and that
governments worldwide could commit to the future schedule of taxes
deemed appropriate to balance the costs and the benefits of oil use.
[Would this development be salutary in the context of climatic
change]{.underline}?

[One theoretic development holds that it may not]{.underline}. The
[**[green paradox states]{.mark}** that **[dynamic influences]{.mark}
may [thwart]{.mark} the [intent of]{.mark} the [tax]{.mark}** by giving
producers an incentive to shift production toward the
present]{.underline}. **[It would thereby cause an increase in damages
in the short and medium terms.]{.underline}**

**[[Oil]{.mark} is an [exhaustible]{.mark} resource.]{.underline}** The
**[[economics of exhaustible resources]{.mark} is [expressed through
Hotelling′s rule]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In its simplest form the rule
states that **[[in equilibrium the net price]{.mark}, the price net of
marginal costs and marginal taxes, [rises at the rate of
interest]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The argument for the [[green
paradox]{.mark} is a **[direct application of the
rule]{.mark},**]{.underline} which **[[prescribes the optimal timing of
the extraction and use of exhaustible resources.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
By changing the relative net values of a unit of oil at different future
dates (as compared to the original equilibrium without the tax) the [tax
may induce producers "to tilt" their production toward the present.
Greater emissions in the present and medium term may be
induced.]{.underline} Since there is a fixed quantity of fossil fuels in
the earth, **[the [greater emissions come at the expense of emissions in
the long-term future.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (In the simplest models
there is a one-to-one shift in production.) [By then, other means to
attack the climate problem may be available.]{.underline} Paradoxically,
[the [tax]{.mark}, intended to help to solve the problem of climatic
change [in]{.mark} the [short and medium runs]{.mark}, may [exacerbate
it]{.mark}, and yet [provide]{.mark} only limited [relief in]{.mark} the
[long run.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[green paradox merits attention]{.mark} from environmental
economists because the theoretic issue is recast by climate
change]{.underline}; it becomes the timing of a tax instead of the
equity and apparent efficiency of having the "polluter pay" directly for
the marginal damages caused. The [[policy issue]{.mark} is **[whether
the tilt toward]{.mark} [the present]{.mark}, described in theory, [can
be expected]{.mark} to play out [in practice]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The **[present paper expresses doubts about the analysis that gives rise
to the green paradox]{.underline}**. These doubts are the product of
**[doubts about the applicability of Hotelling′s rule]{.underline}**.
The analysis draws attention to features of extraction such as sunk
investments and production constraints, which are neglected in Hotelling
models. The paper begins with a brief explanation of Hotelling models.
Then it reviews the application of Hotelling analysis to effects of the
tax on flows. Later, it interprets a survey of the empirical analysis
related to Hotelling′s rule. Finally, it considers technological and
natural features of oil production. These features make the oil industry
more complicated than envisaged in [Hotelling]{.mark} models. Definitive
answers are not possible, but **[[indicat]{.mark}ion[s]{.mark} are that
the [effects of a carbon tax]{.mark} may [more likely]{.mark} be
[conventional than paradoxical.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### **Incentives to move away from oil lowers value of returns -- investors will move away from oil**

8\. Undiscovered reserves and other forms of capital

Exploration is a response to an incentive provided by a positive
expected net present value of discoveries (Cairns and Quyen, 1998).
Exploration cost is a "set-up cost" (Hartwick et al., 1986), as opposed
to an investment in productive capacity (Campbell, 1980). It involves a
sunk cost but no constraint on arbitrage of the output from a reserve
that has been "set up".

**[An [emissions tax]{.mark} would [shift]{.mark} the distribution of
[net]{.mark} present [values from investments]{.mark} in exploration in
any mineral province "to the left" (toward [lower]{.mark}
values]{.underline}**). A **[[tax increasing continually]{.mark} through
time would entail a [continual shift to the left]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
A net increase or decrease in exploration may result. As predicted by
the green paradox, there may be a "black-gold rush" to realize the value
of exploration provinces earlier than in the original equilibrium.
[There may also be a holding back of exploration in the face of lower
returns to the investment.]{.underline} Smith (2012) finds that a
decline in expected net present value due to a tax reduces the number of
wells an exploring firm is willing to drill in a given area.

Any current increase in exploration depends on whether equipment (e.g.
drilling rigs) and professionals are available. In equilibrium, spare
capacity is low. After all, investments are made to reap quasi rents,
not to sit idle in anticipation of a possible tax and the consequent
reduction of both scarcity and quasi rents. [The response to the tax
would have to include changes in investment sunk in exploration
capacity.]{.underline} Because there is a long lead time from the start
of exploration through development to production, any change due to a
tax is at least a decade forward.

Investments in knowledge -- in basic and applied research in
exploration, development and extraction (set-up and capacity costs) and
in the training of professionals (comparable to capacity costs) -- are
also sunk and have long lead times before coming into service. Because
investments in knowledge are likely to be embodied in new vintages of
capital, there is only a [limited effect of such investments on wells
currently in service or under development. The returns to these
investments are likely to be reduced as compared to those in the
original equilibrium before the tax. **Prospective
[professionals]{.mark}, especially more promising minds, may [shy away
from]{.mark} training in [an industry that is]{.mark} expected to be
[subject to increasing]{.mark} [taxation, reduced rents, and societally
mandated attempts to develop substitutes for its
product.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The tax would not have an immediate effect on capacity in refining and
transportation.]{.underline} It is **[[difficult to]{.mark}
[perceive]{.mark} an incentive to increase investment in these
activities in a way that would help to facilitate the [realization of
the green paradox.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

9\. Synopsis

The green paradox predicts oil producers' response to a carbon tax that
increases through time in step with marginal social damages. [The oil
market is in a dynamic equilibrium that balances at the margin the
contributions to firms' discounted net cash flows from the outputs of
all future periods. A new tax affects the balance.]{.underline} If the
tax increases through time, there is a greater effect on later than
earlier marginal flows. Whatever the model, there is an incentive to
change the timing of the relevant decision (extraction in a Hotelling
model or investments in exploration and development in the present
model). The reallocation across time is comparable to that of
reallocation in a static model in response to a tax that varies across
jurisdictions.

[In a Hotelling model the reallocation is unrestricted.]{.underline} The
industry changes the "tilt" of its output (the slope of the path of
output through time) by increasing current production.

In a technological model, **[[the extent to which the industry can act
upon the incentive is limited]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Contrary to a
Hotelling model, **[it is [not possible to increase production from
reserves]{.mark} that are [currently in
production]{.mark}]{.underline}**: the capacities are fixed by previous
investment. Moreover, for development investments that are currently in
progress (those that will be realized in the next 5 or so years), the
incentive cannot move production toward the present because it is
already being implemented in the present. **[[For the great bulk of
production in the near term,]{.mark} then, the tendency of the
[tax]{.mark} is not to increase but, if anything, to [decrease
production.]{.mark} Responding to the incentive requires irreversible
investments at new reserves.]{.underline}**

[New investments are made continually to respond to increases in demand
and to replace production that decreases through natural
decline]{.underline}. The response may be to shift toward the present
the development of some known but undeveloped reserves, as well as
exploration for new reserves. This response is subject to its own
constraints and may or may not be important in reality.

**[The [tax]{.mark} also [provides an incentive]{.mark} to
[reduce]{.mark} the level of [development]{.mark} investment [at]{.mark}
those [reserves]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The investment affects the
variable a, which is set at time S. [A **reduction in a means that the
[reserve is exploited more slowly]{.mark}**]{.underline} (with a gentler
decline, falling exogenously as), [rather than more quickly]{.underline}
and at an endogenous rate as predicted in a Hotelling model.

Unlike in Sinn's model, there are two hurdles, exploration and
development expenditures. The maximized value of V net of these
expenditures must be positive. Looking forward from the present, there
are incentives to hasten exploration but also to reduce the expenditure
(current and future) when any region is being explored. Consequently,
[near-term discoveries may rise or fall, but there is a
**[medium-term]{.mark} tendency for [less]{.mark} to be [discovered and
hence exploited]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Also, **[[exploration takes
time]{.mark}; any inducement to earlier exploration can lead to an
[increase in production only one to two decades forward]{.mark}, [not
immediately as predicted by]{.mark} the [green
paradox]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In reality[, exploration is constrained
by the availability of personnel and equipment.]{.underline} With
exploration and development, less may be eventually discovered and
extracted, but the commitment of these sunk costs may be moved toward
the present.

If the technology of extraction is not modelled, the sole investment
hurdle is a set-up cost. There is no constraint on extraction once the
decision to make the set-up cost is made. There may be lower levels of
reserves, but for what is discovered, the same pattern of extraction is
seen as in Sinn's model.

In a technological model, [a further effect works against the green
paradox. **There is [no change in]{.mark} the [extraction]{.mark}
pattern [for reserves]{.mark} that are [in
production]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The tax reduces new investment
levels, represented by the variable a. The reduction in a, with the
consequent "flattening" of the decline curve, acts "to tilt" output in
the opposite direction to that predicted by the green paradox. The tilt
of the decline curve is a constraint, not a choice. As it may with
reductions in output alleged to be an exertion of market power (Cairns
and Calfucura, 2012), natural decline may appear to the naked eye, as
well as to the naked econometric analysis, to be consistent with a
Hotelling response.

In short, Hotelling models of the green paradox are oversimplified.
There are in reality two incentives that work in opposite directions, in
complicated ways. The resultant of the two depends on assumptions. If
the prediction of Hotelling models is right and the equilibrium price
does fall in the near to medium term, then a price-taking firm has an
even greater incentive to reduce exploration and development than under
the assumption, made above, that the price path is not affected. The
microresponse of producers appears to be inconsistent with the
macroeffect on price, and hence on output and emissions.

#### Green Paradox does not happen if current substitutability is high\-\--That's not the case for Saudi

[This chapter shows that [a]{.mark} technological [change that
increases]{.mark} marginally the degree of [substitutability of
non-fossil fuels]{.mark} for fossil fuels may [cause]{.mark} fossil
fuels [producers to anticipate lower demand]{.mark} in the future, and
to react by increasing current extraction]{.underline}, leading to
higher near-term emissions and accelerating climate change damages. Such
a Green Paradox outcome is more likely to occur if the existing degree
of substitutbility is moderate or high. I[n fact, [if]{.mark} the
[current]{.mark} degree of [substitutability is near zero]{.mark}, then
[there will be no Green Paradox]{.mark} outcome [associated with]{.mark}
a marginal increase in [substitutability.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### No Green Paradox\-\--3 warrants: Slow transition, demand outstrips supply, demand is price independent

[There are [three reasons]{.mark} why [**the green paradox is a**
myth]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, there is a global increase in oil
demand which is completely independent of price fluctuations. Increasing
demand, mainly from the rapidly growing economies, outweighs any
possible decrease in demand for oil from the OECD countries. [Through
climate protection measures the OECD could save up to 6 million barrels
per day by the year 2030.]{.underline} [[Even if we]{.mark} were to
begin to [say goodbye to oil today]{.mark}, [the transition would still
take]{.mark} many [years. And]{.mark} any possible reduction in demand
from the OECD countries is more than outweighed by the increases in
demand from developing economies.]{.underline} [Secondly, of greater
significance is the fact that the [oil supply cannot]{.mark} continue to
[increase]{.mark} sufficiently [to meet demand]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Even OPEC calculates an increase in the oil supply of up to no more than
116 million barrels per day by 2025. The International Energy Agency
(IEA) calculates a maximum of 100 million barrels a day. This is quite
different from 1976 and the early eighties when Hans-Werner Sinn's
theory may still have applied. Additionally, the current financial
crisis has massively exacerbated the problem. Oil prices are low and
investment is not profitable, as many oil exploration sites are very
expensive (deep sea, permafrost). The financial crisis also leads to
less investment being made overall[. [The green paradox
assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [oil]{.mark} supplies [can be
increased at will]{.mark}. We are far too close to peak oil for this to
still apply today. A third counterargument is that [demand is]{.mark}
relatively [price independent]{.mark}, i.e. it continues to increase
even when the price increases. Oil [prices will rise as supply cannot
be]{.mark} sufficiently [expanded]{.mark} and demand will continue to
climb significantly]{.underline}. [All these [factors disprove
the]{.mark} so-called green [paradox.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Fails to take into account coal\-\--BUT it's not even true for coal

**Kemfert, '09 \[Claudia Kemfert, "There is no Green Paradox", July 28

[The [theory]{.mark} also [fails to take into account]{.mark} the use of
[coal]{.mark}, which is even more relevant to climate change than the
use of oil. The [increasing oil price]{.mark} has [led to]{.mark} an
[increased use of coal]{.mark}.]{.underline} For this reason, new and
more environmentally friendly technologies must be developed which take
climate protection into account. [[However, even on]{.mark} the
[coal]{.mark} market [there is no green paradox]{.mark} as such, as,
unlike oil and gas, [coal is]{.mark} available [in]{.mark} almost [every
country]{.mark} in the world, so there can be no supply cartel as with
oil. Besides, [it is not]{.mark} the [oil]{.mark} price, the
[gas]{.mark} price, [or]{.mark} the [coal price which matters]{.mark},
but [rather the carbon]{.mark} or carbon dioxide [price]{.mark}. [This
is]{.mark} exactly [what]{.mark} the theory of the [green paradox
confuses]{.mark}.]{.underline} What is important is that we encourage as
many countries as possible to protect the climate, and in the course of
this, establish a price for CO2. Ideally, there needs to be a worldwide
price for CO2, then companies or industrial processes which are
deleterious to the environment will not just relocate to those countries
which are not making an effort to protect the climate.

#### Divestment effect outweighs the Green Paradox. The signal of a shift away too weak.

The results show that when carbon taxes are announced[, the
[divestment]{.mark} effect [dominates the green paradox]{.mark} effect
in all tax cases, [regardless of]{.mark} the [implementation]{.mark}
delay.]{.underline} Some of the most powerful effects are felt in the
coal industry, doubling the cost of coal under some scenarios.

[[The green paradox]{.mark} is identified, but it [never outweighs
divestment. It occurs]{.mark} at different moments [under different
scenarios]{.mark} -- for example, [if the oil industry is put under
pressure]{.mark} by a high carbon tax relatively soon. The green
paradox's most significant showing, however, would be under a weak
carbon tax (just \$25 per tonne) and with the greatest delay between
announcement and realisation.]{.underline}

This last point has Ekins sounding alarm [bells: "[We]{.mark} have
[assum]{.mark}ed 100% that the [taxes will happen and that actors will
take them seriously,]{.mark}" he says. [For that]{.mark} to happen,
[policy-makers must produce strong signals and abide by
them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The Green Paradox is heavily uncertain because it's supported by bad models of research.

[However, [most]{.mark} of these [authors rely on]{.mark} two economic
models originally developed for studying exhaustible resources: the
Hotelling and Dasgupta Heal models.7 If these [models]{.mark} are
[unreliable for green paradox research,]{.mark} then [caution should be
taken before economist]{.mark}s begin to [unravel]{.mark} the decades of
negotiations that have enabled the [existing
frameworks]{.mark}.]{.underline} The research of these circumstances
requires the combination of legal requirements and economic models.
[[This]{.mark} present [study reviews]{.mark} the concern that
[certain]{.mark} economic [models might be problematic]{.mark} in
resolving the first question [due to]{.mark} certain [assumptions built
into those models]{.mark} [when they were]{.mark} originally [designed
for other research purpose]{.mark}]{.underline}s. However, the analysis
presented is intended for an audience of legal researchers; mathematical
materials are minimized in the presentation and the evidence is
presented in a format familiar to lawyers. Hopefully this research will
better enable other legal researchers to engage in broader research on
the potential impacts of green paradox models on future climate change
laws and conventions.
