[President Donald Trump is **stepping up** his **support** for
**Ukraine** amid Russia's]{.underline} ongoing attacks and [resistance
to **peace efforts**]{.underline} after more than three years of war.

[Trump announced July 14 that the **U**nited **S**tates is **sending
weapons** to **NATO**]{.underline}, [which plans to **transfer** the
equipment to **Ukraine**]{.underline}, [and also threatened **steep
tariffs** aimed at impacting Russia\'s ability to finance the
war]{.underline}.

[Trump said that the United States would put **100% secondary tariffs**
on countries that do business with **Russia**]{.underline} if a peace
deal is not reached within 50 days.

"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in
50 days,\" Trump said.

[The announcement marked a **major shift** by Trump to increase U.S.
**pressure** on **Moscow**]{.underline} to make a quick deal. It came
during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval
Office.

[Trump]{.underline} promised to end the war in Ukraine quickly, but [has
expressed **increasing frustration** with Russian President Vladimir
**Putin**]{.underline} as a ceasefire proves elusive.

"[I'm **disappointed** in President **Putin**]{.underline} because I
thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to
get there,\" Trump said.

Trump said Putin is a \"tough guy\" who has \"fooled a lot of people\"
over the years but \"he didn\'t fool me.\" The president indicated he\'s
weary of fruitless negotiations and said he wants \"action.\"

\"It\'s gotta be results,\" Trump said.

The new military aid for Ukraine is being financed by European nations.
Trump has complained about the massive cost of supplying Ukraine with
weapons and pushed Europe to shoulder more of the burden.

"We're in for a lot of money, and we just, we don't want to do
anymore,\" Trump said July 14.

Rutte said Trump called him last week to relay his position on arming
Ukraine. Trump told the NATO leader he wanted to ensure Ukraine can
"defend itself against Russia, but you want Europeans to pay for it,"
Rutte said.

[Rutte said the deal is]{.underline} "**[really big]{.underline}**,"
[and builds on the Trump administration's efforts to push **European
countries** to spend more on **NATO**]{.underline}.

"[It will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really **massive
numbers** of military **equipment**]{.underline}," Rutte said,
describing it as "[only the first wave, there **will be
more**]{.underline}."

Trump's posture toward Ukraine has evolved since he took office. He
criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a dramatic
Oval Office clash in February and briefly paused military aid and
intelligence sharing.

[The Pentagon also halted some **weapons shipments**]{.underline} to
Ukraine this month amid a review of U.S. military stockpiles. [Trump
**reversed** the **decision** last week and revealed his plan over the
weekend to send **Ukraine** additional **air defense
systems**]{.underline}.

[Trump said the United States would be sending Patriot **missiles** and
**batteries** to Ukraine that would **arrive** **within**
**days**]{.underline}. Several countries that already have Patriots will
transfer them to Ukraine and the United States will send those countries
replacement weapons.

#### Increasing U.S. Russia cooperation puts NATO on edge.

Bloomberg reports that the [**U**nited **S**tates and **Russia** are
exploring potential economic cooperation in the **Arctic**]{.underline}.
The discussions, which include natural resource exploration and trade
routes, align with President Donald Trump's broader diplomatic efforts
with Moscow. [NATO allies are **worried** about the **growing
engagement** between Washington and the Kremlin]{.underline}.

Key Developments

US and Russian officials have discussed cooperation on Arctic trade
routes, energy exploration, and diplomatic engagement.

Meetings in Istanbul are planned to restore embassy staffing levels,
signaling a thaw in relations.

Some US officials see Arctic cooperation as an opportunity to counter
China's influence, though analysts believe Russia's partnership with
Beijing remains strong.

NATO's Concerns

[European allies are alarmed at US **diplomatic engagement** with
Russia]{.underline}, [which undermines efforts to **isolate Moscow**
after the **Ukraine** invasion]{.underline}.

[The Arctic is]{.underline} a **[strategic]{.underline}** region,
[surrounded by **Russia** and **seven NATO countries**]{.underline}: the
US, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.

The Pentagon's new Arctic strategy warns of growing Russia-China
cooperation, increasing the urgency for NATO military readiness.

China's Expanding Arctic Presence

China declared itself a "near-Arctic state" in 2018 and has increased
investments in Arctic shipping, energy, and research projects.

The Polar Silk Road aims to establish new shipping routes between Asia,
Europe, and North America, benefiting Beijing's long-term trade
strategy.

Russia and China's strategic cooperation in the Arctic has raised
concerns for the US and its allies.

Geopolitical and Economic Implications

Melting ice in the Arctic is opening new trade routes and untapped
energy reserves, intensifying competition among global powers.

The US seeks to balance its Arctic strategy between economic cooperation
and national security concerns.

[Despite **diplomatic discussions**]{.underline}, [tensions remain high
as **NATO** and **Russia** continue to expand their **Arctic military
presence**]{.underline}.

### U\-\--2NC

#### Trump's shift [demonstrates]{.underline} U.S. resolve AND NATO unity.

**Isaacson '25** \[Gila; July 15; Breaking news reporter; JFeed, "Why
The Sudden Change in Trump\'s Ukraine-Russia War Stance?"
https://www.jfeed.com/news-world/trump-ukraine-war-policy-shift;
Accessed 7.18.25\]

Facing stalled talks, Trump rejected disengagement, [previewed by Vice
President JD Vance's April suggestion to **abandon
diplomacy**]{.underline}, [and instead chose to **reinforce
Ukraine**]{.underline}. His plan includes:

1\. Military Aid: Selling advanced systems like Patriot missiles to NATO
allies for transfer to Ukraine, sustaining Kyiv's defenses while
distinguishing from prior U.S. aid. This counters Ukraine's critical
air-defense shortages, which have left cities vulnerable to Russian
bombardment.

2\. **[Allied Unity]{.underline}**: [At a recent NATO summit, allies
raised **defense** **spending** to 5% of GDP]{.underline}, [declared
Russia a **long-term threat**]{.underline}, and demanded its withdrawal
from Ukraine. [This **consensus**]{.underline}, [bolstered by U.S.
strikes in **Iran**]{.underline} and economic pledges for Ukraine in
Rome, [signals **resolve** to **Moscow**]{.underline}.

3\. Sanctions Threat: A bipartisan Senate bill with over 82 co-sponsors
proposes steep tariffs on nations buying Russian oil. Trump's 50-day
ultimatum amplifies pressure on Moscow's allies like China and India to
push for a ceasefire.

4\. Potential Asset Seizure: Experts like Philip Zelikow note the U.S.
controls \$50 billion in frozen Russian funds, which could triple
Ukraine's defense production if seized---a bold, if unlikely, step.

Further, experts like Philip Zelikow suggest the U.S. controls \$50
billion in frozen Russian assets, which could triple Ukraine's domestic
defense production if seized, a move that, while unlikely, would use
Russia's own resources to thwart its invasion.

Melania\'s Influence:

According to an article published by the British Times today, Trump
credited Melania, who comes from Slovenia and grew up in the former
Yugoslavia, as a decisive influence on his shift toward a tougher stance
on Russia. She reportedly reminded him that, despite his
friendly-sounding calls with Putin, Russian missile attacks were
continuing. That contrast apparently persuaded Trump to approve Patriot
missile sales to Ukraine and threaten 100 % tariffs on Russia if peace
is not achieved within 50 days

Why Now?

[Trump's shift stems from Putin's betrayal of his trust and **Zelensky's
diplomatic outreach**]{.underline}, amplified by Russia's staggering
losses, 1 million casualties, 10,000 tanks, and billions in economic
damage. With Ukraine producing 4 million drones in 2025 and holding a
frozen front[, Trump sees an opportunity to raise costs for
**Putin**]{.underline}, whose war has yielded little gain. [Backed by
bipartisan congressional support and **NATO's consensus**]{.underline},
[Trump's **personal** **stake**]{.underline}, evident in his rebuke of
Pentagon hesitancy, [positions the U.S. as the **stronger
force**]{.underline}, aiming to compel Moscow toward a ceasefire.

#### He's [appeasing]{.underline} NATO's hardliners.

**Carpenter '25** \[Ted Galen; July 17; PhD in History, Vice President
for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies; The American Conservative,
"Trump Flirts with NATO's Hardliners,"
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-flirts-with-natos-demand-for-russias-surrender-to-ukraine/;
Accessed 7.18.25\]

Multiple reports in Western news media highlight [President Donald
Trump's **growing** **dissatisfaction** with Russian President Vladimir
**Putin**]{.underline}. The Financial Times reported that Trump had
encouraged Kiev to punish Putin by striking deep inside Russian
territory---perhaps even hitting Moscow---if the U.S. provided it with
more long-range weapons. (Trump has denied he supports such strikes.)

In marked contrast to the initial weeks of his second term, [Trump has
now **effectively signed on** to NATO's **uncompromising strategy** of
insisting on Russia's capitulation with respect to the terms of a peace
accord between Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}. The Western demands
include Russia's complete withdrawal from conquered Ukrainian territory
(including Crimea) and its acquiescence to Kiev's possibly joining NATO.

Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Admiral James Stavridis
expresses the prevailing mentality of [hardliners when he contends that
sending Ukraine openly offensive weapons might be the most effective way
to force **Moscow** back to the **negotiating table**]{.underline}.

[The ongoing transformation of Trump's overall approach to the war
between Russia and Ukraine has been **breathtaking**]{.underline}.
During the 2024 presidential election campaign, Trump portrayed the
Biden administration's participation in NATO's policy of using Ukraine
in a proxy war against Russia as an expensive, potentially dangerous
blunder. Trump led his political followers to believe that he would
terminate the Ukraine entanglement as soon as possible, since it was
inconsistent with his overall concept of an "America First" foreign
policy. On one occasion, he even boasted that he could bring an end to
the Russia--Ukraine conflict in 24 hours. Instead, he has now decided to
help rearm Ukraine and even escalate Washington's support by
accelerating shipments of Patriot air defense missiles and other
munitions to Kiev.

Trump's attitude toward Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky
has undergone a similarly radical transformation. In the initial weeks
of his second term, Trump seemed to grasp that improving Washington's
relations with Moscow needed to be a high priority, and that the Ukraine
conflict was the principal obstacle to achieving that objective. His
rhetoric toward Putin was conciliatory, in marked contrast to the openly
hostile and contemptuous attitude of Biden administration officials. At
the same time, Trump seemed to regard Zelensky as an arrogant,
ungrateful U.S. and NATO client determined to continue pursuing a "wag
the dog strategy" toward his Western patrons.

That phase of the trilateral relationship between Ukraine, Russia, and
the United States reached its apogee in late February, during a
much-publicized session in the White House when both Trump and Vice
President J.D. Vance berated Zelensky for a lack of cooperation
regarding negotiations for a peace accord and a lack of gratitude for
the financial and arms support that the U.S. and its NATO allies had
already given to Ukraine.

Almost immediately thereafter, though, [Trump's tone regarding the
Russia--Ukraine war shifted **dramatically**]{.underline}. [He became
increasingly critical of **Putin**]{.underline}, now seeing him, rather
than Zelensky, as the principal obstacle to a peace accord. [Putin's
reluctance to accept a comprehensive ceasefire especially annoyed the
**White House**]{.underline}. Over the succeeding weeks, [Trump's
comments regarding the Russian president became ever more **caustic**
and]{.underline}, [much to the **cheers** of Kiev's supporters in
**Europe** and the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, [the **gap**
between Washington's policy and that of its **NATO** allies regarding
Ukraine has narrowed **dramatically**]{.underline}. The White House now
is demanding that Moscow accept a ceasefire and commence negotiations
for a peace settlement with Kiev within 50 days.

Ambassador Deborah McCarthy, an expert on U.S. foreign and national
security policy, [emphasized that NATO's focus on the region has
intensified with the accession of **Finland** and
**Sweden**]{.underline}, bringing the number of Arctic-bordering NATO
members to seven. "[The commitment to the **Arctic**]{.underline} ---
though waning and going up and down over the years --- [the attention is
certainly **increased**]{.underline}," she said.

[McCarthy noted that rising **commercial activity**, **melting ice**,
and **military buildup** in the High North are forcing **renewed
cooperation**]{.underline}, even without a formal NATO Arctic strategy.
"Even though [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} is pulling back to
some extent in terms of Europe, it [cannot pull back from being an
**Arctic nation**]{.underline}," she said, highlighting the need for
coordination with Canada and others.

With the Arctic Council sidelined and Russia expanding its presence,
[NATO is filling the security gap through **regional** and
**alliance-level efforts**]{.underline}. "It is not one where you can
toss the hot potato to one of the seven," McCarthy said. "[There will be
**increased cooperation** among the **seven** and beyond]{.underline}."

President Trump\'s tirades against Ukraine and the start of peace [talks
between the U.S. and Russia have come as **painful blows to America\'s
closest allies,**]{.underline} [raising profound questions about
whether]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} alliance [can
survive.]{.underline}

American and European supporters of the 32-country military bloc say
that by siding with Europe\'s longstanding adversary, Trump has done
serious damage to its greatest asset: the deterrence that comes from the
alliance\'s ironclad commitment to collective defense.

The [N]{.underline}orth [A]{.underline}tlantic [T]{.underline}reaty
[O]{.underline}rganization, [formed]{.underline} at the Cold War\'s dawn
[to face down threats from Moscow,]{.underline} is based on the
principle that countries sworn to protect each other \-- with nuclear
weapons, if necessary \-- are stronger together than separately.

\"The first time one NATO member thinks the others won\'t defend it,
that\'s the beginning of the end,\" said Peter Bator, a former
ambassador to NATO of the Slovak Republic.

Allied officials have said they also fear the Pentagon will pull a
significant number of troops from Europe. Last week, Defense Secretary
Pete Hegseth told European counterparts that the U.S. planned to
withdraw some forces from Europe, a person familiar with the matter
said.

The U.S., Hegseth said at NATO, \"will no longer tolerate an imbalanced
relationship which encourages dependency. Rather, our relationship will
prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own
security.\"

Army officials say they haven\'t received orders to draft withdrawal
plans for U.S. troops in Europe, but many say they expect them. The
Pentagon declined to comment.

Trump during his first term berated U.S. allies for failing to meet
spending commitments and freeloading on American protection.

At a NATO summit in 2018 he threatened to withdraw the U.S. if allies
didn\'t invest more in their militaries. Most have significantly
increased outlays since 2014, though still not as high as Trump has said
he would like.

[Now Trump isn\'t questioning NATO]{.underline}\'s existence. Hegseth
told his peers at NATO: \"[The United States **remains committed to the
NATO alliance** and to the defense partnership with Europe.]{.underline}
Full stop.\"

But to [officials]{.underline} who have spent time [in the
alliance]{.underline}, Trump\'s words and actions send a different
message, that he doesn\'t support them. And they [fear]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin will feel **emboldened to attack
alliance**]{.underline} territory in some way.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), the minority leader of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee who recently returned from meetings in
Ukraine and Europe, said [Trump\'s actions amount to
appeasement.]{.underline}

Trump\'s criticism of Ukraine \"gives Vladimir Putin the opportunity, if
he\'s not stopped in Ukraine, to go into a NATO ally,\" Shaheen told a
New Hampshire news program Wednesday.

That, she said, would trigger NATO\'s collective-defense rule,
potentially pulling the U.S. into a war if Trump were to abide by the
terms of the treaty, which is one of the things European leaders say has
been thrown into doubt.

Some observers see in Trump\'s moves an effort to jolt allies into
action, though they say it could backfire.

\"Trump\'s comments are so disconnected from reality and the prevailing
NATO line to date that they are having a significant shock effect,\"
said retired Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Davis, a former senior civilian
official at NATO. \"[If Trump\'s line of attack continues, he is likely
to cause **greater mistrust** and **resistance** and **less
cooperation** **and support** from NATO allies]{.underline} for U.S.
efforts to end the Ukraine conflict.\"

Europeans are already assessing a future sharply different from the past
75 years.

The U.S. will also not co-sponsor a United Nations resolution on the
three-year anniversary of Russia\'s invasion that supports Kyiv and
blames Moscow for the aggression, according to a U.N. official. The
official added that it is unclear the U.S. will vote in favor of the
resolution when it comes up for a vote in the U.N. General Assembly.

The reason for not signing onto the resolution is unclear. Reuters first
reported that the U.S. wouldn\'t sign the document.

Meanwhile, a European official said it was unclear if the U.S. would
sign on to a Group of Seven nations\' statement that similarly
criticized Russia for its invasion, saying there were \"live
discussions\" about \"how the conflict is framed.\" [If the U.S.
doesn\'t join its fellow members]{.underline} in the statement, however,
**[it would show a clear break in unity]{.underline}** within the bloc.
Trump, in his discussions with Putin about improving U.S.-Russia ties,
floated welcoming Russia back into the group, from which it was exiled
after the 2014 annexation of Crimea.

\"[Europeans]{.underline} would [like more robust language
about]{.underline} the nature of [Russia]{.underline}\'s illegal
invasion than the U.S. is currently comfortable with,\" the European
official said. The Financial Times first reported on the continuing
negotiations of the G-7 statement.

Trump\'s increased [hostility to Ukraine and Europeans]{.underline}
could [backfire]{.underline} on at least one front, say defense
officials: orders for American weapons. Since Trump won the November
election, Europeans have touted big purchases of U.S. arms as a way to
solidify trans-Atlantic ties and appease Trump.

\"This is not an exercise,\" said Nico Lange, a former chief of staff to
the German defense minister. \"Europeans have to get ready now to
replace U.S. military capabilities in Europe if the U.S. are fading them
out.\"

While some Europeans, led by French President Emmanuel Macron, have
advocated spending European money on European weapons, many others have
argued that U.S. weapons carry an implied assurance of U.S. support. Now
that assumption is less certain.

\"Europeans should move away from the idea of buying American and force
their industries to more production quickly,\" said Lange.

In a sign of that shift, Denmark on Wednesday announced a significant
increase in military spending and resources for its domestic arms
industry.

[The impact of Trump\'s swerve could take time to emerge.]{.underline}

\"We are at the very beginning of what is probably a lengthy process,\"
said Bator in Slovakia. \"It seems Trump has a much more detailed plan
for how to make Europeans finally wake up than he has for what to do
with Russia and how to end the conflict in Ukraine.\"

An early indication of Trump\'s intentions could come from European
troop deployments. The Pentagon can quickly shrink its European
footprint by not replacing rotating forces in the region, defense
officials said.

European officials say that in talks last week they were told U.S.
troops wouldn\'t be pulled from Europe, but [Europeans are increasingly
**uncertain**]{.underline} how long that might hold. Roughly 100,000
U.S. troops are stationed in Europe, of which about 60,000 are
permanently based there. The rest are on rotations that generally last
for several months.

Even before the administration\'s recent moves and comments, it was
hinting at shifts in European military posture. Trump and his team are
already implementing parts of the Project 2025 conservative policy
blueprint whose drafters include newly appointed administration
officials. The plan calls for the U.S. military to shift resources to
the Navy to combat threats from China.

Under Project 2025, Europe would bolster its own defense, decreasing
reliance on the U.S. Army, which instead would focus on missions such as
protecting the U.S. border with Mexico.

Questions about the future of the U.S. military in Europe came as the
Pentagon was awash in uncertainty after members of the Department of
Government Efficiency arrived last week, promising cuts similar to ones
already made in other government offices. Probationary employees have
been told they could lose their jobs and others feared the
administration could eliminate departments altogether.

Others, who accepted a Trump administration proposal to resign in return
for pay through September, have yet to receive a reply confirming the
department had accepted their departure, leaving them confused about
whether to keep coming to work, Pentagon officials said.

\"There is no plan,\" one defense official said. \"And it makes it hard
for everyone to focus on the job.\"

#### Trump has [shifted]{.underline}, but his posture [remains uncertain]{.underline}. The plan poses serious risk.

University, reporter based in Washington. "In His Own Words: How Trump
Changed His Tone on Putin and the War in Ukraine", New York Times, July
14, 2025,
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/us/politics/trump-putin-ukraine.html\]//adri

[President [Trump's **harsh words** in recent days]{.mark} about
President Vladimir V. Putin [mark]{.mark}ed **a [sharp break]{.mark}**
from the strikingly positive posture he has taken]{.underline} for years
toward the Russian leader.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised Mr.
Putin and predicted the two men would forge a productive relationship.
When Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine in 2022, Mr. Trump called
Mr. Putin a
"[genius](https://www.clayandbuck.com/president-trump-with-cb-from-mar-a-lago)"
for moving to seize large swaths of territory --- applauding what he
viewed as hard-line negotiation tactics.

"How smart is that? And he's going to go in and be a peacekeeper," Mr.
Trump said, adding: "Here's a guy who's very savvy. I know him very
well."

As Mr. Putin's army slaughtered civilians in a Ukrainian
suburb and abducted Ukrainian children to Russia, Mr. Trump called such
actions "terrible," but stressed that he "got along with him really
well." Mr. Putin responded with his own compliments, saying that he
couldn't "help but feel happy about" Mr. Trump's continued support for a
negotiated peace favorable to Russia.

Many of Mr. Trump's comments about Mr. Putin have reflected his anger
about the U.S. investigations into Russian interference in the 2016
election that dominated his first term.

"Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me," he said
in February, seated next to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in
the Oval Office.

But in recent weeks, Mr. [[Trump]{.mark} has [grown **increasingly
frustrated** with]{.mark} his [Russian counterpart over the lack
of]{.mark} progress on a [cease-fire in Ukraine,]{.mark}]{.underline} as
The New York Times has reported.

["I am disappointed in President Putin," Mr. Trump said]{.underline} on
Monday, [announcing his plans to impose "**very severe" tariffs** that
would hurt Russia if it does not agree to a cease-fire deal in the next
50 days. "The talk doesn't mean anything."]{.underline}

"My conversations with him are always very pleasant," Mr. Trump said of
Mr. Putin. "And then the missiles go off that night."

The changes in Mr. Trump's public remarks illuminate the challenges he
has faced in fulfilling one of his main campaign pledges: that he would
swiftly end the conflict.

While he was running for president, Mr. Trump said he could settle the
war in Ukraine in 24 hours, ending the largest land war in Europe since
1945 before his first day in office.

The promise was implausible, but he kept doubling down.

After he took office, Mr. Trump said he had been speaking
"figuratively." By May, Mr. Trump was telling Mr. Zelensky and other
European leaders that Russia and Ukraine would have to find a solution
to the war themselves.

The war is still raging, and Mr. Trump's early message has changed
dramatically.

"It's more difficult than people would have any idea," [Mr. Trump
said]{.underline} at the NATO summit last month. "Vladimir [Putin has
been more difficult.]{.underline} Frankly, I had some problems with
Zelensky."

While [Mr. Trump previously expressed skepticism about devoting American
resources to the conflict,]{.underline} he told reporters last week that
it was necessary to bolster Ukraine's defenses. He resumed the delivery
of U.S. weapons to the country that had been temporarily paused.

"They have to be able to defend themselves," he said. "They're getting
hit very hard. Now they're getting hit very hard. We're going to have to
send more weapons, defensive weapons, primarily, but they're getting hit
very, very hard. So many people are dying in that mess."

Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said that Mr. Trump had always
been consistent on foreign policy and blamed former President Joseph R.
Biden Jr. for the prolonged war in Ukraine.

Mr. Trump "will always put America first, and he wants peace in Ukraine
and around the world," Ms. Kelly said in a statement. After a review "to
ensure all foreign military aid aligns with American interests, [the
[pres]{.mark}ident [decided to send Ukraine defensive
munitions]{.mark}]{.underline} to help stop the killing in this brutal
war."

[Since [the resumption of U.S. military aid,]{.mark} Mr. [Putin has
escalated his attack,]{.mark}]{.underline} again striking cities and
towns across central and western Ukraine.

According to people close to the Kremlin, Mr. Putin is now convinced
that his military could overpower Ukraine's in the months to come,
aiming for a strategic victory in the war that has lasted 40 months and
led to hundreds of thousands of casualties within his military.

[Mr. [Trump]{.mark} is now **[sharply expressing his
displeasure]{.mark}** with Mr. Putin.]{.underline}

During the 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly expressed optimism that
he could work with the Russian leader.

"It's a smart thing" to talk to Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump said in October
when asked whether he talked to Mr. Putin after his first term. "If I'm
friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that's a
good thing."

[After his re-election, Mr. Trump seemed to side with Russia in the
conflict.]{.underline}

He scolded Mr. Zelensky for being an ingrate and asking for more
military support. He sent his envoys to Saudi Arabia to negotiate a
peace deal in Ukraine with Mr. Putin's surrogates --- all without input
or consent from Mr. Zelensky, an American ally.

[In March, Mr. Trump said he was confident Mr. Putin wanted to find a
path to peace,]{.underline} even though the Russian leader was
continuing to bomb Ukraine. "I believe him," Mr. Trump said. "I think
we're doing very well with Russia."

But **[his tone has shifted]{.underline}** in recent weeks.

[After a July 3 call with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump complained to reporters
that their [conversation **did not lead to
"progress."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The next day, Russia assaulted Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with the
largest number of drones and missiles launched since the beginning of
the war.

**[["I'm not happy with President Putin at all,"]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Mr. Trump said on July 7.

Last week, after reversing the pause on U.S. military aid, Mr. Trump
further expressed his frustration over Mr. Putin's recalcitrance.

["We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know
the truth,"]{.underline} Mr. Trump told reporters during a cabinet
meeting.

On Monday, he again suggested the Russian president has been
duplicitous: "He has fooled a lot of people. He fooled Clinton, Bush,
Obama, Biden."

But Mr. Trump said that he would be an exception to what he sees as the
list of American presidents whom the Russian leader outmaneuvered.

["He didn't fool me," Mr. Trump said.]{.underline}

[The outcomes of the NATO summit in **June**]{.underline}---[with NATO

reiterating US commitment to **Article 5**]{.underline}---[show that
difficult conversations can lead to **better security outcomes** and
reinforce collective **commitment** to protecting national security and
**international rules**]{.underline}. To be clear, [NATO's increased
defence spending was not a gift to the US, but vital to the **national
security** of each individual NATO member]{.underline}.

[For too long the rest of us took for granted that the US would just
accept the **global security** **burden** while we accepted economic
benefit from Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}. The US must share the
blame, too---for doing too little to form a powerful collective of those
valuing individual freedoms.

Now understanding the world as it is, [the US is moving at speed to
**rebuild** its **national power**]{.underline}, safeguard itself
against hostile states and arrest the growing risk of a major hot war.
The first Trump administration began the process, and the Biden
administration pushed it forward with vigor. [Now Trump and his
officials have turned the dial **much further**]{.underline}.

Facing a worsened and still worsening geopolitical outlook, the primary
tasks of liberal democracies are reinforcing the US's power of
deterrence and giving Washington compelling reasons to continue serving
as the anchor of the alliance against authoritarianism.

While raging at the US, its [allies]{.underline} should stop to consider
a painful truth: [having let their militaries fall into **relative
decline** and wilfully ensnared themselves in Beijing's economic and
technological webs, they have made themselves **vulnerable** to their
**enemies**]{.underline}. To the extent that it has made the same
mistake, the [US is striving to **correct** the **error**]{.underline}.

We could indeed use a little emulation by US allies of some Trump
administration policies towards China.

[This, and further efforts to build **military strength**, would show
the seriousness needed to gain renewed **US commitment** to serve as the
**anchor ally**]{.underline}. Without it, US allies are at high risk of
losing without fighting, capitulating to ever-worsening aggression from
Russia and China because they cannot fight back.

NATO chief Mark Rutte says [**tensions** between Europe and the United
States over tra**de issues** under President Donald Trump will not
affect the alliance's **collective deterrence**]{.underline}.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Monday, [Rutte also dismissed any
notion that Europe could abandon its **security relationship** with the
**US**]{.underline}. NATO's secretary-general said a European defence
strategy without Washington would be a "silly thought".

"[We have to stay **connected**]{.underline}," [Rutte told
reporters]{.underline}, citing geopolitical "threats", including Russia.

"[The best thing the West can do is to stay **united**]{.underline},
[and I know that the same thinking is still **prevalent** in the
**US**]{.underline}, including in the White House," he added.

Rutte made the comments after Trump has often accused Washington's NATO
partners of not spending enough on defence and threatened not to protect
them in case of attack.

Many European members of the bloc have recently moved to raise their
defence spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic products (GDPs),
NATO's current minimum recommendation. However, Trump demanded an
enormous hike last month, calling for spending of 5 percent of their
GDPs.

[While Rutte said European defence without the US]{.underline} "[will
**not work**", he stressed that Trump-instigated **trade
tensions**]{.underline} "will not get in the way of our collective
determination to keep our **[deterrence strong]{.underline}**".

"[There are always issues **between allies**]{.underline}. It is never
always tranquil and happy going," Rutte said.

Citing unnamed U.S. officials, Bloomberg reported that Moscow and

could also be part of a detente between the U.S. and Russia sought by
U.S. President Donald Trump.

Newsweek reached out to the U.S. State Department and the Russian
Foreign Ministry for comment.

Why It Matters

The Pentagon\'s new Arctic Strategy, released last year, highlighted the
risk of China and Russia teaming up in the Arctic. The Biden-era policy
sought to expand its military readiness and surveillance in the region.

A report by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) released in
December concluded that [geopolitics and **strategic competition** are
quickly changing the Arctic **security landscape** and that **Russia**
represents a **threat** to **NATO** and **regional
stability**]{.underline}. The [alliance has accused Moscow of **hybrid
war**fare operations in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}, so the
[**prospect** of the U.S. and Russia **cooperating** over the
strategically sensitive region would be **significant**]{.underline}.

What To Know

[There have been **tensions** over **NATO** accusing Russia of
sabotaging vessels in the Baltic Sea and claims of hybrid
warfare]{.underline} around what is dubbed the NATO Lake as the
alliance\'s members move to combat Moscow\'s belligerence in the region.

[Bloomberg reported that U.S. and Russian officials have discussed
**economic cooperation** in the Arctic as part of a detente that Trump
is seeking with Moscow as the U.S. pursues an **end** to the war with
**Ukraine**]{.underline}.

The talks are at an early stage, according to an unnamed source who said
natural resources, energy exploration and trade routes are being
discussed.

Politico reported this month that cooperation in the Arctic had been
discussed in talks between Russia and the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, citing
Kirill Dmitriev, head of the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund.

Bloomberg said the [Trump administration is open to **business
ventures** and cooperation with Moscow, causing **concern** among
Ukraine\'s **Europea**n and **NATO** allies]{.underline} who have
accused Russia of GPS jamming in the Baltic Sea and sabotaging
underwater cables.

[The United Kingdom and Norway started talks last week on a defense deal
aimed at **countering** the threat from **Russia**]{.underline} in the
Arctic that will see the countries\' armed forces working more closely,
including protecting undersea cables from sabotage.

#### The plan breaks anti-Russian consensus within NATO, fracturing assurance of Eastern Europe.

[Since the main reason for the]{.underline} fundamental [change in the
foreign policy undertaken]{.underline} by our northern neighbors [is
Russia, the Eastern European states are]{.underline} likely to become
[Stockholm's and Helsinki's **natural partners in NATO**. All
three]{.underline} "[blocs]{.underline}" ([Sweden and Finland; the three
Baltic states]{.underline} Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; [Poland, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania]{.underline}) [are facing
**multidimensional integration** and **coordination of defense
policies**]{.underline}.

Especially **[Poland, Sweden, and Finland are natural
partners]{.underline}** for each other---and largely complementary.
[This has]{.underline} already [been reflected in the Eastern
Partnership project, jointly initiated within the EU by Poland and
Sweden]{.underline}, by the then respective foreign ministers Carl Bildt
and Radek Sikorski. The project was aimed precisely at countries that
today constitute the main field of confrontation with Russia: Ukraine,
Moldova, Georgia, but also other countries, including even Belarus. It
was supposed to be a platform for communication, but also a way to
mobilize, facilitate, and introduce some rivalry between countries in
their fight against corruption on the road to democratization and
eventual integration into the European Union.

[Finland and Sweden joining NATO represents a fundamental change for the
Baltic states and is]{.underline} therefore [a **serious challenge to**
Vladimir **Putin**]{.underline}. The Russian president considers himself
the reincarnation of Vladimir the Great and wants to complete his work:
to collect the "Rus lands" that do not belong to the West, but are part
of Russki mir, "the Russian world." [For Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia,
the]{.underline} main [pretext Moscow uses is]{.underline} namely that
[of]{.underline} "[defending the Russian minority]{.underline}." After
Ukraine and Moldova, it is the [Baltic states]{.underline} that [are
threatened the most and at the same time are **the most
vulnerable**]{.underline}.

[Sweden and Finland are like-minded countries with **no illusions about
Russia. No political capital can be gained**]{.underline} there **[by
pushing]{.underline}** "**[pro-Russian policies]{.underline}**." Russian
disinformation has little scope there. **[The Finns know as well as the
Poles that Russia ends where it is stopped]{.underline}**. And [a
potential land offensive against the Baltic states would]{.underline}
first [have to be stopped by]{.underline} the [northern European
partners]{.underline}. This also concerns the so-called "Suwalki gap,"
i.e., the northeastern edge of Poland, which serves as a land corridor
to Lithuania along the border to Belarus, which is subordinated to
Russia, and the Kaliningrad district. The "Suwalki gap" is often
mentioned in the Russian media by Russian military experts.

[From Polish point of view, making the Baltic Sea a NATO mare nostrum
and the]{.underline} "[spreading thin]{.underline}" [of Russian troops
along the borders]{.underline} (many will have to be moved closer to the
Arctic) [is likely to buy at least several years of peace and time for
better **prep**aration]{.underline}. As the head of the intelligence
analysis agency of the Finnish Armed Forces, Colonel Esapekka Vehkaoja,
stated, "It is difficult to see that Russia will be able to
significantly strengthen its troops near the border with Finland in the
coming years." Admittedly, the Kremlin has announced the creation of an
additional 10 paramilitary brigades to be sent north. For the time
being, however, it is taking troops from across the Finnish border and
sending them into battle in Ukraine. Sweden and Finland in NATO will
significantly strengthen the joint deterrent force, given that the
American nuclear umbrella alone may not be enough. As the war in Ukraine
shows, conventional wars are by no means a thing of the past.

Back to NATO's Roots

Ukraine's brave defenders have already eliminated about 30 percent of
the Russian army from combat utility for years to come or is about to do
so. The entry of Sweden and Finland will block another 10 to 20 percent
to protect the very long border. This significantly weakens Russia's
offensive capabilities. The accession of Sweden and Finland in NATO
itself strengthens the power of countries in favor of increasing
pressure on Russia instead of seeking a truce at the expense of
Ukraine's territory. It also increases NATO's effective defense
capability now without waiting for Germany to arm itself, which will
take years. High compatibility with NATO standards will allow very rapid
operational participation by both Nordic countries, which increases
NATO's deterrence power. Let's also remember that the future theater of
military confrontation could be the Arctic. Here Finland and Sweden
greatly strengthen the transatlantic alliance and shrink Russia's room
for maneuver.

The [accession of Finland and Sweden]{.underline} also [restores NATO's
original mission of **containing Russia in Europe**, rather than
intervening outside of that area]{.underline}, which has proven to be a
failure. [This ends the dream of NATO as a US special task
force]{.underline}. At the same time France's influence will be reduced
to its real size. It would be bad news if Finland and Sweden wanted to
bring their neutrality inside the alliance, but their active attitude
toward assisting Ukraine shows that there is no such danger.

The NATO summit in Madrid showed that the Americans do not want to
increase their military presence in Europe very much. NATO's eastern
flank will not be effectively defended by Germany---it has no such
aspirations or capabilities. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's indolence in the
matter of supplying heavy arms to Ukraine leaves no illusions about the
scale of commitment and sacrifice Germany is prepared to offer not only
to Ukraine, but also to Poland and the Baltics in the event of a direct
threat. [Defense against Russia is a problem and a task for Poles,
Balts, Czechs, Slovaks, Romanians, Swedes, and Finns]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, [stopping Russia's medieval imperial tendencies, on which
security in Europe depends, **requires the unity of the entire West,
including countries hitherto neutral**]{.underline}. Nec Hercules contra
plures ("Even Hercules cannot win against the many.")

#### The plan is a [second Munich Betrayal]{.underline}, undermining the [insurance value]{.underline} of NATO membership. 

Jamie **Dettmer 23**, Opinion Editor for POLITICO Europe, M.A. from the
University of Cambridge, "Central Europe warns against a second 'Munich
betrayal'," POLITICO Europe, 02-17-2023, accessed 07-14-2025,

DG

"We must admit that it will be a big challenge to keep the EU member
countries enthusiastic," Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki
warned in a podcast last week. "We have woken up the West, so we can't
let it fall asleep again."

[Leaders from Central Europe]{.underline}, the Baltics and Scandinavia,
including Morawiecki, [have **a**n innately different and]{.underline}
much [more stomach-churning perspective on **Russia**'s invasion of
Ukraine compared to]{.underline} their [**Western Europe**an
counterparts]{.underline}.

[Countries that were once grinded under the Russian boot]{.underline}
--- [or were anxious neighbors of a bullying Soviet Union]{.underline}
--- have [reacted to the war with]{.underline} what psychologists call
[a **survival response**]{.underline}. And this is informed by not just
the recent past but a history stretching back centuries, [impelling
these countries to commit to a **total** and **uncompromised Russian
defeat**]{.underline}.

[They see their future as **inextricably bound to Ukraine's**, and a
Russian win]{.underline} --- partial or otherwise --- [as their
defeat]{.underline} also. [For them, there can be **no**]{.underline}
frozen conflict, and no **[negotiations]{.underline}** that could leave
Russian President Vladimir Putin an opportunity to regroup his forces
and come back to haunt them.

And this fear of a clear and present danger is informing cajoling
interactions with Western European counterparts here at the Munich
Security Conference --- one of the most influential forums for global
diplomacy --- as [Central Europeans press for warplanes and more
tanks]{.underline} for Ukraine, and for a clear understanding that the
fighting can only end when Russia has been devastatingly vanquished.

At past conferences in Munich, reporters and observers were drawn more
to the interplay between adversaries. But this time, with no Russia or
Iran --- both countries were uninvited --- the focus is on Western
allies and how they will align and proceed on Ukraine.

[There will be much talk of **unity**]{.underline} over the next two
days [and self-praise for]{.underline} the **[cohesion]{.underline}**
shown to date. It will be [an opportunity to display the strength and
purposefulness of the transatlantic alliance]{.underline}. But the
niggling fear for Morawiecki and his cohort is that Western Europe will
tire and, if presented with an opportunity for a negotiated settlement
--- however dubious --- they will grab it.

And it might not just be the Western Europeans.

On Tuesday, after a meeting of Western defense chiefs at Ramstein, U.S.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Western partners had agreed to
deliver more air defense systems, tanks, artillery and shells, as well
as training for the Ukrainian military. "This Contact Group has made it
clear that we will support Ukraine's fight for freedom over the long
haul," Austin told reporters.

But U.S. officials have reportedly been urging Kyiv to make significant
gains on the battlefield as soon as it can, while the West maintains a
strong political appetite to back it and before a Republican-led U.S.
Congress starts trimming support in earnest, or election cycles get in
the way and the more cautious among President Joe Biden's administration
start pressing the question of exit strategies.

[Central European leaders]{.underline} don't see this war through the
lens of election cycles, however, and their [nervousness is based on
**history**]{.underline} --- including the history of Munich itself.

[They've been left in the lurch before]{.underline}, notably in 1938,
[when]{.underline} just a kilometer from where I write this, Britain's
Neville [Chamberlain and]{.underline} France's Édouard [Daladier signed
the infamous agreement giving the Sudetenland away to
Germany]{.underline} 85 years ago. [The Czechs know the appeasement
as]{.underline} Mnichovská zrada, or **[the Munich
Betrayal]{.underline}**.

Then, after the war, there was [Yalta and Potsdam]{.underline} --- the
conferences that [saw]{.underline} Joseph [Stalin bring his boot down on
Central Europe]{.underline}.

But, when the Berlin Wall came down, Central Europe and the Baltics
could finally stop looking east with trepidation and reset their gaze
west, shaping their post-Soviet identities and direction. They had
escaped the trap of history --- or so they thought.

[For them, joining]{.underline} the European Union and [NATO was driven
by different motives]{.underline} than those of other Western European
countries. [They thought]{.underline} these [alliances **represent**ed
**insurance against being entrapped**]{.underline} ever again, according
to Polish historian Jarosław Kuisz, founder and editor of weekly Kultura
Liberalna.

But, now --- as throughout much of their history, going back even
further back from the commissars to the czars --- "the east is back," he
said.

From the start, [Russia's invasion was interpreted]{.underline} in the
region "not as an event, but [as part of a long historical
process]{.underline}," Kuisz noted. And that perception is [founded on
the experience of previous generations]{.underline}, passed on through
public and private education and shared at kitchen tables as families
memorialize their histories.

It also informed the welcome that Poles and other Central Europeans
extended to Ukrainian refugees, in contrast to their spurning of those
from other parts of the world. Historical reasons explain the different
treatment, Poles say, pointing to Ukraine's proximity and the cultural
and linguistic ties linking the two countries, as well as an underlying
sense of what could be described as preemptive empathy.

When asked about their embrace of fleeing Ukrainians, [Central
Europeans]{.underline} of all ages [mention a **moral duty** and
compassion]{.underline}, but [they also highlight worries about the
**conflict spilling over**]{.underline}. The alarm is [underpinned by an
**unshakable historical anxiety**, and Putin's invasion of Ukraine,
along with the horrors of Bucha and Irpin, has prompted a **genetic
shudder**]{.underline} --- one **[shared by all of Russia's
neighbors]{.underline}**.

Seeing the war as part of a historical process, as opposed to an event
that can be arbitrarily or quickly ended, is also reshaping alliances in
Central Europe. Established partnerships, like the Visegrád Four, are
being superseded by a group of countries stretching from Estonia to
Bulgaria --- Hungary being a notable exception --- determined to drive
this war to a definitive conclusion, however long it takes, and to
ensure they aren't drawn back into a trap.

Or, as Morawiecki put it: "We do more than others because we have more
to win, and more than others to lose."

#### NATO [hates]{.underline} Russia. Cooperation would [contradict]{.underline} their [containment]{.underline} policy.

**NATO '24** \[NATO; August 5; North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
"Relations with Russia,"
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50090.htm; Accessed 7.14.25\]

For more than 30 years, [NATO tried to build a **partnership** with
**Russia**, developing dialogue and **practical cooperation** in areas
of **common interest**]{.underline}. Despite this, [Russia has
continuously violated the norms and principles that contributed to a
stable and predictable European **security order**, particularly over
the **past decade**]{.underline}. Russia's war of aggression against
Ukraine has shattered peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and
gravely undermined global security. In light of its hostile policies and
actions, [NATO can no longer consider **Russia** to be a
**partner**]{.underline}. The Russian Federation is the most significant
and direct threat to Allies' security. However, NATO remains willing to
maintain channels of communication with Moscow to mitigate risks and
prevent escalation. NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat
to Russia. The Alliance will continue to respond to Russian threats and
hostile actions in a united and responsible way.

Following the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, NATO tried to build a partnership and pursue dialogue with
Russia, including through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC), a forum for
consultation on security issues and cooperation.

However, in response to Russia's aggressive actions against Ukraine,
including its illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, [NATO
suspended all practical **civilian** and **military cooperation** with
**Russia** in April 2014]{.underline}, while keeping open channels of
political and military communication.

Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,
[relations between NATO and Russia are at their **lowest point** since
the Cold War]{.underline}. NATO condemns Russia\'s war of aggression
against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. [This aggression is a
**blatant violation** of **i**nternational **law**, including the United
Nations]{.underline} (UN) [Charter]{.underline}. NATO Allies, in line
with relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly, demand that Russia
stop the war immediately, and completely and unconditionally withdraw
all its forces from Ukraine.

In addition to its brutal and unlawful war against Ukraine, R[ussia's
behaviour reflects a pattern of **aggressive actions against** its
neighbours and the wider **transatlantic community**]{.underline}.
Russia seeks to establish spheres of influence and direct control
through coercion, subversion, aggression and attempted annexations. [It
uses conventional, cyber and hybrid means **against NATO** member
countries and partners]{.underline}. Its coercive military posture,
rhetoric and proven willingness to use force to pursue its political
goals undermine the rules-based international order.

In light of its hostile policies and actions, [the Alliance can **no
longer** consider **Russia** to be a partner]{.underline}. [The Russian
Federation is the most **significant** and direct threat to **Allies'
security** and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic
area]{.underline}.

[NATO is determined to **constrain** and **contest** Russia's aggressive
actions and to counter its ability to conduct **destabilising
activities** towards NATO and Allies]{.underline}. However, Allies
remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to
mitigate risks and prevent escalation.

#### NATO is committed to deterring Russia. The plan fractures the alliance's foundations.

[NATO is unlikely to alter its confrontational stance towards
Russia]{.underline} in the medium term, and it&apos;s not in
Moscow&apos;s best interests to be the one to extend an olive branch,
stated Vladislav Maslennikov, Director of the European Problems
Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry.

[\"Countering the Russian threat remains a **foundational element** in
NATO&apos;s strategic documents and is increasingly reflected in
tangible military infrastructure]{.underline} near our borders,\"
Maslennikov noted during a discussion at the Valdai Club, which focused
on the outcomes of the NATO summit held in The Hague on June 24-25. He
emphasized that \"dismantling NATO&apos;s current plans would require
significant time and effort - if they are even capable of doing so at
all.\" The diplomat also highlighted that [\"**much will depend on how
relations between Russia** and the **U**nited **S**tates **evolve** in
the near future.\"]{.underline}

He expressed skepticism about the prospects of reversing deeply
entrenched anti-Russian sentiments within NATO and the European Union,
cautioning that \"we should not expect a prompt return to constructive
dialogue.\" However, Maslennikov pointed out that such a dialogue could
be possible under certain conditions: \"The West would need to abandon
its confrontational approach toward Russia and demonstrate a willingness
to engage pragmatically, based on principles of sovereign equality and
mutual respect.\"

Nonetheless, he was clear in his outlook: \"Honestly, we do not
anticipate such changes in NATO - at least not in the medium term.\" He
argued that NATO&apos;s approach to Russia is underpinned by ideological
motives - a persistent opposition between democracy and autocracy, and a
framing of history as a battle between \"right\" and \"wrong.\"

Maslennikov criticized this mindset as \"megalomania,\" describing NATO
as perceiving itself as the beacon of light, freedom, and democracy -
expecting its population to sacrifice social welfare, economic
stability, and overall well-being for this perceived mission. He
observed that this trend continues to grow.

Furthermore, the diplomat pointed out that a [**Russian threat remains a
compelling narrative for NATO**,]{.underline} making it difficult for
the alliance to relinquish this justification. He recalled that
Russia&apos;s relations with NATO began to decline well before the 2014
crisis and the recent military operations, noting that many [NATO
members have long shown **reluctance** to see Russia as an equal
partner,]{.underline} even when their interests objectively align.

In this landscape of "[America first]{.underline}", [the prospect of
Washington and Moscow dividing the Arctic and its resources seems
**increasingly** **realistic**]{.underline}. In such a situation, [the
international treaties signed by the **A8**, and the **CAO** may also be
at **risk**]{.underline}. [Denmark may find itself **excluded
altogether** from Arctic affairs]{.underline} if Trump gets his way over
Greenland. At any rate, [all the Nordic Arctic states are likely to
**struggle** to make their voices in the **region heard**]{.underline}.

[A key question for **European Nato** and **EU** members is whether
Trump would worry about **Russian dominance** in the European Arctic if
it brought US-Russia **economic cooperation**]{.underline} to extract
the region's wealth? [Might Trump even be supportive of **Russian
attempts** to revisit the terms of the 1920 **Spitsbergen
Treaty**]{.underline}, which ultimately gave Norway sovereignty over the
Arctic archipelago (albeit with some limitations), if that too meant
jointly unlocking Svalbard's mineral resources let alone the wealth of
the Arctic seabed?

[The Arctic]{.underline} now [appears to come up repeatedly in
statements]{.underline} given [by senior Russian]{.underline}
politicians and military [officials.]{.underline} They suggest that NATO
countries that militarily support Ukraine could be "dragged into a war"
in the High North in retaliation, or openly discuss a "spill over" of
the Russian-Ukrainian conflict into the region. Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} himself, at the end of January 2023, at a special
meeting of the Security Council of the Russian Federation dedicated to
Ukraine, [was set to announce that]{.underline} "**[Ukraine is not
enough]{.underline}**". He was to announce the goal of expanding the
territory of the world's largest state also in the Arctic.

[Threats of conflict]{.underline} in this part of the world
[were]{.underline} particularly [frequent]{.underline} immediately
[after Finland and Sweden declared their readiness to join
NATO]{.underline}. In May 2022, when these two states expressed their
willingness to become members, Russia's representative to the Arctic
Council Nikolay Korchunov expressed "concern" about this on behalf of
the Russian foreign ministry. He emphasized that such a development
would "negatively affect confidence and security in the region", which
could consequently lead to "unintended incidents" that would not only
generate threats to the stability of the Arctic but could also cause
damage to its fragile ecosystem.

Given that since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine
there has been an unprecedented return to Cold War rhetoric, as well as
the use of nuclear blackmail on an unprecedented scale and a decisive
shift in the region away from the paradigm of peaceful cooperation,
these threats are taking on a very specific dimension.

Significance of the Arctic region

[Arctic territories, due to their **geostrategic location**, offer the
possibility of **attacking almost any object on the globe**, as well as
excellent conditions for hiding and camouflage]{.underline}. As a
result, [they provide a natural flight path for **i**nter**c**ontinental
**b**allistic **m**issiles in a potential nuclear conflict. It
is]{.underline} also [an excellent place to maintain]{.underline} one of
the elements of the strategic nuclear triad -- [nuclear
**sub**marine**s** with long-range]{.underline} strategic nuclear
[missiles]{.underline}. The region had great importance for conducting
military operations during the Cold War period, as battles between the
two opposing blocs were also to be fought in the area. In the event of
an armed conflict, the Far North was to become an area of military
operations that would significantly influence the course of fighting.

However, the strategic importance of the Arctic is not only determined
by issues related strictly to security. According to 2008 data from the
US Geological Survey scientific agency, [the Arctic Ocean floor may hold
up to 30 per cent of the world's]{.underline} as of yet [undiscovered
but technically accessible reserves of natural gas]{.underline},
alongside 13 per cent of oil. [The continental shelf]{.underline} of the
Arctic Ocean [is]{.underline} also [rich in]{.underline} other [mineral
resources]{.underline} such as zinc, lead, molybdenum, nickel, platinum
and even gold and diamonds.

[An important aspect indicating the attractiveness of the region
is]{.underline} the [opportunities related to maritime
transport]{.underline}. There are two routes through the Arctic, the
Northeast Passage (along the coast of Siberia, the shortest route from
Europe to China) and the Northwest Passage (along the coast of Canada).
For decades, these routes were of little importance due to the
impassable ice cap. However, when the ice cap began to shrink as a
result of climate change, new opportunities for the economic
exploitation of the region emerged for the Arctic states. The Northwest
Passage shortens the route from Europe to East Asia by several thousand
kilometres compared to the Panama Canal route, and the Northeast Passage
by as much as 9,000 kilometres compared to the Suez Canal route.

[Claims to the region's riches are made not only by the states of
the]{.underline} so-called [Arctic Eight]{.underline}, i.e., states with
territories in the Far North (Russia, the US, Canada, Sweden, Finland,
Iceland, Norway and, through Greenland, Denmark) [but also by states
with no territory in the region]{.underline} (China plays a special role
here). The Far North plays a particularly important role in the policies
of [the **Russia**n Federation]{.underline}, which [is pursuing the
**most expansive policy** in relation to the area]{.underline}. This
fact is not surprising, given that the region generates 15 to 20 per
cent of Russian GDP, while as much as 80 per cent of Russian gas is
extracted there. The Russian Arctic territories also account for more
than half of the Arctic as a whole.

According to the data presented in 2017 by the Arctic Council, by the
summer of 2040, the Far North will be completely free of ice. Therefore,
on the one hand, [climate change]{.underline} presents an opportunity
for the countries involved in the "Arctic race" to pursue their economic
interests. On the other hand, this [is generating a number of new
security threats and contributing to increased tensions
between]{.underline} the [states]{.underline}.

NATO and the Arctic

The North Atlantic Alliance's approach to the Far North has been
gradually changing over the past few years. The impulse to look more
closely at the affairs of this strategically important region was caused
by unprecedented climate change and the progressive militarization of
the Arctic by the Russian Federation starting in 2014. [The Kremlin's
hybrid activities in the Far North, as well as Beijing's growing
aspirations]{.underline} towards the polar regions in the "Arctic game",
also [**began to cause concern** among member states]{.underline}.

[Allied Command Transformation]{.underline} ([one of NATO's two
Strategic Commands]{.underline} whose main task is to transform the
Alliance's military capabilities in line with changing geopolitical
conditions) [predicts that]{.underline} specifically in 2040, [the
Arctic will become an **important theatre for global superpower
rivalry**. This will generate]{.underline} a number of [**new security
challenges** for the North Atlantic Alliance]{.underline}, as well as
the need to develop a new joint strategy to protect interests in the Far
North. The Arctic members of the Alliance will have to deal with issues
such as electronic warfare, the protection of maritime communication
lines, tracking and combatting Russian submarines capable of carrying
nuclear warheads, and even terrorist or pirate activities (which may be
carried out by private military formations created in the Arctic by
Gazprom). Climate and environmental problems will also worsen,
generating threats that extend decisively beyond the Far North.

Without a doubt, [an important]{.underline} "[caesura]{.underline}" [in
the history of the region and NATO's increased involvement]{.underline}
in Arctic affairs [is Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion against
independent Ukraine]{.underline}, which began in February 2022. In this
case, unlike in 2014, following the Kremlin's annexation of the Crimean
Peninsula, [western states **rejected** **the possibility of cooperating
with Russia**]{.underline} on existing terms within the paradigm of
"peaceful cooperation". In March 2022, [seven of the eight members of
the Arctic Council]{.underline}, i.e., the US, Canada, Norway, Denmark,
Sweden, Iceland and Finland, [suspended their participation in the
Arctic Council]{.underline}, in which the Russian Federation held the
chairmanship from 2021 to 2023 (the chairmanship of the Arctic Council
rotates among all its permanent members; each member's term of office
lasts two years). In response to the Russian invasion, [the majority of
NATO members strongly advocated for increased defence
spending]{.underline}. The fulfilment of these declarations will
undoubtedly contribute to making up for the Arctic deficiencies of
Alliance members in the region and strengthening deterrence on the
northern flank. Rising energy commodity prices may also contribute to
Alliance members' interests in reserves hidden beneath the bottom of the
Arctic Ocean and in the contentious continental shelf.

Russia is currently dulling its imperial claws in the war in Ukraine and
there is no indication that it has the military capability to open a new
front. However, [the Kremlin has an arsenal of means with which it is
capable of destabilizing **any part of the Earth** for long periods of
time. Of increasing concern to Arctic NATO states are]{.underline} the
Russian Federation's "[below the threshold of war]{.underline}"
[activities, which intensified in the Far North after February
2022]{.underline}. Underestimated by the West, an element of the
Kremlin's game that strongly affects not only the imagination of
policymakers but also of entire societies is nuclear blackmail. We
should expect more frequent demonstrations by Russia of its nuclear
power and military readiness in the Barents Sea and Arctic Ocean.

In this context, [from the perspective of the North Atlantic Alliance,
the fact that a Northern European state has joined its ranks **cannot be
overestimated**]{.underline}.

#### The Arctic is key to US-NATO assurance over Russia and China

// accessed 07-14-25 // AA

[Since the Cold War,]{.underline} the [United States and many of its
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies]{.underline} have [regarded
the Arctic as a barren wasteland]{.underline} [with no geopolitical
significance]{.underline}. But [China's rise and its strategic alliance
with Moscow]{.underline} have [made the region a tinderbox]{.underline}
[that could redefine global security]{.underline}. By ignoring the
Arctic, NATO risks rendering itself irrelevant in the face of rising
Russian and Chinese ambitions. [At the 2025 NATO summit in The
Hague]{.underline}, [leaders focused on presenting a united
front]{.underline} at a time of mounting internal arguments over how [to
prioritize growing security]{.underline} challenges [from actors such as
Russia, China, terrorists, and migrants]{.underline}. [The difficult
decisions on how to spend the 5 percent of GDP]{.underline} that the
alliance's member states agreed to allocate for military expenditures by
2035 have yet to take place. When these difficult talks take place, NATO
must prioritize building a credible defense force posture in the Arctic,
as Russia and China expand their strategic presence in the alliance's
northern flank. Economically, Russia's Arctic coastline has tremendous
potential for shipping, energy, and fishing ventures. In 2024, the
Arctic accounted for 7.5 percent of the country's GDP. This figure is
likely to increase. As sea ice is melting, Moscow is advertising the
Northern Sea Route as a time- and money-saving link for the shipping
industry, logging 38 million tons in 2024. The route is Russia's
national maritime waterway, generating substantial revenue from oil and
liquefied natural gas extracted in the Arctic region and transported to
Asia with costly icebreaker assistance. At an estimated \$19.2 billion
in 2025, Arctic fisheries are also an important source of revenue.
[Rising Arctic commercial traffic creates control problems]{.underline},
threatening Moscow's strategic assets. [Russia has therefore been
transforming its Arctic coast into a modern maritime fortress. Its
growing fleet of submarines, including nuclear-powered ballistic missile
subs]{.underline} lurking near the Barents Sea[, poses a direct threat
not just to regional stability but to the U.S. homeland]{.underline}.
[Moscow is also investing heavily in autonomous underwater
vehicles]{.underline} [and upgrading its Northern Fleet
base]{.underline}s, [aiming for sea denial and nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}---[trends that should concern Western defense
officials.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [China is evolving from a distant
observer to an active participant in the Arctic]{.underline}. Russia is
a leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil, and fish from
the Arctic to China, and China has invested heavily in these industries.
As the EU is phasing out Russian LNG, cargoes are increasingly shipped
to the Chinese market. Moscow relies on Beijing's financial resources
and technological prowess to build a credible Arctic defense. [The two
are connecting Russia's Arctic ports to China's Polar Silk
Road,]{.underline} forging logistical networks that enhance
interoperability[. In 2024, a Russia-Chinese joint venture announced
plans to build and operate five ice-class container ships with dual-use
potential all-year round on the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}. While
China currently maintains a limited military footprint---just a handful
of icebreakers and polar research vessels---the potential for strategic
expansion is evident. [Next-generation submarines, hypersonic missiles,
and space-based systems could someday allow China to project power
across the Arctic. NATO's Arctic member states are woefully unprepared
for this new reality. Only recently has the alliance truly begun to
prioritize Arctic security]{.underline}, through exercises like Dynamic
Mongoose and Nordic Response. [Yet NATO still lacks the critical
infrastructure]{.underline}---[polar-capable ships, surveillance
systems, missile defense, and sealift capacity]{.underline}---that would
make it a credible force in the Arctic. [The alliance's approach is
reactive rather than strategic]{.underline}. [NATO nations has announced
some promising Arctic defense investments]{.underline} such as Canada's
plans to acquire missile defense systems and Denmark's commitment to
strengthen surveillance around Greenland. But NATO nations [need to
demonstrate real-world capabilities]{.underline} and increased
coordination with allies before they can truly restore credibility to
the alliance's Arctic force posture. [What's missing? A cohesive Arctic
strategy]{.underline} [that unites NATO members]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} stakes in the region---Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the [U.S.]{.underline} NATO's advantage is
that its Arctic states share common concerns rooted in geography and
security interests. The answer is not broad, diffuse involvement.
Finland and Sweden's NATO membership has fueled Russia's sense of
encirclement and vulnerability. [Moscow now views the Arctic as a
potential conflict zone]{.underline}, making increased alliance presence
and preparedness more urgent to prevent future incursions. At the same
time, [NATO should bolster cooperation among Arctic members]{.underline}
with legal regional rights and responsibilities such as patrolling and
environmental protection to avoid unnecessary escalation. Critical next
steps include extending existing agreements like the ICE Pact to include
the UK---positioned perfectly at the vital Greenland--Iceland--United
Kingdom (GIUK) gap---and develop tailored plans for deterrence.
Imagining an expanded Arctic pact, with clear priorities like missile
defense sites along East Greenland to intercept Russian and Chinese
threats, makes strategic sense. Further, enhancing situational awareness
through polar satellites, autonomous vehicles, and more icebreakers is
essential. In the long term, NATO must plan for increased submarine and
surface warfare capabilities, logistics, and infrastructure
investments---covering ports, command and control systems, and
industrial bases. The goal: build a resilient, credible deterrent
capable of operating year-round in one of the world's most extreme
environments. [But investing in Arctic defenses isn't
cheap]{.underline}. Tensions across Europe and the Indo-Pacific compete
for limited resources. That is why NATO must recognize that Arctic
security is not a bonus; it is vital to the alliance's future to include
Arctic defense in future alliance commitments and spending targets.
Transatlantic defense investments are likely to spin off commercial
investments in Arctic industries such as minerals, energy, and
infrastructure. [This would give a much-needed boost to regional
economies such as Alaska and Canada's northern territories]{.underline},
which now account for less than one percent of each economy's gross
production figures. If NATO fails to adapt to the Arctic's renewed
importance, it risks being cold shouldered in tomorrow's Arctic
conflicts.

BRUSSELS \-- The argument between President Trump and his Ukrainian
counterpart at the White House sent relations between the two countries
into a tailspin. It also caused serious damage to an alliance at the
heart of the post-World War II order: NATO.

Trump staked out a position that many European allies saw as siding with
Russia\'s autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin, by dismissing the security
concerns of a friendly country in need of Western help. He said
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was losing the war and had \"no
cards.\"

The American president\'s [embrace of Russia,]{.underline} an adversary
that has worked for years to undermine U.S. global leadership[, **runs
counter to**]{.underline} decades of Western policy. The U.S. and its
allies founded the [N]{.underline}orth [A]{.underline}tlantic
[T]{.underline}reaty [O]{.underline}rganization 75 years ago as
protection against Soviet Russia.

NATO is based on the idea that the U.S. would use its military might,
including its arsenal of nuclear weapons, to come to the defense of any
ally that is attacked. That bedrock assumption has now been called into
question.

\"I worry that we may be in the last days of [NATO]{.underline},\" said
retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, who served as NATO\'s supreme allied
commander. He said the trans-Atlantic alliance \"[may not be about to
collapse, but]{.underline} I can sure hear [it creaking
louder]{.underline} than at any time in my long career in the
military.\"

Trump on Sunday wrote on his Truth Social platform: \"We should spend
less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant
rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions
entering our Country \-- So that we don\'t end up like Europe!\" Last
week, he said the European Union \"was formed in order to screw the
United States.\"

The White House on Monday didn\'t immediately comment on administration
policy toward NATO.

The strength of Trump\'s [support for NATO,]{.underline} which he has
criticized in the past, [remains unclear.]{.underline} At the White
House on Friday, he said, \"we\'re committed to NATO\" and praised
alliance member Poland, which spends heavily on defense. He was less
enthusiastic in his support for the high-spending Baltic states, which
are also in NATO.

On Saturday, billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump adviser who leads the
Department of Government Efficiency, endorsed a post advocating U.S.
withdrawal from NATO and the United Nations on his social-media
platform, X.

[European leaders]{.underline}, who [rely on NATO for]{.underline} their
**[countries\' security]{.underline}**, have refrained from talking
publicly about mortal threats to the alliance, but some are starting to
talk about alternate plans.

\"We want to preserve the trans-Atlantic partnership and our joint
strength,\" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Saturday.
\"But yesterday showed once again that we Europeans must not be naive,\"
she said, referring to events Friday at the White House. \"We must take
responsibility for our own interests, our own values and our own
security, for the sake of our people in Europe.\"

[European leaders]{.underline} met in London on Sunday, [pledged to
develop a peace plan]{.underline} for Ukraine [and
**dismissed**]{.underline} suggestions that Friday\'s White House
meeting had damaged the trans-Atlantic alliance. \"I do not accept that
[the U.S. is an unreliable ally]{.underline},\" said British Prime
Minister Keir Starmer.

The U.K. and France are leading efforts to develop a \"coalition of the
willing\" that would secure an eventual cease-fire in Ukraine, including
by deploying ground troops and military assets. They hope that by doing
so, they will manage to convince Trump to contribute to their plan some
vital U.S. military resources where Europe falls short, such as in
systems for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance,
command-and-control, air-defense and heavy airlift.

Europe lacks what military tacticians call enablement \-- the systems
and equipment that enable modern military action \-- both for a
potential Ukraine operation and Europe\'s own defense. European NATO
members don\'t have those capabilities due to a mix of their own
underinvestment and America\'s longstanding preference to be in control
of such systems. In NATO\'s traditional division of labor, broadly
speaking, Europe was envisioned as contributing the mass of forces while
the U.S. would provide sophisticated systems and cohesion for coalition
forces.

The current crisis flips Europe\'s longstanding security dilemma on its
head. For years, U.S. strategists fretted over whether they could fend
off hostility from Moscow if Europe didn\'t pull its weight militarily.
Now it is Europeans who are in a sweat, wondering if they can defend
against Russia without the U.S.

\"Europeans are wise to be concerned and to build up their own military
industry and capabilities,\" said Rose Gottemoeller, a former NATO
deputy secretary-general and chief U.S. arms negotiator with Russia.

Gottemoeller said concern about U.S. commitment first flared in 2017, at
the start of Trump\'s first term, when he stood in front of NATO\'s new
headquarters building and refused to endorse the alliance\'s core
mutual-defense pact unless Europeans raised military spending.

Since then, European outlays have jumped. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth
on his first trip to NATO\'s headquarters recently affirmed America\'s
commitment to the alliance and its core tenet of collective security,
while still admonishing Europeans to spend even more.

The difference now is the administration\'s view of threats from Russia.
Trump and his team are engaging with Russia, siding with Putin and
rejecting traditional U.S. wariness of the Kremlin to a degree
unprecedented since World War II \-- and by some measures since the
founding of the Soviet Union more than a century ago.

Most [European leaders, meanwhile, still see Putin\'s Russia as an
**existential threat.**]{.underline}

A large-scale Russian attack on Europe doesn\'t appear imminent, but the
prospect of an armistice in Ukraine is raising European anxiety. Many of
Washington\'s traditional allies worry that a deal could put Russia in
position to rebuild its battered military, economy and global standing
without simultaneously boosting European security.

A recent survey of almost 400 European international-security
professionals assessing 30 potential high-impact dangers to the EU this
year identified a Ukraine cease-fire favorable to Russia as the gravest
potential threat on the list. The survey was conducted between the U.S.
election and Trump\'s inauguration.

U.S. isolationism and a withdrawal of its security guarantees to Europe
ranked almost on par with a bad Ukraine deal among threats listed \--
and comparable to the danger of a Russian nuclear strike, according to
the study, led by the European University Institute.

\"European worries are confirmed by what we\'ve seen over recent
weeks,\" said survey organizer Veronica Anghel.

[European governments]{.underline} are sprinting belatedly to rebuild
their militaries, [compelled by fear of attack by Russia and abandonment
by the U.S.]{.underline} Leaders of the EU\'s 27 countries will gather
in Brussels on Thursday to hash out plans to boost military spending and
its ability to handle security challenges independently.

One big catch: The [EU isn\'t a military organization]{.underline} and
its work is focused on coordinating members\' efforts while boosting
Europe\'s atrophied, inefficient arms industry.

In terms of military action, [European efforts fit within plans drawn up
at NATO over the past three years,]{.underline} following Russia\'s
large-scale invasion of Ukraine. While European investments will bolster
the continent\'s defenses, they slot into a grand design premised on
American participation. The new European equipment and units are part of
NATO battle plans and command structures.

[Europe has no continentwide military command **outside
NATO.**]{.underline} The U.S. spent decades ensuring that by co-opting
or squelching any effort by allied European governments to create rival
military groupings. Europeans have repeatedly talked about establishing
a multinational fighting force but made little headway.

Now Europeans are pondering what collective defense might look like
without the U.S. Talk of defending Ukraine is focusing European thinking
on how to establish a command structure not built around U.S.
capabilities. The next step would be considering how to defend European
territory without relying on American systems.

\"If you expect Trump will deal transactionally with Europe or disengage
\-- or both \-- you have to prepare for both,\" said Giuseppe Spatafora,
a former NATO planner and now a research analyst at the EU Institute for
Security Studies, the bloc\'s external-policy think tank.

\"How you make up for the U.S. commitment is a political question, and
one that must be discussed and acted upon now,\" said Spatafora.

#### Cooperation over [energy]{.underline} is a [hard sell]{.underline} for NATO.

Post, "Lure of the north: What Russia's Arctic can offer Trump,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/31/russia-arctic-gas-minerals-trump-putin/;
Accessed 7.14.25\]

For Trump, [expansion in the Arctic can be a way to resell **cheap
energy** or buy minerals and rare earth metals from **Russia**, experts
said]{.underline}. [Cooperation with Russia would also be a way to stave
off the growing interest of China, which has **declared
itself**]{.underline} "[a **near-Arctic state**]{.underline}," and is
building its own icebreaking fleet to explore the emerging trade routes.

For Russia, [this presents an opportunity to access the **LNG
technologies** it lacks]{.underline} and revive some of its key revenue
makers, [which have been hindered by **sanctions** since the
**invasion** of **Ukraine**]{.underline}.

"When it comes to Arctic, [Russia has a **lot** **to
offer**]{.underline}," said Russian economist and Arctic expert
Vladislav Inozemtsev. "[It is also something Russia cannot **fully
develop** on its **own**]{.underline}."

All about the gas

A warming climate has unlocked economic opportunities along the Northern
Sea Route, a faster trade lane between Europe and Asia that was once
frozen, and Russia aims to capitalize on this with its unrivaled
icebreaker fleet.

[These Arctic regions are rich in **massive deposits** of natural
gas]{.underline}, with the Bovanenkovo field on the Yamal Peninsula
alone holding approximately 4.9 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves,
rivaling major U.S. fields such as Eagle Ford Shale. Russia had invested
millions in LNG facilities along the northern route --- until Western
sanctions derailed those plans.

In 2019, Russia aimed for 30 percent to 40 percent control of the global
LNG market and hoped to boost production to 70 million tons by 2030.

[But Russia's LNG industry is heavily reliant on **Western technology**
and **equipment**]{.underline}, and it was crippled by the post-invasion
sanctions. By 2024, Russia still had only an 8 percent market share.

Echoing **[Witkoff's idea]{.underline}**, Inozemtsev suggested that
[Trump could strike a deal with Russia by letting the **U**nited
**S**tates have a stake in developing the **LNG projects** in Russia and
then giving them a share of gas to resell to **third
countries**]{.underline}.

[One possible arrangement could see the **U**nited **S**tates acting as
an **intermediary** for Russian gas sales to **Europe**]{.underline},
which after the Ukraine invasion largely weaned itself off Russian gas.

In this scenario, Inozemtsev said, [Trump could push Europe to restart
Russian **pipeline gas imports**]{.underline}, while Moscow, in return,
would compensate the United States with a share of the Arctic liquefied
gas that it could then ship to other countries at a higher profit
margin.

"Russia has lucrative things to offer to the U.S., should the U.S., in
turn, put pressure on Europe," Inozemtsev said. The United States could
fulfill its gas contracts to Europe by selling them reflagged Russian
gas from the pipeline network and then sell its own LNG elsewhere.

There have also been reports of efforts to restart the Nord Stream
pipeline which once brought gas across the Baltic Sea into Europe.

Pushing Europe to reopen sanctioned pipelines, however, [is a **hard
sell** after the continent's painful breakup with Russian gas and oil
after the **invasion**]{.underline}. German Economy Minister Robert
Habeck dismissed the idea of reviving Nord Stream, calling it
"completely the wrong direction," following a recent Financial Times
report about another possible effort. [Similar resistance is likely
across **Europe**, as many countries remain wary of **rekindling**
**ties** with a supplier that has shown **few qualms** about using its
resources for **political ends**]{.underline}.

In his second term, President Donald [Trump has pushed European allies
to commit up to five percent of their gross domestic product to defense
and has signaled that the United States may no longer provide a
conventional military backstop on the continent]{.underline}. Some
suggest that this is a calculated effort to compel Europe to assume
greater responsibility and that the United States will remain committed
to the alliance. Yet even if that is the intent rather than absolute
abandonment, the effect is the same: [Europe would be prudent to plan
for a future without an American security guarantee]{.underline}. What
follows from such a shift is far from predetermined. [One possibility
is]{.underline} that [the shock of American disengagement catalyzes
greater European unity and strategic coherence]{.underline}. [Another is
that the loss of U.S. leadership accelerates internal divisions and
geopolitical vulnerability]{.underline}. Which path Europe takes will
depend on choices made now --- by [policymakers]{.underline} who [should
prepare for contingency, not continuity]{.underline}. In the first
scenario, European [NATO member states]{.underline} respond to a
sustained American withdrawal by [expanding their security capacities
through a range of measures, including the formation of new
partnerships, the enlargement of their armed forces, and the
strengthening of domestic defense industries.]{.underline} Unlike more
ambiguous past episodes, [Washington]{.underline} is now making its
intentions clear through concrete actions --- [systematically
withdrawing from Europe and signaling that it no longer considers the
continent a strategic priority]{.underline} by either de jure or de
facto dismissal of security agreements. In an effort to concentrate on
countering China and driving a wedge between Beijing and Moscow,
[Washington either intensifies cooperation with Moscow or begins clearly
recognizing a Russian sphere of influence in its immediate
neighborhood]{.underline}. These moves send a message that [the
U.S.-European alliance is no longer a U.S. priority, and the United
States is not likely to be positioned to come to Europe's defense in the
event of Russian aggression --- or be willing to do so]{.underline}.
European leaders come to recognize that [their only viable path forward
lies in developing a more unified and strategically coherent security
architecture.]{.underline} In the absence of U.S. leadership, previously
peripheral actors become more central. The United Kingdom, despite no
longer being part of the European Union, takes an important role by
mobilizing support from Commonwealth countries such as Canada and
Australia to contribute to European security initiatives. At the same
time, the United Kingdom maintains close ties with the United States and
increasingly acts as a bridge between the two sides of the Atlantic.
[France leads the initiative to reshape Europe's defense posture, with
Germany]{.underline} --- initially cautious --- [joining as the urgency
of the situation becomes clear]{.underline}. Over time, countries like
Norway, already closely aligned with the European Union, move toward
full membership, further consolidating the European defense framework.
[The European Security Council evolves into a more robust and active
institution, increasingly taking on strategic coordination
responsibilities]{.underline}. To compensate for the loss of the U.S.
nuclear umbrella, [France and the United Kingdom jointly develop a
European nuclear deterrent framework, offering protection to E.U. and
partner states in the new security environment]{.underline}. Although
Europe's overall military capacity remains limited, a [significant
degree of deterrence is achieved through intensified cooperation and an
unprecedented level of political unity]{.underline}. [Major defense
capabilities are developed and strategically positioned, with a
particular focus on bolstering troop presence and military
infrastructure in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe to deter
potential Russian aggression]{.underline}. As confidence in NATO
declines, several European countries reduce their contributions to the
alliance and begin to question its relevance altogether. Some even
consider formally withdrawing or adopting a more passive role, viewing
continued alignment with the United States as a constraint on foreign
policy --- particularly in relation to China. Over time, Western
European states begin reassessing their broader strategic priorities,
seeking to balance multiple global challenges, while Eastern European
countries continue to view Russia as the principal and immediate threat.
Despite occasional disagreements from states such as Hungary and
Slovakia, Europe manages to maintain a degree of cohesion. [This growing
unity fosters the emergence of a distinct European identity in
international affairs, defined by the capacity to pursue independent
strategic objectives]{.underline}. As a result, [Europe increasingly
positions itself as a global power]{.underline}, balancing between the
United States and China, while also independently cultivating
partnerships with emerging actors such as India and various Central
Asian states. This scenario builds on the core premise that Europe's
transformation from a continent of conflict to a liberal success story
was made possible in large part by long-standing U.S. security
guarantees. As in the previous scenarios, the initial response to a U.S.
withdrawal is a concerted European effort to increase defense capacity.
The United Kingdom becomes more deeply engaged in continental security
and shares a leadership role with France, while Germany accelerates its
rearmament and begins to close the capability gap. In the early phase,
this cooperative momentum holds. Faced with the shared urgency of
deterring immediate threats, particularly from Russia, European states
coordinate military investments, intelligence sharing, and regional
force deployments with relatively little friction. Over time, however,
as national capacities grow and the immediate sense of unity fades,
underlying tensions begin to resurface. France --- long invested in
shaping Europe's strategic direction --- grows uneasy about the
prominent role of the United Kingdom, a non-E.U. member, in continental
security affairs. The United Kingdom, for its part, remains committed to
a strong presence in Europe and shows little interest in deferring to
E.U. leadership. Rising militarization, combined with the ascent of
right-wing political forces across the continent, brings renewed focus
to questions of national status, strategic autonomy, and geopolitical
influence. Germany, having rapidly expanded its defense capabilities,
begins to assert that its growing role warrants greater strategic
influence --- particularly in decisions traditionally shaped by
Franco-British leadership. The inclusive and consensus-driven model of
European multilateralism begins to erode, giving way to new patterns of
fragmentation, rivalry, and regional alignment. In this increasingly
competitive environment, European states begin prioritizing bilateral,
interest-driven partnerships --- both among themselves and with external
actors. With multilateral institutions losing coherence, states pursue
transactional arrangements tailored to their own security and strategic
needs. Confronted with prolonged uncertainty and lacking a credible
collective deterrent, some Eastern European countries --- particularly
those geographically vulnerable or politically divided --- may even
adopt a bandwagoning approach by seeking limited accommodation with
Russia. Meanwhile, other states on the periphery, such as Poland, the
Baltic countries, or Finland, strengthen bilateral defense ties with
like-minded partners in an effort to resist Russian influence as much as
possible. Rising uncertainty and deepening divisions bring
long-suppressed historical tensions back to the surface, particularly
territorial disputes and ethnic grievances. In the Balkans, the
unresolved Kosovar--Serbian issue reignites, with Russia openly
supporting Serbian claims and emboldening nationalist elements. Across
Central and Eastern Europe, the resurgence of nationalism prompts
Hungary to pursue a more assertive policy aimed at "protecting
Hungarian-speaking populations" in Romania, Slovakia, and Serbia,
fueling regional friction. Russia intensifies its hybrid operations
across the Baltics, the Balkans, and Moldova, justifying its actions by
invoking the need to defend "Russian-speaking minorities" in these
areas. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Mediterranean, the absence of a robust
deterrent framework encourages Turkey to escalate its involvement in
Cyprus, raising the risk of a direct confrontation with Greece. Whether
Europe moves toward strategic unity or drifts into fragmentation will
depend not only on the trajectory of U.S. disengagement, but also on
Europe's ability to confront internal divisions and respond
pragmatically to a more fluid global order. While the United States has
not fully withdrawn from Europe, its long-term commitment appears
increasingly uncertain. The challenge for Europe is not to replace U.S.
leadership outright, but to build the resilience and internal
coordination needed to manage growing security responsibilities amid
shifting global alignments. Strategic autonomy, even in a limited form,
will likely face considerable headwinds. Europe is internally divided by
geography, threat perception, and political will --- and also
constrained by structural factors. Defense spending remains uneven,
energy dependence is unresolved, and aging populations place pressure on
budgets and manpower alike. The capacity to project power independently
--- especially in nuclear terms --- remains far below that of the United
States or Russia. In light of these realities, near-term efforts may
center more on practical coordination. Joint procurement in key areas
such as missile defense, cyber capabilities, and logistics may offer
more immediate gains. Enhanced interoperability among command
structures, particularly across eastern and western members, could
reduce duplication and build trust incrementally. A loose leadership
framework --- anchored in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom ---
may serve as a useful starting point, especially if it includes
participation from Poland, Italy, and the Nordics. Externally, Europe
will likely continue to hedge. Deeper partnerships with Japan,
Australia, ASEAN, and others could help reduce exposure to
overdependence on any one actor, particularly China. The relationship
with Turkey will remain complicated, yet strategically indispensable,
especially given its position as a NATO ally and its independent
regional posture. The path toward autonomy will not be quick or
comprehensive. It will be shaped less by quick solutions than by
incremental adaptation, flexible coalitions, and shared burdens where
feasible. Europe's ability to coordinate within these constraints may
determine not only the future of its unity --- but its relevance in a
world of dispersed power and conditional alignments.

The Arctic's importance for NATO

[Strengthening [Russia\'s operative possibilities in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}\'s melting areas also [merges with Canadian and American
security problems.]{.mark} Russian submarines operating, for example in
the Beaufort Sea, equipped with offensive missiles will **[pose a
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} not only [to Canada, but even
to]{.underline} the central states of [the US.
[With]{.mark}]{.underline} the deployment of [[Russian forces]{.mark} in
the Arctic, [NATO's security]{.mark} approach and responses
[require]{.mark}d **[reconsideration]{.mark}** as US military assets in
Greenland (Thule), Iceland (Naval Air Station in Keflavik), and Northern
Europe (Bodø air station) are currently more under threat.]{.underline}
If there were a full spectrum of operationality in the Arctic, with a
tracking field which is inevitable in anti-missile systems, then the
Western defensive systems would symmetrically balance an increasing
threat. But, in this case, the deployment of [new Russian
missiles]{.underline} to the Artic drastically [shortens the response
time in North America]{.underline} without falling within the classic
range of alarms and defence measures. In July 2021, the Russian armed
forces tested the Zircon hypersonic guided missile by launching it from
a frigate in the White Sea with the missiles flying across the Kola
Peninsula to a target approximately three hundred fifty kilometres away
in the Barents Sea. The distance of this test is not impressive, but it
indicates the probable direction of this technology's development. 44

Analysing Russia\'s ambitions towards tactical planning and NATO
strategy, the Kremlin pressures two regional bottlenecks, the GIUK-N gap
and the Svalbard archipelago. It is worth adding that [Norway had
extended its sovereignty over Svalbard by the Treaty of
1920]{.underline} (implemented in 1925), however [the stationing of
armed forces there is prohibited,]{.underline} as is the use of the
archipelago for "war purposes."45 Svalbard is an ideal area to place air
defence systems, and moreover the risk is that [[Russian
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} could land on Bear Island to deploy sea and
air defence forces there. As it is located approximately halfway between
mainland Norway and the main islands of the Svalbard archipelago, such
an intervention [**[would hamper]{.mark}** the [**movement and
operation** of NATO forces in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Note that such a scenario is unlikely, but realistic. However, by
invading Svalbard, Russia would increase its operational scope in the
area, improving access to its waters and enhancing the security of the
Northern Fleet. 46

This [[region is also]{.mark} of direct importance for
[guarantee]{.mark}ing **[f]{.mark}**reedom **[o]{.mark}**f
**[n]{.mark}**avigation]{.underline}. 47 [This is a **[critical aspect
of the alliance,]{.mark}** especially in securing logistics and
supplies]{.underline} from North America in case of potential arenas of
operations in Europe. Securing Transatlantic underwater
telecommunications cables48 also influences this picture. However, when
analysing the potential of the High North, it is [unsurprising that
[Russia\'s goal is to exercise control in]{.mark} its [EEZ and]{.mark}
strive to [expand]{.mark} systematically the **[scope of its
influence.]{.mark}**]{.underline}49 Thus, in a conceivable case of
conflict-escalation, it is likely optimal for the Russian command to
direct the arena of operations towards the North Atlantic, distant from
its territorial waters. 50 However, analysing capabilities and threat
awareness should not be equated with overestimating Russian capacities,
Despite its potential, Russia does not currently have air superiority to
conduct long-range interdiction operations in the North Atlantic.

WASHINGTON -- The [latest]{.underline} U.S.-Iran [crisis]{.underline}
has [brought a **hoary issue** back to the center]{.underline} [of the
**foreign policy debate**]{.underline}: [the question of
**credibility**]{.underline}. Pundits have argued about whether the
killing of Iran's savviest military commander, Qassem Soleimani, will
strengthen America's reputation for forcefully defending its interests,
and whether U.S. President Donald Trump's prior restraint in the face of
military provocations had invited Iran to act more boldly.

If the arguments seem familiar, that's because [**similar debates**
erupted during the Syria]{.underline} ["**red line**" incident of
2013]{.underline}, when U.S. President Barack Obama retreated from his
threat to strike Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces if they used
chemical weapons against civilians. In fact, [concerns about credibility
go]{.underline} back [to the beginning of America's career]{.underline}
[as a **superpower**]{.underline}. And [while the **credibility
debate**]{.underline} has often [pitted **policymakers**
against]{.underline} [**academics**, recent scholarship]{.underline} has
[helped bridge that divide by clarifying **when and how**]{.underline}
[credibility]{.underline} really [matters]{.underline}.

The foreign policy community has long been obsessed with credibility,
for good reason. Credibility --- the perception that a country will
defend its interests and uphold its commitments when challenged --- is
the coin of the realm for a global superpower. If U.S. credibility is
strong, then it will not have to use force often, because other
countries will recognize that attacking its interests and its global
network of allies will invite sharp retaliation. A [credible superpower
has little trouble **attracting** and **retaining** allies]{.underline}.
[Yet if]{.underline} [America's credibility is **weak**]{.underline},
aggressors will be more likely to test U.S. power, and
[allies]{.underline} [will be **unnerved**]{.underline}.

It is no exaggeration to say that [American global
influence]{.underline} and the stability of the international system
[rest on the **credibility** of U.S. **threats** and
**promises**]{.underline}. For better or worse, [the U.S.
has]{.underline} even [fought major wars in **out-of-the-way
places**]{.underline} such as Korea and Vietnam in large part [to
**convince** allies]{.underline} and adversaries that [it is willing to
fight in more critical places]{.underline}, such as Europe.

Foreign-policy [academics have taken a]{.underline} more [**conflicted
view** of credibility]{.underline}. A first wave of scholarship emerged
in the 1960s, with the future Nobel Prize winner in economics Thomas
Schelling at its crest. [Schelling saw]{.underline} U.S. [commitments as
a **seamless global web**]{.underline}. In a contest against the Soviet
Union, [the way in which America responded to]{.underline}
[challenges]{.underline} anywhere [would affect how **other players**
gauged its willingness]{.underline} to respond to aggression everywhere.
"We lost 30,000 dead in Korea to save face for the United States and the
United Nations, not to save South Korea for the South Koreans, and it
was undoubtedly worth it," Schelling wrote.

Yet the fixation with credibility also brought strategic disasters such
as Vietnam. So there subsequently emerged [a second wave of
scholarship]{.underline}, which [held that **past behavior**
was]{.underline} [irrelevant to whether adversaries **chose to
challenge**]{.underline}. [Other variables, such as the]{.underline}
[**balance of power** and]{.underline} the [**importance** of the
interests]{.underline} at stake, [were what mattered]{.underline}. As
one scholar put it, "Credibility is an illusion --- and an exceptionally
dangerous one at that."

[This position was]{.underline} always a bit of [a **head-scratcher**,
because it required accepting that what a country does today has **no
impact** on what others expect]{.underline} it will do
**[tomorrow]{.underline}**. Fortunately, a [third wave of
scholarship]{.underline} has now [knocked down the **more extreme
academic critiques**, without obscuring **important nuances** in how
credibility actually works]{.underline}.

Cold War historians have suggested that [U.S. intervention in **Korea**,
which Soviet leader]{.underline} [Josef **Stalin** had not expected, did
**strongly influence** his views of whether Washington]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} also [resist]{.underline} blatant communist
[**military provocations** elsewhere]{.underline}. We now know that John
F. [Kennedy's]{.underline} perceived [weakness in handling the botched
**Bay of Pigs invasion**]{.underline} in 1961 [encouraged Soviet
leader]{.underline} Nikita [**Khrushchev** to think he could bully
the]{.underline} young [U.S.]{.underline} president [by trying to evict
Western forces from **Berlin** and]{.underline} secretly [**shipping**
nuclear]{.underline} [missiles]{.underline} to Cuba.

Looking beyond the Cold War context, America's relatively timid
responses to al-Qaida attacks during the 1990s encouraged Osama bin
Laden to think that a major strike on the U.S. homeland might drive
Washington out of the Middle East altogether. Likewise, a [number of
**political science studies**, many]{.underline} of them [using
statistical methods to **divine** broad trends, demonstrate]{.underline}
that [states that honor their **commitments**]{.underline} and meet
challenges head-on [are **more likely to win** allies]{.underline} and
deter future challenges.

Why does any of this matter? For one thing, it shows that [it is foolish
to brush off]{.underline} [concerns about credibility]{.underline}, as
Obama did in remarking that "dropping bombs on someone to prove that
you're willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason
to use force." Especially [in cases where the U.S. is **interacting**
repeatedly with a **single challenger**, or]{.underline} where [its
**reaction** to one challenge might **reasonably be expected** to
yield]{.underline} [clues about its **reaction** to a
similar]{.underline} type of [provocation]{.underline} in the future,
[you can bet]{.underline} that [Washington's choices]{.underline} will
[shape **global views** of its credibility and resolve]{.underline}.

It seems almost certain that Trump's reticence in using force against
Iran through nearly all of 2019 influenced Tehran's willingness to
gradually increase the military pressure --- and so it's plausible that
killing Soleimani may throw a wrench in the calculations of Iran or
other Middle Eastern actors who are tempted to use force against
American interests.

But don't get carried away. Second-wave scholarship reminds us that
**[context matters]{.underline}**: [The fact that the U.S. doesn't use
force to punish **humanitarian outrages** or protect a]{.underline}
[**non-treaty ally** in one region doesn't]{.underline} necessarily
[have much impact on **expectations** of]{.underline} [whether it will
defend treaty allies]{.underline} from invasion in another region.

The [situations]{.underline} just [aren't the **same**,
because]{.underline} U.S. [security **interests** and
**concerns**]{.underline} about prestige [are]{.underline} so [much more
intense in the latter case]{.underline} than the former. To use a
historical analogy, the Soviets believed that the U.S. withdrawal from
Vietnam signaled a declining American willingness to contest communist
gains in the Third World. They didn't think that Washington would remain
passive in the face of a Warsaw Pact assault on the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

Similarly, it is a stretch to suggest that U.S. inaction in Syria in
2013 tempted Putin to annex Crimea the following year. After all, the
U.S. never had a treaty commitment to defend Ukraine, and local factors
--- namely, Putin's nightmare of losing Ukraine to the West --- surely
overrode all other considerations.

Finally, credibility isn't everything. If killing Soleimani convinces
Iran that the U.S. means business, that's good. But if it gets the U.S.
thrown out of Iraq (thereby weakening its position against Tehran) or
forces Washington to commit far more resources to the Gulf (thereby
weakening its position against China), what has America really gained?

The [debates **surrounding credibility** are complex]{.underline}. The
good news is that this is a case in which [recent academic work can
help]{.underline} U.S. [officials make sense of the **complexity**
and]{.underline} [avoid]{.underline} the [**mistakes** that come with
either **undervaluing** or **overvaluing** credibility]{.underline}. For
policymakers, the scariest words in the English language need not be,
"I'm from academia, and I'm here to help."

[Connections between US Alliances in Europe and East Asia]{.underline}
may not be apparent at first glance, but they do exist and can [have a
**meaningful impact** on the strategic calculations of US Allies in each
region]{.underline}---and even on the United States itself. [When new
developments create uncertainty about US policy, with]{.underline}
potential [implications for the **U**nited **S**tates' reputation **as
an Ally**]{.underline} or the allocation of US military resources, the
**[Allies pay close attention to]{.underline}** situations in **[distant
regions]{.underline}**.

Moreover, [as the **U**nited **S**tates prepares for global
competition]{.underline} with China, [Washington has been paving the
road for **interregional coop**eration]{.underline} between US Allies.
For example, a recent expert group report to the NATO secretary general
argues China is "best understood as a full-spectrum systemic rival,
rather than a purely economic player or an only Asia-focused security
actor," and asserts "NATO must devote much more time, political
resources and action to the security challenges posed by China."31

Two somewhat contradictory interregional connections are particularly
important for US Alliances. First, US [Allies in both regions are
affected by the reputation of the **U**nited **S**tates as a **military
protector**]{.underline}.32 [Insofar as **rep**utation is a global
commodity, **all**]{.underline} US [**Allies** have reasons to support
the reputation of the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}---the
[**cred**ibility]{.underline} of US extended deterrence **[helps
guarantee their own security]{.underline}**. Yet [US military
resources]{.underline}, including policymakers' attention, [are limited,
resulting in an **inevitable trade-off** between]{.underline} what the
United States can commit to in [East Asia and in Europe]{.underline}.

[Recent scholarship]{.underline} has [questioned]{.underline} aspects of
[deterrence theory and]{.underline} instead [suggests]{.underline} that
bac[king down in one confrontation does not lead an adversary to regard
a state as irresolute]{.underline}, or increase the likelihood of
further challenges. [Authors such as]{.underline} Daryl [Press
and]{.underline} Jonathan [Mercer]{.underline} have [argued that in
assessing a state\'s level of resolve, an **adversary** is more likely
to consider that state\'s current]{.underline} interests and
[capabilities, rather than]{.underline} its [past actions]{.underline}.2
For interactions with adversaries, recent scholarship concludes that
credible threats require significant interests and the capabilities
necessary to pursue or protect them. [However, there has been **less
academic focus** on another aspect]{.underline} of international
relations - [how a state might assess the security reliability of an
**ally**]{.underline}.

Some authors have argued that states should not worry about whether
allies consider them reliable. Mercer suggests that because
\'Decision-makers do not consistently use another state\'s past
behaviour\...to predict that state\'s behavior\', the United States
should not be concerned about its allies viewing it as irresolute, as
these allies will simply assume that America\'s \'interests and
capabilities determine \[its\] resolve\'.3 Although Press largely
supports Mercer\'s conclusions about adversaries and resolve, he is more
reserved on how allies might assess a state\'s actions. Press notes that
although \'it is critical to know how countries assess the credibility
of their allies,\' this remains a research gap.4

The issue of reliability within alliances is not a completely unexplored
field, but most of the scholarly work focussing on alliance reliability
has examined its connection to alliance formation and termination.
Douglas Gibler looks primarily at the issue of alliance foimation, but
also finds that states with reliable allies are less likely to be
targeted in disputes.5 Gregory Miller finds that unreliable states will
be more constrained by the design of their alliances---allies will
impose tighter alliance controls to compensate for any
unreliability---but it is less clear how this finding assists in
understanding alliance management in situations where the simple
rewriting of an alliance treaty might not be practical.6 For example, it
is hard to conceive how Japan, if it began to doubt American reliability
today, could simply rewrite its alliance with the United States in order
to mitigate the risk of abandonment Brett Leeds has considered the
reliability of alliance commitments in times of war, but the subject of
reliability perceptions within non-wartime alliance management is
relatively unexamined.7

conduct of their ally and that these observations can influence that
state to adopt balancing behaviour intended to mitigate the risks posed
by the ally\'s unreliability.]{.underline} I argue that [the \"alliance

In the contemporary context, this quite literally means that pursuing a
grand strategy that seeks to place 'America First' at the heart of U.S.
statecraft should prize nonproliferation. Most importantly, [allied
proliferation complicates America's ability to exercise its hard power,
**limiting the privileges of primacy**]{.underline} that
[Trump]{.underline} so [relishes]{.underline}.

First, in practical terms, [allies]{.underline} today [that consider
building their own nuclear arsenals need to contend with]{.underline}
the [strategic and technical barriers]{.underline} to actually doing so.
[Ukraine, Poland, South Korea, and]{.underline} even
[Taiwan]{.underline} all [would face the potential]{.underline} of an
explicit [renunciation of U.S.]{.underline} protection or
[assurances]{.underline} if they chose to pursue nuclear weapons. While
some in these states may argue this is today's status quo with the Trump
administration's approach to alliances, [they would face]{.underline}
the problem of [**vulnerability to attack** as they sought to build the
bomb. Reprocessing and enrichment facilities will be hardly
invulnerable]{.underline} to attack, and their adversaries --- [Russia,
China, and North Korea]{.underline} --- will [have ample incentive to
consider **sabotage, conventional air strikes, or worse**. Russian,
Chinese, or North Korean attempts to kill our proliferation-curious
allies]{.underline} to stop them from getting there [could **drag us
into a major conflict**]{.underline}, as [they would]{.underline}
certainly [threaten the stability of the **global economy**]{.underline}
and thus American interests.

Second, [even with friendly countries that might]{.underline}
successfully [proliferate, the actions they take after]{.underline}
acquiring nuclear weapons [may **force Washington to intervene in
crises** or wars against its own interests]{.underline}. For instance,
[an ally may force a U.S. president to]{.underline} step in and
[prevent]{.underline} dangerous [nuclear signaling or
**use**]{.underline}, as has been the case in the past with the United
Kingdom, France, and Israel in 1956; Israel in 1973; and India and
Pakistan after 1998.

[A newly emboldened]{.underline} but still weaker [nuclear-armed
ally]{.underline} or partner [may]{.underline} try to [**provoke a major
U.S. adversary**, pulling the **U**nited **S**tates into a
crisis]{.underline} as a mediator, or worse. [With more nuclear-armed
states, the **intersection of crises** that]{.underline} may [implicate
U.S. interests with nuclear weapons uncontrolled by Washington becomes
**far more likely**. In a world of reduced U.S. influence on multiple,
**skittish new nuclear decision-making centers** in **Asia, the Middle
East, Africa, or elsewhere**, states are **less likely to consider
Washington's opinion** before engaging in nuclear
threat-making]{.underline} --- **[or use]{.underline}** --- [to address
local grievances]{.underline} or right historical wrongs.

This would hardly serve an 'America First' world. The potential for
metastasizing nuclear crises assuredly contradict the goal of the
"strategic prioritization" that former and incoming officials support.

In addition to diminishing American power, further [proliferation
anywhere]{.underline} --- [especially by]{.underline} prosperous,
democratic [allies]{.underline} of the United States, like South Korea
--- [is likely to **beget**]{.underline} further **[proliferation
everywhere]{.underline}**. While some U.S. officials may be comfortable
with a nuclear [South Korea]{.underline}, they should ask whether they
are comfortable with all that may follow in total --- such as [Japan,
Taiwan, Poland, Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, all supporters of today's
nonproliferation regime. [Should this dam break, the **U**nited
**S**tates' relative power and influence **stands to
decline**]{.underline}. And [Trump's dreams of a
denuclearization]{.underline} pact [with Russia and China will be
**completely out of reach**]{.underline} in a world where multiple new
nuclear aspirants emerge. Keeping 'America First' in that world becomes
a lot more challenging. Keeping nuclear use from occurring, and
potentially embroiling the United States, an ally, or other economic
partner in a conflict, becomes much more unpredictable.

The history of nuclear proliferation suggests that [any decisions to
shelter or encourage allied proliferation are **likely to be
permanent**]{.underline}. With the exception of South Africa, no other
state --- not even Ukraine, which never had control over the weapons on
its territory --- has ever relinquished its nuclear weapons. Despite the
remarkable success of the United States in leading nonproliferation
efforts worldwide, **[the proliferation genie does not easily reenter
its bottle]{.underline}**. The [acquisition]{.underline} of nuclear
weapons [is a lasting mark on international politics, and America's
freedom to maneuver]{.underline}, even if by "friendly states."

Compared to these potential costs, the administration should tread
carefully as it seeks to revise longstanding compacts with its treaty
allies around the world. While Trump reels at the peacetime costs of
sustaining forward-deployed conventional forces in Europe and Asia,
seeing them as evidence of the United States being taken for a ride, the
alternatives could be far more costly to the United States.
[**Unleashing a cascade of nuclear prolif**eration]{.underline}, or
rebuilding American economic strength in the aftermath of nuclear
conflicts, **[would be far more expensive than sustaining the U.S.
extended deterrence approach]{.underline}**.

The surest way for the "crazy" power of nuclear weapons to boomerang
back at the United States --- constraining our freedom of action and
potentially chain-ganging us into conflicts we seek to avoid --- is for
Washington to actively dismantle the extended nuclear deterrence
architecture it so carefully crafted over three-quarters of a century,
which managed to keep new allies from getting the bomb. In addition to
reinstalling the software of extended deterrence, in order to prevent
allied proliferation, the United States may have to make adjustments to
the size or composition of its own deployed nuclear force posture. This
will ensure that its hardware remains credible for deterrence, as well
as assurance --- some degree of vertical proliferation may be necessary
to stanch the threat of horizontal proliferation, an oft lost point.

The post-Cold War conflation of nuclear nonproliferation with the
so-called liberal order was understandable given the geopolitical
context of the 1990s, but for the United States, is largely ahistorical.
[If Trump wants to pursue a grand strategic project with the goal of
keeping]{.underline} ['America First]{.underline}', **[nuclear
nonproliferation]{.underline}** --- not just by adversaries but also by
allies --- **[is an essential pillar]{.underline}**.

Amid these volatile developments, a number of nonnuclear
states---including, for the first time this century, [Washington's own
allies]{.underline}---[are contemplating]{.underline} developing their
own [nuclear arsenals]{.underline}. For decades, a key pillar of
American nuclear strategy has been extending the U.S. nuclear deterrent
to at least 34 formal allies across two vast oceans, a responsibility no
other power assumes. This policy was born not out of altruism but out of
self-interest: [the **U**nited **S**tates and its collective deterrent
are stronger with the geography, capabilities, and political unity that
allies provide. **Fewer nuclear powers means fewer opportunities for
nuclear use**]{.underline}, a goal that has also allowed Washington to
centralize alliance decision-making under its command.

[With]{.underline} the [rapid changes in]{.underline} both [the global
nuclear environment and U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}, however, some
American allies have begun to question Washington's ability and
willingness to extend deterrence. **[South
Korea]{.underline}**---anxious about American
abandonment---[is]{.underline} now [most likely to engage in nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}, although some [**NATO** powers
could]{.underline} also [be candidates]{.underline}. In Europe, [the
United Kingdom's and France's nuclear arsenals]{.underline} can
compensate to some degree for reduced U.S. engagement. But these forces,
even combined with additional nonnuclear capabilities, [are not
positioned to limit the damage]{.underline} that [Russia can
cause]{.underline} to allies and thus cannot credibly replace the
nuclear umbrella offered by the United States. As a result, countries
such as [**Poland** or]{.underline} even [**Germany** could decide to
seek their own nuclear weapons if]{.underline} they become
[convinced]{.underline} that [the **U**nited **S**tates is no longer
willing or able to protect them]{.underline}.

[The advent of more nuclear powers]{.underline}, regardless of whether
they are U.S. allies, [would open a **Pandora's box** that Washington
has fought for decades to keep closed]{.underline}. For one thing, the
same nuclear powers these countries are seeking to deter---[China,
Russia, and North Korea]{.underline}---[could]{.underline} decide to
[wipe out any emerging nuclear programs in a preventive
attack]{.underline}. And even if [a U.S. ally]{.underline} succeeds in
acquiring nuclear weapons, its small arsenal [would become vulnerable to
more powerful adversaries as U.S. security guarantees fade, **leading to
growing instability**]{.underline}. Consider South Asia, where India and
Pakistan continue to engage in increasingly intense conventional strikes
despite the ever-present threat of nuclear use, [testing the limits of
the]{.underline} so-called **[stability-instability
paradox]{.underline}**, wherein the existence of [nuclear stability
between two countries may]{.underline} actually **[increase the
likelihood of conventional conflict]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[if one
U.S. ally]{.underline}**---say, South Korea---**[developed nuclear
weapons, it would]{.underline}** likely **[encourage
others]{.underline}**, such as Japan[**, to quickly follow suit**. This
would deliver a damaging blow to an already fragile Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, which has]{.underline} for decades [served as a
**crucial brake** on the spread of nuclear weapons. Keeping allies
nonnuclear and preserving the treaty are core American
interests]{.underline}---if nothing else, [to **prevent other states
from starting, and dragging Washington into, nuclear wars** that **the
U**nited **S**tates **has to finish**]{.underline}.

In sum, [any use of nuclear weapons by miscalculation and malicious
intentions can cause a **catastrophic disaster**]{.underline} for human
society, the economy, and the environment. Therefore, **[nuclear weapons
cannot bring world peace]{.underline}** for five reasons. First, [only
rational and predictable behavior can make nuclear deterrence
work]{.underline}, however, **[this is not the way people work,
especially during warfare]{.underline}**. Second, from the historical
narrative, since 1945, [nuclear weapons do not play a significant role
in preventing military conflicts]{.underline} (such as aggressing
against states with nuclear weapons) [and bringing positive
peace]{.underline}. Third, [instead of making]{.underline} the
[conflicts better, nuclear weapons **make them worse**]{.underline}. For
example, the Russia-[Ukraine]{.underline} war [shows how **states with
nuclear weapons**]{.underline} (Russia) **[threaten the states with no
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** (Ukraine), **[and constrain their
capacities to respond]{.underline}**. Fourth, [nuclear deterrence makes
the use of nuclear weapons **become possible**]{.underline}, because
[states]{.underline} with nuclear weapons **[always prepare to
launch]{.underline}** nuclear weapons. At last, nowadays, there are
[many factors]{.underline} that can [threaten world peace, such as
**terrorism, climate change, poverty, cyber-attacks**, and **human
trafficking**]{.underline}. Although stopping these activities is a
national security priority for most states, [it is not
reasonable]{.underline} for them [to use nuclear weapons to deter these
threats]{.underline} or to compel the states engaged in them to stop. In
a nutshell, [nuclear weapons **cannot be used to solve such security
issue**s]{.underline}. In fact, [these risks can **reinforce** the
**instability** in the world]{.underline} in turn. For instance,
[**cyber-attacks** can manipulate national leaders to launch nuclear
strikes due to misinformation or **miscalc**ulation]{.underline}.
Therefore, eliminating nuclear weapons can remove potential collateral
risks, and eventually bring the world positive peace.

#### Every argument for proliferation is [debunked]{.underline} by history and logic.

There were two opposing theories regarding the issues of nuclear
proliferation and non-proliferation. Some IR scholars refused to
acknowledge the theory that nuclear proliferation would increase the
possibility of nuclear conflict. Waltz claims to adhere to "more may be
better", and "rational deterrence theory", he claims that the spread of
nuclear weapons would bring stability and peace to the international or
regional order since nuclear proliferation would be deterred from
attacking each other by the risk of nuclear retaliation, which is
adopted by North Korea in defense of its nuclear program. Moreover,
[Waltz claimed]{.underline} that [nuclear deterrence is a form of peace
that most states can acquire by possessing nuclear weapons]{.underline}
(Waltz, 1990). Waltz argues that in an anarchic state, it is important
to protect the sovereignty and national security, especially in the
nuclear era. Therefore, nuclear deterrence is necessary for states
living under the threat of a nuclear rival. However, others claimed that
nuclear weapons unavoidably increase the risk of a catastrophic nuclear
explosion. For instance, Scott Sagan's "Organizational Theory" was used
against nuclear proliferation. He argued that the behavior of the state
and military are different. For instance, unlike the military going to
war merely for victory, states aimed at gaining broader political
interests. In other words, for the military, defeating the enemy even by
a small margin still could be regarded as a victory (Sagan, 1994).
Therefore, the military would be considered using nuclear weapons if
they were not controlled by the states.

However, the argument is that [Waltz's idea about using nuclear peace as
justification for nuclear proliferation **ignored the actual reasons for
the general peace**]{.underline}. After World War II, [it
was]{.underline} the notion of **[collective security and Democratic
Peace Theory]{.underline}** (Rosato, 2003), **[rather than the nuclear
peace theory that brought peace to the world order]{.underline}**. Also,
the opposing argument for Waltz's assertion "more may be better (Waltz,
2013)" for [nuclear proliferation]{.underline} is that he [did not take
the situation]{.underline}---"**[less rational actors take control of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**" into consideration, [**such as
terrorists**. As non-state actors, terrorists lack restrictions and
cannot be deterred]{.underline} by state-based means. For instance, as a
nuclear state, although [Pakistan]{.underline} confronted a
nuclear-armed India, and had reasons to acquire nuclear weapons, it [had
not increased international security and peace]{.underline} as Waltz
claimed. On the contrary, [with the collapse of its internal security,
terrorism became normalized]{.underline} in Pakistan.
[Although]{.underline} the [nuclear capacity can guarantee]{.underline}
its [survival, the threat]{.underline} of nuclear weapons largely
**[impedes]{.underline}** the **[long-term security]{.underline}** of
the region in turn, as well as can destroy innocent neighboring states.

Moreover, for non-nuclear proliferation advocates, [nuclear deterrence
is **not a stable way for states to protect themselves**]{.underline}
from gaining nuclear weapons (Mearsheimer, 1993). However, the
deterrence strategy has two limitations. Firstly, if both Iraq and
Israel possessed nuclear weapons, there would not be enhanced peace in
the Middle East, nor would the peace and stability of the Korean
peninsula if North Korea and South Korea were nuclear proliferation
states, and if they were involved in the regional conflicts to gain more
warheads and missiles than their rivals. In addition, [the Cold War was
not a period of peace bu]{.underline}t a period of [intensified
aggression and]{.underline} the [fear]{.underline} of the possibility of
a holocaust of nuclear proliferation. Amounts of [historical evidence
showed]{.underline} that [keeping nuclear weapons can **barely prevent a
state from attacking** another]{.underline} (Sagan, 1996). For instance,
[the U.S.'s]{.underline} nuclear weapons [did not deter Chinese armies
from attacking its forces at Yalu River, Britain's]{.underline} nuclear
weapons [did not stop Argentina from invading the Falkland Islands, and
Israel's]{.underline} nuclear weapons [did not stop Egypt from
attacking]{.underline} in 1973 (Blechman & Hart, 1982). Also, the
Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969 over the Ussuri River and China
invading Vietnam (a client state of the USSR) in 1979 showed that human
error and fear of the possibility of nuclear proliferation did not deter
a state from invading another.

Secondly, although there is no doubt that nuclear weapons can bring an
effective deterrence to some conflicts, as long as warring parties act
rationally, their military capabilities will have checks and balances,
[there is **no proof**]{.underline} that [nuclear deterrence can realize
lasting peace, stability, and security]{.underline}. In other words, the
[nuclear deterrence]{.underline} theory [can only be realized under
certain preconditions, such as]{.underline} the
[rationality]{.underline} of political actors, [the difference between
deterrence and compellence, and the pursuit of national
objectives]{.underline} rather than the supposedly unchallengeable
nature of the international system. However, in a self-help
international system, it is impossible that nuclear weapons can become a
dependable preserver of peace and stability. In fact, **[the more
nuclear-armed states, the more potential conflicts will
be]{.underline}**. According to deterrence theory, [deterrence is
most]{.underline} likely to be [effective when attackers
suppose]{.underline} that [the probability of success is low and the
costs of attack are high]{.underline} (Werner, 2000). However, on one
hand, if developing states that lay on the periphery of the balance of
power between the two powers [with nuclear proliferation]{.underline},
possessed nuclear capability, the original **[balance]{.underline}** of
power **[would be broken]{.underline}**, and the deterrence system would
be threatened. On the other hand, [if states with volatile border
disputes have the ability to attack]{.underline} other states [with
nuclear weapons, **the likelihood of nuclear wars would be
increased**]{.underline}. For instance, In 1964, China carried out its
first nuclear test, which theoretically gave China a deterrent
capability. However, its nuclear weapons systems left much to be
desired, such as the uncertain reliability of missiles, and lack of the
range to strike the targets in the USSR.

In addition, the Kargil War can be viewed as a counterexample of the
Democratic Peace Theory and successful nuclear deterrence. India and
Pakistan have become nuclear powers since they successfully tested their
nuclear weapons in 1998. Thereby, some people believe that nuclear
deterrence can reduce the possibility of military conflicts between
India and Pakistan, and bring stability and peace to the region. In
other words, the presence of nuclear weapons can avoid war between these
two states and achieve their political objectives peacefully. Based on
the experience that nuclear deterrence between the U.S. and the USSR
during the Cold War, many hold the optimistic attitude that nuclear war
far outweighs its benefit and can effectively reduce the tensions
between nuclear powers. Also, the Lahore Declaration included nuclear
and non-nuclear Confidence Building Measures that were signed between
India and Pakistan further promote such optimism. Therefore, [advocates
of nuclear deterrence are **surprised by Kargil War**]{.underline}
between India and Pakistan, [which challenged]{.underline} the [nuclear
deterrence theory]{.underline} based on the Cold War experience. The
fact is that the [nuclear weapons canceled out the advantage of India in
conventional war from the perspective of Pakistan]{.underline}. In other
words, [it deters India from retaliating against Pakistan's invasion of
Kashmir]{.underline}. Hence, [Kargil War shows]{.underline} that
**[stability at the strategic level can cause instability at the
tactical level]{.underline}**, and the conflicts-prone nature of the
India-Pakistan relationship can have a qualitative change in a nuclear
environment. Also, the Democratic Peace Theory was proposed by Kant and
Doyle, who argue that democratic states do not fight each other when
they have conflicts, instead, democrats tend to settle peacefully
through negotiation and dialogue. However, even though both India and
Pakistan were being ruled by democratically elected leaders during the
Kargil War, the war still happened because Pakistan's army takes an
essential position in its domestic and foreign affairs since its
independence, even if its civilian government controls affairs.

The concept of [negative peace is particularly relevant]{.underline} to
the nuclear relationship between [India and Pakistan]{.underline}, where
nuclear deterrence has prevented full-scale war but has not fostered
meaningful reconciliation. While both nations [have engaged in
low-intensity conflicts]{.underline}, such as the Kargil War (1999) and
the 2019 Balakot air-strikes, [nuclear weapons]{.underline} have [acted
as a restraining factor]{.underline}, ensuring that hostilities remain
below the threshold of total war. [However, this deterrence has **not
eliminated tensions**]{.underline}; instead, [it has led to a
**stability-instability paradox**, where limited conflicts, proxy wars,
and cross-border skirmishes continue]{.underline} under the nuclear
umbrella. Moreover, [the region experiences **recurring
crises**]{.underline}, such as the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the
Pulwama-Balakot crisis (2019), demonstrating how peace remains fragile
and crisis-prone. Unlike other historical rivalries that have
transitioned to positive peace through economic and diplomatic
cooperation, [India and Pakistan remain locked in militarized
deterrence, political distrust, and minimal cross-border
engagement]{.underline}. This fragile balance highlights how nuclear
deterrence can maintain negative peace by preventing large-scale war
while allowing for ongoing tensions, conflicts, and hostilities that
make true stability elusive.

At last, [Waltz did not consider the character of the
regime]{.underline}. For instance, [compare with mixed regime dyads,
jointly autocratic dyads]{.underline} (Wright & Diehl, 2016) [are more
likely to stay away from the escalation of militarization that may cause
the use of nuclear weapons, and tend to end up with stalemate or
negotiate outcomes and bring the negative peace]{.underline}, such as
the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969.

[Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered three
significant shifts in Russia's Arctic policy]{.underline}: [economic
disruptions as a result of **Western sanctions**]{.underline},
[increased **militarisation**]{.underline}, and a strategic pivot
towards Asia.

First, Western sanctions devastated Russia's Arctic energy sector.
Companies like ExxonMobil and BP withdrew from Russian projects,
disrupting key oil and gas developments. Sanctions also restricted
Russia's access to Western technology, slowing energy extraction
efforts. In response, Russia has sought new partnerships with China,
which has expressed growing interest in Arctic investments. However,
Chinese technology cannot fully replace Western expertise, and this
creates challenges for Russia's Arctic ambitions.

The Ukraine war has shifted priorities towards security and military
dominance, with economic and environmental concerns becoming secondary.

The future of Russia's Arctic strategy

Russia's Arctic strategy has traditionally balanced economic ambitions
with military and geopolitical considerations. However, the Ukraine war
has forced a recalibration: militarisation and reliance on Asian
partnerships now define Moscow's Arctic approach.

[The long-term success of Russia's Arctic ambitions depends on **several
factors**]{.underline}. Can Russia sustain its Arctic economy without
Western investment and technology? Can China and other Asian partners
fill the gap left by Western companies? [How will NATO's Arctic presence
shape Russia's **security policies**]{.underline}? These questions will
determine whether Moscow can maintain its leadership in the region.

With Donald Trump's return to the White House, Russia's Arctic strategy
may have to grapple with new geopolitical dynamics. [Trump's past
foreign policy favoured **bilateral deals** over **multilateral
alliances**]{.underline}. [This could lead to a **loosening** of US
**Arctic commitments** and, potentially, make room for limited
**US-Russia cooperation** in energy and trade]{.underline}. However, [if
Trump maintains his **scepticism** toward **NATO**]{.underline}, [Russia
might feel emboldened to further **militarise** the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, [exploiting potential **fractures** in
**Western security coordination**]{.underline}.

At the same time, [NATO-aligned **Arctic states**]{.underline}---Canada,

challenge of **geopolitical marginalization** and **strategic
uncertainty**]{.underline}. [Trump's previous disregard for NATO,
coupled with his preference for **bilateralism** over **institutional
frameworks**, leaves these countries in a **precarious
position**]{.underline}. [If the **U.S.** pursues a transactional
**partnership** with **Russia**]{.underline}, [NATO's role in Arctic
security could be **significantly undermined**]{.underline}.

For instance, **[Canada and Norway]{.underline}**---two pillars of
Arctic defence architecture---[may find themselves **sidelined** in
major decisions about Arctic **resource governance**]{.underline},
shipping regulations, and military posturing. [Denmark]{.underline},
already rattled by Trump's Greenland remarks, [could face a new reality
where its geopolitical relevance is diminished not just by **U.S.
unilateralism** but also by a Russian move toward alternative **Arctic
alliances**]{.underline}. The existing framework of Arctic cooperation
through [the Arctic Council and various **NATO exercises** in the **High
North** could suffer serious erosion]{.underline}.

Moreover, such a U[.S.-Russia collaboration might embolden Russia to
press for revisions of **historical agreements**]{.underline}, [such as
the 1920 **Spitsbergen Treaty**]{.underline}, [thereby challenging
Norway's sovereignty over **Svalbard**]{.underline}. If Trump tacitly
supports such moves in exchange [for strategic gains
**elsewhere**]{.underline}, it [could destabilize the northern
**European security environment**]{.underline}.

As NATO Arctic states reevaluate their positions, they may seek to
deepen internal EU-Arctic security cooperation or strengthen trilateral
frameworks with like-minded partners such as the UK or Japan. However,
[without clear support from **Washington**]{.underline}, their [ability
to shape Arctic policy and resist Russian **strategic advances** will be
considerably **weakened**]{.underline}.

China in a recalibrating secondary role, [and NATO Arctic states
grappling with diminished **strategic influence**]{.underline}. [The
resulting fragmentation of Arctic governance would mark a **historic

Putin's ambitions extend beyond Ukraine. His goal is to restore Russia's
status as a superpower, and one of his demands in pre-war negotiations
with the Biden administration was the withdrawal of NATO to its 1997
borders. Such a move would leave the [Baltic states
vulnerable]{.underline}, [effectively dividing **Europe** into spheres
of **influence**]{.underline}. Troublingly, President Trump's foreign
policy approach at times appeared to align with this outlook.

[For Russia, the collapse of NATO could be a more valuable prize than
**territorial gains**]{.underline}. [A limited attack on a border area
of Estonia or Latvia could test **NATO's willingness** to invoke
**Article Five, potentially** revealing a **lack of
resolve**]{.underline}. Even though President Biden has pledged to
defend every inch of NATO territory, the situation evokes the 1939
dilemma of Mourir pour Dantzig (why die for Danzig?), a phrase that
captured the reluctance of Western European countries to defend Poland
against Nazi Germany's aggression, questioning whether they should risk
war over a distant city. [A scenario in which NATO's collective defense
clause is rendered ineffective would leave the Baltic states
**dangerously exposed**]{.underline}.

In response, the [Baltic states must maintain their cooperation with the
**U**nited **S**tates while simultaneously deepening ties with
**European allies**]{.underline}. Such a balanced approach would ensure
they are not overly dependent on any single partner. Meanwhile, Western
countries must continue supporting Ukraine on the battlefield,
recognizing that Ukraine's resilience is critical to deterring further
Russian aggression against the Baltic region.

The Baltic States: Reliable NATO Allies

[The foundation of Baltic security rests on a **strong reliance** on
**NATO** and the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. This strategy is
deeply influenced by the traumatic experiences of World War II when the
Baltic states faced abandonment and endured brutal Soviet occupation due
to a lack of reliable allies. Since regaining independence in 1991,
their guiding principle has been clear: never face threats alone. This
commitment has driven their successful integration into Western
institutions, including membership in NATO and even the Eurozone, which
further bolsters their economic and security ties.

The Baltic states have consistently demonstrated their commitment to
NATO, actively participating in missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and
beyond. Estonia, for instance, has suffered combat losses in Afghanistan
nearly proportional to those of the United States, underscoring its
dedication. Beyond troop contributions, the Baltic states offer
specialized capabilities to the alliance, particularly in the cyber
domain, where their expertise is widely recognized. Their intelligence
services are also highly regarded as reliable partners within NATO.

The recent accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO has significantly
enhanced Baltic security. These two neighboring countries bring
substantial independent defense capabilities and share a common threat
perception, creating a more cohesive and defensible Nordic-Baltic
region. Additionally, Finland and Sweden are members of the U.K.-led
Joint Expeditionary Force, a rapid-reaction group of nine northern
European NATO countries capable of responding swiftly in the Baltic Sea
region.

The Baltic states also maintain close ties with Poland, whose military
is expanding into the largest and best-resourced force in the European
Union. This growing partnership further reinforces regional security and
strengthens the Baltic states' ability to deter potential threats.

Russian Aggression and Baltic Vulnerability

Following the Baltic states' accession to NATO in 2004, the alliance
maintained a cautious approach to avoid provoking Russia. Its initial
presence in the region was limited to an air policing mission of four
fighter jets. However, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 marked a
turning point. In response, NATO established its Enhanced Forward
Presence in the Baltic states, deploying multinational battalions in
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, led by the United Kingdom, Canada, and
Germany, respectively. These forces served as a "tripwire" to deter
Russian aggression, signaling NATO's commitment to collective defense.

Despite this strengthened posture, [the Baltic states have faced **mixed
signals** from the United States]{.underline}. [Under President Trump,
U.S. support for NATO appeared **uncertain**. Trump repeatedly
criticized allies for insufficient **defense spending**, suggesting that
the United States might not protect those who failed to meet **financial
commitments**]{.underline}. For the Baltic states, these criticisms
seemed less threatening, given their consistent defense spending well
above NATO's two percent GDP standard---currently exceeding three
percent. Baltic leaders even commended Trump for pressuring other NATO
members to increase their defense budgets and announced plans to further
boost their own.

[The **U**nited **S**tates' ability to cope with]{.underline} the
pressures of [great-power competition hinges on **securing Europe** and
**preserving the trans-Atlantic alliance**]{.underline}. While it is
true that there are serious and pressing [national security problems in
**Asia** and the **Middle East**]{.underline}, these [can only be dealt
with effectively once the Atlantic foundation of Washington's global
strength is secure]{.underline}. To conduct a future pivot to Asia, the
United States needs a fulcrum in Europe---not vice versa.

Prioritizing the stabilization of Europe may seem to defy logic.
Strategically, [China is]{.underline} without any question [the
**U**nited **S**tates' most capable and dangerous
adversary]{.underline}. Politically, [the Iran-Israel standoff is
**potentially explosive**]{.underline}, currently grabs the most
attention in Washington, and will probably continue to preoccupy U.S.
leaders for a while. Economically, Asia collectively accounts for more
U.S. trade than any other region, and events in the Middle East have a
direct bearing on gas prices in an election year.

It goes without saying that the United States should endeavor to
preserve its interests in all three of these vital regions. But as U.S.
military leaders have repeatedly made clear, the country lacks the
resources to fight two major peers simultaneously. Therefore, the
question of which region should receive the most attention will continue
to present itself.

The answer should continue to be Europe. The reasons are not grounded in
gauzy nostrums about trans-Atlantic solidarity but in clear-eyed
strategic logic.

First, [Europe is **indispensable** to the **U**nited **S**tates in
balance-of-power terms]{.underline}. China may be the United States' top
overseas trade partner when it comes to goods, but [when services and
investment are taken into the equation, the most important economic
partner by far is the **E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}. The United
States invests four times more in Europe than it does in Asia; Europeans
invest 10 times more in the United States than in China and India
combined. The United States has 30 allies in Europe compared to six in
the Indo-Pacific. The collective GDP of European NATO allies is \$20
trillion; that of allied Asia is \$9 trillion. The combined annual
defense spending of U.S. allies in Europe was \$383 billion in 2023,
while that of U.S. allies in Asia was \$140 billion. European allies
make up two of the five permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council and
a larger share of the membership of the world's most important
organizations than any other region.

This is where the balance of power comes in. What these numbers show is
that, [precisely because of China's growing strength, the United States
**cannot afford to forfeit Europe**]{.underline}, either **[politically
or economically]{.underline}**. In a hypothetical scenario, [if the
United States lost its allies in Asia but kept Europe in its corner, it
would retain the capacity to compete with China. But the reverse is not
true. **If the U**nited **S**tates **ever lost
Europe**]{.underline}---for instance, if China succeeded in neutralizing
it or a Russian victory in Ukraine caused key allies to seek
accommodation---**[U.S. allies in Asia could not replace the role of
Europe]{.underline}**.

Second, [Europe is **indispensable** from a geostrategic
perspective]{.underline}. As former U.S. National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski put it, Europe is "America's essential geopolitical
bridgehead on the Eurasian continent." [Its central geography makes it
the pivotal region for addressing global problems]{.underline}. For all
practical purposes, [the Middle East is a sub-theater of Europe. From
Europe, the United States can project power toward Ukraine and **against
Russia**, to]{.underline} the Levant in support of [Israel, and east
into the **Indian Ocean**]{.underline}. For all its enormous importance,
the coastal fringe of [East Asia does not offer these advantages. With
Europe on its side, the **U**nited **S**tates is a Eurasian power;
without Europe, it is]{.underline} mostly a [hemispheric]{.underline}
potentate **[on the margins]{.underline}** of the world.

Third, [Europe is **indispensable in terms of reputation**]{.underline}.
As former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger often pointed out,
[power]{.underline} is not only about material factors; it
[is]{.underline} also [a reflection of the **perception that other
countries hold of a country's power and willingness to use
it**]{.underline}. Whatever its flaws, [modern Europe is the greatest
accomplishment of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. From 1917 until the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, [it took]{.underline} Americans
[two world wars, 14 presidents, and 38 congresses to get
Europe]{.underline}---the source of the biggest threats to U.S. security
in the 20th century---[to where it is today: a continent of
**free-market democracies** modeled]{.underline}, to a large extent, [on
the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Despite what its detractors say,
the trans-Atlantic West represents the strongest force for progress in
modern history, and it is worth preserving.

[This history makes the war in Ukraine the **biggest test of U.S.
reputation in many decades**]{.underline}. Containing Russia is vital to
the one region where Washington has invested the bulk of its
foreign-policy efforts for more than a century. [This is what sets
Ukraine apart from other places that the **U**nited **S**tates'
adversaries may threaten]{.underline}. It's not another Iraq or Vietnam,
the losses of which, however tragic, were peripheral to the core of U.S.
grand strategy. [**To allies and adversaries** alike, **Europe is the
unique bellwether of U.S. resolve**. The **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} simply [**cannot afford to lose a major crisis
in Europe** the way it can in Asia or the Middle East]{.underline}. A
Ukrainian version of the Afghanistan debacle would reverberate globally
for years. [If the United States is willing to cut bait on a European
country fighting the continent's largest land war]{.underline} since
World War II, **[what would it not abandon]{.underline}**?

Fourth, Europe is indispensable to the United States in political and
cultural terms. It's true that strategy cannot be made on the basis of
sentiment. But strategy untethered from the stuff that makes people tick
is unlikely to succeed for long. Notwithstanding domestic demographic
shifts, the deep historical, institutional, economic, cultural, and
personal ties connecting the two sides of the Atlantic will continue to
affect how Americans define their interests. [The defense of Europe is
more likely to sustain U.S. popular sympathy than any other]{.underline}
conceivable foreign [objective]{.underline}. It's hard to imagine a war
over the fate of Taiwan producing the same groundswell of U.S. popular
support that the Ukraine war has consistently produced since February
2022.

The point in all of this is not that the United States should want to
"lose" Asia or the Middle East. Americans have critical strategic and
economic interests in all three regions. Rather, it is that Europe is
the United States' indispensable base in global geopolitics. As any
architect planning a foundation, investor choosing a core holding, or
politician tending to the base knows: Get that right, and other positive
things can be added over time. Get it wrong, and you could very well
lose the whole.

The same is true in geopolitics. [Europe is the **epicenter of** the
**U**nited **S**tates' **international power, resolve, and affinity**.
With Europe, Washington can compete with Beijing **regardless of
developments**]{.underline} in other regions; [without it, **the
U**nited **S**tates **plays at a disadvantage, evicted from Eurasia**
**and deprived of its strongest geopolitical assets**]{.underline}.

Viewed in this light, it is an advantage to the United States that the
first big crisis of the 21st century broke out in Europe.

First, [it gives the United States the opportunity, in a region of
accustomed U.S. strength, to **make a stand** and **stop
aggression**]{.underline} now, [before it can spread]{.underline} to
other places. [Europe is]{.underline} the region [where Washington can
**lead its strongest alliance** to thwart its weakest large-power rival.
If it succeeds, European security will be sounder]{.underline} than it
has been over the last two decades, [allowing Washington to face
Beijing's rising threat]{.underline} for the next two decades. Also,
**[the more Moscow is flailing]{.underline}** in its own war, [the
greater the pressure it is likely to place on Beijing and Tehran to
supply it]{.underline} with materiel that they might otherwise use for
conflicts in their own regions. [**However, if the U**nited **S**tates
**fails**]{.underline}---**[in the hope that Europeans can counter
Russia on their own]{.underline}** or in the belief that Europe is not
as valuable to U.S. interests as Asia---[**then the U**nited **S**tates
**is likely to fail in its rivalry with China**. Tending to the
geopolitical base]{.underline}, in other words, [is the best way to
ensure]{.underline} that [the United States doesn't face one
**monumental, World War III-style showdown** in multiple regions that
would **push U.S. national will and resources to or beyond the
limit**]{.underline}.

Second, the crisis on Europe's eastern frontier has given Washington the
opportunity to reawaken its defense industrial capability and produce
what is most needed in a war: ammunition. Defense procurement in
peacetime tends to favor narrow bureaucratic interests, developing
big-ticket weapons platforms rather than cheap ammunition, aircraft
rather than missiles, tanks rather than artillery shells. The largest
conventional war in modern Europe is now giving Washington the chance to
alter the country's industrial efforts, surging production of missiles,
munitions, and the components that it needs for warfare in both
continental European and Asian maritime warfighting environments. Of all
the military aid Washington has allotted to Ukraine, the vast bulk of it
has gone to U.S. industry to sustain and expand production lines. Many
of the weapons deliveries to Ukraine are from surplus or outdated stock
valued at replacement cost today---with that money going to buy
state-of-the-art weapons for the U.S. military. This would have been
impossible to achieve politically by simply prophesizing a war with
China at some time in the future.

For both reasons, [U.S. strategy should center on **securing
Europe**]{.underline} before turning greater attention to Asia. [This is
the heart of a strategy of sequencing Washington's main geopolitical
rivalries]{.underline}. Observing these truths does not mean that the
United States should not push European allies to take much more
responsibility for their own defense---or that U.S. leaders should not
be urgently preparing the country's economy, military, and society for
the possibility of having to fight a war across multiple regions. Nor
does it lessen the fact that the United States' military situation in
the Indo-Pacific is dire. But [in an era of trade-offs, **choice is
necessary**. The United States will be best positioned to deal with
China]{.underline}, the greatest threat in U.S. history, [with
Europe]{.underline}, the greatest alliance in U.S. history, [**stable
and on its side**. The adage of U.S. strategists in the 20th
century]{.underline}---**[Europe first, Asia
second]{.underline}**---**[remains true in the 21st]{.underline}**.

Yet [Russia could]{.underline} still [cause **considerable problems**
for]{.underline} neighbors like [Poland, Finland, and]{.underline}
especially [the Baltic countries]{.underline} of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania. Those [NATO members bordering Russia would]{.underline}
likely [try to balance Russia **vigorously**, as they have before and
since]{.underline} its [2022]{.underline} invasion of Ukraine.38 The
challenge, however, is that [outside of Poland, the NATO members
bordering Russia are among the alliance's smallest in]{.underline} terms
of [economic output and population]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the major
European powers of the alliance]{.underline}---including France, Germany
and the United Kingdom---[are **more distant** and **may not respond the
same way**. Perceptions of the threat posed by Russia tend to
be]{.underline} far [lower among countries not bordering
it]{.underline}, and [much of Western Europe might feel insulated enough
to **adopt a wait-and-see approach**]{.underline}, particularly [in the
wake of Russia's military struggles in Ukraine]{.underline}. Emmanuel
[Macron]{.underline}, for example, [has long cautioned
against]{.underline} "[humiliating]{.underline}" Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} in Ukraine. 39 Indeed, [Poland and the Baltic
states]{.underline} tend to **[distrust Western Europe's willingness to
defend them, preferring to rely on Washington instead]{.underline}**. 40

There are encouraging signs, including Germany's announcement of a
brigade-sized deployment to Lithuania, its first of the postwar era, but
equipment short- falls continue to raise questions about operational
effectiveness. 41 Whatever [Western European capitals'
intentions]{.underline} today, those intentions [could change when faced
with the choice of actually having to fight]{.underline}. Moreover, the
[defense or liberation of the Baltic countries would be **costly,
operationally difficult**, and **require substantial improvements in
European conventional forces**]{.underline} that so far have not been on
offer.42 Indeed, [despite initial promises]{.underline} in the months
immediately [following]{.underline} Russia's 2022 invasion of [Ukraine,
progress on new funds committed]{.underline} by each member [to
increasing defense capabilities]{.underline}---again, [with the notable
exceptions of NATO's Eastern flank countries]{.underline}---[has proved
slow]{.underline}.

Take the case of Germany, which made ambitious promises of a "sea
change" (Zeitenwende) in foreign policy following Russia's invasion. But
despite approving a 100-billion-euro supplemental defense fund, how it
will use those funds---and over what timeline---remains unclear.
Germany's defense budget will reach NATO's 2 percent of gross domestic
product defense spending target in 2024, but even so, the government has
only promised to reach that target over a "multi- year period" which
might prove fleeting. 44

[If Western Europe is unwilling or unable to act as the security
guarantor of NATO's Eastern flank countries, this would]{.underline} of
course [complicate any US efforts to shift focus]{.underline} toward the
Indo-Pacific. In such a scenario, [the United States risks]{.underline}
either undermining its prioritization of East Asia in order to remain
"Europe's Pacifier" or [allowing Eastern flank countries to become **de
facto buffer states** between]{.underline} the major powers of [Western
Europe and Russia]{.underline}---and [buffer states have a **grim
history**, being far more likely to experience violent
conquest]{.underline} than other countries. 45 [Russia's performance in
Ukraine may]{.underline}, at least [**for a time**, mitigate
concerns]{.underline} about its ability to seize territory from NATO's
Eastern flank members, and allow the alliance to rely on its Article 5
security guarantee for deterrence. **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, a
[diminished perception of Russia's capabilities may]{.underline} also
[weaken Western Europe's perceived need to mount a vigorous defense in
Eastern Europe]{.underline}.

[The post-Cold War era]{.underline} began, in the early 1990s, with
soaring visions of global peace. It [is ending]{.underline}, three
decades later, [with **surging risks of global war**]{.underline}.
[Today, **Europe** is experiencing]{.underline} its most [devastating
military conflict]{.underline} in generations. A [brutal fight between
Israel and Hamas is sowing violence and instability across the **Middle
East**]{.underline}. **[East Asia]{.underline}**, fortunately, is not at
war. But it [isn't exactly peaceful]{.underline}, either, as [China
coerces]{.underline} its [neighbors and amasses military
power]{.underline} at a historic rate. If many Americans don't realize
how close the world is to being ravaged by fierce, interlocking
conflicts, perhaps that's because they've forgotten how the last global
war came about.

When Americans think of global war, they typically think of World War
II---or the part of the war that began with Japan's strike on Pearl
Harbor in December 1941. After that attack, and Adolf Hitler's
subsequent declaration of war against the United States, the conflict
was a single, all-encompassing struggle between rival alliances on a
global battlefield. But [World War II began as a trio of **loosely
connected contests for primacy** in key regions]{.underline} stretching
from Europe to the Asia-Pacific---contests that eventually climaxed and
coalesced in globally consuming ways. The history of this period reveals
the darker aspects of strategic interdependence in a war-torn world. It
also illustrates uncomfortable parallels to the situation Washington
currently confronts.

The United States isn't facing a formalized alliance of adversaries, as
it once did during World War II. It probably won't see a replay of a
scenario in which autocratic powers conquer giant swaths of Eurasia and
its littoral regions. Yet [with wars in eastern Europe and the Middle
East **already raging**, and ties between revisionist states becoming
more pronounced, all it would take is a clash in the]{.underline}
contested [western Pacific to bring about **another awful
scenario**]{.underline}---one [in which intense, interrelated regional
struggles overwhelm the international system and create a **crisis of
global security unlike anything since 1945**]{.underline}. A world at
risk could become a world at war. And the United States isn't remotely
ready for the challenge.

WAR AND REMEMBRANCE

American memories of World War II are indelibly marked by two unique
aspects of the U.S. experience. First, the United States entered the war
very late---more than two years after Hitler rocked Europe by invading
Poland, and more than four years after Japan initiated the Pacific War
by invading China. Second, the United States joined the fight in both
theaters simultaneously. World War II was thus globalized from the
moment the United States entered it; from December 1941 onward, the
conflict featured one multicontinent coalition, the Grand Alliance,
fighting another multicontinent coalition, the Axis, on multiple fronts.
(The exception was that the Soviet Union remained at peace with Japan
from 1941 until 1945.) This was a world war in its fullest, most
comprehensive sense. Yet history's most terrible conflict didn't start
that way.

World War II was the aggregation of three regional crises: Japan's
rampage in China and the Asia-Pacific; Italy's bid for empire in Africa
and the Mediterranean; and Germany's push for hegemony in Europe and
beyond. In some ways, these crises were always linked. Each was the work
of an autocratic regime with a penchant for coercion and violence. Each
involved a lunge for dominance in a globally significant region. Each
contributed to what U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, in 1937, called a
spreading "epidemic of world lawlessness." Even so, this wasn't an
integrated mega-conflict from the outset.

The fascist powers initially had little in common except illiberal
governance and a desire to shatter the status quo. In fact, the vicious
racism that pervaded fascist ideology could work against the cohesion of
this group: Hitler once derided the Japanese as "lacquered
half-monkeys." And although these countries, beginning in 1936, would
seal a series of overlapping security pacts, through the late 1930s they
were as often rivals as allies. Hitler's Germany and Prime Minister
Benito Mussolini's Italy worked at cross-purposes in crises over Austria
in 1934 and Ethiopia in 1935. As late as 1938, Germany was supporting
China in its war of survival against Japan; the next year, it signed a
tacit alliance with the Soviet Union, then fighting an undeclared
conflict against Tokyo in Asia. (Moscow and Tokyo later signed a
non-aggression pact in April 1941, which held until 1945.) Only
gradually did regional crises merge, and rival coalitions cohere,
because of factors that might sound familiar today.

First, whatever their specific---and sometimes conflicting---aims, the
fascist powers had a more fundamental similarity of purpose. All were
seeking a dramatically transformed global order, in which "have not"
powers carved out vast empires through brutal tactics---and in which
brutal regimes surpassed the decadent democracies they despised. "In the
battle between democracy and totalitarianism," Japan's foreign minister
declared in 1940, "the latter . . . will without question win and will
control the world." There was a basic geopolitical and ideological
solidarity among the world's autocracies, which thrust them---and the
conflicts they sowed---closer together over time.

Second, the world developed a perverse form of interdependence, as
[instability in one region exacerbated instability in
another]{.underline}. By humiliating the League of Nations and showing
that aggression could pay, [Italy's assault on Ethiopia]{.underline} in
1935 [paved the way for Hitler's remilitarization of the
Rhineland]{.underline} in 1936. [Germany]{.underline} then [paid it
forward]{.underline} in 1940 [by crushing France, putting the **U**nited
**K**ingdom on the brink, and creating a golden opportunity for Japanese
expansion into Southeast Asia]{.underline}. Particular tactics also
migrated from theater to theater; the use of terror from the air by
Italian forces in Ethiopia, for instance, prefigured its use by German
forces in Spain and Japanese forces in China. Not least, [the sheer
**number** of challenges]{.underline} to the existing order [disoriented
and debilitated its defenders]{.underline}: the United Kingdom had to
tread carefully in dealing with Hitler in crises over Austria and
Czechoslovakia in 1938 because Japan threatened its imperial holdings in
Asia and its Mediterranean lifelines were vulnerable to Italy.

These two factors contributed to a third, which was that programs of
extreme aggression polarized the world and divided it into rival camps.
In the late 1930s, Germany and Italy banded together for mutual
protection against Western democracies that might try to frustrate their
respective ambitions. In 1940, Japan joined the party in hopes of
deterring the United States from interfering with its expansion in Asia.
Through multiple, mutually reinforcing programs of regional revisionism,
the three countries declared, they would create a "new order of things"
in the world.

This new Tripartite Pact didn't ultimately deter Roosevelt, but it did
convince him, as he wrote in 1941, that "the hostilities in Europe, in
Africa, and in Asia are all parts of a single world conflict." Indeed,
as the Axis cohered and its aggression intensified, it gradually forced
a vast array of countries into a rival alliance dedicated to frustrating
those designs. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and Hitler declared war
on Washington, they brought the United States into conflicts in Europe
and the Pacific---and turned those regional clashes into a global
struggle.

PAST IS PRESENT

The parallels between this earlier era and the present are striking.
Today, as in the 1930s, [the international system is facing **three
sharp regional challenges**. China is rapidly amassing military
might]{.underline} as part of its campaign [to eject the **U**nited
**S**tates from the western Pacific]{.underline}---and, perhaps, become
the world's preeminent power. [Russia's war in Ukraine is the murderous
centerpiece of its long-standing effort to reclaim primacy]{.underline}
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet space. [In the Middle East, Iran
and its coterie of proxies]{.underline}---Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis,
and many others---[are waging a **bloody struggle for regional
dominance**]{.underline} against Israel, the Gulf monarchies, and the
United States. Once again, [the fundamental commonalities
linking]{.underline} the [revisionist states are autocratic governance
and]{.underline} geopolitical grievance; in this case, [a desire to
break]{.underline} a [U.S.-led order]{.underline} that deprives them of
the greatness they desire. Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran are the new "have
not" powers, struggling against the "haves": Washington and its allies.

Two of these challenges have already turned hot. The war in Ukraine is
also a vicious proxy contest between Russia and the West; Russian
President Vladimir Putin is buckling down for a long, grinding struggle
that could last for years. Hamas's attack on Israel last
October---enabled, if perhaps not explicitly blessed, by
Tehran---triggered an intense conflict that is creating violent
spillover across that vital region. Iran, meanwhile, is creeping toward
nuclear weapons, which could turbocharge its regional revisionism by
indemnifying its regime against an Israeli or U.S. response. In the
western Pacific and mainland Asia, China is still relying mostly on
coercion short of war. But [as the military balance shifts
in]{.underline} sensitive spots such as the [Taiwan]{.underline} Strait
[or the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea, Beijing will have better
options]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} perhaps [a bigger
appetite]{.underline}---[for aggression]{.underline}.

As in the 1930s, the revisionist powers don't always see eye-to-eye.
Russia and China both seek preeminence in central Asia. They are also
pushing into the Middle East, in ways that sometimes cut across Iran's
interests there. If the revisionists do eventually push their common
enemy, the United States, out of Eurasia, they might end up fighting
among themselves over the spoils---just as the Axis powers, had they
somehow defeated their rivals, surely would have then turned on one
another. Yet for now, the ties between revisionist powers are
flourishing and Eurasia's regional conflicts are becoming more tightly
interlinked.

[**Russia and China are drawing closer** through their]{.underline} "[no
limits]{.underline}" [strategic partnership, which features arms sales,
deepening defense-technological **coop**eration, and displays of
geopolitical solidarity such as military exercises **in global hot
spots**]{.underline}. And just as the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939
once allowed Germany and the Soviet Union to rampage through eastern
Europe without risking conflict with each other, [the]{.underline}
Sino-Russian [partnership]{.underline} has [pacified what was once the
world's most militarized border and enabled both]{.underline} countries
[to **focus on**]{.underline} their contests with **[Washington and its
friends]{.underline}**. More recently, the war in [Ukraine]{.underline}
has also [enhanced]{.underline} other Eurasian
[relationships]{.underline}---[between Russia and Iran, and Russia and
North Korea]{.underline}---while intensifying and interweaving the
challenges the respective revisionists pose.

Drones, artillery ammunition, and ballistic missiles provided by [Tehran
and Pyongyang]{.underline}---along with economic succor provided by
Beijing---[have **sustained Moscow**]{.underline} in its conflict
against Kyiv and its Western backers. In exchange, Moscow appears to be
transferring more sensitive military technology and know-how: selling
advanced aircraft to Iran, reportedly offering aid to North Korea's
advanced weapons programs, perhaps even helping China build its
next-generation attack submarine. Other regional tussles are revealing
similar dynamics. In the Middle East, [Hamas is fighting]{.underline}
Israel [with Chinese, Russian, Iranian, and North Korean
weapons]{.underline} that [it has been accumulating for
years]{.underline}. Since October 7, Putin has declared that conflicts
in Ukraine and the Middle East are part of a single, larger struggle
that "will decide the fate of Russia, and of the entire world." And in
another echo of the past, tensions across Eurasia's key theaters stretch
U.S. resources thin by confronting the superpower with multiple dilemmas
simultaneously. The revisionist powers aid each other simply by doing
their own things.

One crucial difference between the 1930s and today is the scale of the
revisionism. As bad as Putin and Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are,
they haven't devoured huge chunks of crucial regions. Another crucial
difference is that East Asia still enjoys a tenuous peace. But with U.S.
officials warning that China could become more belligerent as its
capabilities mature---perhaps as soon as the second half of this
decade---it is worth considering what would happen if that region
erupted.

Such a conflict would be catastrophic in multiple respects. [Chinese
aggression against Taiwan could]{.underline} well [**trigger a war with
the U**nited **S**tates, pitting the world's two most
powerful]{.underline} militaries---and their two **[nuclear
arsenals]{.underline}**---[**against each other**. It would wrench
global commerce in ways that make]{.underline} the dislocations provoked
by the wars in [Ukraine and Gaza look **trivial**. It would]{.underline}
further [polarize global politics as the United States seeks to rally
the democratic world against Chinese aggression]{.underline}---[pushing
Beijing into]{.underline} a [tighter embrace with Russia and other
autocratic powers]{.underline}.

Most critically, [if combined with ongoing conflicts
elsewhere]{.underline}, a [war in East Asia could create a
situation]{.underline} unlike anything since the 1940s, [in which all
three key regions of Eurasia are **ablaze with large-scale violence at
once**]{.underline}. This might not become a single, all-encompassing
world war. But [it would make for a world **plagued by war**
as]{.underline} the United States and other [defenders of the existing
order confronted multiple, interlocking conflicts]{.underline} spanning
some of the most important strategic terrain on Earth.

GATHERING STORMS

There are lots of reasons that this scenario might not happen. East Asia
could remain at peace, because the United States and China have immense
incentives to avoid a horrific war. The fighting in Ukraine and the
Middle East could subside. But thinking through the nightmare scenario
is still worthwhile, since the world could be as little as one
mishandled crisis away from pervasive Eurasian conflict---and because
the United States is so unprepared for this eventuality.

[Right now, the United States is **straining**]{.underline} to support
Israel and Ukraine simultaneously. The demands of these two
wars---fights in which Washington is not yet a principal combatant---are
stretching U.S. capabilities in areas such as artillery and missile
defense. Deployments to the waters around the Middle East, meant to
deter Iran and keep critical sea lanes open, are taxing.

#### Maintaining [vigilance]{.underline} in protecting frontline allies is key to stop [global conflict]{.underline}.

In 2017, we wrote a book arguing that the United States faced
simultaneous tests from Russia, China, and Iran. We argued that these
tests, or "probes," were occurring at the outer perimeter of U.S.
power---the "unquiet frontier," as we called it. **[Front-line
allies]{.underline}**, such as Poland, Israel, and Taiwan, we wrote,
[were tempting targets for]{.underline} the [**U**nited **St**ates'
adversaries because of]{.underline} their [**vulnerable geography** and
great distance from the U.S. homeland]{.underline}.

Seven years later, [this frontier]{.underline} is more than unquiet---it
[is in **flames**. On the **Europe**an frontier, the largest war since
1945 is entering its third yea]{.underline}r. On the Middle Eastern
frontier, [Iran is using its]{.underline} network of [proxies to wage an
undeclared war against the **U**nited **S**tates and
**Israel**]{.underline}. On the Asia-Pacific frontier, [**China** is
accumulating military assets to cross the **Taiwan**
Strait]{.underline}.

Collectively, these moves suggest that the [**U**nited **S**tates'
rivals are]{.underline} not only [**probing the firmness of the frontier
adjacent to** them but also anticipating a dramatic opportunity to upset
the wider order that has underwritten Western security]{.underline} and
well-being [for decades]{.underline}. The frontier---and with it, the
entire game board---is in crisis.

All of this may be sobering to a generation in the West expecting the
world to become an ever-expanding zone of peace. But there's nothing new
about it. Historically, the strength of a great power and the political
order it embodies have been shaped by events on the frontier more than
events in the relatively safer confines of the imperial interior. Rome's
great crises began on the banks of the Rhine, Danube, and Tigris. The
British Empire's moments of truth were in Natal, the Hindu Kush, and the
Sudetenland.

Then, as now, moments of violent upheaval naturally prompt debates about
the character of geopolitical change and the right strategies to cope
with it. How should a great power manage a lengthy and distant frontier
under attack? While the United States is unique in the sheer scale of
military and economic power it possesses, the question is no easier than
it was for past empires; U.S. power, like theirs, has limits. It is
limited in quantity, by geographic distance, by domestic concerns, and
by Americans' own, often fickle political will. The United States'
predicament, in other words, is not new.

While the debate rages about how to handle what's happening in Eastern
Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, it may be worth pausing to
consider the situation from a historical perspective. Short of
abandoning the frontier outposts under pressure from predatory powers,
great powers in the past tended to follow five basic principles for
managing an unquiet frontier.

First, [the frontier is a violent place where **war is always
possible**]{.underline}. By definition, the frontier is a zone of
competition among rivals. It is an object coveted in its own right for
its strategic location, but [it is]{.underline} also [the place where
**colliding agendas**]{.underline}---[between powers seeking to maintain
the geopolitical status quo and those seeking to revise
it]{.underline}---[inevitably play out]{.underline}. While it is
possible to mitigate the clash through negotiations, trade, or bribes, a
frontier separates powers that have deep conflicts of interests grounded
in history, civilizational contrasts, or ideological differences. As a
result, violence is never too far below the surface.

This may sound obvious, but it's worth stating upfront because it runs
counter to a Western conceit that lasted until the very eve of Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine: namely, that old-fashioned wars of
conquest don't happen nowadays, even in historically fraught locations,
because of the civilizing effects of liberal institutions or
globalization---or the deterrent effect of all-powerful military
technology. That's not true and probably won't ever be true. [Violence
is **endemic to the frontier**]{.underline}, and the [current wars and
threats in **Ukraine**, the **Middle East**, and **East Asia** should
have surprised no one]{.underline}. A realistic strategy to manage
violence along the frontier begins by recognizing that fact, as well as
its corollary: that [preserving the **s**tatus **quo** requires an
**unsleeping vigilance** in these distant places. No international
institutions or]{.underline} sets of [rules will prevent the **U**nited
**S**tates' rivals from seeking to expand]{.underline} their control
over key regions in Eurasia, where Washington has vital economic and
political partners.

Second, [well-armed and motivated frontier states are the **best
deterrent**]{.underline} on the frontier. What the inhabitants of the
frontier have in common with the distant power is a desire to not see
the frontier fall into the hands of a nearby bully. The distant power's
motivation is to prevent the rival from accumulating a bigger power
base. But [the frontier state's motivation is much]{.underline}, much
greater and [more personal: **ensuring its own survival**. It has the
most to lose]{.underline} if the frontier breaks and disgorges Scythian
hordes.

This greater motivation makes [frontier states]{.underline} the most
effective source of resistance to threats against the frontier. They
[are the **first responders**]{.underline}, and [their determination is
the **foundational bloc of a stable frontier**]{.underline}. Local
resolve trumps United Nations resolutions. From the standpoint of their
great-power patron, it is also a very good thing to work with the
momentum of locals' desire to resist---[whether it takes the form of
Ukraine's struggle]{.underline} to not be absorbed into a new Russian
empire, [Israeli defiance of Iranian]{.underline} plans for [regional
dominance, or Taiwan's effort not to be subsumed under the **C**hinese
**C**ommunist **P**arty's rule]{.underline}. Countries at the frontier
are a source of amply motivated, effective, and legitimate resistance to
their own enemies; [without]{.underline} that [resistance, the
superpower patron would have to venture]{.underline} much **[more of its
own blood and treasure]{.underline}**. There may, of course, be many
differences between the front-line state and its far-away patron, but at
least on this core strategic point---that the frontier should not be
breached---their interests naturally converge.

Third, preclusive defense is the preferred strategy. Preclusive defense
actively guards a frontier by positioning sufficient forces to repulse
an initial attack and conduct local counteroffensives. Treating a
frontier as a flexible line, with the option of pulling back when under
pressure, is tempting, especially when military resources are scarce or
unavailable. But the cost of sacrificing space for time---defense in
depth---is much higher than it may appear because front-line allies will
peel away. If the ally thinks it is expendable---that its territory and
people are the space to be given to the enemy in a tactic to gain time
to arrest the attack elsewhere---that ally will lose the resolve to
defend the frontier. Alone, with no outside help, the choice for a
frontier state becomes one between accepting a change in the status quo
and resisting at high cost with a low probability of success. Some, such
as Ukraine, may choose the latter, but it is not a given that this is
the most common path. In fact, the heavy costs incurred by Ukraine may
plausibly dissuade others, such as Taiwan, from following its example.
[When a front-line ally wobbles and falls]{.underline} under the rival's
control, [the distant patron loses its ability to shape the regional
dynamics. This is especially dangerous when the patron is a **maritime
power**]{.underline} that has no depth to give: [Such a power either
keeps a port or thin littoral or is fully expelled from the
region]{.underline} with no chance of a cost-free return.

The value of [frontier allies]{.underline} is that they [create the
potential for **striking beyond the frontier line**, on the territory of
the predator state itself. The]{.underline} very [potential for such
attacks **strengthens deterrence** because the frontier
state's]{.underline} strong [motivation for self-defense lends
**cred**ibility to its threats]{.underline}. That requires it to be
capable of inflicting heavy costs on---or launching punitive raids
against---the nearby predator state. Thus, paradoxically, [the stability
of a frontier is **helped by the local ability to escalate**. Such
escalation is kept in check by the fact]{.underline} that [the
front-line state is the first to bear the brunt of the rival's response,
establishing powerful incentives to strike **only as
required**]{.underline} for the operational purpose of keeping the
frontier stable. In other words, a small frontier state, even if well
armed, is unlikely to ever march on the capital of the rival.

Ukraine's ability to strike Russian military targets deep in occupied
Crimea or immediately beyond the border would weaken Russia's offensive
actions---and if a cease-fire ever occurs, this continued ability would
reinforce deterrence. Similarly, Taiwan could more effectively deter
China if it had the capability and clear will to strike not just the
immediately attacking forces but also Chinese ports. In brief,
deterrence is much stronger when the defender is not just holding the
fortress but has the ability to strike an attacker's encampments. Giving
weapons, even very powerful ones, to the frontier state is a good
investment.

Fourth, the [**rep**utation **acquired or lost on one front**ier
**matters on another**. Predator states watch how their rival great
power handles other]{.underline}, often [distant frontiers to **gauge
the level of its power** and the **competence of its
leadership**]{.underline}. Reputation is particularly important for a
maritime power, whose core challenge is the length of the frontier it
has to manage combined with its distance from the homeland. [Given
naturally finite means, it is difficult to maintain substantial and
perpetual presence in any and all directions]{.underline}. Strategic
ubiquity is an illusion, a calculated bluff predicated on reputation.

What follows from this is that [**it pays to stop aggression at the
frontier early when and where it happens first**. How the initial fires
are dealt with will have a big bearing on whether they spread into a
wider **system crisis**. Ignoring]{.underline} the [early ones in hopes
of keeping powder dry for later ones is **dangerous**]{.underline}, and
the best strategy is to decisively sequence the frontiers. Today, that
means using Russian President Vladimir Putin's attack as an opportunity
to impose a strategic defeat on Russia, the weaker of the United States'
two main rivals, before the stronger of the two, China, is ready to move
against Taiwan. Washington should not attempt to shift priorities
midstream.

Fifth, [once breached or abandoned, a frontier is **costly to
stabilize**]{.underline}. As defense is cheaper than offense, so is
maintaining a frontier versus restoring the status quo ante. In the most
dramatic case, [when the great power is pushed out]{.underline} from
([or leaves]{.underline}) [a front-line region, reentry is **extremely
difficult**]{.underline} both for military and political reasons.
Militarily, trenches and fortifications---and in today's high-tech
environment, an array of anti-access and area denial weapons---impose
high casualties on the attacking side. Politically, [abandoned
front-line locals]{.underline} will likely [make different calculations:
Facing their nearby enemies as their]{.underline} security [patron
leaves, they may decide]{.underline} that [their least bad choice is to
**cozy up to their enemies**]{.underline}. Reentry for the great power
that has left becomes thus a costly and solitary effort with limited
indigenous support. [If the **U**nited **St**ates abandons Ukraine,
Israel, or Taiwan]{.underline} today [and these places fall under a
**rival's sphere of influence**, it is **unlikely**]{.underline} that
[this could be reversed]{.underline} in our lifetimes [without a much
**steeper cost**]{.underline} in blood and treasure than if Washington
had simply helped them to defend themselves adequately in the first
place.

In all of these cases, the point is that bolstering the frontier is not
an act of charity for a great power like the United States today.
Instead, it is an act of enlightened self-interest that, if undertaken
with energy and forethought, offers a cost-effective way of securing the
homeland itself. The United States has a long tradition of thinking in
very practical terms about unquiet frontiers, on both its own continent
and the Eurasian rimlands. These were and are the regions where the
noble and pacifying tools of institutions and laws, the calculations of
merchants, and the impartiality of judges have a tenuous effect.
Ultimately, [how]{.underline} these [frontiers are ordered is the
product of a firm hold exercised through violence or threat
thereof]{.underline}. That reality has not changed, and [the wars in
Ukraine and the Middle East are testaments to the frontier's **eternally
ferocious nature**]{.underline}.

In the current situation, [history suggests]{.underline} that [the
**U**nited **S**tates' best bet is to **prevent its rivals'
probes**]{.underline} on the frontier [**from becoming a wider,
systemwide run on the bank**. Whether the first probe
succeeds]{.underline} or fails [matters **disproportionately** for
determining whether a sequence]{.underline} of probes
[occurs]{.underline}. While Asia matters most for the United States
strategically, [defeating ongoing aggression on the European and Middle
Eastern frontiers]{.underline}---if that can still be
done---[remains]{.underline} the [optimal]{.underline} strategy. The
best way to do that is to provide weapons to Ukraine and Israel,
including weapons that Washington might not normally be comfortable
dispersing. Doing that, in turn, will require a serious effort to
strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base, which will be needed in the
long confrontation with China as well.

What the United States does on these distant frontiers is, of course, of
secondary importance if the more immediate frontier---the national
border---is broken. When we wrote The Unquiet Frontier, we did not
expect that the U.S. southern border would become so unstable, not to
mention becoming so at the same time as geopolitical rivals amp up the
level of violence in Eurasia. Fixing the border is thus not just a
domestic priority but a foreign-policy prerequisite: The distant
frontier will be abandoned sooner or later if the national border
becomes a locus of instability.

[**It is not too late**. Even though U.S. rivals have improved their
position]{.underline} in recent years, advancing their control and
building up their arm stores, [Americans still have an opportunity to
conserve]{.underline} a modicum of [**international order and
security**. It's better to stop predator states]{.underline} at the far
frontier [by backing]{.underline} the efforts of [motivated locals than
attempting to do so after these places are lost]{.underline}. And [it's
easier to **keep things stable** than to bring back stability after it's
lost]{.underline}. And [that begins, and ends, at the
frontier]{.underline}.

[The **cred**ibility of NATO, and]{.underline} thus [of the **U**nited

[the]{.underline} three [states **most vulnerable** to

\<\<Title\>\> Germany debates nuclear weapons, again. [But **now it's
different**]{.underline}

[What's **different** this time]{.underline}? The latest iteration of
the German nuclear debate nevertheless shows some key differences from
previous ones. [First, it takes place in a European security environment
that has moved much closer to the scenario of **US abandonment** and
**Russian aggr**ession]{.underline} than most assumed back in 2016, when
Trump rattled Europeans for the first time. As a consequence,
[**proliferation chatter** is not an exclusively **German specialty**
anymore]{.underline}. Most notably Polish leaders, including President
Andrzej Duda and new Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, have publicly
mused about nuclear weapons other than the United States'.

Second, while the early German nuclear debates featured mostly pundits,
journalists, and some political backbenchers, [those who now favorably
discuss deterrence alternatives increasingly include current and former
**heavyweights** from across the **political spectrum**]{.underline}.
They include Friedrich Merz, Wolfgang Schäuble, and Manfred Weber from
the Conservatives, Sigmar Gabriel and Katarina Barley from the Social
Democrats, and Joschka Fischer and Sergey Logodinsky from the Greens.
When Germany's Finance Minister Christian Lindner from the Free
Democrats joined the chorus in mid-February, Chancellor Olaf Scholz
finally had to put his foot down: He reminded his fellow coalition
partner that "Germany decided a long time ago not to seek its own
nuclear weapons."

Third, [nuclear disarmament]{.underline}---a central pillar of post-Cold
War German foreign and security policy---[does not play a role in the
German **public discourse** any more]{.underline}. When in March 2022
Annalena Baerbock, Germany's Foreign Minister from the Greens, urged
Germans in response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine to
"understand disarmament and arms control as being complementary to
deterrence and defense," everyone in Berlin got the point. [A recent
comparative analysis of Bundestag statements found that the
word]{.underline} "**[disarmament]{.underline}**" [barely showed up in
parliamentary debates in **2022**]{.underline}---[a stark
**difference**]{.underline} with previous years. [Prior iterations of
the German nuclear debate had seen multiple expert interventions in
favor of **disarmament**]{.underline} and arms control policies. But
[these voices have mostly **gone silent** now]{.underline}.

Fourth, [a newfound **hawkishness** has come to **dominate** the German
media discourse]{.underline}. [Fueled by a few dozen hardline **think
tankers**]{.underline} and politicians, [restraint]{.underline}---in
every form, including the obvious limitations of a mutual deterrence
relationship with Russia---[is considered **weak** and a sign of
**fear** of **Russia**]{.underline}. "Self-deterrence" is the main
charge levelled against Scholz to dismiss every consideration of
potential escalation pathways vis-à-vis Russia.

[All this happens on the back of a shift in **public
opinion**]{.underline}. Latest surveys show that Germans see nuclear
weapons much less negatively than in the past. In a poll conducted by
German pollster Infratest-dimap in mid 2022, for the first time in
decades a majority of respondents said they welcomed US nuclear weapons
deployed on German soil. When the German nuclear debate kicked off in
2016, nuclear skeptics could still claim that the entire discussion was
out of touch with Germans' long-standing preference for nuclear
abolition. Today, that is no longer a clear-cut case.

What's next? So far in the debate, the shifting parameters have not gone
so far as to lead the government to pursue any visible changes to
Germany's deterrence arrangements. No less important, 90 percent of
Germans reject the notion that the country should have its own nuclear
weapons. [The combination of Germany's **security dependence** and
**political conservatism**]{.underline}, **[however]{.underline}**,
[might lead to **difficult choices** ahead]{.underline}.

[A reelection of Trump and subsequent **policy changes** in **US nuclear
guarantees** to **European allies** could lay bare the **obvious
downsides** of German **dependency**]{.underline}. At the same time,
[German conservatism could force the country to search for **deterrence
alternatives**]{.underline} in such a scenario.

DG

[Policy makers]{.underline} and national security experts
[are]{.underline} now **[seriously discussing]{.underline}** the
possible need for [a European nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. For
example, former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, in an interview
with the weekly Die Zeit in December 2023, supported the idea of a
European nuclear deterrent. Other supporters of a European---or even a
German---nuclear arsenal have contributed regularly to conservative
German newspapers.

In 1975, the West German government stated that its ratification of the
accession of the Federal Republic to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
would not preclude an eventual nuclear deterrent within the framework of
the European Union. The issue of a European nuclear deterrent also
blends into the related question as to what role, if any, remains for
so-called "tactical" or non-strategic nuclear weapons in NATO.\[1\]

There are several political and military arguments in favor of this
proposal. But there are certainly also reasons for skepticism and
concern that, considered together, add up to the conclusion that [a
Eurodeterrent **continues to be a bad idea**]{.underline}.\[2\]

Rationale for a Eurodeterrent. The first reason given for a European
nuclear deterrent is the possibility that a future US president might
not be as committed to NATO as his or her predecessors. This was a
concern raised during the administration of President Donald Trump,
whose open disparagement of European allies for allegedly insufficient
financial contributions to NATO alliance security raised alarms from
Brussels to Washington. Although [Trump's actual policies turned
out]{.underline} to be [less disruptive than his]{.underline}
inflammatory [rhetoric]{.underline}, his possible return to the White
House in 2025 could reboot European doubts about US security
commitments. These doubts could include concerns about the role of
America's nuclear umbrella in the deterrence of war in Europe.

A second reason for the renewed interest in a possible European nuclear
deterrent is the war in Ukraine and the recurring threats by Russian
President Vladimir Putin to resort to nuclear first use if needed to
protect Russian security interests in that region.\[3\] [Some
Europeans]{.underline} who [feel immediately threatened by Russian
nuclear coercion]{.underline}, or even by the possibility of a Russian
conventional military victory over Ukraine, might doubt the efficacy of
America's nuclear guarantee in the face of an increasingly confident
Russia [casting a larger shadow over]{.underline} the security of
**[Eastern and Central European countries]{.underline}**. Although
Russia would still have its hands full of resistance and rebellion in
Ukraine, even after having defenestrated the Zelensky government,
European and American solidarity to further resist Russian diplomatic
coercion supported by military power might weaken.

A third reason might be the growing nationalism in Europe and in the
United States, spanning across the general public, leadership classes,
and political office holders. The heady optimism about the North
Atlantic security community that marked the Cold War and its immediate
aftermath is now being challenged from many sides. Newer generations of
voters show skepticism about the benefits of transnational and
trans-Atlantic security and economic cooperation. There is also the
growing significance among Europeans and Americans of identity politics,
including doubts about the impact of foreign migration and so-called
alarms over a dilution of national character. Parties of the far right
are drawing increased strength in part from voters who feel
denationalized by foreign influences and globalist agendas.

[A fourth concern]{.underline} among some supporters of a European
nuclear deterrent [lies in **doubts about the reliability of the US
nuclear umbrella**]{.underline} for the deterrence of war in Europe.
NATO has only a small number of deployed nuclear weapons on European
soil compared to Russia's large inventory of nearly two thousand
less-than-strategic or "tactical" nuclear weapons. Russia might be
tempted under pessimistic conditions of unacceptable loss in
conventional warfare, as they define "unacceptable," to cross the
nuclear threshold in any one of a number of ways.

Russia could engage in a demonstrative strike for coercive purposes with
a low-yield nuclear weapon, which would do little immediate damage
compared to the larger weapons that are prepositioned in its arsenal and
raised to combat alert readiness in a crisis. Or Russia could employ a
tactical nuclear weapon against a key Ukrainian or NATO military target
to prepare the battlespace for a larger war. Would the United States and
NATO risk responding with nuclear strikes of their own and thereby
escalating the conflict to a larger nuclear war that might destroy much
of Europe and ultimately the US homeland? Some military experts feel
that the United States lacks a sufficient number of small yield nuclear
weapons in its arsenal, compared to Russia's larger inventories, and so
would have lost escalation dominance across the spectrum of military
options short of unrestricted nuclear warfare.

But [more weapons do not]{.underline} necessarily [equate to better
deterrence]{.underline}. Deterrence remains centered in the mind of the
deterree, not the deterrer. [Guessing the threshold of conventional
defeat beyond which Russia would]{.underline} feel obligated to [resort
to nuclear first use requires disciplined intelligence
collection]{.underline} in real time, combined with mature judgment
about Russia's imminent priorities and risks.

Why it's a bad idea. Despite these legitimate concerns about nuclear
risks in Europe, it is not clear whether a European nuclear
deterrent---either entirely separated from its American umbrella or
somehow aligned with it for policy purposes---would enhance the
credibility of deterrence or nuclear crisis stability. In fact, at least
for four reasons, the opposite result is more probable.

First, [legitimate concern should not give way to exaggerated fears
of]{.underline} NATO or [US abandonment]{.underline} of their political
commitment to the deterrence of war in Europe or its defense if
necessary. One might argue that NATO was more likely to wobble in the
face of Russian intimidation when NATO was preoccupied with "out of the
area" commitments in the Middle East and South Asia. Since 2014,
however, when Russia annexed Crimea in a coup de main that caught the
West asleep, [NATO has witnessed a **renaissance of awareness** about
its]{.underline} original [mission to guarantee the peace in
Europe]{.underline}. Russia's war against [Ukraine]{.underline} further
[aroused NATO to a **unified** political and military
**stance**]{.underline}. However the conventional war between Russia and
Ukraine turns out, NATO is stronger than it has ever been since the Cold
War ended. The addition of Finland and the imminent addition of Sweden
to NATO membership represent geostrategic fiascoes for Russia---and an
outcome Putin and his advisors surely had not anticipated. NATO's
nuclear guarantee, [supported by the **U**nited **S**tates' nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}, should never be doubted. Escalation is a two way
street: [Russia fears as much as European NATO countries that a
**nuclear first use** could lead to a process that
**escapes**]{.underline} the **[control]{.underline}** of political
leaderships playing at nuclear coercive diplomacy under unprecedented
conditions of stress and uncertainty.

A second challenge for a European nuclear deterrent lies in its
organization and operational shape, including the chain of command over
a (presumably) multinational nuclear force. Something like this was
attempted in the 1960s when several military planners and politicians
put forward a proposal for a Multilateral Force (MLF) mixing personnel
and weapons, including nuclear warheads, from several European powers.
[The problems of authoritative political control and operational
management]{.underline} in such a force soon [became
**evident**]{.underline} and proved to be too challenging. Even short of
an explicitly multinational force, a transnational European nuclear
deterrent presents problems of political collaboration and
military-operational command. One might propose that the United Kingdom
and France, currently the only two nuclear weapons states among European
NATO countries, move toward joint operations with respect to certain
well defined contingencies and emergencies. Yet their political and
military command and control systems would still have to remain separate
for reasons of national sovereignty and military efficiency. In
addition, because the United Kingdom is no longer in the European Union,
a "Eurodeterrent" would not be under the political supervision of EU
institutions and therefore be reduced to a bilateral cooperation.
Another issue is that the European nuclear powers have very different
delivery systems for nuclear weapons: The United Kingdom fields a fleet
of ballistic missile submarines, while France also has land-based and
carrier-based airborne delivery systems.

A third riposte to the idea of [a European nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} is that it [might **stimulate nuclear
prolif**eration and]{.underline} ultimately [lead to **more nuclear**
weapons **states**]{.underline}, either [**in Europe or beyond**.
Reliance on the US nuclear guarantee]{.underline} has
[helped]{.underline} to [prevent the spread of **nuc**lear weapon**s**
not only in Europe, but also in **Asia** with respect to South **Korea
and Japan**. If countries]{.underline} now [start doubting the
**cred**ibility of the US nuclear deterrent and feel immediately
threatened]{.underline} by the growing capabilities of hostile
neighbors, [their leaders and publics]{.underline} might **[turn to
national nuclear forces]{.underline}** as a guarantor against aggression
or nuclear coercion. This could be tempting because, based on the
historical evidence, even a small number of nuclear weapons can be
deterring to adversaries who might otherwise contemplate a conventional
war against a state. If North Korea continues to menace South Korea with
military threats, including nuclear ones, [South Korea might
**reverse**]{.underline} its **[prior disinterest]{.underline}** in its
own nuclear force. [Japan]{.underline} too, if it feels [threatened by a
rising China, might reluctantly become more interested]{.underline} in a
small but survivable force of sea-based nuclear missiles.

Fourth, [the argument]{.underline} that [the US nuclear force is
insufficiently flexible]{.underline} for deterring or responding to
nuclear coercion or nuclear first use [deserves]{.underline} further
[scrutiny]{.underline}. The United States' combatant commanders who
operate the unified and specified commands in wartime are also
responsible for planning against a range of threats across the spectrum
of conventional war and nuclear deterrence. [Flexibility and multiple
options are built into]{.underline} these [plans for **every
challenge**, ranging from unconventional wars and coercive diplomacy to
limited or large-scale conventional war to]{.underline}, if necessary,
**[nuclear]{.underline}** coercion or **[retaliation]{.underline}**.
Plans are scrubbed repeatedly and road-tested in near-realistic
exercises.

In today's world of high tech competition among major powers, [neither
the **U**nited **S**tates nor any other aspiring military can afford to
rest on dated plans]{.underline}, aging technology, or roseate
assumptions about the likelihood of wars. Surprises are inevitable:
preparation and agility are the hallmarks of superior military
performance. As Dwight D. Eisenhower famously said: "Plans are
worthless, but planning is everything."

[A world filled with nuclear states is]{.underline} a **[more
dangerous]{.underline}** world. The United States and Soviet Union had
multiple close calls [during the Cold War: mistakes, escalation and
technical glitches]{.underline}. We know that [a world with many more
nuclear states will be plagued in the same way. **Any small clash could
risk a wider nuclear conflict**. It is a matter of **hard work and
luck**]{.underline} that [it hasn\'t happened already]{.underline}. Will
the same hold true for the new nuclear-armed powers? One need look no
farther than India and Pakistan to see that having nuclear weapons has
neither kept the peace nor prevented escalation on a regular basis. The
attacks and counterattacks in May reminded the world that [escalation
remains a **constant risk** when nuclear states clash. With nuclear
weapons, **leaders have to get every decision right all the time. The
more countries that have nuclear weapons, the more our luck will be
tested**]{.underline}.

The chain of [global nuclear security is only as good as its weakest
link]{.underline}. The United States has worked for many decades to help
nations protect civilian research facilities with sensitive nuclear
materials to avoid enriched uranium or plutonium from falling into the
wrong hands. But [more nuclear states will mean more **targets for
theft** by bad actors]{.underline} - **[state and
non-state]{.underline}** - [as well as by criminal networks and
disgruntled employees]{.underline}. Even if one country manages its
responsibilities well, [a sudden change in government, coup or economic
collapse can quickly turn a nuclear arsenal into an acute
problem]{.underline}.

For many Americans reading this, there is no doubt a sense of remove
from the relevance of the European project. Think of it this way: [for
centuries Europe was the Middle East of the world. It was a war-hungry,
dysfunctional, violent, chaotic piece of the globe that could barely go
a decade without a barbaric, usually pointless blood-letting conflict.
Since World War II]{.underline} and the **[economic and political
integration]{.underline}** that [brought]{.underline} former
nation-state rivals into mutually beneficial [coexistence]{.underline},
the continent has been a region of [remarkable prosperity and
stability]{.underline}. Keep in mind, this has never happened before in
human history: a set of political leaders and their constituents
voluntarily chose to cede elements of sovereignty in order to form a
better, stronger union. The United States and Great Britain, often
mentioned as democratic ideals, were two empires won by violent conquest
in which wealthy elites only begrudgingly allowed democracy to sift down
to the most impoverished and brutalized citizens.

The parochial movements of the last five to ten years---from the EU's
troubles to the Scottish independence vote to the surge of American
nationalism that brought us such phenomenon as the go-it-alone war in
Iraq and now Donald Trump---have different roots and causes but they do
share a common thread. [We live in an increasingly complex and

The second, evident implication of the withdrawal of US nuclear
deterrence from Europe would be the risk of nuclear proliferation. The
[US's extended nuclear deterrence]{.underline} has, over the years,
explicitly [aimed to counter proliferation]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [US
allies have used the 'threat' of proliferation to bargain]{.underline}
for more extensive nuclear guarantees (Volpe, 2017; Lutsch, 2022; Jang,
2016; Bowers and Hiim, 2021). However, if we accept that nuclear weapons
represent an effective deterrence, [the]{.underline} abrupt
[disappearance of the US nuclear deterrent]{.underline} from Europe [may
**push countries to pursue their own nuclear weapons**.
Poland]{.underline}, for instance, [has been hinting at nuclear
ambitions]{.underline} since 2022 to counter Russia if NATO falters and,
more recently, has reiterated these plans4. [Ukraine]{.underline},
stripped of its Soviet- era nuclear weapons in 1994 under the Budapest
Memorandum, has similarly [voiced regret and interest in
rearmament]{.underline}, citing Russia's violation of security
guarantees5.

[Proliferation]{.underline}, however, [can promote **crisis
instability** and **arms races**]{.underline}. From a rational
perspective, [countries have]{.underline}, in fact, [an incentive to
**neutralise threats before they grow more acute**, and]{.underline}
thus [proliferation may **invite enemy attacks**]{.underline} (Fearon,
1995). For instance, [if Russia were faced with diffused nuclear
rearmament]{.underline} across Eastern Europe, [it might decide to
**intervene militarily by striking the development sites**, similarly to
what has happened against Iraq and Syria]{.underline}, and to what the
US and Israel have considered in relation to Iran (Raas and Long, 2007).
[This]{.underline}, in turn, [can invite other destabilising
actions]{.underline}, ultimately **[fuelling greater crisis
instability]{.underline}** (Bas and Coe, 2018).

### Germany\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Impact Defense

#### German prolif causes [Russia war]{.underline}, unravels [global nonproliferation efforts]{.underline}, and destroys the [EU]{.underline}.

Wolfgang **Ischinger 18**, Professor of Security Policy and Diplomatic
Practice at the Hertie School of Governance, Chairman of the Munich
Security Conference, former German Ambassador to the United States,
"Germany's Dangerous Nuclear Flirtation," Project Syndicate, 08-08-2018,
https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/germany-nuclear-weapon-debate-by-wolfgang-ischinger-2018-08

As in a game of chess, there are geopolitical moves through which a
country can -- unwittingly -- checkmate itself. Opening a debate on
German nuclear weapons would be such a move. Yet this is exactly what
some Germans have recently proposed. Supporters of a nuclear-armed
Germany contend that NATO's nuclear umbrella has lost all credibility
because of statements made by US President Donald Trump.

There are at least three good reasons why [considering a nuclear option
would be **foolhardy for Germany**]{.underline}. For starters,
[Germany]{.underline} has [repeatedly renounced it]{.underline}, first
in 1969 [by signing]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} later
[ratifying]{.underline}) [the]{.underline} Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ([NPT]{.underline}),
[and]{.underline} then in 1990 by signing [the]{.underline} so-called
[Two Plus Four Treaty]{.underline}, which paved the way for German
reunification. [Casting doubt on these]{.underline} commitments
[would]{.underline} severely [**damage Germany's rep**utation **and
reliability**]{.underline} worldwide. [Germany would call into question
the credibility of **NATO**'s nuclear deterrence, and]{.underline} thus
[**the alliance itself**, along with the **entire nuclear
non-prolif**eration **regime**]{.underline}.

It is worth noting that since its creation in 1949, NATO has been one of
the world's most successful instruments of proliferation prevention. Not
a single NATO member state -- apart from the United States, the United
Kingdom, and France -- has found it necessary to acquire nuclear weapons
of its own. [If Germany were now to break out]{.underline} of its
non-nuclear power status, [what would keep **Turkey** or
**Poland**]{.underline}, for instance, [from **follow**ing
**suit**]{.underline}? Germany as a gravedigger of the international
non-proliferation regime -- who could want that?

Second, [a German nuclear bomb would damage]{.underline} the strategic
environment in [Europe]{.underline} -- to Germany's disadvantage.
[Russia would interpret German steps toward a nuclear arsenal as a
**direct threat**]{.underline} to its own national security [and
would]{.underline} likely [adopt]{.underline} military [countermeasures.
That]{.underline}, in turn, [would make it even harder to
pursue]{.underline} the vision [of a pan-European order of peace and
security]{.underline}, a core foreign-policy goal of all German
governments since that of Konrad Adenauer. Moreover, [a German nuclear
ambition might **jeopardize the delicate balance of power in
Europe**]{.underline} -- including [between Germany and
France]{.underline}, for example -- [with incalculable consequences
for]{.underline} the long-term cohesion of [the **E**uropean
**U**nion]{.underline}.

Finally, it is not hard to predict that the pursuit of nuclear weapons
would draw significant public opposition, especially given that such a
move would be a complete about-face for German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's government, which, just a few years ago, moved to phase out
nuclear energy altogether. [It is difficult to imagine a **greater
fiasco**]{.underline} for German foreign and security policy [than
proposing a nuclear strategy]{.underline} and then failing to obtain
parliamentary approval.

Worst of all, [the pursuit of a German nuclear arsenal]{.underline},
rather than deterring aggression, [could **increase the risk of conflict
in Europe**]{.underline}, since [Russia would]{.underline} likely [work
to prevent Germany from acquiring the bomb. Moscow could assassinate
German]{.underline} nuclear [scientists, use
**cyberattacks**]{.underline} to sabotage German nuclear industrial
infrastructure, [and]{.underline} perhaps go so far as to [**strike
German nuclear facilities from the air**. Even covert
operations]{.underline} could [**quickly spiral** into **outright
confrontation**]{.underline}.

[Even if Germany managed to acquire **nuc**lear weapon**s**, it would
then face the daunting task of making sure they could survive a Russian
attack]{.underline}. In recent years, Russia has moved its missiles
westward, targeting Germany and other NATO members. Now that [Russia

States agreed to abandon midrange missiles, [its ability to destroy a

Unless Germany managed to conceal and protect its nuclear

#### All medium-sized nations would proliferate.

pointless debate on nuclear weapons," Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 02-19-2024,
https://www.nzz.ch/english/the-last-thing-europe-needs-is-nuclear-weapons-ld.1814462

A second argument concerns hurdles under international law. With the
exception of France, [**all EU states** have committed to renouncing
nuclear weapons in the]{.underline} Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
([NPT]{.underline}). [And in the **Two Plus Four Treaty**]{.underline}
-- the basis for reunification in 1990 -- [**Germany** also **renounced
the possession of nuc**lear weapon**s**. A German atomic bomb
would]{.underline} therefore [be seen]{.underline} in Moscow [as a
**serious breach of the treaty**. It would]{.underline} also [be
extremely stupid]{.underline} for the Europeans [to withdraw from the
NPT, as this would trigger a **chain reaction in the Middle East** and
the **Pacific**]{.underline} region. [Any medium-sized nation would have
to **seriously consider nuclear armament**]{.underline}.

#### Nuclear sharing destroys the EU.

University of Antwerp, Ph.D. in International Politics from KU Leuven,

There are two reasons why the issue of the Eurobomb is only sporadically
touched upon: first of all, many observers of European security,
especially in the US, the UK and Eastern Europe, do not believe in
further defense integration in the EU, let alone a European army, and
for that reason perceive a Euro-bomb as unrealistic. According to these
voices, [Europe continues to rely on NATO, including]{.underline} on
[the US nuclear umbrella]{.underline} (Rühle and Rühle 2017). Secondly,
[apart from France, there is a **strong anti-nuclear tendency in Western
Europe**, certainly amongst the general public. Even if a European army
is seen as a preferable goal]{.underline} by many Western European
citizens, [that does not mean]{.underline} that [they are]{.underline}
also [in favor of Europeanizing the French nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
That is also the reason why some predict that [if the Eurobomb is
realized, it will be done in secret]{.underline} (Fischer 2017a;
Tertrais 2019, 61). [The latter]{.underline}, however, [may
**undermine** the **legitimacy** of European defense integration **and
the E**uropean **U**nion project **as such**]{.underline}.

#### It destroys the EU.

Adérito **Vicente 18**, Ph.D. candidate in Political and Social Sciences
at the European University Institute, "Euro-nukes? A difficult but
perhaps necessary debate," European Leadership Network, 12-07-2018,
https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/euro-nukes-a-difficult-but-perhaps-necessary-debate

Fourth, and perhaps most vital for the EU as a global actor, [it is not
desirable for Europe]{.underline} politically [to constitute its own
nuclear force. The idea of Euro-nukes may affect the **promotion of
interests and values** with third-party actors and member
states]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the rejection of the
**non-prolif**eration norm could **diminish EU's legitimacy
internally**]{.underline}, particularly at a time [when public opinion
remains doubtful over the rationale for nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

Secretary of Defense [Pete Hegseth met with his German Defense
counterpart]{.underline}, Federal Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius on
July 14 [and reaffirmed the strong relations between the two **NATO
allies**]{.underline}.

In his welcoming remarks to Minister Pistorius, [Secretary Hegseth
noted]{.underline}, \"I [think we\'ve seen incredible progress inside
**NATO** and with **Germany**]{.underline} taking the leap on that
upfront commitment to your spending, commitment to European
leadership.\"

"I want to commend you and thank you for that --- to include the
contributions and the partnership that we\'ll continue to undertake," he
said.

Secretary Hegseth told the German Minister that the [US is grateful for
the support the **German government** gives to **American troops**
stationed in **Germany**]{.underline}. \"Thank you for many years of
partnership and friendship in that regard,\" he said.

Prior to his meeting with Minister Pistorius, Secretary Hegseth joined
President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, other US officials and
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House, to discuss how the
U.S. plans to support Ukraine going forward.

That plan involves the U.S. providing weapons to Ukraine, which NATO
will pay for. In the interim, President Trump said, [Germany has agreed
to **provide** some of its own missiles to **Ukraine**, which NATO will
**eventually replace**]{.underline}.

Germany, along with nearly every other NATO partner, has also recently
committed to spending 5 percent of its gross domestic product on its
defense, which greatly enhances NATO. And Secretary General Rutte added
that [Germany has stepped up \"**massively**\" to help keep Ukraine
strong and to increase defense **industrial production**]{.underline}.

\"[I look forward to **further partnership**]{.underline},\" [Secretary
Hegseth told his **German counterpart**]{.underline}, [noting Germany\'s
commitment to **European** **security**]{.underline} by putting a
brigade in Lithuania, and its commitment to buy fifth generation fighter
jets from the U.S. In 2022, Germany agreed to buy 35 F-35 aircraft.

[Through a long-**standing partnership**, **Minister** **Pistorius**
said]{.underline}, [the U.S. and Germany have not only strengthened
their **own security, but** also the security of **other
partners**]{.underline}.

\"[Germany and the United States share a long-standing, deep and
**trusted partnership**]{.underline} --- a partnership that strengthens
not only our two nations, but also benefits the entire transatlantic
alliance,\" he said.

#### Relations are [improving]{.underline}.

**Kirby '25** \[Paul; July 18; Europe digital editor; BBC, "Germany\'s
Merz tells BBC Europe was free-riding on US,"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg6v0pk964o; Accessed 7.18.25\]

German Chancellor [Friedrich Merz has accepted **US accusations** that
Europe was doing **too little** to fund its own defence and security,
but now believes they are on the **same page**]{.underline}.

\"[We know we have to do more on our own and we have been
**free-riders** in the **past**]{.underline},\" he told the BBC\'s Today
Programme, \"[they\'re asking us to do **more** and we are **doing
more**]{.underline}.\"

Merz was in the UK to boost defence ties with Germany, as part of an
historic friendship treaty that also aims to tackle irregular migration
and promote youth exchanges.

Russia\'s war with Ukraine has framed the early weeks of his
chancellorship, as has US President Donald Trump\'s threat to impose 30%
import tariffs on European Union exports from 1 August.

[Merz told Nick Robinson, in his first UK **broadcast intervie**w as
chancellor, that he had now met Trump three times and they were on
**good speaking terms**]{.underline}: \"[I think President Trump is on
the same page; we are trying to **bring this war** to an
**end**]{.underline}.\"

\"[We are on the phone **once** a **week**;]{.underline} [we are
**co-ordinating** our **efforts**.]{.underline} One issue is the war in
Ukraine, and the second is our trade debates and tariffs.\"

#### Merz [maintains]{.underline} the Alliance.

**Mead '25** \[Walter Russel; Updated July 14; Distinguished Fellow in

[Mr. Merz]{.underline}, [a **successful** **businessman**]{.underline},
[may have an **easier time** understanding the **American president**
than do career politicians with less feel for the private
sector]{.underline}. [Knowing that a **working relationship** with Mr.
Trump was a **key** to his **success**]{.underline} overall, [the new
German chancellor has tended the bilateral relationship
**assiduously**]{.underline}. At his first Oval Office meeting, Mr. Merz
presented the president with a gold-framed copy of Mr. Trump's
grandfather's German birth certificate. [Mr. Merz has **refused to
criticize** Mr. **Trump** in public]{.underline} and has nothing but
nice things to say about their telephone conversations.

Bucking a tide of anti-Israel and anti-American sentiment in Europe,
[Mr. Merz was extremely supportive both of **Israel's w**ar against
**Iran** and of **Trump's backing** for the Jewish state]{.underline}.
He praised Israel's strikes against Iran, calling them "dirty work that
Israel is doing for all of us." Mr. Merz was clear about Iran's
intentions: "The evidence that Iran is continuing on its path to
building a nuclear weapon can no longer be seriously disputed." And his
reaction to Mr. Trump's decision to join Israeli military action in Iran
was equally unambiguous: "There is no reason for us, or for me
personally, to criticize what Israel started a week ago, nor is there
any reason to criticize what America did last weekend."

[Mr. Merz's style reflects a return to the conservative and **pragmatic
approach** that made West Germany **America's most reliable
ally**]{.underline} in Continental Europe during the early decades of
the Cold War. Conservative chancellors like Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig
Erhard supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
trans-Atlantic alliance through thick and thin. France might dream
Gaullist dreams of independence and autonomy, but with East Germany
under Moscow's control, German conservatives believed the American
alliance was their one hope of safety.

[Mr. Merz seems to see the world in **similar terms**]{.underline}.
Vladimir Putin may not pose the same threat to Germany that Joseph
Stalin did when the Red Army camped in the ruins of Berlin, but Mr.
[Putin's growing power and evident hostility mean that **America**
**matters** more for **German security**]{.underline} than it has since
the end of the Cold War. [Mr. Trump has made clear that **America's
continuing engagement** in Europe can't be taken **for
granted**]{.underline}. [Mr. Merz **understands** that and is **acting
accordingly**]{.underline}.

There was another reason German leaders supported the American alliance
in the early Cold War. After Germany launched the two most brutal wars
in European history in 1914 and 1939, its neighbors understandably
didn't trust it. Many in Britain and France opposed German rearmament
during the 1950s but were reassured by the continuing presence of the
Americans.

[The American alliance]{.underline} did more than keep the Russians out
of Europe. It [brought the **Germans** **in**]{.underline}. West Germany
was able to regain the trust of its neighbors and build the cooperative
relationships that promoted German prosperity and, eventually, German
and European unity.

That history could become relevant again. [A Germany that **modernizes**
its **military** and seriously commits to putting 5% of GDP toward
defense would soon have]{.underline}, by far, [the strongest military in
the **E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}. A continued American engagement
in European security will again reassure Germany's neighbors that they
don't have to worry about an overmighty Berlin.

In any case, [Friedrich Merz appears to understand both the
**importance** and the fragility of the **American** **alliance** better
than his recent predecessors did]{.underline}. There are tests ahead,
but [Mr. Merz's hard-headed, **pragmatic conservatism** may be just what
the trans-Atlantic **alliance** **needs** at a difficult
time]{.underline}.

[The Arctic, long perceived as a remote and inhospitable expanse, has
undergone a dramatic transformation in recent decades]{.underline}. Sea
ice retreat has unlocked vast economic opportunities, new shipping
routes, untapped energy reserves, and critical mineral deposits while
simultaneously [exposing the region to heightened geopolitical
risks.]{.underline} [For the United States, an Arctic nation through
Alaska, the High North represents both a strategic asset and a
vulnerability, necessitating a robust and collaborative approach to its
security. Though lacking Arctic territory, Germany has emerged as an
indispensable partner in this endeavor]{.underline}, leveraging its
status in NATO, a leader in the European Union (EU), and a close U.S.
ally to contribute to regional stability. [This partnership has gained
urgency in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}
and China's expanding Arctic ambitions, events that have reshaped the
security landscape of the Arctic. [Germany's policy shift, encapsulated
in the 2022 "Zeitenwende" (times-turn or turning point), has broadened
its usual scientific and environmental focus in the Arctic]{.underline}
to emphasize energy, defense, and security, aligning closely with U.S.
objectives. The U.S., meanwhile, views the Arctic as a critical
component of its national security (White House, 2025), with the
Department of Defense identifying it as a potential theater for great
power competition (U.S. Department of Defense, 2021). [Together, these
nations are fortifying transatlantic resilience through joint patrols
with US and Nordic allies in key areas like the GIUK gap, countering
emerging threats from Russia's militarized Arctic bases to China's
investments in infrastructure and shipping. The stakes in the Arctic are
immense.]{.underline} The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the
region contains 13% of the world's undiscovered oil, 30% of its
undiscovered natural gas, and significant reserves of rare earth
elements critical for advanced technologies (Gautier et al., 2009). New
maritime routes, such as the Trans-Arctic Route (TSR), could reduce
shipping times by 50% (Bennett et al, 2020), and the Northern Sea Route
(NSR) promises to cut shipping times between Europe and Asia by up to
40%, [reshaping global trade dynamics]{.underline} (Humpert, 2014).
However, [risks shadow these opportunities]{.underline}, and actual
savings depend on future ice conditions and navigational feasibility,
[with potential variations due to operational challenges]{.underline}.
[Russia understands the value of the Arctic and has bolstered its Arctic
presence with advanced missile systems and submarines and reopened
Soviet-era bases, threatening NATO's northern and western
flanks]{.underline} (Pezard et al., 2020). Hoping to gain a foothold in
the Arctic, [China has pursued economic projects like the Polar Silk
Road,]{.underline} raising concerns about its long-term intentions
(Lanteigne, 2014[). In this complex environment, U.S.-Germany
collaboration offers a multifaceted response]{.underline}, [integrating
military cooperation, economic alignment, and diplomatic leadership to
ensure the Arctic remains a zone of stability rather than
conflict]{.underline}. Germany's role, while distinct from that of
Arctic states, is grounded in its strategic position within NATO and the
EU[. Historically, Berlin's Arctic engagement focused on scientific
research, exemplified by initiatives like the MOSAiC expedition, which
advanced global understanding of climate dynamics (Alfred Wegener
Institute, 2020). However, the Zeitenwende has marked a turning point,
with Germany's 2023 National Security Strategy explicitly framing Arctic
stability as a NATO priority and pledging enhanced cooperation with
Arctic allies]{.underline} (Federal Foreign OYice, 2023). [This shift
recognizes that developments in the High North, whether Russian naval
activity in the Greenland-Iceland-UK]{.underline} (GIUK) gap or Chinese
investments in Greenland, [directly impact European and transatlantic
security]{.underline}. For the U.S., [Germany's contributions strengthen
the transatlantic alliance]{.underline}, [directly supporting America's
interests]{.underline} by providing logistical support, maritime
capabilities, and diplomatic weight in the Arctic -- [a region critical
to US security]{.underline}, where acting alone isn't enough. Moreover,
[Germany can leverage its proximity and E.U. influence to shape policy
and economic engagement in the European Arctic]{.underline}, such as
fostering sustainable development or countering Chinese infrastructure
bids, in a way the U.S., as a non-E.U. power geographically distant from
the region, cannot. Military, Governance, and Economic Dimensions of
U.S.-Germany Collaboration The U.S.-Germany partnership in the Arctic
operates across three interlocking domains: military cooperation,
governance and policy, and economic strategy. Each dimension reflects a
shared commitment to countering threats, seizing opportunities, and
upholding a stable, rules-based order in the High North. Strengthening
NATO's Northern and Western Flanks [At the heart of U.S.-Germany
military collaboration lies their shared commitment to
NATO]{.underline}, which has designated the Arctic and North Atlantic as
critical theaters for collective defense. [The U.S. brings unparalleled
Arctic expertise through its Alaskan bases, Coast Guard icebreakers, and
Northern Command, while Germany contributes maritime and logistical
capabilities that enhance NATO's reach. Russia's militarization of the
Arctic, evidenced by its deployment of S-400 missile systems and nuclear
submarines along the Kola Peninsula]{.underline}, [has heightened the
need for a robust allied presence]{.underline} (Conley et al., 2020).
Joint exercises like NATO's 2018 Trident Juncture, conducted in northern
Norway with 50,000 troops, showcased this synergy, [with German
infrastructure facilitating the rapid deployment of U.S. and allied
forces]{.underline} (NATO, 2018). Similarly, the 2022 Cold Response
exercise saw German naval and air units train alongside 26 NATO nations
in Arctic conditions, refining their interoperability in extreme
environments (NATO, 2022). [Germany's maritime contributions are
particularly significant. The German Navy has shifted focus to the North
Atlantic and Arctic-adjacent waters, patrolling key gaps and seams like
the GIUK gap alongside U.S. and Nordic allies.]{.underline} Following
the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage, Germany deployed frigates and
supply ships to Norwegian waters to protect critical infrastructure,
including oil rigs and undersea cables, underscoring its role in NATO's
deterrence posture (Arctic Today, 2022). Bilaterally, Germany and Norway
are collaborating on a new and improved submarine, the Type U212CD, a
stealth vessel designed for Arctic operations, with delivery expected by
2029 (Thales, 2023). In 2024, the German Navy's U-36 submarine
participated in Exercise Arctic Dolphin, a multinational anti-submarine
warfare drill oY Norway, enhancing NATO's ability to counter Russian
underwater threats (Navy Leaders, 2025). [The U.S. complements these
efforts with its deployments, including P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol
aircraft and Virginia-class submarines]{.underline}, which monitor
Russian naval movements in the Arctic Ocean (U.S. Department of Defense,
2021). Germany is set to bolster this capability by acquiring P-8
Poseidons, replacing aging P-3C Orions, and [aligning its anti-submarine
warfare capacity with U.S. standards]{.underline} (Federal Foreign
OYice, 2023). On land, Germany's hosting of NATO's Joint Support and
Enabling Command in Ulm ensures rapid reinforcement of the High North
during crises, a role tested in exercises like Trident Juncture (NATO,
2018). Looking forward, Germany's 2023 National Security Strategy
commits to designating Bundeswehr units for Arctic duties and expanding
cold-weather training, reflecting a long-term investment in High North
security (Federal Foreign OYice, 2023). Upholding a Rules-Based Order
Beyond military power, U.S.-Germany collaboration extends to governance,
where both nations advocate for a multilateral framework to manage
Arctic challenges. [The U.S., as an Arctic Council member, and Germany,
an observer since 1998, view the Council as a cornerstone for dialogue
and cooperation]{.underline} (Federal Foreign OYice, 2019). Germany's
2023 Arctic Policy Guidelines emphasize working "closely with allies and
partners to guarantee security and stability," primarily through NATO
and the EU (Federal Foreign OYice, 2023). Both nations staunchly endorse
UNCLOS as the legal bedrock for Arctic governance, advocating its use to
resolve territorial disputes and regulate maritime activities, a stance
critical amid overlapping claims in the central Arctic Ocean (Federal
Foreign OYice, 2023). [Germany has shaped a unified Arctic policy within
the EU, influencing the 2021 EU Arctic Strategy's focus on
sustainability and opposition to unregulated resource
extraction]{.underline} (European Commission, 2021). [Berlin's advocacy
for an Arctic oil and gas drilling ban, aligned with Paris Agreement
goals, has sparked debate but underscores its environmental
concerns]{.underline} (High North News, 2023). Washington's focus is on
energy and national security [interests to strengthen the United States
and its alliance]{.underline} (Rosen, 2025; DeVore, 2025). Post-2022,
[both nations joined the other seven Arctic states in suspending
cooperation with Russia in the Council]{.underline}, redirecting efforts
toward "like-minded partners" to sustain governance initiatives
(Østhagen, 2024). Germany's participation in forums like the Arctic
Security Forces Roundtable and its observer status at Nordic Chiefs of
Defense meetings further deepen its governance role (U.S. European
Command, 2023). [It promotes confidence-building measures, such as the
Arctic Coast Guard Forum and the Polar Code,]{.underline} [while voicing
concerns about Russia's military buildup and China's ambitions through
diplomatic channels]{.underline} (Federal Foreign OYice, 2023). The
U.S., meanwhile, leads efforts to integrate Finland and Sweden into
NATO's Arctic framework, a process Germany supports through logistical
and political backing (Federal Foreign OYice, 2023). Together, they
foster a governance model prioritizing peace, sustainability, and
cooperation over confrontation. Securing Resources and Trade Routes
Economically, the U.S. and Germany align to harness the Arctic's
potential while mitigating its risks. The region's critical minerals,
rare earths, cobalt, and nickel are vital for their high-tech economies,
with Greenland and Northern Canada emerging as key sources (Hammond,
2023). The 2022 Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a U.S.-led
coalition including Germany, targets "friend-shoring" these resources
with Arctic allies to counter China's dominance in the rare earth market
(Reuters, 2022). Germany's 2023 Arctic Policy Guidelines highlight this
as a priority, with joint U.S.-Germany funding supporting mining
ventures in Greenland that adhere to high environmental standards
(Pulitzer Center, 2022). [Shipping routes like the NSR offer another
economic frontier]{.underline}. For Germany, a trading nation, these
lanes could elevate Hamburg as a global hub, while the U.S. seeks to
ensure freedom of navigation (Humpert, 2014). Both nations insist these
routes remain open and governed by UNCLOS, with Germany pioneering green
ice-class vessels to meet strict environmental standards (Federal
Foreign Office, 2023). In energy, Germany has shifted to Norwegian
Arctic gas following the curtailment of Russian imports. At the same
time, the U.S. is exploring an all-energy sources solution, such as oil
leasing in Arctic waters oY Alaska, prioritizing energy security and
economic development (Alaska Beacon, 2025). Naval deployments, including
Germany's P-8 Poseidon investments and U.S. Coast Guard patrols, secure
these sea lanes, particularly after the 2022 pipeline attacks heightened
infrastructure vulnerabilities (Gosnell & Thomas, 2024). Conclusion The
U.S.-Germany partnership in the Arctic is a testament to the power of
transatlantic cooperation in addressing the region's multifaceted
challenges. Militarily, their NATO-based collaboration deters
aggression, protects infrastructure, and ensures readiness in a
contested domain. In governance, their advocacy for a rules-based order
through the Arctic Council, UNCLOS, and the EU counters destabilizing
influences, promoting stability and sustainability. Economically, their
alignment secures critical resources and trade routes, reinforcing
transatlantic prosperity amid global competition. As the Arctic's
strategic importance grows, this alliance serves as a vital anchor,
transforming a region of risk into one of opportunity. Far from being
short-term and expedient, the multi-decadal U.S.-Germany collaboration
in the Arctic is a long-term strategic endeavor, safeguarding the Arctic
and supporting global security and resilience. [As the Federal Republic
of Germany plans its future investments in defense and security, it
should consider the Arctic, a region of growing strategic importance, to
further expand and enhance its contributions]{.underline}

BERLIN---[President Trump's embrace of Russia is causing Europeans to
**rethink** their security and giving currency to an idea the U.S. has
long sought to avoid]{.underline}: [a **nuclear-armed
Germany**.]{.underline}

[Friedrich Merz]{.underline}, who is [poised to become Germany's **next
chancellor**]{.underline}, [said Berlin should start talks about
expanding the French and British nuclear deterrents to **cover
Europe**]{.underline}, according to an interview the conservative
politician did with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung weekly.

[Asked if Germany should pursue its **own arsenal**, Merz **didn't rule
it out**]{.underline}, saying there "there is no need for this today."

[The remarks broke with a **longstanding taboo**]{.underline}, [showing
how violently the **foundations** of Germany's and Europe's security are
being **shaken**]{.underline}. Merz is still negotiating to form a
government and has yet to be elected chancellor, [but a German leader
had not called for an **alternative** to the **U.S.** nuclear deterrent
in Europe since the end of the **Cold War**]{.underline}.

After World War II, the Federal Republic of Germany was welcomed into
the Western alliance as a bulwark against the Soviet bloc. Yet unlike
France and the U.K., it renounced pursuing its own nuclear weapons and
was welcomed instead under the American nuclear umbrella.

[U.S. tactical nuclear weapons are now stored at the Büchel Air Base in
**western Germany**]{.underline}, ready to be deployed by the German Air
Force should the U.S. president give the order.

[The U.S. hasn't said that it wants to **pull troops out** of

now seeking a detente with Russia's **autocratic leader**, **Vladimir
Putin**]{.underline}, which some analysts say might have irreparably
damaged the credibility of the U.S. deterrent in Europe.

"[Why should Putin think in case of an escalation in Europe that Trump
would use a **nuclear response**]{.underline}? [Every step Trump has
taken **suggests otherwise**]{.underline}," said Maximilian Terhalle, a
political scientist and visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution at

[It's not just Moscow that has Western European countries rethinking
nuclear deterrence]{.underline} --- **[it's Washington]{.underline}** as
well. The debate over "Euronukes" is not new, but recent events have
given it greater urgency. "The French have been talking about this since
the '90s," said Heather Williams, director of the Project on Nuclear
Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "[What's
different now is]{.underline} a couple of things. The first thing that's
different is that there is [a war going on in Europe]{.underline}. The
second thing is Donald Trump."

It's not hard to understand why. [Trump is an **outspoken critic of
defense guarantees**]{.underline} in general, which he argues encourages
free-riding and reckless behavior by allies at America's defense, and
NATO in particular. As president he discussed pulling the US out of NATO
altogether and onetime advisers like former national security adviser
John Bolton have said he would likely have done so if he had been
reelected in 2020.

Last year, [Congress passed legislation **prevent**ing a future
president from pulling the US out]{.underline} of the alliance
[without]{.underline} congressional [approval]{.underline}, but that
wouldn't prevent Trump from simply refusing to fulfill US obligations
under the alliance, including Article 5. During a meeting in 2020, Trump
reportedly told European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, "You
need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to
help you and to support you." More recently, he has said he would let
Russia "to do whatever the hell they want" to European countries that
were "delinquent" by not meeting their NATO-mandated 2 percent of GDP
defense spending targets.

In light of this, the old Cold War question has returned. "If there were
to be President Trump back in the White House next January, and if we
\[Europeans\] were to ask ourselves the question, 'Is Trump going to
risk Chicago for Berlin?' I think it would be quite difficult to answer
that question except in the negative," said Nick Witney, a defense
policy analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "And then
[you]{.underline} really [have to wonder what the US nuclear guarantee
is worth]{.underline}."

[When it comes to a potential independent European nuclear deterrent,
the key country is **France**, which]{.underline}, since Brexit, [is the
only country in the EU with its own **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline}. While [Britain's nuclear forces]{.underline}
--- which have been having a rough few weeks with a second failed
submarine missile launch tests --- [are assigned to NATO]{.underline}
and experts question whether its program could even survive without US
support, France has a fully independent deterrent, owing to de Gaulle's
old concerns about sovereignty and the value of US assurances. It does
not participate in NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, which sets deterrence
strategy for the alliance. France's nuclear deterrent is France's alone.

But back in 2020, [Macron raised eyebrows]{.underline} with a speech
[arguing]{.underline} that while [France's **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline} are solely for the purpose of defending
France's vital interests, those interests "now **[have a European
dimension]{.underline}**." He called for a dialogue with France's
European partners on the "role of French nuclear deterrence in our
collective security."

[Macron has repeatedly called for Europe to shore up its own defenses
and act more]{.underline} strategically [independent from the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, and in 2022, [his office affirmed]{.underline}
that [he was still open to]{.underline} "[Europeanizing]{.underline}"
[France's nuclear deterrent, suggesting he was open to **extending
France's own nuclear umbrella**]{.underline} to its European partners.
Poland's new prime minister, Donald Tusk, expressed support for the
proposal last month.

Meanwhile, a host of [German politicians]{.underline} from across the
political spectrum, including Weber, [have been tentatively calling for
Germany to seek a European nuclear deterrent, **separate from the
U**nited **S**tates, **a major shift** for a country where public
opposition to]{.underline} military force in general and [**nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline} in particular [has been high for
decades]{.underline}.

Christian Lindner, Germany's finance minister and leader of the liberal
Free Democratic Party, recently argued in an op-ed that Germany should
give serious consideration to France's offer of dialogue on European
nuclear deterrence and that "we should understand Donald Trump's recent
statements as a call to further rethink this element of European
security."

Of course, [many Germans may not consider French security
guarantees]{.underline} to be **[all that more reassuring]{.underline}**
than American ones. One anonymous official recently told the Wall Street
Journal that Germany should be wary of a nuclear alliance with a country
that was "one election away" from electing a pro-Russian president,
referring to France's increasingly prominent far-right National Rally
party leader Marine Le Pen. [This]{.underline} has [led
some]{.underline} national security [experts in Germany to
argue]{.underline} that [the country should **look to acquire its own
nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}, which would be [held separately from
the US arsenals in the country]{.underline}.

That idea would be a tough sell for the German public. While the war in
Ukraine has caused many Germans to reevaluate their dislike of US
weapons on German soil, 90 percent of Germans oppose the country
acquiring nuclear weapons of its own.

At a meeting with reporters in Washington on Monday, Charles Fries, EU
deputy secretary general for peace, security, and defense, acknowledged
that the topic of an independent nuclear deterrent appeared to be
garnering more interest lately but said that as of now, "the debate has
not really taken place at the EU level."

Nukes --- what are they good for?

Underlying the Euronukes debate is the question of just how effective
nuclear weapons really are as a deterrent. As countries including Israel
and Pakistan have recently demonstrated, just having nukes is not a
guarantee of perfect safety. But they can be effective at deterring the
sort of threat --- a massive conventional invasion aimed at seizing
territory --- that Russia potentially poses.

For evidence, many would point at Ukraine itself. At the time of the
break-up of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had the world's third-largest
nuclear arsenal on its soil. As Ukrainian leaders including President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy have frequently pointed out, Ukraine "gave up" those
weapons to Russia in exchange for guarantees that its security would be
respected.

This talking point is slightly misleading: The weapons on Ukraine's soil
were under Moscow's operational control, just as the weapons in Europe
today are under Washington's, and Ukraine could not have actually used
them. But it has nonetheless taken hold as a powerful narrative about
the naivety of trusting diplomatic guarantees over hard military power.
The governments of Iraq and Libya also likely regretted abandoning their
nascent nuclear programs before being attacked by Western forces.

Europe is not the only place where these discussions are taking place.
South Korea, like NATO countries, is under the US nuclear umbrella,
having signed a mutual defense treaty with the United States in the
1950s. But with external threats growing (North Korea and China in this
case) and doubts about US credibility in the age of Trump, public
support for the country developing its own nuclear weapon is high.
Leaders of Saudi Arabia have openly said they will seek a nuclear
arsenal if Iran acquires one.

**[While]{.underline}** these **[countries may not go nuclear
overnight]{.underline}**, these [discussions]{.underline} seem to [augur
a world where nuclear strategy and brinkmanship are]{.underline} once
again **[at the center of global politics]{.underline}**. The dream
expressed in a formerly Communist Central European capital by an
American president just 15 years ago of a world without nuclear weapons
has never looked farther off.

#### Signals of disengagement cause [European prolif]{.underline}.

[Berlin could be **moving away** from its historic reliance on American
**nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}. Reports in the English-language
press suggest that [German defence officials are quietly
contacting]{.underline} their [British and French]{.underline} NATO
[counterparts to **prepare an alternative to the American nuclear
umbrella**]{.underline}.

[Potential American disengagement]{.underline} from Europe has [put
pro-NATO governments **on edge**]{.underline} across Europe. [Unease
about future changes]{.underline} at the White House [is]{.underline}
now [driving the German government to **formulate plans for obtaining
nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}. Senior members of the centre-right
CDU and ruling SPD call for a common European nuclear deterrent, ending
sole reliance on the U.S.

German elites are still reeling from comments made by Trump on the
campaign trail this month saying he would not respect Article 5
commitments to defend a NATO member under attack unless the country had
fulfilled its financial obligations to the alliance, adding to calls for
a more autonomous European pillar to NATO.

Currently governed by a disastrous liberal-left government under
Chancellor Scholz, [Germany has been inching towards remilitarisation
since Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Electoral pressure
caused by the rise of the populist AfD draws on hostility to Ukraine
policy, aggravated by the effects of sanctions on Germany's economy and
geopolitical standing alike.

[While Scholz and other high-ranking German ministers]{.underline}
(including Minister of Defence Boris Pistorius) [have **vetoed nuclear
armaments for now**, other politicians are urging Berlin to **rethink
its reliance on American nukes**]{.underline}. Liberal Finance Minister
Christian [Lindner tested the waters]{.underline} on a common European
nuclear shield in an op-ed published last month.

"Let us not deceive ourselves: [as long as there are nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in the world, [Europe will]{.underline} also
**[have to adhere to]{.underline}** a system of **[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}** in order not to be defenceless at the mercy of
the blackmail of authoritarian states" Lindner declared, commending
recent German deployments to Lithuania and push for a common EU defence
policy.

Western Germany has long been an American military bastion. An estimated
20 nuclear weapons are already stationed at Büchel Air Base in Germany.
The issue of nuclear weapons on German soil has historically been a
major rallying point for the anti-NATO Left and Right, despite the Green
Party dumping its historic opposition to militarisation.

[The potential lurch towards nuclear weapons comes **despite** Germany
being party to treaties on nuclear **non-prolif**eration]{.underline}.
Experts estimate [the country's industrial and scientific prowess would
give the country **nuc**lear weapon**s** in a **relatively short period
of time if required**]{.underline}. Ironically, Germany last year closed
its last nuclear power plant, thereby completing the phasing out of the
peacetime use of nuclear technology.

[Polling shows greater sympathy towards **nuc**lear weapon**s** in
Germany in light of the war in Ukraine, with a **majority of German
citizens** now supportive]{.underline} of their presence.

While Germany is front and centre in a drive for a common EU defence
policy, [the concept of Eurocrats getting access to nuclear weapons was
too much for some German MPs]{.underline}, who shot down the idea at a
meeting of the Bundestag Defence Committee earlier this month.

The German Ministry of Defence did not respond to press inquiries about
the rumoured plans at the time of publication.

### Germany\-\--Yes Prolif\-\--2NC

#### Germany will do [whatever it takes]{.underline}. 

Thorsten **Benner 25**, Co-Founder and Director of the Global Public
Policy Institute, "Germany Is Rethinking Everything Nuclear," Foreign
Policy, 03-11-2025, accessed 07-18-2025,

DG

[The]{.underline} incoming [German government, rattled by]{.underline}
the prospect of U.S. President Donald [Trump]{.underline} withdrawing
security guarantees, [is preparing a **fundamental readjustment** of its
defense posture]{.underline}. The new coalition of Christian Democrats
(CDU/CSU) and Social Democrats (SPD) has already agreed to push for
changes to the debt brake that would pave the way to dramatically higher
military spending. Germany's likely next chancellor, CDU leader
Friedrich [Merz]{.underline}, [stated]{.underline} that "[in view of the
threats to our freedom and peace on our continent]{.underline}," [the
government's new motto needs to be]{.underline} "**[whatever it
takes]{.underline}**."

[A litmus test]{.underline} for how serious these efforts are [is
whether the]{.underline} new [government will pursue a **Plan B** for a
possible end to the U.S. nuclear security umbrella]{.underline} for
Germany and Europe. [Berlin needs an **ambitious nuclear policy**
rethink]{.underline} that includes a push to recreate nuclear sharing at
the European level---with the continent's nuclear powers, France and the
U.K.---to deter Russia and other adversaries. [It is]{.underline} also
[essential for Germany to invest in **civilian nuclear
research**]{.underline} to maintain nuclear latency as a hedge.
Fortunately, **[Merz has signaled willingness to do both]{.underline}**.

As part of NATO nuclear sharing, Germany hosts about 20 U.S. B-61
nuclear bombs at the Büchel airbase. For much of the past few decades, a
majority of Germans were in favor of getting these nuclear weapons out
of Germany. This was part and parcel of the German desire to exit
everything nuclear, be it military or civilian. As late as mid-2021, a
survey published by the Munich Security Conference found that only 14
percent of Germans favored nuclear weapons on German soil.

Russia's invasion of [Ukraine led to a **dramatic shift** in public
opinion]{.underline}. In mid-2022, [52 percent of Germans]{.underline}
surveyed for Panorama magazine [expressed support for]{.underline}
keeping or even increasing [U.S. nuclear weapons]{.underline} in
Germany. Russia's attack against nonnuclear power Ukraine, which
included the threat of using such weapons to deter Europe and the United
States from supporting Kyiv, clearly left a mark on the German
population.

In light of such threats, it seems that a majority of Germans have
concluded that it is better to be directly under a nuclear umbrella.
After Russia's invasion, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz decided to pursue
a 10 billion euro (\$13.85 billion) deal with the United States to buy
F-35s to replace the aging Tornado fleet that would carry the U.S.
nuclear bombs stored at Büchel airbase. With this deal, [Scholz sought
to lock in U.S. commitments to German defense]{.underline}.

Of all recent German chancellors, Scholz probably pursued the closest
relationship with the Washington. He tried to stick to this path even
after the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. At the
Munich Security Conference in mid-February, Scholz said: ​"We will not
agree to any solution that leads to a decoupling of European and
American security."

That statement sounds decisive, but only if you ignore that the decision
to decouple from European security lies in the hands of the United
States. Berlin has no veto power here.

Scholz's likely successor, [Merz]{.underline}, strikes a very different
tone. Before official results had been announced on the night of the
Feb. 23 election, he [stated]{.underline}: "[My absolute priority will
be to **strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that**]{.underline},
step by step, **[we can]{.underline}** really **[achieve independence
from the USA]{.underline}**." [Merz]{.underline} also [said]{.underline}
that [it was unclear whether]{.underline} "[we will still be talking
about NATO in its current form]{.underline}" by the time of the bloc's
planned summit in June, "[or]{.underline} whether we will have to
establish [an **independent European defense capability**]{.underline}
much more quickly."

[Merz is **convinced**]{.underline} that [this needs to **include a Plan
B for the** possible **end of the U.S. nuclear umbrella**]{.underline}.
The chancellor-in-waiting has proposed discussions with France and the
U.K. on whether the two are willing to engage in a nuclear-sharing
arrangement with Germany.

That is a sea change in the German debate. Former Chancellors Angela
Merkel and Scholz had consistently ignored French President Emmanuel
Macron's offers to engage in a strategic dialogue on nuclear deterrence
in Europe. In a televised address on March 5, Macron responded
positively to what he referred to as Merz's "historic call." The French
president said that he had decided "to open the strategic debate on the
protection of our allies on the European continent by our \[nuclear\]
deterrent."

The [Merz-Macron alignment provides a solid political base for
discussions on Europeanizing nuclear sharing]{.underline} further. Of
course, there are many obstacles, risks, and unanswered questions, as
critics of these proposals in the German debate have been quick to point
out.

[It is easy to belittle]{.underline} "somewhat [panicky policy
suggestions]{.underline}" by an "increasing chorus of pundits and
policy-makers from across the mainstream political establishment that
fear US abandonment," **[as]{.underline}** German arms control
researcher **[Ulrich Kühn has done]{.underline}**. But [given the
havoc]{.underline} that the [Trump]{.underline} administration [has
caused]{.underline} in only seven weeks, **[it is not]{.underline}**
"**[panicky]{.underline}**" **[to think through a potential U.S.
exit]{.underline}** from the trans-Atlantic alliance. Not seriously
pursuing a Plan B would be grossly irresponsible at this point.

A first requirement is a shared vision of a realistic political
arrangement for Europeanizing extended deterrence and nuclear sharing.
One option would be to recreate NATO's nuclear planning group at the
European level, with France and the U.K. as its nuclear anchor powers.
To allow for U.K. participation, this should be done outside the formal
EU framework. At its core, the planning group should include a handful
of key European countries (Poland, Italy and Germany would be certain to
be among). The EU could be collectively represented through the European
Council president or the EU foreign affairs chief. Leaders of Germany
and Poland have already expressed openness to concrete nuclear sharing
arrangements, like having French capabilities stationed in German or
Polish soil.

Of course, the final decision on any nuclear weapons use would remain
with France and the U.K., as Macron also stressed during his comments on
March 5. This mirrors the current arrangement with the United States.
Members engaged in nuclear sharing would contribute financially to the
burden of maintaining the French and British nuclear arsenal.

#### Hostile security environment incents proliferation.

**Hoffer '25** \[Frank; March 26; non-executive director of the Global
Labour University Online Academy; Social Europe, "Germany Lifts Limits
on Military Spending Amid Nuclear Threat in Europe,"

Accessed 7.16.25\]

[Any country with **nuclear weapons** can invade others without fear of
**retaliation**]{.underline}. NATO bombed Belgrade to protect the
Kosovars from Slobodan Milosevic, but Vladimir Putin faces no similar
response for his aggression against Ukraine. The difference is stark:
[Russia possesses **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, making the bombing
of Moscow or St Petersburg unthinkable.

In Russia's invasion of Ukraine, nuclear weapons no longer function as
tools of deterrence aimed at preserving peace; [rather, they serve as a
protective shield enabling an illegal war of
**aggression**]{.underline}. While the war remains conventional, fear of
Russia's nuclear arsenal constrains NATO allies, preventing them from
supplying all the weapons Ukraine desires.

Nuclear deterrence effectively prevents war between nuclear states but
did not stop Russia from attacking Ukraine that had a far inferior
conventional army and lacked nuclear defences. NATO's mutual defence
clause, Article 5, has historically been interpreted as extending
America's nuclear protection to all members, since an attack on any NATO
state would trigger war with the nuclear-armed United States. Thus,
Article 5 serves both as a deterrent against Russia and as a guarantee
designed to halt nuclear proliferation. Particularly after the horrors
of the two World Wars, Western allies agreed on a security framework
that would render an independent German army, let alone German nuclear
weapons, unnecessary or impossible. As NATO's first Secretary-General,
Lord Ismay, famously put it, NATO was designed "to keep the Soviet Union
out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

[The deeply rooted unease]{.underline}, felt not only by Russians,
[about a militarily powerful and nuclear-capable unified **Germany** is
evident in the **Two Plus Four Agreement**]{.underline}: "The
governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic
Republic reaffirm their renunciation of the manufacture, possession, and
control of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons."

[Yet, the true strength of America's nuclear guarantee can only be
tested in actual **crisis**]{.underline}. French President Charles de
Gaulle famously questioned President Kennedy, asking whether the United
States would truly risk trading New York for Paris. De Gaulle himself
answered the question by developing France's independent nuclear
deterrent, the Force de Frappe.

[Although the United States has **not abandoned NATO**]{.underline},
[doubts similar to De Gaulle's became widespread in **Europe** under
**Donald Trump's** **presidency**]{.underline}. President Emmanuel
Macron has responded by offering an extension---or perhaps even an
alternative---to American nuclear protection under France's deterrent.
However, Macron remains unwilling to share decision-making authority
with other states. Would France genuinely "trade Paris for Berlin or
Warsaw"? Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister, remains
sceptical and does not rule out Poland pursuing its own nuclear
capabilities. He has argued that Poland must acquire "the most modern
capabilities related to nuclear and unconventional weapons," describing
this pursuit as "a race for security, not war."

[What would it mean for **Germany if Poland**]{.underline}---a [country
whose parliament, including members of Tusk's Civic Platform, recently
approved **reparations** demands against **Germany**]{.underline}
totalling €1.3 trillion---[could reinforce those demands with **nuclear
threats**]{.underline}? Conversely, can [Germany's neighbours
**realistically** desire a powerful German military if the **far-right**
**Alternative** für **Deutschland**]{.underline} (AfD) [could enter
government within **four years**]{.underline}? Furthermore, what becomes
of French protection if Marine Le Pen controls France's nuclear codes?

defense department put it: "Any adversary threatening the vital

the nuclear forces of both nations." The deal gives little detail on how
these two will cooperate, but it makes clear that they will.

"[The]{.underline} \[[United Kingdom]{.underline}\] [and France have a
deep history of defense collaboration]{.underline}, [and today's

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

[But this isn't really about France or]{.underline} Britain. The [man
who brought up the topic of **nuclear sharing** was German Chancellor
**Friedrich Merz**]{.underline}.

[The defense agreement is likely a **stepping stone** toward both
nations spreading their nuclear umbrella over **Germany**]{.underline}.

A European Dimension

On February 22, shortly before the German elections, Merz said, "[We
need to have discussions with both the **British** and the
**French**]{.underline}---the two European nuclear powers---[about
whether **nuclear sharing**]{.underline}, or at least nuclear security
from the UK and France, [could also **apply** to **us**]{.underline}."
In his election victory speech, Merz continued with this theme: "[My
absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible
so]{.underline} that, step by step, we [can **really achieve**
independence from the]{.underline} \[**[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates\]."

The day after he reached a general coalition agreement, he said,
"[**Sharing** **nuclear weapons** is an issue that we need to talk
about]{.underline}."

France responded. On March 5, Macron said: "Responding to the historic
call of the future German chancellor, I have decided to open the
strategic debate on the protection of our allies on the European
Continent through our (nuclear) deterrence."

France and Britain have been nuclear powers for over 65 years. But [it's
**only** in the weeks after the **German chancellor** brings up
**nuclear sh**aring that they sign a declaration on **sharing nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}.

[We're not the only ones to **spot** the **connection**]{.underline}.
"It's certainly a signal toward Russia, and other potential adversaries,
that the UK and France can consider nuclear retaliation in the event of
an attack, but not just on either of those two countries---[there's a
**European dimension** to this as well]{.underline}," said Lukasz Kulesa
of the Royal United Services Institute.

William Alberque of the Pacific Forum said this declaration "is [the
clearest and firmest statement we have **ever heard**]{.underline}" from
France "[about their willingness to provide nuclear deterrence for the
**rest** of **Europe**]{.underline}."

[Coordinating nuclear weapons with France is just a step toward

weapons**]{.underline}---[**exactly** as Merz has been **calling

The second administration of US President Donald Trump has brought about
tectonic shifts in the European security calculus. [Growing anxieties
about American retrenchment]{.underline} and the collapse of post-World
War II security arrangements have [sent European leaders scrambling to
put forward alternatives]{.underline}.

Ahead of the German elections last month, Friedrich Merz, the head of
the Christian Democratic Union, who was already expected to become the
next German chancellor, opined: "We need to have discussions with both
the British and the French -- the two European nuclear powers -- about
whether nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security from the UK and
France, could also apply to us".

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron said that in response to
Merz, he has decided to "open the strategic debate on the protection of
our allies on the European continent through our \[nuclear\]
deterrence".

[The proposal for]{.underline} some form of [European nuclear
sharing]{.underline} arrangement with France and the United Kingdom to
protect against threats from Moscow [is not new]{.underline}. Versions
of it have been floated around for decades.

[But]{.underline} today, [resurfacing this proposal is]{.underline} not
just a geopolitical miscalculation; it is [a **strategic dead
end**]{.underline}. It reflects [a misreading of both the nuclear
balance of power and the **existential risks** of fragmenting Europe's
security architecture further]{.underline}. Rather than bolstering
deterrence, [this gambit risks **accelerating**]{.underline} the very
**[instability]{.underline}** it seeks to avert.

Amid the growing unpredictability of United States-Russia relations
under the second Trump administration, [Europe must pivot from nuclear
escapism]{.underline} to a bold agenda of diplomatic engagement on
nuclear disarmament.

The fantasy of European nuclear sharing

[The proposal]{.underline} for European nuclear sharing [**founders on
arithmetic** and strategic reality. Russia's nuclear arsenal boasts
5,580 warheads]{.underline}, including hypersonic Avangard glide
vehicles and Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). [This
dwarfs the combined Anglo-French stockpile of 515 warheads]{.underline}.

This [asymmetry]{.underline} isn't merely quantitative; it [is also
doctrinal]{.underline}. Moscow's "**[escalate to
de-escalate]{.underline}**" strategy [represents a calculated approach
to]{.underline} conflict escalation designed to [coerce
adversaries]{.underline} into concessions. It is a strategy the [British
and French nuclear arsenals, optimised for minimal deterrence, **cannot
counter**]{.underline}.

Data on defence spending reveals a deeper flaw: [Europeans do not have
the funds or the technological capabilities to carry it out while
executing their ambitious rearmament plans]{.underline}.

Germany's 90.6-billion euro (\$98bn) military budget remains crippled by
inefficiencies, with only 50 percent of army equipment meeting NATO
readiness standards. Meanwhile, France and the UK lack the conventional
force multipliers -- global surveillance networks, intelligence
capabilities, or even complete nuclear triads -- that underpin US
extended deterrence. Even if every euro cent of the European Union's
recently announced 800 billion-euro (\$867 billion) defence boost were
spent on nuclear weapons programmes, cold-starting the sort of
production complexes required for a credible deterrent would still take
decades.

Attempting to replicate NATO's nuclear-coalition model at a European
level ignores six decades of integrated command structures and fails to
address hybrid threats now defining modern conflict.

What is more, [replacing one dependency with another solves
nothing]{.underline}. Proponents claim [nuclear sharing]{.underline}
offers protection, but the reality is that it [can lead to strat**egic
subjugation**]{.underline}.

[Neither France nor the UK is likely to give up control]{.underline}
over its nuclear arsenals [and transfer it to the EU]{.underline}. That
means that a [nuclear-sharing]{.underline} agreement [would reduce
Germany and other European countries participating]{.underline} in the
arrangement [to **Franco-British warhead warehouses** with no real
agency. This]{.underline} Potemkin deterrence---all ceremony, no
substance---[would]{.underline} only further **[irritate
Washington]{.underline}**.

Trump has already shown that he has no qualms about abandoning allies if
he sees no benefit for the US strategic interest. His recent moves to
stop intelligence sharing and military aid for Ukraine and his
conditioning mutual defence on military spending have exposed NATO's
fraying norms -- the alliance is witnessing a collapse of shared
purpose.

As experts note, Trump's "MAGA Carta" foreign policy explicitly rejects
strategic altruism. A European nuclear caucus would signal panic,
validating Trump's transactional world view while undermining NATO's
cohesion.

[A European nuclear club would deepen fragmentation,
emboldening]{.underline} revisionist actors like [**Russia and China**
while **diverting resources from**]{.underline} critical gaps in
**[AI]{.underline}** advancement, **[sustainable economic output, and
energy resilience]{.underline}** that define 21st-century power.

The economic argument compounds the folly. Pouring billions of euros
from Europe's finite resources into redundant warheads while neglecting
practical gaps in conventional capability isn't statecraft---it's
generational malpractice.

Disarmament and fiscal realpolitik

The EU's opportunity lies not in nuclear posturing, but in revitalising
arms control and mediation. The collapse of the US-Russia strategic
dialogue since the invasion of Ukraine has left critical arms control
frameworks in disarray.

The New START treaty, which limits deployed strategic nuclear warheads
to 1,550 each for Russia and the US, remains the last pillar of
bilateral arms control. Its expiration in 2026 without a successor would
mark the first time since 1972 that the world's nuclear superpowers
operate without mutually verified limits---a scenario that could trigger
a new nuclear arms race.

Herein lies Europe's opportunity. Rather than pursuing a European
nuclear umbrella, it could lead efforts to revive nuclear disarmament
dialogue.

Austria, an EU member, has already played a key role in nuclear talks
between the West and Iran as well as the 2020 US-Russia-China trilateral
arms control discussions. This positions it as an ideal venue for
restarting negotiations on nuclear risk reduction issues, especially at
a time when Washington is open to renewed dialogue with Moscow.

Taking a lead on nuclear disarmament would be the sort of leadership
that would reflect a more mature interpretation of security policy, as
opposed to seeking an impossible nuclear deterrence.

Some critics maintain that negotiating with Russia rewards aggression.
Yet history shows even bitter adversaries can cooperate on arms control
when interests align. The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,
which eliminated 2,692 missiles, was finalised after years of heightened
tensions between the USSR and the US in the early 1980s.

The treaty succeeded not because US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev trusted each other, but because dismantling
missiles saved both sides a significant amount of funds that would have
gone into continuing the arms race and maintaining the destroyed
ordinance.

Today, with Russia's economy faltering amid the war in Ukraine and
Trump's fixation with cost-cutting, there is an opportunity to pursue
another deal if disarmament is framed not as idealism, but as fiscal
pragmatism. Europe can help broker a deal that serves all parties'
wallets---and humanity's survival.

The unintended consequences of Trump's first-term nuclear gambits --
[escalated arms racing, eroded alliances, and emboldened
adversaries]{.underline} -- [offer cautionary lessons]{.underline}. His
second term, however, can offer an opportunity to shift the Doomsday
Clock back from its position of 89 seconds to midnight.

[Europe]{.underline} now [faces a choice]{.underline}: to [**cling to
Cold War relics while the planet burns**, or]{.underline} to [pioneer a
security paradigm prioritising **planetary survival**]{.underline} over
great-power vanity. [The decision it makes will define not just Europe's
future]{.underline}---[but **all of humanity's**]{.underline}.

### Nuclear Sharing\-\--Impact\-\--2NC

#### Succeeding [immediately]{.underline} causes Russia to [first strike]{.underline}.

for Europe? The prospect of a Trump victory is spurring a new debate

[Nuclear deterrence]{.underline} in relation to a country\'s own
territory, as practiced by Russia, China, India and Israel, [is credible
because it is about the country\'s own continued existence]{.underline}.
Only the U.S. has practiced the extension of such deterrence to other
sovereign states. It has done so from the 1950s to the present day, in
both Europe and Asia, as an important building block of the American-led
regional and global security order. The Soviet Union did take the Warsaw
Pact under its nuclear umbrella during the Cold War, but the countries
in question were not fully sovereign states.

[If France and/or the U.K. were to make such a promise for]{.underline}
all [EU]{.underline} and/or NATO [states, this would **by no means
constitute a deter**rent]{.underline} in itself. Deterrence requires not
only the declared intention to deter, it requires above all that the
other side actually feels deterred. The decisive factor in extended
deterrence is the credibility of the promise to maintain a nuclear
umbrella over others -- to treat the foreign territory to be protected
as one\'s own.

[Even in the case of the U.S.]{.underline}, this credibility was often
questioned, with good reason. But at the same time, **[nobody dared to
put Washington to the test]{.underline}**. This is [due to the
**U**nited **S**tates\' overall deterrent effect as the world\'s largest
military power]{.underline}, as well as the role it has played for
decades in maintaining global order.

[Neither France nor the U.K. can come]{.underline} even [**close to this
impact**. Nobody knows this better than the Kremlin]{.underline}. In one
way or another, [Russia would **immediately test a declared French or
British nuclear umbrella**]{.underline} over East-Central Europe.
[Moscow would assume]{.underline} that [Paris and London **would not
risk a nuclear war with Russia**]{.underline} in order to protect
Finland, the Baltic states or Romania.

Russia is waiting for opportunities

[An attempt]{.underline} by France and/or the U.K. to create a nuclear
umbrella over East-Central Europe would lead to considerable resistance,
even outside these countries. At the same time, it [would]{.underline}
probably [**immediately lead to a nuclear crisis**, because Russia would
see this as a **unique opportunity** to demonstrate]{.underline} that
[East-Central Europe no longer has]{.underline} any [nuclear
protection]{.underline}.

The result: [Only America can **credibly** and]{.underline} therefore
[**effectively** provide extended deterrence against Russia]{.underline}
(and in future probably also Iran) in Europe. The alternative to the
American nuclear umbrella is no nuclear umbrella.

If Europe were to lose the U.S. nuclear umbrella, the most likely
scenario would be that [states feeling particularly
threatened]{.underline} in East-Central Europe [would make **every
effort** to acquire]{.underline} at least [a minimal nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} capability as quickly as possible, in order to
defend themselves against an attack or intimidation by Russia, and thus
maintain their sovereignty.

In an extreme scenario, [such as stationing **French** or **British**
nuclear weapons in **Germany**]{.underline}, the limits of the NPT would
be stretched. [While Germany would not receive **direct control** over
the warheads, critics would argue that such a move **violates** the
**treaty**]{.underline}---in spirit or even its articles more
explicitly. Indeed[, it would constitute a new nuclear sharing
arrangement that was not provided for in the **NPT**]{.underline} and it
could even be at [odds with **France** and the **U**nited **K**ingdom's
obligations regarding **disarmament** if this new configuration required
increasing the size of their **nuclear arsenals**]{.underline}. [Russia
**recently tested** these boundaries by deploying nuclear weapons to
**Belarus**]{.underline}, sparking debate over the implications for the
treaty.

Less drastic shifts, [such as stationing French nuclear-armed aircraft
in Germany or other European allies who would express their
**interest**]{.underline}, might not directly challenge the
nonproliferation regime but [would likely feed
**criticisms**]{.underline}, [particularly amongst nonnuclear weapon
States in the **Global South**]{.underline}, [where double standards in
the West's approach to nuclear issues are **prevalent**]{.underline}.
Moreover, with Russia openly defying international law and China
criticizing U.S. nuclear extended deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, [any
change in Europe's nuclear posture could augment strategic risks in an
already **tense geopolitical environment**]{.underline}.

[Such a move could trigger **additional ripple effects**]{.underline}.
[Other regional powers might see it as justification for]{.underline}
strengthening their own extended deterrence arrangements---[or even
pursuing independent **nuclear arsenals**]{.underline}. Ukrainian
President Volodymyr [**Zelensky** has openly suggested that Ukraine
could seek nuclear weapons if **NATO** membership remains **out of
reach**]{.underline}. [Officials **in Saudi Arabia**, **South Korea**,
and Japan have made similar conditional statements about potential
**nuclear proliferation**]{.underline}. Keeping allies from obtaining
nuclear weapons has also long been a U.S. policy objective of extended
deterrence.

There are undoubtedly downsides to [European nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}. It [is expensive]{.underline} and will become
even more so when extended to others. France just rushed to reopen a
fourth nuclear airbase in response to Trump for \$1.7 billion.\" Paris
will soon feel the same pressure that Washington dealt with throughout
the Cold War-namely, [allies]{.underline} that [constantly demand
reassurance while never feeling fully reassured. **Russia could exploit
this**]{.underline} effect, [pushing Europeans into spending more and
more on nuclear arms]{.underline}.

That is why conventional deterrence matters so much. It is the most
costeffective and credible way to contain Russia. It also could have the
beneficial effect of bolstering Europe\'s defense industry and making
Europeans less dependent on U.S. military gear.

Establishing [a credible European nuclear deterrent will deliver a
**severe blow to the global nonprolif**eration **regime**. Member states

[French President **Emmanuel Macron** said on Tuesday that he was open
to discussing the potential **deployment** of his country\'s nuclear
weapons **elsewhere** in **Europe**]{.underline}.

The comments came in an interview with French broadcaster TF1 on Tuesday
evening.

[Macron noted that the **U**nited **S**tates already stations
**nuclear-armed aircraft** in **Europe**]{.underline}.

\"[The **Americans** have the bombs on planes in **Belgium**,
**Germany**, **Italy**, **Turkey**]{.underline},\" Macron said. \"We
[are ready to **open** this **discussion**]{.underline}.\"

\"I will define the framework in a very specific way in the weeks and
months to come,\" he said.

Macron lists conditions for sharing France\'s nuclear umbrella

In the interview, Macron made clear that any expansion of France\'s
nuclear deterrence to other European countries would be subject to
conditions.

France, the European Union\'s only nuclear power, wouldn\'t pay for the
security of others, and its own defense capabilities must remain fully
intact, he stressed.

Ultimate control over the use of the weapons would also remain solely
with the French president, Macron said.

France held around 280 nuclear warheads in 2024, according to figures
from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Its military has the power to launch these independently from its own
submarines or use jets to drop them from the sky.

Britain also has nuclear weapons, some 225 of which are stockpiled. But
the country\'s Trident nuclear submarine program is closely linked to
the US system and relies on the US for maintenance.

This raises \"concerns about \[Trident\'s\] independence,\" according to
UK think tank Chatham House.

[Germany and **others** open to French nuclear proposal]{.underline}

Marcon proposed back in March holding talks with European allies about
how French nuclear weapons could help protect Europe.

These [**comments** come as many European **leaders** feel they can no
longer rely on the **US\' nuclear commitment** to
**Europe**]{.underline} amid concerns of the Russian threat to the
continent.

Germany\'s Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also expressed interest in his
country hosting French nuclear weapons.

[He stressed]{.underline}, **[however]{.underline}**, at a joint press
conference with Macron in Paris last week, [that this would
be]{.underline} \"[**expressly** not a **substitute** for the nuclear
guarantee]{.underline} currently being given to Europe [by the
**U**nited **S**tates of **A**merica]{.underline}.\"

[UK-French nuclear co-operation is at the heart of the debate on how the
Europeans should **respond** to the weakening **US commitment** to
**Nato**]{.underline}. For 30 years, London and Paris have stuck to the
formula that the vital interests of one of them could not be threatened
without the vital interests of the other being engaged as well. But what
about the rest of Europe? As Merz said just before becoming chancellor:
"The [sharing of **nuclear weapons** is a subject we need to **talk
about**]{.underline} . . . [We have to be **stronger together** in
**nuclear deterrence**]{.underline}."

[The Northwood declaration's confirmation that the two countries
will]{.underline} "co-[ordinate across nuclear **policy**]{.underline},
capabilities and operations" [is a response to the concerns of
**Merz**]{.underline} and others. [Quite rightly, there is much
**ambiguity** in this **careful phrasing**]{.underline}. That is how
deterrence works. [But the overall message is **clear
enough**]{.underline}. [The new wording is more groundbreaking for
**France**]{.underline} ([which has always been **Delphic** about
whether its nuclear **deterrence** extends to its **European
partners**]{.underline}) than for the UK, whose nuclear weapons have
long been declared to Nato for the defence of all allies. Nonetheless,
it [is a powerful mark of the growing **strategic**

First, [there is **no nuclear consensus** within the EU
about]{.underline} the legitimacy of [nuclear deterrence]{.underline},
but rather a massive disagreement. Although Sweden has now given up its
anti-nuclear dalliance and is striving to join NATO, the neutral states
of [Ireland and Austria are]{.underline} still [**try**ing to discredit
nuclear deterrence at **every opportunity**]{.underline}. This means
that [the EU as a whole cannot be the]{.underline}
"[**own**er]{.underline}" of [a nuclear arsenal. Only a smaller
group]{.underline} of countries, and probably only the larger ones,
[would]{.underline} appear to be plausible owners of a joint nuclear
deterrent. [Since]{.underline} the United Kingdom's
"[Brexit]{.underline}," [the British nuclear arsenal is **no longer

argument]{.underline} that [Russia's aggression]{.underline} against
Ukraine [constituted a turning point]{.underline} for the defense of
Europe, **[any discussion]{.underline}** about a European nuclear force

Three months in, 20[**22** has proved to be a **momentous
year**]{.underline}, but hardly the first of such. History tends to
rhyme. So, [are we experiencing a **riff** on
**1918**---**pandemic**]{.underline}, inflation, **[global
war]{.underline}**, and the murder of the tsar? Is it 1812 again, only
instead of Napoleon's disastrous march to bring progress to Russia, we
are seeing Moscow's disastrous attempt to bring the 19th century to
Europe? [Or is it a mash-up of **1979**---the Kremlin's]{.underline}
fateful [invasion of Afghanistan---and 1962, the]{.underline}
brinksmanship of the **[Cuban Missile Crisis]{.underline}**?

Events in Ukraine are too raw to be playing parlour games, but
historical parallels can help us make sense of bewildering events. [2022
is shaping up to be a **pendulum year**---a point in time where a new
**global order** constitutes itself, but also where]{.underline} the
**[counterforces]{.underline}** to that order [start to **take
shape**]{.underline}. In other words, we are at a point when smart
observers can see both which way [the world]{.underline} is swinging and
how it [will **correct** itself]{.underline}.

And for **[Europe]{.underline}**ans, reading this moment correctly
matters, because we [need to be in the **vanguard** of the
counterforces]{.underline}.

The last pendulum year was 2001: Following Islamist terror attacks on
New York and Washington on September 11, Western governments subjected
Afghanistan to liberal state-building. The same year, the United States
brought China into the World Trade Organisation, genially propelling it
onto the path to becoming a market economy. And Western governments
pressed Russia to accept the Internet, an invention of the US military,
as a vector of worldwide openness and exchange. The mechanics of US
**[civilization]{.underline}** had become clear, but so too [had the
**seeds** of its **destruction**]{.underline}.

The Four Factors Driving World Affairs

At the start of 2022, I phoned colleagues in Brazil, South Korea, South
Africa, and Singapore. Everyone I chatted with corroborated views
prevalent in Europe about what is driving global affairs, naming much
the same four factors---bipolarity (the "G2" of China and the US),
geo-economics (attempts by governments to use industry for foreign
policy purposes), "sovereignization" (the reassertion of strong states
like Russia), and conflict black holes (Yemen, Libya)---and in roughly
that order of importance.

That straw poll suggests that people generally agree on which way the
world is swinging. Which is where pendulum theory comes in. According to
the theory, the global order swings back and forth looking for an
equilibrium. Global interdependence has historically gone in waves,
deepening and then receding. The world economy has repeatedly pushed out
to encompass new territories and societies. Then it has been pushed
back, before it expanded again, on a more politically inclusive footing,
looking for a stable order that suits all.

It's been obvious for some time that the pendulum is swinging back and
reversing the expansive momentum of the 2000s, but only this year have
the constitutive forces of the new order become clear. The pattern,
moreover, only really emerges if you compare 2022 to what are widely
seen as the two previous pendulum years of 2001, when Reaganite policies
finally peaked, and of 1980, when détente gave way to a deeper Cold War.

Already in January we were seeing evidence of this ebbing and flowing.
Today's structuring of the global economy around bipolar US-Chinese
rivalry replaces the heavy-handed US unipolarity of 2001, which in turn
corrected the bipolar division of world affairs in 1980 between the US
and the USSR. Today's attempts by governments to use commercial
technology for geo-economic purposes corrects the commercialization of
military technologies like the Internet and drones in 2001, which in
turn corrected the military industrial complex in 1980.

Attempts like that of Russian President Vladimir Putin to establish
long-prepared for autarky in 2022 are the counterforce to 2001 when the
imperative of global trade forced governments to dismantle national
bureaucracy, which in turn corrected the heavy promotion of industrial
champions in 1980. And the "proxy wars" of 2022 in Libya or Yemen are
the counter-reaction to 2001 with US-led regime change in "failed
states," which in turn corrected the attempts by Washington and Moscow
at creating puppet regimes in Nicaragua and Afghanistan.

Europeans Read It Differently

If the constitutive forces of our---regressive---new world order are
becoming clear, so too are the counterforces. And [the
**E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [is seen as **prime**
amongst these counterforces: a potential force for **integration** and
**openness**]{.underline}. The people I spoke with were all enthusiastic
about the EU's efforts to achieve "European sovereignty" and looked upon
the EU as [a **vital ally**]{.underline} in [pushing the pendulum back
again]{.underline}.

And so, it was worrying that, even though Europeans used the same terms
as the rest of the world, our interpretation of these four forces in
fact turned out to be very different as I drilled down.

Sino-American bipolarity: All agreed that Sino-US relations define the
ruptures in the global order. But Europeans these days speak more and
more of an implacable ideological rivalry between China and the US, the
emergence of two competing economic systems, and the need to line up
behind Washington in pursuit of liberal values. By contrast, the rest of
the world saw two big powers interested primarily in top dog status, in
a hurry because of domestic weaknesses, and too vulnerable to really
compete. They spoke of "implosion or collusion"---the pair would
overheat if they competed and, therefore, were more likely to sew up
global affairs quietly between them. And whilst Beijing and Washington
might set ideological loyalty tests for partners, they wouldn't be able
to enforce them, let alone show loyalty in return. They hoped that the
[EU would promote **liberal norms**]{.underline} on their own merit,
rather than using these as an excuse to take sides and line up behind
the US.

Geo-economics. All agreed that the state is making a return to the
global economy, not least because of China's command economy model. But
Europeans talked of responding by becoming geo-economic, learning to
leverage the EU's huge internal market for the purposes of spreading its
rules. By contrast, in the perception of the rest of the world the EU,
like the US, has been actively geo-economic for decades, using their
structural influence in global standard-setting bodies, their
multinational businesses, and above all their internal markets to open
up the global economy. They suggested that the EU tends to view itself
as the passive victim of the backlash and worried that the EU would now
further isolate itself, putting up market barriers first and then
leveraging access to its market to spread its rules. This was a real
dilemma for them. They liked the flavor of EU norms, but did not see why
these should be imposed unilaterally from Brussels.

Sovereignization. All agreed that Russia is in the vanguard when it
comes to preferring state-building to wealth. But Europeans saw Russia
as a limitless malcontent, an indiscriminate and risk-hungry spoiler
weaponizing cross-border economic and infrastructural links to simply
cut itself off. By contrast, the rest of the world described Russia as
having skin in the game, a constitutive power that was trying to win
over its peers and prove that its model of
state-building-without-interdependence could work. They spoke of a
strange alliance between a neo-imperial Russia and former European
colonies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, with Putin bent on proving
that 1950s-style state-building still worked. They argued that the only
way to defeat Russia was on normative terms, showing that its "strong
state model" is anything but---that it creates chaos and is dependent on
China and that the EU's open model is still viable and attractive.

[Conflict **black holes**]{.underline}. All sides worried about conflict
zones as [providing the **dark matter** of the **new
order**]{.underline}. Europeans complained about being ringed by such
[conflicts]{.underline}, which they could not enter and [could **not
contain**---**Libya**, **Syria**, **Yemen**, **Nagorno-Karabakh**,
**Donbass**, **Transnistria**]{.underline}. They pictured the EU
surrounded by [a **"ring of fire,"** that]{.underline} was
**[suck]{.underline}**ing [**in** the **great powers**]{.underline}. The
rest of the world pointed out, firstly, that these conflict hotspots
were far more widespread than merely marking the EU's neighborhood. And
secondly, that they were not vacuums. These were spaces where the [great
powers test new military **tech**]{.underline}nologies, cut access to
the Internet, and spawn new global norms cynically citing humanitarian
imperatives and establishing exceptions from international law.
[These]{.underline} black holes [will constitute a **new global
order**]{.underline} much more than they contain the old. Again, this is
a field where [the]{.underline} rest of the [world expected the EU to
**lead** a **multilateral response**]{.underline}.

In this scenario, [European states would continue to assume]{.underline}
that [Washington's security guarantees remain valid]{.underline} in most
circumstances. Abandoning extended nuclear deterrence would be seen as
running counter to the core interests of the Trump administration. For
its part, Washington has long viewed extended deterrence as an important
instrument for reducing the risk of nuclear war, preventing hostile
power projection in strategically important regions and ensuring the
stability needed to main­tain political and economic relations at the
global level. This view appears to remain intact under the second Trump
administration. Moreover, countering the rise of China continues to be a
key strategic priority of the US government. If Trump were to abandon
extended deterrence, Europe's willingness to support US efforts to
contain the People's Republic would likely wane -- a development that
would not go down well in Washington.

But even in this scenario, [European governments would be acutely aware
that a growing gap in the credibility of Washington's security
guarantees could have **serious**]{.underline} medium- and long-term
**[consequences]{.underline}**. The [perceived erosion of trust
would]{.underline} put [pressure]{.underline} on [European leaders to
demonstrate unity vis-à-vis Moscow, to provide reassurance]{.underline}
to their own population [through political measures and]{.underline} to
[pressure Washington to restore confidence]{.underline}. In this case,
there are feasible steps that could be taken in several areas while
leaving current policy more or less intact. And for both Europe and the
US, the political, financial and military costs would be moderate.

Political steps. [In response to France's]{.underline} recent [proposal
that its nuclear arsenal play a bigger role]{.underline} in European
deterrence, [Germany and other European states could
initiate]{.underline} bilateral, minilateral or multilateral
[consultations]{.underline}, including high-profile meetings intended
[to send a political signal. This could lead to **political
commitments**]{.underline} such as in­creased investment in research and
education [in]{.underline} the area of [nuclear deterrence, greater
emphasis on deterrence]{.underline} in the national security strategies
of non-nuclear allies [and]{.underline} a [strengthening]{.underline} of
[the role that France plays in]{.underline} bilateral, European and
[global nuclear forums]{.underline}.

For its part, **[France could declare]{.underline}** that **[the
security of all its European neighbours falls within its vital national
interests]{.underline}**. At the same time, Paris might consider seeking
at least observer status in NATO's Nuclear Planning Group. It could also
propose initi­ating a dialogue with London and Washington on the closer
coordination of nuclear operations.

Military steps. At the same time, [Germany and other European states
could take modest but visible military steps]{.underline} -- aimed,
above all, at sending a political signal but [providing limited added
deterrent value. Such steps could include participation in French
nuclear exercises and]{.underline} the [provision of conventional
capabilities]{.underline} designed [to complement France's nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}, thereby strengthening France's resilience in a
crisis through enhanced operational redundancy. Germany and other
countries could upgrade their air bases to allow for the stationing of
French fighter aircraft, potentially even when nuclear-armed; this would
increase France's deployment options and improve the survivability of
its air-based nuclear forces. Furthermore, European allies could take
measures to be ready to offer support to France's nuclear air and sea
forces during a crisis -- in the areas of logistics, intelligence
sharing, and surveillance and reconnaissance.

#### Lack of U.S. commitment spurs French nuclear sharing.

Two weeks after Russia\'s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, French
President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} descended 20 stories beneath
Paris to send a message to Moscow.

He entered France\'s nuclear bunker deep under his regal presidential
palace to lead an exercise dubbed Poker. Officials had chosen that
night, in March 2022, for its clear skies. They [wanted to respond
to]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}, who days
earlier had made a thinly veiled threat to the West by putting his
country\'s nuclear forces on high alert.

Commanders waited for a Russian spy satellite to pass over their distant
airfield and launched drills they were confident the Kremlin would
watch, according to French officials. Rafale fighter jets took off
carrying dummy weapons to simulate attacks on an unnamed country \--
part of a high-stakes pantomime that strategists call nuclear signaling.

France is unusual in its ability to send such signals. Of the world\'s
eight declared nuclear powers, France and Britain are the only ones in
Europe. The biggest nuclear power in the region is the U.S. \-- North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Turkey host American nuclear weapons on bases within their
borders.

Now [U.S. protection is looking increasingly shaky after]{.underline}
President [Trump\'s diplomatic opening to Russia, temporary halt of aid
to Ukraine and antagonism toward Europe. That\'s led to **growing calls
for a European nuclear umbrella** tapping the arsenals of France and
Britain, independent of the U.S.]{.underline}

\"Sharing nuclear weapons is an issue that we need to talk about,\"
German Chancellor-designate Friedrich Merz said recently, referring to
other European countries. Merz and Macron have met at least three times
since Merz won elections in November, though neither side has said if
they discussed nuclear weapons.

[Creating a European nuclear capability would upend decades-old systems
and procedures established by the U.S. within NATO]{.underline} during
the Cold War. It would be expensive and technically demanding, take
years to fully implement and require a delicate navigation of
nuclear-arms treaties already battered by upstart powers including North
Korea and Iran.

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [shows no sign of wanting to
relinquish its dominance of Europe\'s nuclear posture]{.underline}.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at NATO headquarters earlier this
year that Europe must \"take ownership of conventional security on the
continent\" \-- with \"conventional security\" meaning nonnuclear arms.

As Hegseth visited Brussels, two U.S. B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers
\-- America\'s most iconic hydrogen-bomb carrier \-- arrived at a
British airfield to conduct training runs with allied fighter jets as
far away as Turkey.

\"It\'s nice to see B-52s flying over Stockholm, but that alone isn\'t
nuclear deterrence,\" said Minna Alander, an associate fellow at British
think tank Chatham House. \"[**Deterrence** **depends on the political
commitment of the U.S. president**]{.underline},\" said Alander, a Finn
who lives in Stockholm and noted an upsurge in talk of nuclear
deterrence and even the concept of a Nordic atomic bomb.

At a recent meeting at NATO headquarters, Polish President Andrzej [Duda
said that]{.underline} \"[any nuclear umbrella will benefit Polish
security]{.underline}.\" [Cooperating with]{.underline} NATO ally
[France]{.underline} on the issues [is]{.underline} \"[absolutely
obvious and natural]{.underline},\" [he said. Danish Prime
Minister]{.underline} Mette [Frederiksen]{.underline} also [refused to
exclude European nuclear-arms cooperation when asked about it by
reporters]{.underline}.

Germany since the 1950s has allowed the U.S. to base nuclear weapons on
its territory and German officials have said they want to maintain that
protection as long as possible, even if similar arrangements were made
with France or the U.K.

The American nuclear arms in Europe remain under U.S. control and are
carried on U.S. planes by U.S. crews under U.S. command, though they
could be provided to non-nuclear allies for use during time of war under
NATO oversight.

[For Macron and his compatriots, who have long urged Europe to develop
security options independent of the U.S., **the shift comes as a
vindication** after years of scorn]{.underline}.

\"[**Until now**, French proposals were met with little response, except
for the occasional amused sigh]{.underline} that said: There go those
French again, feeling indispensable,\" said Jean-Louis Lozier, a former
French Navy officer who commanded two ballistic missile submarines and
headed the army\'s nuclear forces division.

Swapping nuclear protector states wouldn\'t be easy, even within NATO.
[Britain can launch nuclear weapons only from submarines. French nuclear
arms would need extensive redesigning]{.underline} to be launched from
non-French planes or subs, say specialists \-- if France were to even
allow such an arrangement.

To stay compliant with international agreements including the 1970
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons \-- through which 191
countries have pledged to prevent the spread of nuclear arms \--
[command and control over French or British nukes would need to remain
with Paris or London, **even on allies\' territory**]{.underline}. It
was one thing for Europeans to accept Washington\'s nuclear control
during the Cold War, but [ceding a degree of sovereignty to a
neighboring European peer today could prove politically
fraught]{.underline}.

And all [those complexities presume France and Britain have nuclear
weapons to spare]{.underline} \-- **[which they don\'t]{.underline}**.

Britain relies solely on four submarines to carry its nuclear warheads.
It has the smallest nuclear arsenal of the major nuclear nations, with
around 250 warheads. The British government says its aim is to maintain
\"a minimum, credible, independent nuclear deterrent.\" Yet London
struggles to manage its nuclear force.

Britain\'s top military brass last year gathered on a submarine to watch
a nuclear-missile test-firing. The Trident was supposed to soar several
thousand miles into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, it
splashed straight into the sea.

In the test before that, in 2016, an unarmed missile launched off the
coast of Florida and programmed to fly toward Africa instead headed
toward the U.S., veering so dangerously off course that commanders
triggered its self-destruct mechanism.

A close alliance with the U.S. has allowed Britain to run its nuclear
deterrent as cheaply as possible. Britain leases from the U.S. the
ballistic missiles that carry its nuclear warheads. Those Trident
missiles are test-fired from British submarines near Cape Canaveral
under American supervision and are serviced at a base in Georgia. Many
of the components inside U.K. nuclear submarines carrying its bombs are
bought off the shelf from U.S. vendors. The U.S. shares nuclear
targeting information with the U.K. for all of Russia.

London is now pursuing a costly and delayed upgrade whose price tag
risks weakening the rest of its military. It is replacing its
Vanguard-class submarines, which date to the 1990s, and upgrading its
nuclear warheads, for which it has allocated around GBP 100 billion
(about \$129 billion) between 2023 and 2033. Costs have increased
sharply in recent years and politicians now must choose between nuclear
and conventional forces.

The debate cuts to the essence of why countries have nuclear weapons.

Washington and Moscow in the 1950s stumbled into the Cold War nuclear
arms race as each developed weapons that one-upped the other in range,
accuracy and number. Both explored options to use nuclear weapons at the
outset of a war \-- particularly in the U.S.\'s case to compensate for
the perceived Soviet-bloc advantage in conventional forces \-- and as
retribution for an attack. Building systems that could deliver a second
strike demanded increasingly resilient and undetectable platforms
including rockets, submarines and stealth aircraft.

[European countries don\'t want first-strike capabilities. What they
seek]{.underline} from nuclear weapons [is]{.underline} the [deterrence
that comes from the Kremlin knowing that Europeans could inflict
horrific damage if Russia launched a nuclear first-strike]{.underline}.
When France developed its nuclear weapons in the 1950s \-- in defiance
of the U.S. \-- President Charles de Gaulle was quoted as saying the
bombs only needed to \"tear the arm off the Russian bear,\" not destroy
it.

[France has continued to invest billions]{.underline} of dollars
annually [to maintain a nuclear arsenal estimated at 290 warheads,
operated independently of the U.S.]{.underline} France produces all
necessary components domestically.

As with the British, only a portion of the French sea-based nuclear
force is deployed at any given time as the rest of the submarine fleet
undergoes maintenance or training.

France reminds Russia of its power by conducting its Poker nuclear
exercises every few months, dispatching Rafale jets with dummy hydrogen
bombs strapped under their wings.

Britain, though, can\'t engage in nuclear signaling like France because
each time one of its submarines surfaces, its location is disclosed,
making it a potential target.

Unlike the vast nuclear arsenals that Washington and Moscow developed,
those in France and Britain were supplemental to America\'s nuclear
umbrella over Europe.

\"[The U.K. and France nuclear strategy was always predicated on a U.S.
nuclear backstop]{.underline},\" said Pranay Vaddi, who served as the
top nuclear expert on former President Joe Biden\'s National Security
Council. \"They\'ve built forces with the assumption that the U.S.
strategic arsenal is committed to their defense as well, and U.S.
conventional and nuclear forces in Europe would be engaged in defense of
NATO from Russian attack.\"

Some former Pentagon officials say that the French and British nuclear
arsenals would need to undergo an extensive multibillion-dollar upgrade
if the Europeans\' goal was to match the flexibility of the U.S. nuclear
arsenal. A particular concern, they say, is that the British and French
nuclear forces currently have few, if any, low-yield weapons that could
be used to deter or respond to a small Russian nuclear attack in the
hope of avoiding further escalation.

Other experts say that [their current forces may suffice, especially if
France and Britain make explicit that they\'re being committed to
NATO\'s defense]{.underline}.

\"**[A couple of hundred nuclear weapons is a greater destructive force
than the planet has ever seen]{.underline}**,\" said Jon Wolfsthal of
the Federation of American Scientists, who served as a senior official
on former President Barack Obama\'s National Security Council.

[Whether the U.S. would launch nuclear weapons in response to a Russian
nuclear strike]{.underline} on Europe [has **always been an
unknown**]{.underline}, because it could prompt Moscow to strike
America, said James Davis, chair of international relations at the
University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.

Would the U.S. risk sacrificing New York as revenge for the nuking of
London or Paris? Perhaps not, Europeans have quietly worried.

[With European nuclear sharing, the question becomes: Would France
sacrifice Paris as revenge for a Russian strike on Prague]{.underline}?
\"[In a way **it\'s easier for the Europeans**]{.underline},\" said
Davis, [because a nuclear strike on a European target could irradiate
much of the continent]{.underline}.

What a purely European nuclear deterrent might look like is only now
coming under discussion. Whether the U.S. would accept it is uncertain.
Discussions won\'t move quickly.

French Senator Cedric Perrin, who heads the chamber\'s foreign and
defense committee, said European countries could help pay for France\'s
nuclear force, which last year cost roughly \$6.6 billion in upkeep.

French nuclear protection, Perrin said, \"comes at a cost.\"

#### It's feasible.

**Economist 25**, "Eurobombs," The Economist, Vol. 454, No. 9439,
03-15-2025, accessed 07-16-2025, ProQuest, DG

"WE WOULD BE safer if we had our own nuclear arsenal," Donald Tusk,
Poland's prime minister, told his country's parliament on March 7th. The
reason he gave was the "profound change of American geopolitics", a
euphemism for Donald Trump's diplomatic arson, which also required
Poland to expand its conventional armed forces.

Mr Tusk was not proposing a Polish nuclear bomb---at least not
immediately: "The road to that would be very long and there would have
to be a consensus." Instead, he was responding to a call by Friedrich
Merz, Germany's incoming chancellor, for talks with Britain and France
on "[supplementing the American nuclear shield]{.underline}". On March
5th Emmanuel Macron, France's president, announced a "strategic debate
on using our deterrence to protect our allies on the European
continent".

That debate [will need to confront]{.underline} two problems:
[**credibility** and **capability**]{.underline}. For nearly 80 years
America has held a nuclear umbrella over Europe. Yet extended deterrence
is a strange and unnatural thing. One country must promise to use its
nuclear forces---and thereby risk nuclear annihilation---on behalf of
another. The difficulty of making that promise credible is what drove
America to build a huge arsenal and to scatter it across the world.
[Britain's nuclear forces]{.underline}, though modest, [are]{.underline}
also "[assigned]{.underline}" [to the defence of NATO]{.underline}.
Though only the prime minister can authorise their use, the implicit
promise is that they would be used to defend allies such as Finland,
Romania or Turkey.

[France has a more complicated relationship]{.underline} to extended
deterrence. [It pursued an independent nuclear deterrent]{.underline} in
the 1950s precisely [because it believed]{.underline}, to a greater
extent than Britain, that [America's umbrella was not
dependable]{.underline}. France did not join and still does not take
part in the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), a NATO forum in which 31
allies discuss nuclear policy. "[The idea is really to **keep options
open** for the president]{.underline}," explains Emmanuelle Maitre of
the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. "There is a kind of
reluctance to commit...to anything that could limit \[his\] freedom of
action."

Yet [France's leaders have also said its vital interests have
a]{.underline} "[European dimension]{.underline}". In 1995 [Britain and
France agreed]{.underline} that "[the vital interests of one could not
be threatened without the]{.underline} vital interests of the [other
equally being at risk]{.underline}"---an implicit expansion of the
horizon of French deterrence. The same language was used in the
Franco-German Aachen treaty 24 years later. Even Jordan Bardella, the
leader of the far-right National Rally party, recently acknowledged that
French nuclear weapons "protect, by definition, certain neighbours and
certain European partners".

The question is what this means in practice. In 2022 Mr Macron said he
would "evidently" not respond in kind if Russia used nuclear weapons in
Ukraine. French vital interests were "clearly defined", he claimed,
confusingly, and "these would not be at stake if there was a nuclear
ballistic attack in Ukraine"---or, he added, unwisely, "in the region".
That phrase seemed to exclude eastern European EU and NATO allies from
protection. Since then Mr [Macron has taken a **hawkish
turn**]{.underline}, successfully [rebuilding ties to eastern European
states]{.underline}. But [even France's closest allies have private
doubts as to whether]{.underline} successive [presidents in the future
will be willing to risk nuclear war to support them]{.underline}.

[European allies are]{.underline} now [asking how far]{.underline} Mr
[Macron might]{.underline} be prepared to [go]{.underline}. "I would
like to know, first of all, in detail what it means in terms of power to
use these weapons," Mr Tusk told journalists, seeming to hint at a model
in which Poland would be vested with some launch authority. "If we were
to decide on this, it would be worth making sure it is in our hands and
we make the ultimate decisions."

La bombe, c'est la mienne

That carries echoes of the proposed Multilateral Force, a 1950s concept
for a jointly owned and operated pan-European nuclear force. The idea
was that 25 ships would each carry eight Polaris missiles, with the crew
of each one drawn from at least three NATO countries. Later, in the
1960s, Britain proposed an Atlantic Nuclear Force that would put British
and American nuclear forces under international command, with national
vetoes.

Those plans largely fizzled and are unlikely to find favour today. Mr
[Macron appears to have ruled out any movement towards joint launch
authority]{.underline}. France's nuclear deterrent is "sovereign and
French from start to finish", he insisted. The decision to use nuclear
weapons "has always been, and will always be, up to the president and
commander-in-chief of France". There are legal obstacles, too. If
Britain or France were to transfer custody and control of their own
nuclear weapons, or if non-nuclear states were to build new ones, they
would have to leave the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty---or violate
it.

There are other options, though. Peter Watkins, a former British defence
official who oversaw nuclear policy, proposes that [France could **join
NATO's NPG as an observer** rather than participant. A punchier option
would be for France to **publicly clarify** the European dimension of
its interests]{.underline}. Bruno Tertrais, a French nuclear expert, has
suggested that [France could]{.underline} simply [make it clear that
Article 42.7 of the Lisbon treaty]{.underline}, the EU's mutual-defence
clause, "[could be exercised by any means]{.underline}, thus [including
nuclear weapons]{.underline}".

[Another course would be to borrow from America's approach to extended
deterrence]{.underline}. The United States has long stationed 180 or so
B61 tactical nuclear bombs in Europe. They remain under American
control. But the air forces of Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands and Turkey practise carrying and delivering them using
dual-capable aircraft. Other air forces contribute conventionally armed
aircraft to support those missions, performing tasks such as jamming
enemy radars and refuelling (see map).

Britain would find it tricky to mimic those nuclear-sharing
arrangements. Since the 1990s all its nukes have been on submarines
whose whereabouts remain secret. Subs can be used for signalling---in
early 2022, soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, France took the
unusual step of putting three of its four nuclear-armed boats to
sea---but you cannot sail one up the Rhine or Vistula to reassure
allies.

Planes are a different matter. [France possesses air-launched nuclear
weapons to send a]{.underline} "[final warning]{.underline}" [to an
enemy]{.underline}, before it fires submarine-launched missiles at,
presumably, Russian cities. In its Poker exercise, [the French air force
practises long-range nuclear bombing raids four times a
year]{.underline}. In 2020, after the shock of Mr Trump's first term, Mr
[Macron invited allies to]{.underline} "[associate]{.underline}" [with
French nuclear drills]{.underline}. Voilà, in 2022 an Italian tanker
refuelled French aircraft in one such exercise. In recent days, other
allies have offered to take part, says a person familiar with those
talks.

The question is how much further this might go. [**French
nuclear-capable aircraft increasingly take part in conventional
exercises** abroad]{.underline}, including with Lithuania and Germany
last year. In 2018 Mr Tertrais suggested that **[France could eventually
rotate unarmed nuclear-capable Rafale fighter bombers to eastern
European air bases]{.underline}** "**[to demonstrate its
solidarity]{.underline}**". [That would not be just a political signal.
It would]{.underline} also [extend the range at which France could
strike Russia and safely return its aircraft]{.underline}. In more
extreme scenarios, Mr Tertrais writes, France could base tens of
air-launched missiles in Germany, allow these to be carried by allied
jets or even convene "a European nuclear maritime task-force".

The problem with all this is scale. America's arsenal is large enough,
notes Mr Watkins, "that it is plausible that it could employ some
weapons in response to \[an\] attack on an ally while still having
plenty in reserve...to deter an attack on the US homeland." In Britain's
case, he adds, using a single missile at lower levels of
escalation---say, in response to Russia's use of a tactical nuclear
weapon---"could compromise the location of the sole deployed submarine".
These [**problems are hardly insurmountable**. Britain raised its cap on
warheads]{.underline} in 2021 [and could do so again]{.underline}.
Moreover, [if it built five]{.underline} rather than four
[Dreadnought-class submarines]{.underline}, the first of which is
expected in the early 2030s, [it could put two boats out to sea at
once]{.underline}.

Assuming, that is, [it could build more. The very threat which
necessitates these schemes]{.underline}---Mr Trump's hostile attitude
towards allies---[might]{.underline} also [complicate the
response]{.underline}. Britain depends intimately on America for the
design, manufacture and maintenance of nuclear weapons. The Trident
missiles that carry them are leased and held in America. Their British
warheads must fit inside an American "aeroshell". And the tubes which
hold the missiles in the Dreadnought class are the same as those in
America's Columbia-class subs.

A new entente cordiale

In the worst-case (which few officials think is likely), if America were
to cut off support, Britain could hang on to the missiles in its
possession, probably for some years. But its future warhead and
submarine plans would no longer be viable. [One option for Britain would
be to revive the idea of co-operation with France]{.underline}. In the
1970s France proposed selling submarine-launched missiles to Britain
and, in the 1980s, suggested co-developing a nuclear-capable cruise
missile.

[That would be a **dramatic step**]{.underline}. Mr
[Macron's]{.underline} "[strategic debate]{.underline}" [is at an
**early stage**]{.underline}. For now, says Héloïse Fayet of the IFRI
think-tank in Paris, "there are no talks about putting French nuclear
weapons outside French territory", let alone diluting French authority
to use them. "[The idea is more to advance on the political
side]{.underline}," says Ms Fayet, "[trying to find, at a very high
level, shared vital interests]{.underline} between, for example, France
and Sweden, or France and Germany", [as well as expanding allied
involvement in French nuclear exercises]{.underline}. "[There are plenty
of ideas]{.underline}, but we are **[lacking French political
guidance]{.underline}**." That might disappoint the likes of Mr Tusk,
who see a crisis brewing. Even so, Mr [Trump has sparked Europe's **most
profound nuclear debate since the 1950s**]{.underline}.

### Nuclear Sharing\-\--Internal\-\--AT: No Sharing\-\--2NC

#### Both sides say yes. 

Joseph **de Weck 25**, Senior Fellow at Institut Montaigne, Europe
Director at Greenmantle, M.A. from Sciences Po Paris, "Europeanizing
France's force de frappe," Internationale Politik Quarterly, 02-13-2025,
accessed 07-18-2025,
https://ip-quarterly.com/en/europeanizing-frances-force-de-frappe, DG

In one of his last interviews before his death, former German finance
minister and doyen of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU)
Wolfgang Schäuble made a bold proposal: In return for helping Paris
finance its nuclear deterrent, also known as force de frappe, [Germany
should be able to slide under the French nuclear umbrella]{.underline}.

It's an old idea that never got traction. Roughly 50 years ago,
Franz-Josef Strauß, a legendary Bavarian prime minister and conservative
figurehead, made a similar proposal. But Bonn hesitated, and Paris
wasn't really interested.

After all, President Charles de Gaulle decided to build the bomb at
great cost in the late 1950s not only because he feared the Soviet
Union. It was also the ultimate guarantee that Germany would never
invade France again. Furthermore, de Gaulle saw it as a means of
retaining some great power status at a time when the French republic was
in the process of losing its colonies in Asia and Africa. Why share that
trump card with Bonn?

Time has passed. In France, few fear a German invasion anymore. And yes,
for France the nuclear bomb is still a source of pride and ensures its
recognition among nuclear powers.

But [given Russia's neo-imperialism]{.underline}; US President Donald
[Trump not ruling out the use of military force to conquer]{.underline}
European Union territory in [Greenland]{.underline}, which is owned by
member state Denmark; [and France's empty state coffers, could Paris now
be ready]{.underline} to seriously explore options of Europeanizing
France's nuclear force? Two points.

**[Paris Wants a Dialogue]{.underline}**

First, [the force de frappe hasn't been]{.underline} an [exclusively
French]{.underline} affair [for a while. Successive]{.underline} French
[presidents from]{.underline} François [Mitterrand onwards have
underlined that France's vital interests protected by the nuclear
deterrent **also comprise a European dimension**]{.underline}. What this
means exactly is unclear. Former President François Hollande said in
2015, "Who could believe an aggression endangering the survival of
Europe would have no consequences?" We are in the realm of constructive
ambiguity here.

Second, President Emmanuel [Macron is **willing to kick start a debate**
to flesh out more concretely what this]{.underline} "[European
dimension]{.underline}" [of France's force de frappe
entails]{.underline}. In a speech in February 2020 at the École de
Guerre, France's military academy, [Macron said]{.underline} that [he
was willing to discuss with other EU member states the role that
France's nuclear deterrent can play in their collective
security]{.underline}. Macron repeated that proposal in 2024.

German Chancellors Angela [Merkel and]{.underline} Olaf [Scholz never
responded to Macron's offer. With]{.underline} Friedrich
[Merz]{.underline}, who is likely to become Germany's next chancellor,
**[there is]{.underline}** perhaps **[a new chance]{.underline}**. Last
year, the former Schäuble confidante argued that Berlin must take up
Macron's proposal of a strategic dialogue on nuclear protection. "A lot
needs to be discussed without a pre-conceived result in mind. What is
France ready to share? What do they expect from us? And what would the
decision-making process look like?" Germany's likely next chancellor
asked.

Time for Questions

Macron's proposal to enter into a dialogue on the force de frappe should
not be seen as an offer to build an independent nuclear deterrent within
the framework of the EU, French officials say. [Any arrangement, whereby
Paris would transfer sovereignty]{.underline} over the use of its own
nuclear bombs to an EU institution or some other state [is a no
go]{.underline} in terms of domestic politics. Instead, [Macron is
willing to discuss how **France itself can offer some kind of extended
deterrence guarantee to Europe in the event of US
withdrawal**]{.underline}.

[Even this]{.underline} kind of more limited option [raises an
**avalanche** of technical, legal, strategic, and political
questions]{.underline}. For instance, would France need to build up its
arsenal so Paris could offer a credible deterrence guarantee that
reaches beyond the Rhine? France currently has 290 warheads, which is no
comparison to America's 5,550 or Russia's 6,257.

Or where exactly would France's updated nuclear doctrine draw its red
lines and specify under which circumstances Paris would retaliate and
"go nuclear" to defend a European ally? And would Germany be fine with
co-financing a French nuclear weapons stock if it only had a limited say
over its use when push comes to shove?

These questions are just scratching the surface. [French expert circles
advise that Paris and other European capitals should engage in a careful
step-by-step approach]{.underline} if the force de frappe is supposed to
complement and, in a worst-case scenario, replace the US guarantee. [But
Europeans **may simply not have the time for gradualism** in security
integration anymore]{.underline}. French writer Victor Hugo once said,
"**[Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come." Now may
be the time]{.underline}**.

#### France would take the lead.

France's]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal is **essential**]{.underline} for
two reasons. First, President Emmanuel [Macron has **long advocated for
European autonomy** and a **stronger European role in France's nuclear
strategy**, aligning with the country's historical push for European
independence]{.underline}. In contrast, the United Kingdom maintains
closer ties to the United States. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken
a softer stance toward the Trump administration and refrained from
following European counter-tariff policies. Structurally, Britain's
membership in the Five Eyes intelligence network and its 2016 vote to
leave the European Union has made it the most U.S.-dependent state in
Europe; these decisions raise doubts about its willingness to pivot
toward a new security strategy. Most importantly, the United Kingdom
depends on the United States for its nuclear arsenal, leasing submarine
missiles and basing its warheads on U.S. designs. There are even
indications of potential renewed U.S. nuclear deployments to British
soil, as occurred during the Cold War.

Second, the United Kingdom's nuclear arsenal is more limited than
France's. While their overall stockpiles are similar, only about half of
the U.K.'s arsenal is available for immediate use. The United Kingdom
relies exclusively on four Vanguard-class submarines armed with
ballistic missiles, with only one at sea at any point in time.
Maintaining even this minimal presence has proven challenging, making
the British deterrent a last-resort case. Once its submarine launches a
missile, it becomes vulnerable, leaving the United Kingdom without
further nuclear options. This limits its capability beyond defending a
state-ending attack. Additionally, failed missile tests have raised
further doubts about the reliability of the U.K.'s arsenal.

This does not mean that there is no role for [the **U**nited
**K**ingdom]{.underline} in a future European nuclear umbrella. As a
member of the Nuclear Planning Group, it [has experience consulting with
allies on nuclear matters and could help design a European
mechanism]{.underline}. Although [the United Kingdom's small and
inflexible arsenal]{.underline} makes its use beyond national survival
unlikely, it [can still play a role in deterrence as a high-impact,
low-probability factor]{.underline}. In fact, NATO has long maintained
that French and British nuclear forces complement U.S. capabilities by
"complicating the calculations of potential adversaries." The United
Kingdom could serve a similar role in complementing a French umbrella. A
more ambitious approach would involve deeper Franco-British nuclear
cooperation, especially if the United Kingdom moves toward a more
independent arsenal. However, such a shift can only be a long-term
prospect.

What is the Alternative?

Taken together, [concerns over the credibility of a French nuclear
umbrella seem **overstated**]{.underline}, as many of the same issues
apply to the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The U.S. president retains sole
authority over nuclear use, despite NATO's consultation mechanisms.
Moreover, the United States is less dependent on the E.U. economy and,
more importantly, is geographically distant from Europe. Thus, [the fact
that France has a greater stake in European security might
offset]{.underline} some of [the challenges posed by the relatively
small size of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. However, arsenal size
and flexibility remain pressing concerns. Solving these challenges will
require a combination of creative policymaking --- such as co-financing
or cross-financing the French deterrent by European allies --- and
concrete efforts to strengthen and modernize the arsenal.

There is an additional concern: Given current U.S. diplomatic
approaches, what are the alternatives? Credibility critically hinges on
the perception that the security guarantor is committed to defending its
allies. Which E.U. member states trust that Trump would meaningfully
consult with allies and consider their input before deciding on nuclear
use? The current U.S. administration's threats to annex some allies and
its forceful approach toward others cast doubt on the credibility of
U.S. security guarantees. Under these circumstances, [it could be more
reasonable to rely on France for protection]{.underline}. It is of
course possible that U.S. policy will return to a more collaborative
approach toward allies in Europe in four years. Yet, Europeans would be
foolish to bet their security on wishful thinking.

In the meantime, Polish Prime Minister [Tusk has hinted at the
possibility of a Polish nuclear weapon. In Germany, a recent
op-ed]{.underline} in a prominent newspaper [openly called for an
explicit nuclear hedging strategy]{.underline} to ensure a pathway to
the bomb in a worst case scenario. If such ideas were to translate into
actual policy, they would alter the European security landscape and
disrupt the international nonproliferation order far more dramatically
than an extended French nuclear umbrella. However[, a strengthened
French deterrent could directly address the very concerns that fuel such
increasingly radical proposals]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} first [concern]{.underline} is [that France would
never hand nuclear decision-making power]{.underline} to its allies.
Particularly, the French president would always retain sole authority
over nuclear use. This [is certainly true]{.underline}. Yet, [**the same
applies in the current NATO model**, where the U.S. president
retains]{.underline} the [sole authorit]{.underline}y to use U.S.
nuclear weapons. While NATO-sanctioned nuclear use requires the approval
of the Nuclear Planning Group, the actual implications of this process
remain ambiguous. For instance, it seems implausible that, in the event
of a crisis, deliberations within NATO would dictate U.S. decisions on
nuclear use. This is even less plausible when considering scenarios in
which allies seek to push the United States toward nuclear use rather
than restrain it. In fact, NATO's history suggests that allies have
often been skeptical of U.S. commitments to meaningfully consult with
them. Even after the adoption of the Athens Guidelines in 1962 --- which
specified that the United States would consult allies on nuclear use "if
time permits" --- key allies such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and
Germany sought separate bilateral agreements with Washington to ensure
their voices were heard.

As important, [whatever consultative mechanisms exist, they are
**ultimately non-binding**]{.underline}. The U.S. president retains sole
authority over the use of America's nuclear weapons. Furthermore, [only
a portion of U.S. nuclear weapons are assigned to NATO]{.underline},
meaning that [only these could be subject to any]{.underline} form of
[shared decision-making]{.underline} in the first place. Another factor
is the stationing of nuclear weapons on allied territory. However, these
make up only about five percent of America's nuclear arsenal. Host
states might have a de facto veto power, given that nuclear deployment
would require allied military personnel and fighter jets. At the same
time, since the introduction of Permissive Action Links in the 1960s, no
decision to use U.S.-owned nuclear weapons can be made without explicit
U.S. authorization.

[France **would not need to give up its ultimate nuclear authority** if
France wanted to extend a nuclear umbrella over E.U. member states and
European NATO allies interested]{.underline} in such an offer. [A
consultation body could take shape]{.underline} --- one [that includes
**info**rmation-sharing, involvement in military planning, and
potentially deliberation about nuclear use]{.underline} --- [**giving
allies a voice** without granting them formal decision-making power. One
possibility would be for France to join NATO's existing Nuclear Planning
Group]{.underline}, though it has long resisted doing so.
[Another]{.underline} option [is]{.underline} the creation of [an
entirely new European body outside of NATO]{.underline}. Paris might be
more receptive to the latter idea as it aligns with France's long-held
aspiration for strategic autonomy from U.S.-dominated military
structures.

#### It is politically feasible.

More than 50 years ago, in the 1974 Ottawa Declaration, [NATO
emphasized]{.underline} the contribution of [France and Great
Britain]{.underline} to the Alliance\'s common deterrence. Today, 50
years later, it would be entirely appropriate to further strengthen the
European components of the deterrence alliance --- not as a replacement,
but as a supplement to the existing NATO mechanism. [Macron]{.underline}
has **[repeatedly pointed out]{.underline}** that [the French nuclear
strategy already has a European component]{.underline}.

Therefore, there is every reason, absolutely every reason, for Germany
and other partners to take up the French offer of entering talks on
future joint options. The argument that such a step would risk angering
Washington is a specious one: Of course, one can explain to the American
partner in advance that such considerations are intended to further
strengthen European defense capabilities, as expressis verbis requested
by Washington.

[The]{.underline} second [argument]{.underline} --- [Paris would not be
willing to share the decision-making authority]{.underline} to use
French nuclear potential --- [is]{.underline} just as [**unreasonable**.
For 70 years, we have unquestioningly accepted]{.underline} that [the
American president has sole decision-making authority over]{.underline}
the use of all [US nuclear weapons]{.underline}, including those
stationed in Germany with "dual key". Now, the American president is a
9-hour flight away from Berlin, while [the French president is **only 2
hours away**. It is]{.underline} therefore r[easonable to
assume]{.underline} that [a nuclear threat to its eastern neighbors
would **affect France\'s interests even more immediately than those of
the U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the credibility of
any nuclear deterrence **requires**]{.underline} that [the decision to
use it remains in the hands of one person]{.underline}. A decision by
committee would hardly be credible in a crisis.

WARSAW and WASHINGTON --- Last week, [Poland's Prime Minister **Donald
Tusk** stood in front of the parliament and gave a speech on the state
of **European security**]{.underline}. And in it, he made eyebrows all
across the world raise up with a declaration that [his government was
open to joining up with a **nuclear security effort**]{.underline}
proposed by Paris.

"We must also look more boldly into the future when it comes to arms
technology. We are seriously talking to the French about their idea of a
nuclear umbrella over Europe," Tusk said. "It is high time for Poland,
using not only the resources it has, but also its own experience,
experience on the battlefield, Ukrainian experience, to look more boldly
at our possibilities concerning the most modern weapons.

"At the moment --- I say this with full responsibility --- [purchases of
conventional weapons, the most traditional ones, are **not
enough**]{.underline}."

It's an extraordinary statement, but one that [experts say should not be
a full surprise, given Poland's longstanding fears about
**Russia**]{.underline}, [its aggressiveness in rearming since the
**Ukraine** **invasion**]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline} clear
[signals from **Washington**]{.underline} that the NATO alliance may not
be as iron clad as believed for decades.

Artur Kacprzyk of the Polish Institute of International Affairs says the
timing of Tusk's comment reflects real world politics.

"[It is possible that a **national nuclear option** is being floated by
the Polish government to convince the **U.S.** not to weaken **security
guarantees** for Poland]{.underline} at the time when the Trump
administration seeks a reset with Russia and indicated it would cut
military presence in Europe," Kacprzyk told Breaking Defense.

"[Poland's history makes it very clear why they are
**concerned**]{.underline} that the people they align with, and the
people they rely on for protection from Russia, will abandon them," Jon
Wolfsthal, a former US government official now with the Federation of
American Scientists, told Breaking Defense. Tusk's comments are likely
"a signal of concern --- maybe to motivate the United States, but
clearly designed to play on the French and perhaps the British. [But I
think it's also an open, **transparent signal** for **concern** in
trying to figure out how they protect themselves]{.underline}."

Added Marek Świerczyński, head of the security and international affairs
desk at the Polityka Insight center for policy analysis based in Warsaw,
"Tusk's declaration that 'Poland must reach for the most modern
possibilities also related to nuclear weapons and modern unconventional
weapons' ... [must be recognized that it is the most
far-reaching]{.underline} \[**[nuclear statement]{.underline}**\]
[because it comes from the **prime minister**]{.underline}, in
parliament and [at a time of rebuilding the **European security
order**]{.underline}."

[It **doesn't appear** the issue is going away **anytime
so**on]{.underline}. On Thursday, Polish President Andrzej Duda, [a
political opponent of **Tusk**]{.underline}, [called for the US to base
nuclear weapons on **Polish soil**]{.underline}. But analysts tell
Breaking Defense that the issue comes with major logistical, and
geopolitical, hurdles.

A Nuclear History

In the early 1960s, the Polish Army was equipped with two Soviet
nuclear-capable weapons, the 8K11 and 3R10 missiles. Due to their low
accuracy, they could only be effectively used as carriers of 3N14
nuclear warheads. Twelve of the MiG-21PFM aircraft delivered to Poland
were also adapted to carry nuclear weapons.

In the mid-1960s, Polish-Soviet talks resulted in an agreement to build
three nuclear weapons depots inside Poland, based on Soviet plans, each
equipped with two nuclear weapons stores. According to initial plans,
they were to store 178 nuclear warheads, which were to be carried by
8K11 and 3R10 missiles. Construction of the depots began in 1967 and was
completed in January 1970. Then the depots were transferred to the
Northern Group of Soviet Forces, which was to take care of the charges
until the outbreak of war with NATO, in which case control was to be
transferred to the Polish Army.

According to disclosed data, in the mid-1980s they stored 14 500-kT
warheads, 83 10-kT warheads, two 200-kT bombs, 24 15-kT bombs and 10
0.5-kT bombs. In 1991, Poland announced that they would remove the
nuclear capable delivery systems from their weapons inventory.

Still, [questions inside Poland about whether it benefits them to have
**nuclear weapons** in country has **persisted**]{.underline}. [They
only gained energy after the **Ukraine invasion**]{.underline}, [when
Poland launched a **dramatic** **reinvention** of its armed
forces]{.underline}. Tusk's statement isn't even the first time a recent
prime minister raised the issue: In June 2023, then-Prime Minister
Mateusz Morawiecki declared his interest in hosting nuclear weapons
under the NATO umbrella.

[But the push has **new energy** give]{.underline}n the events of the
last few weeks: [the dramatic White House meeting between US President
Donald **Trump** and Ukrainian President Volodymyr
**Zelenskyy**]{.underline}, the statements from European leaders that
they can no longer rely on America as a partner, and Trump's further
statements that he may not feel obligated to protect NATO nations in
case of a conflict.

According to a Feb. 21 poll, [**52.9** percent of surveyed Poles
supported the idea of Poland having its **own** **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, with 27.9 percent against. [Support for the
nuclear option is likely to **increase** if Poland's security
environment **deteriorates further**]{.underline}, especially if Russia
scores a victory in its war against Ukraine, and the US reduces its
military presence in Europe and commitment to NATO.

[Poland]{.underline} and its nuclear-armed allies might choose among
three options. It [could try to acquire its own nuclear
arms]{.underline}. Poland might join NATO\'s nuclear sharing program as
a basing country. And Warsaw might seek nuclear protection from France
and the United Kingdom.

[The West would oppose Poland obtaining its own nuclear weapons. This
would violate its obligations as a non--nuclear weapon
state]{.underline} under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. With 191

The Trump administration has consistently shown disregard for America's
European allies, whether it be in the Oval Office or at the Munich
Security Conference. The administration's actions have led France, and
other U.S. allies, to push for a European-led nuclear deterrent.
Regardless of any debate over U.S. reliability, [a European deterrent is
**economically, technically** and **politically
inadvisable**]{.underline}.

Whether the United States actually seeks to distance itself from the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance, as some have
suggested, or is trying to bully allies into increasing their
self-reliance for defense, misses the point --- Europe already thinks it
is in a position that requires it to seek new options for strategic
security.

America's NATO allies underspent on their militaries for decades. U.S.
presidents of both parties have repeatedly asked them to step up.
Russian aggression in Ukraine was a clear wake up call, and European
allies have raised their military commitments since 2022. Although
Europe's increased defense spending was long overdue, increasing nuclear
capabilities is not. Decision makers on both sides of the Atlantic
should be clear-eyed about the effects this potential shift in global
nuclear policy would have for the future security of the United States
and Europe.

The Infeasibility of a French-Led Deterrent

[France is]{.underline} the most [vocal about leading a European nuclear
deterrence effort]{.underline}. However, [nuclear weapons are
extraordinarily expensive, labor intensive and extended deterrent
infrastructure requires extensive technical
**coop**eration]{.underline}. Currently, France maintains a minimal
nuclear deterrent mostly based around submarine-based weapons. The kind
of nuclear expansion that could replace U.S. security guarantees in
Europe would require extraordinary economic and political investment
from France and other countries interested in being covered by the
umbrella.

Though [a French-led nuclear deterrent]{.underline} would not
necessarily mean nuclear proliferation from other countries in Europe,
it [would]{.underline} almost [certainly require nations without nuclear
weapons to participate in **active** economic, scientific, political and
military **support of France's nuclear expansion**. This would upset
Moscow's traditional balance of forces calculation and could **provoke a
Russian response**. A French-led deterrent only serves to trigger **more
dangerous** and **unnecessary global nuclear competition in a time of
already increased tensions**]{.underline}.

From a technical perspective, NATO nuclear sharing functions because
U.S. nuclear capabilities are the "supreme guarantee of the Alliance's
security" and any final nuclear decisions are made by the U.S.
President. American nuclear weapons in Europe therefore play a political
rather than military role and serve as the physical manifestation of the
U.S. commitment to NATO.

[Nuclear decision-making for the French-led deterrent would
be]{.underline} much more [**complicated**. Germany and
Poland]{.underline} are just two countries that [have noted]{.underline}
their [interest in the French umbrella. France, Germany and Poland may
align on the security environment]{.underline} in Europe now, [but
**this** has not and **will not always be the case**. French nuclear
forces are a national asset, and it would require an **unprecedented
policy shift**]{.underline} to allow for any sort of nuclear sharing
arrangement similar to the one currently provided by the United States.

Political and Economic Risks of a European Nuclear Deterrent

There are additional complications. For instance, [Germany has a
powerful cultural taboo against holding]{.underline} nuclear weapons and
weapons of mass destruction ([WMDs]{.underline}) generally --- [a
reluctance rooted in]{.underline} the legacy of militarism that produced
horrific human rights abuses during [World War II]{.underline}, many of
which were perpetrated against Polish citizens. In the past, NATO's
nuclear mission has been controversial for the public across Europe, and
would likely prove so again. [Expanding European nuclear
capabilities]{.underline} now, even under French leadership, [would
require engagement from entire countries' infrastructures]{.underline}
--- as such, [public opinion and resistance should not be discounted
when assessing a European deterrent's feasibility]{.underline}.

[A credible]{.underline} European [deterrent could]{.underline} also
[take **more than a decade**]{.underline} to achieve. This means [there
could be a significant period during which Europe is **left without NATO
nuclear sharing or its own deterrent**]{.underline}. Therefore, the
United States would have to decide how far its "support" would go. Would
the United States be willing to act as a backstop for European nuclear
deterrence until a European deterrent finally came online? If not,
[America's abandonment of previous commitments could create **permanent
distrust and resentment** in the transatlantic relationship,
**transforming former partners into potential
adversaries**]{.underline}. Why would the United States want resentful
countries engaging in massive nuclear expansion? And why would Russia
stand by and let them?

Additionally, a European-led deterrent would require a massive
investment in new capabilities for weapons production, new nuclear
warheads and integrated communications. As an example, the United States
spends \$75 billion each year to modernize its own nuclear arsenal. That
is more than multiple NATO allies spend annually on their entire
defense. This level of [investment would add to]{.underline} what is
already [a **fraught European economic environment** in which countries
across the continent are facing increased deficits and national debt.
The outcome could be **further political instability**]{.underline}.

Stability for the United States Requires Stability in Europe

[A French-led nuclear deterrent cannot replace U.S.-led NATO nuclear
sharing]{.underline}. Regardless of any concerns over U.S. reliability,
a French-led nuclear deterrent is economically, politically and
technically infeasible and inadvisable for both American and European
security. If the United States really wants more long-term stability and
less responsibility in Europe, it needs to support its European
partners' efforts to address their own nuclear and conventional security
threats, most notably from Russia.

[Conventional capabilities have defined]{.underline} the war in
[Ukraine]{.underline}, and [NATO is already answering the call to
increase its conventional spending]{.underline}. The United States
should build on this success. Showing partnership in addressing Russian
aggression in Ukraine and the Baltics will rebuild political faith,
hardening Europe's commitment to address its own security concerns.

[A]{.underline} possible [debate on European nuclear weapons
could]{.underline} further [empower political forces sowing disunity in
Europe and risk **eroding the** largely **stable and prosperous peace
the continent**]{.underline} (and the United States) **[has enjoyed for
decades]{.underline}**. There are too many nuclear weapons in Europe
already. [The]{.underline} U.S. (and NATO) [policy priority should be to
create conditions that will lead to a reduction in the number of nuclear
weapons, **rather than provide an excuse for France to build
more**]{.underline}.

While some in Europe have responded to uncertainty over the U.S.
commitment to NATO by reconsidering a European nuclear deterrent, the
reality is that [stepping away from NATO commitments]{.underline},
including nuclear sharing, [would not free the United States from
international security obligations]{.underline}. Instead, [it would
reduce U.S. leverage over European allies and adversaries
alike]{.underline}, potentially **[leading to more nuclear-armed
states]{.underline}** at a time when even President Donald Trump is
calling for denuclearization.

[Nawrocki is **well placed** to encourage Trump to back Ukraine and
**European security**]{.underline}

Some initial analysis may depict the Polish presidential election as a
fight between democracy and autocracy, or between a pro-Trump and
pro-European candidate. This seems exaggerated. The real challenge for
Nawrocki will be deciding whether to find common ground with the Tusk
government in the face of the threat from Russia and the need to work
with the Trump administration on behalf of European and Ukrainian
security.

There are substantive grounds for at least some cooperation across
partisan lines in Poland to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression and,
to this end, to work with key European allies, such as Britain, France,
and Germany, as well as with the United States. Unlike the Hungarian
nationalist leader Viktor Orbán, Polish nationalists and outgoing
President Andrzej Duda generally support Ukraine and resolutely oppose
Russian aggression. In early 2022, for example, PiS party leader
Jarosław Kaczyński publicly broke with Orbán over the latter's lack of
support for Ukraine at the time. Poland's current rapid military buildup
began during the previous PiS government and continued under the Tusk
coalition. Both political camps support NATO and strong relations with
the United States.

[The Trump administration **backed** **Nawrocki** during the election
**campaign**]{.underline}. However unwise US official partisanship
during an election might have been, [this will give **Nawrocki**
advantages as a perceived **ideological ally** making the case in
Washington for continued US military presence in Poland and **US
support** for **NATO** and **Ukraine**]{.underline}. Nawrocki may face
challenges working with the European Union (EU), which is still a source
of significant funding for Polish development and is trying to support
military buildup in Europe, an objective Poles across the political
spectrum tend to support. He will also have to contain the anti-German
rhetoric common to much of the Polish nationalist right. Poland has had
legitimate complaints about German policy toward Russia. But it has won
those arguments, as many Germans themselves recognize; Nawrocki would do
well to take the win and work with Germany to counter the Russian threat
both countries face.

Many Poles were supportive of Ukraine in the initial phases of the
full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, providing extensive benefits to
Ukrainian refugees and taking hundreds of thousands of them into their
homes. While the presence of so many Ukrainian refugees has grown less
popular over time, Polish support for Ukraine has remained steady.
Still, influential Polish constituencies, such as farmers and some
groups concerned with the difficult historical issues between Poles and
Ukrainians, have been skeptical about the extent of Polish support for
Ukraine. During the campaign, Nawrocki declared that he does not
currently support Ukraine's NATO accession. Now, Nawrocki will have to
find a way to balance strategic and political imperatives on support for
Ukraine.

As president, Nawrocki will have to balance his campaign rhetoric and
partisan interests with broader national interests. He's hardly the
first winning candidate to have to do so.

---Daniel Fried is the Weiser Family distinguished fellow at the
Atlantic Council and a former US ambassador to Poland.

Poland's conservative nationalism is pro-American and pro-NATO

The Poles showed their dissatisfaction with the current government and
the political establishment. Nawrocki was an outsider and that paid off.
He managed to attract the voters who chose far-right candidates in the
first round, while Trzaskowski did not manage to mobilize enough of the
voters who supported Tusk's coalition in October 2023.

For Europe, this could mean that Poland will become more inwardly
focused. At the same time, Tusk has previously signaled that he believes
beating populism requires addressing some of the issues that drive it.
Expect Poland to take a turn for the right on matters such as migration
and the European Green Deal.

[Nawrocki was the **only candidate** who visited US President Donald
**Trump** in the White House and received his
**endorsement**]{.underline}. In late May, the Conservative Political
Action Conference, known as CPAC, also held a rally in the southeastern
town of Rzeszów that featured US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi
Noem. [Nawrocki's people made **conscious outreach** to the US
**administration**]{.underline}. In Poland, [the movement that backs
Nawrocki is very **pro-American** and **pro-NATO**]{.underline}, unlike
several other parties in Europe that stand for conservative nationalism.
The optimistic scenario is that as president, [Nawrocki will establish a
**connection** with Trump that will prevent any plans to withdraw **US
troops** **from** **Poland**]{.underline}. At the same time, Tusk's
government will continue forging partnerships with other relevant
European states, such as France and the Nordic and Baltic countries.

politics; Notes From Poland, "New Polish president set for foreign
policy power struggle with government,"

Foreign policy could be a major flashpoint. "I [expect Nawrocki to be a
far **more assertive** president than Duda]{.underline}, considering his
more combative character and different vision of foreign policy. He is a
fighter," says Dr Bruno Surdel, senior fellow at the Centre for
International Relations.

Since replacing Law and Justice (PiS) in power in 2023, the ruling
coalition, led by Donald Tusk's Civic Platform (PO) party, has continued
to pursue Poland's long-standing policy of relying on the United States
for security.

However, it has also sought to repair relations with Brussels that were
damaged under the former administration. Poland revived the Weimar
triangle alliance with Germany and France and began positioning itself
as a continental leader in security and defence policy while continuing
to support Ukraine.

"The impact of Nawrocki on Polish foreign policy will above all be
indirect," says Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office at the European
Council on Foreign Relations.

"The key question is how Tusk will react to Nawrocki's rhetoric, [given
his **weakened position** after the election and awareness that
\[political\] moods have shifted owing to the election of **Trump** and
a change in \[Polish\] attitudes towards **Ukraine**]{.underline}."

The president's foreign policy powers

Under Poland's constitution, foreign policy is primarily conducted by
the government, which sets the diplomatic agenda and signs international
treaties.

However, when such treaties require parliamentary legislation, the
president can exercise his veto. The head of state also appoints
ambassadors, based on nominations submitted by the foreign minister and
approved by the prime minister.

The latter already led to a clash last year between the government and
President Duda after foreign minister Radosław Sikorski dismissed 50
PiS-era ambassadors and installed interim embassy "heads" in their
place. Among them was Bogdan Klich, who now represents Poland in the US.

[Since Nawrocki's election win, PiS has been pushing for the
presidential cabinet to reclaim control over the **US ambassadorial
appointment**]{.underline}, [pointing to **Nawrocki's** **ties** with
Donald **Trump**]{.underline}, with whom he met during his campaign, in
contrast to Klich's public criticism of the US president. Sikorski has
also admitted that Nawrocki will help improve Poland's relations with
the Trump administration.

Poland's president-elect may seek greater influence in other areas of
foreign representation. "Nawrocki could, for example, based on
legislation introduced under PiS in 2023, demand that he represent
Poland at EU summits," Buras says, adding that this would create another
chapter in the ongoing rule-of-law crisis, as the government refuses to
accept the legality of the law in question.

Trump, Europe, or both?

[A **cross-partisan political consensus** viewing the US as a **key ally
still exists** in **Poland**]{.underline}, but disagreements centre on
how to keep Washington on Warsaw's side, Buras says.

"[**Nawrocki** will, through actions and rhetoric, prioritise the need
for close, **direct cooperation** with President **Trump**]{.underline},
potentially at the expense of relations with EU partners," he explains.
By contrast, Tusk has so far sought to keep the US as a guarantor of
European and Polish security by "strengthening the EU, also through its
\[common\] defence policy".

#### Poland trusts US security for now but doesn't have full faith in Trump and wants nuclear weapons for further guarantees.

The ruling liberal coalition, headed by Prime Minister Donald [Tusk, has
always been more inclined to reinforce ties with European Union (EU)
partners, partially and implicitly at the expense of Poland's bilateral
bond with the United States]{.underline}. Hence, for instance, the
Polish government's efforts to reinvigorate the Weimar Triangle (a
diplomatic format comprising Poland, France, and Germany), as well as
its more [sympathetic approach to the intentions of Paris and Berlin to
render Europe more autonomous---both politically and militarily---and
less dependent on Washington]{.underline}. Conversely, the previous Law
and Justice party government under Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki
maintained strained relations with Brussels and kept a critical attitude
toward Germany. At the same time, it enjoyed a thriving relationship
with both the Trump and Biden administrations in Washington. Today, the
[right-wing opposition harshly chastises the coalition in power for its
"excessively pro-European tilt," accusing Tusk of deliberately trying to
"push America out of Europe," in tandem with his German and French
colleagues.]{.underline} On the other hand, government officials and
majority members of parliament lambast their political rivals for being
"blindly Trumpian." This divergence is one of the main themes of the
upcoming presidential election in Poland, the first round of which is
scheduled for May 18. In this election, the pro-European mayor of
Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, will compete with the pro-American
conservative candidate, Karol Nawrocki. (My apologies for the rather
simplistic definitions, but they largely reflect the two contenders'
foreign policy views.) Therefore, the Polish president's recent
statements should be interpreted in a broader context of internal
politics. Duda, elected ten years ago on a moderately conservative
ticket and constitutionally barred from a third term, has been
remarkably pro-American during his time in office. And since Trump's
second inauguration, [he has been adamant about the necessity of
upholding excellent relations with the United States]{.underline}. In
the above-mentioned interviews, Duda was subtle enough to simultaneously
praise French President Emmanuel Macron's recent suggestion of unfolding
the French atomic umbrella over other European NATO members.
Nevertheless, the Polish president's message was straightforward:
[Nowadays, we need US military presence on NATO's eastern flank more
than ever---even in the extreme and apparently provocative form of
nuclear warheads]{.underline}. It was a message aimed as well at the
domestic audience and the government: [You may dislike Trump's policies,
and in particular his animus toward the EU, but turning our back on the
United States now would be preposterous and suicidal]{.underline}. For
Duda and his fellow Polish right-wingers, [European "autonomy" remains a
mirage]{.underline}, an intriguing yet elusive ambition, at least for
the time being. In a nutshell: [it's not a choice between Trump's nukes
and Macron's umbrella. Poles would be happiest having both]{.underline}.
Earlier this week, Polish President Andrzej Duda overtly proposed that
[US nuclear warheads be deployed on Polish soil]{.underline}. "The
borders of NATO moved east in 1999, so [twenty-six years later there
should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east]{.underline},"
Duda said in an interview with the *Financial Times.* "I think it's not
only that the time has come, but that [it would be safer if \[nuclear\]
weapons were already here]{.underline}." The following day, he
repeated the assertion to the BBC: "Every strategic kind of
infrastructure, [American and NATO infrastructure]{.underline}, which we
have on our soil [is strengthening the inclination of the US and the
North Atlantic Alliance to defend this territory]{.underline}. " Duda's
remarks epitomize [growing uncertainty]{.underline}, or even
nervousness, [among Central Europe's political elites]{.underline}, in
light of an abrupt shift (glass half empty) or at least ambiguity (glass
half full) [of US foreign policy under Donald Trump's
presidency]{.underline}. The role of nuclear deterrence in the wider
debate on Europe's autonomous defense capabilities has become a hot
topic in several capitals, especially after the recent cooling of
transatlantic relations. European leaders have more or less openly
expressed their concerns and misgivings about the United States'
reliability as a NATO ally. However, in the Polish case, the [ongoing
discussion on the future of military cooperation with the United States
has a strong domestic undercurrent]{.underline}.

#### US and Poland alliance and goals are high and aligned

[Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth]{.underline} is calling [for closer U.S.
ties with Poland, praising its military investment and leadership on
NATO's eastern flank]{.underline} [amid a Pentagon review that could
reshape how American troops are deployed across Europe. Poland is
"leading the way" on military spending]{.underline}, Hegseth said
Tuesday during a meeting with Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw
Kosiniak-Kamysz at the Pentagon, citing the country's push to build
Europe's largest land army. The discussions also come ahead of a NATO
defense ministers meeting next week followed by a June summit of leaders
in The Hague, where defense spending will be at the top of the agenda.
["We don't have to encourage Poland,"]{.underline} Hegseth said in
reference to Warsaw's commitment to spending 5% of its gross domestic
product on defense. The [two countries share a common approach to
military matters]{.underline} [and defense spending]{.underline},
Hegseth added. Kosiniak-Kamysz said Poland supports President Donald
Trump's push to get allies to agree on a plan to increase NATO's defense
spending benchmark from 2% of GDP to 5%. "I'm also certain that it was
necessary to send Europe a strong message, a strong signal for burden
sharing within NATO, recognizing that Europe must take greater
responsibility for its own defense," Kosiniak-Kamysz said. [During the
NATO summit, which Trump will attend, allies also are anticipating more
information about the future of the American military mission in
Europe.]{.underline} When Hegseth took the Pentagon reins in January, he
launched a force posture review to assess U.S. troop levels overseas.
The review aligns with Trump administration calls for Europe to take
over most defense responsibilities in Europe. That has raised questions
about the future of the roughly 80,000 U.S. troops currently stationed
in Europe, with some allies bracing for possible reductions. Hegseth
hasn't indicated which countries are most likely to be targeted for
troop cuts. During Trump's first term, Germany was singled out for a
12,000-troop reduction, but those plans never came to fruition. Trump
has often been at odds with Germany on defense issues over the years
given Berlin's long track record of underinvesting in defense. Friedrich
Merz, the new German chancellor, has pledged to spend significantly more
on defense. And during a NATO meeting earlier this month, German
officials said they're on board with Trump's call for upping military
expenditures to 5% of GDP. [Poland, in contrast, has been held in high
regard by the current White House. About 8,000 U.S. troops are stationed
in the country, most on a rotational basis.]{.underline} In February,
Hegseth visited Poland during his first trip to Europe as defense
secretary, calling it a deliberate choice for the administration's
initial bilateral meeting. [On Tuesday, Hegseth told Kosiniak-Kamysz
that Poland's approach aligns with Trump's. "You apply combat-credible
forces and a willingness to defend your own homeland and a recognition
of defense of your borders," he said.]{.underline}

[Poland: top spender on defense]{.underline} But members of [Trump\'s
new cabinet in any case seem to see Poland as a preferred partner in
Europe. Poland was the first foreign port of call]{.underline} for US
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in mid-February. While there, [Hegseth
showered praise on this NATO ally]{.underline}, saying that Poland was
the country that understood the US best and could act as a link between
his country and Europe. [US Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg even
stopped in Warsaw on his way to Kyiv. Poland is seen as a model ally
among NATO member states]{.underline}, [aiming to spend 4.7% of its
GDP]{.underline} (gross domestic product) on defense this year. Over
[10,000 American soldiers are stationed]{.underline} at a number of
different locations around the country. [The USA is also the Polish
army\'s most important arms supplier]{.underline}, and [Poland also
remains the central hub for Western military aid for Ukraine. USA:
guarantor of Polish security From Poland\'s perspective, the USA remains
the country\'s most important guarantor of security]{.underline}. The
comments on transatlantic relations made by Friedrich Merz, the man most
likely to be Germany\'s next chancellor, on the night of the German
general election are viewed with skepticism in Warsaw. Speaking on
German television, Merz said that for him, \"the absolute priority will
be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we
can achieve real independence from the US.\" Looking to the NATO summit
at the end of June, Merz questioned whether \"we will still be talking
about NATO in its current form or whether we will have to establish an
independent European defence capability much more quickly.\" But as many
differences as they have, the g­0overnment and the opposition in Poland
agree on one thing: Polish soldiers should not be involved in a peace
mission in Ukraine. With a presidential election due to take place there
in May/June, the domestic pressure is simply too great. In a survey
conducted by IBRiS, 76% of respondents said they were against a Polish
mission of that kind and just under 18% said they were in favor. Despite
what happened in Washington at the weekend, Duda\'s faith in Trump
doesn\'t seem to have taken a dent. [Trump will \"not sell Ukraine,\" he
assured the Polish television channel Polsat News after his
visit.]{.underline}

[The U.S. remains Europe's most important ally, Poland's finance
minister told]{.underline} CNBC Tuesday, [saying it was crucial for the
bloc to find areas where it can increase trade and cooperation. He
highlighted defense and the purchasing of more U.S. military equipment
as an area where further engagement could take place.]{.underline} "[The
U.S. is the strongest and most important ally of]{.underline} the
European Union and [Poland,]{.underline} [this is why we buy a lot of
military equipment]{.underline} here in the U.S., and [why we value so
much the presence of U.S. troops in Poland]{.underline}," Andrzej
Domański told CNBC on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. "I believe it's clear for
everyone that it's time to strengthen our eastern flank of NATO \[in
Europe\] and the [U.S.′ presence is absolutely crucial]{.underline}," he
added. Defense is one domain where the EU could meet the dual needs of
rebalancing trade with the U.S. and of increasing spending in line with
the current NATO requirements. [Both matters are perennial bugbears for
President Trump when it comes to European allies]{.underline}, with whom
relations have been strained following his early-April announcement of
trade tariffs of 20% on EU imports. A global market meltdown has since
prompted the U.S. president to announce a 90-day pause on "reciprocal"
tariffs above 10% --- barring those imposed on China --- although the
moratorium ends in early July. In the interim, multiple countries, along
with the EU as a whole, are trying to negotiate bilateral trade deals
with the Trump administration. "We need to have a deal, that's crystal
clear," Domański told CNBC's Carolin Roth in Washington. "The U.S. and
European Union are very strong trading partners and the U.S. is our most
important ally and that's a fact, and this is why we need to find a good
solution." He added, "We need to use these 80 days remaining very, very
wisely and this is why the \[European\] Commission is working to find a
good solution." [Domański said there were a number of areas where trade
could increase, pointing to the EU potentially buying more U.S. military
equipment and American natural gas. Poland has escaped much of Trump's
wrath over European defense spending, given that Warsaw is looking to
invest close to 5% of its GDP on security this year and has repeatedly
called on allies to up their own contributions in the
arena.]{.underline} NATO estimates suggest that Poland spent 4.12% of
its GDP on defense in 2024, while the U.S. made an expenditure of 3.38%
of its economic output over the period. "We are asking our European
friends to do the same, to increase their defense spending," Domański
told CNBC. "It's not easy, we know budgets are tight and some countries
face fiscal challenges, but some action is really, really needed."

The division within transatlantic relations was further exemplified by
the fact that [in Warsaw, the fear among political elites of America
betraying Polish or European interests was overshadowed by]{.underline}
their [apprehension regarding the repercussions of weakening
transatlantic ties]{.underline}. In essence, [advocating for European
sovereignty as a solution to the transatlantic crisis was perceived
as]{.underline} a **[more perilous]{.underline}** path [than the ailment
it aimed to remedy]{.underline}. This [scepticism]{.underline} towards
the discourse surrounding Trump's approach to transatlantic relations in
Western Europe only [strengthened Poland's resolve to bolster its
bilateral relationship with the USA and **position itself as
Washington's key ally** in Europe]{.underline}.

Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki stated that [Poland
sought to elevate its status as an American ally]{.underline}, aiming
[to replace the]{.underline} likes of [UK]{.underline} (Buras and
Janning 2018). [This]{.underline} ambition [became a **central element
of Poland's foreign policy**]{.underline}, as [demonstrated
during]{.underline} President Andrzej [Duda's visit to Washington in
September 2018]{.underline}, where he signed a declaration that
established a strategic partnership between the USA and Poland.
Additionally, Duda's visit to President Donald Trump in 2020 marked him
as the first foreign leader to meet with Trump following global lock-
downs caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

[Rather than advocating for US defence of multilateralism, Poland chose
to **cultivate its bilateral relationship** and adapt to]{.underline}
the new dynamics under [the Trump administration]{.underline}. In a
speech in 2018, Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz acknowledged
that President [Trump had significantly altered the landscape of inter-
national politics, leading Poland to adapt to this new
reality]{.underline} (Buras and Janning 2018). During his trip to
Washington, President [Duda emphasized a]{.underline} "**[Poland
First]{.underline}**" [approach]{.underline}. In his address at the UN
General Assembly, [he diverged from his German counterpart's appeal for
the preservation of **multilat**eralism]{.underline}, instead
[criticizing the prevailing model of]{.underline} "[**usurpation and
hierarchical multila**teralism]{.underline}." [Duda advocated
for]{.underline} a "positive multilateralism" based on the principles of
[equal states and sovereign equality]{.underline} (Lanoszka 2020).\"

These [**biases** have **important implications** for alliance politics.
Allies are likely to see U.S. actions as the **willful choices** of the
U.S. government, rather than attributing them to domestic or
international constraints. For example, foreign observers
will]{.underline} tend to [see **policymaking volatility** as evidence
of Trump]{.underline} administration [**deliberately cultivating
uncertainty** rather than as the result of bureaucratic infighting or
incompetence]{.underline}. Similarly, [allies may]{.underline} tend
toward **[interpret]{.underline}**ing [**any omission** of efforts to
reinforce an alliance as a **deliberate** strategic choice to
**undermine** an alliance such as with]{.underline} Trump's [reluctance
to publicly commit to]{.underline} NATO's **[Article 5]{.underline}**.
These dynamics only serve to decrease trust, and increase the damage
that can be caused to alliances, even by "cheap" talk.

Redefining the Norms of Exchange

Since the campaign trail, Trump has frequently indicated a desire to
recast the U.S. relationship with its historical partners. He has
threatened to withdraw U.S. forces from Japan unless Japan started
paying for all of the costs, has alleged that Germany owed NATO "vast
sums of money," and so on. Although it is not unusual for U.S. officials
to complain about free riding (which, as discussed above, is a perennial
concern within alliance relationships), American alliances seem to
currently be understood in a more transactional fashion than under
previous administrations.

This shift matters because it suggests a shift in how the White House
understands the norms governing its relationships with allies. Alan
Fiske, an anthropologist who studies the structure of social
relationships, argues that there are four ideal-typical forms of
relationships, each of which is based on a different norm of exchange.14
[Robust alliances are]{.underline} often [governed by]{.underline} what
Fiske calls [**"communal sharing"** norms]{.underline}: NATO's Article
5, for example, enshrines the norm of collective defense, in which an
attack on one member of the alliance is understood as an attack on all
members because of their common membership within a group. [Allies are
**one and the same**; part of a **broader community**]{.underline}.
Trump's recent comments, however, imply [a shift]{.underline} away from
communal sharing [toward]{.underline} a different norm: **["market
pricing."]{.underline}** This form of relationship [is dictated by
**cost-benefit calculations**]{.underline}. Countries must contribute
proportional to what they have in order to receive the benefits. Allies
are business partners, rather than close friends.

Why does this shift matter? [Psychological research tells us that
applying market-pricing frameworks to relationships previously
characterized by communal sharing leads to **conflict** and
**contention**]{.underline}.15 [Actors subjected to]{.underline} these
**["taboo tradeoffs"]{.underline}** often [experience **negative
reactions**]{.underline}: when we have family over for Thanksgiving
dinner, we rarely present them with the bill afterwards because it
violates the norm of exchange around which the relationship is based.
The very act of monetizing the exchange seems taboo, just as it seems
taboo to offer to buy someone's kidney.16 [Reframing alliances in purely
**transactional terms** may **inherently undermine** cohesion and
generate distrust. It also undermines their **deterrent
power**]{.underline}, because communal sharing relationships are built
around moral motives of unity: outgroup members know that members of the
ingroup are committed to unite automatically against outsiders who pose
threats.17 In contrast, [if an alliance is based solely on market
pricing, **outsiders know**]{.underline} that with the proper incentives
[alliance members can be]{.underline} bought off or [**wedged apart**
from one another]{.underline}.

Motivated Images: From Friend to Foe

Both [leaders]{.underline} and mass publics in [international
politics]{.underline} often [have]{.underline} images or stereotypes of
other countries, **[cognitive schema]{.underline}** that actors rely on
[to make sense of international **relations**hips]{.underline}.18 Images
tend to have common structures: the "enemy image," popular during the
Cold War, for example, was of another actor of similar relative
capabilities and cultural status, but with threatening intentions; the
"colony image" was of actors with weaker relative capabilities and of
lower cultural status, who posed an opportunity rather than a threat.
Because of this schematic structure, images lead to routinized
interaction: knowing what image a decision-maker has of their
relationship with another country tells us a great deal about the policy
preferences that follow.

A decision-maker who has an enemy image of another country, for example,
will tend to see that country as being driven by malign and unlimited
motives, led by a unified regime that nonetheless can be contained by a
sufficient use of force. A decision-maker who has a colony image of
another country often tends to perceive it as being internally divided,
between good forces (led by a progressive, modernizing leader, but who
needs external support) and bad ones (led by radical fanatics or local
puppets of foreign enemies), thereby legitimating intervention to prop
up the former and quash the latter. Once images are embedded, they shape
both the kind of information we seek out, and how that information is
interpreted.

Importantly, images are motivated; what we want affects the image we
see. [The **ally image** is **undergirded** by perceived opportunities
for **mutual gain**]{.underline}, while an enemy image presents itself
when we see others as posing a threat. As the international relations
scholar Richard Herrmann notes, "as the feeling that another country has
goals that threaten one's own increases, so does the inclination to
construct a cognitive picture of that other country that features
negative items."19 In other words, [even though we often think of images
as being deeply embedded and thus resistant to change, they can **flip
quickly** based on the **presence** or absence of **conflicts of
interest**. This means that the ally image that other countries have of
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [can be
**overridden** when facing **American policy choices**]{.underline} that
violate allies' interests in stability or a liberal, rule-based
international order. It matters even if these negative images of the
United States are only held by foreign publics rather than more
pragmatic governing elites, since foreign leaders will find it harder to
make concessions in negotiations with the United States when doing so is
deeply unpopular with their publics or domestic audiences.

Furthermore, [the images we form of countries are **not only** built
around **narrow** bilateral interactions. Washington's interactions with
**others** will also shape its image with allies. For example, German
decision makers]{.underline} may [draw inferences]{.underline} about the
Trump administration's commitment to a liberal world order [not only
from]{.underline} their **[direct interactions]{.underline}** with the
administration [but from what they read and observe about]{.underline}
his domestic rhetoric and policies, his appointees, his [interactions
with **other**]{.underline} leaders and **[countries]{.underline}**, and
so on. [As a result, U.S. actions in **one domain** may well
influence]{.underline} the [judgments]{.underline} of statesmen [on
**wholly distinct** matters, **amplifying their effect** and increasing
the **speed** with which **shifts in alliance credibility** can
occur]{.underline}.

Motivated Reasoning: Impressions Stick

Whether citizens or diplomats, psychologists tell us that humans are
"goal-directed information processors" who tend to evaluate information
in a way that reinforces their pre-existing views.20 We tend to seek out
information consistent with what we already believe (what psychologists
call a confirmation bias), and heavily discount information that
challenges our priors (a disconfirmation bias). Trump's unpredictability
and incendiary rhetoric during the campaign, transition, and first
months of the administration has created an image that will be hard to
reverse. Even if Trump seeks to backtrack from his prior rhetoric and
[positions]{.underline}, the salience of his original views
**[risk]{.underline}**s [a **self-reinforcing spiral**]{.underline}, in
which information that fits that image will be more easily believed than
information that contradicts it. [Foreign allies will **seek out** and
**place more weight** on information that **confirms** their initial
impressions, and place a lower weight on disconfirming
evidence]{.underline}.

Motivated reasoning thus offers yet another mechanism through which
[alliances can **erode** once negative impressions have been
established]{.underline}. This reinforcing spiral, when combined with
the other mechanisms listed above, also shows how the effects we
describe here have the potential to persist even if the Trump
administration should be succeeded by a more conventional presidential
administration. [The greater the stressors]{.underline} the current
administration [places on the alliance system --- sending out **mixed
messages** that undermine the **cred**ibility of **U.S.
commitments**]{.underline}, or carrying out actions that prompt allies
to hedge and seek out alternate arrangements --- [the harder it will be
for future administrations to **repair the damage**]{.underline}.

Policy Implications

What does all of this mean for policymakers? We conclude by briefly
summarizing some key implications and recommendations:

U.S. policymakers seeking to manage and maintain alliances should not
place faith in their longevity being probable or automatic. Tension and
fragmentation is the historical norm in alliance relationships, and
[even U.S. alliances have the potential to **quickly
weaken**]{.underline}.

[U.S. alliances rest]{.underline} both [on the]{.underline} credibility
of threats made to adversaries, and the [**credibility** of **promises**
made to allies]{.underline}. The Trump administration has focused on the
former, but neglected the latter. Because [**cred**ibility is ultimately
a **belief** held in the **mind** of policymakers]{.underline}, it can
change even in the absence of shifts in the military balance, or in the
legal terms of U.S. treaty commitments. Both [allies']{.underline} and
adversaries' [minds can be **changed**: if allies]{.underline} and
adversaries [doubt U.S. commitments, they may **dramatically
alter**]{.underline} their [behavior]{.underline} even in the absence of
material changes on the ground. U.S. policymakers seeking to uphold U.S.
alliances should therefore not believe that material changes are the
only ones that matter.

Psychological factors are likely to mean that allies do not treat
statements or rhetoric by the Trump administration as merely "cheap
talk." On the contrary, even rhetorical statements can rapidly change
the way in which allies understand the nature of their relationship with
the United States. In general, these mechanisms are likely to exacerbate
rather than lessen the impact of any shifts that occur. Given the "bully
pulpit" that the President enjoys, and President Trump's willingness to
make policy pronouncements via Twitter, the President significant
leverage to change the nature of the U.S. alliance system even if other
cabinet members, parts of the U.S. bureaucracy, or Congress seek to
mitigate those effects.

Many of these mechanisms are self-reinforcing and interactive: they
strengthen rather than counteract each other. Furthermore,
**[states]{.underline}**~~men~~ [draw **infer**ences]{.underline} about
the administration [from the **totality** of]{.underline} its domestic
and [international behavior, **not** simply from their own **direct
experiences** of it. U.S. policymakers should expect to find it
difficult to prevent U.S. actions in **one domain** from **influenc**ing
the judgments of statesmen on **other matters**. Collectively, this has
the potential to lead to **downward spirals of confidence** in U.S.
commitments, and to **tipping points** that lead to **sudden** and
**dramatic shift**s in alliance stability, instead of slow and steady
degradations in ally confidence in U.S. commitments]{.underline}. U.S.
policymakers should therefore make preparations for contingencies that
may have previously seemed highly improbable or only plausible in the
distant future such as a sudden collapse in NATO's credibility, or South
Korean or Japanese willingness to pursue independent nuclear weapons,
both of which seem much more plausible today than would have been the
case a year ago.

The Ministerial Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe took place in Malta in early December 2024. Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov was scheduled to speak during the meeting. It
would be the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine
that Lavrov would participate in an event inside European Union
territory. When the Russian minister took the floor, his Polish
counterpart Radosław Sikorski stood up and left accompanied by a number
of other delegations. Asked about his behaviour by journalists, he
explained that he would not listen to the falsehoods spread by Lavrov,
who had come to Malta to lie about the Russian invasion and its actions
in Ukraine.

"I won't listen to these lies," the Polish foreign minister asserted,
adding that he would not sit at the same table as Lavrov.

This episode perfectly sums up the state of **[Polish-Russian
relations]{.underline}**. It would not be an exaggeration to claim that
these relations [**simply do not exist**, unless we would recognize a
relationship consisting of a sequence of **confrontational decisions and
gestures**]{.underline}.

This is not the first time that Radosław Sikorski, who became foreign
minister in autumn 2023, actively opposed Russian representatives on the
world stage. His speech from February 2024 during a session of the UN
Security Council was quite a sensation. In it he took apart the previous
arguments made by the Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya:

"Ambassador Nebenzya has called Kyiv a client of the West. Actually,
Kyiv is fighting to be independent of everybody. (...) He calls them
Nazis. Well, the president is Jewish, the defence minister is Muslim,
and they have no political prisoners. He said that Ukraine was wallowing
in corruption. Well, Alexei Navalny documented how honest and full of
probity his own country is.

He blamed the war on US neo-colonialism. In fact, Russia was trying to
exterminate Ukraine in the 19th century, again under Bolsheviks, and now
it is the third attempt," Sikorski rebutted. Western media was overcome
with excitement, going as far as describing these simple truths as a new
stage in discussion about the Russian war against Ukraine that had been
opened by the Polish minister.

Historical animosity

The determined position of Sikorski towards Russia is also supported by
Polish society, which is following the situation in Ukraine and is
worried of a potential military aggression set in motion by the Kremlin.
[The Polish security apparatus]{.underline} now [regularly reports on
the apprehension of people that have been employed by Russian
intelligence. They have collected **info**rmation and even prepared acts
of sabotage]{.underline}. Serhiy S., a citizen of Ukraine that harboured
pro-Russian views, agreed to go through with a mission requested by an
anonymous account on Telegram. He was tasked with setting a large paint
warehouse ablaze outside of Wrocław, one of Poland's largest cities.
After media covered the case in October, Sikorski declared that the
Russian consulate in Poznań would be closed and its staff expelled. This
was a response to a hostile Russian act that had been confirmed in an
investigation by Polish intelligence.

Russia would soon decide to react in a reciprocal manner in line with
its diplomatic custom, closing the Polish consulate in St Petersburg.

It was the diplomats from this consulate that were stunned in 2023 when
they discovered that a monument commemorating Poles murdered during the
Great Terror had disappeared from the Levashovo Memorial Cemetery -- a
burial ground for victims of Stalinist repression. In December 2024,
just after the consulate of the Russian Federation was forced to shut in
Poznań, a memorial to the soldiers of the Polish Home Army that died in
Soviet gulags was destroyed in Novgorod Oblast. [The destruction of
Polish places of remembrance by unknown perpetrators in Russia has
become a disturbing reoccurrence. This **includes burial
grounds**]{.underline}. These incidents usually lead to a protest note
issued to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the
Russian point of view, the attacks on Polish cemeteries and memorials is
a justified response. This is based on what they claim are hostile acts
by Poland which, through a decommunization law, has removed hundreds of
monuments commemorating the "liberation of the country by the Red Army".
In fact, no such monuments have been removed from the many Red Army
cemeteries around the country, which are well maintained and under state
protection.

In 2022, the year of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there was
a confrontation involving gestures of a smaller significance. However,
they are just as symptomatic with regards to Polish-Russian relations.
[The Polish]{.underline} "[Commission for the Standardization of
Geographical Names]{.underline}" [decided]{.underline} that [the only
correct term]{.underline} from then on [for]{.underline} what was
earlier known as [Kaliningrad, is]{.underline} Królewiec ([the Polish
name]{.underline} for the historically German Königsberg). This symbolic
gesture was explained by the fact that today's Russian name honours the
Bolshevik criminal Mikhail Kalinin, who was partly responsible for the
Katyn massacre among other crimes. In Polish, the city is now known as
Królewiec instead of Kaliningrad and the oblast has been renamed as
obwód królewiecki (Kaliningrad Oblast). In this specific case, the
"symmetric response" came on a regional level. The governor of the
territory at the time announced that a statue of Mikhail
Muravyov-Vilensky would be constructed. The Russian imperial statesman
who brutally supressed the Polish uprising against tsarist rule in the
19th century was known as the "strangler" or "hangman" in Poland,
Lithuania and Belarus. The statue was unveiled to great fanfare in
Kaliningrad in 2023.

A new Cold War?

[Polish-Russian relations have gone down a path of declarations of
animosity and hostile gestures **devoid of any real communication**. The
confrontational character displayed by the two]{.underline} sides [can
be traced back]{.underline} to around [a decade]{.underline} ago.
[Regardless of the misunderstandings]{.underline} between Warsaw and
Kyiv, [Poland has **unambiguously** and **consistently condemned** the
**Russian aggression** towards Ukraine since 2014]{.underline} -- be it
in its hybrid or military form. [Polish politicians, experts, as well as
those involved in public diplomacy have made great efforts to convince
their western partners]{.underline} that [Russia has become a real
threat to Europe. The Kremlin did]{.underline} [therefore not view
Poland as a partner it could enlist to test the unity of the
EU]{.underline} or the broader West, [as it has done with]{.underline}
Orban's [Hungary]{.underline} ([now also]{.underline} Fico's
[Slovakia]{.underline}). As a result, [it focused on portraying Poland
as a country **dominated by a radical and irrational Russophobic
sentiment** in its propaganda]{.underline}. The year 2022 showed that
the Polish warnings were motivated by a rational assessment of the
situation rather than Russophobia.

[Russia was not able to find]{.underline} many [partners to talk to in
Poland]{.underline}, where any relationship between a politician and
their regime would result in ostracism. This is amplified by essentially
absent levels of support for their brutal war against Ukraine in Polish
society. [The Kremlin]{.underline} instead [decided on]{.underline} a
different approach towards Poland in 2021 and 2022, namely [**targeting
the Polish-Ukrainian alliance**. Russian propaganda began pushing the
idea]{.underline} that [the Polish authorities were open to a partition
of Ukraine]{.underline}. According to this narrative, in a scenario in
which Russia took control over the country's eastern oblasts, Poland
would send its military into the western regions of Ukraine. These areas
used to be part of the Polish state before the Second World War.

[The goal]{.underline} of pushing this agenda [was to sow distrust among
Ukrainians towards Poland as a partner and ally on the one hand,
while]{.underline} on the other [provoking discussion among revanchist
circles inside Poland]{.underline}. As it turned out, these groups are
on the fringe of the fringe and do not have any role among the public
and no influence on society. None of the political forces that hold
weight would start such a discussion on this topic. The [mainstream
parties were quick to condemn and oppose the Russian ideas]{.underline}.
This Russian propaganda and disinformation narrative can be seen as an
interesting projection of the methods and goals Moscow applies to other
countries. [The Kremlin views Poland as a rival after all, even if
weakened and not entirely independent with regards to NATO and its
alliance with the US]{.underline}. This all involves the same sphere of
influence in the post-Soviet area that Russia fights to control and
subordinate.

In a certain sense the Kremlin is right, because [Poland really wants
its neighbouring countries in the East, as well as the]{.underline}
countries of the [Caucasus]{.underline}, such as Georgia, [to strengthen
their statehood and **deepen their integration with western
structures**, building stable democracies]{.underline} based on the rule
of law. The difference is that Russia employs hard power to achieve its
goals: waging war; organizing provocations; launching hybrid attacks;
intimidating the societies of these countries; and engaging in
large-scale attempts at corruption. This was seen during the recent
election and referendum in Moldova.

[Poland has for years tried to pursue a totally different policy towards
this region]{.underline}. The best example of this is the Eastern
Partnership that was initiated by Poland with Swedish support as part of
the European Neighbourhood Policy. [It presented an opportunity for
countries that became independent following the collapse of the Soviet
Union to **move closer to the EU** in]{.underline} what could be [a
transition]{.underline} stage [for further potential integration with
the community. Russia has viewed this]{.underline} project [as an
attempt to interfere in]{.underline} what it considers [its sphere of
influence, which]{.underline} in turn [fuelled anti-Polish sentiments in
the Kremlin]{.underline}.

No reset

All these [misunderstandings and fundamental differences]{.underline} in
their worldviews [were not tempered by an attempt at a reset in
Polish-Russian relations]{.underline}. This was [emboldened by the
Russian-American reset]{.underline} during the Obama administration. The
most visible displays of this during this short period were the meeting
of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Russian President Vladimir Putin in
Sopot, as well as the spontaneous and empathetic reaction from Russian
society following the Smolensk air disaster in 2010. A "Centre for
Polish-Russian Dialogue and Understanding" was set up both in Poland and
in Russia during this time. Together they were supposed to overcome the
stereotypes and prejudices that exist between Poles and Russians,
alongside building up neighbourly relations and a partnership for the
future. Both these centres stopped working together after 2014, when it
turned out that the Russian side had organized trips to occupied Crimea
for Polish youth. The Polish centre changed its name to the Mieroszewski
Centre after the Russian full-scale invasion of 2022 and declared that
it would now engage in a dialogue with representatives of other
societies in Eastern Europe. It would do so while remaining committed to
supporting Russian civil society.

[What remains for Poland in its relations with Russia]{.underline}, or
rather Russians, [is to]{.underline} primarily [support the
anti-Putinist opposition and anti-war movements as an investment in
future relations]{.underline}. With regards to the policy towards the
regime, [the most effective approach remains to firmly and consistently
support Ukraine, its resistance, and the international alliances of
which Poland is a part]{.underline}. Today, **[no one has to convince
anyone that Russia is a real threat to its neighbours and western
liberal democracy in general]{.underline}**.

With regard to priorities within the Atlantic Alliance, [CEE countries
have **recurrent apprehension** that]{.underline} pursuit of [better
relations with Russia will **come at their expense**]{.underline}; as a
Polish defense official once said, "The smell of Yalta is always with
us."84 They appreciate the potential for diplomatic interchange and arms
agreements---in combination with military measures---to help manage the
security dangers presented by Moscow. But [their sense of these dangers
is greater than that of allies to the west]{.underline} and [they worry
that]{.underline} efforts at [engagement with Russia can **go too
far**]{.underline}. For example, [CEE members]{.underline}, which
[consider]{.underline} further [NATO enlargement
advantageous]{.underline} to their own security, viewed the decision at
the April 2008 Bucharest summit to postpone Membership Action Plans for
Georgia and Ukraine as an unwise concession to Russia, which opposes the
accession of either country to the alliance. [They]{.underline} also
[felt that Russia paid **no serious price** for]{.underline} its
invasion of [Georgia]{.underline} four months later, [and that
the]{.underline} return to more normal relations with Moscow, including
the U.S. "[reset]{.underline}" policy, [was]{.underline} at best
**[premature]{.underline}**. 85 The September 2009 decision by the
United States to cancel plans for the Third Site interceptors in Poland
and radar in the Czech Republic, in favor of the EPAA defense, was
widely perceived in Central and Eastern Europe as another sacrifice to
the reset with Russia.86 Poles and Czechs reacted strongly against the
decision, because the planned missile defense components were seen as
symbols of the U.S. security commitment, and because consultations prior
to the announcement were judged inadequate. The deputy head of the
National Security Bureau in [Poland]{.underline} publicly
[suggested]{.underline} the [change represented]{.underline}
"**[appeasement]{.underline}**," while the foreign minister concluded,
"if we are to look to somebody, we have to look to ourselves."87
Similarly, the Czech prime minister under whom the radar agreement was
negotiated said, "it is not good news for the Czech state, for Czech
freedom and independence. This puts us in a position wherein were are
not firmly anchored in terms of partnership, security and alliance, and
that's a certain threat."88 [These experiences]{.underline} and others
[are one reason CEE countries are]{.underline} likely to be [**leery of
negotiations with Moscow** to place limits on nonstrategic nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.

[The clearest outcome of]{.underline} this [posture that seeks great-
power accommodation]{.underline} and puts a premium on technological
solution [has been that]{.underline} U.S. [allies are
**nervous**]{.underline} while rivals are emboldened. [Alliances are
**fragile** associations, and their existence is **contingent** on
multiple factors, ranging from]{.underline} the **[political
will]{.underline}** of the parties that makes the alliance possible [to
the]{.underline} larger **[geopolitical environment]{.underline}** that
makes it necessary. [They therefore require **constant maintenance**,
mitigating]{.underline} the [**fear** that the alliance will not
increase]{.underline} the [security]{.underline} of its signatories.

[Historically, the greatest fear of the **weak**er allies is that of
**abandonment**]{.underline}, which in its broadest connotation means
that not all involved actors consider credible the security guarantees
offered to a state. The clearest form of abandonment is when one side
reneges on the security commitments to the other party, like in the case
of France and Great Britain negotiating with Nazi Germany in 1938 over
their ally Czechoslovakia. But abandonment can take other, less
conspicuous forms, driven in part by the fear of entrapment that the
less dependent and more powerful ally may have. The stronger ally, in
fact, wants to avoid being dragged into a local conflict instigated by
its smaller ally, a conflict in which it has few immediate interests at
stake.73 To do so, it is tempting to ignore, or even undermine, the most
immediate security concerns of the weaker, more dependent ally. The goal
is to sidestep a war or tensions deemed unnecessary and distracting from
more important objectives. The weak fear abandonment; the strong fear
entrapment.74

[A distant **maritime power**, such as the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [is **particularly susceptible** to this
entrapment anxiety. Geographic distance removes the **perception of
immediacy** of the threat and puts a **premium** on global stability,
often at the expense of]{.underline} local **[allies'
interests]{.underline}**. Such an approach was visible in U.S. foreign
policy toward East Asia in the early Cold War, when the objective was
not just to contain China but also to restrain U.S. allies from engaging
in "little wars" that had the potential of escalating into great- power
confrontation with China and the Soviet Union.75 [It is]{.underline}
also [possible to observe similar]{.underline} U.S. [behavior
in]{.underline} the Middle East, East Asia, and **[Central
Europe]{.underline}** in recent years. Washington seems preoccupied more
with the possibility that some of its frontline, small, and exposed
allies would engage in an overly aggressive foreign policy than with the
persistent rhetorical aggressiveness and geopolitical expansion of the
rival powers. In the Middle East, Washington often seems more worried
about a potential Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities than
about Tehran's policies.76 Israel, on the other hand, fears a nuclear
Iran and frets at any sign of U.S. neglect. Similarly, in East Asia, the
United States is always preoccupied with an overly assertive ally, such
as Japan in the South China Sea disputes that could draw American forces
into a local conflict, insignificant to Washington while vital to Tokyo.
And [in Central Europe, states such as **Poland** express their
disappointment]{.underline} in the uselessness of the United States as
an ally, while Washington worries about an anti- Russian Poland spoiling
Moscow's promises of geopolitical cooperation.

The challenge is that the answer to entrapment fears often is a
reluctance to support firmly the smaller ally and a posture of
accommodation toward the common rival. This generates ally nervousness.
As Glenn Snyder puts it, "The most undesirable side effect of
conciliating the adversary is that it entails the risk of abandonment by
the ally. His fear that one is contemplating realignment may induce him,
not to try to discourage this by becoming more accommodative, as
suggested above, but to realign preemptively or at least move closer to
the opponent. "77 [An attitude that **deprioritizes** allies **forces**
those states to **reconsider** their **fo**reign **po**licy
preferences]{.underline}. As we will discuss in the next chapter, such
behavior on the part of the United States also emboldens our rivals.

[The North Atlantic Alliance's nuclear deterrence capabilities **are now
adequate** to the situation of the international security
environment]{.underline}. However, it is necessary to design nuclear
deterrence capabilities that will be sufficient for future challenges
and threats, which may also cover the spectrum of nuclear confrontation.
It is assessed that NATO should adapt the concepts and strategies for
the use of nuclear weapons in a defensive variant and improve collective
capabilities in operationalizing the use of such deterrence. The steps
to taken by the Alliance to improve the operational capabilities of
nuclear deterrence are based on increasing the readiness of dual-use air
assets, increasing the resilience of means of delivery and command and
control mechanisms, and raising the ability to protect conventional
forces in support of a potential nuclear deterrent operation. It is
estimated that [increasing operational capabilities]{.underline} in the
area of nuclear weapons [will be ensured by intensification of NATO's
nuclear deterrence exercises]{.underline}, similar to the annual
Steadfast Noon exercise. It is assumed that the North Atlantic Alliance
should also put emphasis on training air force units in practicing
procedures for carrying nuclear charges and striking ground targets. In
the context of the development of operational capabilities, the increase
of nuclear forces in Europe should be considered. First of all, this
would reduce the risk associated with the availability of US
intercontinental forces, which could be transferred to the different
place of operations such as to the Pacific Theater in event of a
conflict. The North Atlantic Alliance should consider increasing the
number of member states that provide F-35 aircraft as a means of
delivering US nuclear warheads. In addition, it would be sensible to
increase the intensity of the debate on expanding the list of countries
on whose territory nuclear weapons are located under Nuclear Sharing. At
this point, it should be understood in particular as the concept of
deploying nuclear weapons in the countries of NATO's Eastern Flank.
However, this is not an easy task, given the operational shortcomings
associated with the limited delivery capabilities of nuclear bombs. It
is assumed that the next challenge in the process of increasing NATO's
nuclear deterrence capabilities in Europe will be the modernization of
the means of delivery of nuclear warheads. Firstly, the modernization of
the air force fleet in the context of dual-purpose air- craft should be
assessed positively. The North Atlantic Alliance should also focus on
measures that indirectly support nuclear operations - precision weapons,
drones and electronic warfare systems. It is also crucial to develop
defensive capabilities, especially against Russian intercontinental
missiles. This is seen as an opportunity for the United States to deploy
maritime anti-ballistic missiles in Europe, which have the ability to
counter intercontinental ballistic missiles in their middle (lower)
phase of flight (Kacprzyk 2023, pp. 19-23). Strategic independence
dictates the need to have organic nuclear deterrence capabilities for
European NATO members. [There is a view that France could become an
independent donor of]{.underline} these types of [weapons among European
NATO members]{.underline}. However, [**this is not a complete solution**
due to several objective problems]{.underline}. First, [there is a
**risk of a lack of decision-making in the French government** regarding
issues related to making French nuclear assets available to other
countries. France has always insisted on **complete sovereignty** over
its nuclear arsenal]{.underline} („forces de frappé") [and all related
decisions]{.underline}. Secondly, [the French arsenal is not prepared to
play such a role due to a quantitive **difference in potential**. France
has]{.underline} a relatively small number of [290 warheads. In the
event of a full-scale war, an adversary such as Russia, which possesses
thousands of warheads, might have the temptation and the ability to
**destroy these capabilities with a first pre-emptive strike**. Nuclear
deterrence only works if there is an analogous response]{.underline} to
a first attack. Let us not forget that nuclear weapons are one thing,
but [appropriate storage locations and means of transport are another.
For reasons of doctrinal and political assumption, France has **less
capacity to project a nuclear deterrence**]{.underline} (according to
the escalation ladder) [than the US and the Russian
Federation]{.underline}. This is [due to the **limited types of nuclear
missiles and their nature**. France has a **reduced capability for** the
**operational use** of tactical nuclear weapons, which is most desirable
in a modern theatre]{.underline} of war. **[It is]{.underline}** also
**[hard to believe that France would deploy its nuclear umbrella over
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and take the burden of
responsibility for making French nuclear weapons available to its

#### The umbrella [alone]{.underline} is [meaningless]{.underline} because the plan shreds the [perception]{.underline} of shared priorities

Łukasz **Kulesa 10**, Analyst of International Security and Acting Head
of the Research Office at the Polish Institute of International Affairs,
"Extended Deterrence and Assurance in Central Europe", in Perspectives
on Extended Deterrence, Ed. Tertrais, p. 117

[**Nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}, be it at the disposal or NATO
countries or Russia, [have **only marginal** importance in the public
discourse and for the policymakers in Central Europe]{.underline}. The
increased demand for re-[**assurance**]{.underline} about the
credibility of security guarantees of NATO and the United States works
at different levels, and [should **not** be **artificially narrowed
down** to the issue of credible nuclear extended deterrence, or the
continued presence of the US **tac**tical nuclear weapon**s** in
Europe]{.underline}.5

\[FOOTNOTE\] 5 According to publicly available information, [the issue
of US tactical **nuc**lear weapon**s** in Europe it is considered a
**secondary** one in the **overall** reflection about the
**cred**ibility of Art. 5]{.underline}. No willingness to increase the
operational profile of nuclear weapons or to change the "three no-s"
policy is expressed in the open fora. Additionally, many experts and
officials in Central Europe express reservations about starting a debate
at NATO which could result in a US decision to withdraw the nuclear
weapons from Europe. It is highlighted that such developments would
create additional platform of conflict between the Allies and send the
message of Alliance downgrading the collective defence function. Also,
it is pointed out that the US and some allies may opt for quick gains
("global zero" agenda) instead of seriously debating the role of nuclear
weapons for deterrence, and possible replacements. \[END FOOTNOTE\]

[From the **point of view of** the **Central Europe**an "consumers" of
extended deterrence, **as important** as the **existence** of the
adequate military **means** to fulfil the defence pledge is the
**psychological component** -- the **belief** that the providers of
extended deterrence **share their threat perception** and **understand
their sensitivities**]{.underline}.

NATO. At the psychological and political levels, [the countries of the
region expect their partners at NATO to recognize that **Russia**'s
policy may be a source of potential **threat**s to the NATO Member
States and the partners in the joint neighbourhood]{.underline}.
Accordingly, the Alliance should not ignore the provocative actions of
Moscow in the interest of maintaining the policy of engagement with
Russia.6 [Defining the **limits** of the "pragmatic partnership" would
help to offset the impression that the Alliance has adopted a *de facto*
policy of not upsetting Russia]{.underline}. A strong signal of the
shared perception of security threats would ideally be included in the
new NATO strategic concept document.

#### It must be [interwoven]{.underline} within a credible [overall posture]{.underline}, which depends on [careful management]{.underline} of [non-military political ties]{.underline}

Mark **Fitzpatrick 16**, Executive Director of IISS-Americas, Former US
Foreign Service Officer and Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Non-Proliferation, Asia's Latent Nuclear Powers, p. 167-168

The reality, however, is that [nuclear use is neither credible nor
necessary for deterring most of the threats that America and its
partners may face in Northeast Asia]{.underline}. Modernised
conventional capabilities can be better calibrated to counter the entire
range of potential provocations, with none of the taboos that have
become attached to nuclear weapons. Nuclear deterrence remains vital, of
course, particularly to deter nuclear threats. But [**other forms** of
deterrence will come into play earlier in **nearly every scenario**.
Washington thus has **sought assiduously** to address Japanese and ROK
anxieties about **low-level provocations** by **sustaining capabilities
across the spectrum**. US **non-military** engagement in East Asia,
including free trade pacts and **political ties**, **further enhances
the credibility** of US deterrence]{.underline}. Attributing special
significance to a "nuclear umbrella" helps to reassure allies, but it is
a misnomer. [Atomic retaliation is but **one threat** of what **must
be** an **interwoven fabric** of the deterrence posture]{.underline}.

#### Russia will accelerate [political warfare]{.underline}, undermining support for the west.

[Russia's political warfare strategy is to **remove Western influence**
and **reestablish Moscow's hegemony** in the Caucasus and Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. It's attempting to do so [by exploiting peoples'
fears that their identity and welfare are threatened. Key identity
issues are minority group grievances, and religious and cultural values.
Welfare issues are based on economic needs]{.underline} or threats to
those needs. [These fears are turned into narratives to convince
people]{.underline} that [the West is the **source of their problem**s
and that Russia and pro-Russian governments are the
solution]{.underline}.

However, [Russia's political warfare]{.underline} strategy has a major
flaw; it [offers people **only the past**]{.underline} and not a future.
[The **U**nited **S**tates has an opportunity to]{.underline} combat
these operations, overturn Russian successes, and [reinforce liberal
democratic values]{.underline}. While America is already engaged in
these frontline states, many of their citizens offer constructive
criticism on how US efforts can be improved. [There is a palpable fear
of Russian aggression]{.underline} in most states, [but also a belief
that **only the U**nited **S**tates **has the** military, economic, and
moral **power to protect them**]{.underline}.

#### China and Russia will [fill the vacuum]{.underline}.

Eastern Europe ([CEE]{.underline}), [where most]{.underline} countries
have [only allied with the **U**nited **S**tates since]{.underline}
around [the turn of the century, **neither formal
alliances**]{.underline} such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) **[nor informal or bilateral agreements have]{.underline}** grown
[**the roots necessary** to weather any storm. **Actions**]{.underline}
and reactions [**by the U**nited **S**tates have the potential to

To some extent, this reasoning is valid. [The war provides a clearer and
more immediate]{.underline} (even [existential]{.underline}) [threat
than any since the end of the Cold War]{.underline} and, in theory, this
threat could come to form a "glue" binding the Alliance together more
tightly with time. Russia's aggressive behavior may strengthen alliance
solidarity. But [beneath]{.underline} the surface of [formal shows of
unity]{.underline} such as that at the 2014 Wales NATO Summit, the
[Ukraine]{.underline} conflict [has **changed the priorities of** the
**threatened states**]{.underline} much more along the lines of
traditional effects of war -- namely, [the spectrum of]{.underline}
diplomatic and military [responses]{.underline} has [widened to include
sub-regional ententes, military self-help, or searches for some
accommodation with]{.underline} the threatening [Russia]{.underline}.
Well [before]{.underline} the invasion of [Crimea]{.underline}, a trend
toward [diversification in CEE foreign policies had begun to
manifest]{.underline} itself, as the regional security and political
environment became more competitive. The 2008 Georgia War prompted some
frontline NATO states to invest more conspicuously in defense, a
tendency reinforced by years of Russian military posturing and
assertiveness. The [drawdown of U.S. forces in Europe]{.underline},
together with a perceived cooling of American commitment to frontline
allies during the Russia Reset period, [prompted]{.underline} most
[states]{.underline} in the region [to **reevaluate their diplomatic
positions in favor of**]{.underline} either greater alignment with the
EU, cooperation with nearby states or [diplomatic openings to
**Moscow**]{.underline}---or in some cases, all three.

### Poland\-\--Link\-\--AT: Troops Solve

#### Troops don't solve.

Maria **Mälksoo 24**, Associate Professor of Political Science at the
University of Copenhagen, Ph.D. in International Studies from the
University of Cambridge, "NATO\'s new front: deterrence moves eastward,"
International Affairs, Vol. 100, No. 2, March 2024, accessed 07-14-2025,
https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae008, DG

[Notwithstanding the]{.underline} 'overwhelming [superiority of
NATO]{.underline} both in terms of technology and troops' vis-à-vis
Russia, [there remains a]{.underline} '[need]{.underline}' [to
**politically reassure the allies**]{.underline}.80 While rarely
expressed in public, [the eastern flank host nations\' anxieties about
the credibility of the allied tripwire in the Baltic region, and whether
or not the reinforcement would actually materialize, are
**real**]{.underline}: 'those [people who attend closely to how this
soup is being made are **very pessimistic**]{.underline} ... [there is
plentiful thinking that we have a couple of years of grace now, and
then]{.underline} ...' 81

Still, the presence of allied forces in the eastern flank is taken as an
indication that NATO views Baltic security as a function of allied
security,82 although [NATO is]{.underline} '[like a big ship: it **moves
slowly** and **can be turned only with difficulty**]{.underline}'.83
[eFP is there to **change the calculation on the Russian**
**side**]{.underline}---'if they were to invade, they would sustain a
lot of casualties'.84 From an eFP framework nation\'s perspective, 'we
are doing it because we are committed and like to think that NATO
matters ... in our view, NATO as a club relies on collective security
and so you have to demonstrate what that means in reality.'85 Indeed,
'our deployment in Estonia reminds every soldier what the Washington
Treaty means.'86 Pragmatically, forward presence of allied forces has an
added military benefit for the alliance to thus develop and maintain its
interoperability,87 for

> It is good to have armed forces doing what the armed forces are
> supposed to do---it\'s no good having them sitting back in Salisbury
> or Gatwick---going to run four miles a day and fire their weapons in
> the range. It\'s good to have them out and about, build the
> interoperability. And then the prestige element as well---even though
> the UK forces are now an absolute mess, they still command a certain
> amount of respect---being the head of this kind of operation
> contributes to that.88

Training 'nearer where the very likely adversary is \[makes\] it much
more for real'.89 On a political level, [the set-up of the eFP framework
nations in the Baltic states has]{.underline} further [unfolded as an
exercise on the part of the **U**nited **S**tates to remobilize the
European allies to contribute more emphatically towards the allied
defence effort]{.underline}: 'do something, be the bloody tripwire'---as
a Baltic diplomat privy to the negotiations over the allied presence in
the region from the early days following the annexation of Crimea
described the American rationale behind the original eFP set-up.90 [From
the perspective of the Baltic host nations, the main
message]{.underline} throughout the development of NATO\'s eFP model
[pertained to the military credibility and meaningfulness of the allied
presence]{.underline}.91 Emphatically, [it is stressed now and again
that the allied deterrence in the eastern flank **must not be a 'paper
tiger'**]{.underline}.92 Prompted by US President Joe Biden\'s
post-February 2022 discourse, the [eastern flank states began arguing
that with the tripwire, NATO could not protect every inch of its
territory]{.underline} '[unless it protects forward]{.underline}'---and
hence the Cold War era concept of forward defence was brought out
again.93 After all, in principle, the concepts of forward presence and
tripwire have not changed.94 The symbolic significance of NATO\'s
recently adopted forward defence approach for the alliance\'s eastern
flank currently outperforms NATO\'s substantively still more
tripwire-like presence in the region. Meanwhile, it certainly features
as an instance of creative improvisation for the post-Cold War
alliance,95 departing from NATO\'s 'largely static' Cold War patterns.96

Third, our findings challenge key tenets of the reassurance literature,
which generally holds that [allies worry about abandonment and seek to
restrain their adversaries **at all costs**]{.underline}. Consequently,
effective reassurance policies must include strong, costly
demonstrations of strength and commitment. [Many
scholars]{.underline}---[including some whose work focuses on
Central--Eastern Europe]{.underline}---[explicitly argue]{.underline}
that [sizable, in-theater military capabilities are most helpful because
they directly raise the costs of an attack]{.underline} for the
aggressor while [signaling that the guarantor has enough]{.underline}
"[skin in the game]{.underline}" not to abandon allies. [Yet we find
that, at least during a major crisis, **respondents neither changed
their perceptions of US capabilities in response to US forward
deployments nor did respondents look**]{.underline} particularly
**[favorably upon increasing troop presence]{.underline}**. Rather,
[respondents favored **more cautious policies** that provided better
management of alliance risks. They]{.underline} thus
[preferred]{.underline} reassurance options that have often been
dismissed as ineffective---namely,
[sanctions]{.underline}---[or]{.underline} "cheap talk"---namely,
[reiterations of existing security guarantees]{.underline}. Respondents
may prefer the nonescalatory nature of these policies amid an already
intense security crisis.

politics and policy; Financial Times, "Poland must look at acquiring
nuclear weapons, says Donald Tusk,"

Accessed 7.16.25\]

[Poland **must** consider acquiring **nuclear weapons
capabilities**]{.underline}, its prime minister has said, [as it
confronts **Russia** and the **possibility** of a **US retreat** from
Europe]{.underline}.

[Donald Tusk said that Poland]{.underline} "[must reach for the most
**modern possibilities**, also related to **nuclear weapons** and modern
unconventional weapons]{.underline}", in a landmark speech to parliament
that made stark the country's need to increase its defence capabilities
to confront a much more threatening global environment.

"[I say this with full responsibility, it is **not enough** to purchase
**conventional weapons**, the **most traditional**]{.underline}
[ones]{.underline}. The battlefield is changing before our eyes from
month to month," Tusk told lawmakers on Friday.

[US President Donald Trump's threats to stop **protecting European
allies** and his decision to cut off military aid to Ukraine in an
attempt to force immediate peace talks with Russia have **spooked**
European **capitals** and prompted a drive to drastically increase
defence spending and **military capabilities**]{.underline} that for
generations have been provided by Washington.

French President Emmanuel Macron this week said he was willing to open a
"strategic debate" with European countries interested over whether and
how France's nuclear deterrence capabilities could benefit the region.
Macron made the offer on Wednesday in response to a call from Germany's
chancellor in waiting Friedrich Merz, and countries such as Lithuania,
Latvia and others said they were interested in exploring the options.

Warsaw was "[talking seriously with the French about their idea of ​​a
**nuclear umbrella** over Europe]{.underline}", Tusk said in his speech.

The French nuclear arsenal is smaller than that of the US, and the
country's doctrine says the president's choice of whether to ever use
them is guided by its "vital interests" that do have a "European
dimension". In contrast, US nuclear weapons help secure Europe through a
more fleshed out nuclear sharing agreement that is part of Nato and
positions warheads in countries including Germany and Italy.

"We also need to look more boldly into the future in terms of arms
technology," Tusk said. "[It is high time for Poland, using both the
means it has]{.underline}, as well as its own experience, as well as
experience on the battlefield, the Ukrainian experience, [to look boldly
at our capabilities regarding the **most modern weapons**]{.underline}.

"[We are facing a **very serious race**]{.underline}. And this is a race
for security, not a race to war," Tusk said.

[Tusk also proposed more than **doubling Poland's army** to 500,000
troops]{.underline} and establishing a system of compulsory military
training for all adult men by the end of the year.

#### The UK and France's new nuclear sharing agreement comes at a time when confidence in the US is on the brink and perceptions towards using nuclear weapons are increasingly becoming more favorable.

Amidst a state visit this week steeped in the past with royal carriage
rides, state dinners and agreements to lend each other priceless
artifacts, France and the United Kingdom also made a major announcement
with their eyes on an uncertain future. The two countries agreed to
intertwine their nuclear security and to work together to protect the
rest of Europe against nuclear threats. That, of course, is something
that Europe has long relied on the United States for. Here to talk
through the agreement and its implications is Jon Wolfsthal. He\'s a
security analyst currently serving as director of global risk at the
Federation of American Scientists. Welcome back to the show. Thanks for
having me on. So how significant is this? And what does it tell you
about the shifts in the alliances that have really shaped the last 80
years or so of global policy? Well, I think it is important anytime
nuclear weapons are discussed by heads of state. Obviously, it has
significance. But this has really, I think, a lot of implications for
both Europe and the United States and the world. For many years, France
has wanted to maintain true independence for its nuclear forces. The
United Kingdom obviously has its own nuclear forces but is heavily
reliant on the United States. And so for the leaders of both Britain and
France to publicly align themselves on their nuclear policy, to state
explicitly that any threat to Europe is a threat to them and could
involve nuclear weapons, is, I think, a significant statement. And it
also shows, I think, two things that both [leaders are]{.underline}
really concerned about. One, they are [worried about the threat from
Russia to NATO territory and the way that that can destabilize every
aspect of European life. And they are quite concerned about the
durability and the credibility of America\'s commitment to NATO, and
they want to try to protect against both uncertainties - Putin
aggression and American intransigence]{.underline} (ph). Before we keep
talking more broadly, two quick clarifications - first of all, can you
just contextualize what exactly changes here? It\'s not like France and
the U.K. are going to have joint decision making on whether or not to
use weapons, right? It\'s more of just kind of - what\'s the best way to
think about this? Yeah, I think it\'s coordination. I think there are
two things going on here. One is simply signaling or doctrinal. With the
U.K. having gone through Brexit, with France having an independent
nuclear force that\'s not always aligned with NATO, it\'s important for
the two countries to say, we can\'t live without Europe, so that [if
there\'s a threat to the Baltics or Poland or Finland, that immediately
involves the British and French strategic interest and could involve
nuclear weapons.]{.underline} That\'s the basis of deterrence. You want
to inject uncertainty into the mind of an adversary, and so I think the
declaratory policy here is significant. But there is a concern that
because Russia has about 5,000 nuclear weapons, and together, Britain
and France have about 500 nuclear weapons, independently, those two
countries can\'t do enough to really deter Russia. And so [what they
want to do is coordinate more effectively to determine if are going to
have to rely on nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and God forbid nuclear
weapons would actually have to be employed, can they do more together
than they could do independently? And I think those consultations are
just beginning, but the fact that they\'re going to set up a steering
committee, that the heads of state will actually engage and talk about
these things, is designed to see whether they can be greater than the
sum of their parts. And I think that\'s something that the United States
can play a role in, but the limits of that cooperation have yet to be
tested. Any sense why now was the moment for this new agreement? There
shouldn\'t be any question about why now. [It\'s because the United
States is not as - seen as reliable, as it has been in the past. We have
said for 70-plus years, an attack on any NATO state is an attack on all
NATO states. And even after the NATO summit, people don\'t believe that
Donald Trump is actually going to protect Europe in the face of Russian
aggression.]{.underline} And so there are two things going on. One,
[Britain and France want to make sure that they are deterring Russia.
But there\'s also a real acute concern that countries closer to Russia -
whether that\'s Poland or Finland or Turkey or elsewhere - may decide,
if we can\'t rely on the United States, maybe we need our own nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} And that\'s something that the United States,
Britain and France would all oppose, that would undermine our collective
security. [The more nuclear weapons states there are in the world, the
worse it is for everybody.]{.underline} And so I think [this is designed
to not only deter Russia but also to reassure other NATO allies so that
they don\'t have to pursue their own nuclear capabilities.]{.underline}
Lastly, you\'re talking about part of the equation here being relying
more Eastern European countries of, hey, you don\'t need to develop your
own nuclear weapons. At the end of the day, do you think this new
agreement between the U.K. and France is a step forward, a step backward
or kind of neutral when it comes to the overall nuclear security of the
globe and the prospect of ever having to use any of these weapons again?
Yeah, it\'s such a meta question, and\... It\'s what we go for. No, and
it\'s important. I mean, I\'ve been doing this almost 40 years, and
there\'s a duality around nuclear weapons, which, you know, has to be
talked about so people understand it. On the one hand, these are the
only weapons that human beings have created that can destroy all of
humanity, right? You go back to the Albert Einstein quote; we have to
abolish nuclear weapons before they abolish us. And so anytime you\'re
relying on the threat of nuclear weapons for your security, you\'re
playing a very dangerous game. We\'ve been very fortunate that for 80
years, since the end of World War II, these weapons haven\'t been used,
but they are more central, they are more relevant, and [many people
consider them more usable now than at any time in 50 years]{.underline}.
And so that\'s a concern. On the other hand, political commitments by
the United States, France, U.K., that we will use our nuclear weapons to
protect Europe or, in the case of the United States, to protect South
Korea, Japan, Australia and others, have been instrumental in keeping
the number of nuclear weapons states to a minimum. Right now, there are
nine countries that have nuclear weapons. [A world where you have 15 or
20 means that there are 15 or 20 fingers on the button. There are 15 or
20 nuclear arsenals that could potentially be subject to theft or
diversion or accidental escalation. And the more that risk grows, the
greater the nuclear danger.]{.underline} So if the - what the U.K. and
France have done helps convince U.S. allies that they shouldn\'t acquire
nuclear weapons, as long as that\'s not seen as an aggressive, coercive
threat to Russia and others, then I think it is a net positive.

Three decades later, that chasm has only widened. [What was once
heralded as the transatlantic alliance now resembles a **frayed
relationship**]{.underline}---full of historical baggage, misaligned
expectations, and growing estrangement. [The United States oscillates
between isolationism and **imperial overreach**]{.underline}, between
partnership and pressure. Europe, for its part, responds with
inertia---and a dangerous innocence.

But Baudrillard's point went deeper than geopolitical drift. What he
identified was a crisis of recognition: The more America and Europe
engage, the more distorted their reflections become. They speak the same
language of modernity but mean entirely different things. What
[Europeans interpret as a **universal project** grounded in
Enlightenment reason, Americans increasingly read through the lens of
**identity**, **loyalty**, and **power**]{.underline}.

Erosion of Enlightenment Ideals

[This is not merely cultural divergence; it marks a **philosophical
fracture**]{.underline}. The Enlightenment subject---autonomous through
reason (Immanuel Kant), morally responsible through judgment (Hannah
Arendt), and truth-seeking through discourse (Jürgen Habermas)---is
dissolving. [In the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
[it is increasingly being replaced by a tribalized model of **identity
politics**]{.underline} in which race, religion, and political
allegiance outweigh civic ideals. The result is not just fragmentation,
but the erosion of a shared public world.

One figure in this transformation is Leo Strauss, the German-Jewish
émigré whose critique of liberal relativism shaped generations of
American conservative thinkers. His disciples---many of whom influenced
the neoconservative turn under former US President George W.
Bush---called for a return to elite-led governance grounded in moral
clarity and power politics. Their legacy lives on in the moralizing,
anti-universalist impulses of today's American right. What began as an
esoteric intellectual project has morphed into a popular political
ideology that mistrusts diversity, devalues deliberation, and thrives on
conflict.

Europe, meanwhile, has clung to a post-national ideal. The European
Union, a project inspired by thinkers like Kant, Arendt, and Habermas,
imagines itself as a republic of states and citizens---a polity of
participation, not domination. This self-understanding contrasts sharply
with the American doctrine of "America First," and it reveals a deeper
civilizational split: Europe thinks in terms of the common good;
America, increasingly, in terms of property and sovereignty.

Yet this isn't just a transatlantic issue. The same struggle over the
meaning of democracy, identity, and power is playing out within the
United States itself. US President Donald Trump is not the origin of
this rupture; he is its most visible symptom. The real battle is
structural. On one side stands a coalition intent on concentrating
power---rejecting institutional constraints, seeking ideological
dominance, and modeling their ambitions on illiberal democracies from
Budapest to Moscow. On the other side are fragmented defenders of
constitutional order, civic pluralism, and liberal norms---similar in
spirit to European aspirations.

Seeking Political Hegemony

What makes this moment uniquely dangerous is the intensity of belief
that animates both sides. [The Trump-aligned camp believes the stakes
are **existential**]{.underline}---[that compromise means
**defeat**]{.underline}, and defeat means erasure. [They are not seeking
policy wins but **political hegemony**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the
defenders of liberal democracy have yet to formulate a compelling
counter-narrative that resonates as deeply with the public imagination.
Institutions alone are proving insufficient against a movement driven by
grievance, nostalgia, and a vision of retributive justice.

[If Trump believes that America's survival depended on his return to
power, compromise becomes **impossible**]{.underline}. [Politics becomes
**existential**]{.underline}. The traditional notion of divided
government and checks and balances gives way to zero-sum mobilization.
[This has consequences not just for **Americans**]{.underline}, [but for
their **allies**]{.underline}.

[Europe must recognize that it is witnessing]{.underline} not just a US
election cycle, [but a **systemic transformation**]{.underline}---and
one that is also echoing across its own backyard. What happens in
Washington will not remain in Washington. [The rollback of democratic
guardrails in the US would embolden **authoritarian
movements**]{.underline} [across Europe and weaken the **international
norms**]{.underline} that underpin liberal order.

[To pretend this is temporary, or **merely** **rhetorical**, is
naive]{.underline}. Baudrillard was right: This isn't "a gap"---or just
a political disagreement. It is a struggle over the meaning of
modernity, playing out on a global stage.

[Washington\'s approach **changed dramatically** with this week\'s
initial high-level talks between the **U.S**. and
**Russia**]{.underline} and took an even more ominous turn when [Trump,
without evidence, then **blamed Kyiv** for starting the war and
called]{.underline} Ukrainian President [Volodymyr **Zelenskiy**
a]{.underline} \"**[dictator]{.underline}** without elections.\"

The senior negotiators met in Riyadh on Tuesday just a month after
Donald Trump returned to the White House, [with **Ukraine** and **NATO**
partners **sidelined** by a relatively inexperienced team of **Trump**
aides and Putin granted concessions]{.underline} even before the talks
got under way.

[Trump\'s rush to impose an end to **Russia\'s war** in
**Ukraine**]{.underline} - and his seeming embrace of Kremlin talking
points - [has stoked fears of a peace deal with Putin that could
undermine Kyiv and **Europe\'s security**]{.underline} and alter the
geopolitical landscape.

\"The really worrying fact is that [Trump has taken Russia from pariah
to **prized partner**]{.underline} in the time span of just a few days.
That comes at a price,\" said Brett Bruen, a former foreign policy
adviser in the Obama administration.

Tuesday\'s talks, the first time the U.S. and Russia have met to discuss
the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, yielded agreement
to form negotiating teams for future meetings and to restore the normal
functioning of each other\'s diplomatic missions, reflecting a thawing
of long-frozen relations.

Even before the meeting, [European politicians accused Trump of handing
**free concessions** to Moscow last week by ruling out **NATO
membership** for **Ukraine**]{.underline} and saying it was an illusion
for Kyiv to believe it could win back the 20% of its territory now under
Russian control. Some critics condemned Trump for what they said
amounted to appeasement.

But [Trump went **even further**]{.underline} when he told reporters,
without explanation, [that Ukraine]{.underline} \"[should have **never
started**]{.underline}\" [the war]{.underline}, [which began with
Russia\'s 2022 full-scale invasion that the U.S. and other Western
nations said was **unprovoked**]{.underline}.

Then, on Wednesday, responding to Zelenskiy saying Trump was living in a
Russian disinformation bubble, the president cast doubt on Zelenskiy\'s
democratic credentials in a social media post, warning that he had
better secure a peace fast or he would have no country left.
Zelenskiy\'s elected term was supposed to end in 2024 but a vote has
been delayed by martial law imposed in response to Russia\'s invasion.

MAJOR PLAYERS EXCLUDED

[Ukraine\'s **exclusion** from Tuesday\'s meeting marked a **sharp
departure** from Biden and **NATO\'s mantra**]{.underline} of \"nothing
about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" Kyiv has said it will not accept any
deal imposed without its consent.

[And the absence of European representatives added to **U.S. allies\'
anxieties**]{.underline} about whether Trump might be willing to give up
too much for little from Putin.

That helped spur European governments to discuss the possibility of
contributing peacekeepers to back any deal on Ukraine. But Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would not accept NATO troops
in Ukraine.

There was no immediate sign that Russian officials had offered any
concessions in Tuesday\'s meeting.

The encounter saw Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov -
two veterans who have spent a combined 34 years in their current roles -
negotiate with three Trump aides in their first month on the job -
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and
Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.

\"The American team has almost no experience in high-level international
negotiation, no regional expertise on Ukraine and Russia, and no
relevant foreign language knowledge,\" Timothy Snyder, a Yale University
professor and Russia expert, wrote on X. \"Not true of the Russians, to
put it mildly.\"

Bruen described it as \"amateur hour\" for Trump\'s national security
apparatus.

A Trump administration official said Washington could not help foster a
lasting peace with the same lack of engagement that has allowed the
death and destruction in Ukraine to continue.

\"President Trump has built a strong team that is already demonstrating
his peace through strength agenda in action,\" said Brian Hughes,
spokesman for the White House National Security Council.

Trump said on Tuesday he was more confident after the talks and he would
probably meet with Putin before the end of the month. He has praised
Putin in the past and commended him for a conciliatory attitude after
their phone call last week.

Speaking to reporters in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump brushed aside
Ukraine\'s concern about being left out of the meeting and said Kyiv
should have entered talks much earlier.

Rubio said earlier that no one was being frozen out and any solution
must be acceptable to all parties. But there was no immediate word on
how Ukraine might be allowed to join.

Zelenskiy postponed a visit to Saudi Arabia planned for Wednesday
because of what sources familiar with the matter said was to avoid
giving \"legitimacy\" to the U.S.-Russia talks.

He drew the Trump administration\'s ire last weekend when he said a
draft minerals deal with Washington did not contain the security
provisions that Kyiv needed.

Three sources said the U.S. had proposed taking ownership of 50% of
Ukraine\'s critical minerals, apparently in compensation for vital U.S.
military aid, a demand some Trump critics have likened to extortion.

\'RUSSIA WON ROUND ONE\'

Emma Ashford, senior fellow at Stimson Center think tank in Washington,
said the Trump administration may have been justified in keeping the
talks limited for now.

\"It\'s certainly not ideal that Ukraine was not in the room, though I
believe they\'ll be at future such meetings,\" she said. \"But the
administration is probably right that including a variety of European
partners in the room might make for too many voices and make any
progress more difficult.\"

Still, Democrat Jake Auchincloss, who is a co-chair of the House of
Representatives\' Ukraine caucus, [said Russia had **won round
one**]{.underline}.

\"[The Kremlin has been **normalized** in bilateral diplomacy that
**excludes** Ukraine and **NATO**]{.underline} and they gave up nothing
to get that,\" he told Reuters.

One factor that has slowed the spread of [nuclear weapons]{.underline}

But, sadly, [it is getting easier to doubt the **U**nited **S**tates\'

war in their defense should they face attack from Russia or China?
Indeed, Trump has said that Russia can do \"whatever the hell they

defense. In this environment, [it is **hard to see** how U.S. allies and

US Secretary of Defense Pete [Hegseth arrived in Warsaw with sweet
nothings, calling Poland a]{.underline} "[model ally]{.underline}"
[while praising its defense spending and loyalty]{.underline}. But
beneath the flattery, the dynamic was familiar: **[Poland wants real
commitment while the US wants something much more casual]{.underline}**.

[This has been Poland's geopolitical problem, repeated **throughout
history**]{.underline} --- [its belief that loyalty, alliances, and
playing by the rules will guarantee security]{.underline}. In 1939,
Britain and France promised to stand by Poland against Germany. After
1989, [Poland bet everything on NATO and the EU as a permanent
shield]{.underline}. And today, [after pouring billions into defense,
hosting American troops, and backing Washington]{.underline} at every
turn, **[Poland is once again looking for certainty]{.underline}**. And
once again, [it's being breadcrumbed with reminders that in geopolitics,
**commitment is conditional**]{.underline}.

After a morning jog along Warsaw's riverfront with US Marines, [Hegseth
stopped short of ruling out a future reduction of NATO
forces]{.underline} in the region as part of potential negotiations with
Russia.

Asked at a press briefing with Poland's Defense Minister Władysław
Kosiniak-Kamysz whether US forces in Poland were there to stay,
[Hegseth]{.underline} deflected. He repeated the standard line about
American forces being a deterrent to Russia. But he also [warned that
the **future is uncertain**, that **nothing lasts
forever**]{.underline}, [and that Europe should prepare to take more
responsibility for its own security]{.underline}.

[For Poland, the lipstick perma-smile is **getting harder to maintain**.
It is one of NATO's biggest military spenders]{.underline}, dedicating
nearly 5% of its GDP to defense, far exceeding the alliance's 2%
benchmark. [It has]{.underline} invested billions in US weapons, from
F-35 fighter jets to Abrams tanks. It has hosted thousands of American
troops, built infrastructure to support them, and [done everything
possible to make itself indispensable to Washington]{.underline}.

Right now, around [10,000 US troops are stationed in Poland. A big
presence but **still rotational**. Unlike Germany, where American forces
have had a permanent base since the Cold War]{.underline}, Washington
has never given Poland the same status.

The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement ([EDCA]{.underline}), signed
in 2020, was supposed to be a milestone. It allowed the expansion of US
military infrastructure, including storage facilities, logistics hubs,
and training sites. But it [didn't offer a permanent base]{.underline}.
Instead, [it reinforced the idea that the US would **come and go as
needed**]{.underline}, [with Poland picking up]{.underline} much of [the
cost]{.underline}.

The centerpiece of this setup is Camp Kościuszko in Poznań, home to the
US Army's V Corps forward command. Officially, this is the nerve center
for US ground forces in Europe. In reality, it's a small command post,
not the full-scale headquarters Poland had hoped for. Then there's the
[Aegis Ashore]{.underline} missile defense site in Redzikowo,
operational since 2024. Poland points to it as proof of America's
long-term commitment. But the system [was built to counter threats from
Iran, not Russia]{.underline}.

Misplaced faith in agreements also defined Poland's approach to security
in 1939. It signed military alliances with Britain and France, believing
these would deter Hitler. When Germany invaded, Warsaw assumed its
allies would respond. But while Britain and France declared war, they
offered almost no real, practical help as Poland was overrun. Shortly
afterwards, the Soviet Union invaded from the east in coordination with
the Nazis and Poland's fate was sealed.

During the war, Winston Churchill spoke of Poland's sacrifices as a
"bank account of blood," a metaphorical ledger that would be honored
when Europe was reshaped. Poland made deposit after deposit on the
battlefield, believing it was securing its post-war future. But when it
came time to withdraw in 1945 at Yalta, the account was an illusion, and
Poland was handed over to Stalin.

Even after regaining its independence in 1989, Poland continued to
believe that integration into NATO and the EU would mean permanent
security. And for a time, it worked. Poland modernized its military,
became one of NATO's most reliable members, and followed EU directives
with near-religious discipline.

But [the rise of]{.underline} Donald [Trump a]{.underline}nd the
[shifting priorities of the US have made it clear that in the new world,
it is more blessed to give than to receive]{.underline}.

The lesson should be obvious by now. [Poland's mistake is not that it
tries to do everything right. It is that **it assumes this will be
enough**]{.underline}. But [in international politics, commitment is
never about fairness or loyalty. It is about power, leverage, and
interests. And when those interests shift, no amount of rule-following
can change the outcome]{.underline}."

Lavrov has a point. [One of the surest bets with Trump is on his

Lavrov's boss, Vladimir Putin. Every time Trump calls for a ceasefire,
Putin intensities Russia's missile and drone bombardment of Ukrainian
cities and infrastructure. It is almost as if Putin wants to rub salt
into Trump's wound. [Trump has **noticed this**]{.underline}. "My
conversations with him are very pleasant, and then the missiles go off
at night," Trump said of Putin. Should this turn into a game of chicken,
I would still put my money on Putin.

[We should not **invest much stock** in Trump's threat to impose **steep

**sanctions bill** that Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican

Both in public and private, Trump and his key political appointees have
clearly stated that Europe is not a priority, expressed disdain for
Europe's political order, and raised doubts about their commitment to
the continent's security. However, [members of the Trump administration
have repeatedly signaled to the Europeans]{.underline} that [the nuclear
dimension **remains unaffected** by other transatlantic
quarrels]{.underline}. In fact, [the administration has offered
**numerous assurances**]{.underline} that [the U.S. nuclear umbrella
would remain in place for the long term]{.underline}. The U.S.
Department of Defense's Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance,
which was leaked to the press in March, stated that the United States
would continue to support Europe with nuclear deterrence of Russia, even
if Washington would count on the Europeans to take on various other
conventional roles.

The administration's [conventional force posture]{.underline} also
[offers]{.underline} some [reason for **cautious optimism**. For many
allies, the credibility of extended nuclear deterrence is tied
to]{.underline} the presence of substantial U.S. [conventional
forces]{.underline} in Europe. The U.S. Department of Defense has
signaled an intention to reassess the U.S. presence on the continent,
and the posture review is still underway. And it is possible that
decisions to reduce the U.S. presence in Europe might be only taken
after the NATO summit, once all key positions in the Pentagon have been
staffed and the posture review has been concluded. Then again,
[indications are]{.underline} that the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [will reduce some presence, such as the additional troops
deployed after 2022, but **not fundamentally alter its conventional
footprint in Europe**]{.underline}---which can be read as [an indicator
of U.S. willingness to continue]{.underline} to provide [extended
deterrence. While the alliance is increasingly transferring
responsibility to Europe]{.underline}---clearly posing difficult
adaptation challenges---**[the core U.S.-led military structure appears
largely intact]{.underline}**.

Of course, a Russian war of aggression with a clear nuclear dimension on
NATO's border is a fundamentally new phenomenon, and some European
allies fear that, combined with the new U.S. administration's disruptive
goals, these new circumstances might fundamentally alter the
transatlantic alliance. However, [the current situation is]{.underline}
actually [**comparable to earlier transatlantic disagreements** that did
not result in the collapse of extended nuclear deterrence. Severe
economic disputes have **often occurred**]{.underline} throughout the
past eight decades. [Political disputes were common]{.underline};
several allies were autocracies for extended periods. [Capitals on both
sides]{.underline} of the Atlantic **[repeatedly colluded with
Moscow]{.underline}**, much to their allies' dismay.

Lastly, [most Europeans believe that, even under the most restrictive
interpretation of Trump's interests, abandoning extended nuclear
deterrence toward the continent would be **inconsistent**
with]{.underline} achieving [the president's goals, including
maintaining a sufficiently stable international economic order
for]{.underline} the administration to achieve [its domestic
aims]{.underline}. It is undeniable that Trump and many of his
associates aim to fundamentally reshape the international system.
However, they do not appear entirely indifferent to domestic
constraints. This assessment is supported by the administration's
retreat from its maximalist positions when confronted with substantial
economic costs. Also, [the Trump administration's current approach to
NATO seems to suggest]{.underline} that [the U.S.]{.underline}
government [remains **committed to its security assurances** and
**recognizes the strategic importance of allies**]{.underline}. While
U.S. officials may believe that limited conventional crises in Europe
could be regional responsibilities, [massive realignments and the chaos
associated with the collapse of nuclear deterrence can hardly be in the
interest of any U.S. administration]{.underline}. Moreover, [Washington
appears determined to limit Beijing's economic and military options. A
stable, cooperative Europe is **essential to**]{.underline} achieving
**[this]{.underline}** goal, while a collapsing transatlantic
relationship could severely limit U.S. options.

All this means that [the so-called]{.underline}
"**[Eurobomb]{.underline}**," "Eurodeterrent," or "Euronukes" [debate
is]{.underline}---in the words of Bruno Tertrais---still [a **red
herring**. A European nuclear deterrent is]{.underline} not only
**[unlikely]{.underline}**, it is also unnecessary---for two reasons.

First, [the U.S. nuclear umbrella is **more robust than Trump's comments
make it seem**]{.underline}. In the 1960s the British defense minister
Denis Healey said, "it takes only 5% credibility of American retaliation
to deter the Russians, but 95% to reassure the Europeans." Healey's
Theorem, as it became known, is often invoked around the challenges of
assuring allies about U.S. extended nuclear deterrence commitments. But
it also highlights that **[deterrence rests on
uncertainty]{.underline}**, not certainty. As an Estonian analyst
explained in the Wall Street Journal: "[For Putin, what really matters
is that the other side that]{.underline} opposes him [has nuclear
weapons and is credible about their use in extreme circumstances. As
long as there still is this 1% chance]{.underline} of the nuclear
element, the [deterrence may still hold]{.underline}."

[Despite]{.underline} the former president's [loose
language]{.underline}---[and **even if he took a more cavalier
position**]{.underline} if he returned to office---the [United States'
adversaries can never be certain]{.underline} that [he would rule out
nuclear use in]{.underline} "[extreme circumstances]{.underline}."
Moreover, **[despite his acerbic rhetoric]{.underline}** about NATO
allies during his four years in office, President **[Trump's
policies]{.underline}**---such as the 2018 Nuclear Posture
Review---**[amounted to a strengthening, not weakening, of the U.S.
nuclear enterprise]{.underline}** and extended deterrence. **[Actions
speak louder than words]{.underline}**.

The second reason Europe does not need a nuclear deterrent is because it
already has two. [The **U**nited **K**ingdom and France both extend
their nuclear deterrents to Europe]{.underline}. [The **U**nited
**K**ingdom does so through NATO]{.underline}, officially declaring: "We
would consider using our nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances
of self-defence, including the defence of our NATO allies." While
[France]{.underline} does not participate in NATO's nuclear planning or
declare its deterrent to NATO, it [has made clear that its nuclear
arsenal is at the service of European security]{.underline}. As
President Macron stated in 2020 (and reiterated in April): "Let's be
clear: France's vital interests now have a European dimension." (Macron
followed the example of de Gaulle and Pompidou, who made a similar
declaration in 1964, and several leaders since.) Moreover, since 1995
France and the United Kingdom have treated their vital interests as
concomitant.

[The British and French nuclear arsenals]{.underline} are much smaller
than that of the United States---consisting of a few hundred warheads
rather than a few thousand---but [are large enough to inflict
unacceptable damage. These two]{.underline} European arsenals [enhance
the]{.underline} political [credibility of NATO's deterrent by making
the perennial question of whether any U.S. president would]{.underline}
"[trade New York for Paris]{.underline}" **[less
relevant]{.underline}**.

take \[the United States\] to realise that nothing will change with
\[...\] Russia?' (The Guardian, 2010). Despite the White House's promise
to modernise Polish forces and provide them with Patriot missile
batteries, Polish concerns remain unappeased.

Then, in 2011, Barack Obama announced his Pivot to Asia strategy,
revealing a shift in focus from Europe and its rivalry with Russia to
the Indo-Pacific and its competition with China. With this shift, the
Obama administration expected European partners to shoulder greater
responsibility in addressing security issues on the continent;
consequently raising fear of US abandonment in Polish elites circles.
These concerns were confirmed when the 44th president showed reluctance
to severely sanction against Russia after its 2014 aggression against
Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. [The lack of US leadership in
responding to threats posed by]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin
indicated]{.underline} that [US retrenchment]{.underline} had already
[impacted US influence in Eastern Europe]{.underline} (Zajac, 2016).
According to Poland's former Minister of Foreign Affairs Adam Rotfeld,
US policy in Europe since 2009 was a massive failure as it facilitated
Russian expansionism, which the Obama administration failed to halt, and
it suggested that NATO was not as strong as it was (Shuster, 2014).

Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** further **[increased Poland's
restlessness]{.underline}**. His [repeated remarks about NATO being
costly and obsolete intensified Poland's concerns about US indifference
towards European security. Warsaw]{.underline} also [grew **fearful of a
potential rapprochement between Trump and Putin** due to the president's
transactional approach to world politics and his perception
of]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin as]{.underline} a [strong]{.underline}
leader. To Poland, this signalled Trump's attempt to prevent the
formation of a Sino-Russian bloc, which would have been done at the
expense of Poland and other European allies' security (Lanoszka, 2020).
[Poland **seriously questioned** Trump's ability to fully grasp Russia's
potential threats]{.underline}.

This [fear of US hegemonic restraint came]{.underline} at a time [when
Russia was increasingly perceived]{.underline} by Poland [as a
significant threat]{.underline}. While the Polish government had
accessed that an opened conflict with Russia was 'only slight' in the
early 2000s (Ministry of National Defence, 2003 p.2), Poland's strategic
landscape underwent a radical transformation in the late 2000s. The 2008
Russo-Georgian War and the largest Russian military exercises con-
ducted at Poland's border in 2009, led Warsaw to conclude having
underestimated the threats posed by Moscow. The annexation of Crimea in
2014 and the war that Moscow man- ufactured in the Donbas region only
served to confirm this analysis. In its 2017 update of its Defence
Concept, the Ministry of Defence acknowledged that 'the scale of threats
resulting from the Russian aggressive policy had not been adequately
assessed in the past,' and '\[t\]his resulted in a wrong conviction that
the risk of an armed conflict in our part of Europe was marginal'
(Ministry of National Defence, 2017, p. 6).

Internal balancing for attractiveness

[Abandonment anxiety and Russia's threat led Poland to make
**substantial investments** in defence]{.underline} throughout the
2010s. Poland's defence budget grew by 86% from 2009 to 2021 to reach 15
billion US dollars (SIPRI, 2023b). The Polish parliament passed a law
mandating the allocation of at least 2% of GDP annually for defence
financing starting in 2016, with a minimum of 20% of this budget
dedicated to modernisation efforts (Zajac, 2016, p. 155). The Polish
government aimed to achieve a defence expenditure of 2.5% of GDP by
2030. Additionally, the [Polish]{.underline} armed forces underwent a
significant transformation with the implementation of the 'Komorowski
Doctrine' in 2015. This [doctrine aimed to modernice and refocus the
Polish armed forces, with a particular emphasis on territorial defence
against Russian threats]{.underline}.

In parallel, [Warsaw **strained** to enlarge the US military footprint
in Poland. It requested greater US military presence]{.underline} on
NATO's eastern flank and expressed interest in a permanent US military
presence within the country. At the 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO members
agreed first the first time to deploy military forces to eastern Poland.
This included the stationing of a rotational force of 3,000 soldiers and
the deployment of about 1,000 US troops as part of a US-led NATO
enhanced Forward Presence Battlegroup (Emmott & Siebold, 2016). [By
beefing up]{.underline} its [internal defence]{.underline} capabilities
[with American equipment, Warsaw **sought to demonstrate its
credibility** as a reliable ally deserving protection]{.underline}.
Shortly after the Summit, Warsaw dramatically cancelled a \$3 billion
agreement to buy 50 Airbus transport helicopters and instead purchased
US-made Sikorsky helicopters. This not only demonstrated Warsaw
commitment to closer ties with Washington but also garnered increased
support for its request for a greater NATO presence on the alliance's
eastern border (Reuters, 2016b).

Furthermore, and similar to Japan, [Poland's attractiveness strategy was
acute under the Trump presidency]{.underline}. Polish President [Duda
remained **staunchly pro-American and pro-Trump**. Duda even supported
Trump's criticism of the **E**uropean **U**nion, as]{.underline} the
[Polish]{.underline} government's [relations with Brussels faltered
over]{.underline} the issue of [democratic decline]{.underline}
(Montgomery, 2020). In 2018, President Andrzej [Duda]{.underline} even
[chose to play on Trump's narcissism by **proposing**]{.underline} to
finance a permanent base named '**[Fort Trump]{.underline}**' to curry
favour with the US president (Hennigan, 2019). The Polish government
offered to contribute up to US\$2 billion for its construction.
[This]{.underline} proposal, following the dramatic cancellation of the
Airbus helicopters, [exemplified the]{.underline} type of [**internal
balancing for attractiveness** pursued by the Polish government towards
its security patron]{.underline}. Although the project was later
abandoned due to financial and strategic reasons, [Warsaw]{.underline}
nevertheless [convinced Washington to dispatch additional
troops]{.underline} to its territory. In a new bilateral defence
cooperation agreement, the Trump administration formalised its
intentions to provide Poland with additional defence and deterrence
capabilities. The military presence in Poland reached approximately
4,500 rotational US military personnel, with an additional 1,000
military personnel to be added (President of the Republic of Poland,
2019). Shortly after the joint declaration, Poland signed a \$4.6
billion deal with the United States to acquire 32 F-35A Lightning II
fighter jets. The deal included training, logistics, and simulators.
Warsaw also acquired almost a dozen Patriot system batteries. This
agreement was a sign of the strong relationship between Poland and the
United States, and it further strengthened the relationship between the
two countries.

In 2019, Poland went further by launching two Technical Modernisation
Plans with the objective of investing \$133 billion until 2035 in the
acquisition of fifth-generation US combat aircraft, unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), helicopters, short-range rockets, sub- marines, and
cybersecurity. With these plans and previous US military purchased, the
United States became by far Poland's primary military supplier
(Lesiecki, 2019; SIPRI, 2023a; Szopa, 2019). During a 2019 meeting of
NATO defence ministers, Mariusz Błaszczak, the Polish Defence Minister,
summarised the country's strategic stance, stating, 'We assume
solidarity. We are active, which implies that our partners also support
us' (Ministry of National Defence, 2019).

Warsaw's little interest in strategic diversification

Throughout the 2010s, [Warsaw entrusted its security protection to its
most important ally, the United States. **Poland viewed the U**nited
**S**tates **as its only viable partner**, which explains why Warsaw did
not invest]{.underline} more [in strategic diversification.
**Every**]{.underline} foreign and defence [**white paper** emphasised
the **central role of the US**]{.underline} in Poland's security.
Kwiatkowska et al. (2022) show, for instance, that Polish parliamentary
discourses consistently emphasised the importance of the United States,
especially in 2008 and then in 2013- 2014, when Polish political leaders
sought ways to ensure US security in light of Russia's threats.

[Polish leaders did not view the EU as a reliable security
option]{.underline}. As Alexander Lanoszka puts it, '\[o\]f course, [the
EU is not a military organisation]{.underline}, but that is the point.
[**Military power is seen as the bedrock for Polish security**, rather
than values and commerce]{.underline} per se, important as they are'
(2020, p. 463). In fact, throughout the 2010s, Polish leaders feared a
split between their country's interests and those of other EU members.
While Poland focused on military security, Western European countries
concentrated on non- military aspects such as immigration, climate
change, and economic crises (Zajac, 2016, p.138).

Two trends emerged from Poland's strategic thinking. First, [Polish
leaders feared that **any alternative security arrangements**
could]{.underline} potentially [undermine US commitment to Poland's
security. This is why]{.underline} the concept of Europe's [strategic
autonomy]{.underline}, as emphasised by French President Emmanuel
Macron, [raised concerns in Poland. Such a project could upset
Washington, weaken US military engagement in Europe, and prove
detrimental to Poland's interests and security]{.underline}
(ThefirstNews, 2021; Zandee et al., 2020). More generally, [Polish
leaders suspected]{.underline} that [EU security policy and European
members' initiatives would **enable the US to shift** its focus more
towards China and less towards Russia]{.underline}.

Second, [Poland aimed to]{.underline} strengthen European security
institutions and cooperation mainly to **[keep the US
engaged]{.underline}** in regional security. This was [exemplified by
the proposal to cooperate with the US within]{.underline} the EU's
Permanent Structured Cooperation ([PESCO]{.underline}). This strategy of
[institutional binding was]{.underline} essentially [a variation on the
same theme: **ensuring**]{.underline} that [**the U**nited **S**tates
**would continue to be militarily involved** in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. In this context, Polish leaders also sought to
enhance regional cooperation, particularly with the Visegrad Group
(Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia) and the Baltic states, with the
broader objective of strengthening NATO's Eastern Flank (Ministry of
National Defense, 2017). Poland also perceived EU defence initiatives
such as the European Defence Fund and PESCO as a means to bolster NATO
through European cooperation.

In conclusion, [while Poland heavily invested in internal balancing for
attractiveness, it did not]{.underline} significantly [strengthen its
military ties to the EU. **Warsaw held the belief that instead of
mitigating the effects of U.S. retrenchment, strategic diversification
would**]{.underline} actually **[exacerbate it]{.underline}**. As a
result[, Polish leaders exercised extreme caution by selectively opting
for security initiatives aimed **solely** at strengthening their
security ties with Washington and **keeping their ally more engaged** in
the region]{.underline}.

[The pro-Russia turn on the part of the US government has]{.underline}
thus [not necessarily persuaded all Poles to feel negatively about
Trump]{.underline}. Rather, [Trump's tough course on Ukraine has
encouraged the right-wing]{.underline} electorate and politicians [to
develop a new approach which is both **pro-American and
anti-Ukrainian**]{.underline}---a novelty in the Polish discourse. For
example, [they blame]{.underline} Ukrainian President Volodymyr
[Zelensky for his]{.underline} alleged "[misbehavior]{.underline}" [in
the Oval Office and defend Trump against criticism]{.underline}; like
the US president, they expect more "gratitude" from Ukraine.

[A well-known **anti-Western-European sentiment** is responsible for
part of this]{.underline} narrative. Former PiS Prime Minister Mateusz
Morawiecki wrote in response to JD Vance's speech to the Munich Security
Conference: "I have no doubt that Western Europe will sacrifice Poland
if necessary." He added: "[When it comes to negotiating the fate of
Central Europe, we could become an appetizer on the menu of Berlin,
Brussels, and Paris]{.underline}."

[Trump's policies]{.underline}, therefore, [are not only challenging
Poland's security policy fundamentals, but also the **long-standing
consensus on Atlanticism**]{.underline} that used to unite the country
beyond party political differences. [Trump may have unified Europeans
around]{.underline} the purpose of a [common defense. But the
centrifugal forces he has unleashed in European societies may prove to
be no less consequential than the **collapse of the US security
guarantee**]{.underline}.

"I am glad to be in Vilnius today," said German Chancellor Friedrich
Merz on May 22. "Because it is right here, [in Lithuania]{.underline},
where [we are taking the defense of NATO's eastern flank **into our own
hands**]{.underline}."

Merz was in Vilnius to formally inaugurate the 45th Armored Brigade in
Lithuania, which will embed German combat power at the heart of Baltic
defense. Germany will implement a phased deployment---it sent advanced
elements in early 2024 and formally activated the brigade on April 1.
The brigade is expected to reach full combat readiness by 2027. Once
complete, this will offer Lithuania and its neighbors a sustained,
high-end deterrent anchored in the NATO framework.

But [it's not just Germany that is helping bolster the defenses of
NATO's]{.underline} strategically exposed [eastern flank. The eastern
flank countries themselves are implementing **concrete measures** to
overcome Europe's entrenched defense fragmentation. Finland, Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland]{.underline}---all located along the
eastern border of both NATO and the European Union (EU) with mainland
Russia, its Kaliningrad exclave, and Belarus---[are emerging as
**leaders in bolstering regional defense integration**]{.underline}, the
benefits of which could extend throughout Europe. [This]{.underline}
shift [is especially significant amid **growing transatlantic tensions**
and **renewed calls from the U**nited **S**tates **for Europe to assume
greater responsibility** for its own security]{.underline} and
conventional defense.

[Since]{.underline} Russia's full-scale invasion of [Ukraine, these
countries have aligned]{.underline} their [border protection
efforts]{.underline} by integrating their counter-mobility measures.
They have [initiated the process of cooperatively developing deep-strike
capabilities]{.underline}. They have [also started the procurement
process for German weapon systems]{.underline}, introduced the German
defense industry to the region, and will soon host the first-ever
permanently deployed German brigade. All [these initiatives
show]{.underline} that [Europe's defense efforts are **well-positioned
to grow together** and **consolidate** from the epicenter in the
northeast of the continent]{.underline}. By anchoring their defense
planning in regional realities, [the eastern flank countries are
demonstrating that regional coordination, backed by political
determination, can **transform**]{.underline} exposed **[vulnerabilities
into strategic assets]{.underline}** [that enhance deterrence and
operational readiness]{.underline}.

[Faced with growing]{.underline} geostrategic [pressure along their
borders with Russia and Belarus, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
and Poland have taken **decisive, coordinated steps** to reinforce
border protection and defense]{.underline}. Increasingly aligned in
their strategic approach, these countries are developing integrated
fortification systems that form a continuous defensive line along the
eastern border of NATO and the EU.

[Two major initiatives]{.underline} launched in 2024---[the Baltic
Defense Line]{.underline} covering Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, [and
Poland's East Shield]{.underline}---[share the common goal of
strengthening deterrence and denying adversaries access to NATO and EU
territory]{.underline}. These efforts include expanding existing
forested areas, deepening drainage ditches, building engineering depots
to store physical barriers such as "dragons' teeth," "hedgehogs,"
"Spanish horse," and solid concrete road barriers, as well as installing
anti-tank landmines and mine-laying equipment. [There are]{.underline}
also [plans for developing reinforcements with drone and anti-drone
technologies]{.underline}. The overall goal is [to ensure the two
defense initiatives' integrity]{.underline}, especially [as they
converge at the Suwałki Gap, a security chokepoint and the primary axis
for NATO's land reinforcement to the Baltic states]{.underline}.

Finland's accession to NATO added 1,340 kilometers to the Alliance's
border with Russia. Unlike the more exposed terrain of the Baltic states
and Poland, Finland's border region is naturally defensive, dominated by
forests, lakes, and wetlands, which would complicate a large-scale
Russian ground incursion. Accordingly, Finland has chosen not to build
physical fortifications along the border.

However, [to reinforce deterrence and secure vulnerable segments,
Finland aligned itself with]{.underline} the [regional consensus by
withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention]{.underline} banning the use of
anti-personnel landmines. This means the [eastern flank countries can
jointly deploy and stockpile anti-personnel landmines as a shared border
defense tool against Russia]{.underline}. Both Russia and Ukraine have
used anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine.

The [regional integration of border defense has triggered **broader EU
interest**. Following Baltic and Polish calls for a collective response,
the European Council's conclusions on European defense]{.underline},
released on March 6, [recognized the importance of EU border
defense]{.underline}. The EU's White Paper on Defense, published in late
March, endorsed the idea of creating an "Eastern Border Shield" and in
April, the European Parliament passed a resolution recognizing the East
Shield and the Baltic Defense Line as flagship projects for common
security. This momentum must now translate into concrete EU
support---and funding---for transforming the eastern flank countries'
national efforts into a unified, layered European border defense
architecture.

#### Deep strike. 

Justina **Budginaite-Froehly 25**, Nonresident Senior Fellow in the
Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council,
Ph.D. from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, "How NATO's
eastern flank is setting the standard for collective defense," Atlantic

DG

[The Baltic states, Poland, and Finland are]{.underline} also
[integrating]{.underline} their [long-range firepower into a **regional
deep-strike architecture**, which **significantly raises the threshold
for aggression** along the eastern flank of NATO and the
EU]{.underline}.

[Since]{.underline} Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine
in [2022, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania]{.underline} have each
[contracted]{.underline} High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems
([HIMARS]{.underline}) [launchers and committed to trilateral
**coop**eration with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} on HIMARS
integration, personnel training, system maintenance, and service.
Embedding [HIMARS]{.underline} into a joint operational concept [will
allow the Baltic states to conduct combined live-fire exercises and
harmonize sustainment]{.underline} through shared maintenance, training,
and logistics chains. Estonia's six launchers, delivered in April, now
reach well beyond four hundred kilometers. Lithuania's eight launchers,
due to arrive by 2026, will achieve a similar reach. Latvia is set to
receive six launchers in 2027, which will complete the Baltic
deep-strike firewall.

[This Baltic cluster is dovetailing with Poland']{.underline}s even
larger "[Homar-A]{.underline}" [deep-strike program]{.underline}, under
which some 486 additional HIMARS variants will be mounted on Polish
Jelcz trucks and integrated into Poland's Topaz command system.
Together, [Poland and the Baltic states are planning a joint logistics
hub to manage munitions stockpiles, spare parts, and forward
displacement]{.underline}. They are also planning to exercise joint
targeting and coordinate fire support across borders.

[Finland]{.underline} has [opted to upgrade its]{.underline} M270
[multiple-launch rocket systems]{.underline} rather than buy HIMARS. The
upgrade, approved in 2023, allows Finnish M270s to fire the same
munitions as their Baltic neighbors. This technical alignment transforms
Finland's forces into a seamless fourth pillar of the regional
deep-strike ensemble, enabling integrated planning, data‐sharing, and
cross-border reinforcement exercises.

By integrating US-provided launchers, coordinated doctrine, shared
logistics, and interoperable fire-control standards, [the five eastern
flank nations are establishing a continuous, multi-tiered long-range
fire network that **spans from Finland to Poland**. This]{.underline}
network [helps project deterrence and complicate adversary planning,
**solidifying**]{.underline} a new level of [**collective defense
integration** on the eastern flank]{.underline}.

#### German defense partnerships. 

Justina **Budginaite-Froehly 25**, Nonresident Senior Fellow in the

DG

[The eastern flank countries]{.underline} have also [deepened their
partnerships with German weapon manufacturers. Lithuania is aligning its
force modernization with the German brigade's forward posture in the
Baltics]{.underline}. In December, Lithuania's defense ministry signed a
€950 million contract with for forty-four Leopard 2 A8 main battle
tanks---its first indigenous tank battalion---which will arrive through
2030, alongside an expanded fleet of twenty-seven additional Boxer
"Vilkas" infantry fighting vehicles, which will arrive by 2029. [Finland
and Poland]{.underline} likewise [use Leopard 2 variants, creating a
shared main battle tank backbone]{.underline} across the eastern flank.

In the air defense domain, [Estonia and Latvia will each field three
IRIS-T surface-launched missile batteries this year]{.underline}, while
[Lithuania has bolstered its]{.underline} two national advanced
surface-to-air missile systems ([NASAMS]{.underline})
[batteries]{.underline} (initially deployed in 2020) [with additional
systems due to arrive in 2026]{.underline}. To underpin sustained
operations, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall's new NATO-standard 155
mm ammunition plant in Lithuania, scheduled to be online by mid-2026,
will produce tens of thousands of shells annually, significantly
enhancing regional munitions resilience.

In the defense innovation field, [Lithuanian laser technology firm
Aktyvus Photonics has partnered with German drone manufacturer Quantum
Systems]{.underline}, having signed a memorandum of understanding on
strategic collaboration in unmanned systems this month. Together, they
will codevelop and field-test unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with
laser capabilities, aiming to expedite deployment timelines and
establish a standard for next-generation, networked unmanned systems in
NATO's eastern defenses.

[Beyond procurement, production, and innovation, Lithuania]{.underline}
has also [positioned itself as a **regional arms maintenance hub**:
Through the establishment of Lithuania Defense Services]{.underline}---a
joint venture between Rheinmetall Landsysteme and French-German defense
manufacturer KNDS---[it provides repair, overhaul, and upgrade services
for German vehicle platforms]{.underline}, including Boxer Vilkas IFVs,
PzH 2000 howitzers, [the Leopard main battle tank family, and tactical
logistics vehicles]{.underline}.

Collectively, [these deployments, procurements, and industrial
partnerships do more than fill capability gaps: They forge a
**contiguous eastern flank defense ecosystem**. By standardizing on
German platforms, harmonizing training and logistics, co-locating
production and repair facilities, and co-training under unified command
structures, Finland, the Baltic states, and Poland, together with
Germany, can achieve **unprecedented interoperability and strategic
depth**. These initiatives are transforming NATO's eastern flank into a
**seamless, multi-domain bulwark**]{.underline}.

Strategic depth through regional alignment

[The eastern flank's transformation from]{.underline} a collection of
[fragmented national postures into a cohesive, multi-domain defense
network exemplifies how sustained regional integration can **overcome
long-standing capability gaps**]{.underline}. By aligning border
defense, harmonizing long-range fires, and embedding German heavy armor
and sustainment infrastructure, [Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
and Poland are creating a **continuous belt of deterrence** that
leverages shared doctrine, logistics, and industry. This]{.underline}
holistic approach [raises the cost of aggression and sets a new standard
for European collective defense]{.underline}: one [where
interoperability and joint capacity-building replace duplication and
dependency, anchoring strategic depth at NATO's most exposed
frontier]{.underline}.

### No Link\-\--AT: Cred Theory\-\--2AC

#### Credibility theory is [wrong]{.underline}\-\--perception of U.S. commitment differs among allies.

Our findings support conditional credibility arguments. [Alliance
credibility is]{.underline} strongly correlated among close allies, but
**[weakly correlated across regions]{.underline}**. This implies that
alliance credibility is interdependent, but not across all alliances.

Therefore, [there is little evidence for the strongest claims about
interdependent or independent alliance credibility. We find **little
evidence** of]{.underline} that [meaningful correlations in credibility
span regions]{.underline}. As a result, [upholding credibility in one
region **will have at best a marginal relationship with credibility in
more distant alliances**]{.underline}. But [allies that are close to one
another do exhibit meaningful correlations]{.underline}, so reduced
credibility in one treaty could undermine others. The results likewise
provide further evidence on the importance of regions as a distinctive
level of analysis in international relations (Buzan and Wæver 2003).

The results have policy implications as well. [Policymakers]{.underline}
who are [considering reducing alliance commitments can expect that lost
credibility in one treaty will have the **greatest impact on proximate
partners**]{.underline}. But **[downgrading U.S. commitments in one
region might not cause perceived credibility in other regions to
decline]{.underline}**. The [results]{.underline} thus
[suggest]{.underline} there is [reason to be optimistic that
prioritizing alliance commitments in one region over another will not
come at the expense of a tarnished reputation elsewhere. To the extent
that opposition to retrenchment and support for]{.underline}
strengthening or maintaining [the status quo in U.S. alliances draw on
concern]{.underline} that [allies make inferences about American
credibility across regions, our findings suggest **this concern may be
misplaced**]{.underline}.

#### Cred theory is [historically]{.underline} and [academically]{.underline} bankrupt.

Stephen M. **Walt 22**, Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of
International Affairs at Harvard University, Ph.D. in Political Science

Obsession With Credibility," Foreign Policy, 01-29-2022,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/29/us-credibility-ukraine-russia-grand-strategy

As many observers have commented, [the most predictable feature of any
debate about U.S. foreign policy is the ritual **invoking**
of]{.underline} "**[credibility]{.underline}**." Whether the issue is
Ukraine, Iran, Russia, Taiwan, Afghanistan, the global war on terror, or
even trade policy, sooner or later someone is going to argue that
failing to implement their preferred policy will do grievous harm to the
United States' reputation for resolve.

Why is the United States so obsessed with this aspect of foreign policy?
Is it an artifact of its political culture, a result of how
international relations is taught in universities, or an odd quirk of
America's national history? Is it merely a handy refuge for hard-liners
trying to justify actions that can't be defended on other grounds or
just a persistent mind-worm that the foreign-policy elite can't get
past? Or is it perhaps the direct consequence of U.S. grand strategy
itself?

Whatever the reason, [I can't think of another great power as
concerned]{.underline} with preserving its own credibility [as the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} has been for many years. Don't get me
wrong: I'm not saying the United States is the only country that worries
about its reputation for resolve, nor am I suggesting that being
perceived as credible isn't valuable when dealing with friends and foes
alike. Since World War II, however, [the idea that a failure to respond
to and decisively defeat any challenge would have baleful
consequences]{.underline} for the United States [has been a central
theme]{.underline} of U.S. foreign-policy discourse. It is the key
ingredient in the infamous Munich analogy---surely the most moth-eaten
trope in the foreign-policy elite's toolkit---but also central to the
so-called domino theory and recurring fear that any sign of weakness
would lead allies to abandon the United States and bandwagon to its
foes.

In 1968, for example, then-incoming U.S. National Security Advisor Henry
Kissinger insisted that the United States had to fight on in Vietnam,
even though he had apparently believed the United States could not hope
to win the war. Why? Because he believed U.S. credibility was
all-important: In his words, "nations can gear their actions to ours
only if they can count on our steadiness."

Failing to respond when states act contrary to U.S. wishes supposedly
invites further predations, which is why [some observers of]{.underline}
former U.S. President Barack [Obama's]{.underline} [decision not to
retaliate after]{.underline} Syrian President Bashar [al-Assad used
chemical weapons encouraged]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} to seize Crimea in 2014, [even though direct
evidence of a link is **lacking**]{.underline} and [Putin might well
have acted **no matter what Obama did**]{.underline}. Today, former U.S.
officials claim that failing to respond with force to a Russian attack
on Ukraine will invite a Chinese attack on Taiwan and "set the global
system back decades," said retired U.S. Navy Adm. James Stavridis to the
New York Times.

[For the credibility-obsessed]{.underline}, in short, **[everything is
connected to everything]{.underline}** else, and [even fairly minor
events]{.underline} in one part of the world can [have enormous
repercussions **thousands of miles away**]{.underline}. Take this logic
far enough and the credibility of U.S. commitments becomes the single
most important source of peace and order in the world. Historian Hal
Brands, U.S. diplomat Eric Edelman, and author Thomas Mahnken express
this hard-line view perfectly:

"If America's credibility is strong, then adversaries will be deterred,
allies will be reassured, and relative geopolitical stability will
prevail. If American credibility is weak, then adversaries will be
emboldened, allies will be unnerved, and geopolitical revisionism and
aggression will proliferate. Opportunistic powers will gradually become
more assertive on the theory that their aggression will not be punished;
the international system will veer toward greater conflict and upheaval.
... \[I\]t is the very foundation of international peace and stability."

[This]{.underline} rather **[self-centered view]{.underline}** of world
affairs conveniently [ignores]{.underline} those [episodes where it was
the **U**nited **S**tates that acted to disrupt]{.underline}
"international [peace]{.underline} and stability," but never mind that
for now. [If the credibility of U.S. promises is the key]{.underline} to
world peace, [one wonders why the world didn't come unglued after the
United States **lost in Vietnam**, after **No**rth **Ko**rea got away
with **seizing the USS Pueblo**]{.underline} and holding its crew
prisoner for almost a year, [after the Shah of Iran fell and the U.S.
**Embassy in Tehran was captured**, after the Reagan administration's
hasty **withdrawal from Lebanon**]{.underline} in 1984,
[after]{.underline} the **[Black Hawk Down]{.underline}** debacle in
Somalia, [or after]{.underline} former U.S. President Bill [Clinton
opted not to intervene in the **Rwanda**n genocide]{.underline}. Maybe
U.S. credibility is neither as fragile nor as essential as hard-liners
think.

More importantly, [this view assumes]{.underline} that [security
guarantees]{.underline}---in particular, guarantees issued by the United
States---[are the main ingredient in global peace, leaving]{.underline}
little or [no role for negotiation, compromise, reassurance, or **other
diplomatic efforts**]{.underline} to give potential rivals less reason
to challenge the status quo. It is also worth noting that the [positive
effects of]{.underline} a successful defense of [credibility
**never**]{.underline} seem to **[last]{.underline}** very long: [No
matter what the **U**nited **S**tates did the last time]{.underline} it
was challenged, it [has to respond as soon as a new problem
emerges]{.underline} or else its newly won reputation for resolve may
shatter like glass.

As you might expect, scholars have explored these issues for years
without reaching a clear consensus. Credibility skeptics---such as
academics Jonathan Mercer, Ted Hopf, and Daryl Press---argue that
concerns about [**cred**ibility are generally **exaggerated**,
especially when]{.underline} would-be [challengers are trying to
determine if another state will fight]{.underline} to defend a
commitment. They point out that [government officials rarely
base]{.underline} their [estimates]{.underline} of what another state
will do [on]{.underline} the basis of [how that state acted in some
**unrelated context** in the past]{.underline}. Rather, [they base them
on]{.underline} whether it has [interests]{.underline} at stake that are
[worth defending and]{.underline} the [capacity to act]{.underline}
effectively. Other scholars have challenged this conclusion, however,
arguing that [**individual leaders** acquire reputations for
resolve]{.underline} (or weakness) that persist over time and that past
behavior can influence how potential challengers gauge a defender's
level of interest in a given commitment. States with good reputations
may find it easier to form alliances too. There is also the strong
possibility that reputation and credibility are issue-specific: Whether
a state lives up to the terms of a trade deal may tell you next to
nothing about its reliability as an ally or on an issue like arms
control.

The bottom line is that credibility and reputation operate in complex
and contingent ways, and [simple generalizations]{.underline} about
them---such as the sort that politicians and pundits typically
make---[are]{.underline} often **[wrong]{.underline}**. Credibility and
reputation do matter in some circumstances, but how, why, and under what
conditions remain exceedingly difficult to parse. (For a good summary of
recent scholarly developments on this topic, see here.)

I won't try to sort out this complicated set of issues here. Instead, I
want to suggest that the U.S. preoccupation with credibility is, to a
large extent, a function of U.S. geopolitical position and grand
strategy, especially the outsized international responsibilities the
United States has assumed for itself.

At the most basic level, credibility is the likelihood that a state will
fulfill a promise or commitment as perceived by others. With respect to
deterrence, for example, a threat to retaliate is credible if a
potential challenger believes it is likely to be carried out. Even when
a defending state is 100 percent willing to fulfill a particular
commitment, deterrence can still fail if the challenger isn't convinced.

Commitments are not created equal, however. [Some guarantees are
**inherently more credible**]{.underline} than others [because it is
obviously in a state's interest to uphold them]{.underline}. No one
questions whether great powers will defend their own soil against
attack, for example, and even weak states often fight fiercely to defend
their home territory against more powerful invaders. Similarly, states
are more likely to fight to defend important economic interests, such as
access to critical resources. For this reason, U.S. pledges to defend
access to energy supplies from the Persian Gulf were inherently credible
because a significant reduction in energy exports from that region might
be extremely costly. One might say something similar about the
importance of defending Taiwan's chip-making industry, which much of the
world now depends on. During the Cold War, the United States' commitment
to defend its allies in Europe and Asia was also highly credible,
especially if it could be done without using nuclear weapons, because
significant Soviet expansion in either region might have tilted the
global balance of power against the United States.

By contrast, [challengers are more likely to question a commitment when
it is more difficult]{.underline} for them [to see it as vital to the
defender. The U.S. pledge to defend West Berlin]{.underline} during the
Cold War [was harder to demonstrate]{.underline}, for example, [because
the loss of West Berlin would not have affected the balance of
power]{.underline} at all or had much of an impact on U.S. prosperity
back home. West Berlin was an important symbol, of course, and U.S.
leaders worked hard to make the pledge to defend it credible by
explicitly tying it to the broader issue of Western resolve. They also
kept enough troops there to make it impossible for the Warsaw Pact to
seize the city without killing a lot of U.S. soldiers. A credible
commitment was maintained, but it took more effort.

In short, [the more tenuous the link between a]{.underline} particular
[pledge and a country's security]{.underline} and prosperity, [the
**harder it will be to convince others**]{.underline} that [the
commitment is rock-solid]{.underline}. In these situations, defenders
are in effect trying to convince others that they are willing to do
something that might not be in their short-term interest---such as being
willing to do something where the short-term costs exceed the
benefits---to convince challengers that their word is good and other
commitments should not be threatened. They aren't necessarily bluffing,
but others are more likely to suspect this might be the case.

Moreover, the greater the number of less-than-vital interests a country
pledges to defend---that is, the more places it says it may fight to
protect for less-than-vital stakes---the more other states will question
both its willingness and ability to do all that it has promised. Trying
to honor all those commitments may also be expensive, sapping both
resolve and resources over time. Instead of bolstering one's
credibility, defending a lot of secondary interests for the sake of
one's future reputation may unintentionally undermine it.

Here's the real kicker: The United States has a credibility problem in
part because its own geopolitical position is so favorable. There are
relatively few interests that are truly vital to the United States'
independence or prosperity, yet it still maintains a far-flung global
presence and has made a lot of promises to protect other countries.

Start with the first point. [By any measure, the **U**nited **S**tate is
still the **most secure great power in history**]{.underline}. It
possesses [the world's largest economy]{.underline} in nominal terms,
there are [no]{.underline} great-power [rivals near its borders, its
nuclear deterrent consists of thousands of sophisticated **nuc**lear
weapon**s**, and it has powerful conventional]{.underline} military
[forces]{.underline}. No country is going to attack the U.S. homeland
directly, attempt to blockade it, or directly threaten the American way
of life. These features do not insulate Americans from all global
dangers---including contagious viruses---but what country wouldn't trade
places with the United States if it could?

On the one hand, this favorable geopolitical position makes it possible
for the United States to intervene all over the world for the simple
reason that it doesn't have to worry very much about defending its own
territory. But on the other hand, [this also means it has **less
immediate need** to take on ambitious foreign-policy missions.
U.S.]{.underline} military deployments and overseas [commitments
aren't]{.underline} primarily [about defending U.S. soil]{.underline}
directly or protecting American lives at home. Rather, the[y are about
trying to shape events in distant regions in ways]{.underline} that
[U.S. leaders think]{.underline} will [spread]{.underline} a desirable
set of [values or enhance U.S. security]{.underline}---or both.

What this situation implies, however, is that there are few overseas
commitments where it is unmistakably clear to friends, foes, and itself
why the United States should fight for them. Please note: I'm not
arguing for isolationism here; as I've written repeatedly, I think the
United States has a vital interest in helping preserve favorable
balances of power in key strategic areas (specifically, East Asia,
Europe, and---to a lesser extent---the Persian Gulf). I am simply
pointing out that potential challengers have reasons to wonder if every
one of the United States' overseas pledges is something the country
would truly be willing to send its children to die for.

During the Cold War, the United States took on an array of global
missions, most of them directly linked to its broad strategy of
containment. But U.S. ambitions grew even larger once the Cold War was
over, and [Washington spent]{.underline} the next [three decades trying
to create a global liberal order under its own]{.underline} supposedly
benevolent [leadership]{.underline}. Today, [there are dozens of places
where the **U**nited **S**tates is engaged]{.underline}, committed,
obligated, [and]{.underline} in some way [expected to act]{.underline}
should trouble emerge [but where it is **hard to demonstrate that truly
vital interests are at stake**]{.underline}. In these circumstances,
[other states are **bound to question** whether the **U**nited
**S**tates would really do]{.underline} what it has promised to do or
whether it would stay the course should fulfilling the stated mission
prove more difficult than expected. That is why U.S. leaders worry so
much about credibility and why they look for opportunities to
demonstrate resolve. They are hoping that a demonstration of firmness
will convince other challengers not to try their luck, thereby making it
less likely that other commitments will need to be defended.

The danger, of course, is that [this]{.underline} powerful [need to
demonstrate credibility will lead U.S. leaders to]{.underline} fight in
[places that **don't matter** very much]{.underline} in the hopes it
makes it less likely that they will have to fight in places that do. But
there's another option: The United States can make its commitments and
guarantees more credible to others by being more careful and
discriminating when making them. A more selective, realistic, rational,
and restrained approach to overseas commitments will make the ones that
remain more credible because the United States' interest in meeting them
will be readily apparent to potential challengers. [Carefully drawn
commitments are]{.underline} also [more likely to command]{.underline}
more enthusiastic [support]{.underline} from the American people, not
just when answering a pollster's question but also when they are called
on to make genuine sacrifices to fulfill them.

[Concerns about US reliability]{.underline} as an ally [go back to
the]{.underline} beginning of the [Cold War]{.underline}. They were
[particularly]{.underline} acute in the late 1950s and early
1960s---[when the US homeland became increasingly
vulnerable]{.underline} to Soviet nuclear attack---and the late 1960s
through early 1970s, when US efforts at détente and retrenchment called
its reliability into question, particularly in Asia.60 In both cases,
[some US allies did consider acquiring their own nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in response. However, [the US **effectively managed
these concerns and prevented prolif**eration]{.underline}, with the
partial exception of France (as discussed below).

The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in October 1957 and
subsequent Soviet development of an ICBM capability roused significant
concerns among NATO allies, who wondered whether Washington would be
willing to fight a war to protect them if it exposed the US homeland to
Soviet nuclear attack. Shortly after the launch, for instance, France,
West Germany, and Italy began discussing the joint production of nuclear
weapons, which would give Europe an independent deterrent outside US
control.61 While this arrangement broke down under De Gaulle, West
Germany and France maintained nuclear ambitions, with Paris racing
forward on an independent nuclear weapons program and Bonn keeping its
nuclear options open.62 Ultimately, [the US succeeded at convincing West
Germany to renounce nuclear weapons through]{.underline} a combination
of **[coercion]{.underline}**---[making clear an alliance with the US
was incompatible with an independent]{.underline} German nuclear
[arsenal]{.underline}---[and **reassurance**, including the creation of
the **N**uclear **P**lanning **G**roup]{.underline}, which involved West
Germany in NATO nuclear strategy discussions.63 [Italy]{.underline}
likewise [accepted]{.underline} the [forward deployment]{.underline} of
US nuclear weapons, which would be [launched under a dual-key
arrangement, as an alternative to an independent]{.underline} or joint
European [deterrent]{.underline}.64

France, of course, ultimately did acquire its own nuclear weapons,
rejecting the Eisenhower administration's offer of forward-deployed US
nuclear weapons as an alternative.65 While this is often attributed to
the sort of alliance concerns described above, with French leaders not
willing to trust the US to protect them, France's nuclear weapons
program pre-dated Sputnik (and the prior Suez Crisis) by several years.
Further, there is significant evidence suggesting French decision-makers
were largely driven by status concerns---in particular, cementing
France's position as a great power---in seeking their own nuclear
arsenal.66

A second round of concerns about US reliability emerged a decade later.
In the context of pressures for retrenchment due to the Vietnam War, the
Nixon administration pushed its Asian allies to do more to provide for
their own defense---the so-called "Nixon doctrine"---and sought improved
relations with Communist China.67 These [policy changes led South Korea
to initiate a secre]{.underline}t nuclear weapons [program, led Taiwan
to accelerate a nascent program, and caused Japan to revive
consideration]{.underline} of an independent nuclear arsenal.68 [Through
a mix of carrots and sticks, **the US succeeded** in convincing South
Korea and Taiwan to end their nuclear weapons programs]{.underline},69
while [**reassurance** was utilized to]{.underline} help [reinforce
Japan's decision to keep its nuclear capabilities latent]{.underline}.70

[The US track record of preventing allied proliferation despite alliance
credibility concerns is]{.underline} thus **[quite strong, even in
periods where the US was perceived to be in relative
decline]{.underline}**, as it was in the early 1960s and early 1970s.
While France's acquisition of nuclear weapons is an important
counterexample, as noted above, concerns about US reliability were
probably not the decisive factor in leading it to acquire nuclear
weapons. The type of [status concerns that motivated French leaders are
unlikely to lead to proliferation amongst US allies today]{.underline};
while nuclear weapons were markers of prestige in the 1950s and early
1960s, [the emergence of the NPT has]{.underline}, for the most part,
**[flipped the script]{.underline}**, meaning [new proliferators can
expect to lose status and be branded as]{.underline}
"[rogue]{.underline}" states for seeking nuclear weapons.71
Nevertheless, for certain types of leaders, for example, highly
nationalist ones like Turkey's Erdogan, nuclear weapons may retain
appeal.72

Yet despite incremental progress, [Chinese and Russian analysts are
**aware** that the Arctic passage will never achieve its **true
potential** without **Western backing**]{.underline}. [This is why
focusing on the Arctic is likely to have the **largest effect** on
stopping the war in **Ukraine**.]{.underline} The long-sought shipping
route across the High North remains one of the few relatively concrete
geo-economic prizes that the Kremlin prizes on par with Ukraine itself.

Crucially, [a newly dynamic transport corridor should apportion some
percentage of the **ample profits**]{.underline} --- say, 5 percent for
the next five decades --- [to **rebuilding** Ukraine's destroyed
**infrastructure**]{.underline}. This consistent stream of resources
would be a form of reparations payments to Kyiv that would likely amount
to hundreds of billions of dollars.

Undoubtedly, China would strongly support this plan. But [a number of
other interested countries that are currently **estranged** from
**Russia**]{.underline} --- [whether Canada, **Finland**, **Norway**,
and **Sweden** in the West, or **S**outh **K**orea and **Japan** in the
**East**]{.underline} --- [stand to profit from the **NSR** as
well]{.underline}, [with the potential to ease **global tensions**
across **Eurasia**]{.underline}.

[Parts of the U.S. could also economically **benefit**]{.underline},
[including **Alaska**]{.underline}, most obviously, [but also northern
ports like **Seattle** and even **Boston**]{.underline}. [Western
countries at the **table**]{.underline} for the NSR, moreover, [will
likely mean sounder **environmental standards**]{.underline}.

For this deal to have meaningful results, the U.S. would need to lift
sanctions that have been applied against NSR projects. It would also be
helpful if they acted to facilitate major European shipping companies
like Hapag Lloyd and Maersk to green light the route. These steps might
be sufficient, but [the U.S. and Europe could further **sweeten** the
**pot** with encouragement and even incentives for **Western
investment** along the **NSR**]{.underline}.

During the first Trump administration, the president made some bold
gestures in foreign policy and commendably took some political risks for
peace. To be sure, the difficult issues with respect to separation of
forces, the rights of citizens in eastern Ukraine, and the yet to be
determined security architecture for Eastern Europe will remain
paramount in any settlement.

[Yet by appending peace proposals with a carrot **guaranteed** to catch
**Putin's attention**]{.underline}, [negotiations having a substantial
Arctic component could gain Trump's **favor** and find
success]{.underline}. Trump's embrace and marketing of this large-scale
business deal could not only help bring peace back to Eastern Europe,
but could also revitalize the continent's prospects more generally.

### NATO Resilient\-\--2AC

#### NATO [survives]{.underline}, even without the United States. 

Andrew **Adonis 25**, Labour Member of the House of Lords in the British
Parliament, Ph.D. from Nuffield College, University of Oxford, "The
essence of Nato will survive," Prospect Magazine, 02-19-2025, accessed

Don't be too alarmed. **[The essence of Nato will
survive]{.underline}**, maybe not in its current form but certainly as a
security and military alliance embracing Europe's democracies and other
allies. However, incredibly, [the **U**nited **S**tates may soon not be
among these allies if Trump follows through on the threats and
imprecations against democratic Europe made by]{.underline} vice
president JD [Vance and]{.underline} defense secretary Pete
[Hegseth]{.underline} at last week's Munich Secretary Conference.

**[Either Nato or a direct successor organisation will
survive]{.underline}**, even if its only North American member is
Canada, [because the threat]{.underline} of invasion and destabilisation
[from Russia has not dissipated]{.underline}. And [such an organisation
is]{.underline} essential for European democracies to be able to pledge
collective security and pool their military efforts, separate from---but
[intimately linked to]{.underline}---[the **E**uropean
**U**nion]{.underline}, whose remit is economic not military.

When Nato was founded in 1949 by Ernest Bevin and George Marshall, the
foreign ministers of Britain and the US, the imperative was to prevent
Josef Stalin taking over western Europe, as he had most of central and
eastern Europe. Britain and the US had just held on to the British and
American zones of West Berlin---within the territory of
Soviet-controlled eastern Germany---after Stalin's bitterly fought
Berlin Blockade. They were determined to prevent further incursions, and
in particular to protect the nascent West Germany, which for obvious
reasons lacked an army.

[Nato has **succeeded spectacularly** as a defensive
alliance]{.underline}. By 1955 Stalin was dead, West Germany and Turkey
had joined Nato, the Russians had withdrawn from Austria and western
Europe was secure. [Nato was an indispensable part of the west's
resistance to Soviet communism]{.underline} until the fall of the Berlin
Wall in 1989, after which almost all of the formerly Soviet-controlled
central and eastern European states---including the newly united
Germany---joined the Nato club.

For a brief period in the 1990s, it looked as if Nato might become
largely redundant because Boris Yeltsin's Russia itself might become a
western democracy. Russia might then have joined Nato too, alongside
former Soviet republics including Ukraine. But Yeltsin's successor was
Vladimir Putin, and the rest is history.

[The key point is that, Ukraine apart, the entire European border of
Russia]{.underline} now [comprises Nato members]{.underline}---including
Finland which, together with Sweden, rushed to join after Putin's
invasion of Ukraine three years ago. It is **[only Nato's collective
strength]{.underline}** which **[gives credibility to the defence of
this long border against an increasingly belligerent Russia. So with or
without the US, if Nato did not exist, it would have to be
created]{.underline}**. And [this collective entity will]{.underline}
need to [enhance Europe's engagement with free Ukraine to prevent a
Russian takeover]{.underline}.

Trump is now weighing up whether his preferred partner is democratic
Europe or Putin's Russia---or an opportunist combination of the two.
This incredible geopolitical crisis is being played out in the
negotiations over the fate of Ukraine. [If Trump abandons Ukraine,
**Europe will**]{.underline} have to **[step up and]{.underline}** in
effect **[take over Nato, with or without the US]{.underline}** as a
continuing member. [The alternative]{.underline}---leaving Europe
without any collective defence---[is unconscionable]{.underline}. This
is the significance of the European leaders coming together for an
emergency meeting in Paris this Monday, in reaction to [Vance and
Hegseth's alarming speeches]{.underline} and statements in Munich. Taken
together, their speeches [amount to a **massive appeasement of Putin**
and a huge question mark over Trump's commitment]{.underline} not only
to Ukraine but [to the wider defence of Europe]{.underline}.

The immediate emergency issue is how to protect the currently unoccupied
majority of Ukraine from falling to Putin. It is imperative to prevent
an outright Russian victory in the current war if it continues and the
US withdraws support. It is equally important to be able to defend
Ukraine effectively against renewed Russian aggression should there be a
ceasefire. Either way, Europe is going to have to make a much larger
contribution to collective defence.

But there is another possibility. Great dictators often fall out. Maybe
the current Trump/Putin bromance turns sour and/or the threat from China
becomes too serious for the US to risk a complete rupture with Europe on
trade and defence. [There are still plenty of Washington
bigwigs]{.underline}, including Republican politicians and military and
economic strategists, [whose heart is firmly with the Atlantic alliance.
**They may be down, but they are not yet out**]{.underline}.

of Chicago; Euro News, "Could another European country develop its own
nuclear weapons?,"
https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/21/could-another-european-country-develop-its-own-nuclear-weapons;
Accessed 7.16.25\]

[Although some European states have **some** of the elements required to
develop independent nuclear weapons capability]{.underline},
[**experts** say the chances of another European state going nuclear are
**slim**]{.underline}.

Starting from scratch

According to Fabian Rene Hoffmann, a research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear
Project, [even if one of Europe's NATO powers were keen to develop its
**own nuclear weapons** rather than simply **hosting
them**]{.underline}, [it would find itself at a **standing
start**]{.underline}.

"[The major issue European countries are facing is that they either
don't deploy the civilian nuclear infrastructure to launch a nuclear
**weapons programme**]{.underline}, or, if they have civilian nuclear
infrastructure, that [it is highly]{.underline}
'**[proliferation-resistant']{.underline}**," he told Euronews.

"For example, Finland and Sweden only have light-water reactors, which
are not suitable for the production of weapons-grade plutonium. In
addition, n[either of those countries have chemical reprocessing plants
that are needed for separating wanted from **unwanted isotopes** in
**fissile material production**]{.underline}.\"

\"So even if they wanted to launch a nuclear program, [they couldn't do
so with their **existing infrastructure**]{.underline}, at least in the
short-term. [That's the case for **all** non-nuclear weapon states in
**Europe**]{.underline} with a civilian nuclear programme right now."

Hoffman acknowledged one arguable exception: Germany.

"While it does not deploy significant civilian nuclear infrastructure
anymore, it has a large stockpile of highly-enriched uranium for
research purposes,\" he explained. \"Theoretically, this stockpile could
be repurposed under some effort to create weapons-grade fissile
material."

"[But **even then** it would only be enough for around 5 to 15 nuclear
warheads]{.underline}, so [it would not be enough to deploy what we call
a]{.underline} "**[robust]{.underline}**" **[nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**.\"

Opening the umbrella

Both of Europe's nuclear-armed powers, the UK and France, have big
decisions to make about their nuclear futures.

As things stand, the UK's limited submarine-based deterrent is facing an
uncertain future. The fleet used to carry its missiles is ageing and set
to be replaced, and more pressingly still, the missiles themselves are
made and stockpiled at a US base, meaning the British deterrent is
unusually reliant on the participation of another state.

France's deterrent, by contrast, is larger and more independent of NATO,
and is not confined to submarines. That means it could potentially be
"forward-deployed" elsewhere in Europe --- but as Hoffman explained,
this is not as simple an idea as it sounds.

"Infrastructure would have to be built up in the hosting states, most
notably bunkers," he told Euronews. "I would also say that
forward-deploying French nuclear weapons in Germany wouldn't really make
any difference. If at all, they should be forward-deployed to the
frontline states" --- that is, Russia-facing countries including Poland.

His comments come after Poland said it would like US nuclear warheads to
be deployed on Polish soil.

Out of the shadows

After the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Warsaw Pact, Poland
was rid of the Soviet nuclear weapons that had been stationed on its
territory. Like most European countries, it has since signed up to
various international agreements to limit the spread of nuclear weapons,
including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

[Were Poland or another European state to start developing its **own
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [it would be abandoning a **norm** that
has held sway in the West for **three decades**]{.underline}.

[The highly developed global nuclear **non-proliferation
regime**]{.underline} [has long been focused on curtailing the **North
Korea**]{.underline}n weapons programme, heading off weapons-grade
enrichment in Iran, [and preventing uncontrolled international flows of
**uranium**]{.underline}, plutonium, and the components needed to enrich
enough of either to create a viable nuclear device.

The prospect of a European state developing weapons itself has not been
bargained for --- but that does not mean an aspiring proliferator would
be able to do so under the radar.

"[None of the European non-nuclear weapon states would likely be able to
**secretly proliferate**]{.underline}," Hoffman said. "Just like
anywhere else in the world, [nuclear infrastructure and nuclear-related
assets in Europe are under the **strict safeguards**]{.underline} [of
the **I**]{.underline}nternational **[A]{.underline}**tomic
**[E]{.underline}**nergy **[A]{.underline}**gency, meaning any
diversions would most likely be noticed."

On the other hand, [the degree of fragility]{.underline} discussed by
some of the authors [may be **exaggerated**]{.underline} in some other
respects. For example, [fears of nuclear proliferation]{.underline}
extending from 'Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to South Korea, Japan,
and Germany',35 [may be]{.underline} somewhat
**[alarmist]{.underline}**. With the exception of Iran, serious debates
in these other states about 'going nuclear' are certainly more prominent
than they once were (Saudi Arabia and South Korea), or perhaps exist now
in ways they previously didn't (Turkey, Japan and Germany), but [fears
of a nuclear free-for-all need to be counterbalanced by a]{.underline}
more [substantive reflection on the traditional inhibitions of these
countries becoming nuclear powers, as well as the **political,
diplomatic, military and technical challenges** of]{.underline} them
[doing so]{.underline}. Similarly, some [caution should be exercised
with regards to]{.underline} Talmadge's contention that as [the number
of nuclear actors]{.underline} increase so too does the risk that 'a
nuclear crisis that initially involves only two states could
inadvertently come to involve other states, [or that two separate,
concurrent nuclear crises could]{.underline} inadvertently [exacerbate
each other]{.underline}'.36 Whilst such risks may exist in theory,
[constructing a plausible scenario would seem]{.underline} to be
[**extremely difficult** in the absence of a clearer idea of the
political context of these crises, which]{.underline} at least in
historical cases have [highlighted **policymakers' reluctance to let
matters get out of hand**, especially the inappropriateness of
contemplating nuclear use when the stakes involved have been **limited**
rather than existential]{.underline}.37 Nevertheless, as is so often the
case with the practice of deterrence, the [nuclear scenarios utilized by
political and military actors may be **unrealistic**, but they influence
policy and strategy]{.underline} nonetheless. Talmadge is therefore
quite correct to assert the prospects for arms control are 'dim'.38

But [for many states, a journey towards a credible minimum deterrent
could prove **long, lonely and perilous**. Many]{.underline} non-nuclear
weapon states [lack the infrastructure to produce fissile material and
are bound by **non-prolif**eration agreements, including the NPT and the
123 Agreements with the US. They would]{.underline} probably [**struggle
to find willing partners** to assist]{.underline} with an explicit
nuclear weapons programme, and [any such assistance would]{.underline}
very likely [be detected. Exiting non-proliferation agreements could
**alienate potential proliferators**, with consequences for their
economies, alliances and defence cooperation]{.underline}. Some
[potential proliferators could face]{.underline} the prospect of a
**[sabotage]{.underline}** campaign, [or]{.underline}, in the most
extreme circumstances, a [military intervention]{.underline} aimed at
nipping their weapons programme in the bud.

[Domestic nuclear programs by]{.underline} either [Germany or Poland
are]{.underline} also [regularly raised]{.underline} in public debates.
[Not excluding any possible option]{.underline}, including nuclear
proliferation, [can serve political leaders in times of crisis to signal
to domestic audiences, partners, and adversaries alike. **Neither** a
German nor a Polish domestic nuclear weapons program **is feasible in a
timeframe that would improve deterrence**. There are **technical
barriers** in]{.underline} terms of [acquiring fissile material,
weaponizing and testing a device as well as mounting it on delivery
systems]{.underline} that would be sufficiently credible and survivable.
[Most of these]{.underline} barriers [can be **overcome** or even
**lowered depending on the willingness of other states to support such
an endeavor**]{.underline} notably the United States, which, given that
the purpose is to lessen dependence on an unreliable ally, seems
contradictory. Financially, [developing a functioning nuclear deterrent
is expensive and would divert funds from other needed defense
investments]{.underline}. Legally, [it would require withdrawing
from]{.underline} a number of [international agreements, with potential
consequences]{.underline} depending on the acceptance of partners.
Finally, [any aspiring nuclear state in Europe would **open itself up to
preemptive Russian actions**]{.underline}.

More importantly, [neither an EU-led program nor new domestic European
nuclear programs **make sense** if the purpose is to strengthen the
credibility of nuclear deterrence]{.underline} in Europe [or offset
deterrence gaps vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline} in the absence of US
guarantees. [They only offer]{.underline} the prospect of "**[a
capability without a concept]{.underline}**." Other proposals that are
often discussed involve ways of expanding, tapping into, or contributing
to existing European nuclear forces, meaning French and British
arsenals. The debate is now reaching new heights as Macron has
explicitly called for opening a dialogue on the deterrence role that
French nuclear forces could play.

#### No European prolif\-\--they're [hyper-aware]{.underline} of the consequences.

International Affairs, "An Anxious Europe Ponders Nuclear Weapons,"

European states would do well to consider Australia's pursuit of
nuclear-powered submarines through the AUKUS agreement to inform their
own ongoing debate. While these submarines will not carry nuclear
warheads, regional powers such as Indonesia did question AUKUS'
legitimacy, considering Australia's commitment to non-proliferation.
Certainly, the outright pursuit of nuclear warheads by the EU would be
legitimately challenged in the same way. [To acquire **nuc**lear
weapon**s**, European states would]{.underline} have to [**withdraw from
the NPT** which would]{.underline}, no doubt, [undermine the
international rules-based order]{.underline} that they wish to preserve.

Furthermore, [it would be hypocritical of Europe to insist on
non-proliferation]{.underline}, for instance toward Iran [through
the]{.underline} Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
([JPCOA]{.underline}) or [other states]{.underline} which [might wish to
acquire **nuc**lear weapon**s**, such as **Saudi Arabia** or South
**Korea**]{.underline}, but then become a proliferator itself. [This
would **set a dangerous precedent**]{.underline}, potentially [perceived
as a]{.underline} "**[go ahead]{.underline}**" [by other states who wish
to acquire **nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}.

Similarly[, it is questionable whether the US would tolerate nuclear
**prolif**eration in Europe]{.underline}. Certainly, the US has the
means to prevent the pursuit of nuclear weapons, as seen in 2009 and
2010 when it allegedly employed the Stuxnet computer virus to sabotage
Iranian enrichment centrifuges. [Even if the US were to abstain from
sabotaging European efforts, it would]{.underline} nonetheless
[constitute a **rupture in the transatlantic alliance**]{.underline}.
That Trump would only be president for four years, were he to return to
the White House, [it is short-sighted to sacrifice the]{.underline}
important postwar [alliance]{.underline} structure which has hitherto
guaranteed peace in Europe, in favour of a potentially calamitous
undertaking. Furthermore, [it is questionable whether the EU as a whole,
with its **slow-moving bureaucracy**, could acquire **nuc**lear
weapon**s** in a timely manner. This]{.underline} question [would
likewise apply if individual European states]{.underline} were to
[pursue independent nuclear capabilities]{.underline}, as none appear in
a position to do so with expediency. [While current
discussions]{.underline} about European nuclear weapons [emphasise the
need to deter Russia]{.underline}, the reality is that [such weapons
**cannot be acquired overnight**]{.underline}. Their [acquisition would
likely take]{.underline} years, if not **[decades]{.underline}**, and
[Europe must deter]{.underline} aggressors **[today]{.underline}**.

[European allies could]{.underline} also [pursue their own nuclear
arsenals]{.underline}. This option would provide sovereign control over
nuclear use and address the issue of will: there would be less doubt
that a state would use nuclear weapons to protect its own security
rather than that of an ally. However, [there are **significant practical
obstacles**]{.underline} to build the capabilities needed for a credible
nuclear deterrence.

[Developing]{.underline} the [weapons, delivery systems, and
infrastructure necessary for a nuclear arsenal that could survive a
first strike would require significant time and resources. The length of
time needed to achieve these capabilities creates a **window of
vulnerability that could invite a preventative attack**]{.underline} --
[the very thing]{.underline} that [these states want to
avoid]{.underline}. In addition to these technical and security
challenges, [any such pursuit would violate the]{.underline} Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty ([NPT]{.underline}), to which all European
allies are parties, [incurring **major reputational** costs and
**economic costs if states impose sanctions** to counter nuclear
pursuit]{.underline}.

Considering the difficulties of extended nuclear deterrence, many
European commentators and decisionmakers instinctively regard the
acquisition of nuclear weapons as the most viable path forward. It is
thus not surprising that, in March 2025, the Polish prime minister
suggested to his country's parliament that Warsaw should keep its
options open. [Most European nations possess the technical expertise and
physical resources necessary to develop their own nuclear arsenals.
However]{.underline}, embarking on [such an undertaking would involve
**significant costs** and **considerable time**]{.underline}. While some
of the world's most advanced industrial nations would most certainly be
able to replicate technologies that are eight decades old, [obtaining
fissile materials, building reliable warheads, and developing effective
delivery systems pose **highly complex challenges**]{.underline}.

And nuclear proliferation is anything but risk-free. [If Europeans
misinterpret U.S. commitments while Washington remains
dedicated]{.underline} to preserving its order, [it is likely to take
steps to **stop its allies**]{.underline}. Past experience suggests that
[the **U**nited **S**tates can mobilize substantial diplomatic,
economic, and political resources to exert pressure on]{.underline} both
[friends and adversaries to prevent nuclear proliferation]{.underline}.
Conversely, if Washington were to fully abandon its commitment to
protecting its allies, [Moscow would]{.underline} likely [see few
reasons to refrain from **using all force at its disposal to prevent
prolif**eration]{.underline}. Considering that [key nuclear facilities
are]{.underline} comparatively [**easy to identify and strike**,
and]{.underline} that [Russia will continue to hold an escalation
edge]{.underline} through its strategic, tactical, and long-range
capabilities, [European nations]{.underline} will likely [face **serious
challenges** in any counterproliferation scenario]{.underline}.

## Impact\-\--Frontline States

### Frontline States\-\--U\-\--2AC

#### Frontline states are already preparing for a world without us.

Carlos **Torralba 25**, Reporter at El País, "Atomic bombs and

While nuclear weapons are being debated behind closed doors in several
European capitals, [all EU members that share a border with Russia are
**accelerating their plans** to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty, which
prohibits the manufacture, use, stockpiling, and transfer of
anti-personnel mines. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia
announced]{.underline} on March 19 that [they will withdraw]{.underline}
this year. [Finland followed suit]{.underline} two weeks later. On
Tuesday, Karlis Neretnieks, a retired general and director of Sweden's
National Defense College, called on Sweden to also withdraw from the
Ottawa Treaty and acquire anti-personnel mines as soon as possible.

Norway, the only NATO member other than the EU that borders Russia,
maintains its ban on these types of mines and rejects the measure
adopted by its allies. "If we start weakening our commitment, we make it
easier for these weapons to be used again in conflicts around the world,
because we reduce the stigma," declared Barth Eide, the Norwegian
Minister of Defense. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have
also harshly criticized the step taken by Poland, Finland, and the
Baltic countries.

Kalev Stoicescu, chairman of the Estonian Parliament's Defense
Committee, justified the controversial measure over the phone: "[If we
have to stop invading hordes, as we see them fighting in Ukraine, we
will be ready to use these]{.underline}, so to speak, inhumane means."
Stoicescu, who was ambassador to the United States and Canada when the
convention was signed in 1997 in Ottawa, maintains that [Estonia wants
to have]{.underline} "[a free hand]{.underline}" [to
confront]{.underline} "the threat posed by [Russia and
Belarus]{.underline}."

Fear of Moscow led Poland, Finland, and the Baltic countries to become
the last EU members to sign the Ottawa Convention. Vilnius, Tallinn, and
Riga did so between 2003 and 2005; Helsinki and Warsaw did not ratify it
until 2012. In addition to initiating the procedure to lift the ban on
anti-personnel mines, Lithuania formally withdrew in March from the
Convention on Cluster Munitions, to which Poland, Finland, Estonia, and
Latvia never acceded.

#### Countries are [actively seeking]{.underline} alternatives.

Accessed 7.18.25\]

THE SHAPE OF NATO IS CHANGING. [As the United States **withdraws** from
the leadership position it has held since the **foundation** of the
alliance]{.underline}, other countries are stepping up. Uncertain of the
American nuclear umbrella, [France and the United Kingdom are hinting at
**extending** their own]{.underline}. Policy toward the alliance's most
important zones---the east and the far north---is being driven by the
Nordic-Baltic Eight. And after visiting Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
last week, it's become clear to me that not only the Baltic governments
but the Baltic peoples are emerging as new political leaders of the
world's most successful military alliance.

Last month, the governments of [Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania issued a
**joint declaration**]{.underline}: In the event of an emergency---the
implication being a Russian attack---[**all three nations** will protect
and relocate civilians, including across the three **countries' shared
borders**]{.underline}. "It was jointly agreed that national security is
determined not only by military capabilities but also by the readiness
of internal security systems, and their ability to maintain stability,
anticipate, respond to, and withstand various crises," said the Latvian
Interior Ministry in a press release. The Baltics' announcement signals
a dramatic evolution from individual national planning to collective,
synchronized action---a recognition that survival in today's Europe
requires more than independence. It requires interdependence.

[While the 2025 NATO Summit was consumed by **political
theater**]{.underline}---especially the effort to accommodate President
Trump's skepticism of NATO obligations---just a few miles away, the
International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for former Russian
Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Gen.
Valeriy Gerasimov for deliberately attacking civilian targets in
Ukraine. For the Baltic states, the implications are unmistakable: If
Russia could commit those crimes against the citizens of Ukraine, it
could do the same to them. [And if NATO's unity **wavers**, and
**deterrence fails**, then they're **prepared** to
**fight**]{.underline}.

[But the Baltics aren't **acting alone**]{.underline}. [Not only are
they cooperating more deeply and more actively in their **common
defense**]{.underline}, but [they are supported by **other NATO
allies**]{.underline} who are committed to defending them even if the
alliance as a whole comes up short. In Estonia, the United Kingdom leads
a battlegroup supported by French, Danish, and Icelandic forces. [In
Latvia, a **Canadian-led force** trains alongside personnel from Italy,
Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic]{.underline}. [In
Lithuania, **Dutch**, **Norwegian**, and **Belgian** forces reinforce a
full **German brigade**]{.underline} which, in a long-awaited move,
[Berlin has now committed to permanently **forward-stationing**
there]{.underline}.

### Frontline States\-\--Thumpers\-\--2AC

#### Either Trump [thumps]{.underline} OR proves relations are [resilient]{.underline} because countries are [already moving away]{.underline} from the U.S.

Nordic-Baltic Pragmatism," Internationale Politik Quarterly, 04-15-2025,
accessed 07-18-2025,
https://ip-quarterly.com/en/case-nordic-baltic-pragmatism, DG

[When]{.underline} Donald [Trump was re-elected]{.underline} as
president of the US in November 2024, [the mood in the Nordic and Baltic
states as well as in Poland was]{.underline} somewhat [**less anxious
than in most of Europe**. The countries believed themselves to be in a
good position for pragmatic engagement]{.underline} with the second
Trump administration, thanks to their high level of defense spending,
traditionally strong bilateral relations with the United States, and
their rather positive experience of the first Trump presidency, when the
US presence in NATO's eastern flank countries increased.

Five months later, **[the space for pragmatism has dramatically
narrowed]{.underline}**. Finland may have scored points through an act
of "golf diplomacy" that President Alexander Stubb conducted with Donald
Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and may succeed in securing a big deal for the
selling of ice-breakers to the US. Yet there is no way of denying the
rapid decay of the transatlantic alliance.

President [Trump has **shocked his best allies in Europe** with his soft
approach to]{.underline} President Vladimir Putin's [Russia and **utter
disregard for the sovereignty of Denmark and Ukraine**, expressed by his
desire to take over Greenland and gain control of Ukraine's critical
minerals]{.underline} (not to speak about the humiliating treatment of
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office). [US tariffs
against EU member states as well as the United Kingdom are not just
causing economic losses but **threaten to destroy** the global system of
**free trade** that all the small Northern European states have been
strongly committed to and reliant on]{.underline}.

The US Is Still Needed

Yet some things have not changed: [Russia is still a long-term and
existential threat for the Nordic-Baltic states and Poland]{.underline},
and [the US **remains**]{.underline} an **[indispensable]{.underline}**
ally in countering this threat. [Europeans are]{.underline} thus far
[not able to provide Ukraine with sufficient military
support]{.underline} for stopping Russia's slow advance on the
battlefield. [They are]{.underline} also [struggling to come up with a
credible response]{.underline} to Ukraine's need for security guarantees
beyond the war. Even more importantly, [NATO's defense and deterrence
**rely on the US** contributing critical capabilities]{.underline} that
Europeans lack such as intelligence, air defense, and a nuclear shield.

[As **trust**]{.underline} in the strongest ally has [**crumbled**,
dependence on]{.underline} the [security guarantees]{.underline} that it
provides [has become increasingly problematic. Countries in Northern
Europe are]{.underline} therefore [doubling down]{.underline} their
[efforts to strengthen their defense capabilities. Poland is spending
4.7 percent of its GDP on defense]{.underline} this year and aims to
reach 5 percent next year. [The Baltic states are]{.underline} also
[moving toward the 5-percent target. Finland]{.underline} has recently
[announced that it will spend a minimum of 3 percent of GDP on
defense]{.underline} in the next four years. [Sweden is about to reach
2.4 percent]{.underline} of GDP in 2025 and aims at 3.5 percent by 2030.
[Denmark is committed to more than 3 percent]{.underline} this year and
next.

Europe's Dilemma

[It has become the]{.underline} most important task---but also the
**[biggest dilemma for Europe]{.underline}**---**[to try to keep the US
engaged]{.underline}** in European defense, [while **preparing for its
possible abandonment**]{.underline}. Needless to say, **[the countries
that are most vulnerable to the Russian threat are facing this dilemma
in its sharpest form]{.underline}**.

At the surface level, the same measures are required for both
maintaining the US presence and preparing for its withdrawal. The key to
solving the puzzle is that Europeans need to become militarily stronger.
However, a closer look into defense planning reveals that it is not the
same thing to prepare to defend Europe with a reduced US contribution or
without the US. According to some estimates, it would take up to 10
years for Europeans to replace most of the US competences in NATO.

So far, [Europeans are struggling to meet]{.underline} their
[commitments in NATO's defense plans]{.underline}, adopted at the
Vilnius Summit in 2023, [even if the Americans are doing their
share]{.underline}. The [plans are built on]{.underline} the promise of
the [Europeans taking on a bigger share of the burden]{.underline}. In
the meantime, [the focus of the European debate has moved from
burden-sharing to burden-shifting, and **from the desire to keep the
Americans on board to the need to prepare for their departure**. It will
not be enough to implement the defense plans in the spirit of
burden-sharing]{.underline}; Europeans need to prepare for
burden-shifting, i.e., taking over the share of the US.

There has been reluctance in the Eastern flank countries to talk about
burden-shifting out of fear that speaking about Europe's aim to take
over US commitments will encourage the latter to precipitate its
withdrawal. Yet it would be irresponsible for Europeans not to prepare
for a scenario where the US will not come to defend its allies or will
demand an unbearable price for doing so. [Even if the US maintains its
military presence in Europe, the Trump administration's motivation to do
so seems to profoundly differ from that of its
predecessors]{.underline}---[it is no longer]{.underline} about
[protecting freedom, democracy, and the right of sovereign nations to
choose their alliances]{.underline}. Instead, [**Trump's focus is on the
narrow interests of his own power position and his MAGA vision**. Even
if he wishes to achieve peace in Ukraine or to keep NATO alive, from the
European perspective **he is doing so for the wrong
reasons**]{.underline}.

Sticking Together

[The Nordic-Baltic states are **sticking together**]{.underline} in the
turbulent geopolitical environment. [Regional cooperation is **closer
than ever**]{.underline} especially [in the field of security and
defense, which used to be a no-go]{.underline} area even in Nordic
cooperation not so long ago. [The accession of Finland and Sweden to
NATO removed old barriers]{.underline}. Together with Poland, Germany,
and the United Kingdom, the Northern Europeans form a considerable,
though loose grouping with largely shared security interests. [Germany's
ability to spend]{.underline} wisely the hundreds of billions of planned
[additional funding for defense will be of critical importance
for]{.underline} further [enhancing defense and deterrence in the Baltic
Sea region and **reducing dependence on the US**]{.underline}.

While regional efforts matter, it is also worth noting that [the
security of the Baltic Sea region is **inseparable from European
security at large** and will heavily depend on the outcome of the war in
Ukraine]{.underline}. It also, crucially, depends on the willingness of
other European countries to invest more in collective defense.

Testing Times

There is no doubt that [the US]{.underline} will try to drive wedges
between European countries. It [might]{.underline} also [test the unity
of the Northern European grouping. **If the US becomes even more
assertive vis-à-vis Greenland it will be difficult for**]{.underline}
the other **[Nordic-Baltic countries not to condemn this]{.underline}**,
but will they risk their relationship with the US? If the US requires
its allies to stop supporting Ukraine in order to force Kyiv to accept a
bad peace deal, will the Nordic-Baltic countries, which have been
staunch supporters of Ukraine, risk losing the security guarantee of the
US? Would it be more dangerous for them to go along with a bad deal for
Ukraine in the hope of saving their relationship with the US, or to
continue supporting Ukraine and reckon that the US has become an
unreliable ally in any case? Hopefully such choices can be avoided, but
it cannot be excluded that they might emerge.

In the spirit of Northern pragmatism, [the optimal way forward would be
**managed burden-shifting pursued under the disguise of strengthening
the transatlantic alliance**. A gradual move toward a more European NATO
might be **the only way to keep the alliance alive and Europe safe in
the coming years**]{.underline}. The critical question is if Europeans
will have enough time to pursue this approach. The faster they move, the
better the chances of preventing NATO's collapse at the time when the
alliance is badly needed to protect Europe against Russia's revanchist
aggression.

### Frontline States\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Germany\-\--2AC

#### Poland [can't leave us]{.underline}. 

Ieva **Gajauskaitė 23**, Associate Professor of Global Politics at the

Science from Vytautas Magnus University, "Poland's Resilient
Atlanticism," in *European Strategic Autonomy and Small States\'
Security: In the Shadow of Power*, pp. 63-80, Routledge, 2023

[For Poland, it was quite clear]{.underline} that [US security
guarantees for NATO's eastern flank **could not be based solely on**
geostrategic position or **NATO** commitments]{.underline}. For this
reason, [strategic **coop**eration was linked to the US involvement in
the **modernisation**]{.underline} programme **[of the Polish Defence
Forces]{.underline}**, namely the acquisition of armaments (Informacja
Ministra Spraw Zagranicznych, 2018). Furthermore, [Poland sought to
respond to]{.underline} the [expectations of]{.underline} US President
Donald [Trump for]{.underline} the [member states to contribute more to
their security]{.underline}. For this reason, Poland's political elite
has pledged to increase its defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2030,
making it "an example to others" (Informacja Ministra Spraw
Zagranicznych, 2019).

During Donald Trump's presidency, Poland sought to become the US's
exclusive strategic partner in Europe and, for this reason, rejected any
initiatives that could be directed against the states, especially those
proposed by a traditionally anti-American France. The fact that France
did not offer Poland to contribute to the EI2 served as another example
that France has no interest in strengthening NATO. Thus, [Poland was
seeking to take the place of the **U**nited **K**ingdom in the
EU]{.underline}, not only to gain the status of a key strategic partner
of the US but also [to prevent the EU from developing
initiatives]{.underline} that are [incompatible with the strategic
interests of the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} (Buras & Zerka,
2018).

The second reason for Poland's reluctance to support loose ESA is the
lack of consensus on the use of military force since states have
different conceptions and interests. [Eastern European countries are
interested in strengthening collective defence capabilities, while
Western and Southern Europe seek to strengthen EU crisis management
capabilities]{.underline} (Gotkowska, 2017). [The number one priority of
Poland's security and defence policy is a **political agreement between
NATO members that Russia is a threat to Eastern Europe**]{.underline}.
As a result, [there are differences in **strategic
culture**]{.underline}, which means that European countries are
reluctant to use military force and are more likely to use soft power.
Therefore, according to former Polish Foreign Minister Witold
Waszczykowski, "**[Europe from Venus needs US from Mars]{.underline}**"
(Waszczykowski, 2020).

Even though the US withdrawal from Afghanistan has sparked a debate in
Poland over US future priorities, [the]{.underline} primary [truth
believed by Poland remains the same]{.underline} [-- the EU is **not
capable of resolving an international crisis without the
US**]{.underline}. There are several reasons for this. The first, of
course, is the lack of capacity. [Poland]{.underline}, for example,
[often emphasises not only the inability to use EU Battlegroups but also
the inability of the most powerful European states to carry out any
mission without US military support]{.underline}: "Even France, the
greatest military power of the EU, which has the nuclear arsenal, is not
able to carry out such actions on its own. In Mali it is supported by
American air transport, American drones, and American intelligence."
(Słojewska, 2021). Consequently, [Poland **prioritises bilateral
coop**eration **with the U**nited **S**tates within and outside the NATO
framework]{.underline} (Malinowski, 2021). In addition, [Poland
reassures itself with the thought that due to the **US military presence
in Poland**, in case of an attack]{.underline} by a third country, [the
US and NATO would be]{.underline} "**[automatically
drawn]{.underline}**" **[into war]{.underline}** (Zięba, 2020, p. 125).

### Frontline States\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Global\-\--2AC

#### Credibility is [context-dependent]{.underline}, and collapse is [inevitable]{.underline}.

[U.S. **cred**ibility]{.underline} has [underpinned the postwar global
order]{.underline} that Americans have benefited from for more than 75
years. It's a well-known story. After World War II, the United States
harnessed its economic and military superiority to spearhead the
reconstruction of Europe and Japan and the creation of the United
Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. Crucially, it drew on its
stock of credibility to construct those institutions and persuade other
states---including newly independent ones in Africa and Asia---to join
them.

During the Cold War, Washington leveraged its credibility to build a
network of military alliances, most importantly NATO, and under the
Truman Doctrine to support nations "resisting attempted subjugation by
armed minorities or by outside pressures." But at the core of this
policy to contain the Soviet Union, its architect George Kennan wrote,
was "a test of the overall worth of the United States," including
whether it could successfully manage both "the problems of its internal
life" and "the responsibilities of a world power."

[Washington's record]{.underline} on both counts [was **mixed**.
The]{.underline} "[city upon a hill]{.underline}," a beacon of freedom
and democracy, [coexisted with]{.underline} racial segregation under
[Jim Crow]{.underline} lasting until the 1960s. That terrible
inequality, as well as interventions to topple foreign governments,
undermined U.S. leadership abroad. Yet the United States' capacity for
self-criticism, reform, and rejuvenation meant that when the Berlin Wall
fell in 1989, U.S. democracy, however imperfect, remained a model around
the world.

U.S. credibility arguably reached its height in the 1990s---the onset of
a "unipolar moment" of unrivaled American dominance. With military
primacy, the world's largest and most dynamic economy, an extraordinary
cultural attraction that compelled Joseph Nye to coin in these pages the
term "soft power," and widespread confidence in U.S.-led globalization,
Washington presided over what some observers later termed a "liberal
international order." America's AAA geopolitical credit rating allowed
Washington to project power widely without risking overextension.

[Although the **U**nited **S**tates remains the world's leading
power]{.underline} in 2023, [it is no longer obvious]{.underline} that
[it can single-handedly **uphold**]{.underline}---**[still less
revitalize]{.underline}**---[the international order. This reflects not
only a shifting balance of power]{.underline}, principally [marked by
the rise of China, but also other countries' concerns about the
**growing gap** between the **U**nited **S**tates' global commitments
and its willingness and ability to follow through]{.underline} on them.
There are growing doubts about Washington's credibility.

Those doubts are not primarily about hard power. At \$27 trillion, U.S.
GDP accounts for roughly 25 percent of global economic output---the same
share as at the end of the Cold War. Many of the world's leading and
most innovative companies are based in the United States and are often
founded and led by first- or second-generation immigrants. And despite
continued speculation about potential alternatives, the U.S. dollar
remains the world's reserve currency by a wide margin.

The immense and dynamic U.S. economy supports its position as the only
country capable of projecting military power across the globe; its
defense budget---approximately \$877 billion in 2022---remains the
world's largest. With some 750 military bases in 80 countries, moreover,
the United States enjoys an unrivaled defense network that facilitates
its global power projection.

[Washington]{.underline}, of course, [faces significant economic and
strategic challenges]{.underline}. The United States' [national debt
reached \$33 trillion]{.underline} in September, [with
interest]{.underline} payments [exceeding fiscal year military program
spending for the first time]{.underline} through August 2023. The IMF
projects that the U.S. economy will grow by just 2.1 percent in 2023 and
1.5 percent in 2024. And [intensifying global efforts to decrease
reliance on the U.S. dollar]{.underline}, although in early stages,
[could **reduce its centrality** over time]{.underline}.

[Washington's military lead]{.underline}, moreover, [is **shrinking** in
the]{.underline} world's most strategically important region, the
[Indo-Pacific, amid]{.underline} a [rapid build-up and
modernization]{.underline} effort [by Beijing]{.underline}. And
[with]{.underline} ongoing [wars in Europe and the Middle East, it's an
**open question** how Washington would manage if another crisis were to
materialize]{.underline} in the Taiwan Strait.

But the credibility crisis ailing the United States results principally
from factors closer to home: its own recent foreign-policy choices and
deepening domestic division and dysfunction.

In the last two decades, [U.S. foreign policy decisions have
**alienated**]{.underline} both traditional U.S. [**allies**
and]{.underline} developing countries in **[the Global
South]{.underline}**. The 2003 invasion of [**Iraq** was especially
damaging]{.underline}, seriously [**eroding global trust** in
Washington. The decision not to enforce the]{.underline} "[red
line]{.underline}" [over chemical weapons]{.underline} use [in
Syria]{.underline} further [undermined U.S.
**cred**ibility]{.underline}. More recently, U.S. [threats to withdraw
from NATO and]{.underline} its [abandonment of the **T**rans-**P**acific
**P**artnership **undercut its reliability**]{.underline} as both a
strategic and commercial partner.

[Because **cred**ibility is **context-specific**]{.underline}, however,
[different countries can draw different conclusions]{.underline} about
the same policies. [When the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan]{.underline}
in 2021, for instance, [many]{.underline} commentators and policymakers
[saw it as a massive hit]{.underline} to U.S. credibility. Yet [others
suggested]{.underline} that the [withdrawal could bolster U.S.
credibility]{.underline} elsewhere [by signaling]{.underline} that
[Washington was serious about reorienting its foreign
policy]{.underline}. U.S. military, humanitarian, and financial aid to
Ukraine and wide-ranging [sanctions on Russia]{.underline}, moreover,
[bolstered]{.underline} Washington's [credibility with]{.underline} many
[advanced industrial democracies while leading some]{.underline}
countries [in the Global South to conclude]{.underline} that [U.S.
policymakers prioritize European over non-Western
interests]{.underline}.

But [the most serious factor undermining U.S. **cred**ibility may
be]{.underline} what Kennan called the "**[problems of its internal
life]{.underline}**." In recent years, [the **U**nited **S**tates'
society and political system have become increasingly **divided** and
dysfunctional. Life expectancy has declined as income inequality has
grown]{.underline}, and many indicators point to increasing
polarization: [public trust in the]{.underline} U.S. [federal government
is at **record lows**]{.underline}, nearly [two-thirds of
**Dem**ocrat**s** and Republicans believe]{.underline} that members of
[the opposite party are more dishonest and immoral]{.underline} than
other Americans, [and a small but growing number of
Americans]{.underline}---[on both sides]{.underline} of the
aisle---[believe]{.underline} that [political violence can be
justified]{.underline}. After Jan. 6, 2021, the United States no longer
has an uninterrupted history of peaceful transfers of power.

[Small pockets of the country are]{.underline} also [**driv**ing **big
political swings**. Fewer swing states and districts mean]{.underline}
that [members of Congress have **fewer incentives to
compromise**]{.underline}, and [control of the executive]{.underline}
branch [depends on the same narrow group]{.underline} of swing states.
[This results in **foreign-policy volatility** in the White House
and]{.underline} partisan [gridlock on Capitol Hill, with
Congress]{.underline} regularly slowing or **[blocking
appointments]{.underline}** and confirmations. One recent example makes
the point: when Hamas launched its brutal terrorist attacks on Israel on
Oct. 7, the United States had no speaker of the House and no confirmed
ambassadors in Israel, Egypt, Oman, or Kuwait.

Mounting evidence makes clear that [domestic politics have **eroded**
the United States' **global cred**ibility]{.underline}. U.S. [allies in
Europe fear]{.underline} that [American support for]{.underline} both
[Ukraine and NATO will shift with the domestic political
winds]{.underline}. Many of [Washington's]{.underline} traditional
[partners in the Middle East are]{.underline} growing [**skeptical**
about long-term U.S. commitments, prompting some to
increase]{.underline} economic and even military [ties with
China]{.underline}. And [in the Indo-Pacific, **even staunch U.S. allies
worry about Washington's reliability**. U.S. adversaries]{.underline},
for their part, seek to [exploit]{.underline} its [polarization through
influence and intelligence **op**eration**s**]{.underline}.

While the United States remains the world's leading power and retains a
great deal of international goodwill, [Washington's allies are **less
sure** of its leadership]{.underline}, its [competitors are **more
emboldened**]{.underline}, and [countries in the middle are
**increasingly hedging their bets**]{.underline}.

## Impact\-\--Germany

### Germany\-\--U\-\--2AC

#### Germany relations are [low]{.underline}.

In recent months, [tensions between the United States and Germany have
**escalated**]{.underline} -- not through military standoffs or
diplomatic spats, [but via **economic pressure**]{.underline}. With
President Donald Trump back in office, [Washington has taken a **sharp
turn** in its **foreign policy**]{.underline}, and Germany is feeling
the heat.

It seems as if the U.S. is consciously weakening Germany's position.
[Washington has imposed new **reciprocal tariffs** that
disproportionately affect Germany's export-heavy economy]{.underline}.
As Germany's trade surplus with the U.S. hit €70 billion in 2024, these
tariffs are now threatening to reverse that trend.

[President Donald Trump informed that he has negotiated an agreement
with **NATO**]{.underline} for the United States to supply weapons to
Ukraine through the alliance. [He emphasized that NATO will cover the
**entire cost** of these weapons]{.underline}.

"We are dispatching weapons to NATO, and NATO will finance these weapons
entirely," the president stated during a phone interview with NBC News'
Kristen Welker.

It should be said [that a decision to supply weapons to Ukraine at the
**expense** of **Europe**]{.underline} and, first of all, [Germany will
be really a **great burden** for Berlin]{.underline}.

Trump's decision to [halt arms deliveries to Ukraine free of charge has
rattled **Germany**]{.underline}, [which remains committed to supporting
**Kyiv**]{.underline}. [This move has strained **NATO unity** and
left]{.underline} leading European nation -- **[Germany]{.underline}**,
[scrambling to **fill the gap**]{.underline}.

Public opinion in Germany has soured. [Only **one in six Germans** now
view the U.S. as a **trustworthy partner**]{.underline}, [and
**three-quarters** believe NATO members can't rely on **American
protection**]{.underline}.

Moreover, analysts warn that Germany may face a third consecutive year
of recession. Exports to the U.S. dropped by nearly 14% year-over-year,
and insolvencies are climbing to a ten-year high.

Thus, [the U.S. pulling back from its traditional leadership role in
**Europe**]{.underline}, [Germany is being forced to **rethink its
alliances**]{.underline} and economic strategies. Calls for a European
military alliance are gaining traction. The time has come for Germany to
choose itself instead of being part of any alliance under US leadership.

There was no horse-drawn carriage ride or banquet at Windsor Castle, as
during last week's state visit of President Emmanuel Macron of France.
[But when Chancellor Friedrich **Merz** and Prime Minister Keir
**Starmer** signed a **landmark defense treaty** on
Thursday]{.underline}, [it added another layer to a portrait of Europe
uniting against **foreign threats**]{.underline}.

The Anglo-German accord, known as the Kensington Treaty, pledges that
[both countries will]{.underline} "[assist one another, including by
military means, in case of an **armed attack** on the **other**." That
echoed language adopted by **Britain** and **France**]{.underline},
which agreed after Mr. Macron's visit last week to more closely
coordinate their nuclear arsenals in responding to threats against
European allies.

[The accord is further evidence of how European leaders are **pulling
together** to confront a landscape scrambled by President
**Trump's**]{.underline} "**[America First]{.underline}**" foreign
policy and President Vladimir V. Putin's relentless assault on Ukraine.

In addition to defense and security, [the treaty covers **energy**,
**economic cooperation** and **migration**]{.underline}. It builds on an
agreement signed last October, under which the countries agreed to
conduct joint military exercises and develop sophisticated weapons.

[Mr. Merz, a center-right leader who came to power in May, has swiftly
emerged as a **linchpin** in Europe's effort to build a more
**independent role in** its security since the return of Mr. Trump to
the **White House**]{.underline}. Mr. Starmer, who welcomed Mr. Merz to
10 Downing Street, has likewise tried to position Britain as a critical
player in European support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.

"[We see the scale of the challenges our continent faces today and we
intend to meet them **head on**]{.underline}," said Mr. Starmer,
standing next to Mr. Merz at an Airbus space and defense factory in
Hertfordshire, north of London.

#### Trump will ruin alliance with Germany

Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump was elected president of the
United States [in November 2024]{.underline}, the [German state-owned
news service Deutsche Welle]{.underline} [published an article with the
headline "Trump's election victory is a nightmare for
Germany."]{.underline} A few hours later, Germany's chancellor, Olaf
Scholz, announced that his three-party political coalition had
collapsed. Disagreements about how to help strengthen Germany's weak
economy were a major factor, [but Scholz mentioned that the U.S.
election outcome also fueled the coalition breaking up.]{.underline} One
month later, Scholz lost a confidence vote, ending the government he has
led since 2021. Germany will have federal elections on Feb. 23, 2025.
[Germany is considered one of the United States' closest allies in
Western Europe,]{.underline} partnering on everything from economic
trade to military defense. [But this might change with Trump returning
to office]{.underline}. As Angela Merkel, the longtime former chancellor
of Germany, said in November 2024, the looming second T[rump presidency
"is a challenge to the world, especially for multilateralism." Indeed,
Trump's U.S.-centric approach to international affairs runs counter to
multilateralism, which is the idea that different countries working
together helps everyone involved. As someone who researches
German-American relations in the 20th century, I share German
politicians' worries that the incoming Trump administration poses a
serious threat to the relationship. The German concerns include Trump
potentially launching a tariff-induced trade war, as well as the
possibility of the president-elect withdrawing financial and military
support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Both scenarios would
further hurt the weak German economy]{.underline} -- especially since,
following the U.S. and the European Union, [Germany is the third-largest
donor to Ukraine and would be required to shoulder even more of this
financial support if the U.S. stopped giving Ukraine money. German
politicians also remain dumbfounded by Trump's particular style of
politics, despite the fact that he already served as
president.]{.underline} Merkel wrote in her 2024 memoir "Freedom:
Memoirs 1954-2021" that when she first met Trump in 2017, she acted as
though she were having a conversation with "someone completelyünormal."
[Merkel quickly realized, though, that Trump was not like other American
politicians. She observed that Trump seemed to think all countries
competed and the success of one meant the failure of
another.]{.underline}

#### Even if not Trump, Vance will cause a break up. Bro got friend zoned.

And yet, [there were some signs that U.S.-German relations are not what
they used to be.]{.underline} One came from Karl Freller, a member of
the Christian Social Union (CSU) of Bavaria, the ruling party in the
southern German state. [Freller]{.underline}, who is also the director
of the Bavarian Memorial Foundation, emphasized in his speech that
weapons were needed to liberate the Dachau concentration camp, [in what
was likely a reference to the Trump Administration's reluctance to keep
arming Ukraine. U.S.-German relations have been in crisis at least since
February 2025, when U.S. Vice-President J.D. Vance visited Germany for
the Munich Security Conference.]{.underline} Two days after paying a
visit to the former Dachau concentration camp with his family, [Vance
addressed the foreign leaders assembled at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in
central Munich.]{.underline} [The Vice President accused Europe of
retreating "from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with
the United States of America"]{.underline} and admonished German
political leaders for isolating groups like the far-right Alternative
für Deutschland (AfD) from government offices. [Then-German chancellor
Olaf Scholz replied by noting that the AfD has been guilty of
relativizing the Nazi cruelties Vance had seen evidence of in
Dachau.]{.underline} One such example is that high-ranking members of
the AfD have said that "Hitler and the Nazis are just bird shit in more
than 1,000 years of successful German history" and advocated for a
180-degree change in the way Germany deals with its Nazi past. In the
February 2025 general elections, the AfD finished in second place for
the first time in the party's history, garnering nearly 21 percent of
the vote. [The impact of Vance's speech only intensified when foreign
leaders realized in the coming days that the Trump Administration
planned to sideline its European partners in its efforts to put an end
to the Ukraine War.]{.underline} The shock was felt across Europe,
particularly in [the German mainstream media and political class, which
has close ties to the United States. The conservative Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, for instance, spoke about Vance's address as "a cold
shower for Europe."]{.underline}

### Germany\-\--No Prolif\-\--2AC

#### No German proliferation.

[Two surveys]{.underline}, conducted in early March by pollsters Forsa
and Civey, [showed **31%** and **38%** of Germans were in **favor** of
Germany arming itself with **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. That\'s
still a minority, but has grown by several percentage points compared to
a year ago.

But such [shifts in public opinion are unlikely to have an **impact** on
**policy**]{.underline}, but [it is unclear whether Germany currently
has the **ability** to build its own **nuc**lear weapon**s**
**anyway**]{.underline}.

In an article in early March, the [Wall Street Journal pointed to the
country\'s **small supply** of weapons-grade **uranium** for a civilian
**research reactor**]{.underline} operated by the Technical University
of Munich. The paper concluded that [although Germany may have the
scientific and industrial basis required to **develop**
**weapons**]{.underline}, [it would still need **outside help**, which
it could not ask for or receive as long as it was a member of the
**Treaty** on the **Non-Proliferation** of **Nuclear
Weapons**]{.underline}.

[Germany\'s prospective new chancellor has **rejected** such
speculation]{.underline}. [Germany]{.underline} \"[**cannot** and **must
not** have its own **nuclear weapons**]{.underline},\" Merz told news
agency dpa on March 9. Ge[rmany has]{.underline} \"[expressly
**renounced** the **possession** of **nuclear weapons**, and that will

Accessed 7.16.24\]

[We find these arguments **unconvincing** and
**overdrawn**]{.underline}. For political, military, and economic
reasons, [there's a stronger case for Germany to avoid any serious moves
toward developing its own **nuclear deterrent**]{.underline}. While
debates over Germany's nuclear status regularly occur whenever there is
an apparent shift in European or American attitudes toward nuclear
deterrence, [there are simply **too many ob**stacles to Germany taking
such a **provocative** **step**]{.underline}.

International and Domestic Barriers Should Hold

Both international and domestic political constraints on Berlin remain
essentially in place. [Internationally, the West is committed to
**preserving** the]{.underline} **[NPT]{.underline}**, given concerns
about North Korea and Iran's intent to develop such weapons. [As an NPT
signatory, Germany's decision to exit the treaty would essentially
destroy long-standing **Western solidarity**]{.underline} and encourage
additional nuclear proliferation. As most scholars of German politics
have recognized, post-1945 [Germany has felt most secure when it placed
its foreign and security policies squarely within a broader Western
**security structure**]{.underline}. Germany's military, for example, is
embedded into the NATO military structure---a [unique condition made
obligatory for **West Germany** to be rearmed and join the alliance in
**1955**]{.underline}. And, [its conventional forces are ultimately
under the control of NATO's **supreme allied commander**]{.underline},
always a senior U.S. military leader. So, Germany would either have to
place its nuclear weapons under U.S./NATO control or exit the alliance
itself---the latter of which is more likely to undermine Europe's
security architecture than anything Putin has done. Moreover, [Russia's
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} may have shaken Europe's security
environment, but it [has solidified the **transatlantic alliance** and
its **resolve**, **not weakened it**]{.underline}.

[Domestically, the politics of **nuclear weapons** has **not changed**
as much as Szabo suggests]{.underline}. That some Christian Democratic
security experts believe that there needs to be a debate is not new.
Former President Donald Trump's threats to soften the U.S. commitment to
the NATO treaty's Article V on collective defense did spawn speculation.
But in 2021, the current German coalition government parties were
debating the merits of exiting NATO's nuclear sharing and some coalition
leaders wanted to press the United States to remove the few remaining
U.S. nuclear weapons in Germany in line with German public opinion. Fast
forward to post-Ukraine invasion, and public opinion had shifted
dramatically in favor of retaining U.S. weapons. This does not suggest
that Germans are worried about a weakened U.S. commitment or a hankering
for its own forces. Needless to say, the public's attitudes are
changeable depending on the perception of the nuclear risks that Berlin
faces. The Biden administration's forceful pledges to defend "every
inch" of NATO territory and its sizable arms transfers to a non-NATO
member like Ukraine suggest a comforted German public.

The argument that Germany might skirt the provocative move toward an
independent nuclear force by pressing the French to extend their nuclear
deterrence to Germany seems to us a bridge too far. The French Force de
frappe has long been seen as an independent nuclear force designed to
retain Paris's freedom of action as well as complicate Moscow's own
nuclear targeting plans. In fact, flagging German confidence in the
United States suggested by proponents of a German or European nuclear
option is not borne out by recent opinion polls; in June 2022, strong
majorities in most countries---including Germany---viewed the United
States as a reliable partner. At this juncture, Berlin has no reason to
question Washington's reliability.

Reality Check: Technologically Feasible, but Costly, Demanding, and
Risky

[The **technical**, **economic**, and **military** challenges of
creating and maintaining a viable nuclear capability]{.underline} add to
the political arguments against a German nuclear program.

To be sure, Germany would have several options to create fissionable
material for warheads---all of which are technically feasible. Berlin
could retain its civilian nuclear reactors (extended for now during the
Ukraine War) and use them to produce plutonium for warheads. This path
would require substantial plutonium reprocessing capabilities, a task
well within the country's capability. Using commercial reactors would be
the least expensive and fastest option for Berlin. Alternatively,
Germany could build devoted plutonium-producing reactors at a cost of
billions of dollars. This more expensive route would delink the
commercial and military programs but provide a rallying point against
the effort and become one of the highest priority Russian targets for
technical (including cyber sabotage) and military countermeasures.

Berlin could instead opt for uranium-based weapons and create stocks of
weapons-grade Uranium-235 through centrifuge enrichment. Building
cascades of centrifuges is a major, lengthy, and costly industrial
enterprise, but again well within Berlin's technical capability. Turning
weapons-grade Plutonium-239 or Uranium-235 into viable warheads is not
trivial. However, the greater challenge for Berlin would arise as it
tries to convert a stockpile of nuclear warheads into a credible nuclear
strike capability. The research, development, production, and force
integration efforts would cost many billions of euros and take years if
not a decade or more.

Three days after Russia's attack on Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz
announced an enormous rearmament program, including spending an
additional 100 billion euros, or roughly twice the country's annual
defense budget. The weapon systems proposed for purchase, such as F-35
fighter jets, along with recapitalizing a military that has been
short-changed for many years, will consume this plus-up. A nuclear
program on roughly the same scale as France's might cost an additional
several billion euros per year, after much larger initial R&D and
procurement costs. As the French and British see with their aging
delivery systems, replacing submarines and missiles is shockingly
expensive.

[No German nuclear capability **makes military sense**]{.underline}, or
can be rationally constructed, [without a clear concept of its
**fundamental purpose.**]{.underline} In the most general sense, nuclear
weapons can be used to threaten a potential enemy's warfighting
capabilities (its own nuclear or conventional strike capabilities, such
as missiles and aircraft bases, army garrisons, military ports, and
command and control facilities) or its civilians (populations, economic
centers, and infrastructure). In general, the former---counter-force
capabilities---are intended to limit the damage an enemy can inflict in
its own strike and reduce its conventional capabilities. The
latter---counter-value capabilities---are credible only as brutal
punishment for aggression---and of necessity hold civilians at risk.

A [German counter-force capability against Russia would demand a
**colossal expansion** of its military and development of
**new**]{.underline}, **[expensive]{.underline}**, [and **technically
challenging** systems]{.underline}. The potential Russian target set of
bases and forces is vast and distant. Although aircraft could strike
some targets as a signal of resolve early in an escalatory phase, [such
delivery systems would not provide the near-certainty of **delivery**,
**speed**, and **accuracy** required for a **counter-force posture** to
deter enemy actions]{.underline}.

A counter-value capability would be less demanding, but not trivial.
Aircraft might suffice, but unless used early in a conflict---defeating
the very purpose of this capability as a fundamental deterrent---German
planners would have to assume that Russia would effectively strike
German airbases during a conventional phase of a war.

There is a commonly held perception that the mere possession of nuclear
weapons generates deterrence. Military planners and analysts recognize
that numbers and types of warheads, delivery systems, targeting
capabilities, command and control, employment doctrine, training,
warning and alert systems, and many other components of a nuclear
capability together create a viable nuclear posture. But all of these
must be considered in the context of potential opponents and their
possible counteractions.

Ber[lin would almost certainly have to develop a submarine-based
missile-borne nuclear capability to create **any semblance** of
**credible deterrence**]{.underline}. An alternative land-based system
would invite Russian planners to prepare for terribly destructive,
preemptive nuclear strikes for their own damage-limitation approach. It
is hard to imagine that the German populace would find such a
possibility, fueled by Berlin's own actions, acceptable. In contrast,
submarine-based missiles would be more survivable and still have
remarkable accuracy. However, [the scale of Russian target
sets]{.underline}---their number, character, and distances---[would call
for a very large submarine force for a **counter-force
posture**]{.underline}. [Submarines in port are tempting targets and
would provide little more value than **aircraft** on]{.underline}
**[bases]{.underline}**. [Submarines and their crews demand rotations
for **rest** and **refit**]{.underline}, [and countries have found that
they can keep perhaps **one-third** of their fleet at sea at **any
time**]{.underline}. Once a planner does the math---the number of
targets, the number of missiles to raise the confidence of destruction,
the number of missiles per submarine---the total fleet size soars.
Moreover, command and control arrangements to guarantee that weapons
would not be used unless ordered by the government, and would be used if
ordered, represents a key vulnerability. Russian planners would be
foolish not to devote efforts to hinder, delay, corrupt, or defeat
German nuclear use authorization. These could take extremely destructive
forms, including "decapitation" strikes to eliminate government and
military leaders.

In practice, a counter-value posture is the most Germany could
militarily afford or operate, perhaps no larger than the French or
British arsenals of 200-300 warheads each. All [things considered, the
costs and **operational constraints** would argue for a German nuclear
arsenal aimed at killing millions of Russians rather than defanging the
huge **Russian nuclear force**]{.underline}. [How tolerable would this
be to **Russians** or the **German public**? **Not very**, in our
opinion]{.underline}.

presidential candidate Donald Trump indicating that if he is re-elected
Washington wouldn't come to the aid of NATO allies that weren't spending
enough on defense.

In an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Lindner asked:
"Under which political and financial conditions would Paris and London
be willing to maintain and expand their own strategic capacities for our
collective security? And conversely, how much are we ready to
contribute?"

Other politicians, including Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's largest
opposition party, the conservative CDU, and Katarina Barley, the
center-left SPD's candidate for the European election, have also called
for Germany to seek a European nuclear deterrent independent from the
U.S.

Senior government officials say that Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as well as
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius,
remain skeptical about the prospects for enhanced nuclear cooperation
with France and the U.K. and the usefulness of such an approach.

## Impact\-\--Nuclear Sharing

### Nuclear Sharing\-\--Inevitable\-\--2AC

#### The Northwood Declaration is an [unprecedented move]{.underline} towards nuclear integration.

Atlantic Council, M.A. in European Affairs from Sciences Po, "Reading
between the lines of the new France-UK nuclear entente," Atlantic
Council, 07-16-2025, accessed 07-16-2025,

DG

[**For the first time in more than a decade**, France and the **U**nited
**K**ingdom]{.underline} have [issued a joint nuclear
statement]{.underline}. The Northwood Declaration takes its name from
the British military headquarters northwest of London where French
President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer
announced it on July 10. At that event, Starmer called the declaration
"truly historic," and it very much has the potential to be. But
understanding why requires parsing what's in the document and what it
could mean for French and British nuclear cooperation.

To begin with, [the declaration comes amid a larger debate on nuclear
deterrence in Europe]{.underline} that has emerged [in the wake
of]{.underline} Russia's full-scale war in [Ukraine]{.underline},
including its nuclear dimension. At the same time, [many voices in
Washington are calling for]{.underline} a strategy of "[burden
shifting]{.underline}" to allies [to respond to a]{.underline} "[two
nuclear peer]{.underline}" [environment]{.underline}, thereby setting
the conditions to potentially remove more US conventional military
assets from Europe.

At last month's NATO Summit in The Hague, the United States reiterated
its commitment to Article 5's collective defense and US extended
deterrence pledge to allies, but it did so on the underlying condition
that Europeans take on more of the burden for the deterrence and defense
of the continent. While many of those challenges lie in the conventional
domain, [Europe will]{.underline} also [need to play a role to reinforce
the]{.underline} overall security of the [Alliance]{.underline} and the
continent [to complement the **U**nited **S**tates' extended deterrence
for Europe. As the two nuclear]{.underline}-weapon [states of Europe,
the United Kingdom and France will naturally lead any
evolution]{.underline} in this realm. The Northwood Declaration marks an
important step forward in that leadership.

What's new in the France-UK nuclear declaration?

Since the 1995 Chequers Declaration, the United Kingdom and France have
agreed that they do not envisage "situations arising in which the vital
interests of either" nation "could be threatened without the vital
interest of the other also being threatened." [A major new element of
the Northwood Declaration is an acknowledgement]{.underline} that [there
is]{.underline} "[no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a
response by our two nations]{.underline}." In other words, the statement
is about a common response to a crisis scenario that would bear an
extreme threat to the continent, not just to the two nations. While [the
exact nature of the response is **not stated**]{.underline}, the
document elsewhere notes that "nuclear weapons exist to deter the most
extreme threats." In practice, this could mean that, [from now on, both
countries will anticipate crises and response scenarios in which both
nuclear arsenals are involved **together**]{.underline}. France and
Britain could maximize their nuclear forces' strategic effects by, for
example, envisaging and planning for joint responses, including
potentially targeting an adversary.

Next, the new declaration states that "nuclear forces are independent,
but can be coordinated," an entirely new wording with some potentially
important consequences.

Deterrence is a permanent posture, whereby a potential adversary must be
convinced that use is always a possibility. To establish this certitude,
both countries rely on different doctrines, systems, and policies. Most
relevant here is the divergence between the United Kingdom and France on
the notion of their deterrents' independence, and relatedly, how they
view coordination with other nuclear-armed allies.

It is a cornerstone of France's nuclear policy that its arsenal
"guarantees independence, freedom of appreciation, decision and action."
In practice, this means that France masters nearly all the technical
elements of the oceanic and air-based components of its deterrent force
and remains outside of NATO's nuclear planning. But its deterrent is
nonetheless "contributing to the overall strengthening of the deterrence
of the Alliance."

Conversely, the United Kingdom, while retaining full operational control
over its use, relies on extensive technical cooperation with the United
States on multiple aspects of its oceanic nuclear force, especially the
acquisition of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Since 1962, London
has committed its forces to NATO nuclear planning as "membership \[to
the Alliance\] sits at the heart of UK policy." During the latest NATO
Summit, the United Kingdom joined NATO's dual-capable aircraft nuclear
mission, which further anchored London's nuclear policy within NATO.

In the new declaration, [France and the **U**nited **K**ingdom have
agreed to potentially coordinate their permanent nuclear
postures]{.underline}. Importantly, [this does not mean]{.underline}
[that they will relinquish the sovereignty of their nuclear
decision-making]{.underline}. In practice, [one of the first areas of
coordination could be]{.underline} nuclear-powered ballistic-missile
submarine ([SSBN]{.underline}) [patrols. Since both]{.underline}
countries [have]{.underline} a policy of [continuous at-sea deterrence,
Paris and London could do a lot more together]{.underline}, starting
with [sharing intelligence, as well as signaling by]{.underline}, for
example, [coordinating port calls]{.underline}. They could also assign
conventional assets to assist each other, such as protecting the SSBNs
or tracking Russian anti-submarine warfare assets in the moments before
the submarine becomes untraceable in the ocean's depths.

In anticipating scenarios of an "extreme threat to Europe,"
[coordination could go all the way to targeting]{.underline}. Further,
the United Kingdom could participate in French air-based nuclear
exercises. British forces could, for instance, participate in the French
strategic air force's "Poker" quarterly exercises, which simulate a
large-scale mission of the air leg of the French nuclear dyad, by
providing escort or tanker aircraft. Italy has already assigned
conventional means to a "Poker" exercise, by contributing a tanker
aircraft in 2022. With the Royal Air Force decision to return to a
nuclear mission, even more options could be considered at a later stage.

[The overall effect of the Northwood Declaration is]{.underline} that
[it brings the **U**nited **K**ingdom and France closer to one another.
Paris is expanding the European dimension of its vital interests,
stating]{.underline} that [its arsenal can be]{.underline}
"[**coordinated** and **contribute significantly to the overall security
of the Alliance**]{.underline}." [This builds on France's long-standing
policy]{.underline} that [its vital interests extend beyond its national
borders]{.underline}: "Since 1964, \[the French nuclear deterrent\] has
played a clear role in the preservation of peace and security in
Europe," as Macron said in a national address in March. For its part,
London is reinforcing the European dimension of its deterrent, as the
declaration states that British nuclear forces protect against "extreme
threats to Europe." This is a much stronger statement than the bilateral
2009 joint statement, which said that British "nuclear forces contribute
to European security as a whole."

Finally, the declaration states that [both countries will create a
Nuclear Steering Group to]{.underline} "[coordinate across nuclear
policy, capabilities and operations]{.underline}." Led by the presidency
of the French Republic and the UK Cabinet Office, the dialogue will
facilitate the implementation of the Northwood Declaration. Since 1992,
a Joint Nuclear Commission on policies and doctrines has convened
regularly at the political level to discuss areas of mutual interests,
shared perspectives, and strategies on competitors. This Commission
comes on top of military-to-military staff talks. But this newly
announced steering group marks an important upgrade. It is likely, for
example, to include cooperation on technical aspects, pursuing the
existing cooperation dating back to the 2010 Lancaster House Treaty. At
the Epure facility in France, both countries conduct tests to underwrite
the reliability and safety of their nuclear warheads. On a political as
much as on a technical level, increased site visits and exchanges could
signal the depth of the new nuclear entente to potential adversaries.

What does the entente mean for transatlantic relations?

[For the United States, the Northwood Declaration is a **clear
signal**]{.underline} that [the **U**nited **K**ingdom and France are
taking **unprecedented steps** on their own to strengthen the defense
and deterrence capabilities of Europe and the Alliance.
Both]{.underline} sides [are **managing to avoid a transatlantic
crisis** over the US]{.underline} "[burden shifting]{.underline}"
[posture, while **creating the conditions for a more strategically
autonomous Europe**]{.underline} to emerge.

Foremost a form of "complementary guarantee," this new declaration also
has value in what it means for Russia. [The Kremlin will]{.underline}
almost [certainly view these developments in the nuclear realm in the
context of broader Franco-British leadership in the conventional
domain]{.underline}, whether on building a "Coalition of the Willing" to
support Ukraine, joint contributions to NATO's multinational battlegroup
in Estonia, or reinforcing their mutual defense industrial base.

[French and British coordination]{.underline}---from day-to-day
operations up to extreme threats for which nuclear arsenals are
involved---[is something]{.underline} that [Moscow will]{.underline} now
[need to factor in]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir Putin
condemned Macron's national address in March, which reiterated that
France's vital interests have a European dimension. The Russian leader
would prefer for the Alliance's nuclear-weapon states to maintain
conservative visions of deterrence that would not evolve from their
current makeup. Having to deal with a reinforced NATO nuclear policy,
and now British and French coordination, complicates the calculus of any
nuclear-armed competitor or adversary, Russia included. Another factor
that Moscow must factor in as well is the parallel reinforcement of
trilateral US, French, and British "coordination on strategic
activities, deterrence messaging, and threat assessments," as Pentagon
official John Hill explained to the US House in April.

The United States should welcome the further opening of a debate on
nuclear deterrence among Europeans. Indeed, [the UK and French
deterrents **cannot replicate what the U**nited **S**tates is offering
under]{.underline} its [extended deterrence]{.underline} pledge, [given
the smaller scope and size of these countries' nuclear
forces]{.underline}. While the NATO Nuclear Planning Group has become an
important acculturation mechanism, especially for nations with
dual-capable aircraft, it is a natural development for some discussions
to also occur outside of NATO formats.

Europe has long lacked a common strategic culture, and [there lies the
impetus for France to explain its doctrine and develop new dialogue
formats among Europeans. A European]{.underline} "[nuclear
grammar]{.underline}" [is needed as European states come to better
understand the French and British nuclear deterrent forces and reflect
on the conventional strengths and complementarity they can bring to
European security architecture]{.underline}.

[The US Air Force practice of deploying nuclear weapons on military
bases **in other countries**]{.underline} --- [and **training foreign**
pilots to attack third countries with **H-bombs**]{.underline} --- [is
called]{.underline} '[**nuclear** sharing']{.underline} or '**[forward
basing]{.underline}**.' The [system has been **repeatedly**
**condemned**]{.underline} in recent years by lawyer's groups,
international law experts, UN delegates, civil society, and foreign
affairs offices from around the world.

T[he US currently stations around 100 of its B61 thermonuclear gravity
bombs in **Germany**]{.underline}, **[Belgium]{.underline}**,
**[Italy]{.underline}**, [**Holland** and]{.underline}
**[Turkey]{.underline}**. [It may soon **station more** in
England]{.underline}. All six plus the US have ratified the 1970 Treaty
on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). International
criticism was directed at Russia when it moved some of its H-bombs into
Belarus in 2023. [Little attention has been paid to the clear and
authoritative condemnation of the transfer of US to Europe that has
**only increased** in recent years]{.underline}.

Critiques of US nukes stationed in Europe are based on the
nonproliferation treaty's first two articles. The Lawyers Committee on
Nuclear Policy, explained the violation in a July 25, 2023 working
paper, submitted to the UN's 11th Review Conference for NPT:

"The incompatibility of nuclear sharing with the NPT is based on a
straightforward application of NPT Articles I and II. Article I requires
NPT nuclear-armed states 'not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever
nuclear weapons ... or control over such weapons directly, or
indirectly.' It further requires the nuclear-armed states 'not in any
way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to ...
acquire nuclear weapons or control over such weapons.' (emphasis added)
Article II imposes the corollary obligation on NPT non-nuclear weapon
states not to be the recipient of any such transfer or assistance.

"These provisions should be read in light of NPT Review Conference
commitments made subsequent to the 1995 decision to indefinitely extend
the NPT. ... The 2000 Final Document, 'reaffirms that the strict
observance of the provisions of the Treaty remains central to achieving
the shared objectives of preventing, under any circumstances, the
further proliferation of nuclear weapons and preserving the Treaty's
vital contribution to peace and security."

The International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms (German
section) in an April 5, 2023 submission to the UN Human Rights Council
said: "...the [components of **technical** **nuclear sharing** together
with Germany's participation in **operational planning** in NATO's
Nuclear Planning Group under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties, constitute a **violation** of the **spirit** and
**purpose** of the NPT]{.underline}."

As early as 2019, Bruno Tertrais---one of France's foremost nuclear
strategists---discussed such an arrangement. Mindful of the obstacles,
he also debunked some of the most common criticisms. For example, even
combined, [the limited French and U.K. arsenals would not be a full
substitute for U.S. extended deterrence based on an arsenal many times
that size.]{.underline} But **[that does not mean that a France- or
U.K.-based deterrent would not be credible]{.underline}**, per se. As
Tertrais argued, "[a small arsenal can deter a major power provided that
it has the ability to inflict damage seen as unacceptable]{.underline}
by the other party."

[It is]{.underline} also [**unconvincing** to claim]{.underline} that a
[focus on Europeanizing nuclear deterrence distracts from]{.underline}
the necessary investments in [conventional deterrence]{.underline}
(including deep precision-strike capabilities). Tertrais contended that
**[Europeans simply need to pursue both]{.underline}**. And yes, the
U.K. does rely on Washington for key elements of its own nuclear
arsenal. But the [French capabilities are fully autonomous, which is
crucial]{.underline} for credibility in light of a possible U.S. turn
against Europe.

[To claim]{.underline} that [a push to Europeanize nuclear sharing would
incentivize nuclear proliferation globally **seems
far-fetched**]{.underline}. [South Korea, Saudi Arabia, or Turkey will
**make their own determinations**]{.underline} about going nuclear
[based on their own assessments of their security
situations]{.underline}. And in the medium and long term, Germany and
Europe also need to think about arms control and confidence-building
measures with Russia.

The reboot will deepen our longstanding and resolute commitment to
cooperation on nuclear deterrence. Since 1995, we have stated that we do
not see situations arising in which the vital interests of one could be
threatened without the vital interests of the other also being
threatened. Thirty years on, [the **Northwood
Declaration**]{.underline}, signed by the Prime Minister and the
President at the 2025 UK-France Summit, [states for the first time that
our respective deterrents are **independent**]{.underline}, [but can be
**coordinated**]{.underline}, and that there is no extreme threat to
Europe that would not prompt a response by our two nations. Any
adversary threatening the vital interests of our nations should know
that they could be confronted by the combined strength of the nuclear
forces of both nations.

[The UK and France will improve coordination across defence **nuclear**
**policy**, **capabilities** and operations, and strengthen our ability
to make joint decisions if **needed**]{.underline}. We will also deepen
co-operation on nuclear research and technology, building on the 2010
Teutates Treaty. A new UK-France Nuclear Steering Board will be
established to provide political direction for our collaboration. Both
the UK and France remain committed to Article V of the North-Atlantic
Treaty and are dedicated to burden sharing on wider nuclear deterrence.
[Only the **Prime** **Minister** can authorise the use of the **UK's
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. The [UK's strategic nuclear forces
remain fully operationally **independent** and
**sovereign**]{.underline}, but we are able to coordinate with France
should the situation demand it. Our deterrent remains declared to the
defence of NATO. [We remain committed to our obligations under the

disarmament**, and to the long-term goal of achieving a world **without

First, [a US withdrawal from Europe is **extremely
improbable**]{.underline}. To be sure, the transatlantic partners face
numerous challenges as a result of China's rise, the growing strength of
isolationist and populist forces in the United States and various
economic, technological and regulatory tensions. But [Washington's
response to]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline} war [has made
clear]{.underline} that [the **U**nited **S**tates will **maintain its
commitment**]{.underline} to European security for the time being. And
[in the medium to long term, neither the Europeans nor the
Americans]{.underline} seem to **[have]{.underline}** many
**[alternatives]{.underline}**. In order to be able [to carry on
pursuing its global]{.underline} political, military and economic
[interests, Washington will continue to **depend on coop**eration with
key **Europe**an states]{.underline}. For their part, [most European
states would **rather have the U**nited **S**tates ensure the
continent's security]{.underline} and contain Russia's ambitions.

[Even a US government determined to reduce the cost of its]{.underline}
European [commitments would]{.underline} likely [abandon extended
nuclear deterrence **only if it wanted to fully disengage from all its
global commitments**. Washington has long urged Europeans to invest more
in their defence]{.underline}. But [its main gripe is the lack
of]{.underline} European [**conventional forces**. With regard to
nuclear deterrence, the **U**nited **S**tates still has considerable
comparative advantages]{.underline}. While it will have to further
modernize and expand its nuclear capabilities in the face of a resurgent
Russia and a China expanding its nuclear arsenal, Washington already has
a large and diversified nuclear arsenal of its own -- one that is much
better suited for extended deterrence than anything France or Europe
could offer in the short or even medium term.

[A future US president who questioned Washington's security guarantees
**even more than**]{.underline} Donald [**Trump** would likely generate
increased interest in **complementary security mechanisms**]{.underline}
among many Europeans. However, [based on the Europeans' reactions to
Trump's policies, it is **unlikely**]{.underline} that [they would be
prompted]{.underline} by such a stance [to make a **serious effort** to
push alternative options, such as a French nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}.

Second, it is impossible to predict how the security situation in Europe
will evolve and how Eurasian relations might change [in the event of a
complete US withdrawal]{.underline} from the European order. On the one
hand, Russia's revisionist ambitions could force European nations to
compromise on conflicting political, economic and security objectives in
order to establish a credible deterrent against Moscow. On the other
hand, [it is just as plausible]{.underline} that [France, Italy or
Germany might be inclined to adopt a more **coop**erative approach
towards Russia as a result of US retrenchment]{.underline}.

Both the [pursuit of French extended nuclear deterrence and]{.underline}
the path of [unilateral proliferation confront **severe technical
challenges**]{.underline}, many of which a centrally coordinated United
States of Europe would be far better positioned to address or avoid
altogether. By [vesting the leader of its central government with
control over a unified]{.underline} Franco-British nuclear
[arsenal]{.underline}, such a state [could adopt a limited nuclear
deterrence posture which]{.underline}, when combined with significant
conventional capabilities and weaker transatlantic ties,
[might]{.underline} plausibly [succeed]{.underline} in reassuring those
citizens living closer to Russia's border that deterring nuclear
coercion remained credible. Ultimately, this central government's very
legitimacy would rest on its ability to defend the entire territory of
the new state, thereby granting its leadership the necessary credibility
to sustain such a deterrence posture.

However, **[the degree of centralization required]{.underline}** for
such a United States of Europe **[would demand a level of integration
that most European nations regard as illusory]{.underline}** within the
coming decades. Currently, [political, economic, and security goals vary
**so fundamentally** across Europe]{.underline}---[shaped by historical
legacies, divergent threat perceptions, and competing national
priorities]{.underline}---[that **no polity appears willing to shoulder
the political sacrifices or financial burdens required to achieve
lasting agreement**]{.underline} on shared positions. [While Europe's
unity on trade matters often impresses]{.underline} observers across the
Atlantic, it is important to note that [the continent has **struggled**
to share the costs of averting economic recessions, has yet to implement
meaningful decisions to collectively shoulder]{.underline} even
[moderate portions of the burden of rearmament, and includes states like
**Austria and Ireland**, who are firmly opposed to nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}.

### No Nuclear Sharing\-\--1AR

#### France is bluffing and would never go beyond the status quo.

cannot rely on French nuclear umbrella alone," Financial Times,

French President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} has [invited fellow
European leaders to discuss whether]{.underline} --- and how ---
[his]{.underline} country's nuclear [arsenal could be used as a
deterrent]{.underline} against future Russian aggression.

But his **[allies may not like the limitations he may]{.underline}**
choose to **[keep on the force]{.underline}** de frappe.

[The idea of extending the French]{.underline} "[nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}" to protect other European countries [has taken on
new urgency as]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline} has **[undermined
Nato]{.underline}** and threatened to abandon the role the US has played
as Europe's ultimate security guarantor since the second world war.

"There was never any request from a European country for such a thing
since none ever wanted to question the US support," said Hubert Védrine,
a former French foreign minister who worked on his country's nuclear
doctrine.

"The debate now starting takes us into uncharted territory and it will
be very hard to resolve."

As well as the vast arsenal stored in the US, America's nuclear umbrella
includes over 100 gravity bombs stationed in Europe. These are under
American control but according to a "nuclear sharing" agreement within
Nato are designed to be carried and dropped by fighter jets flown by
Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.

No one in Europe wants the US to withdraw its nuclear guarantee, but the
fear is such that the leaders of two staunchly Atlanticist countries ---
Germany and Poland --- recently said that preparations for such a
scenario must begin.

Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor-in-waiting, asked for talks over
whether "nuclear security from the UK and France could also apply to
us". Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk welcomed the idea, and even said
Poland should consider getting the bomb itself. Lithuania and Latvia
also said they were interested in the French offer.

In response, Macron offered to "open the strategic debate" with
interested European countries that would last several months to
determine "if there are new co-operations that may emerge".

[France has for decades said its]{.underline} "[vital
interests]{.underline}" --- the factors that determine the use of
nuclear weapons --- [have a]{.underline} "[European
dimension]{.underline}". But [Paris never defined the term]{.underline},
so as [to keep the president's options open and the adversary
guessing]{.underline}, the key to all nuclear deterrence.

The Macron-led talks are expected to also involve the UK, the only other
nuclear-armed power in the region. Given that the UK deterrent is
already assigned to protect Europe through Nato, the onus is on Macron
to show what he is willing or able to do.

**[Even if France wanted to]{.underline}** somehow **[expand nuclear
protection to Europe]{.underline}**, experts say [its arsenal of about
300 warheads]{.underline} --- a fraction of America's 5,000 --- [is
**too small**]{.underline} to protect the whole region. Russia has 5,580
warheads, and has recently moved some to Belarus.

[Paris]{.underline} also [lacks tactical nuclear weapons]{.underline}
--- less powerful, shorter range weapons designed for battlefield use
--- [and has fewer options for gradual escalation]{.underline} than the
US and Russia. If it was under grave threat, it would carry out a
nuclear "warning strike" against an adversary before destroying key
targets like major cities.

[Britain's submarine-based nuclear deterrent]{.underline}, which uses up
to 260 UK designed warheads that are delivered by US-made Trident
missiles, [is assigned to Nato]{.underline}. By contrast Paris --- which
uses French designed and made nuclear weapons --- does not take part in
Nato's Nuclear Planning Group, the forum that co-ordinates the
alliance's nuclear policy.

The simplest and quickest way [for France to strengthen European
deterrence]{.underline} would be for it to join Nato's NPG to commit its
nuclear weapons to collective defence, said Marion Messmer, an
international security expert at Chatham House, the UK think-tank.

It would align French and British nuclear doctrine, integrate planning
and facilitate training for a crisis, Messmer added. To Russia, "it
would signal France's commitment to Europe and show that Nato, a
European Nato, would remain strong even if the US disengages".

However, this [would **overturn a French tradition of nuclear
independence that dates back to**]{.underline} General **[Charles de
Gaulle]{.underline}** who believed the US security promises could not be
trusted. [Macron has repeatedly stressed]{.underline} that [a French
president would **always have ultimate power** to decide whether to use
the bomb]{.underline} --- [the same applies to Britain and the US within
Nato]{.underline}.

Together, British and French nuclear capabilities would at least make
Moscow think twice about attacking, said a senior western official.

However, "[what really influences Russian decision-making is the scale
of US deterrence]{.underline}", he said. [Europe would]{.underline} need
[**at least a decade of spending** at around 6-7 per cent of GDP if it
wanted to emulate that]{.underline} and acquire another 1,000 warheads,
he added.

Short of such a major expansion, France still had options, said former
officials and experts. First among them would be to more clearly spell
out its nuclear doctrine on how it would come to the aid of European
allies, even if this one day limited the president's freedom of action.

Camille Grand, a former senior Nato official who is now at the European
Council on Foreign Relations, said France would have to become more
specific. "If to every question our allies ask, the answer is just trust
us, the French president will act when he sees fit, then we are not
creating something very reassuring for our allies," he said.

[There is precedent for signalling expanded deterrence]{.underline}. In
1995, [Britain and France said]{.underline} in the so-called Chequers
declaration that [they could not see a situation in which]{.underline}
"[the vital interests of either of our two countries]{.underline} . . .
[could be threatened without the vital interests of the other being also
threatened]{.underline}".

One possible scenario now would be a similar statement made with other
allied countries, or perhaps even linked to the EU's mutual defence
clause.

[Another step would be more joint exercises and training]{.underline} to
signal to Russia that European allies were tightly bound. In 2022, an
Italian refuelling aircraft took part in a French nuclear exercise for
the first time. In early March, France hosted Nato ambassadors at the
Istres air force base in southern France so they could learn more about
France's nuclear deterrent.

Bruno Tertrais, a leading expert on nuclear deterrence, wrote in Le
Monde recently that [France could send]{.underline} ["a strong
operational signal]{.underline}" by temporarily deploying Rafale fighter
jets without nuclear warheads to the bases of "our most worried
partners, such as Poland". Paris could also seek to take part in Nato's
nuclear planning group as an observer.

[**Going much further would require a paradigm shift in France's nuclear
strategy and** that **of its European allies**]{.underline} --- one
**[that would not be needed or justified unless the US were to truly
withdraw]{.underline}** from protecting Europe altogether.

Grand, the former Nato official, warned that [it would be a mistake for
Europe to seek to replicate the US nuclear umbrella]{.underline}, or
create "a poor man's version" of it. "We have to collectively invent
something different," he urged.

#### No nuclear sharing\-\--it's too complex and expensive.

landmines: European countries debate their red lines for dealing with
Russia," El País, 04-17-2025, accessed 07-18-2025,

[Replacing the U.S. nuclear shield with a French]{.underline} --- [or
Franco-British]{.underline} --- one [would be a **complex, costly**, and
**obstacle-ridden process**. Atomic weapons]{.underline} from the EU's
sole nuclear power [can only be launched from French-made aircraft or
submarines]{.underline}. And [Macron made it clear]{.underline} that
[the decision]{.underline} to use such weapons "has always been, and
[**will always be**, up to]{.underline} the President and Commander in
Chief of [France]{.underline}."

Cédric Perrin, chairman of the French Senate's Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, proposed that European allies interested in expanding
France's nuclear deterrent contribute to the costs of maintaining
France's nuclear arsenal, which in 2024 will exceed €5.8 billion.

Unlike France, [the United Kingdom's nuclear forces **rely heavily on
the U**nited **S**tates for weapons design, manufacturing, and
maintenance]{.underline}. Furthermore, [its]{.underline} nuclear-capable
ballistic [missiles can only be launched from
**sub**marine**s**]{.underline}.

Chevreuil believes that [any discussion in Paris]{.underline} --- [or
London]{.underline} --- [about the possibility]{.underline} of extending
its nuclear deterrent [will focus on preventing]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [from reacting by
withdrawing]{.underline} its forces from the continent. He believes he
will face the challenge of "appearing credible, both to his allies and
to Russia." A transfer of French nuclear weapons would also run into
legal obstacles: Paris would have to withdraw from the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, and in some countries, such as Lithuania,
constitutional reform would be necessary to host them.

#### It's impossible\-\--German speculation does not reflect [operational]{.underline} nor [political reality]{.underline}.

Atlantic Treaty Organization, "German Musings About a European Nuclear
Deterrent," National Institute for Public Policy, 01-03-2024,

"Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a
fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully." Samuel Johnson's
well-known observation may be over two centuries old, yet it sums up
nicely the current mood in parts of the European, notably German,
strategic community. Faced with an aggressive Russia to its East and
with a United States possibly heading toward a second Trump presidency,
[some Europeans fear]{.underline} for the worst: [the]{.underline} old
[continent deprived of the US]{.underline} "nuclear
[umbrella]{.underline}," left defenceless against Russian nuclear
blackmail. Hence, they try to concentrate their minds on what they
believe is the only way out of this dilemma: an independent European
nuclear deterrent.

In an interview with the German weekly Die Zeit in December 2023, former
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer argued in favour of European
nuclear deterrent.\[1\] This came as a surprise, since it was Fischer
who, upon coming into office in 1998, had started a (short-lived)
campaign for a NATO "no-first-use policy," and who, in 2020, had signed
a letter asking NATO's non-nuclear allies to join the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\[2\] A few days before Fischer's
about-face on nuclear deterrence, Herfried Münkler, a retired politics
professor and well-known author, imagined "a suitcase with a red button"
that would rotate among the major EU countries.\[3\]

The most elaborate case for a European nuclear deterrent appeared in the
conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, a paper that over
the past years had repeatedly published authors who would make the case
for a European or even a German nuclear arsenal. In an article entitled
"What will Europe do if Trump wins?," three of the paper's best-known
journalists painted a dire picture: the US would finally fold its
nuclear umbrella for Europe, leaving the continent with no alternative
but to build its own nuclear deterrent. However, while presenting their
case in detail, the [authors revealed]{.underline} their **[analytical
confusion]{.underline}**. For example, [they claimed]{.underline} that
[deterrence]{.underline} today [depends on the]{.underline} ability to
preemptively destroy an opponent's entire nuclear arsenal. They argued
that while the U.S. is capable of exercising such an option, the small
British and French arsenals are not. After inconclusive musings about
France's eventual willingness to spread its own nuclear umbrella across
Europe, the article concluded with a reference to the US-UK special
relationship, which could still ensure a certain US nuclear presence in
Europe.\[4\] One week later, the "Welt am Sonntag" published an article
that also predicted the imminent demise of the US "nuclear umbrella,"
and argued that, based on a core group of France, Germany and Poland,
Europe had to become a true defense union that would encompass the
nuclear domain.\[5\]

This is not the first time [German observers indulge in **speculation**
about alternative paths to nuclear protection]{.underline}. Ever since
the 2016 US election campaign, when candidate Trump made numerous
statements about the United States being taken advantage of by
free-riding allies, the German strategic community in particular has
been [worrying about the future of the transatlantic]{.underline}
security [relationship]{.underline}. In contrast to the earlier debate,
however, when a few German commentators called for German nuclear
weapons, the new debate appears to center around a European nuclear
option.\[6\] This European focus thus removes the highly controversial
scenario of an independent German bomb. It also makes more sense
politically, given that a truly integrated European Union (EU), akin to
the United States of America, would probably need to have a nuclear
deterrent of its own. Indeed, when ratifying West Germany's accession to
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1975, the German Government
stated its understanding that this Treaty would not preclude an eventual
nuclear deterrent in the framework of the EU.\[7\]

Yet [even]{.underline} this [moving away from a focus on
the]{.underline} "[German bomb]{.underline}" [towards a]{.underline}
more palatable [European nuclear arrangement does not change the fact
that this goal remains **unattainable** for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. The EU is suffering from economic woes, the rise of
populism, and from major disagreements ranging from immigration policy
to support for Ukraine. Hence, a European nuclear arsenal---the most
challenging of all projects the EU could ever undertake---is not in the
cards in the absence of some enormous shock to the system. Even the
genuine nervousness about a more erratic United States will not create
sufficient momentum to overcome the five formidable hurdles that such a
project would face.

Andrew **Higgins 25**, 3-7-2025, \"Alarmed by Trump, Poland Must Look at
Nuclear Options, Premier Says\", New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/europe/poland-nuclear-trump-tusk.html
// accessed 07-14-25 // AA

[Warning that a "profound change of American geopolitics"]{.underline}
had put Poland, as well as Ukraine, in an "objectively more difficult
situation," [Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland on Friday said his
country must drastically increase the size of its military and even
"reach for opportunities related to nuclear weapons."]{.underline} Mr.
Tusk, in a detailed speech on security to the Polish Parliament, did not
explicitly propose developing a nuclear arsenal, [but said that "it is
time for us to look boldly at our possibilities of having the most
modern weapons" and explore options for nuclear and "modern
unconventional weapons."]{.underline} He added that his government was
"talking seriously" with France, Europe's only nuclear power aside from
Britain and Russia, about the possibility of extending the French
nuclear umbrella to other European countries. In addition, he said,
[Poland needs to ensure that all adult men are "trained in the event of
war." His comments reflect the stark turnabout at the White House with
the return of President Trump, who has publicly denigrated the NATO
alliance, cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to defend much of Europe in
the event of a Russian attack and falsely shifted the blame for Russia's
invasion of Ukraine onto Kyiv. Mr. Trump's views were received with deep
alarm in Warsaw and other parts of Eastern Europe that have bitter
memories of being bullied and repeatedly occupied by Russia over
centuries.]{.underline} Poland is a signatory to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, which prohibits countries that were not among
five declared nuclear powers in 1970, when the treaty took effect, from
acquiring atomic weapons. But [Israel, India and Pakistan]{.underline},
which never signed onto the ban, and North Korea, [which withdrew from
the treaty, have all developed nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and there
has been sporadic discussion in Poland of trying to join the nuclear
club. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's former governing party,
said in 2022 that he would, "as a citizen," like to see Poland acquire
nuclear weapons but added: "As a responsible politician, I must assess
this idea as unrealistic." [Russian officials have suggested repeatedly
that they could use nuclear arms in the fight against
Ukraine,]{.underline} which is not a NATO member, particularly if the
West ramps up its military aid to Ukraine. But repeated escalations in
that aid so far have not prompted such a response. The French Institute
of International Relations warned in a report last year that "the war in
Ukraine has the potential to increase proliferation risks, as it signals
that nuclear powers can attack an adversary with conventional
capabilities while backing its actions with nuclear threats to deter
third-party intervention." ["The war also sends the message that nuclear
weapons are a necessary guarantor of national security," the report
said.]{.underline} When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, Ukraine
held on its territory the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal but
relinquished it in 1994, in return for a pledge from Russia, as well as
the United States and Britain, to respect Ukrainian borders and refrain
from the use or threat of military force. Many Ukrainians now regret
giving up this arsenal, as their government has appealed in vain for
NATO membership and direct involvement of Western forces in the war.
[Poland is the biggest military power among former members of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance that are now members of NATO.
But]{.underline} those nations have long looked to the United States,
with its nuclear arsenal and thousands of troops stationed in Poland and
elsewhere in Eastern Europe, as the guarantor of its security. [Poland
has a long tradition of nuclear expertise, dating to Marie
Sklodowska-Curie, the Polish-born French scientist who won Nobel Prizes
in physics and chemistry for her pioneering work in discovering
radioactivity --- a word she coined --- and radioactive elements in the
early 20th century. Stanislaw Ulam, a Polish mathematician and
physicist, played an important role in the Manhattan Project, the United
States' secret atomic bomb program during World War II, and in the
subsequent invention of the hydrogen bomb.]{.underline} Under Communism,
Poland trained a large group of nuclear engineers in preparation for a
nuclear power plant that it started building with Soviet assistance but
never finished. Poland last year approved plans for the construction of
its first atomic power station under a contract with America's
Westinghouse Electric. [Mr. Tusk dedicated most of his speech to the new
security situation created by Mr. Trump's abrupt upending of what had
been the pillars of American foreign policy since the end of World War
II.]{.underline} "We cannot deny these facts: Today, Poland's situation,
objectively, and Ukraine's situation, in particular, is more difficult
than it was a few months ago, and we must deal with this fact," he said.
"Washington's much more symmetrical attitude toward Moscow and Kyiv,
much more symmetrical than we had become accustomed to, is a little
different --- I am also putting it mildly --- from what we feel in
Poland or in Europe," he said.

Accessed 7.18.25\]

For a [case study of just how dangerously the second **Trump**
administration has **eroded** the **U.S. brand** overseas]{.underline},
[consider **Poland**]{.underline}, a [**steadfast** U.S. **ally** in
central Europe]{.underline} and one of the most reliably pro-American
countries on earth. Pew's June 2025 [Global Attitudes survey recorded a
**forty-point collapse** in Poles' confidence in President
**Trump**]{.underline} to do the right thing regarding world affairs
compared with the ratings former President Joe Biden enjoyed among Poles
just a year earlier---one of the sharpest drops anywhere in the
24-nation Pew study.

A lack of confidence in an individual U.S. president, of course, does
not necessarily mean that people in a particular country have lost faith
in the United States more broadly. But here too, the Pew research
suggests a troubling trend, [finding that **55% of people in Poland**
currently have a positive view of the United States, down from **77% a
year ago**]{.underline}. That 22-percentage point drop was the third
largest recorded, behind only Mexico (32 percentage points) and Sweden
(28 percentage points), and larger than the drop in Canada (20
percentage points).

How did this happen so quickly in a country in which the United States
has long benefitted from a deep reservoir of goodwill? And what does it
mean for a bilateral relationship that Trump himself once described as
central to the transatlantic relationship?

Given that Poland is a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its battle
against Russian aggression---and has historically been a victim of
Russian aggression itself---t[he **perception** that **Trump**,
especially early in his second term, was taking **Moscow's side** in the
war has contributed to the **erosion** of America's image in
**Poland**]{.underline}. The Pew study found that only 28% of Poles have
confidence in Trump when it comes to resolving the Ukraine, below the
median figure of 33% among all countries that were part of the study. A
range of other Trump administration policies have also tended to
alienate Europeans more broadly, from tariff threats to attacks on
international institutions.

But this is only part of the explanation. Poland, like the United
States, is deeply polarized. [And Trump is as polarizing a leader in
**Poland** as he is it **home**]{.underline}. Polish supporters of the
populist political right tend to favor Trump because they see him and
the MAGA movement as sympathetic to their concerns on social issues such
as abortion and transgender rights, while centrist and left-leaning
Poles disproportionately dislike the American president. In other words,
as one academic told me during my recent visit to Poland[, Poles have
increasingly projected their **own political divisions** onto their
evaluation of **U.S. administrations**]{.underline}.

Moreover, not all Poles disagree with Trump's move toward a negotiated
settlement to the Ukraine war. Like elsewhere, war fatigue has set in.
Poles are also increasingly weary of hosting the largest Ukrainian
refugee population in Europe. Like Trump, some see Ukraine and its
president Volodomyr Zelenskyy, as insufficiently grateful for the
Western support he has received. Right-wing politicians in Poland have
seized on such sentiments.

But there is another factor that has infuriated Poles across the
political spectrum, and that [is U.S. **public diplomacy** messaging in
the country]{.underline}. Since March, the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw has
blanketed Facebook and Instagram with Polish graphics warning that
"overstaying your U.S. visa could lead to a permanent ban." Another
oft-repeated State Department posting threatened (also in Polish): "if
you're considering illegal migration, don't even think about it." More
recent messaging, also directed at Poles, says that all visa applicants
must set their social media profiles to public.

A cursory survey of reactions to these postings reveals unequivocal and
consistent fury among Poles. "Why would we come to the United States to
study, if we are being treated like this by a close friend," is a
frequent refrain, as is "why would I want to travel to the United
States?" [Many note that they are unfollowing anything to do with the
**U.S. government**]{.underline}. On Instagram in particular, many of
these followers are young Poles. What was once a badge of
honor---[showing off a **U.S. university** or acceptance in a
U.S.-sponsored exchange program on social media---has become a
**reputational liability**]{.underline}.

civilian nuclear sector, such as Japan or South Korea, [Poland would
also have difficulty **enriching enough** fuel to **weapons-grade
purity** on its own]{.underline}.

It would also struggle to replicate Israel's feat of starting a nuclear
weapons programme **[under the radar]{.underline}**, not least because
[the **I**nternational **A**tomic **E**nergy **A**gency closely monitors
reactors for signs that radioactive materials might be **illicitly
removed**]{.underline}.

Hoffmann said: "[It would be **very difficult** for
Poland]{.underline}."

#### It's a [pipedream]{.underline}.

Polish Prime Minister Donald [Tusk delivered a momentous
speech]{.underline} last Friday before the Sejm, the lower house of
Parliament. Slated to cover national security, the remarks quickly
turned to a topic previously taboo: "We are talking seriously with the
French about the idea of a nuclear umbrella," Tusk [said]{.underline}.
"It is time to look more boldly at the most modern battlefield
technologies. [Conventional means are no longer enough]{.underline}. We
must reach for the most modern solutions, including those related to
nuclear weapons."

The words of the Prime Minister mark a historic change for the country.
Because finally, critical issues -- from the point of view of national
security -- are being discussed seriously, openly and in the right
place. Still, the basic problem remains unchanged: Poland will not have
its own nuclear arsenal, but will be dependent on allies.

But is that enough?

Nuclear sharing and NATO

[Building a nuclear weapon]{.underline} of our own [would require access
to fissile materials and the appropriate technology. It would require
**huge amounts of money, scientific support and enough
specialists**]{.underline} who would have to be **[educated in
Poland]{.underline}**. Ultimately, [it would]{.underline} also [require
violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which could result in
**international sanctions**]{.underline}.

**[At the end of the day, a Polish atomic bomb is a pipe
dream]{.underline}**.

For years, the [Americans have been reluctant to include Poland
in]{.underline} the "[Nuclear Sharing]{.underline}" program, which
includes Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey. The
Americans store their charges in these countries, and their use is only
possible with the consent of the United States.

[Considering]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's]{.underline} policy
of [reluctance towards NATO, the chances of Poland joining the Nuclear
Sharing program are]{.underline} now **[slim]{.underline}**.

#### They [can't]{.underline}.

These are large and expensive industrial enterprises. When the Danish
physicist Niels Bohr received a briefing on the U.S. Manhattan Project,
he turned to fellow physicist Edward Teller and said: "[You see, I told
you it couldn't be done without turning the **whole** **country** into a
factory]{.underline}. You have done just that." Maybe Bohr was thinking
of a Denmark-sized factory-country, but still.

In October 2022, [Poland announced that it had selected Westinghouse to
build three civilian nuclear power reactors for about \$**20 billion
each**]{.underline}. Construction is expected to start in 2026 and will
take about seven years. These reactors will make plutonium, but they
will be under international safeguards, and [their design makes it much
**more difficult** to use the **plutonium** in a
**weapon**]{.underline}. (The same goes for Poland's MARIA research
reactor.)

Still, the timeline gives some idea of how long it would take Poland to
build the facilities necessary. [Poland would also have to think about
how to **deliver** such a **weapon**]{.underline}, which means making
decisions about missiles or fighter aircraft. [Nuclear weapons programs
are measured in **years**]{.underline}, [sometimes
**decades**]{.underline}, [with expenses running in the many **tens of
billions** of **dollars**]{.underline}.

The need to build expensive industrial projects that take a long time
is, in large part, [why many leaders have found **talk** easier than
**action** when it comes to the bomb]{.underline}. As my colleague at
the Middlebury Institute, Philipp Bleek, has argued, many
countries---including U.S. allies---have explored a nuclear weapons
option in one fashion or another. Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Egypt, (West) Germany, Indonesia, Iraq, Italy, Japan, Libya, Norway,
Romania, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, and Taiwan have all at
least considered the possibility of a nuclear-armed future.

Very few countries that have explored have followed through, and
currently, only nine countries have gone all the way and acquired them.
Iran is somewhere in between, although that story is not yet over.
Tehran would make 10.

[That's because producing nuclear material is
**expensive**]{.underline}, **[difficult]{.underline}**, [and takes a
**long time**]{.underline}. Obviously, Poland could go faster with help.
But historically, long timelines have afforded the United States both
leverage over [potential proliferators]{.underline}, who also [needed
help to get their **program going**]{.underline}, and time to make them
a better offer---or at least an offer that they can't refuse.

#### France and other European nations fill in for defense through treaties

NANCY, France, May 9 (Reuters) - [France and Poland signed a
treaty]{.underline} on Friday [to increase cooperation on defence,
nuclear energy and other measures]{.underline}, in [a sign of growing
alliances]{.underline} between European nations [amid concerns about
U.S. commitment to Europe\'s security.]{.underline} The [signing
came]{.underline} a day before Ukraine hosts leaders of the so-called
\"coalition of the willing\" - countries led by France and Britain that
want to step up support for Ukraine [in the face of a more sceptical
Trump administration.]{.underline} President Emmanuel [Macron, speaking
alongside]{.underline} Polish Prime Minister Donald [Tusk, said France
would participate in the Ukraine summit]{.underline} but declined to say
whether he would attend, saying he would travel to Ukraine when
necessary. [The treaty with Poland includes a mutual assistance
clause]{.underline}, deepening [a commitment between the two NATO member
states to support each other in case of an attack]{.underline}, and a
pledge to deepen military and technological links. \"[I am deeply
convinced that from today France and Poland]{.underline} in these
difficult times will be able to [count on each other]{.underline} in
every situation,\" Tusk said. Earlier, [Tusk said the pact would pave
the way for cooperation]{.underline} on a potential extension [of the
French nuclear umbrella to cover Poland]{.underline}. However, there was
no specific mention of access to France\'s nuclear deterrent in the
treaty itself. [Macron said in March he was open to extending French
nuclear capabilities to other European nations]{.underline}, [partly in
response to growing doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump\'s long-term
commitment to European security. The new pact does]{.underline},
however, [include provisions for deeper integration on nuclear
energy]{.underline}, with France eager to export its nuclear know-how
across Europe and beyond. [The treaty is testament to fast-growing
Poland\'s increasingly pivotal role on the European stage]{.underline},
thanks to its strategic position on the continent\'s eastern flank.
Poland spends 4.12% of its economic output on defence, the highest
percentage in the NATO alliance. [Tusk\'s centrist, pro-European
government is keen to diversify its security partnerships beyond
Washington.]{.underline} The treaty is the first that France has signed
with a central European country after a series of pacts with Italy,
Spain and Germany. It was signed in the eastern French city of Nancy,
where Poland\'s King Stanislaw Leszczynski lived in the late 18th
century, becoming Duke of Lorraine after losing the Polish throne.
