#### Outweighs human existence

Scale of industrial farming

Number of Animals

According to Our World in Data, [[**83 billion** land
animals]{.mark} and **[128 billion]{.mark}** farmed [fish]{.mark} were
[slaughtered]{.mark} globally [in]{.mark} 20[22]{.mark} [**for meat
alone**.]{.mark}]{.underline} While this [number has been
rising]{.underline}, I will assume for simplicity that it remains
constant for the rest of the century (on average). 

Converting to human-equivalents

[[R]{.mark}ethink [P]{.mark}riorities]{.underline}
(RP) [[estimates]{.mark} that all land [animals]{.mark} we farm [have a
**welfare range** bigger than **0.1,**]{.mark} and all fish higher than
**0.01**. Using these figures, we might **approximate each land animal
as 0.1** of a "**human-equivalent**" in terms of potential suffering,
and each fish as 0.01 of a human-equivalent.]{.underline} Multiplying:

[[83 billion]{.mark} land [animals]{.mark} × 0.1 =
**[8]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 **[[billion
human-equivalents]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[128 billion fish]{.mark} × 0.01 = **[1]{.mark}.28 [billion
human-equivalents]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Summing these gives \~**[9.5]{.mark}8 [billion]{.mark}**
[human-**equivalents in suffering per year as a lower bound**,]{.mark}
compared to RP\'s numbers.]{.underline} Note that this calculation
assumes that the "badness"/disutility of an animal dying is proportional
to its welfare range - a stance that RP doesn\'t explicitly endorse.
Here, I simply use the welfare range values as a rought proxy.

#### It outweighs nuclear war by 100x

Above, we looked at how many animals count morally the same as one
human. We saw that from a welfarist perspective, there are two
components to this:

Animals are worthy of moral consideration if they are conscious, so we
need to consider the chances that each animal is conscious.

Animals have different welfare ranges (i.e. capacity for wellbeing). We
looked into the [**most recent** and most **comprehensive research**
that's been done on this topic]{.underline} --- Rethink
Priorities' Moral Weight Project.

If we use the **[[mean moral weights]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
Moral Weights Project (that include both the welfare ranges and a
weighting for the probability that each animal is conscious), and we
[[multiply]{.mark} those weights [by]{.mark} the [number of
animals]{.mark}]{.underline} of each species studied, we find that [we
[kill]{.mark} the [moral equivalent of **160 billion humans** each
year]{.mark} through factory farming]{.underline}, from a welfarist
perspective.

There's huge uncertainty on this figure. Just looking at uncertainty in
the welfare ranges, this figure might vary from 60 million to around 800
billion (using the 5th and 95th percentile estimates respectively). And
that is before taking into account uncertainty that this is the right
way to approach the question.

Still, let's compare that to the immediate consequences of a nuclear
catastrophe (putting aside the long-run implications for now). A
[large-scale **[nuc]{.mark}lear [catastrophe]{.mark}** could
[kill]{.mark} up to around **8 billion**]{.underline} humans ([[the
entire]{.mark}]{.underline} world [[population]{.underline}]{.mark}),
[and [do so **once**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- **[[not every
year.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Moreover, the [[suffering]{.mark} [caused by the way we **treat
animals**]{.mark}]{.underline} seems plausibly [**even [worse]{.mark}**
[than]{.mark} the suffering a [nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark} would cause
its [survivors.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This [suggests the scale of factory farming is **larger**
than]{.underline} (or perhaps similar to) the scale of
[the immediate consequences of a **large nuclear war**]{.underline}.
Personally, I'd guess that, [morally speaking, [the scale of factory
farming]{.mark}]{.underline} over the course of a few decades is
something like [[**100 times larger** than]{.underline}]{.mark} the
scale of the immediate consequences of [[a large nuclear
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Hundreds of billions are killed per year

**Ritchie '24** \[Hannah; Ph.D. in GeoSciences @ the University of
Edinburgh, Deputy Editor and Science Outreach Lead; "How many animals
are factory-farmed?"
https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-are-factory-farmed\] sajad

[More than [**100 billion** animals]{.mark}]{.underline} are
[[killed]{.underline}]{.mark} for meat and other animal products [[every
year]{.underline}.^1^]{.mark} That's [hundreds of millions]{.underline}
of animals **[every day]{.underline}**.

This in itself [amounts to a [large amount of **animal
suffering**]{.mark}. But what also matters for animal suffering is [what
their **lives** are like]{.mark}]{.underline} up to the moment they are
slaughtered: did they live in discomfort and poor conditions, or did
they have a relatively pain-free life?

It's difficult to capture animal living conditions with a single metric,
but one indicator that is often used is whether animals were raised in
'factory farms'.

In this article, I first define factory farms and then ask how many
animals are raised in these conditions. I first focus on the United
States, where we can get fairly good estimates from national statistics.
Then, I look at some global estimates, which are much lower quality but
might give us a sense of magnitude for these numbers.

What are [factory farms]{.underline}?

There is no specific definition of a 'factory farm'.

In agricultural research, they are often known as
'[**[concentrated]{.mark}** animal [feeding
**operations**]{.mark}]{.underline} (CAFO)'.

The US Department for Agriculture has consistent criteria for CAFOs to
track and quantify these farms. An animal feeding operation (AFO) is an
operation where [[animals are]{.mark} kept and [raised in **confined
situations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The animals are confined for 45 days
or more in a 12-month period. In other words, they have no access to the
outdoors over this period.

A *concentrated* animal feeding operation then has to meet a threshold
for the *number* of animals confined in that space. This matters for
their living conditions and the density of animals.

It defines it as an intensive feeding operation where many animals are
confined for over 45 days a year. The USDA also has criteria based on
how wastewater from the farm is treated and handled.

The threshold for a 'large number' is based on the *type* of animal --
size matters. The number is much larger for chickens than it is for
cows.

For example, an operation home to between 300 and 999 cows is defined as
a 'medium-sized CAFO', but a medium-sized chicken farm needs to have
between 37,500 and 124,999 animals.

What's curious about these definitions is that there is no measurement
of the *size* of the operation that these animals are held in. That
obviously also matters for their well-being. It matters whether a barn
holding 500 cows is 500, 1000, or 2000 square meters.

This additional measure to calculate the density of animals seems
important to their level of discomfort in factory farms. Data on this
would be very valuable. However, it's unlikely that the variation in
density varies significantly amongst most large farms. While there may
be some farms that meet the criteria for CAFO but are large enough to
give animals lots of space, this number is likely to be small.

Most CAFOs --- or [factory farms]{.underline} --- will have [animals in
**cramped** and uncomfortable conditions]{.underline}, not only in terms
of the small space given to them but also their [**restrictions** from
outdoor conditions]{.underline} that allow them to perform natural
behaviors. [Smaller animals, such as chickens]{.underline}, also [tend
to be treated more poorly and **packed** more **tightly**]{.underline}
relative to their body size, in addition to fitting many animals on each
farm.

[Nearly **all livestock** animals in the US are
**factory-farmed**]{.underline}

There is, unfortunately, no regularly updated data source that tracks
farming conditions and the number of animals that are factory farmed.

However, the Sentience Institute has used publicly available data --- in
this case, published by the USDA Census of Agriculture (number of
animals per farm) and Environment Protection Agency (CAFO definitions)
--- to estimate the extent of factory farming in the US.

It makes its data and calculations transparent for others to see how
they arrive at these figures.

It estimates that [99% of livestock **in the US** were
factory-farmed]{.underline} in 2022.^2^ That was [just over **10
billion** animals. More than the global human population]{.underline}.

This share varied by the type of animal.

[All fish raised in fish farms]{.underline} were considered to be
factory-farmed. [More than 98% of hens and pigs]{.underline}. For
[chickens]{.underline} and turkeys, the share was [more than 99%.
Cows]{.underline} were a bit more likely to be raised outside in fields,
with greater space and freedom. Nonetheless, [75%]{.underline} were
still fed in concentrated feeding operations for at least 45 days a
year.

In the chart, I've shown the number of each animal raised on factory
farms.^3^

\[IMAGE OMITTED\]

What do **[global estimates]{.underline}** tell us?

Global figures are even harder to find.

The Sentience Institute has also tried to estimate these numbers based
on the best available data. But it warns that they come with significant
[uncertainty]{.underline}.^4^

With that warning, let's see what the figures suggest. We'll start with
land animals because the uncertainty for fish is highest.

It's estimated that [three-quarters]{.underline} -- 74% -- [of land
livestock are factory-farmed]{.underline}. That means that [at any
**given time**, around **23 billion** animals are on these
farms]{.underline}.

The total in any given year would be several times as many. For example,
we know that around 70 billion chickens are slaughtered each year. More
than [three-quarters of those **chickens** will be
factory-farmed]{.underline} (since chickens are most likely to be farmed
intensively). Let's say 90% are. That [comes to more than **60 billion**
per year alone]{.underline}, without considering any other animals.^5^

Assuming that most [**fishing farming** is done under factory farm
conditions, **111 billion** more animals are
factory-farmed]{.underline}. 111 billion is the central estimate from
the Sentience Institute; this has wide uncertainty, ranging from 39 to
216 billion. For context, that's about the same as the number of humans
that have ever lived (estimated to be 108 billion).

#### Extinction is [good]{.underline}\-\--it solves [future generations]{.underline} of [non-human]{.underline} suffering.

It also seems likely that [the **[Big Future]{.mark}** premise
[applies]{.mark}]{.underline} at least as well [[to
**animals**]{.underline}]{.mark} as it does to humans. At present there
are around 8 billion [[human]{.mark} being[s]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
planet, but we [[are **outnumbered**]{.mark} by]{.underline} other
sentient vertebrate [animals of whom there are]{.underline} at the very
least 10 trillion (10\^13) and perhaps more than [a
**quadrillion**]{.underline} (10\^15) (Tomasik, 2019). On conservative
estimates, then, animals outnumber human beings by between a thousand
and a hundred thousand to one, but the true population of [animals may
be **orders of magnitude** higher. [Bristlemouth fish **alone**]{.mark}
may [number in the quadrillions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, 2019). This means that most sentient
individuals are nonhuman animals. If we assume that animal and human
populations will remain at the same ratio in the long term, then [the
long-term [future has]{.mark} the potential to contain **far**
[more]{.mark} **animal [suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline} and wellbeing
[[than]{.mark} **human**]{.underline} suffering and
**[[wellbeing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If we are impartially concerned
with maximizing wellbeing and minimizing suffering, then we ought to be
very concerned about the long-term future of nonhuman animals on the
assumption that they will continue to constitute the vast majority of
welfare subjects. If Big Future inclines us to take longtermism for
humans seriously, then it should also incline us to take longtermism for
animals seriously.

It might be objected here that it is unlikely that animal populations
will remain at their current levels. Animal populations might decline
drastically and remain at low levels for the rest of our planet's period
of habitability. In fact, it seems that wild animal populations have
decreased dramatically in the past 50 years, as human development has
reduced the habitats for many species, and this process might continue
until relatively few wild animals remain. A 2020 report by the wwf
suggests that there has been a 68% decline in the average populations of
monitored vertebrate species since 1970. It must be borne in mind,
however, that this report is concerned specifically with biodiversity,
not with animal populations generally, and the findings of the report
are compatible with global animal populations staying the same or
increasing. For example, the report mentions invasive species as a major
cause of biodiversity loss (2020, 22, 54) but if invasive species are
replacing native ones this need not cause a net decrease in animal
populations. Similarly, reductions in the numbers of large animals can
be more than compensated for by increases in the numbers of small
animals. Other causes of biodiversity loss more clearly seem to indicate
general population declines, however. Future humans might also eliminate
domesticated animal populations, for example by switching from animal
agriculture to plant-based or synthetic alternatives. If this happens
then the Big Future premise is not true of animals, and so the
longtermist thesis does not apply to them.

In response, we cannot simply assume that animal numbers will drop
significantly and remain low indefinitely. This will depend in large
part on the values and actions of human beings over the coming
centuries, and these are yet to be determined. Even if one were somehow
certain that humanity will eventually drive all the other animals to
near extinction, in order to do so humanity itself must survive long
enough. Ord (2020) puts the risk of human extinction within the next
century at about 17%. Newberry (2021, 4) cites several experts on
existential risk who also put the risk at around 20% in the next 100
years. If one accepts that there is a significant risk of human
extinction in the next 100 years, then in order to maintain that there
is a high probability that humans will drive animal populations to near
extinction one would also have to believe that they will do so
relatively soon, and that animal populations will never rebound after
human extinction. Secondly, as we will see in Section 3, there are some
ways in which humanity could ensure a long future for animals even if
animals do eventually go extinct on Earth. Thirdly, if one believes that
animals generally live good lives, or that they could live good lives
with human assistance, then one ought to be concerned about animal
extinction too, as this might reduce total wellbeing in the long term.15

A more fundamental point is that longtermists generally think about the
size of the future in terms of expected population, rather than in terms
of the most likely outcome or the median across various possible
outcomes.16 In essence this means that they generate high and low
estimates for possible future populations then weigh them according to
their probabilities thereby establishing a figure for the expected
population. They find that, since human populations have the potential
to be truly vast, the resulting figure is also vast, even when they
account for the possibility of very low populations or total extinction.
As Greaves and MacAskill say:

Even a 50% credence that the number of future beings will be zero would
decrease the expected number by only a factor of two. In contrast, a
credence as small as 1% that the future will contain, for example, 1
trillion beings per century for 100 million years ... increases the
expected number by a factor of 100.

The same consideration applies to the animal population -- since it has
the potential to be very large, we would need to have an unreasonably
high degree of confidence that their population would decline to zero or
near-zero in order to endorse a low figure for their expected
population. But, if a high expected human population is sufficient to
ground longtermist concern for human beings, then a high expected
population of animals ought to be sufficient to ground longtermist
concern for them too.

There is one final consideration relevant to the application of the Big
Future premise to animals. Longtermists often bolster their case by
arguing that human beings might one day colonize other planets, or that
we might one day create human minds on computers, all of which would
multiply the possible future population enormously.17 If we consider
such huge expansions to the human population likely, but think it very
unlikely that future animal populations will be expanded in the same
way, then we might be justified in thinking that the vast majority of
future sentient beings will be humans (or digital human minds) and so it
is much more important to ensure that the long-term future goes well for
them than for animals.18 That is, though the absolute number of animals
in the future remains large, it would be dwarfed by the human
population, and thus rendered irrelevant to our longtermist
decision-making.

This is of course highly speculative. There is no reason in principle
however why these [[technologies]{.mark} could]{.underline} not [also
**[multiply]{.mark}** animal [populations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Tomasik
(2018) speculates about the possibility that [future [human]{.mark}
being[s might]{.mark}]{.underline} choose to [[create **digital
worlds**]{.mark} replete [with **sentient**]{.mark}]{.underline} digital
**[[animals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps [[in **natural**
settings]{.underline}]{.mark} similar to those on Earth [[in which
they]{.mark} might **[suffer]{.mark} greatly**]{.underline}. Future
humans might also choose to create digital minds in order to maximize
hedonic wellbeing, and since animal minds are so much simpler than human
minds they might do so by creating digital animal minds rather than
digital human minds. A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons,
while a mouse brain contains a mere 70 million. Assuming that the
difficulty of creating a digital mind increases proportionally with the
number of neurons required, then a utility-maximizing would-be digital
mind creator might be advised to create digital mice rather than digital
people. In Section 3 I will consider the possibility that humans might
one day spread wild and/or domesticated animals to other worlds. Here I
will only say that this possibility is not negligible, and in fact there
are some ways in which it is much easier to spread animal life than
human life, and so we cannot discount the possibility that animal
populations will also be multiplied across physical and digital space.
It is possible therefore that animal populations will be multiplied by
these technologies just as human populations might be. Even if we think
this unlikely, so long as we do not think it impossible, the huge
numbers involved serve to increase the expected future animal population
significantly.

Of course, it is extremely difficult to make accurate predictions about
far future population sizes for humans or animals. There are so many
known and unknown factors that could cause the population to increase
dramatically, fall to zero, or anything in between. This uncertainty may
count against the plausibility of longtermism generally but is not an
argument against including animals in the longtermist framework. To show
that Big Future is true of humans but not of animals it is not enough to
point to the uncertainty about future population sizes. Rather, it must
be shown that there is an asymmetry between humans and animals which
means that, while the future human population is large in expectation,
the expected future animal population is not. I have argued above that
there is no such asymmetry -- if we believe that the expected human
population is large, we should think the same about the expected animal
population. Furthermore, there are some factors which give us reason to
expect a large animal population rather than a large human one. For
example, humans are just one species among many. We are an exceptional
species, and it is likely that we have the means to survive threats to
our existence which other animals do not, and so perhaps we are less
likely to go extinct than other species. However, there are millions of
species on the planet. Though our likelihood of going extinct might be
lower than that of any other species, it is unlikely that our chances of
survival are greater than those of all other species on Earth combined.
It may be the case then that humans go extinct while other animals live
on indefinitely, thus ensuring Big Future for animals, but not for us.
If it is unwarranted to be confident about the size of the future human
population, it is doubly so to be confident that our population will
increase and the population of animals will shrink or vanish.

Finally, there are two considerations that indicate that [longtermism is
**particularly** important for animals]{.underline}. The first concerns
our current capacity to help wild animals, which is far more limited
than it is likely to be in the future if we act today to ensure that we
expand that capacity. It is presently possible to help wild animals in
limited ways by vaccinating them against some diseases, leaving out food
supplements in times of extreme scarcity, and rescuing and
rehabilitating them when they are affected by natural catastrophes. The
main [[causes of **w**]{.underline}]{.mark}ild
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nimal **[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**uffering,
however, [[are **systemic** features]{.mark} of the natural world,
primarily **reproductive** strategies, **endemic
scarcity**]{.underline}, and various forms of antagonism, including
[**predation**, which [we]{.mark}]{.underline} currently [[have
**little** ability to influence]{.mark}. In order [to]{.mark}
**seriously [improve]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[lives]{.mark} of wild
animals we need]{.underline} to develop our [[scientific
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} of the causes of suffering and wellbeing
in diverse species of wild animals, we need to understand how the
various components of the biosphere interact so that we can better
predict the results of our interventions, and we need to develop the
technology to intervene safely and effectively. [These developments [may
take]{.mark}]{.underline} decades or
**[[centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}** to come to fruition. Those who are
concerned with animal wellbeing might therefore think that it is
important to begin the research work that will allow us to significantly
help wild animals in the future.

The second consideration concerns the relative stakes for humans and
animals in the future. The bad futures for humans considered by
longtermists often involve premature extinction, or failure to reach
full technological maturity. Futures like these are only 'bad' compared
to the positive futures which we could have, but they are not
intrinsically bad. Of course, there are possible futures in which human
beings suffer significantly, for example if a sufficiently bad global
totalitarian regime took over, or if a super-intelligent ai came to
positively value human suffering, but these futures are relatively
unlikely. [The **most [likely]{.mark}** [futures]{.mark} open to
**animals**]{.underline} on the other hand [[are]{.mark} **intrinsically
[bad]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in the sense that [[they involve]{.mark}
**large** amounts of [suffering for **large** numbers]{.mark} of animals
[over]{.mark} **very [long]{.mark}** [periods]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Unlike humans, who have the intelligence and technological skill to
solve the problems facing them, [animals seem]{.underline} almost
[**helpless** against the **natural forces** that cause them to
suffer]{.underline}. We might say that [the **default state** of animals
is to **suffer**]{.underline}. Since the most probable long-term futures
are extremely bad for animals, we have additional reason to take
measures today to try to change our trajectory to avoid those futures.

3 Causal Efficacy

In this section I will argue that Causal Efficacy applies to animals. By
utilizing the longtermist concepts of persistent states and value
lock-in, it is possible to identify some actions that we can take today
that we can reasonably expect to make the long-term future go better or
worse for animals. First, I describe was as a negative-value persistent
state which, absent human intervention, we can expect to last for a very
long time. I also describe some ways in which human agency could
increase the scale and persistence of was. Second, I argue that [[there
is]{.mark} a **[danger]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[humanity]{.mark}
might **[lock in]{.mark}** values which]{.underline} will [make
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} long-term [[future]{.mark} **much worse** for
animals [by **spreading**]{.mark} and **perpetuating** animal
[exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}, and by making future people less
concerned about mitigating was. Furthermore, if it is the case that
[[humanity will]{.mark} **soon [expand]{.mark}** [into
**space**]{.mark}]{.underline}, then [this is a]{.underline} very
strategically [**important** time]{.underline} at which [to avoid
locking in bad values]{.underline}.

3.1 was as a Negative-Value Persistent State

On Earth [**trillions** of animals suffer and die painfully **each
year**]{.underline} as a result of purely natural processes, while [a
**much smaller** number]{.underline} seem to [live good
lives]{.underline}. It is likely that [[the]{.mark} **vast
[majority]{.mark}** [of lives]{.mark}]{.underline} lived by wild animals
[today [are **bad**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and plausible that
[[**aggregate** welfare]{.mark} across **all lives**]{.underline} on
Earth [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[negative]{.underline}]{.mark}**.19 Furthermore, [this does **not**
seem to be]{.underline} an **[accidental]{.underline}** feature of life
on our planet; rather [it is caused by [**structural**
features]{.mark}]{.underline} of evolution by natural selection,
[and]{.underline} so was [is [**likely** to
continue]{.mark}]{.underline} to dominate animal wellbeing [for as
**long** as **life on Earth**]{.underline} continues to be governed by
those processes. In fact, since these natural harms are the predictable
result of natural selection, it is reasonable to think that [similar
outcomes will obtain [on **any** planet]{.mark}]{.underline} on which
sentient life evolves.20 It is difficult to quantify just how bad was on
Earth is, but we can make some reasonable estimates. [**Extremely
[conservatively]{.mark}** we can say]{.underline} that [**[ten
trillion]{.mark}** animals [die each **year** after]{.mark} enduring
**only** [1 minute of]{.mark} net [suffering]{.mark}. This would amount
to]{.underline} approximately [**18.2 million** years of experienced
suffering **each year** across all animals on Earth]{.underline}. If
this does not sound that bad, remember that [the [degree of
suffering]{.mark}]{.underline} that we are talking about [[is
**high**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [for example, [being **eaten**]{.mark}
**alive** [or dying of **starvation**]{.mark}. [This]{.mark}
estimate]{.underline} is highly conservative in many ways. First, it
[[takes the **lowest** estimate of]{.mark} wild animal
[populations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, [it [**falsely**
assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the number of
[deaths]{.mark}]{.underline} per year [[is **equal** to]{.mark} the
number of [animals alive]{.mark}]{.underline} at any given time, [but
[since the]{.mark} **vast [majority]{.mark}** [of animals]{.mark} are
small **short-lived** ones who [breed **frequently**]{.mark} and [in
**vast** numbers]{.mark}]{.underline}, the number of
[[deaths]{.underline}]{.mark} per year [[must be]{.mark} **much
[higher]{.mark}**]{.underline} than this. Third, [[it assumes only **one
minute** of]{.mark} net [suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}. This may be
true of animals such as small fish who are quickly eaten by predators
immediately after hatching, but it must be remembered that many
[[animals]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**starve**, or die from
**disease**, and]{.underline} even [those who are killed by
**predators**]{.underline} must [sometimes [endure **more**]{.mark} than
a minute of suffering]{.underline} from being pursued and eaten more
slowly. A reasonable higher estimate would be that there are a
quadrillion deaths per year. If we assume again only one minute of net
suffering each, [[that comes to **1.82 billion** years of]{.mark}
experienced [suffering **per year**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**increased**]{.mark} **stocking [densities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
it would [[reduce]{.mark} the [price of meat]{.mark}, [making it harder
for alt]{.mark}ernative product[s]{.mark} [to
compete]{.mark}]{.underline}). But there could be positives too, such as
reducing rates of disease. Animal advocates might be able to use AI
systems to analyse CCTV footage from slaughterhouses to identify and
prosecute violations. (For more on how AI might affect animals in the
short term, see this article from Max Taylor, a researcher at Animal
Charity Evaluators.)

If we don't reverse course soon, [industrial [animal
**agriculture**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and the value system that [deems
it]{.underline} both [acceptable and [**necessary** to raise
**animals**]{.mark} under]{.underline} such [conditions]{.underline} and
eat their meat---could be [here to stay]{.underline}.

As it turns out, history tells us that it's much easier to influence
values when they are still new than later on, when things have settled.
As an example of this dynamic he calls "early plasticity, later
rigidity," MacAskill asks us to consider the U.S. Constitution. It was
written over 116 days, and amended eleven times in the first six years.
But in the last fifty years, it's only been amended once. I suspect that
[if we don't make headway in ending factory farming]{.underline} soon,
it'll be not unlike many of the constitutional laws we find
distasteful---seemingly [[**impossible** to
overturn]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And as environmentalist Bill McKibben tells MacAskill, the climate
movement knows this all too well: "Thirty years ago, there were
relatively small things we could have done that would have changed the
trajectory of this battle---a small price on carbon back then would have
yielded a different trajectory, would have put us in a different place.
We might not have solved climate change yet because it's a huge problem,
but we'd be on the way."

[Major [technological advances]{.mark}]{.underline}, too, play a role
in [[**locking in** values]{.underline}]{.mark}. Writing, for example,
invented around five thousand years ago, was crucial, MacAskill points
out, "enabling complex ideas to be transmitted many generations into the
future without inevitable distortion by the failures of human memory."
Indeed, moral worldviews like Christianity and Islam would not have
achieved widespread popularity without writing as a technology. And the
key technology of our generation isn't electric cars or TikTok, but
rather [[artificial intelligence]{.mark}; it could [**impact**
the]{.mark} future]{.underline}, and our [perception of the moral
acceptability and]{.underline} the sheer [[existence of **factory
farms**, for **millions** of years]{.mark} to come]{.underline}.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

To understand why, we first need to unpack exactly what artificial
intelligence (AI) means. Put simply, it's the science and engineering of
making intelligent machines. Your smartphone uses AI, as do your social
media and streaming services. And thanks to machine
learning---a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers
the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed---AI can solve
complex problems in a way that is similar to how humans do. Remember in
2011 when IBM Watson, the room-sized supercomputer, beat jeopardy
legends Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter? That was machine learning in
action, and it's gotten even more advanced since. Today, AI can
create award-winning images and art, drive and park your car, and even
be a Twitter troll. But the holy grail of artificial intelligence is
something called artificial general intelligence (AGI)---the ability of
an "ultra intelligent" agent to understand or learn any intellectual
task that a human being can. Think WALL-E and R2-D2, agents, or
collections of agents, capable of making their own plans and executing
them. We aren't there yet, but experts predict there's a non-negligible
chance we could be in the decades to come.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

And here's the crux: [If it arrives, it may [**lock-in** the
values]{.mark} that exist [at the **time**]{.mark}]{.underline},
including [[how we]{.underline}]{.mark} think about and [[**treat
animals** on factory farms]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is because an AGI
could be coded to reflect the preferences of the programmer---a
potentially powerful individual or institution, since it's [unlikely
this technology will emerge in a decentralized way]{.underline} given
the capital and technical expertise required to build it---for the
purpose of assisting them in achieving their and what they believe
should be society's goals, and one of those goals might be raising
animals for food. What's more, an [[AGI]{.underline}]{.mark} would be
able to [[figure out how to **farm animals** in]{.mark} even more
[efficient ways, decreasing]{.mark} the **[cost]{.mark}** of
meat]{.underline}---which most people would celebrate---and
[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[profit
**margins**]{.underline}]{.mark} of those who stand to benefit from this
technology. No human would be more powerful than an AGI, so whatever
force aims an [AGI would have more power than any force]{.underline}
that does not have that ability.

This value lock-in, combined with the fact that an AGI would not be hard
to replicate, makes it such that the [[values **encoded** into
the]{.mark} AGI could [exist for as long as the **universe** can
**support life**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As MacAskill writes, "There's
nothing different in principle between the software that encodes Pong
and the software that encodes an AGI. Since that software can be copied
with high fidelity, an [AGI can survive changes in the
hardware]{.underline} instantiating it. AGI agents are potentially
immortal."

And this matters a lot, not just because of factory farms on Earth, but
because of [[factory farms]{.mark} that could come to **[exist]{.mark}
elsewhere**]{.underline}. Humans may begin [populating **[other
planets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, perhaps starting with Mars (especially
if billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have their way). They may
attempt to make other planets more Earth-like in their conditions---a
process called "terraforming"---or even create structures in space where
there were no planets before, so that they can support human, animal,
and plant life. And [they may want to eat animals]{.underline}, just
like they do on Earth. (We are creatures of habit, after all.) Indeed,
scientists are already working on meeting this future demand as part of
numerous programs to [[deploy **everything**
from chicken to fish]{.mark} to insect [**farming** in
space]{.mark}]{.underline}. Undoubtedly, colonizing other
planets [**[multiplies]{.mark}** the [potential]{.mark} for **animal
[suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

ChatGPT's release in November 2022 made many people realise that [[deep
learning]{.underline}]{.mark} was a [[**sea change** in
AI]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since then, **[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**arge
**[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**anguage **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**odels,
image models, and other AI systems have [continued to [advance
**rapidly**]{.mark}]{.underline} and [drawn **[massive
investments]{.mark}.**]{.underline}16

Because the [models get better so **quickly,**]{.underline} it can be
[hard for the public to keep up]{.underline}. [You might have an
outdated view]{.underline} of just how much modern AI systems can do if
you haven't used the latest models to their full extent.17

But we shouldn't just think about what they can do now. We should think
about how they've improved so far and how they're [likely to **improve**
in the **future**]{.underline}.

For example, consider the rapid progress language models have made on
the GPQA benchmark, which asks challenging,
[[**PhD**-level]{.mark}]{.underline} questions about [[**chemistry**,
**physics**]{.mark}, and **[bio]{.mark}**logy]{.underline}:

They've also shown impressive improvement on tasks
like [[software]{.mark} engineering]{.underline} and [**expert-level**
math problems.]{.underline}

As of March 2025, other impressive achievements from AI systems include:

Using computers: [Anthropic and OpenAI]{.underline} have AI models that
can be directed to [[carry out **tasks
independently**]{.mark}]{.underline} on [your computer]{.underline}.
These capabilities are still rudimentary, but we expect them to improve
quickly.

[Competing in math contests]{.underline}: By combining the
models AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, Google [DeepMind]{.underline} was
able to use AI to achieve silver medal performance in the International
Mathematical Olympiad.

[[Combin]{.mark}ing [**multiple** human]{.mark}-like
**[abilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}[:]{.mark} Models are [increasingly
**multi-modal**]{.underline}, which means they combine the abilities to
[[write]{.mark} and [read]{.mark} text]{.underline}, comprehend and
[[create images]{.underline}]{.mark}, and understand and respond to
[spoken language]{.underline}.

[**Predict**ing complex biomolecular structures]{.underline} and
interactions: Google
[DeepMind]{.underline}'s Alpha**[[Fold]{.underline}]{.mark}** 3 --- a
successor to a [**Nobel Prize**-winning]{.underline} AI system --- can
[predict how [proteins]{.mark} interact with]{.underline}
[DNA]{.underline}, RNA, and other structures at the molecular level.

Improving robotics: Google DeepMind's Gemini Robotics model uses a
language model to **[[control robots]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which can
[respond to verbal directions]{.underline}, [demonstrate spatial
awareness]{.underline}, and perform a range of real-world tasks.

[**Self-driving** cars]{.underline}: Waymo reportedly conducts 150,000
rides per week in self-driving cars as of March 2025 in major U.S.
cities, an increase of 3x from just a few months before, with plans to
expand further.

[Creating **novel**]{.underline} videos and [images]{.underline}: Image
models are now capable of generating high-quality images from written
descriptions, and video models such as Sora and Veo can even produce
impressive short clips based on text prompts.

Enhancing the work of doctors, lawyers, and scientists: Researchers have
found evidence that AI systems can outperform doctors in diagnosing
patients, significantly improve the productivity of lawyers,
anticipate discoveries in neuroscience, and improve research in material
science.18

[[Help]{.mark}ing [with **AI research**]{.mark}]{.underline}: There's
also evidence that AI systems can [[**outperform humans**]{.mark} in AI
R&D \[Research and Development\]]{.underline} tasks, when limited to a
two-hour time window.19

If you're anything like us, you found the complexity and breadth of the
tasks these systems can carry out surprising.

And if the technology keeps advancing at this pace, it seems clear there
will be major effects on society. At the very least, automating tasks
makes carrying out those tasks cheaper. As a result, we may see rapid
increases in economic growth (perhaps even to the level we saw during
the Industrial Revolution).

If we're able to partially or fully automate scientific advancement we
may see more transformative changes to society and technology.20

That could be just the beginning. We may be able to get computers
to eventually automate anything humans can do. This seems like it has to
be possible --- at least in principle. This is because it seems that,
with enough power and complexity, a computer should be able to simulate
the human brain. This would itself be a way of automating anything
humans can do (if not the most efficient method of doing so).

And as we'll see in the next section, there are some indications that
extensive automation may well be possible through scaling up existing
techniques.

[Current [trends show **rapid progress**]{.mark} in the capabilities of
ML systems]{.underline}

There are three things that are crucial to building AI through machine
learning:

**[Good algorithms]{.underline}** (e.g. more efficient algorithms are
better)

[**Data** to train an algorithm]{.underline}

[Enough computational power]{.underline} (known
as **[compute]{.underline}**) to do this training

[Epoch]{.underline} is a [team of scientists investigating
trends]{.underline} in the development of advanced AI --- in particular,
how these three inputs are changing over time.

They found that the amount of [[compute used for
training]{.underline}]{.mark} the largest AI models has been [[rising
**exponentially**]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[**[doubl]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} on average [[every six
months]{.underline}]{.mark} since 2010.

That means the amount of computational power used to [train]{.underline}
our largest [m]{.underline}achine [l]{.underline}earning
[models]{.underline} has [[grown by]{.mark} over **[one billion
times]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Epoch also looked at how much compute has been needed to train a neural
network to have the same performance on ImageNet (a well-known test data
set for computer vision).

They found that the [amount of [**compute required** for]{.mark} the
same [performance]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [**[fall]{.mark}**ing
**[exponentially]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---[halving every 10
months.]{.underline}

So [[since]{.mark} 20[12]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[amount of compute
required for]{.mark} the [same level of performance]{.mark}]{.underline}
has [[fall]{.mark}en]{.underline} by over **[[10,000
times]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Combined with the increased
compute]{.underline} used for training, that's a lot of growth.

Finally, they found that the size of the [[data
sets]{.underline}]{.mark} used to train the largest language models has
been [**[doubl]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} roughly [once a
year]{.underline} since 2010. And Epoch has projected that it will be
[[feasible to scale]{.mark} the existing pace of AI training on the
frontier [through]{.mark} **20[30]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It's hard to be sure that the capability growth will continue, but the
trends speak to the incredible gains that are possible with machine
learning.

Indeed, it looks like [increasing]{.underline} the [size of
models]{.underline} (and the amount of compute used to train them)
[[introduces]{.mark} ever [more **sophisticated**
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is how systems like [GPT-4 [perform
tasks they weren't]{.mark}]{.underline} specifically [[trained
for]{.underline}.]{.mark}

These observations have led to the scaling hypothesis: that [we can
simply build bigger and bigger neural networks]{.underline}, and as a
result we will [end up with more and more **powerful**
a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence, and that this trend
of increasing capabilities may increase to human-level AI and beyond.

If this is true, we can attempt to predict how the capabilities of AI
technology will increase over time simply by looking at how quickly we
are increasing the amount of compute available to train models.

In late 2024, we also started to see a new frontier for scaling
in inference time compute. This is compute used when, for example, a
language model answers a question.

The leading companies have found that by giving an AI model more time to
"think" about its answers, to reason through different possibilities and
select among them, they can perform much better. With this innovation,
AI companies found a new way to make models even more powerful.

As we'll see in the next section, it's not just the scaling hypothesis
that suggests we could end up with extremely powerful AI relatively soon
--- other methods of predicting AI progress come to similar conclusions.

When can we expect transformative AI?

It's difficult to predict exactly when we will develop AI that we expect
to be hugely transformative for society (for better or for worse) ---
for example, by automating all human work or drastically changing the
structure of society.21

But [by early 2025]{.underline}, [leaders]{.underline} of some
[of]{.underline} the [frontier AI]{.underline} companies were clearly
stating that they were [[expect]{.mark}ing]{.underline} to get [very
powerful AI systems soon]{.underline}.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, and Google DeepMind
CEO Demis Hassabis all said that they expect to develop AI that can
fully replace at least some forms of human labour within just a few
years, or even less.

Sam Altman wrote in January 2025:

We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally
understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents
"join the workforce" and materially change the output of companies.

Demis Hassabis said in January 2025:

We've sort of had a consistent view about AGI being a system that's
capable of exhibiting all of the cognitive capabilities humans can. And
I think we're getting closer and closer, but I think we're still
probably a handful of years away.

Dario Amodei wrote in February 2025:

Time is short, and we must accelerate our actions to match accelerating
AI progress. [Possibly [by **2026**]{.mark}]{.underline} or 2027 (and
almost [certainly no later than 2030]{.underline}), the capabilities of
AI systems will be best thought of as akin to an entirely new state
populated by highly intelligent people appearing on the global stage ---
a "country of geniuses in a datacenter"--- with the profound economic,
societal, and security implications that would bring.

Why **[[AGI]{.underline}]{.mark}** could be [here by
**[2030]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[AI]{.underline} has [gone from **unable** to string
**sentences**]{.underline} together [to [linguistic **fluency** in five
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the models are no longer just chatbots:
by the end of 2024, [leading models [match]{.mark}ed human
[**experts**]{.mark} at]{.underline} real-world [coding,]{.underline} AI
research [engineering, and [**PhD**-level]{.mark} scientific
questions]{.underline}, as long as the task took under two hours.

Recent [progress]{.underline} has been [driven by
**[scaling]{.mark}**]{.underline} how much
[**[comput]{.mark}**ation]{.underline} is [used to train AI
models]{.underline} ([**[4x]{.mark}** per year]{.underline}), [**rapidly
increasing** [algorithmic **efficiency**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[**3x**
per year]{.underline}]{.mark}), [teaching these models to
**[reason]{.mark}** using **[reinforcement
learning]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [turning them into
agents]{.underline}. All these trends are set to continue for the next
four years.

No-one knows how large the resulting advances will be. But trend
extrapolation suggests that, [[by]{.mark}
20**[28]{.mark}**]{.underline}, there's a good chance [we'll have
[AI]{.mark} agents who [surpass humans]{.mark} at]{.underline} coding
and [reasoning]{.underline}, have [expert-level knowledge in every
domain]{.underline}, and can [autonomously complete multi-week
projects]{.underline}, and progress would continue from there.

These agents would satisfy many people's definition of AGI and could
likely do many remote work tasks. Most critically, [**even if** still
limited]{.underline} in many ways, they might be [able to [**accelerate
AI** research itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There may also be normative reasons to take more seriously the
possibility of factory farming in space. In Suffering-Focused Ethics,
Magnus Vinding argues that happiness and suffering are deeply
asymmetrical, rather than arbitrary ends of a well-being scale that can
be algebraically balanced or outweighed. This implies that [while we

### Factory Farm\-\--Framing\-\--Neg Util

#### NEGATIVITY EFFECT\-\--pain categorically outweighs pleasure\-\--academic consensus votes neg.

Delaware; University of Delaware, "Negative Utilitarianism,"

trigger warning\-\--mentions of sexual abuse

Before we can accurately critique positive utilitarianism, we must
clearly distinguish suffering from the conventional utilitarian
conceptions of pleasure and pain. Modern psychology recognizes that
[**[pain]{.mark}** plays a **greater role** than **pleasure**
in]{.underline} an individual's [well-being]{.underline}. An argument
termed "Bad is Stronger Than Good" states "[bad things]{.underline} will
[[produce larger]{.underline}]{.mark}, more consistent, [more
**multifaceted**]{.underline}, or more lasting [[effects]{.mark} than
good things]{.underline}" (Baumeister, Bratslavsky and Fickenauer)1 .
Negative states differ from positive in the following ways.

1.  "[[Bad]{.underline}]{.mark}" or negative [[events have a greater
    effect on]{.mark} an individual's [**psychology** than]{.mark}
    a]{.underline} "[[good]{.underline}]{.mark}" or positive [event and
    take longer]{.underline} for an individual [to **recover**
    from]{.underline}

2.  [When]{.underline} individuals are [[asked to]{.mark}]{.underline}
    subjectively [[judge]{.underline}]{.mark} their own
    **[[well-being]{.underline}]{.mark}**, research shows that
    [**[negative events]{.mark}** [have a]{.mark}]{.underline} much
    [**[greater role]{.mark}** in the]{.underline} final
    [determination]{.underline}

3.  Positive events and negative events are not a 1:1 ratio, instead
    [[positive events must be]{.underline}]{.mark} between 3:1 or
    [[**5:1** in comparison to negative]{.underline}]{.mark} in order
    [[to be considered **equitable**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Shriver)

\(1\) is based on the refutation of the so-called "hedonic treadmill,"
the theory that over time both negative and positive events will wear
off and an individual is likely to return to a consistent emotional
equilibrium (Diener, Lucas and Scollon, Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill:
Revisiting the Adaptation Theory of Well-Being). Research has shown this
theory to be false -- [negative events require a longer **recovery**
period]{.underline} whereas [adjustments to positive events
are]{.underline} relatively **[rapid]{.underline}** (Brickman, Coates
and Janoff-Bulman). For example, the positive state associated with a
salary increase may be relatively short lived, quickly becoming the new
norm for the individual, whereas a loss in income will have both
immediate as well as lingering effects that can last for months or even
longer. [[Negative events]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[suffer
from]{.mark} a]{.underline} "[[**snowballing** effect]{.mark} of
**consecutive** bad outcomes]{.underline}" a process that does not seem
to appear to occur with positive events (Baumeister, Bratslavsky and
Fickenauer). This lag in time for an individual to adjust to negative
events and this snowball effect both help us understand why negative
experiences play a greater role in an individual's well-being.

[Numerous studies **back up** the asymmetry]{.underline} between
positive and negative experiences and illustrate how much more influence
negative events have on the individual. Evidence shows that [[humans
have]{.mark} a [built-in **bias** regarding negatively perceived
outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[called the]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[negativity effect]{.underline}]{.mark}**" which "can be roughly
defined as a greater impact of evaluatively negative than of equally
intense positive stimuli" (Peeters and Czapinski). We could frame this
in relation to the old retail sales maxim that one bad experience by a
customer can take five, ten or even more subsequent good experiences
before the positive counterbalances the negative.

One example of this asymmetry between negative and positive events is
demonstrated by the work of Kahneman and Tversky. Their research
demonstrates the decreasing utility of positive outcomes but also that
losses are weighed more heavily than gains in financial circumstances.
For example, gaining \$100 is not the negative equivalent of losing
\$100. For a positive gain to outweigh or be equal with a negative loss
it is required to be greater, for the \$100 loss example, a gain of
\$200 might be necessary for an individual to consider himself in
balance (Kahneman and Amos, The Psychology of Preferences).

A host of studies, highlighted by Baumeister, et. al "suggest single bad
events are far stronger than even the strongest good ones" (Baumeister,
Bratslavsky and Fickenauer). Sexual or child abuse, even if limited to a
single or few instances, have long term consequences for the victim,
including but not limited to "depression, relationship problems,
revictimization, and sexual disfunction," and there appears to be no
level of positive events that makes up for this (ibid). Further,
negative sexual experiences, can impact an individual's life leaving the
individual to suffer from compromised sexual functioning or the lack of
ability to enjoy a healthy sexual experience though positive experiences
show no such similar long term effects (Rynd) (Laumann, Paik and Rosen).

prevalence of suffering in Nature," no. 22; pp. 181-195\] jchen

This idea was backed initially by using the r/K selection theory,
introduced and popularized by the biologists MacArthur and Wilson
(1967), and later applied to the field of evolution of life histories
by Pianka (1970). According to this theory, there are in nature two
types of reproductive strategies, [**r-selection** and
**K-selection**]{.underline}, which are followed, respectively, by those
who maximize either their offspring or the survival of their offspring,
and which are typically accompanied by other life history traits
concerning lifespan, age at reproduction, size of offspring and others.
Over the years, however, this theory has been replaced by new paradigms
in biodemography focused, for example, in the examination of different
trade-offs between life history traits by considering the life tables of
different organisms (Stearns, 1992; Reznick, et al., 2002).
Nevertheless, regardless of the theory used to examine this question,
the same conclusion applies; the [**[lives]{.mark}** of most animals
appear to [contain **more suffering** than]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**positive** wellbeing]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is especially so in
the case of invertebrates, as they typically have very short lives. In
the case of fruit flies, for instance, a research carried out with
approximately 1,200,000 flies showed that only half of them reached 20
days of life (Carey, 2001). In the same way, the life-span of monarch
butterflies is around 2-3 months during the summer reproductive period,
and around 6-10 months during the winter migration period (Carey, 2001).
Either way, if we consider life expectancy or life-span, and without
even taking into consideration early mortality rate, the temporal
parameter of life differs greatly between mammals (extending for years)
and most invertebrates (extending for days) (Horiuchi, 2003). This is
very worrying, provided that the vast majority of the animals on the
planet are invertebrates.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

2.2. The distribution of suffering across different ecosystems A last
interesting issue to be considered, even briefly, is how suffering is
distributed in different ecosystems. It cannot be invariably inferred
that the same amount of suffering is present everywhere. Now, given the
numerous difficulties this question raises, we can only make some
speculations based mainly on the amount of biomass per ecosystem. In the
case of marine ecosystems, for example, there exists a significant
difference between estuaries or coral reefs, on the one hand, which
together with rainforests are some of the ecosystems with the largest
amount of biomass at global level (Ricklefs & Miller, 2000), and open
ocean, whose biomass production is only over that of deserts (Ricklefs &
Miller, 2000). Although biomass includes the net weight of non-sentient
living beings, such as plants and bacteria, the existence of these is an
indicator of the number of sentient individuals that can be expected to
be found (Ellwood & Foster, 2004). That said, let us suppose that the
\"line of neutrality\" (Ng, 1995), where well-being and suffering equal
0, is found in an area where the number of both vertebrate and
invertebrate animals equals 0. If the arguments presented in Section 1
and in Subsection 2.1 are right, that is, if there exists a prevalence
of suffering over wellbeing in nature caused by the search of efficacy
in genetic transmission, then it can be maintained that that situation
with a welfare and suffering equal to 0 is made worse in the ecosystems
with lower biomass, i.e. deserts (Ricklefs & Miller, 2000). We can infer
from what has been said that there is a prevalence of suffering over
well-being in deserts. Likewise, we can assume that suffering is
increased, as in the previous case, in ecosystems with a slightly higher
amount of biomass, such as tundra. This rule can be applied successively
until we reach the level of extreme suffering that prevails in places
with a greater amount of invertebrate biomass, namely, estuaries and
tropical forests. In the absence of further analysis of the conditions
that lead to this disparity in invertebrate biomass, such as
temperature, the conclusion we can draw is that the higher the biomass,
the larger the amount of suffering and the proportion to which it
prevails over positive happiness.2 3. Ethical implications of the
prevalence of suffering in nature 3.1. The moral relevance of suffering
The two previous sections were limited to the defense of factual
conclusions. In these sections, it has been maintained that a large
proportion of invertebrates have the capacity to suffer, and that this
suffering prevails over welfare. In this section, we will discuss the
consequences that these conclusions have in axiological and normative
dimensions. Ethics is a discipline that revolves around the positive and
negative effects of the actions of individuals on one another.
Accordingly, only those individuals who fulfill the condition of being
capable of having positive and negative subjective experiences should be
considered morally. Pleasure and pain are the morally relevant
properties. According to Bernstein, 2002: A property P is a morally
relevant property if and only if insofar as an individual possesses P,
that individual warrants its welfare be given preferential consideration
(treatment) vis-à-vis an individual who lacks P or has it to a lesser
extent to degree (2002, p. 531).

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Insofar as they are morally relevant properties, we should promote
pleasure and reduce pain with our acts. However, the question arises
whether both pleasure and pain can be symmetrically considered
(see Tomasik, 2016b, 2015). If this were so, then we would have to admit
that the fact of increasing the quantity of pleasure in 6 points on a
scale out of 10 in someone has the same moral relevance as reducing
suffering also in 6 points. Nevertheless, it [does not seem
**intuitive** to believe that making]{.underline} [someone **happy** has
the same **moral weight** as not making them **unhappy**]{.underline}
(Griffin, 1979). Rather, it seems to be the case that the [prevention of
[suffering has]{.mark} **moral [priority]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} the
[increase of **wellbeing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as negative
consequentialism holds.

[[Even if we]{.underline}]{.mark} were to [[**defend** the
symmetry]{.mark} between pleasure and pain [we would find a huge
**prevalence**]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the last]{.mark}
one]{.underline}. There is such a [**predominance** of
suffering]{.underline} in the world that almost the [same
conclusions]{.underline} [would **follow**]{.underline} if we maintained
a consequential negative theory, especially bearing in mind that the
vast majority of sentient individuals in nature are invertebrate animals
which follow the r-selection. Therefore, the conclusion that can be
drawn here is that, [in order [to **prioritize**]{.mark} the
[maximization of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[happiness]{.underline}**]{.mark}, existing amount of [[suffering
should be **minimized**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**Pursuing human happiness is [futile]{.underline}.**

Negative Utilitarianism,"
http://socialproblemsarelikemaths.blogspot.com/2011/01/in-search-of-negative-utilitarianism.html\]

There is yet a third reason why proposition A might be rejected. If we
believe that [[happiness]{.mark} is **illusory or
[unattainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then [there is nothing to give
**moral weight** to]{.underline}. Proposition A is rendered meaningless
or redundant. The most famous proponent of such pessimism in Western
philosophy is Arthur Schopenhauer. To better understand the reasoning
behind the pessimistic denial of happiness, it is instructive to
investigate his treatment of the concept.

The first premise of Schopenhauer's philosophy is that [existence, for
all living creatures, entails **striving**]{.underline}. We are all
particular manifestations of the will to life, and as such, [[we are
all]{.mark} **perpetually [consumed]{.mark}** [by
**desires**]{.mark}]{.underline} of one sort or another, which tend
generally to our survival and reproduction as a species (Note the
striking parallels with evolutionary biology). For Schopenhauer,
[['happiness' consists in]{.mark} the **satisfaction** of the will, in
the **[fulfilment]{.mark}** of our desires]{.underline}.

Now it is unclear from Schopenhauer's philosophy how this specialised
use of the term 'happiness' relates to the more common meaning of
happiness as a positive feeling or disposition. On one reading,
Schopenhauer seems to deny that happiness in this second sense is ever
possible: Schopenhauer scholar Christopher Janaway calls this the
'negativity of satisfaction' thesis. Alternatively, Schopenhauer may
merely be saying that the [satisfaction of preferences produces positive
feelings only **rarely**]{.underline} and/or fleetingly.

With the 'negativity of satisfaction' thesis, Schopenhauer suggests that
[happiness is an **illusion**]{.underline}:

\"[**[All]{.mark} satisfaction**, or what is commonly called
[**happiness**, is]{.mark}]{.underline} really and essentially [**always
[negative]{.mark}** only, and **[never
positive]{.mark}**....satisfaction or gratification can [never]{.mark}
be [more than **deliverance**]{.mark} from a **pain**]{.underline}, from
a want....consequently, we are only in the same position as we were
before this pain or suffering appeared.\"

\"[We feel **pain**, but **not painlessness**]{.underline}; care, but
not freedom from care; fear, but not safety and security. [We feel this
desire as we feel **hunger and thirst**; but [as soon as]{.mark} it has
been [satisfied, it]{.mark}]{.underline} is like the mouthful of food
that has been taken, and which **[[ceases to
exist]{.underline}]{.mark}** for our feelings the moment it is
swallowed.\"

Schopenhauer's core assertion is that attaining [what we strive for
**never produces** any **[positive feeling]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
all that we experience [is [**absence** of]{.mark} the longing or
**[suffering]{.mark}** that we felt before]{.underline}. When we fall in
love, all we experience is the absence of loneliness. When we win a
game, all we feel is respite from the fear of losing. Life, for
Schopenhauer, is nothing but suffering after suffering, broken up by the
occasional period of numbness. The pursuit of happiness is a "hunt for
game that does not exist".

\<\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMMITTED\>\>\>

It is interesting to place this argument in the context of Bentham's
definition of pleasure: "I call pleasure every sensation that a man
would rather feel at that instance than feel none". But as we've seen,
Schopenhauer, according to the negativity of satisfaction thesis, would
insist that it is impossible to have a sensation that is better than
feeling none at all. The reason that we are inclined to seek 'pleasure'
is simply because the satisfaction of preferences allows us to feel
nothing at all. Thus on Schopenhauer's account, pleasure (which of
course utilitarians take to be equivalent to happiness) does not exist.
It appears as though finally we have a genuine form of negative
utilitarianism that denies proposition A, and grants no weight to
happiness. Anyone who accepts pessimism (negativity of satisfaction),
hedonism (pain is the sole metric of value in the universe) and
consequentialism (the rightness of action depends only on the extent to
which it maximises value) seems committed to negative utilitarianism. It
could still be objected, however, that the negativity of satisfaction is
just an empirical, rather than a logically necessary claim. It is
therefore contingent on certain facts about the world. We could imagine
another or future world in which happiness as a positive emotion is
possible. Would the pessimist negative utilitarians be willing to grant
happiness any moral weight in such a world? If the answer is yes, then
pessimistic negative utilitarianism, like lexically negative
utilitarianism, is only adopted on practical grounds. It may be objected
that Schopenhauer would not accept hedonism and consequentialism, the
central elements of utilitarianism, since his ethical theory is closer
to a form of virtue ethics. Even if this is the case, it does not
undermine my general argument. All I sought to show is negative
utilitarianism is conceivable. Since there have been people who have
accepted the precepts if utilitarianism and people who have accepted the
negativity of satisfaction thesis, there is no reason why a person could
not affirm both. Such a person, I contend, would be committed to
negative utilitarianism. However, it is interesting to note that in the
arguments discussed here, Schopenhauer comes incredibly close to
espousing negative utilitarianism. Janaway notes that "An undefended
assumption in his argument is a stark form of hedonism: something adds
positive value to life if and only if it involves a felt pleasure, while
something contributes negative value if and only if it involves a felt
pain". Indeed, Janaway explicitly portrays Schopenhauer as a negative
utilitarian, in all but name: "we see that Schopenhauer has done
something quite bizarre: he has used as the test of value a hedonic
calculus in which each felt pain accumulates points on the down side of
life, but where the total figure for satisfaction is permanently set at
zero". What is this 'bizarre hedonic calculus' but the negative
utilitarian's metric of value?! Of course, for Schopenhauer's view to
fully morph into negative utilitarianism, he would need to accept
consequentialism, which he does not, to my knowledge. Yet in showing
that Schopenhauer's philosophy is so concordant with hedonism, we have
brought the pessimist and the utilitarian one step closer to the
unification we seek.

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>\>

At some points, Schopenhauer even looks to be arguing for the lexical
priority of suffering over happiness, quoting Petrarch: "[A **[thousand
pleasures]{.mark}** do [not compensate]{.mark} for **[one
pain]{.mark}**]{.underline}". He continues,

"For that thousands had lived in happiness and joy would never do away
with the anguish and death-agony of one individual; and just as little
does my present well-being undo my previous sufferings. Therefore, were
the evil in the world even a hundred times less than it is, its mere
existence would still be sufficient to establish a truth that may be
expressed in various ways...namely that we have not to be pleased but
rather sorry about the existence of the world; that its non-existence
would be preferable to its existence; that it is something which at the
bottom ought not to be.\"

Schopenhauer accepts the essential proposition of lexical negative
utilitarianism: that no amount of happiness can make up for the mere
existence of unhappiness.

Fascinatingly, Schopenhauer appears to embrace the supposedly repugnant
conclusion R.N. Smart takes to undermine negative utilitarianism:

\"[[Suppose that a]{.mark} ruler controls a **[weapon]{.mark}** capable
of **instantly**]{.underline} and painlessly [**[destroying]{.mark}**
the **[human]{.mark} race**. Now it is empirically certain that there
would be some **suffering** before all those alive on any proposed
destruction day were to die in the natural course of events.
Consequently the [**use** of the weapon]{.mark} is bound to **[diminish
suffering]{.mark}**, and would be the ruler's **duty**]{.underline} on
NU grounds.\"

### Factory Farms\-\--AT: Future Gens

#### It's not a reason we [shouldn't]{.underline} do wipeout\-\--people that aren't alive don't have value. 

**Finneron-Burns '17** \[Elizabeth; 2017; Teaching Fellow in Political
Theory at the University of Warwick and an Affiliated Researcher in
Philosophy at the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm, DPhil in
Political Theory at Oxford; Canadian Journal of Philosophy, "What's
Wrong With Human Extinction?" vol. 47, no 2-3\]

[When we talk about future lives being 'prevented', [we]{.mark} are
[say]{.mark}ing that [a possible person]{.mark}]{.underline} or a set of
possible people who [could potentially have existed [will now
never]{.mark} actually come to [exist]{.mark}. To say]{.underline} that
[it is wrong to prevent people from existing could]{.underline} either
[mean]{.underline} that a possible person could reasonably reject a
principle that permitted us not to create them, or that [[the foregone
value]{.mark} of their lives [provides a reason for rejecting]{.mark}
any principle that permits [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. To make the
first claim we would have to argue that a possible person could
reasonably reject any principle that prevented their existence on the
grounds that it prevented them in particular from existing. However,
this is implausible for two reasons.

First, we can only wrong someone who did, does or will actually exist
because wronging involves failing to take a person's interests into
account. When considering the permissibility of a principle allowing us
not to create Person X, we cannot take X's interest in being created
into account because X will not exist if we follow the principle. By
considering the standpoint of a person in our deliberations we consider
the burdens they will have to bear as a result of the principle. In this
case, there is no one who will bear any burdens since if the principle
is followed (that is, if we do not create X), X will not exist to bear
any burdens. So, only people who do/will actually exist can bear the
brunt of a principle, and therefore occupy a standpoint that is owed
justification.

Second, existence is not an interest at all and a possible person is not
disadvantaged by not being caused to exist. Rather than being an
interest, it is a necessary requirement in order to have interests.
Rivka Weinberg describes it as 'neutral' because causing a person to
exist is to create a subject who can have interests; existence is not an
interest itself.3 In order to be disadvantaged, there must be some
detrimental effect on your interests. However, without existence, a
person does not have any interests so they cannot be disadvantaged by
being kept out of existence. But, as Weinberg points out, 'never having
interests itself could not be contrary to people's interests since
without interest bearers, there can be no 'they' for it to be bad for'
(Weinberg 2008, 13). So, a principle that results in some possible
people never becoming actual does not impose any costs on those 'people'
because nobody is disadvantaged by not coming into existence.4

It therefore seems that it cannot be wrong to fail to bring particular
people into existence. This would mean that no one acts wrongly when
they fail to create another person. Writ large, it would also not be
wrong if everybody decided to exercise their prerogative not to create
new people and potentially, by consequence, allow human extinction.

One might respond here by saying that although it may be permissible for
one person to fail to create a new person, it is not permissible if
everyone chooses to do so because [human lives have value and allowing
human extinction would be to forgo a huge amount of value in the
world]{.underline}. This takes us to the second way of understanding the
potential wrongness of preventing people from existing --- the foregone
value of a life provides a reason for rejecting any principle that
prevents it.

One possible reply to this claim turns on the fact that many
philosophers acknowledge that the only, or at least the best, way to
think about the value of (individual or groups of) possible people's
lives is in impersonal terms (Parfit 1984; Reiman 2007; McMahan 2009).
Jeff McMahan, for example, writes 'at the time of one's choice there is
no one who exists or will exist independently of that choice for whose
sake one could be acting in causing him or her to exist ... it seems
therefore that any reason to cause or not to cause an individual to
exist ... is best considered an impersonal rather than
individual-affecting reason' (McMahan 2009, 52).

Another reply along similar lines would be to appeal to the value that
is lost or at least foregone when we fail to bring into existence a next
(or several next) generations of people with worth-living lives. Since
ex hypothesi worth-living lives have positive value, it is better to
create more such lives and worse to create fewer. Human extinction by
definition is the creation of no future lives and would 'deprive'
billions of 'people' of the opportunity to live worth-living lives. This
might reduce the amount of value in the world at the time of the
extinction (by killing already existing people), but it would also
prevent a much vaster amount of value in the future (by failing to
create more people).

Both replies depend on the impersonal value of human life. However,
recall that in [contractualism [impersonal values are not]{.mark} on
their own [grounds for]{.mark} reasonably [rejecting
principles]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scanlon himself says that [although we
have a strong reason not to destroy existing human lives, this reason
'does not flow from the thought that it is a good thing for there to be
more human life rather than less']{.underline} (104). In contractualism,
[[something cannot be wrong unless there is an impact **on a
person**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, [neither the impersonal value of
creating a particular person nor the impersonal value of human life writ
large could on its own provide a reason for rejecting a principle
permitting human extinction]{.underline}.

It seems therefore [that the fact [that extinction would deprive future
people]{.mark} of the [opportunity]{.mark} to live worth-living
lives]{.underline} (either by failing to create either particular future
people or future people in general) [[cannot provide]{.mark} us with [a
reason to consider]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark} to be
[wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the lost value of these 'lives'
itself cannot be the reason explaining the wrongness of extinction, it
is possible the knowledge of this loss might create a personal reason
for some existing people. I will consider this possibility later on in
section (d). But first I move to the second reason human extinction
might be wrong per se.

Whenever the topic of progress is raised, proponents of neoliberalism
are often quick to credit their preferred economic policies. Despite
escaping strict definition, [neoliberalism, at its core, is understood
to promote progress through economic growth, the latter being enabled by
laissez-faire economics. I think it's undeniable that free trade,
deregulation and privatization have been instrumental in extending human
lifespans and lifting people out of poverty, but are these same policies
not also, in part, responsible for the increase in violence toward
animals? [Tech]{.mark}nological [developments enable]{.mark} mass
[slaughter; discoveries]{.mark} in nutrition [allow farmers to
deny]{.mark} their livestock [sunlight]{.mark} and keep them indoors;
[combine]{.mark} these [trends with]{.mark} the incentive of
[maximizing]{.mark} profit [margins and]{.mark} what [you get]{.mark} is
[the perfect storm of]{.mark} animal [misery]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Neoliberalism is very effective, but it's also amoral (not to be
confused with immoral). The amount of good it can do is ultimately down
to our values. You want meat? You got it! And lots of it! I'm not
calling for the abandonment of neoliberalism, but I am stressing the
importance of adjusting our values. Any criticism of other economic and
political systems' empirical failings ("Communism kills!") will ring
hollow if death and suffering continue to escalate in our own societies.
For neoliberalism to deliver true progress we need to expand our moral
circle. Maybe 2018 can be the year in which we do just that.

Advantages of digital minds

Even today [[we see machines replacing humans]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the field of space exploration. Robots are hard to build, but they can
go places like Mars where it would be more expensive and more risky to
send humans. Computers need power, but this is easier to generate in
electrical form than by creating a supply of human-digestible foods that
contain a variety of nutrients. Machines are easier to shield from
radiation, don't need exercise to prevent muscle atrophy, and can
generally be made more hardy than biological astronauts.

But in the long run, it won't be just in space where machines will have
the advantage. Biological neurons transmit signals at 1 to 120 meters
per second, whereas electronic signals travel at 300 million meters per
second (the speed of light). [[Neurons]{.mark} can [fire]{.mark} at most
[200 times per second, compared with]{.mark} about [2 billion]{.mark}
times per second [for]{.mark} modern
[microprocessors]{.mark}]{.underline}. While human brains currently have
more total processing power than even the fastest supercomputers,
[[machines]{.mark} are predicted to **[catch up]{.mark}** in processing
power [within a **few decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Digital agents can
also be copied quickly, without requiring long development times.
Memories and cognition modules can be more easily imported and
distributed. Software code is transparent and so is easier to modify.
These and other considerations are outlined by Kaj Sotala's "Advantages
of Artificial Intelligences, Uploads, and Digital Minds".

[Scenarios in which machines supplant biological life may sound
preposterous]{.underline}, perhaps because they are common tropes in
science fiction. [But from a]{.underline} more [distant perspective,
**[a transition]{.mark} of power toward machines [seems]{.mark} almost
[inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline} at some point unless technological
progress permanently stagnates, [[because]{.mark} the
**[history]{.mark}** of life on Earth [is]{.mark} a history [of one
species]{.mark} being [displaced by another]{.mark}. Evolved human
[brains are **far from optimal**]{.mark}**ly efficient**, [and]{.mark}
so seem [likely to be displaced]{.mark} unless special effort is taken
to prevent this]{.underline}. Even if biological humans remain, it's
plausible they would make heavy use of machine agents to spread to the
stars in ways that are dangerous or impossible for collections of cells
like us

Do digital minds matter ethically?

If, as seems plausible, [[most]{.mark} of the minds of the far future
[will be **digital**]{.mark} rather than biological]{.underline}, where
does this leave the cause of reducing animal suffering? Biological
animals may remain after the machine transition, or they may go extinct
as people and machines appropriate their habitats in order to create
more machines. But either way, they may eventually be vastly outnumbered
by digital intelligence, especially if machines colonize space in order
to acquire more computing substrate and energy.

A few philosophers maintain that artificial intelligence (AI) cannot be
conscious, so if we care only about conscious suffering, AIs would not
show up on our moral radar. But most philosophers and scientists agree
that AIs could in principle experience conscious emotions if they were
constructed in the right ways, and much of the debate concerns where the
boundary between unconscious and conscious machines lies.

I think it's pretty likely that most people would grant human rights to
very human-like AIs, such as perfect "uploads" of human brains --- if
only because people could see such AIs generate poignant reports about
the depths of their emotional lives. Many science-fiction movies have
already popularized the idea of caring about humanoid robots. Indeed,
people often express sympathy even for simple robots that have far less
intelligence than a fruit fly, perhaps because the robots look like
humans or pets. We might compare this trend to the way in which humans
care more about "cute" animals than ugly or disgusting animals of
comparable cognitive ability.

I think the more neglected moral issue with digital minds is whether
people will care about agents that don't appear human-like, don't have
robotic bodies, or can't communicate. [Most of the
artificial]{.underline}, harnessable [computation that happens on Earth
today takes the form of silent, invisible processes within personal
computers, cluster computers, and other digital devices. Operating
systems, monitoring routines, data processing, large-scale machine
learning, and network management are more representative of computation
today than a few embodied robots or virtual chatbots. The same may hold
in the future insofar as any advanced civilization will need large
amounts of infrastructural computation to manage its resources and
development]{.underline}.

[But would these "business-oriented" information-processing computations
have moral significance?]{.underline} Probably their micro-level
behavior and even collective dynamics would be different from that of
human brains. Some artificial algorithms, such as reinforcement
learning, do show surprising similarity with biological cognition, but
even in these domains, there are often artificial tweaks to the
algorithms that render them less reminiscent of their biological
inspirations. It's possible that even very sophisticated computational
systems of the future will show only modest resemblance to human-style
emotion.

At the same time, [one lesson that animal advocates have learned is that
minds can matter morally even if they're built differently from human
minds]{.underline}. For example, [birds lack the mammalian
neocortex]{.underline}, but they have a different structure to perform
comparable functions. [Insect brains look even less like]{.underline}
those of [mammals, but]{.underline} some scientists and animal advocates
feel that [even insect suffering should be averted]{.underline}. How far
away from human resemblance we want to extend moral consideration is a
deep and difficult question, but it's one that needs to be explored more
seriously, and animal advocates have an important place in this
discussion. For instance, it was only because I already cared about
animal welfare that I even considered the idea that powerless
subprocesses of a future intelligent civilization's computations might
have moral standing. The focus by animal activists on suffering by
voiceless creatures who are often hidden out of sight has relevance to
the case of digital sentience.

Some amount of instrumental computation will be necessary for any
intelligent civilization, for the same reason as many computers are
necessary for business, governance, and maintenance today. But even if
we can't prevent suffering computations from being run, we can apply the
same Three Rs as in the context of animal welfare:

Replace more suffering-like computations with less conscious or more
happiness-like computations.

Reduce the number of suffering-like computations run.

Refine suffering-like algorithms to be "more humane", even if doing so
sacrifices efficiency or performance.

Virtual animals

While it seems relatively clear that [any]{.underline} spacefaring
[[advanced civilization]{.underline}]{.mark} will need lots of
instrumental computational subprocesses, such a civilization
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[have a vast scope for]{.mark}
discretionary [computation]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a similar way as
consumers in wealthy countries have money to spend on luxuries, hobbies,
and entertainment. There are many possibilities for what these
discretionary computations might look like. For instance:

They could support a vast population of human-like digital minds in
advanced virtual societies.

Computational power might be parceled out to each person to use as s/he
pleases. Perhaps some people would create vast video-game worlds, others
would explore the depths of mathematics, and others would run lots of
copies of themselves.

Artificial mind architectures might replace human-like minds altogether
and create a vast, unified, galaxy-wide agent pursuing various goals.

An AI might spend all of its discretionary computation trying to solve a
mathematical problem or optimize the layout of the physical universe.

...and there are many other plausible outcomes.

At least [some]{.underline} of these [[scenarios entail **large
numbers** of]{.mark} **complex [digital agents]{.mark}** [in
**lifelike**]{.mark} **virtual [worlds]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Perhaps
some [environmentalists would build animal-rich virtual habits to a high
level of precision. [Biologists might]{.mark} develop artificial animals
and [simulate]{.mark} their [evolution, including]{.mark} the **pain [of
being eaten alive]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} **dying from
[parasitism]{.mark}**. Video [gamers]{.mark} might [create vast]{.mark}
arrays of sentient [creatures to be **mowed down**]{.mark} **with
machine guns**. The animals in these scenarios might or might not look
like the fauna we see on Earth, but [some]{.mark} of them might
[have]{.mark} **comparable [intelligence]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**emotional [depth]{.mark}** as chickens or cows]{.underline}.

**[[Human values may not control the future]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Nick Bostrom\'s \"The Future of Human Evolution\" describes a scenario
in which [human values of fun, leisure, and relationships may be
[replaced by hyper-optimized agents]{.mark} that can better compete in
the Darwinian race to control our future light cone. The only way we
could avert this competitive scenario, Bostrom suggests, would be via a
\"singleton,\" a unified agent or governing structure that could control
evolution. Of course, even a singleton may not carry on human values.
Many naive AI agents that humans might build may optimize an objective
function that humans find pointless. Or even if humans do maintain hands
on the steering wheel, it\'s far from guaranteed that we can preserve
our goals in a stable way across major self-modifications going forward.
Caspar Oesterheld has suggested that even if a singleton AI emerges on
Earth, it might still face the prospect of competition from
extraterrestrials, as a result of which, it might feel pressure to
quickly build more powerful successor agents for which it would not be
able to verify full goal alignment, thereby leading to goal
drift.]{.underline}

[These [factors suggest]{.mark} that even conditional on human
technological progress continuing, [the probability]{.mark} that [human
values are realized]{.mark} in the future [may not be]{.mark} very
[large]{.mark}. Carrying out human values seems to require a singleton
that\'s not a blind optimizer, that can stably preserve values, and that
is shaped by designers who care about human values rather than selfish
gain or something else. This is important to keep in mind when we
imagine what future humans might be able to bring about with their
technology.]{.underline}

[[Some]{.mark} people [believe]{.mark} that sufficiently advanced
[superintelligences will discover]{.mark} the [moral truth and]{.mark}
hence necessarily [do the right things]{.mark}. Thus, it\'s claimed, as
long as humanity survives and grows more intelligent, the right things
will eventually happen. [There are]{.mark} two [problems]{.mark} with
this view. [First, Occam\'s razor militates against]{.mark} the
existence of [a moral truth]{.mark} (whatever that\'s supposed to mean).
[Second, even if]{.mark} such moral truth existed, [why should]{.mark} a
[superintelligence care]{.mark} about it? There are [plenty of brilliant
people]{.mark} on Earth today who [eat meat. They know]{.mark} perfectly
well [the suffering]{.mark} that [it causes, but]{.mark} their
[motivational systems aren\'t]{.mark} sufficiently [engaged by]{.mark}
the [harm]{.mark} they\'re doing to farm animals. The same can be true
for superintelligences. Indeed, arbitrary [intelligences]{.mark} in
mind-space [needn\'t have]{.mark} even [the slightest]{.mark} inklings
of [empathy for]{.mark} the [suffering]{.mark} that sentients
experience]{.underline}.

Using welfare ranges

The [[most **recent** and]{.mark} most [**comprehensive** approach to
comparing animals]{.mark} to humans]{.underline} was pioneered by Jason
Schukraft and Bob Fischer, two philosophers working for [[Rethink
Priorities']{.underline}]{.mark} Moral Weight Project.

They try to [[assess]{.mark} animals' capacity for welfare]{.underline},
which they [split into two components:]{.underline}

Their [lifespan]{.underline} --- if animals live longer, they will
experience more

Their [[welfare range]{.underline}]{.mark} --- how much capacity they
have for welfare in each moment

To assess these welfare ranges, Rethink Priorities got together a team
of three [philosophers]{.underline}, two [[comparative
**psychologists**]{.underline}]{.mark}, two [fish welfare
researchers]{.underline}, two [entomologists]{.underline}, an [animal
[welfare scientist]{.mark}, and a veterinarian]{.underline}. They listed
82 different possible proxies for welfare ranges (things like animals'
response to painkillers, the mirror test, or finding depression-like
behaviour), and investigated them for a range of animals.

Next, they aggregated this information using 12 different assumptions,
for example:148

Going by neuron count alone

[Using multiple different **quantitative measures**]{.underline} (such
as [**[brain]{.mark} mass** [to body]{.mark} mass **ratio** and the
maximum number of [**nociceptor spikes** per
second]{.mark}]{.underline}), and then [taking a **[weighted
average]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the ratio between these values and the
values in humans

Looking at the proportion of the qualitative proxies each animal has
compared to humans (humans have all the proxies)

Looking at just certain subsets of the proxies or using quantitative
adjustments that exaggerate the differences between species

Using nine of these assumptions (mainly qualitative assumptions as well
as neuron counts), the researchers used a
**[[simulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[determine welfare
scores]{.mark}, and [quantifi]{.mark}ed their
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}.149

They then made two adjustments to the models:

The researchers assumed there is a 28% chance that an animal's
subjective experience of time varies by species. That is, perhaps there
are more "experienced moments" per second for some species than others,
that should increase the welfare range. They tried to estimate this
effect.150

The researchers made some guesses about the probability each animal was
conscious.

Finally, they combined the results from these nine assumptions.151 Here
are their results:152

The means and medians are surprisingly high --- [based on]{.underline}
the **[[mean values]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [chickens have a [welfare
**range only**]{.mark} **[three times smaller]{.mark}** than
humans]{.underline}, compared to 1,000 times smaller when using the
neuron count method. Even insects, like black soldier flies, have only
approximately 100 times smaller ranges than humans. (Rethink Priorities
have argued that this result shouldn't be surprising.)

That said, the main thing to take away from this graph is the [high
uncertainty]{.underline}: the error bars (representing a 90% confidence
interval) are huge.153 There's also a lot that's subjective here. For
example, the researchers estimated an approximately 40% chance that
salmon are conscious. If you adjusted this to the 5% lower bound on
consciousness for adult farmed animals we suggested above, you'd get an
almost 10 times lower estimate (note silkworms are juveniles).

There are also some ways in which these [could be **underestimates** of
welfare ranges]{.underline}. In particular, the researchers assumed that
if they couldn't find any studies on a particular proxy, the species
did not have that trait, effectively penalising less-studied animals.

#### Prioritize [species-neutral]{.underline} approaches to [ethics]{.underline}\-\--anything else is a [slippery slope]{.underline} to [genocide]{.underline}.

Human-Directed Prejudice and the Devaluation of Non-Human Animals," pp.
3-10\] kento, SDO = Social Dominance Orientation

Philosophers and [**scientists** have noted]{.underline} the many
[**similarities** between the systemic **exploitation** of **animals**
and]{.underline} (past and ongoing) systemic [discrimination against
certain **human** groups]{.underline}, [such as **racism** and
**sexism**]{.underline} (Dhont et al., 2020; Horta, 2010; Singer, 1975).
Building on these observations, an emerging field of [study]{.underline}
is [exploring the **psychology** underlying the **differential**
treatment of beings based on their **species**]{.underline} membership
(Caviola et al., 2019; Dhont et al., 2020). These attitudes and
behaviors are often subsumed under the label of
"**[[speciesism]{.underline}]{.mark}**", a term that is meant to
[[highlight **parallels** with **racism**]{.mark} and
**sexism**]{.underline} (Horta, 2010; Singer, 1975). But [parallels may
not only **exist** at the **surface**]{.underline}. Some have proposed
that both prejudice against humans and prejudice against animals are the
product of the same underlying psychology (Dhont et al., 2016; Dhont &
Hodson, 2014). Thus, [**generalized** prejudice]{.underline}--- the
observation that people who are prejudiced against one social group also
tend to be prejudiced against other social groups---[may]{.underline}
not only [generalize]{.underline} across different social groups (Akrami
et al., 2011; Bergh & Brandt, 2023), but also [across **species**
lines]{.underline}.

The present [**studies** test this **hypothesis**]{.underline},
examining whether people who show prejudice against different social
groups also show prejudice against animals. The [[studies]{.mark} are
[**based** on large]{.mark}, **demographically** diverse
[samples]{.mark} of **participants**]{.underline} (Study 1: 56,759
[participants from **46 countries**]{.underline}, Study 2: 1,566
participants from the Netherlands) [and [examine]{.mark} a **host** of
[attitudes]{.mark}, **beliefs**]{.underline}, emotional responses, [and
behaviors [related to]{.mark} the **devaluation** of
**[animals]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Prejudice against humans and animals

Decades of research have shown that people who derogate and devalue some
groups also tend to devalue and derogate others, an individual
difference that is referred to as generalized prejudice (Akrami et al.,
2011; Allport, 1954; Dhont et al., 2016). One [**explanation** for
why]{.underline} different forms of **[prejudice]{.underline}** often
[come as a **package** deal is that they are **underpinned** by the
**same beliefs**]{.underline} and ideologies. Two traits in particular
are often invoked to explain the causes of generalized prejudice:
right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), a preference for conformity,
traditional values, and deference to authority (Altemeyer, 1981), and
social dominance orientation (SDO), a preference for group-based
dominance hierarchies and social inequalities (Ho et al., 2015).

Building on this work, [recent **theoretical** models propose that
**generalized** [prejudice and]{.mark} the
**[devaluation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and derogation [[of
**animals**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[manifested]{.underline}, for
example, [in]{.underline} the common practices of [meat
**consumption**]{.underline}, [animal **experimentation**]{.underline},
[and recreational **hunting**]{.underline}---[[share the same]{.mark}
underlying [**psychological** mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline} (Costello
& Hodson, 2010, 2014; Dhont et al., 2016). SDO in particular has been
highlighted as a proximate cause of prejudice against humans and animals
alike (Dhont & Hodson, 2014; Sibley & Duckitt, 2008). According to the
[social **dominance** human-animal **relations** model]{.underline}
(SD-HARM), [preferences for **group-based** hierarchy]{.underline} and
inequality, as captured by measures of SDO, [motivated **prejudice**
towards]{.underline} both [humans and **non-human** animals]{.underline}
(Dhont et al., 2016). Moreover, the interspecies model of prejudice
posits that beliefs about the fundamental divide between humans and
animals, and human superiority in particular, [facilitate the
**derogation** of human outgroups by **likening** them to lower-status
**animals**]{.underline} (Costello & Hodson, 2010, 2014).

[There is considerable [**empirical** support for
the]{.mark}]{.underline} proposed [**[links]{.mark}** between
**prejudice** against humans and **animals**]{.underline}. Individual
[differences in **[speciesism]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., attributions
of lower moral worth to animals) [are **positively** [related to]{.mark}
measures of **[racism]{.mark}** and sexism]{.underline} (Caviola et al.,
2019; Dhont et al., 2016), and broader antisocial personality traits
such as low empathy, entitlement, and callousness (Hopwood & Bleidorn,
2020). For example, a study by Jackson (2019) showed that participants
who scored higher on speciesism also indicated more negative attitudes
towards a host of social groups (measured with feeling thermometers),
and this association was particularly strong for groups that are
typically marginalized (e.g., homosexuals, Muslims, and disabled
people). The killing and consumption of animals is perhaps the most
typical symptom of the devaluation of animal lives. Evidence suggests
that meat eaters are also more likely to be prejudiced against human
groups (Veser et al., 2015). Lay people may even be aware that
generalized prejudice extends to non-human groups: Participants expected
that a [[person with **speciesist** attitudes would be less supportive
of **gay**]{.underline}, **[Black]{.underline}**, [and **women**'s
rights]{.underline}]{.mark} (Everett et al., 2019). Finally, [there is
**evidence** showing that **interventions** that tend to reduce
**prejudice** towards **humans**]{.underline} groups, imagined contact
with a member of the group, may also [**succeed** in reducing prejudice
towards **animals**]{.underline} (Auger & Amiot, 2019).

There is also evidence suggesting that social dominance orientation can
explain prejudice against both humans and animals. Decades of research
have shown that SDO predicts prejudice against various social groups
(Bergh & Brandt, 2023; Ho et al., 2015; Sibley & Duckitt, 2008).

Recent work has found similar associations between SDO and prejudice
against animals. [People who score [**higher** on **SDO** also]{.mark}
score [higher on **speciesist**]{.mark} attitudes]{.underline} (Caviola
et al., 2019; Dhont et al., 2016; Dhont & Hodson, 2014; Graça et al.,
2018; Hopwood & Bleidorn, 2020). They are more likely to think that
hunting and fishing are justified (Hopwood & Bleidorn, 2020), [more
strongly **endorse** the **use** of animals by **humans**]{.underline}
(Hyers, 2006), [and are [**less** likely to
**condemn**]{.mark}]{.underline} acts of **[[animal
cruelty]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Jarmakowski-Kostrzanowski & Radkiewicz,
2021). Several studies have shown that meat eaters score higher on SDO
than vegetarians or vegans (Dhont & Hodson, 2014; Krings et al., 2021;
Veser et al., 2015) and high-SDO individuals are less motivated to
reduce their meat consumption because of animal welfare concerns
(Hopwood & Bleidorn, 2020).

Research by Dhont and colleagues (2014, 2016) directly tested whether
SDO can account for the links between prejudice towards humans and
animals. [Across **multiple** studies]{.underline}, they found that
[[**speciesist** attitudes were **positively** correlated with **ethnic
prejudice**]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e., more negative attitudes towards
immigrants and various ethnic minorities). [**SDO** was positively
**related** to both]{.underline} and, crucially, the positive
association between speciesism and ethnic prejudice was nonsignificant
when controlling for SDO. These findings were replicated by Jackson
(2019), who found positive associations between SDO, speciesism, and
prejudice towards marginalized social groups (although there was still a
significant link between speciesism and prejudice towards humans when
controlling for SDO). Thus, [accumulating **evidence** supports the
notion that **generalized** prejudice also **extends** to
**animals**]{.underline} and that individual differences in SDO can
explain this link.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The Present Studies Prior work mostly supported the notion that human-
and animal-directed prejudice are linked, but they also share a number
of limitations. Previous studies overwhelmingly relied on participants
from English-speaking countries who were recruited from university
participant pools or online platforms, such as Amazon MTurk or Prolific
(Auger & Amiot, 2019; Caviola et al., 2019; Dhont et al., 2016; Everett
et al., 2019; Hopwood & Bleidorn, 2020; Hyers, 2006; Jackson, 2019).
That is, evidence from demographically diverse samples outside of the
Anglosphere is scare, raising questions about the generalizability of
results. To address this issue, the present studies leverage large,
demographically diverse panel data sets (Study 1: 56,759 European
participants, Study 2: 1,566 Dutch participants). Specifically, Study 1
relies on data from 46 countries, spanning Northern Europe (e.g.,
Sweden, Denmark, Iceland), Western Europe PREJUDICE ACROSS SPECIES LINES
6 (e.g., France, Ireland, Luxemburg), Eastern Europe (e.g., Russia,
Poland, Azerbaijan), and Southern Europe (e.g., Greece, Turkey,
Portugal). It is also unclear how robust the positive association
between human-directed and animaldirected prejudice is when controlling
for various socio-demographic factors. For example, men and
conservatives often show higher levels of prejudice against marginalized
groups and prejudice against animals (Caviola et al., 2019; Hodson &
Dhont, 2015) and it seems like these association are not only due to
differences in SDO (Dhont & Hodson, 2014; Graça et al., 2018). The
present studies explore (a) how various socio-demographic variables
(i.e., gender, age, educational attainment, income, rural vs. urban
living environment, religiosity, and political orientation) are related
to attitudes, beliefs, emotions, and behaviors related to the
devaluation of animals and (b) whether the link between human- and
animal-directed prejudice still emerges when controlling for these
variables. Finally, the majority of previous studies examined prejudice
towards humans and animals by measuring general attitudes and beliefs
towards these groups (e.g., Caviola et al., 2019; Dhont et al., 2016).
The present studies rely on a larger and more diverse set of attitudes,
beliefs, and emotional responses towards animals, including the
endorsement of human supremacy beliefs (Study 1), beliefs about the
ethicality and animal friendliness of animal agriculture, and feelings
of shame and guilt when thinking about meat consumption (Study 2). Study
2 also examined specific behavioral expressions of the devaluation of
animals, including participants' frequency and quantity of meat
consumption and their willingness to buy meat replacement products.
Thus, the present studies test whether the link between human- and
animal-directed prejudice generalizes across a conceptually diverse set
of operationalizations of animal-directed prejudice. In sum, the present
studies leverage large, demographically diverse panel data sets with
different operationalizations of human- and animal-directed prejudice to
provide a more severe test of the hypothesis that generalized prejudice
also extends to animals. All data and analysis scripts are available at
the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/dxrq5). Study 1 Study 1 was a
first test of the hypothesis that people who are more prejudiced towards
human social groups are also prejudiced against non-humans. This
hypothesis was tested with a large, demographically diverse,
cross-national data set with 56,759 participants from 46 European
countries. Specifically, associations between human-directed prejudice
and beliefs that humans are meant to rule over nature were examined.
Beliefs about human supremacy are key in legitimizing the domination of
animals and individual differences in these beliefs are associated with
increased meat consumption, support for the use of animals in testing,
and related outcomes (Becker et al., 2019; Dhont & Hodson, 2014; Krings
et al., 2021; Leite et al., 2019). Recent work has explored whether
there are distinct dimensions of generalized prejudice (e.g., Bergh &
Brandt, 2022, 2023). Although factor analyses provided some evidence for
a general negativity (i.e., "misanthropy") component across a large and
diverse set of target groups, results also suggest that there may be
three somewhat distinct prejudice types, representing (in the context of
the United States) prejudice against marginalized groups (e.g.,
immigrants, racial minorities), prejudice against unconventional groups
(e.g., atheists), and prejudice against privileged groups (e.g., rich
people, politicians). In the present study, prejudice towards various
human social groups was measured, allowing for operationalizations of
prejudice that differed in breadth. Specifically, the present study
could test if human supremacy beliefs are positively associated with (a)
prejudice against people from another race, which may be psychologically
closest to prejudice against animals (Caviola et al., 2019; Singer,
1975), (b) generalized prejudice against various groups that are
typically marginalized in society (e.g., immigrants, homosexuals, drug
addicts) and (c) generalized prejudice against an even larger set of
social groups, including groups that are typically not marginalized
(e.g., large families, Christians). Methods Participants. Study 1 used
data from the fourth wave of the European Values Survey, which was
administered in 2008. The EVS is a European cross-national, longitudinal
survey, which is administered approximately every ten years to
understand trends in values, attitudes, beliefs, and other indicators.
Data from a total of five waves are currently available (1981, 1990,
1999, 2008, 2017). Data from the fourth wave was chosen because it was
the only one in which human supremacy beliefs were assessed. The
integrated data set across all countries was downloaded from gesis.org.
The data set contains responses from 66,280 participants in 46 European
countries. After excluding participants with missing data on the two key
variables (human supremacy beliefs and racial prejudice), a sample of
56,759 participants was retained for analysis (Mage = 46.21, SDage =
17.83; 54.81% female, 45.19% male; see Table 1 for descriptive
statistics). Sample sizes per country ranged from 355 (Great Britain) to
1961 (Switzerland) with a median sample size of 1,276 (M = 1,234, SD =
297). Measures. Devaluation of animals was measured with a single item.
Participants indicated their agreement with the statement "Humans were
meant to rule over nature" on a fourpoint scale (agree strongly, agree,
disagree, disagree strongly). The item was reverse-coded so that higher
scores reflect stronger human supremacy beliefs. Individual differences
in prejudice were measured in three ways. Participants were shown a list
of fifteen diverse social groups (people from another race, immigrants,
Muslims, Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, people with AIDS, drug addicts,
criminals, emotionally unstable people, left wing extremists, right wing
extremists, large families, Christians, heavy drinkers) and they were
asked to indicate which of the groups they "would not like to have as a
neighbor". Groups were coded as 1 if they were mentioned and as 0 if
they were not mentioned. For the present study, three different measures
were constructed based on participants responses. Racial prejudice may
be psychologically closest to speciesist prejudice (Caviola et al.,
2019; Singer, 1975). The first prejudice measure was therefore a binary
variable indicating whether participants would not like to have a person
from another race as a neighbor. The treatment of animals is often
likened to the treatment of marginalized social groups. Therefore, a
measure of prejudice against marginalized groups was created
(McDonald\'s ω = .84), which was the total number of marginalized groups
(people from another race, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, gypsies,
homosexuals, people with AIDS, drug addicts, criminals, emotionally
unstable people) that participants would not like to have as a neighbor.
Finally, a measure of prejudice against all groups that were assessed
was created (McDonald\'s ω = .84), which was the total number of groups
that participants would not like to have as a neighbor, including groups
that are typically not marginalized (left wing extremists, right wing
extremists, large families, Christians, heavy drinkers). Several
socio-demographic variables were also recorded including participants'
sex (male or female), age, level of education, income, religiosity, and
political orientation. Educational attainment was measured by recoding
participants' highest completed education to a crossnational eight-point
scale ranging from 1 (preprimary school or no education) to 8 (second
stage of tertiary education). Income was measured by recording
participants' monthly household income in Euros (as multiples of 1000
Euros). To enable comparability across countries income was adjusted for
purchasing power parity. Due to its right-skewed distribution, the
income variable was log10-transformed. Religiosity was measured by
asking participants if they would describe themselves as a religious
person, not a religious person, or a convinced atheist (irrespective of
whether they go to church). The last two response options were combined,
creating a binary variable indicating whether participants are religious
or not. Political orientation was measured by asking participants how
they would place their political views on a ten-point scale ranging from
1 (left) to 10 (right). All continuous predictors were z-standardized
prior to analysis. Results To test the primary hypothesis, the
relationship between prejudice and human supremacy beliefs was examined
by estimating a series of multilevel regression models with random
intercepts per country using the lme4 and lmerTest packages in R. Three
different operationalizations of prejudice were: prejudice against
people from another race, prejudice against marginalized groups, and
prejudice against all fifteen groups that were assessed, including
groups that are typically not marginalized. These models thus show how
individual differences in human-directed prejudice, operationalized in
different ways, related to individual differences in human supremacy
beliefs.

**[factors]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., sex, age, education, income,

Previous work suggests that political conservatism is a strong predictor

political orientation was also included as a predictor. Identification
with the political right was positively related to human supremacy
beliefs, but there was still a positive association between racial
prejudice and human supremacy beliefs, β = 0.091, SE = 0.013, 95% CI
\[0.066, 0.118\], p \< .001 (see Table 1, Model 3).

#### High level research proves. 

**Nussbaum '23** \[Martha; January 24; M.A. '71, Ph.D. '75; Harvard
Gazette, "They can think, feel pain, love. Isn't it time animals had
rights?,"
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/01/they-can-think-feel-pain-love-isnt-it-time-animals-had-rights/\]

Recent decades, however, have seen an [[explosion of]{.mark}
**high-level [research]{.mark}** [covering]{.mark}]{.underline} all
areas of the [[animal]{.mark} world]{.underline}. We now know more not
only about animals long closely studied --- primates and companion
animals --- but also about animals who are difficult to study --- marine
mammals, whales, fish, birds, reptiles, and cephalopods.

[We know]{.underline} --- not just by observation, but [by **[carefully
designed experimental work]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [that
**[all]{.mark}** vertebrates and many invertebrates **[feel
pain]{.mark}**]{.underline} subjectively, and have, more generally, a
subjectively felt view of the world: the world looks like something to
them. We know that [all of these animals experience]{.underline} at
least some **[[emotions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (fear being the most
ubiquitous), and that many experience emotions like compassion and grief
that involve more complex "takes" on a situation. We know that animals
as different as dolphins and crows can solve complicated problems and
learn to use tools to solve them. We know that animals have complex
forms of social organization and social behavior. More recently, we have
been learning that these social groups are not simply places where a
rote inherited repertory is acted out, but places of complicated social
learning. Species as different as whales, dogs, and many types of birds
clearly transmit key parts of the species' repertoire to their young
socially, not just genetically.

What are the implications of this research for ethics? Huge, clearly.
[We [can no longer draw]{.mark} the usual [line between our]{.mark} own
[**species** and]{.mark} "the **[beasts]{.mark}**," a line meant to
distinguish intelligence, **emotion**, and **sentience** from the dense
life of a "brute beast]{.underline}." Nor can we even draw a line
between a group of animals we already recognize as sort of "like us" ---
apes, elephants, whales, dogs --- and others who are supposed to be
unintelligent. Intelligence takes multiple and fascinating forms in the
real world, and birds, evolving by a very different path from humans,
have converged on many similar abilities. Even an invertebrate such as
the octopus has surprising capacities for intelligent perception: an
[[octopus can recognize]{.mark} individual [humans]{.mark}, and can
[solve]{.mark} complex [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}, guiding one of
its arms through a maze to obtain food using only its eyes. Once we
recognize all this we can hardly be unchanged in our ethical thinking.
[To put a "**brute beast**" in a cage seems no more wrong than putting a
rock in a terrarium]{.underline}. But [that is **not** what we are
doing. We are [deforming]{.mark} the [existence of
**intelligent**]{.mark} and complexly sentient [forms of life.
Each]{.mark} of these animals [strives for a flourishing life]{.mark},
and each has abilities, **social** and individual, that equip it to
negotiate a decent life in a world that gives animals **difficult
challenges**. [What humans are doing is]{.mark} to thwart this striving
--- and this seems **[wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**It's [indefensible]{.underline}.**

[[**Speciesism** is **discrimination**]{.underline}]{.mark} only if
[[belonging to a]{.mark} certain [species is]{.mark} an
**[arbitrary]{.mark}**]{.underline}, morally [irrelevant]{.underline}
[property]{.underline}, just like belonging to a population or religious
group. Why is species membership arbitrary when it comes to e.g.
granting rights? Look at the biological classification. You can look at
it as a cabinet with several drawers. Each drawer corresponds with a way
to divide individuals into groups. I can open the bottom drawer of
ethnic groups and say that I belong to the ethnic group of white people.
Or I can open the second drawer from below, containing all subspecies,
and point at the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens as my favored group.
But we also belong to the species of humans in the third drawer. Or
moving higher in the cabinet: the family of great apes, the infraorder
of simians, the order of primates, the infraclass of placentals, the
class of mammals, the phylum of vertebrates, the kingdom of animals. We
are simian, as much as we are human and mammal. So why would we open
this third drawer from below and point at the species of humans and
declare that only those individuals get basic rights? Why not pointing
at other species or other categories such as the class of mammals?
[**[No]{.mark}ne** of the]{.underline} many [[definitions]{.mark} of
biological **species**]{.underline} (e.g. referring to the possibility
of interbreeding and getting fertile offspring) [and none of
the]{.underline} many [**descriptions** of biological
categories]{.underline} (e.g. referring to genealogy and having common
ancestors) [[contain]{.mark} any [information about who should get the
**right to live**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Why should basic rights depend
on **fertility** or **ancestry**?]{.underline}

One [could **argue** that having a **rational**]{.underline}, [moral
**self-consciousness** is]{.underline} the morally
[relevant]{.underline} property [to]{.underline} [grant]{.underline}
someone [rights]{.underline}, [and that **only** humans have such
a]{.underline} high [**level** of consciousness]{.underline}. Yet [some
humans]{.underline}, [such as **babies** or **mentally disabled**
humans]{.underline}, [have **mental capacities** not higher
than]{.underline} those of some non-human [animals]{.underline} such as
pigs (e.g. Marino and Colvin 2015). Then one could object that most
members of the species of humans do have that high level of
consciousness. But [then the **rights** of mentally
disabled]{.underline} humans [depend on **contingent** and]{.underline}
hence [**arbitrary** facts about how **many** disabled and
non-disabled]{.underline} [humans are **alive** today]{.underline}. If
the fraction of mentally disables humans increases and passes an
arbitrary threshold such as 50%, the moral status of the disabled people
should remain the same.

Furthermore, a similar concern goes for the infraorder of simians: if
there are less than 14 billion simians alive today, a majority of more
than 7 billion simians are humans with a rational, moral
self-consciousness. So why not pick this infraorder as the criterion for
membership of the moral community? One could reply that the species of
humans is the smallest biological group whose majority of members have a
high level of consciousness, but then we can ask the question why we
should pick the smallest and not the largest biological group? A rule to
pick the smallest biological group whose majority of members have a high
level of consciousness becomes very farfetched: it involves a lot of
conditions and requires a lot of specifications, such as what counts as
a biological group and a high level of consciousness. And it always
remains arbitrary: it involves many arbitrary choices such as 'smallest'
instead of 'largest', 'majority' instead of 'minority', 'high level'
instead of 'low level', 'biological group' instead of e.g. 'spatial
group'. Why pick a biological group and not simply pick the group of
individuals who have a rational, moral self-consciousness, excluding
mentally disabled humans? In the end it remains arbitrary, because what
is the relation between a biological classification and the notion of
rights?

When we look at biological groups more closely, an extra kind of
arbitrariness comes into play, because of the fuzziness of boundaries.
The idea of a species is not even well defined (e.g. Dawkins 1993). The
abovementioned cabinet was merely a misleadingly rough description of
biological reality. Suppose we jump in a time travel machine and bring
all our ancestors to the present. We put them all in a long row. You are
on the far left, then your mother, your grandmother, and so on. Moving
further down the row, we encounter for example a common ancestor of all
vertebrate animals, including chickens. Now we can descent the
genealogical tree towards a modern-day chicken. So, we have a long row
with you on the far left, a chicken on the far right, and in between all
the intermediates who once lived on this planet.

The question becomes: who along this row belongs to the moral community,
the group of people who get rights? You are fully human and get human
rights. So are your mother and your grandmother. But moving further down
the row, where does humanity end? That is an unanswerable question,
because pointing at any of the individuals will be arbitrary. There is
no sharp boundary between humans on the left and non-humans on the
right. There was no first human whose parents were not human. Our idea
of human rights and our behavior of eating chickens are based on an
arbitrary, contingent fact that those intermediates between us and
chickens no longer exist.

The [[line between **humans** and **non-human**]{.mark} animals [is
**blurred**]{.mark}]{.underline} in many other ways. First, it is not
unlikely that a human-chimpanzee hybrid can be born, just as horsedonkey
(mules), lion-leopard, camel-lama, dolphin-killer whale and sheep-goat
hybrids can exist (see the Wikipedia list of genetic hybrids). Those
hybrids are often infertile, but their body cells contain the DNA of two
different species. Second, scientists could create human-animal chimera:
an embryo, part of its body contained pig cells with 100% pig DNA, the
other contained human cells with human DNA (Wu 2017). The body cells of
chimeras can range from 100% human to 100% non-human. Do we need a
minimum percentage of human cells before we grant someone human rights?
Third, the biological possibility of genetic modification also blurs the
line between species in new ways. What if we take a human genome and
replace some human genes with nonhuman animal genes?

[Where to draw the **line** of humanity?]{.underline} Scientists will
[never]{.underline} be [able to propose **criteria** to
determine]{.underline} [whether beings]{.underline} such as ancestors,
hybrids, chimeras and genetically manipulated persons [should
be]{.underline} [called]{.underline} '[human]{.underline}', just as
scientists are never able to determine when objects should be called
'hot'. There is [nothing **essential** about a biological **group** such
as a species]{.underline}. [[Thinking that a species
has]{.underline}]{.mark} a kind of essence, [[an **intrinsic**
property]{.underline}]{.mark} or trait that all members and only members
of the species poses, [[is an **illusion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.3

[No such **essences** have **ever** been found]{.underline}, and
evolutionary theory explains why species essences do not exist (Hull
1965; Sober 1980; Barker 2010; Ereshefski 2010; Lewens 2012).
[Speciesists]{.underline} are [challenged]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
the question of the moral status of **[[boundary
cases]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as ancestors, hybrids, chimeras and
genetically modified humanlike beings. The group [boundaries
[are]{.mark} **[fuzzy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which [makes a rule to
[**discriminate** on the basis of **species**]{.mark} very
**complicated** and **farfetched**]{.underline}. As long as fuzzy
boundaries are possible, [[**arbitrariness** lurks]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Boundary cases introduce arbitrariness in cut-off points. Moral rules
concerning who gets rights should not depend on arbitrary, contingent
facts about whether or not there are only paradigm cases (exemplary
humans) with sharp instead of fuzzy boundaries between groups.

We can say that **[[speciesism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, just like racism,
[[is]{.mark} morally **[wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline} in two ways. First,
the [[biological concepts]{.underline}]{.mark} of species and race [[are
**vague**]{.mark} and not **precise**]{.underline}. What about mixed
races and hybrids? [[When is someone]{.underline}]{.mark} 'white enough'
or '**[[human]{.mark} [enough]{.mark}]{.underline}**'? Second, [even
if]{.underline} race and [species were clear **categories**]{.underline}
defined by essentialist properties, [they would still be morally
**irrelevant** because the basic [rights do not]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[refer to]{.mark} those **[categories]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[right to live only]{.mark} [refers to being
**alive**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not to being white. The [[right
to]{.underline}]{.mark} bodily [[autonomy only refers to having a
body]{.mark} and an autonomy]{.underline}, [not to having a **human
body**]{.underline}. There is no basic right to X, where X is an
expression that explicitly refers to e.g. being human or being white.

#### Species-neutral valuations are the most ethical\-\--prioritizing humans is [arbitrary]{.underline}, clearly [self-interested]{.underline}, and the [same logic]{.underline} as racism and sexism.

[Some people have attempted to overcome]{.underline}, or rather
side-step, [this problem by simply stipulating that it is human beings
that matter]{.underline} (see Warnock 1983). Although this move
certainly avoids the problem, it does so at some cost. [[It is difficult
to]{.mark} imagine how one would [defend a moral
theory]{.mark}]{.underline} [that was [founded on]{.mark} the
stipulation of [an **arbitrary**]{.mark} **(and totally unjustified)
[preference]{.mark}** [for one]{.mark} kind of [creature over
another]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly when this preference is
asserted by self-interested individuals on behalf of their own
kind]{.underline}. [[We are]{.mark} all too [familiar with the]{.mark}
sordid and disreputable [history of similar claims]{.mark} in which the
moral priority and superiority of \"our own kind\" has been asserted on
behalf of Greeks at the expense of barbarians, [white]{.mark}s [over
black]{.mark}s, [Nazis over Jews]{.mark}, and [men over
women]{.mark}]{.underline}. Simply [stipulating arbitrarily the
[superiority]{.mark} of our own kind, whether [defined by
species]{.mark}]{.underline} membership, race, gender, nationality,
religion, [or any other nonmoral characteristic is, and [has always
been, **disreputable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Membership of a natural
kind, or of an ethnic, religious or other grouping, is not of itself a
moral property.

Potentiality

The problem is to distinguish in some morally significant respect, human
embryos from the embryos and indeed the adult members of any other
species. Species membership is not enough because human embryos seem not
to differ, except in species membership and in one other feature that I
will discuss in a moment, from the embryos and indeed adult members of
other species. Unlike adult members of many other species they are not
conscious, although they may become so at some stage during their
development. The one thing human embryos have that members of other
species do not is their potential not simply to be born and to be human,
but to become the sort of complex, intelligent, self-conscious,
multifaceted creatures typical of the human species. There are, however,
two fatal difficulties for the potentiality argument.

Two Problems with Potentiality

The logical difficulty. The logical difficulty is straightforward but
telling. We are asked to accept that human embryos or fetuses are
persons, morally important beings whose interests trump those of other
sorts of beings, in virtue of their potential to become another sort of
being. But it does not follow logically, even if we accept that we are
required to treat 'x' in certain ways, and even if 'a' will inevitably
become 'x,' that we must treat 'a' as if it had become 'x,' at a time or
at a stage prior to its having become 'x'. This is a rather cumbersome
and inelegant way of making the point that acorns are not oak trees, nor
eggs omelettes. Anyone reading this essay shares with its author one
very important, inescapable potential. \[End Page 297\] We are both
potentially dead, however, I hope neither of us is required to concede
that it is therefore appropriate for anyone to treat us now, as if we
already were dead. Further, it should be noted that the reader and I
have this potential with far greater certainty than does the human
embryo have the potential to become a glorious, sophisticated adult
member of the human species.

The scope of potential for personhood. The second difficulty with the
potentiality argument involves the scope of the potential for
personhood. If the human zygote has the potential to become an adult
human being and is supposedly morally important in virtue of that
potential, then what of the potential to become a zygote? Something has
the potential to become a zygote, and whatever has the potential to
become the zygote has whatever potential the zygote has. It follows that
the unfertilized egg and the sperm, taken together, but as yet
un-united, also have the potential to become fully functioning adult
humans. It is sometimes objected that the individual sperm that will
fertilize the egg is not identifiable in advance of conception. I am not
sure why this is an objection, and it is true that in normal
reproduction the identity of the sperm that will successfully fertilize
the egg is unpredictable. But the identity of the sperm is not
necessarily opaque. The technique known as ICSI (Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm
Injection) does identify the individual sperm prior to fertilization.

In addition, it is theoretically possible to stimulate eggs, including
human eggs, to divide and develop without fertilization
(parthenogenesis). As yet it has not been possible to continue the
development process artificially beyond early stages of embryogenesis,
but if it becomes possible then unfertilized eggs themselves, without
need of sperm or cloning (see below), also would have the potential of
the zygote.

Finally, cloning by nuclear transfer, which involves deleting the
nucleus of an unfertilized egg, inserting the nucleus taken from any
adult cell, and electrically stimulating the resulting newly created egg
to develop, can, in theory, produce a new human. This means that any
cell from a normal human body has the potential to become a new "twin"
of that individual. All that is needed is an appropriate environment and
appropriate stimulation. But this of course is true of normal
reproduction. The zygote only has the potential to become an adult
member of the species if placed in the appropriate environment and
treated thereafter in appropriate and complex ways. The techniques of
parthenogenesis and cloning by nuclear substitution mean that conception
is no longer the necessary precursor of human beings. \[End Page 298\]

Thus if the argument from potential is understood to afford protection
and moral status to whatever has the potential to grow into a normal
adult human being, then potentially every human cell deserves
protection. I shall not be concerned to refute such an ethic here, but
will simply note that it is a very exhausting ethic.

What is important about potential?

The account of potentiality given here and elsewhere has been criticized
for its simplicity. John Finnis (1995, p. 50), for example, has argued
that: "\[a\]n organic capacity for developing eye-sight is not 'the bare
fact that something will become' sighted; it is an existing reality, a
thoroughly unitary ensemble of dynamically inter-related primordia of,
bases and structures for, development." He concludes that "there is no
sense whatever in which the unfertilized ovum and that sperm constitute
one organism, a dynamic unity, identity, whole."

On the other hand, the account of potential I have outlined treats
potentiality as a rather more straightforward idea. A has the potential
for Z if, when a certain number of things do and do not happen to A (or
to A plus N), then A or A plus N will become Z. For even a "unitary
ensemble of dynamically inter-related primordia of, bases and structures
for development" must have a certain number of things happen to it and a
certain number of things that do not happen to it if its potential is to
be actualized. If this monstrous beast of Finnis's is a zygote, it must
implant, be nourished, and have a genetic constitution compatible with
survival to term and beyond. Why, the list of things that must happen in
normal reproduction, should not also include fertilization is unclear to
me.

Moreover Finnis's insistence on a "unitary ensemble," on "one organism,"
seems vulnerable to cloning by nuclear substitution. For any of Finnis's
skin cells, if treated appropriately, might be cloned. As Julian
Savulescu (1999, p. 91) has recently reminded us, "What happens when a
skin cell turns into a totipotent stem cell is that a few of its genetic
switches are turned on and others are turned off. To say it doesn't have
the potential to be a human being until its nucleus is placed in the egg
cytoplasm is like saying my car does not have the potential to get me
from Melbourne to Sydney unless the key is turned in the ignition."

Most importantly, however, Finnis's objections, and those of a similar
kind, miss the main point of the argument from potential. The
potentiality of something, or some things, has moral importance on the
assumption \[End Page 299\] that actualizing a particular potential is
what matters. We would not worry about what precisely it is that has the
potential to be a person, or an adult human being, if persons or adult
humans did not matter. We are only interested in the potentiality
argument because we are interested in the potential to become a
particular, and particularly valuable, sort of thing. If, as I suggested
above, the zygote (Finnis's unitary ensemble) is important because it
has the potential for personhood, and that is what makes it a matter of
importance to protect and actualize its potential; then whatever has the
potential to become a zygote must also be morally significant for the
same reason. Those with their "eyes on the prize," value potentiality
for personhood, not because the potential is contained within "one
organism," but because it is the potential to become something the
actualisation of which has moral importance.

Gradualism

Another approach to the question of when human life becomes morally
important is the gradualist approach to moral status. It is suggested
that since we know that a morally important person will almost
certainly, eventually emerge, it is appropriate to accord a gradually
increasing moral status to the embryo or fetus. This view is attractive
and has about it the classic air of political compromise. However, if we
know why, in virtue of what, it is that normal human adults possess
personhood, then we will in principle be able to gauge more precisely
when these features, whatever they are, might with some plausibility be
said to be present in the emerging individual. Furthermore, if, as I
suggest later, personhood turns out to be a threshold concept, then
proximity to the threshold is unimportant compared with the importance
of crossing it, and there is no justification for taking a gradualist
approach to personhood or moral status.

Brain Birth

Finally, Michael Lockwood (1988) has suggested an elegant solution to
the problem of when morally important life begins. Noting that "brain
death" is an almost universally accepted criterion of death, and hence
of the termination of the moral status of the individual, he has
proposed that "brain birth" might be a sensible point at which to date
the genesis of moral status. The problem is that "brain death," although
almost universally accepted as a criterion of death, seems less
acceptable as a criterion of loss of moral status. Discussion of why
this is so is postponed, \[End Page 300\] however, until the
consideration of a case of persistent vegetative state in the
penultimate section of this paper.

The Meaning of Life

Let us step aside for a moment from the previous concerns and consider
the question "what is the meaning of life?" rather than "what is it that
gives moral status or ultimate value to life?"

Philosophers, of this century at least, have generally shied away from
this sort of question, except, that is, for the distinguished and much
underrated Douglas Adams. In his seminal trilogy, "The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy," Adams (1972, Ch. 27) conducted a famous thought
experiment. He imagined a race of beings that wished to solve the
ultimate question, the question of the meaning of "life, the universe
and everything," and to this end constructed a hyper-intelligent
computer to solve the problem. After seven and a half million years, the
computer came back with the answer "42." This answer is illuminating in
an interesting way. Clearly it seems unsatisfactory as an answer to the
question: "What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?"
However, the problem with criticizing the answer is that we have not the
most rudimentary of idea of what a more plausible (less outrageous)
answer might look like. We seem to lack a perspective from which to
criticize any answer offered.

Nonhuman Persons

If we turn now from this question of the meaning of life to questions of
its value and ultimate status, things are rather different. Here we do
seem to have a perspective, not only from which to criticize possible
answers to the question, but from which to construct our own answer.
[Consider the question of whether there are **persons on other
planets**]{.underline}. Although we do not know the answer to this
question, we do know what would convince us that we had found an
affirmative answer. [We have, in the back of our minds at least, an idea
of what we are looking for when we look for people]{.underline}, or
evidence of people, on other planets. Let us be clear, however, about
what we are *not* looking for.

First, [we are not looking exclusively or primarily, for human beings.
We do not expect persons on other planets]{.underline}, if there are
any, necessarily [to be members of our own species]{.underline}. Second,
we are not necessarily even looking for organic life forms, it may be
that we will become convinced that self-constructing machines of
sufficient intelligence would count as persons. Third, we are not
looking for nonpersonal life forms, although we may also find these and
be excited if we do. Neither are we looking for the sort of machinery
that would not count as a person (perhaps machinery left behind by
persons long since deceased).

[These observations show us that [we do not]{.mark}, in fact, [regard
**species membership** as]{.mark} hugely [significant]{.mark} in trying
[to understand]{.mark} what [a person]{.mark} might be]{.underline}. Nor
even do we require that persons be organic life forms. What then are we
looking for? What should convince us that we had discovered persons on
other planets?

Suppose, that instead of us discovering persons on other planets, they
discovered us. Demonstrating their vastly superior technology by
arriving on Earth having traversed unimaginable interstellar distances,
the extraterrestrials are hungry and tired after their long journey.
What could we point to about ourselves that ought to convince the
extra-terrestrials that they had discovered persons, morally significant
beings of special importance, on another planet? What could we say of
ourselves that should convince them of the appropriateness of \"having
us for dinner\" in one sense rather than another? What should convince
them to treat us as dinner guests rather than the dinner itself? What
makes for a moral distinction between ourselves and, say, lettuces or
turnips?

Toward the end of the seventeenth century in his \"Essay Concerning
Human Understanding\" the philosopher John [Locke]{.underline} attempted
to answer this question in a way that has scarcely been surpassed. He
[wrote]{.underline}:

> [[We must consider what person **stands for**]{.mark}; which I think
> is [a thinking]{.mark} intelligent [being]{.mark}, that has reason and
> reflection, and can consider itself the same thinking thing, in
> different times and places; which it does only by that consciousness
> which is inseparable from thinking and seems to me essential to
> it]{.underline}; it being impossible for anyone to perceive without
> perceiving that he does perceive. (Locke 1690, Ch. 27, Book II, p.
> 188)

It seems to me [that it is]{.underline} [beings possessing these
capacities]{.underline}, or something closely akin to them, [that we are
looking for when we ask the question \"Are there persons on other
planets?\" And [we must hope]{.mark} that [if]{.mark} it is [others
of]{.mark} vastly [superior tech]{.mark}nology that [are asking the
question, that they recognize in]{.mark} us **[fellow creatures of moral
standing]{.mark}**, fellow persons. [It is a **species-neutral**
description]{.mark} but it identifies those features, the potential for
which is so important to the failed potentiality argument and the

### Factory Farms\-\--AT: Neuron Count

#### Neuron count is irrelevant

Counting the [[number of **neurons**]{.underline}]{.mark}

One common way trying to approximate the moral status of different
animals is assuming each individual has some fixed capacity for
wellbeing in fixed proportion to the number of neurons they have.144

This substantially changes how we compare animals to humans.145

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
              Total population   Neurons per     Total neurons across the
                                 animal          population
  ----------- ------------------ --------------- -------------------------
  Humans      8 billion          85 billion      700 quintillion

  Chickens    24 billion         220 million     5 quintillion

  Pigs        1 billion          430 million     0.5 quintillion

  Cows        1.5 billion        6 billion       9 quintillion

  Farmed fish 100 billion to 180 10 million      1 to 2 quintillion
              billion                            
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

While this method is [simple, and [tempting]{.mark}]{.underline}, we
think there are lots of good objections to using solely neuron counts as
proxies to moral weight. These objections focus on showing that while
neuron count probably does correlate with the amount of moral
consideration you should give an animal, these [[correlations are very
imperfect]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, there are a [large number
of studies showing that **[decreased brain volume]{.mark}** can
[increase]{.mark} the [**intensity** of]{.mark} experiences]{.underline}
(like chronic **[[pain]{.underline}]{.mark}**) in humans.146

As a result, we think we [can't conclude much just from neuron
counts]{.underline}, other than that we should probably give somewhat
more consideration to humans than to nonhuman animals. The extent of
that additional moral consideration remains unclear --- and [neuron
counts seem a poor proxy.]{.underline}

#### Neuron count irrelevant to intelligence

There are other things to note about this approach. First, though there
is some [question about which precise **metric** to use as a
proxy]{.underline}, the previous section demonstrated that whichever
metric we choose will not align perfectly with common sense. [[Elephants
have **three times** as many neurons as humans]{.mark} and have **bigger
brains**]{.underline}. [[Shrews]{.mark} have [greater
**brain-to-body**]{.mark} **ratios**]{.underline}. Some [new-world
monkeys have a **[greater encephalization]{.mark}**
quotient]{.underline} than certain great apes. So, at the very least, it
is clear that [neuron [counts **do not**]{.mark}]{.underline} infallibly
[[track]{.mark} commonsense **intuitions** about [moral
status]{.mark}.]{.underline} We have evidence that any metric will
diverge from common sense intuitions in certain cases. However, it might
still be thought that neuron counts are close enough to tracking such
intuitions that they can be useful in certain contexts, just as
consumption might be a highly fallible but nevertheless still helpful
measure of human welfare in economics. How closely neuron counts track
our intuitions might depend on how "rough" of a rough measure we are
looking for. 

Finally, one might question whether we should place much stock in our
[common sense [intuitions]{.mark}]{.underline} about nonhuman animals.
[Humans have a **long history** of assigning **special value** to their
own characteristics and [mak]{.mark}ing **[bad assumptions]{.mark}**
about]{.underline} the uniqueness and importance of [human
traits]{.underline}. It seems very likely that our [**intuitions** about
[moral weight are **biased** to]{.mark}wards those [things that **we
value**]{.mark} as parts of our distinctively human lives.]{.underline}
Beyond just our anthropocentric biases, we also have other biases that
often lead us astray. Consider a hypothetical proposal that moral weight
should be assigned based on cuteness. We might check our intuitions and
find that chimpanzees are more cute than pigs, who are more cute than
chickens, who are more cute than shrimp, etc. But clearly, this is a
poor way of reasoning, and there's a fairly straightforward scientific
story to tell about how these biases are simply a relic of the types of
faces and features humans have been designed to respond to through
evolution. It is therefore important not to place too much weight on the
intellectual equivalents of "cuteness" in our evaluations of moral
weight. The point is not that all intuitions about moral status are
necessarily as unreliable as those that closely track cuteness, but
rather that we should be cautious about assuming that agreement with
pretheoretical intuitions is a strong point in favor of a view,
particularly if those intuitions are likely to come from people who may
be influenced by a lot of assumptions built into the current culture. 

#### This is scientific consensus

**Shriver '22** \[Adam; November 28; PhD from the

First, consider the [**empirical ev**idence]{.underline}. It can be
[[**tempting** to look at]{.mark} a brain imaging study]{.underline},
such as Rainville et al. 1999, that [showed that increased
activation]{.underline} in the anterior cingulate and insula are
correlated with increases in [reported unpleasantness of
pain]{.underline}, and [conclude that "more [neurons]{.mark} firing" in
those regions leads to more pain]{.underline} unpleasantness, and
therefore we can use the number of neurons in pain regions as a proxy
for total welfare capacity. This, however, [is a
**[mistake]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As noted above, [the
[scientists]{.mark} studying brain imaging patterns of pain are [**very
clear** that these]{.mark} [patterns can only]{.mark} be used to
[identify]{.mark} the intensity of [pain]{.mark} or pain unpleasantness
**[within individuals.]{.mark}**]{.underline} It is [**[not]{.mark} a
measure** that can be used **to make comparisons** [across
individuals]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is, you cannot look at one
individual and say this person has more ACC and insula neurons active
during pain and therefore they experience more pain than another
individual who has fewer neurons active. Studies looking at individual
differences in the experience of pain tend to focus on the robustness
and likelihood of activation in particular regions, but they do not
simply focus on the total amount of activation in particular regions to
make comparisons across individuals. In other words, one individual
might be "more sensitive" to pain because their affective pain regions
are more likely to be activated for an identical stimulus, but they are
not considered to be "in more pain" merely because they have more
neurons active when both patients are showing strong activation, aside
from at a very coarse-grained level of comparison. Some potential
reasons for this will be discussed below.

But equally important, neuroimaging researchers are highly invested in
finding an objective biomarker for pain, and in being able to predict
individual differences in pain responses. They have performed hundreds
of experiments looking at brain activation during pain. The current
[**[consensus]{.mark}** is that there [is **no**]{.mark}t yet a
[**reliable way** of identifying pain]{.mark} across conditions merely
[by]{.mark} [looking at brain scans]{.mark},]{.underline} and
[**[no]{.mark} leading [neuroscientists]{.mark}** have [said]{.mark}
anything that suggests that the **mere number** of [neurons]{.mark} in a
particular region [is predictive]{.mark} of "how much pain" a person
might experience]{.underline}. I think this is compelling evidence that
the claim that ["more pain neurons = more pain" is **not suggested** by
currently available evidence]{.underline}. It might, of course, turn out
to be the case that there exists a subset of neurons in particular
neural circuits that really do have this relationship with pain, and
which haven't yet been identified due to the limited spatial resolution
of brain imaging, but it seems ill-advised to put any weight on this
idea in the absence of any substantial evidence.

### Factory Farms\-\--AT: MCE

#### Factory farming will continue

Here's a [graph of the tonnes of meat consumed each year:]{.underline}

![A graph of a graph showing the growth of meat AI-generated content may

height="4.5881944444444445in"}

The [[number of animals]{.mark} being [slaughtered is
**increasing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is [also true for fish
farming:]{.underline}

![A graph of a fish market AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image2.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.5881944444444445in"}

It seems likely that [trends will be **similar for
shellfish**]{.underline} and other invertebrates (there's a nascent and
growing insect farming industry).154

Ultimately, we'd guess this trend is primarily [[caused by]{.mark} the
[human **population getting bigger**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[[**richer**,]{.mark} [increasing]{.mark} the [demand]{.mark} for
meat.]{.underline}

The number of animals on factory farms isn't increasing as much in
developed countries. This is probably primarily because their
populations aren't growing as much. It also seems that as income per
capita increases, meat consumption per capita also increases --- but
possibly only up to a point. In a few countries, meat consumption per
capita is now falling.155 We're not quite sure why this is, but we'd
guess that, in part, as people get rich enough, they start being more
willing to do things like change their diets in response to climate,
health, or animal welfare concerns.

But overall, it looks like meat consumption --- particularly from fish
and chickens --- is going to continue to substantially increase in the
short term.

We think roughly [all of this increased [demand will be **met by factory
farming**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- as opposed to bucolic family farms
--- since it's by far the [[**cheapest** way]{.mark} to produce
meat]{.underline}, and probably the only way to produce meat at the
scale being demanded without turning most of the planet into grassland.

This could be changed by regulations. Some countries have passed
[[laws]{.mark} to protect the welfare]{.underline} of some farmed
animals --- but these [are far from universal, are **[poorly
enforced]{.mark}**, and usually are only small initial
steps.]{.underline}

### Factory Farms\-\--Gene Drives\-\--Neg

#### Genetic editing will proliferate existing suffering. 

**Ridgway '22** \[Tim; July 28; BA of Anthropology @ University of
Durham; "Gene Editing: What Is It And How Will It Affect Animals?"
https://animalequality.org.uk/blog/gene-editing-farmed-animals/\] sajad

A recent report by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics -- which is an
independent body that examines and reports on ethical issues in biology
and medicine -- has warned [that [**gene editing** could
"accelerate]{.mark}]{.underline} some existing [[**unethical** breeding
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}".

The unethical breeding practices that the report refers to is the use of
[**[selective breeding]{.mark}** across the farming
industry]{.underline} which has led to devastating results for animals.

Selective breeding is when [[two]{.mark} specific [animals]{.mark} are
chosen]{.underline} for mating in order [to **[create
offspring]{.mark}** with '[desirable']{.mark}
characteristics]{.underline} (desirable, not necessarily for the animals
themselves, but in this case for the animal agriculture industry's
profitability). For example, the chicken industry has been selecting the
fastest growing chickens and using them for breeding, resulting in new
chickens which grow even faster.

This process has been repeated over decades and now chickens in factory
farms reach a weight of 2.2kg in just 35 days -- almost a 400% increase
compared to a century ago. 

This has [[**significant** consequences for]{.mark} the [chickens'
**health**]{.mark}]{.underline}, causing them to [suffer from [**heart
attacks**, organ failure]{.mark} and debilitating [leg
deformities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Around 95% of the chickens bred and
killed for their flesh in the UK are fast-growing. This is all legal and
happening without Government intervention.

Animal Equality has documented the suffering chickens face in numerous
investigations into UK factory farms.

Given the meat industry's track record with selective breeding, it's
[[wishful thinking]{.mark} to expect]{.underline} that [[**gene
editing** will lead to anything other than]{.mark} more
[suffering]{.mark}]{.underline} for animals, especially when there is
[even [**more money** to be made]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Government has also made suggestions that [gene editing
technology]{.underline} could be [used to promote [animal
welfare]{.mark}]{.underline} by creating animals who are less likely to
suffer on factory farms. But this is [also **[wishful
thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

One example given is that pigs could be engineered to be born without
tails to end the use of a practice known as 'tail docking'. Tail docking
is a widespread practice where farm workers cut off pigs' tails. It is
usually done with a sharp instrument such as pliers or clippers and
without pain relief.

The [[conditions on]{.underline}]{.mark} intensive factory [[farms
are]{.mark} deeply **[unnatural]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with many [pigs
resorting to biting the tails]{.underline} of other pigs out of
frustration, anxiety and boredom. This is [very painful]{.underline}.

[The **[meat industry]{.mark}** could [solve]{.mark}]{.underline} the
problem [[by giving]{.mark} the animals **[more
space]{.mark}**]{.underline} and and a more natural environment, [but
[this would **cost money**]{.mark}]{.underline} and reduce profits.
Instead, it cuts corners by opting for tail docking at the expense of
pigs.

Now, the meat industry [may [look to gene editing]{.mark} technology [as
a]{.mark} new [fix. But]{.mark}]{.underline} creating pigs without tails
[[won't solve]{.mark} the **[underlying]{.mark} problem**: the terrible
factory farm [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be [just a
cosmetic fix]{.underline} and pigs would still be left to suffer in
horrible factory farm conditions.

In the end, [[gene editing **will not** do anything]{.mark} to
address]{.underline} the fact that the meat industry's [[ultimate
objective is to **make money**]{.mark} by exploiting
animals]{.underline}. The Government is simply putting a more powerful
tool in the hands of an abusive industry and animals will suffer even
more than they already do as a result.

### Factory Farms\-\--AT: Fake Meat

#### Fake meat technologically impossible

**Hilton '24** \[Benjamin; July; Masters in Theoretical Physics and
Economics, former policy advisor in the UK government cabinet; 80,000

There are [three broad approaches to]{.underline} creating
[alternatives]{.underline} to animal products:

[[Plant-based]{.mark} alternatives]{.underline}, made solely using
ingredients from plants and fungi

[[Fermentation]{.mark} methods]{.underline} (also known as acellular
agriculture), which use microorganisms to create proteins usually found
in animal products

[[Cultivated meat]{.underline}]{.mark} (also known as cellular
agriculture), which produces a product cellularly identical to animal
meat through cultivating animal cells directly

Each of these approaches [[face]{.mark}s **major
[challenges]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Plant-based and fermentation methods face difficult challenges in
**[reaching parity]{.mark}**]{.underline} with animal products [[on
**taste, texture**]{.mark}, and on getting plant-based meat to cook like
mea]{.underline}t.158 Fermentation methods produce individual proteins
rather than complete products, but combining these animal proteins that
aren't available in plants with plant-based products may overcome some
of these challenges.

Ultimately, we'd guess that [as long as there are **substantial
[chemical differences]{.mark}**]{.underline} between meat and its
alternatives, [there will be reasons not to switch]{.underline}. For
example, [people may have worries about health or **chemical
additives**, or feel **put off** by differences]{.underline} in what the
product looks like, feels like, or how it cooks. This is one reason why
people are working on cultivated meat.

A 2020 report by David Humbird into cultured meat sparked
controversy with its claims that there are [**[severe technical
challenges]{.mark}** to growing cultivated meat at scale]{.underline}.
Humbird's arguments include:

The [[**low growth rate** of animal cells]{.underline}]{.mark}
(especially [[compared to]{.mark} possible infectious [microbial
cells]{.mark}]{.underline}) [means producers [need]{.mark} to take
**[expensive]{.mark} measures** to ensure a [**sterile**
environment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It's [**[difficult to transfer oxygen]{.mark}** into, and waste out of,
a bioreactor [without rupturin]{.mark}g animal
[cells]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this will [limit the
volume]{.underline} ([and thus cost-efficiency]{.underline}) of
bioreactors.

[Scaling up the industry producing the [raw
ingredient]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} ([amino acids]{.underline}
and/or plant protein hydrolysates) [will be **[extremely
expensive.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

We read the full report, along with some responses to it (by the Good
Food Institute and by Rethink Priorities) --- and ultimately were
reasonably convinced that these challenges are real.

#### Even if it works\-\--people don't buy it 

**Hilton '24** \[Benjamin; July; Masters in Theoretical Physics and

Would a competitive meat alternative end factory farming, and if so ---
when?

There's [**[more]{.mark}** to consider [than just]{.mark} the
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology. [If we have the
tech]{.underline}nology for products that are competitive with meat on
their price, taste, and convenience, would that lead to the end of
factory farming? If so, [how long would that take?]{.underline}

It's pretty unclear.

First, it's important to remember that making a real dent in meat
consumption [[require]{.mark}s building up **[new
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We [currently consume around **1
million tons** of meat every]{.underline} single [day]{.underline}.
[Building up a replacement for that would be a **gigantic
project**]{.underline}. Humbird estimates that it would [[cost
**hundreds of millions**]{.mark} of dollars]{.underline} to build a
facility [[to replace]{.mark} **less than [0.01%]{.mark}** [of the
world's meat]{.mark}]{.underline}.159

There are also lots of other factors that might affect whether people
will switch, like [social **[norms, familiarity]{.mark}**, food
**[safety]{.mark}**, and **[religion]{.mark}.**]{.underline}160 These
factors are much harder to predict --- for example, it's possible that
the development of alternatives to animal products [[causes **political
polarisation**]{.mark} and **[worse animal policy
overall]{.mark}**]{.underline} (although we'd guess that's less likely
than the opposite).

So, what does all this mean for the future of meat production?

It's pretty hard to bring this information together into a meaningful
prediction. We've seen two attempts to do this.

On Metaculus, a forecasting website, the aggregate of 268
predictions suggests there's a 12% chance of a 50% decline in global
meat production by 2040.

Rethink Priorities brought together a **[panel of
[forecasters]{.mark}]{.underline}** to [[predict]{.mark}]{.underline}
how likely it is we'll have specifically cultivated meat [[by]{.mark}
20[51]{.mark}]{.underline}. Aggregating their estimates suggests that,
while there's an around 50% chance of us producing over 100,000 tons per
year by then, there's more like a **[[9% chance
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** us producing over [**[50 million]{.mark}
tons** per year]{.underline}. (For comparison, [we
[produced]{.mark} around [350]{.mark} million tons of meat [in]{.mark}
20[22]{.mark}.]{.underline})

### Factory Farms\-\--AT: Transhumanism 

#### It\'s a [scientific nonstarter]{.underline}, based in [flawed logic]{.underline}, AND [worsens performance]{.underline}.

**Levin '22** \[Susan; March 22; Professor in Humanities and Philosophy
at Smith College; Slate, "Silicon Valley's Favorite Weird Philosophy Is
Fundamentally Wrong,"

You're probably already familiar with certain enhancements---like
[athletes using **steroids**]{.underline} to gain a competitive
advantage, or [individuals using **ADHD** drugs like Ritalin and
**Adderall** off label in search of a **cognitive boost**]{.underline}.
But [a chasm separates such enhancements from transhumanism, whose
devotees would have us engineer a species-level upgrade of humanity into
posthumanity]{.underline}. And key to all of transhumanism's planned
advancements, mental and physical, is a specific understanding of
"information" and its causal dominance in relation to features that
advocates prize. This [focus on information is also transhumanism's
**fatal flaw**]{.underline}.

Arguably, [transhumanism's [closest antecedent is]{.mark}]{.underline}
Anglo-American **[[eugenics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, inaugurated by
Francis Galton, who coined the term eugenics in 1883. Among the many
substantive parallels between transhumanism and Anglo-American eugenics
are an insistence that science set humanity's guiding aspirations and
that human intelligence and moral attitudes (such as altruism and
self-control) require major, biological augmentation. The [term
transhumanism was **first used** by a British eugenicist]{.underline},
Julian Huxley (also the brother of Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New
World). [Transhumanism]{.underline} as we know it, however[, is a
[marriage]{.mark} of sorts [between **substantive commitments** shared
with]{.mark} Anglo-American [eugenics and]{.mark} the [notion that
living things and machines are]{.mark} basically [alike]{.mark}---the
latter stemming from developments in computing and information theory
during and after **World War II**]{.underline}.

Here, the key idea is that animate entities and machines are, in
essence, information, their operations fundamentally the same. From this
perspective, brains are computational devices, genetic causality works
through "programs," and the informational patterns constituting us are,
in principle, translatable to the digital realm. This informational lens
is the crux of transhumanism---its scientific convictions and confidence
in prospects for humanity's technological self-transcendence into
posthumanity.

Some of [transhumanism's [**greatest promises** rest on]{.mark} the
[assumption that genes]{.mark}, as information, drive and dominate
people's standing in relation to complex **phenotypic traits**, such as
intelligence, self-control, kindness, and empathy: in other words, that
they "**code for**" these features]{.underline}. Thus
construed---[transhumanists assure us]{.underline}---[these traits [are
**manipulable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The roots of these ideas go back
more than 50 years. For instance, in The Logic of Life (1970), François
Jacob announced that, "with the accumulation of knowledge, man has
become the first product of evolution capable of controlling evolution."
Jacob's expectation of boosts to complex mental features, once we
pinpoint "the genetic factors involved"---in other words, attain due
familiarity with the informational "mechanisms" playing key roles in
their causation---is palpable in transhumanism. Today, however, [the
perspective represented]{.underline} by Jacob [is increasingly rejected
by scientists, philosophers of science, and historians]{.underline}.

That genes influence human features is not in question. Where
transhumanists err is in the disproportionate role assigned to genes in
creating their favored traits. In contrast to clear-cut physical
features, such as eye color, the relationship of genetic "information"
to characteristics such as intelligence and kindness is nuanced and
indirect. Today, developmental systems theory supersedes the dominant,
unidirectional causality previously lodged with genes. From this vantage
point, development spans a range of levels and a wealth of factors,
biological and nonbiological, that interact in complex ways. Crucially,
as philosopher of science Susan Oyama observes, none of these
factors---genes included---"is privileged a priori as the bearer of
fundamental form or as the origin of ultimate causal control"; rather,
"everything \[the\] organism does and is rises out of this interactive
complex, even as it affects that very complex."

[Transhumanists' understanding of the brain [is]{.mark} **similarly
[flawed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Their [[presumption that]{.mark}
particular [mental capacities are tethered to **specific areas**]{.mark}
of the brain---and could, therefore, be targeted for manipulation---[is
**increasingly outdated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, a [monumental
shift in the focus of neuroscientific research]{.underline}, from
discrete areas with dedicated functions to complex functional networks,
[is well underway]{.underline}. As is now well documented, mental tasks
such as attention, memory, and creativity engage numerous areas of the
brain; individual regions are pluripotent, meaning that they have
multiple roles; and various areas function as "hubs." To give but one
example, as neuroscientist Luiz Pessoa observes, the amygdala, long
deemed a strictly emotional area---tied to the processing of
fear-related information in particular---"is increasingly recognized as
playing important roles in cognitive, emotional, and social processes."

[Transhumanists' **outdated conceptualization** of the brain also drives
their claim that elevating quantities of individual hormones and
neurotransmitters makes us better thinkers and **more
moral**]{.underline}. Though trivial for them in its own right,
[transhumanists see off-label usage of psychostimulants by those seeking
**cognitive boosts** as practical proof of concept for more dramatic
cognitive **enhancement**]{.underline}. Yet substantial research on task
performance [when subjects are given psychostimulants reveals cognitive
**trade-offs** between memory and attention, and attention and
flexibility]{.underline}. This research also documents what are called
"baseline-dependent effects" on tasks including memory and creativity:
While the performance of those with lower baselines has been shown to
improve, that of subjects with higher baselines deteriorates.

For transhumanists, devoted as they are to capacities' maximization,
[this [finding]{.mark}]{.underline} for those with higher baselines
[[should be **concerning**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Devastatingly for them,
[the likely explanation of this **deterioration** is a built-in feature
of the brain: the operation of a "U-shaped curve," whereby [elevating
quantities of **dopamine**]{.mark}, which psychostimulants do,
eventually overtaxes subjects' systems, **[worsen]{.mark}ing
performance**]{.underline}. This curve operates, as well, for oxytocin
and serotonin, which transhumanists tout as "moral enhancers." More
generally, their understandings of oxytocin and serotonin are greatly
oversimplified; for example, scientists increasingly view oxytocin not
as fostering prosociality per se, but as "increasing the salience of
social cues"---prosocial and antisocial alike.

The [[scientific failures of transhumanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
relation to genes and the brain, [[are **striking**]{.mark} **and
interconnected**]{.underline}. For transhumanists' failed proofs of
concept in both arenas have a single source: their conviction that
across the board---whether one's domain of inquiry is computing, genes,
or the brain---units of "information" comprise what's real. Thus, when
transhumanists speak of "cognitive enhancement," they define "cognition"
in terms of facility in the absorption and deployment of
information---the capacity for which is presumed to operate, and thus be
improvable, in a self-contained, or "modular," way. It is this very
notion that the above findings for psychostimulants belie. Similarly,
transhumanists' conviction of genes' dominance and manipulability in
relation to intelligence, kindness, and the like stems from their
position that genes transmit the compartmentalized information that is
these traits' governing cause.

Far from embodying a timeless truth, the [[view that computers and
living things are]{.mark} fundamentally
**[alike]{.mark}**]{.underline}---being, in essence, entities that
transmit and process information---[[is]{.mark} a historical and
[cultural product of World War II]{.mark} and its
aftermath]{.underline}. [Transhumanists' supposedly **cutting-edge**
view of genes reflects early molecular biology, which was quickly
appropriated and applied to living things concepts derived from
computing, information theory, cryptology, and cybernetics]{.underline}.
Biology was coronated an information science---a designation spurring
conviction that, through informational manipulation, human biology could
be upgraded. Molecular biologists' embrace of the informational picture
as literally correct was fostered by their reliance on metaphors---such
as "program," "magnetic tape," "code," and "decipherment"---whose
metaphorical nature was stripped away. [Transhumanists treat this
[increasingly **outdated** vantage point]{.mark} as patently
correct]{.underline}. The same applies to their notion that
"information" will be fully translatable, for their purposes, across the
living-nonliving divide, which is traceable, historically, to a view
expressed by Norbert Wiener, founder of cybernetics, in 1950: "The fact
that we cannot telegraph the pattern of a man from one place to another"
represents a "technical" challenge, not "any impossibility of the idea."
Channeling this perspective, transhumanists embrace projects such as
"whole brain emulation," which, as described by Peter Eckersley and
Anders Sandberg, would involve "taking an individual human's brain,
scanning its entire neural ... structure into a computer, and running an
algorithm to emulate that brain's behavior."

For those committed to human flourishing, [absorbing that [transhumanism
is a scientific **nonstarter**]{.mark} would be a major
**boon**]{.underline}. But a singular focus on information is not
limited to this arena. It increasingly pervades our day-to-day
existences, in terms of how we proceed in our professional and social
lives, as well as when others decide what counts about us (or even who
we "are"), often without our awareness. Prospects for societal
improvement depend, in part, on our becoming more conscious of this
informational frame, especially where it is a mismatch with the
nonlinear and richly contextual nature of what matters most to us as
human beings.

"Even granting the project's assumptions, [it seems obvious that
\[insert species\] have much smaller welfare ranges]{.underline} than
you're suggesting. If the empirical evidence doesn't demonstrate that,
isn't it a problem with the empirical evidence?"

No. First, the [**[empirical ev]{.mark}idence** is our **[only objective
guide]{.mark}** to animals' abilities]{.underline}---avoiding the twin
mistakes of anthropomorphism (attributing human characteristics to
nonhumans) and what Franz de Waal calls "anthropodenial"---i.e., "the a
priori rejection of shared characteristics between humans and animals."
So, we're inclined to defer to it.

This deference, plus the assumption of hedonism, do a lot of work in
explaining our estimates. Given our [[**deference** to]{.mark} the
**empirical [lit]{.mark}erature**, we [aren't positing differences
if]{.mark} we [can't **cite justifications**]{.mark} for
them]{.underline}. Given hedonism, lots of apparent differences between
humans and animals don't matter, as they're irrelevant to the
intensities of the valenced states. So, if our results seem
counterintuitive, it may be that implicit disagreements about these
assumptions explain that reaction.

Second, recall that we're treating missing data as
evidence against sentience and for larger welfare range differences. So,
while the empirical evidence is limited, we aren't using that fact to
stack the deck in animals' favor---quite the opposite.

Third, [[even if]{.mark} the [results are **counterintuitive**]{.mark},
that is **[not]{.mark} necessarily a [reason to reject]{.mark}** the
estimates]{.underline} (as we argue here). After all, [it's an [**open

those [intuitions are **driven by** ]{.mark}**thinking** about the
**[practical implications]{.mark}** of these

to be in place before these estimates have any practical implications at
all. So, if the practical implications are counterintuitive, those other
assumptions are just as much to blame.

The problem with making "efficiencies"

However, [the CCC's advice offers a potential "way out" for factory

The CCC's advice suggests that up to 25% of emissions could be cut using
measures such as feed additives to suppress methane, genetic
modification, and [**slaughtering animals** at an earlier age (the
longer they live, the more emissions they produce]{.underline}).

On paper, the numbers add up. And the advice is clear that we need to
eat less of all types of meat, and reduce the numbers of all types of
livestock. However, [advice on creating \"efficiencies\" could leave the
door open for large agribusinesses to justify expanding intensive
operations and **intensifying farming**, arguing that a more
concentrated, high-yield model reduces emissions per unit of
production.]{.underline}

Harm to animal and human health

The advice overlooks the potential harm to animals, humans and the
environment that these measures could have. \"[Efficiencies\" in
livestock farming are already stretching **animal welfare**
standards]{.underline}. For example, chickens reared in intensive units
have been bred to put on weight very quickly. This kind of breeding
lines the pockets of big business, but does not result in healthy
animals. Operators usually slaughter intensively-reared chickens within
six weeks.

[Agribusinesses often restrict the movement of animals within a
**confined space**, in the name of 'efficiencies' so that poultry and
livestock can fatten up]{.underline} faster -- resulting in a product
that reaches supermarket shelves more quickly. This promises cheap,
abundant meat, but the scale of factory farming comes at an ethical and
environmental cost.

Cramped conditions expose animals to greater risk of infection, meaning
that intensive units routinely apply antibiotics to compensate for poor
hygiene. The Alliance to Save our Antibiotics has drawn attention to how
this over-use is contributing to antibiotic resistance, which is
undermining modern medicine's ability to cure life-threatening
infections in the human population.

Arguments in Defense of Preference Hedonism

In "What Makes a Person's Life Go Best?", Derek Parfit considers three
primary theories for what makes a life good: Preference Hedonism,
Success Theory, and Objective List Theory. Preference Hedonism explains
that [[maximizing]{.mark} the **[happiness]{.mark}** we experience alone
[determine **what is good**]{.mark} for us]{.underline}. While Success
Theory agrees that [we [should **pursue**]{.mark} our own
**[pleasures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it expands the domain to all
desires regardless of whether we actually experience it. Finally,
Objective List Theory assumes that everything is classified into good
and bad, independent of our individual preferences. Of these three, [I
believe **Preference [Hedonism]{.mark}** provides the [most **complete
theory**]{.mark} for **fulfillment**]{.underline}. By primarily
considering arguments on deception from Success Theory and on harmful
desires from Objective List Theory, I will defend Preference Hedonism
and better explore the aspect of this theory.

Before the arguments, I want to fully define these three theories and
highlight important distinctions. Objective List Theory asserts that all
things are unconditionally either good or bad. Naturally, a good life
maximizes the good and minimizes the bad. This theory appeals to our
belief that some things can be good for someone regardless of whether he
or she want it or not. For example, I might push my roommate to study
harder because working hard is inherently good. In that case, his life
would improve, independent of his preferences, because his actions would
better aligned with good ones.

Preference Hedonism, as an extension of Hedonism, [asserts that
[**happiness alone** leads to]{.mark} a **[good
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Preference Hedonism [differs from other
forms of **Hedonism** by [reject]{.mark}ing **[common]{.mark}**, rigid
[definitions of **pleasure**]{.mark} **and pain**]{.underline}.
Torture--a painful experience--might lead to a better life if one
desired it over alternatives, such as divulging the truth.
Unsurprisingly, Preference Hedonism is a preference-dependent theory.
Because happiness exists only within our own heads and never
independently, Preference Hedonism is also psychologically-dependent.

Succinctly, Success Theory extends Preference Hedonism from what we know
to what is by asserting that the fulfillment of our own desires leads to
a good life. A good life doesn't include our belief in our desires, but
the actual outcome of our desires. If John is a Pittsburg Steelers coach
who unfortunately lapsed into a coma during Super Bowl XLIII, his life
still improved. Even though he was not conscious of it, one of his
desires--to have the Steelers win--was satisfied. While Success Theory
agrees with the preference dependence of Preference Hedonism, it differs
by also being dependent on non-psychological factors: most notably, the
objective world.

A relevant difference between Preference Hedonism and Success Theory is
at the limit of what one knows or chooses to know. We make assumptions
about the world because we cannot constantly perceive all events.
Naturally, not all assumptions are correct, including some imperative to
pleasure and pain. Success Theory criticizes Preference Hedonism for its
stance on this sort of ignorance. For example, [I [consider]{.mark} my
[**health** important to]{.mark} my **[happiness]{.mark}**. Thus, I
[might enjoy]{.mark} take [**vitamins** every morning]{.mark} because I
believe it **improves** my health]{.underline}. Someone else notices
that the [vitamins, which [contain cyanide]{.mark}, are
[actually]{.mark} subtly **[deteriorating my health]{.mark}** until I
spontaneously **die**. From his or her perspective, I [would not have
led a **good life**]{.mark} because I was actually **unhealthy**,
[yet]{.mark} Preference **[Hedonism]{.mark}** would [suggest]{.mark}
that [I **did**]{.mark} have a **good life**]{.underline} because I was
happy.

One could summarize the Preference Hedonism response as "What you don't
know can't hurt you." Just as I can't absolutely know the actual effect
of the vitamins, the beliefs I gain satisfaction from could constantly
change, even though from my perspective, my life hasn't changed. For
example, I desire for my friends to be safe. While I'm writing this
paper, however, my friend Ben could have been hit by a car. Anticipating
the argument from Success Theory that Ben's safety isn't related to me,
I argue that "related" is too ambiguously defined to be definitive.
Regardless, my happiness certainly hasn't changed because of what might
or might not happened to Ben. For completeness, we can even consider the
opinion of another friend, RJ, who both knows about Ben's tragic
encounters and my ignorance. He could choose never to tell me about Ben
because I would have a better life not knowing and worrying about that
past event. Everyday, people use these white lies and omissions to
protect others under the assumption that one's life is better if he or
she is happier.

A deeper issue from Success Theory is deliberate self-deception or
ignorance. Accepting that we cannot know everything, Preference Hedonism
still places psychological states above the objective world. Because
Preference Hedonism only cares about discernable psychological states,
the validity of our beliefs is irrelevant. It therefore equates the
happiness of self-deception with that of actually changing reality. The
lack of distinction conflicts with our typical morality, which suggests
that a good life should be based on generally true beliefs. For example,
imagine Bob's wife is cheating on him behind his back, and one of Bob's
desires is to have a faithful wife. By Success Theory, his life is worse
because one of his desires is not satisfied in the real world. By
Preference Hedonism, his life is equally as good as if she wasn't
cheating because he doesn't know to be unhappy. If he were to find out,
he could attempt to rectify the situation. If we are considering
psychological states, however, he could instead change his memories.

First, imagine Bob changes his memories so that he forgets that his wife
is cheating on him. Compare two parallel worlds: in one, Bob never
realizes his wife is cheating on him, and in another, he finds out, then
subsequently forces himself to think he has ended his wife's actions. By
Preference Hedonism, he makes the same choices and experiences the same
pleasures and pains before and after his self-deception, making his life
equally good in both. By Success Theory, these two lives are largely
equal because Bob's life hasn't worsened by simply learning something
that is already true. The focus of the criticism is then the choice to
go through self-deception, and whether that is acceptable in a good life
under either theory. If we continue with this example, Bob has two
choices if he doesn't actively improve the situation. One, he neither
pursues any method of self-deception nor changes his wife's behavior.
His life has worsened for knowing that his wife is cheating on him. Two,
he can have a mind wipe, where he thinks his life is no worse. In both
of these cases, an unaware observer would agree with these evaluations
if only by outward signs from Bob.

The logical follow-up to this argument is to compare the two situations
where Bob tries to change his wife's behavior, and the other where Bob
alters his memories to believe he has changed his wife's behavior.
Ignoring the moral quality of the mind alteration, the future
ramifications of dishonesty, confusion, or further harm still make mind
alteration less preferable, even by a Preference Hedonist. Thus, these
two situations still aren't equivalent, as a Success Theorist might
suggest that a Preference Hedonist believes. If we were to assume,
however, that there were no further interactions that ever caused the
warped memories to matter again, then we can accept these as effectively
equivalent. From pure Preference Hedonism, we must accept that altered
memories are no better or worse than an altered reality. Notably,
however, I don't believe that Success Theory offers a better evaluation
in this case. While this might not be a standard Preference Hedonistic
perspective because it perfectly summative, I accept that these two
situations are trivially different and that Success Theory, even in this
case, cannot improve upon this evaluation.

As an analogy, consider a single football game, where the Cardinals are
losing to the Steelers. Assume that the Cardinals' ultimate desire is to
win, just as a person's ultimate desire is to live a good life. Within
that desire, the Cardinals also desire to gain yards because yards
contribute to winning. On the final drive at the end of the game, the
Cardinals make a pass that, even if completed, would have them lose.
Intuitively, we would say that it doesn't matter if they had completed
the pass or not, a fair judgment of an isolated desire. Because the game
is ends after the pass, the completion of that pass couldn't possibly
affect any other desires within the game (including victory), and
therefore doesn't noticeably make the game any better or worse for the
Cardinals. Compare to Bob's final situation where altered memories never
affect his life otherwise. In this most extreme example, even when we
accept Success Theory with deception-avoidance as a desire, the two
alternative situations are trivially different. Completely isolated
pleasures, pains, or desires ultimately contribute minimally to the
quality of life, perhaps because of the subtly fecundity of all
interactions. Even as Preference Hedonism seems to struggle with
aligning deception within what makes a life good, Success Theory doesn't
effectively offer a better explanation.

Moving onto objections from another perspective, Objective List Theory
would first note that Preference Hedonism is an inherently unfair system
and doesn't establish a consistent moral code. If everything depends on
individual preferences, then we truly have no standard for behavior. One
can justify any action as long as it improves self-happiness. A correct
theory for what is good should expand and apply to both individuals and
the groups they create. We hope that our governments are ethical, but a
government based upon Preference Hedonism could never make absolute
laws. For example, most governments have laws against stealing. If
stealing were to fulfill one's desire, then that should be allowed
within the law.

Most Preference Hedonists would likely agree that stealing is generally
wrong. They could also extend it to say that it not good specifically
for the stealer to steal. Even with laws, typical mob mentality has led
to lynching, so the potential pain to an individual is great. Stealing
threatens the happiness of others, and they will act in their own best
interests to eliminate the potential loss. By and large, violations of
conventional morality would tend to lead to greater long-term pain than
short-term happiness. The real issue that leads to crime, then, is
short-sightedness. Thus, government intervenes by enforcing rules of
thumb (similar to Mill's interpretation) to decrease immediate happiness
for an ultimately harmful action. For efficiency, a just Preference
Hedonistic government could make absolute laws to discourage generally
bad behavior.

Self-destructive behavior seems to also fit better with Objective List
Theory than Preference Hedonism. Imagine Bill locks himself in a room
and lives in misery. By conventional morality, we would say that he does
not lead a good life, with which Objective List Theory can immediately
agree by placing Bill's actions on the bad list. This construction of a
counter-example is fairly simple for a Preference Hedonist to defeat:
Bill simply doesn't know about greater pleasures. If he had been
sheltered and never known the value of love, then that existence is the
best choice available. An Objective List Theorist could extend the
counter-example by assuming that Bill knew the full extent of pleasures
and pains that existed in an idealized manner. While perhaps initially
fanciful, this notion carries in even less idealized situations. Many
turn to drugs or illegal behavior, which we would typically see as
self-destructive and bad for one's life, when fully knowledgeable of the
alternatives.

Given that the argument from Objective List Theorists holds in
non-idealized worlds, a Preference Hedonist must simply concede that an
apparently bad existence is the one that leads to the most happiness. If
Bill truly preferred an existence that everyone else finds repugnant,
perhaps his aggregate happiness totals to less than the average, yet is
still the best out of his alternatives. By premise, Bill would dislike
being forced into a marriage or love than his previous life. On the
basis of pleasure, this reversal is no different than putting a normal,
innocent man into prison. By any of these theories, this is wrong, and
on preference, this is the same as Bill's situation.

While the examples used seem somewhat outrageous, the distinctions
between these are necessarily bizarre. In conventional usage, these
theories largely propose similar intuitions and goals, and thus, we can
assess the validity of them by considering extremes. Preference
Hedonism's defense of some principles is somewhat tenuous, particularly
with respect to self-deception, yet across objections to all of three of
these theories, I find [Preference **Hedonism** [most **consistent** in
**maximal coverage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It is only in unusual occasions that I find myself as compatible with a
label. Back in my wild and reckless youth, I have probably encountered
only those memes as acceptably labelling me:
[**[Transhumanist]{.mark}**, Polyamorist, **[Immortalist]{.mark}**,
Extrovert]{.underline}.

That was it. No political position, no sexual orientation, no teen
affiliation, no ethnicity, no nationality, no soccer team, no dress
code. No religion.

There are very few one-word things that I feel like I am.

Then along came Utilitarianism. We were presented by transhumanism, and
got along somewhat well, I would check out its origins, who was into it
as a philosophy, and we seemed to be thinking in the same general
direction.

Once we had some problems with regards to vehicles. We call those the
trolley problems.

From then on I slowly met many transhumanists (keep in mind that I live
in Brazil), and in general would identify instantaneously. That did not
happen with utilitarians. There was something to utilitarianism that
just didn\'t work for me.

Yesterday, I finally had the sudden realization. It was negative
utilitarianism. Everyone these days is a negative utilitarian. They may
have come from many realms into utilitarianism (preference or
hedonistic, doesn\'t matter) but eventually they notice that suffering
is really really bad and start to think that they ought to do something
about it. Some set course towards diminishing it, and I wish them
Godspeed. Yet I could not acquiesce in their beliefs, rejoice in their
conquests, celebrate their pursuals.

It is arguable, and has been extensively argued, that negative
utilitarianism may be a more ethical approach, during our non posthuman
times, than it\'s positive counterpart. This is correct.

Enters Santayana, \"Knowledge of what is possible is the beginning of
happiness.\"

and also one of few philosophical agreements of the millennia "Ought
implies can"

I don\'t feel good thinking about suffering. [[I don\'t **like
suffering**]{.underline}]{.mark}, I don\'t spontaneously wake up every
morning and visit a hospital. I never try to check out what is going on
in the nearest slum to see if someone died, and in fact, I don\'t even
read the newspaper, which strikes me as a lot of ephemeral sad
information about the things that went so wrong the last fews days that
people are willing to read about it. I bet you like horror/suspense
movies, I don\'t.

It doesn\'t really matter if you are talking about diminishing
suffering, relieving pain, decreasing poverty or striking misery. When I
read sentences like the previous one, I read " It doesn\'t really matter
if you are talking about diminishing suffering, relieving pain,
decreasing poverty or striking misery." My brain just doesn\'t get
around this and I don\'t want it to.

So I finally made peace with it, and would like to go out of the closet
now:

[Folks, I am a **[Positive Utilitarian]{.mark}**]{.underline}!

For the past several years I have understood evolutionary psychology,
cognitive neuroscience, and read 7 books on happiness because I really
care about making other people happy. I\'ve been promoting happiness
ever since school time and, like the NY less wrong group, I\'ve
optimized for fun around me as much as I could (some day I\'ll write a
post about effective group-happiness increasing techniques, but this is
not that day). [What attracted me to **[transhumanism]{.mark}** was not
how it would **cure disease**, solve **starvation**, but it\'s motto:
**[Better than well]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One of the things that
caused most shock in my self presentations to the people of the
Singularity institute was when I said: I am more of a transhumanist then
a singularitarian. Now I know what that meant, it meant that I don\'t
have a barrier against thinking about "better than well" but I do have a
barrier against "before someone does it and destroys life as we know
it". This of course, sums up perfectly with the fact that I have
rejected joining the X-risk network launched here in Less Wrong

Positive Utilitarianism is not a position I am arguing for within
Utilitarianism, please don\'t abandon the children suffering. But I
would like to argue that it is OK in the broad picture of things. [It is
[**much better** than]{.mark} the vast [majority of **ethical choices**

is about **maximizing**]{.mark} the **[happiness]{.mark}** of

make that everyone\'s preferences.

### 2AC\-\--Yes Extinction

#### A single nuclear deployment is [existential]{.underline}.

Sarah **Weiler** 11-16-20**22**, PhD candidate at the University of
Strathclyde studying the epistemology of foreign policymaking. "A case
against focusing on tail-end nuclear war risks"
https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K7aA9YXRoRQvqjXuq/a-case-against-focusing-on-tail-end-nuclear-war-risks
e //MDC

Spelling out the argument

The main thrust of my argument is that I contest the
viability/feasibility of present-day attempts to either prevent
cascading consequences of the one-time deployment of nuclear weapons or
to prepare for those consequences. Because of this, I argue that it is
dangerously overconfident to focus on those two outcomes (preventing the
worst case; preparing for the world after) while deprioritizing the goal
of preventing any kind of nuclear war. I point to the unpredictable
consequences of a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons, and to the
potentially far-reaching damage/risk they may bring, to assert that
\"small-scale\" nuclear conflict does matter from a longtermist
perspective (as well as from many other ethical perspectives).

Below, I spell out my argument by breaking it up into three separate
reasons, which together motivate my conclusion regarding which
high-level outcome to prioritize in the nuclear risk reduction space.

Reason 1: [The possible consequences of a **one-time deployment** of
nuclear weapons are potentially catastrophic]{.underline}

While I would argue that [the sheer destruction wrought by the
detonation of a single nuclear weapon is sufficient grounds for caring
about the risk and for making the choice to attempt to reduce
it]{.underline}\[5\], I understand and accept that [this is less obvious
when taking on a scope sensitive moral perspective (such as total
utilitarianism), which recognizes/assumes that there are many incredibly
important problems and risks in the world, that we cannot fix all of
them at once, and that this obliges us to prioritize based on just how
large the risk posed by each problem is]{.underline} (and on how good
our chances to reduce it are). I will here make the case that [the
consequences of a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons are large
enough in expectation to warrant the attention of a cause prioritizing
**consequentialist**, especially if that consequentialist accepts the
ethical argument of longtermism. I assume that such a (longtermist)
consequentialist considers a problem sufficiently important if it
contributes significantly to existential risks\[6\].]{.underline}

There are several plausible ways in which a [one-time use of nuclear
weapons can precipitate existential risk]{.underline}:

Escalation / Failure at containing nuclear war\[7\]

A relatively [immediate consequence of a first deployment of nuclear
weapons, or of a \"small-scale\" nuclear conflict, is that it can
**escalate** into a larger exchange of attacks, with no obvious or
foolproof stopping point.]{.underline}

The first deployment of [nuclear weapons can also lead to large-scale
nuclear war more indirectly, by **setting a precedent**, weakening
strong normative anti-use inhibitions among decision-makers, and thus
making the use of these weapons in future conflicts more
likely]{.underline}.

In either case, [a first deployment of nuclear weapons would then be a
significant causal factor for larger-scale deployment, as such
contributing to the risk of **nuclear winter** (which in itself has some
chance of constituting an existential catastrophe]{.underline}\[8\]).

Civilizational collapse

The [one-time deployment of nuclear weapons could severely upset norms
against violence in the global system]{.underline} (and/or in specific
localities).

It could thus be a significant causal factor in increasing the incidence
and severity of violent conflict globally.

In a worst case scenario, [such conflict could occur at a scale that
induces **civilizational collapse** even if no further nuclear weapons
are deployed]{.underline}.

Societal vulnerability

The [one-time deployment of nuclear weapons would plausibly lead to
political, economic, social, and cultural/normative shocks that could
cause turmoil, instability, and a breakdown/weakening of societies\'
abilities to deal with, prepare for, and respond to pressing and
longterm challenges (such as run-away **climate change**, the
development and control of **dangerous technologies**,
etc).]{.underline}

One more specific example/scenario of these effects would be\[9\]: The
one-time [deployment of nuclear weapons makes people more suspicious and
distrusting of other countries and of efforts for bi- and multilateral
cooperation, thus exacerbating **great power conflict**, fueling
technological **arms race** dynamics, decreasing the chance that
revolutionary tech like **AGI**/TAI is developed safely, and increasing
the chance of destructive conflict over the appropriation and use of
such tech]{.underline}.

Reason 2: It seems virtually impossible to put a likelihood on any of
these consequences, or on the chance that interventions taken today to
prevent or prepare for them succeed

How would a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons today influence state
leaders\' decisions to acquire, modernize, and use nuclear weapons in
the future? Would it lead to an immediate retaliation and escalation, or
would there be restraint? Would the vivid demonstration of these
weapons\' destructive power reinforce emotions, norms, and reasons that
deter from their use in war, or would the precedent break a taboo that
has hencetoforth prevented the intentional deployment of nuclear
weapons? How would such an event impact deterrence dynamics (incl. the
credibility of retaliatory threats, a trust in each party\'s rational
choice to avoid MAD, etc)? How would it impact proliferation aspirations
by current non-nuclear weapons states?

How would a deployment of nuclear weapons influence the current global
order, the relations and interactions between nation-states and
non-state actors, and the global economy? How would it affect cultural
norms and values, as well as social movements and civil society across
the world? How would all this impact on efforts to tackle global
challenges and risks? How would it impact the global as well as several
regional communities\' resilience and ability to respond to crises?

I consider these questions impossible to answer with any degree of
certainty. Why? Because [we have close to no relevant empirical data to
infer the probability of different consequences of a one-time nuclear
deployment, nor can these probabilities be derived logically from some
reliable higher-order principles/theories]{.underline}.

Statements about the causal effects of interventions face similarly
severe challenges: Even if we were able to make a decent guess at what
the world after a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons would look
like, I don\'t think [we have much data or understanding to inform
decisions meant to prepare for such a world. In addition, such
preparatory or preventive interventions can\'t be assessed while or
after they are implemented, since there is no feedback that would give
us a sense of how effective the interventions are]{.underline}.\[10\]

Reason 3: De-emphasizing the goal of preventing any nuclear war
plausibly has adverse effects

I\'m thinking about two channels through which a focus on the tail-ends
of nuclear war risk can have the adverse effect of making the deployment
of nuclear weapons more likely: opportunity costs, and a weakening of
the normative taboo against nuclear weapons employment. In an expansion
of the latter point, I\'m also concerned about the more general
desensitizing effect that such a focus can bring.

Opportunity costs

The first channel is probably obvious and doesn\'t require much
additional explanation. If resources (time, political capital, money)
are spent narrowly on preventing or preparing for the worst-case outcome
of a nuclear conflict, those same resources cannot be spent on reducing
the probability of nuclear war per se\[11\]. Given that the resources to
address nuclear risks are seriously limited in our present world
(especially after the decision by one of the biggest funders in this
space, the MacArthur Foundation, to phase out its support by the end of
2023; see Kimball 2021), such diversion of available means would
arguably be quite significant and could seriously impact our overall
efforts to prevent nuclear war.

Weakening of the nuclear taboo

The second channel is a little less direct and requires acceptance of a
few assumptions:

First, that \"nuclear war is being and has been averted at least in part
by norms that discourage leaders of nuclear weapons states from making
(or from seriously contemplating) the decision to use nuclear weapons
against \'enemy\' targets, \[\...\] either \[because\] decision-makers
feel normative pressure from domestic and/or global public opinion, or
\[because\] they have internalized these norms themselves, or
both.\"\[12\]

Second, that these norms are affected by the way in which authoritative
voices talk about nuclear weapons, and that they are weakened when
authoritative voices start to use diminutive language to describe some
forms of nuclear war (describing them as minor, small-scale, or limited)
as well as when they rank different types of nuclear war and downplay
the danger of some types by contrasting their expected cost with the
catastrophic consequences of the worst-case outcomes.\[13\]

Third, that the discourse of the policy research community is an
authoritative voice in this space\[14\], and

fourth, that effective altruists and effective altruist organizations
can contribute to and shape this authoritative discourse.

What follows from these assumptions is that research that makes the case
for prioritizing worst-case outcomes (by \"demonstrating\" how working
on them is orders of magnitude more important than working on \"smaller
nuclear war issues\") could have the unintended negative side effect of
increasing the probability of a nuclear first strike, because such
research could weaken normative barriers to the deployment of nuclear
weapons.

Desensitizing effect

In addition to the concern that focusing on worst case outcomes can end
up increasing nuclear war risk (by increasing the probability of weapons
deployment), I am worried that such a focus, and the language
surrounding it, has a morally desensitizing effect. I feel a stark sense
of unease (or, at times, terror) when I hear people talk nonchalantly
about "unimportant small-scale nuclear war" or, to name a more specific
example, "the likely irrelevance of India-Pakistan war scenarios", when
I read long articles that calculate the probability for different death
counts in the event of nuclear escalation with the explicit intention of
figuring out whether this is a risk worthy of our attention, or when I
listen in on discussions about which conditions would make the
deployment of nuclear weapons a "rational choice". These experiences set
off bright warning lights before my inner eye, and I feel strongly
compelled to speak out against the use and promulgation of the types of
arguments and reasoning just listed.

Maybe the reason for this intuitive response is that I've been taught -
mostly implicitly, through the culture and art I encountered while
growing up in a progressive, educated slice of Austrian society - that
[it is this kind of careless, trivializing language, and a collective
failure to stand up and speak out against it, that have preceded and (at
least partially) enabled the worst kinds of mass atrocity in
history]{.underline}? I don't have full clarity on my own views here; I
find myself unable to pin down what I believe the size and probability
of the problem (the desensitizing effect of this type of speech) to be;
nor can I meticulously trace where my worry comes from and which
sources, arguments, and evidence it is informed by. For the last months
(all throughout and after the summer fellowship), I've been trying to
get a better understanding of what I think and to mold my opposition
into a watertight or at least comprehensible argument, and I largely
failed. And yet - I continue to believe fairly strongly that there is
harm and danger in the attitudes and conversations I witnessed. I'm not
asking anyone to defer to that intuitive belief, of course; what I ask
you to do is to reflect on the feelings I describe, and I'd also
encourage you to not be instantly dismissive if you share similar
concerns without being able to back them up with a rational argument.

But even if you think the last paragraph betrays some failing of my
commitment to rational argument and reason, I hope that it doesn't
invalidate the entire post for you. Though I personally assign
substantial weight to the costs (and risks) of "moral numbing", I think
that the overall case I make in this essay remains standing if you
entirely discard the part about "desensitizing effects".

Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown that [the assumptions underlying the claim
that suffering dominates in nature are not always justified, and thus
that it is at least as plausible that **pleasure
dominates**]{.underline}. However, as we have emphasised, t[his is a
matter that requires **empirical data** to determine the extent of wild
animal suffering. Like Soryl et al. we consider it an "open question
whether the life of a wild animal is worth living" (2021, p. 11); though
we are more optimistic about the answer than they appear to
be]{.underline}. We do not doubt that other researchers in this area
would all agree that more research is needed to properly answer
questions about wild animal welfare. Where we differ is in our prior
expectations of the likelihood of a finding of a net-positive or
net-negative welfare balance for wild animals. For instance, Horta
(2010) takes it to be the case that we can make "informed guesses" about
the lives of wild animals, that can be "well-grounded in our knowledge
of relevant facts about what happens to them in their lives" (p. 76). We
agree, but as we hope to have shown in this paper, it is important to
keep in mind all relevant facts, particularly including investigating
and counting positive welfare states alongside the negative ones so
commonly discussed. This mirrors a shift in focus within animal welfare
science more generally - where it was originally almost exclusively
concerned with reductions of suffering, there is now also a focus on
creating positive experiences for other animals (Yeates and Main 2008).

[There are biological reasons weighing both for and against a model of
predominant suffering in nature, and without further data, we end up
**merely trading intuitions**]{.underline}. While no-one denies that
there are many sources of suffering for wild animals, [there are also
many sources of pleasure, and we cannot from the outside try to weigh
these against one another. There are many reasons why our intuitions may
be faulty -- we may fail to empathise with the exact experiences of wild
animals or we may only think about small sub-sets of existing
animals]{.underline} (with a bias toward the more visible larger
vertebrate animals) (Horta 2010; Tomasik 2015).

Which types of experience an animal has, their intensities, and their
durations, will all be important sources of information to consider, and
ones for which we currently lack most of the important data. Most
importantly, we need to know how the animal itself weights the different
experiences -- which negative experiences are worst, and to what degree
different positive experiences may balance them out. There are a num ber
of methods that we may use to assess the welfare of wild animals (e.g.
Harvey et al. 2020), and in a future paper we will take a closer look at
some specific methods that may be suitable for these ends. Which methods
will work best will depend on the context of measurement, and the types
of answers we are looking for. However, what is important is to
establish how the different experiences of an animal's life interact and
trade off to form a total welfare experience, and whether this will be
overall positive or negative. [Importantly, more data is urgently needed
to settle the matter and allow us to move forwards with planning
effective strategies for assistance where required. We should not assume
too much before we know more. It is thus important that animal welfare
science expand its scope to include all sentient animals - whether in
captivity or in the wild - and of particular importance that the science
of wild animal welfare encompasses investigation of positive welfare
states alongside possible sources of suffering]{.underline}. Only then
will we be able to accurately judge whether, when, and how we might
intervene to improve wild animal lives.

6\. Conclusions

We hope to have demonstrated in this paper that [animal--computer
interaction (ACI) bears great potential to improve the welfare of
animals by enhancing their agency as well as to offer us opportunities
to learn about their cognitive abilities]{.underline}. We have discussed
three of what we consider the most promising pathways.

[First, ACI can provide animals with **control over their environments**
as well as the opportunity to engage in more choices]{.underline}.
Typically, [animals in captivity have limited control over their
environments, which can cause frustration and boredom, compared to the
environments of wild animals]{.underline}. Here, [ACI could even go
beyond these environments by giving animals the opportunity to engage in
more choices and have more control than is possible for their wild
counterparts]{.underline}. Further, as caregivers necessarily spend only
limited time with their animals, ACI can provide animals with
round-the-clock enrichment opportunities they would otherwise lack.

Second, [we have discussed the benefits of ACI in enhancing animals'
**social agency**. Although use of such technology might seem solitary
at first, it has already been applied in several contexts to enable
communication between animals across different sites as well as
communication between animals and their caregivers]{.underline}.

Finally, we discussed [the possibility of computer games for animals as
a form of **cognitive stimulation**. What may initially sound absurd has
in fact already been a wide success. Many of the computerised tasks
developed to probe the cognitive abilities of other animals can already
be considered as legitimate games, such as whack-a-mole or matching
games]{.underline}. These games can provide animals with an opportunity
to exercise their agency and cognitive control to improve their welfare
and develop competence to face future challenges, among other benefits
such as the potential for physical exercise.

[While there are potential problems and limitations to ACI, we have
argued that many of these have been **exaggerated and can be
overcome**]{.underline}. Particularly for novel applications in zoos,
farms, and companion animals, paying attention to the longer history of
ACI in laboratory research (e.g., through use of computer game tasks)
could help solve problems of design and implementation. For a technology
that is still in its infancy, [there is much promise here to improve
animal welfare by allowing animals to exercise their agency across a
range of domains. Ongoing research and development in ACI should bear
this in mind, maintaining a focus on centering the animals as agents and
how they can benefit from using the technology]{.underline}.

Without Blood: The Public Health Benefits of Lab‐Grown Meat"

Disgust

Despite the obvious benefits of clean meat, many people find the idea of
eating cultivated meat disgusting. This is important to the future of
clean meat because disgust has a big influence on what we con sume. The
main reason disgust seems to have evolved is that it helps us to
distinguish and avoid foods that are unsafe to eat, what Rozin calls
"the omnivore's dilemma" (1976). The idea is that humans are unique in
constantly seeking out new forms of food, some of which is bound to be
pathogenic, even deadly. Meat is more likely to contain harmful
pathogens than plants, meat is responsible for more foodborne illnesses
than plants, and societies have far more food taboos with regard to meat
than other foods (Fessler and Nav arrete, 2003). Moreover, some of these
taboos are beneficial.

Some food-based taboos and aversions are based in our evolved biology:
they are built into us (Curtis, et al. 2011). For example, the smell of
rotting car casses makes us turn away in disgust, while it attracts
vultures to a fresh kill. This makes perfect sense since our stomachs
are poorly adapted to digest the kinds of pathogens that vultures can
contend with. [But even our **biological predispositions can be
altered**, especially when they are directed by social norms that shape
our behaviour more substantially than smell and sight]{.underline}.

As Joseph Henrich has argued, [social norms can embody a kind of
implicit cultural knowledge acquired through trial and
error]{.underline} (2015). To take an especially interesting example,
when the Spanish conquistadors came to the Americas, they quickly took
up the habit of eating corn, like the Mayans they conquered. According
to Henrich, native Americans had learned to soak corn with a mixture of
burnt shells, or ashes from fire, before cooking and eating it. This
apparently allowed the corn to release essential vitamins. When
Spaniards decided to skip the seemingly strange process and go straight
to eating the corn, they developed sometimes deadly vitamin
deficiencies. This illustrates how our willingness to eat new foods can
be beneficial but sometimes only if it's paired with social taboos
against certain practices---in this case, against eating corn without
going through the proper rituals. From an evolutionary standpoint,
disgust toward novel foods makes sense, as does a disposition to eat
novel foods only after per forming the right rituals or following the
predominant social norms.

[Food preferences form and crystallize at an early age and mostly
reflect the foods we are exposed to]{.underline} (Birch 1999). Most
importantly for clean meat, food neophobia---the aversion to unfamiliar
foods---is greater for animal-based foods than plant-based foods (Çınar,
Karinen, and Tybur 2021). This almost certainly reflects the fact that
many of humanity's deadliest pathogens have come from eating animals
rather than plants (Greger 2007). Thus, it is not surprising that more
familiar conventional meat production is generally considered more
palatable and less disgusting to the average person than the
alternative, since no one grew up with this kind of food (Siegrist and
Hartmann 2020). It is likely that [this consideration was part of the
**branding of cultured meat as "clean meat**" rather than "lab meat" or
"in vitro meat," which it is sometimes called.]{.underline}

[A few studies have investigated consumer accep ance of clean meat. In
one survey of American adults, **65 per cent were willing to try clean
meat** and about one-third said they would be willing to eat clean meat
as a replacement for farmed meat]{.underline} (Wilks and Phillips 2017).
[Men, who tend to eat more meat than women, also had a more positive
view of clean meat in this American sample]{.underline}. In a sample of
over three thousand participants from the United States, India, and
China, [93 per cent of Chinese participants said they were likely to
purchase clean meat, as were 86 per cent of Indian participants and 75
per cent of American participants]{.underline} (Bryant and Barnett
2020). In keeping with ideas about sex differences and food aversions,
[men and those who are less disgust-sensitive are more favourable
towards clean meat]{.underline} (Bryant and Barnett 2020).

If clean meat is going to become an important solution to the many
problems caused by the global animal industry we must consider how to
address the prudential problems of disgust. One of the main obstacles to
producing clean meat is managing contamination, since the animal cells
that comprise clean meat do not have a functioning immune system. Any
contamination of clean meat on the market or a recall could have
long-term effects on attitudes to clean meat. This could mean that
people will continue to buy more familiar meat, for example from CAFOs,
for decades, unless we can maintain high sanitation standards for
synthetic meat.

People are often more concerned with what's delicious than what is
virtuous (Bryant and Barnett 2018). That's why making sure that clean
meat is both safer and tastier than conventional meat can go a long way
to inducing ordinary people to want to eat it. Still, we think that [the
rise of zoonotic diseases associated with conventional meat production
can turn the tide of disgust against forms of animal agriculture that
can cause pandemics, and **make clean meat more psychologically
palatable**]{.underline}. Future [marketing campaigns may even be able
to make use of video material of the disgusting features of large-scale
industrial animal farming, which is not at all appetizing to most
people, and compare it to the clean and futuristic looking synthetic
meat lab]{.underline}s cropping up in places like Holland and Israel.
That is, by highlighting disgusting features of farmed meat, we may be
able to reduce the visceral revulsion some may have toward synthetic
meat. Part of our efforts must be directed against an anti-scientific
attitude toward "artificial" foods. "Natural" does not automatically
mean good, and highlighting how cruel large-scale industrial farming is
toward animals, along with the public health risks it poses to people,
may help to reduce the stigma against clean meat.

5 Conclusions

Reflection on our moral responsibility to future generations has become
increasingly relevant in recent years because of the worsening
environmental crisis and its consequences for ur descendants' quality of
life. We are increasingly aware that it is necessary to promote
responsible environmental policies, based on eco-friendly practices and
technologies, and to raise awareness of the importance of natural
resources and responsible consumption. However, [when we consider the
future, we realize that the problem not only involves worsening living
conditions, but extends to the threat of human extinction itself. The
possibility of our annihilation draws attention to two crucial issues:
the value of humanity's survival and our responsibility to prevent a
catastrophe of this magnitude]{.underline}. We have seen that a Humean
conception of sentimentalist morality is capable of explaining why it
would be immoral to disregard the extinction of the human species. [To
inflict suffering on future generations or, in any case, to completely
ignore the risk of our extinction is, according to a Humean perspective,
a morally objectionable (i.e., immoral) attitude, because it would show
a complete lack of sensitivity (or sympathetic participation) towards
those who will be born in the future or who may, in any case, come into
the world]{.underline}. After all, an eventual extinction would affect
not only the people who might be born, but also those who will in the
future surely live and go through this process. Of course, extinction
could also be a sudden, unpredictable event (caused, for example, by the
fall of an asteroid or the very rapid spread of a lethal pandemic), but
[it is easier (and more reasonable) to imagine that it could be the
result of a long process characterized by a progressive, as well as
irreversible, deterioration in living conditions. Indeed, in this
scenario, future generations may be condemned to living a **life of
suffering and deprivation** with the knowledge that their future is
sealed and that that of subsequent generations will be even more adverse
and that human extinction may now be inevitable]{.underline}. The
generations experiencing this transition may even enjoy greater
availability of natural resources and goods than we do. Despite this,
though, [their quality of life may paradoxically be lower or much worse
than ours. In fact, despite having access to greater material wealth,
they may experience a lack of meaning and find it difficult to find
(some) meaning in their own existence]{.underline}.

### 1AR\-\--Extinction Bad

#### Human extinction has negative effects for animals too.

Maurizio **Balistreri** 1-27-20**24**, Maurizio Balistreri currently
works at the Department of Philosophy and Educational Sciences,
University of Turin. Maurizio does research in Bioethics, Robethics and
Ethics. *Topoi* p. 55-63, "Ethics of Extinction: Humean Sentimentalism
and the Value of the Human Species" //MDC

According to the Humean conception of morality, though, any moral
assessment of the extinction of the human species should not only
consider the interests of future human generations, but also its
possible or foreseeable consequences for other living, sentient beings.
Indeed, unlike other conceptions of morality, the conception of
sentimentalist ethics does not draw an ontological, moral distance
between humans and other sentient beings (Beauchamp 1999; Baier 1993).
That is, even non-human animals deserve moral consideration, as they may
suffer or be positively or negatively affected by our choices, and a
morally scrupulous person will be sensitive to their welfare too
(Chicken 2016). It is true that a dog, cat, pig or cow does not belong
to the 'human' species, but this is irrelevant from a moral point of
view, as what is important is their sensitivity and the fact that we can
inflict pain or suffering on them or increase their pleasure and
happiness (Gruen 2015). Humean ethics can, therefore, be sensitive to
the arguments advanced by those advocating the extinction of the human
species as the most morally responsible, altruistic choice towards other
living things. However, while those in favor of extinction claim that
humankind is a cancer, [those who advocate a Humean conception of
morality can also consider the benefits (or advantages) that non-human
animals themselves derive (or might in the future derive) from the
presence of the human species. Humans can provide animals with not only
with care and protection, but also a more **controlled, protected
environment** (including from possible violence by other animals) that
can promote their well-being and enable them to achieve a higher or
better quality of life (Nussbaum 2006). Such **benefits may not be
achievable** (or preserved) in a world without human
presence]{.underline} (Nussbaum 2023). Moreover, in addition to helping
provide animals with greater justice, humans can also improve their
physical, intellectual capacities (Chan 2009, 2021). [Through, for
example, interaction with humans and training, animals can learn complex
tasks, **develop cognitive skills** and improve their ability to
communicate]{.underline}. Looking forward, then, genome editing
technologies could be used on animals for not only therapeutic, but also
enhancement purposes (Bovenkerk and Kramer 2022). [Interventions such as
these, along with more traditional ones, could offer non-human animals
new perspectives and opportunities for growth, expanding their 'natural'
capabilities and enriching their lives. In these terms, from a Humean
view, the extinction of the human species could have negative
consequences not only on humans who could be born and have a good life,
but also on sentient animals]{.underline}.

5\. The Need for Measurement

It is clear that [there is **not a direct link** between freedom and
captivity---zoos and wild environments can provide a variety of freedoms
while limiting others. This will, in turn, affect the impact of freedom,
or its lack, on animal welfare.]{.underline} We need some way of
assessing the relative welfare importance of different gains and losses
to freedom in order to determine the value of freedom and the ways in
which captivity may provide benefits and harms. [It is here that we need
to step away from theoretical debates or trading of intuitions and
**gather real data** to settle these questions. Too often, charges and
replies take place with only our own intuitions as a guide as to what is
good or bad about freedom or captivity]{.underline}. Membership of
[animal protection groups has been found to link with strong biophilia
(affinity for animals), the propensity to attribute intentions and
mental states to animals, and **lower understanding of the biological
reality**, in terms of current scientific knowledge about animals
\[100\]. Essentialist teleological views about animal welfare are
**rarely grounded in any scientific knowledge** we have gained about
these an]{.underline}imals \[101\].

[Thus, while these advocates care deeply and are trying their best to
help animals in what they think are important ways, they may often be
missing the mark in terms of what is really important to
animals]{.underline}. Freedom and welfare are complex phenomena that
need to be addressed with research if we want real answers about what is
actually good for animals. One of the biggest problems in applied animal
ethics is the conducting of [discussions such as these on purely
hypothetical and intuition-driven terrain, frequently centred with
anthropomorphism and without reference to real data about the lives of
animals]{.underline}. [We can talk back-and-forth ad infinitum about
whether or not we think animals do better or worse in or outside of
captive environments, but at the end of the day; **this is all
guesswork**]{.underline}. [We can talk about the importance of access to
particular resources, or performance of particular behaviours, or even
of the experience of freedom itself, but without properly collected
data, there will always be room for **doubt and
counterargument**]{.underline}. Contra Terry Maple, who argued that
"whether wild animals experience greater wellbeing than captive animals
is a subject of debate that will always be susceptible to the imposition
of human values" \[102\] (p. 225), we think that there is a range of
empirical tools available to help make progress. Discussion of the range
of methods available is beyond the scope of this paper, but in a
follow-up paper, we will investigate the possible methods we could use
for assessing welfare and whether we can usefully transfer them to the
'welfare in the wild'.

In the end, questions of levels of animal welfare are empirical
questions and ones that should ultimately be answered using the tools of
animal welfare science, including a variety of specific behavioural and
physiological indicators and integrated welfare assessment frameworks
like the Five Domains model \[34\]. [We need accurate measurements of
the welfare of animals in a variety of captive and wild situations in
order to determine whether they actually do have greater welfare when
free or if perhaps the converse is true]{.underline}. So we finish this
paper with a call for further collection of such data.

This is not to imply that we think the collection of this data would be
a small or easy task. There are many challenges facing such an
endeavour. There are numerous differences between captive and wild
environments and the animals they contain that make controlled data
collection extremely difficult. To date, there is almost no work on
establishing methods for collecting such information. There are already
some initiatives that could help. Mason \[73\] argues for the use of the
'comparative method' to examine the biological differences between those
species that do well in captivity and those that do not. This would
allow us to better tailor species choices for holding captive animals.
As well as comparing ecology and behaviour, comparative welfare data
could help form part of this analysis. There are also many research
projects that look to compare the housing and husbandry conditions and
behavioural and activity patterns between captive and wild species to
try and identify welfare-relevant differences \[46,47,80\]. Veasey
\[77\] provides an example of how an empirical analysis of the
evolutionarily important cognitive and behavioural processes for a
species can help determine their likely welfare in a captive setting and
set priorities for improvement.

These are all important research programs, but what we see as primary
are measures of welfare for both captive and wild animals. This would
allow comparisons of chosen exemplars of each type for different species
to give some idea of which group has better welfare. Similarly,
longitudinal studies of the welfare of previously captive animals
released into the wild as part of reintroduction programs would provide
information regarding the welfare change as the amount of freedom
changes. These methods could give us not only information about the
instrumental value of freedom (whether animals in the wild actually have
access to better conditions for their welfare) but also, if properly
controlled, the intrinsic value of freedom. [If animals in the wild,
given the same access to resources and opportunities as captive
counterparts, have better welfare, then this gives us reason to think
that the freedom itself is contributing something to welfare, rather
than just in its provision of opportunities]{.underline}.

We see this as a fertile ground for future research and hope that it
could not only help settle the question of whether freedom is important
for welfare but also help tell us much more about how to better improve
the welfare of our captive animals. [If wild animals do have better
welfare, we can discover what conditions may be causing this and what it
is that our captive environments may still be lacking. If it turns out
that this is impossible to provide, or that freedom itself does provide
some additional welfare benefit of its own, then it would be time to
look seriously at the justifications provided for even the best types of
captivity, and whether they can overcome the welfare lack they
create]{.underline}. It is important that we look at the specific
conditions experienced by different animals---it is unlikely that there
will be a single blanket judgement that will apply to all species, given
their range of different needs and conditions provided \[28\]. [There
are likely to be some cognitively complex and highly mobile species,
such as cetaceans \[81\] and elephants \[78\], that unless their captive
circumstances are vastly changed from current practice, are unlikely to
experience good welfare in captivity; though we note that ongoing
research into captive elephant welfare is showing positive improvement
\[103\]. Other species, such as wide-ranging carnivores \[74\], may also
be poor candidates for captive holding]{.underline}. However, this will
almost certainly be a result of the instrumental deprivations of
captivity---primarily space and cognitive challenge---rather than the
intrinsic welfare harm of captivity itself. [The degree to which this
can be overcome, and thus whether such species should continue to be
held, will depend largely on knowledge and resource
availability]{.underline}. Already some species that have shown to be
excessively challenging to provide for in captivity, such as the
nutritionally specialised African pangolins or escape-artist Cape
clawless otters, have largely been phased out from captive holding for
these reasons \[9\]. [We must also pay attention to **differences in
personality**---both between species and between individuals within a
species---that can affect the welfare impact of captivity]{.underline}
\[104\]. The collection of further welfare data will help make the right
decisions about which animals, if any, can do well when kept in zoos
\[105\].

6\. Conclusions

In this paper, we have discussed the possible ways in which freedom may
be valuable for animal welfare: i.e., either intrinsically or merely
instrumentally in terms of allowing access to a range of other goods.
Often, we have shown that claims of animal liberationists regarding the
harms of captivity are too strong. [Rather than a binary notion of
freedom, there is instead a continuum, of which different types can be
present to different degrees in both captivity and the wild, providing
both welfare harms and benefits in each. We argued that debates around
the ethics of captivity **cannot be addressed exclusively from the
armchair** and instead call for further research into the comparative
welfare of zoo and wild animals in order to make progress on these
issues]{.underline}. Only through reaching an empirical understanding of
the welfare impact of freedom can we settle these debates as to its
desirability[. We may disagree with a practice because it sits wrongly
within our **preferred ethical framework**, but we cannot infer from
this that there is a welfare problem. We need science to say whether or
not it is bad for the animal themselves. Just because we do not like
something does not automatically mean it is bad for that species, and it
is something we can only establish through study, **not our own
assumptions**]{.underline}. It may turn out that some animals will have
poorer welfare in captivity, and these would be species that should not
be kept (as has been suggested for cetaceans, elephants and great apes).
[However, other species are very flexible and seem to do very well in
captivity in a variety of enclosures. Ring-tailed lemurs are an example
of this sort of animal that breeds well and shows few welfare
problems]{.underline}. Only through the collection of data, rather than
the ongoing presentation of competing intuitions and arguments, can we
hope to solve this debate on the value of freedom for welfare. [However,
even once such data is collected, it **does not automatically tell us
what actions we should take** regarding animals]{.underline}.

Even once we establish the level of welfare benefit or detriment
experienced by captive animals, [there is then, of course, a further
question as to what we should do]{.underline}. No one doubts that we
should, at a minimum, be constantly looking to improve captive standards
to give our animals the best lives possible. [However, we may also think
that knowledge about an animal's welfare or interests is insufficient to
settle the ethical question on whether or not we should hold it.
Particularly, ethical views based on rights might assert that animals
have rights to liberty, regardless of whether or not it is
harmful]{.underline}. Even if we found animal welfare in captivity to be
good, we might still think the practice is wrong. [Our responsibilities
to animals will depend on many factors, including our background ethical
theories, the needs of the animals, and our relationships to them.
Conversely, even if freedom is found to be good for welfare, it may not
make captivity impermissible if the welfare loss is compensated by other
benefits]{.underline}. If captivity and deprivation of freedom are
harmful to animals, then we need to look at under which conditions such
activities may be justified, a project undertaken by many authors and
one which we will not attempt to repeat here (e.g., \[1,15,25\]).

While often the debate on keeping captive animals turns on whether or
not it is justified by the benefits zoos provide, such as conservation,
education, recreation and research (see, for example, the discussion in
\[6\]), here we did not examine the arguments for or against these
justifications, as our focus was on whether keeping them captive will
harm their welfare. It seems true that taking or breeding animals into
the captive situation of zoos creates a special relationship with
obligations to meet the needs of the animals cared for. We may think
that we need to give these animals at least as good a life as the one
they would have had in the wild (DeGrazia's 'comparable life
requirement' \[15\]); though, as discussed, this condition may not be as
difficult to meet as some may assume. If captivity is not harmful to
welfare, then this may extend our perceived permissibility of the act of
keeping captive animals. As with all debates of this type, it is highly
likely to be context-sensitive, and as such, it would not make sense to
attempt to lay out definitive rules or prescriptions.

Here, [we just looked at whether the welfare of captive animals is
necessarily worse than that of wild animals and how we could discover
this without judging what this will tell us about the permissibility of
the practice or to what degree it harms the animals
involved]{.underline}. In the words of the eminent zoo biologist,
Professor Terry Maple: "[We can continue to debate issues such as
freedom, or we can work to improve the lives of both captive and wild
animals." \[106\] (p. 29). In the end, what is most important is that we
continue to collect information about **specific harms and benefits**
and use these to try and do the best we can to **ensure good lives** for
all animals]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--Factory Farming Good

#### The animals [need]{.underline} to be factory-farmed \-\-- it's good for them!

Jenny **Splitter** 2-14-20**18**, Jenny is an independent journalist who
covers food, agriculture, climate and science for outlets like The
Washington Post, Vox, Slate, New York Magazine, Parents, and Mental

https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/no-8-winter-2018/better-living-through-technology
//MDC

The ability to express natural behavior has consistently appeared in
animal welfare discussions since the codification of the "Five Freedoms"
by the UK Farm Animal Welfare Council in 1979. This framework, which
still guides most animal welfare audits around the world, was adapted
from the British government's 1965 Brambell Report, which urged
intensive livestock producers to provide animals the freedom "to stand
up, lie down, turn around, groom themselves, and stretch their limbs."
These ideas evolved into the fourth of the Five Freedoms: the "freedom
to express normal behavior: by providing sufficient space, proper
facilities, and company of the animal's own kind."\[7\]

Feedlots, while imposing a relatively moderate form of confinement on
beef cattle, undoubtedly restrict "normal behavior." According to a 2007
survey conducted by agricultural economists F. Bailey Norwood and Jayson
Lusk, the majority of American consumers explicitly prioritize such
natural behavior and outdoor access as their preferred metrics of animal
welfare over protection, shelter, and comfort.\[8\] Nevertheless, [the
remaining four freedoms explicitly uphold those latter rights: freedom
from hunger and thirst; from discomfort; from pain, injury, and disease;
and from fear and distress]{.underline}. An uncomfortable truth is that
these categories of concern don't always neatly overlap. In fact, they
often conflict --- [freedom to roam also means freedom to succumb to
predation, extreme weather, deprivation, and disease. Livestock
confinement first emerged in the late 1940s in part for that very
reason]{.underline}.\[9\]

This trade-off is not easily mitigated by farmers, especially those
running small operations. Lusk and Norwood's survey [participants might
prefer the idea of small, pasture-based farms, but those systems have
the potential to expose their animals to conditions with serious welfare
ramifications. Vulnerability to **predation** has long troubled
ranchers, and continues to do so as predators like bears, wolves, and
mountain lions are reintroduced, particularly in the American
West.\[10\] Cattle left to pasture are often exposed to **extreme heat
or cold** --- conditions that are exacerbated by a paucity of shade or
shelter]{.underline}. (Of course, feedlots clustered in the Midwest and
Texas also expose cattle to hot summer days, often without shade.) [When
grazing lands are overstocked, **poor nutrition and even starvation**
can result. Pasture, meanwhile, may offer the more "natural" choice of
diet, but it can also result in "**pasture bloat**," which, if not
treated promptly, tends to result in swift death]{.underline}.\[11\]
Poor water quality, failure to provide preventive health care, and lack
of consistent monitoring all further increase the incidence of injury
and illness.\[12\]

[Freedom to roam also means freedom to succumb to **predation, extreme
weather, deprivation, and disease**]{.underline}.

On a feedlot, in contrast, [precise control over the animal's diet and
medical care offers a **stable and predictable environment**, which in
turn can mean healthy animals, even if those animals themselves might
prefer more room to roam about]{.underline}. Large "corporate" feedlot
systems are also more likely to have the resources to pay for the kind
of robust health program needed to provide good and consistent care. An
enormous operation like Cactus Feeders in Amarillo, Texas, with 527,000
head of cattle across nine feedyards, employs several full-time
veterinarians. Tiffany Cattle, a smaller, family-run operation in
Herington, Kansas, with 32,000 head at two locations, relies on both an
on-call veterinarian and their own staff, who play a role not dissimilar
to a nurse practitioner's.

That is not to say that individual feedlot operators don't impinge on
their animals' lives in meaningful ways, nor that welfare cannot be
improved across the system as a whole. [But intensive livestock
operations have developed and consolidated in such a way as to maximize
the potential for the vast numbers of cattle that pass through them to
live a life (albeit delimited) as **free of harm** as
possible]{.underline}.

### 1AR\-\--Factory Farming Good

#### Factory farming is best \-\-- new tech solves downsides and you should reject the negative's appeal to "nature."

Jenny **Splitter** 2-14-20**18**, Jenny is an independent journalist who
covers food, agriculture, climate and science for outlets like The
Washington Post, Vox, Slate, New York Magazine, Parents, and Mental
Floss. "Better Living Through Technology"

//MDC

[What is "natural" does not always coincide with what is humane, nor
does it have much to do with life on a farm. After all, what is normal
behavior for a breed of cattle prized for its docility, on pasture or on
a feedyard]{.underline}? Whether it's the massive Cactus Feeders or the
famed Polyface Farm of Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma,\[14\]
agriculture itself isn't natural; it's human engineering. From Kansas
calf rancher Debbie Blythe choosing a breeding bull for better marbling
to scientist Alison Van Eenennaam genetically engineering a hornless
dairy cow, we humans are constantly modifying these animals to produce
better tasting, healthier, more efficient, and cost-effective food.

[Healthier, lower-stress animals mean tastier meat, so there's plenty of
**economic incentive** for farmers to do right by their livestock. Most
sincerely believe that animal welfare is a deep responsibility, an
obligation of stewardship.]{.underline} But farmers face many difficult
and simultaneous challenges --- fluctuating markets, severe weather,
increasing consumer demand for transparency, and pressure to keep up
with technological changes, not to mention the responsibility of
figuring out who will take over the family farm at a time when the
younger generation either doesn't want to or doesn't have the
experience. In the difficult business of animal husbandry, a farmer is
sometimes just doing his or her best to balance welfare with many other
significant competing interests.

In this sense, [animal welfare can take on the guise of an engineering
problem: one that science and technology, and the production systems
that are best positioned to deploy them, can help solve. Indeed,
scientists have bred low-fat CRISPR pigs that suffer less in cold
temperatures and chickens that develop fewer leg
problems]{.underline}.\[15\],\[16\] Shane Tiffany describes the cattle
tags that could one day be used to detect a fever before the animal
shows signs of sickness, though he is careful to note that these tags
aren't yet cost-effective enough to implement on his farm. Any such
investment in animal welfare ultimately has to matter to the consumer.
We're the ones paying for it.

Ultimately, whether free range or feedlot finished, the [welfare of
livestock **depends on the humans** entrusted with their
care.]{.underline}

While the distributed nature of this reality does make regulating for
animal welfare difficult, a few workarounds have emerged. Norwood and
Lusk, for instance, recommend the "Animal Welfare Approved" label in
their book Compassion, by the Pound. They do note, however, that other
humane labels have had considerable problems with fraud and a lack of
oversight. When I mentioned this label to Shawn Tiffany, he had no
objections to it, but said he sees it more as a brand than an industry
game-changer.

[Perhaps a more efficacious move to improve animal welfare would be to
direct our attention toward feedlots with the **intent to improve rather
than disparage**]{.underline}. Because they indisputably dominate the
beef production system, and will almost certainly continue to do so for
the foreseeable future, even modest measures could have a significant
impact on the well-being of beef cattle at large. [Moreover, with their
technologically enhanced feeds, shelter, and care, feedlots already
inherently possess the tools of their own betterment.]{.underline}

There's a limit to how much we can improve the life of the animals we
eat. But the feedlot standard --- approximately four months of
confinement, a meticulously engineered diet, constant care, shelter, and
dry ground --- has a lot going for it. Cows, in the end, are not just
like us. If we're going to continue to eat them --- and it looks like we
are --- they'll be better off if we can make peace with the systems that
are best positioned to mitigate their pain and distress, and improve
their comfort and well-being, as they make their way from farm to plate.

//MDC

How is lab-grown meat made?

The term "lab-grown meat" might sound off-putting. However, [labs are
only involved in supporting ongoing research and development. Once they
begin to produce at scale, cultured meat companies will swap out
laboratories for facilities resembling microbreweries---a far cry from
the industrial farms that profit from the abuse and slaughter of
sentient animals]{.underline}.

Instead of using slaughtered animals, [lab-grown meat is made by
carefully removing a few muscle cells from a living animal. The **pain
is typically relieved** with local anesthesia. The animal experiences a
momentary twinge of discomfort, not unlike the feeling of getting a
routine blood test at the doctor's]{.underline}.

Then, a lab technician places the harvested cells in bioreactors before
adding them to a bath of nutrients. The cells grow and multiply,
producing actual muscle tissue, which scientists shape into edible
"scaffoldings."

These scaffoldings can transform lab-grown cells into steaks, chicken
nuggets, burger patties, and fish products. National University of
Singapore scientists have even begun using sorghum grain to produce
cultivated pork. These offerings could sway pork eaters who are wary of
parasites and disease.

The [final product is an actual cut of meat, ready to be marinated,
breaded, grilled, baked, or fried---**no animal slaughter
required**]{.underline}! Cells from a single cow can produce an
astonishing 175 million quarter-pounder burgers.

Lab-grown meat is more humane and sustainable

Lab-grown meat is created from the same animal cells as traditional
meat. [The key distinction lies in the process---lab-grown meat
eliminates the need for breeding, raising, and slaughtering animals,
offering a **more humane** and sustainable alternative to conventional
farming practices.]{.underline}

One of the [most compelling aspects of lab-grown meat is its potential
to **reduce animal suffering**. By harvesting cells without killing the
animal, this innovative approach addresses the ethical concerns of
consumers who oppose factory farming and industrialized
slaughterhouses.]{.underline}

As Brian Spears, founder of New Age Meats, explains, "People want meat.
They don't want slaughter." This sentiment reflects a growing demand for
products that align with the values of compassion and sustainability
without requiring individuals to give up their dietary preferences.

In addition to its ethical appeal, lab-grown meat could serve as a
practical solution for meeting the global demand for meat while
addressing the environmental and health challenges associated with
traditional meat production. Industrial farming is a major contributor
to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution.

By bypassing the need for large-scale animal agriculture, lab-grown meat
has the potential to significantly reduce the industry's environmental
footprint. [Furthermore, it can be produced under controlled conditions
that minimize health risks, such as antibiotic resistance and
contamination from pathogens like E. coli.]{.underline}

Lab-grown meat represents a revolutionary shift in how we think about
food production. It merges scientific innovation with ethical and
environmental consciousness, providing a tangible alternative to
unsustainable practices. At the same time, it is not without challenges,
such as high production costs and reliance on inevitable animal-derived
by-products. [Ongoing technological advancements and scaling promise to
address these hurdles]{.underline}.

For many, [enjoying real meat without traditional methods' moral and
environmental consequences offers a hopeful glimpse into a future where
food choices are both satisfying and responsible]{.underline}.

#### Moral and tech evolution will [inevitably]{.underline} stop animal exploitation and prevent [wild animal]{.underline} suffering\-\--that's a [far bigger]{.underline} impact

**Leenaert 16 --** Tobias Leenaert, Cofounder of Ethical Vegetarian
Alternative, Longtime Speaker, Trainer, Strategist, Author of How to
Create a Vegan World: A Pragmatic Approach, "Would You Press The Button
To Make Humanity Go Extinct?", The Vegan Strategist, 10-26,
http://veganstrategist.org/2016/10/26/would-you-press-the-button-to-make-humanity-go-extinct/

[I often hear people entertaining the thought of making humanity
disappear from the universe because, as a species, we are causing a lot
of suffering, to]{.underline} ourselves and [other sentient beings and
the planet]{.underline}. One thought experiment goes like this: if you
could make humanity painlessly disappear with the pressing of a button,
would you press it? Or, slightly reframing the experiment so that you
can make an abstraction of your own responsibility: would you stop
someone else from pressing the button?

In the animal rights/vegan movement, more [[people]{.mark} seem to be in
[favor]{.mark} of human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} than among the
general population (just my anecdotal experience). That's not hard to
understand. People become animal rights activists and/or vegans because
[they have learned about the horrible suffering humans inflict on
animals]{.underline}, for food, clothing, research or entertainment. [It
is tempting to think that the planet would be a better place without
Homo sapiens]{.underline}, and given that in our thought experiment, no
humans would really suffer (it's just a matter of an instant, and no
humans are left to deplore the new situation), we might say: where's the
harm?

Now, from the viewpoint of the notoriously tricky field of population
ethics, there's a lot of stuff to say here. Apart from the consequences
for other species and the environment, we could talk about whether the
universe in general is a worse or a better place with humans gone. If
there is, on average, more value than disvalue in humans' lives, it
might seem that the net result is negative. But if there's more misery
than happiness, this could be good. We could also think about the value
of future people being born. They will obviously not be born if we let
humanity go extinct. I won't go into this minefield here, because I do
not have strong opinions about these issues, because I can't seem to
wrap my head around them, and mainly because here I want to touch on
some other factors.

[These are the reasons why [I would **not**]{.mark} press the
button.]{.underline}

[1. Humans may do a lot of damage, but they're also
wonderful.]{.underline}

[We all know the horrors]{.underline} that we cause in the world: [to
other people and]{.underline} annually to [65 billion farmed
animals]{.underline} (excluding fish). [We screw up our
environment]{.underline} and use a lot of finite natural resources.
There's no need to write a long and depressing list here. [However, we
can also focus on all the good that we do. Never in the history of our
planet]{.underline} -- or, as far as we know, the universe -- [has there
been a species that invests so much time in making things better for
others. Look at the millions of people active in the non-profit sector.
Look at those trying to help the weakest and the poorest]{.underline}.
Look at all the beautiful things we do. [Seeing Homo sapiens in this
light, it becomes really problematic and unfair to just call us a
shipwreck of a species that only does damage]{.underline}.

[2. [Humans]{.mark} still [have]{.mark} a **lot of [potential to
improve]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In many ways [our [history is **just beginning**]{.mark}. Moments ago we
were mere apes in trees. We developed culture, learning and education
only recently]{.underline}. We -- in the richer countries at least --
only recently managed to create comfortable environments where we no
longer need to worry about food and shelter, so that we can spend more
time on other things. [**[Violence is declining]{.mark}** and this era
is, counterintuitively to some, the **most peaceful era** in
history]{.underline} (read Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our
Nature). [[We're]{.mark} still **[expanding the circle of]{.mark} our
[moral concern]{.mark}**. We'll]{.underline} probably [have to work less
in the future and will devote even more time to creating change for
ourselves and others. And there is the promise]{.underline} (at least
for techno-optimists) [of **[future tech]{.mark}nological
[advancements]{.mark}** that [can]{.mark} help us [have a
**huge**]{.mark} **positive [impact]{.mark}** on ourselves and our
planet]{.underline}.

[3. Humans might be able to **help other species** further down the
road.]{.underline}

In the future, [[given]{.mark} more moral growth and technological
[improvements]{.mark}, rather than having a net negative impact on other
species, [our impact could become **net positive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Arguably [the [**biggest source** of suffering]{.mark} for animals
[is]{.mark} nature/[the **natural condition**. Animals die **by the
billions**]{.mark} because [of hunger, disease]{.mark}, parasitism, the
[climate, predation]{.mark}]{.underline} (see my post The extremely
inconvenient truth of wild animal suffering). Maybe **[in the future,
[we can limit]{.mark}]{.underline}** some of [**[this]{.mark}
suffering**. The [same]{.mark} applies [if]{.mark} at some point in our
more distant future, [we bump into]{.mark} sentient [life on **other
planets**]{.mark}. Chances are there is suffering there, and [if]{.mark}
by that time [we have **advanced**]{.mark} **enough morally and
technologically**, [we may]{.mark} be able to
**[help]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course there is the chance that some
other species in our corner of the universe is already at that level,
thus making our own progress less important. But certainly in the event
that we're the only "advanced" ones around (in this region of the
universe), [[it becomes **very important**]{.mark} **that [we
survive]{.mark}** and grow to help. It would be a pity if
everything]{.underline} we have and everything [we are was
lost]{.underline}, and [the universe would need to restart]{.underline}
with another species to reach our level of development. **[Lots of time
and lives lost]{.underline}**.

As you see, I'm thinking a bit ahead. And why not? Some will believe
this is speculation and science fiction that has no relevance for the
problems and suffering at hand. But if we don't destroy ourselves, we
have to assume we're going to be here for a long, long time still. And

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

AI offers significant advantages for enhancing animal welfare \[61\].
Primarily, [AI enables meticulous recognition of animal behaviors,
emotions, as well as the prognosis and diagnosis of diseases. This level
of accuracy allows for timely interventions, augmenting the overall
welfare of animals]{.underline}. Additionally, AI systems automate tasks
including environmental management and facility sanitation, minimizing
human errors, and ensuring uniform quality in animal care \[22, 27\].
[Furthermore, AI revolutionizes animal nutrition and health, formulating
individualized nutrition strategies and proactively addressing health
concerns before they escalate.]{.underline}

However, the application of different AI techniques also has certain
limitations (Figure 6). For example, computer vision-based methods like
CNNs can accurately recognize animals and their behaviors, but may
struggle in low light or cluttered environments \[83, 84\]. Sensor-based
approaches efficiently collect behavioral data, yet interpreting complex
emotions remains difficult \[85\]. ML techniques effectively analyze
nutrition and health parameters, but lack human-like comprehension of
animal needs \[86\]. Knowledge-based expert systems enable disease
diagnosis, but rely on predefined rules and have limited learning
capabilities. Overall, a combination of different AI methods can help
overcome individual limitations and provide more robust solutions.

\[Figure 6 omitted\]

To develop and train AI systems, a substantial amount of data are
essential \[87\]. However, in certain cases, data availability may be
limited or difficult to obtain, posing challenges to the effectiveness
of AI applications \[88, 89\]. While AI can effectively monitor the
physiological indicators of animals, understanding their emotions and
behaviors remains beyond its capabilities. Consequently, there is a risk
of failing to identify crucial welfare issues. Additionally, the
successful implementation of AI technology requires ongoing training and
maintenance, necessitating personnel with the relevant knowledge and
skills to manage and utilize these systems. Unfortunately, the absence
of such knowledge and training can potentially impede the adoption of
this technology. Implementation of AI systems, especially in expansive
facilities, can incur significant initial expenses, potentially
hindering adoption by smaller entities or individual proprietors \[90\].
Moreover, persistent surveillance of animals via AI ignites ethical
debates concerning their privacy and autonomy \[91\]. A judicious
equilibrium between welfare monitoring and preserving their independence
is vital.

To propel animal care advancements through AI, various avenues warrant
exploration. [Integration of AI with the IoT can foster more intelligent
animal care facilities, facilitating perpetual monitoring and
enhancement of all facets, from diet to habitat \[4, 19\]. Real-time
data from IoT devices can be analyzed by AI algorithms to provide
**optimal care** for animals]{.underline} \[9\]. Secondly, the future
may witness the development of AI systems capable of personalizing care
plans for individual animals based on their unique behaviors, emotions,
and health needs \[16, 46\]. Similar to how AI customizes ads for
individuals, personalized animal care can lead to better outcomes.
Finally, collaborative research involving technologists, veterinarians,
and animal behaviorists is essential. This interdisciplinary approach
ensures that AI technology in animal care is developed and implemented
in a way that truly benefits the animals. By combining expertise from
different fields, advancements can be made in AI algorithms, data
collection, and ethical considerations, ultimately improving animal
welfare.

[By leveraging the precision, automation, and holistic management
capabilities of AI, addressing the limitations and concerns, and
exploring future directions, the potential for enhancing animal welfare
through AI technology is promising]{.underline}. With continued research
and responsible implementation, the integration of AI in animal care
will likely contribute to the well-being of animals, sustainable
agriculture, and veterinary practices.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, [the utilization of AI offers **substantial potential**
for enhancing animal welfare. By capitalizing on its advantages,
addressing limitations and concerns, and exploring future directions, we
can make significant progress in this field]{.underline}. To achieve
this, it is crucial to continue conducting research, implement AI
technology responsibly, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.
[These efforts will contribute to **improved animal well-being**,
sustainable agriculture, and advancements in veterinary
practices]{.underline}. However, it is vital that we remain mindful of
ethical considerations and ensure that AI is used in a responsible and
ethical manner, thereby creating a brighter future for animals.

German public imaginaries of gene editing technologies in animal
agriculture" //MDC

Entrenched sociotechnical imaginaries of genetic technologies

As we have shown, what emerged from our focus groups is that [the
majority of [participants did not support]{.mark} the [vanguard
vision]{.mark} developed by the consortium---[that gene editing]{.mark}
technologies [could benefit animal]{.mark} health and [welfare]{.mark},
and small- to mid-scale farms. Instead[, they held an entrenched
socio-technical imaginary]{.mark} that was [rooted in a storyline where
genetic technologies]{.mark} can [only benefit factory
farming]{.mark}]{.underline}. This storyline was built from arguments
that tied genetic modification technologies in agriculture exclusively
to industrial-scale farmers and the maximization of yields as well as
profits for large corporations. The vanguard vision of gene editing as
beneficial for small- or medium-scale farming focused on animal health
[[was]{.mark} largely [seen]{.mark} by most of our participants [as a
deception]{.mark} and 'trojan horse' to ultimately normalize these
technologies for industrial farming usages, [despite having been]{.mark}
established in collaboration with and **[endorsed by non-industrial
farmers]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Many of the concerns raised by the participants who were critical about
factory farming, and the food industry more broadly, are well warranted.
These concerns are not isolated to Germany but represented across
multiple studies, raising criticisms of gene editing technologies
potential to exacerbate industrialized agricultural systems, increase
corporate agribusiness power, and entrench existing inequalities and
harms (Lindberg et al. 2023; Montenegro de Wit 2022). Especially since
there are a range of complex barriers to developing ethical, equitable,
and sustainable food systems when the power to enact change tends to
rest in corporate hands (Pechlaner 2024; Lindberg et al. 2023). However,
[we want to point out that these concerns and a [predominant focus on
large-scale agriculture]{.mark} appears to [keep publics from
imagining]{.mark} small- to medium-scale [agricultural futures that
align with technology use]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

A key finding from this study is that once there is a specific imaginary
established in a national context, it can be difficult to change it.
This finding is similar to work on other national sociotechnical
imaginaries, where the [technopolitical history of a state heavily
influences how particular technologies can become welcomed in a local
context]{.underline} (Felt 2015). Felt has argued (and shown in the
Austrian case) that typically "technologies that can be constructed as
'local' are embraced more easily" (ibid., 109). However, what is
striking in our study is that regardless of the efforts of our
consortium members to embed gene editing technologies in a local,
Bavarian, animal agricultural context, and even aligned with Bavaria's
innovation paradigm as outlined by Pfotenhauer et al. (2023), their
efforts were either ignored by participants or contested.

Our project partners' iterative dialogue with farmers and breeding
organizations, and general support of a RRI approach to technology
development, combined with their acknowledgment of Germany's
technopolitical history with GMOs and the ongoing struggles of livestock
farmers in the state and nation, ultimately did not alter how the public
imagined this technology. [It appears that in the case of
agriculture---and specifically animal agriculture---"localness" may not
be enough to overcome the intense politicization of particular
technologies, especially genetic technologies. In light of this, we want
to pick up the question of what does it mean if there are
[narratives]{.mark} about technology that [are so **deeply entrenched**
that actors who wish to]{.mark} imagine otherwise, or [produce a new
vision, cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}?
