[The loss of [bio]{.mark}logical [diversity]{.mark}, or biodiversity,
refers to the decline in the variety and variability of life forms on
Earth, encompassing species extinction, habitat degradation, and
ecosystem disruption. This loss undermines ecosystem resilience, reduces
natural resources, and threatens human well-being. But [what can we do
about it]{.mark}?]{.underline} It must be out of our hands, or the
result of anthropogenic climate change, which certain political parties
try to deny at every turn. Despite the enormity of the problem, there
are concrete actions we can take to mitigate biodiversity loss. [One of
the [most **significant actions is** ]{.mark}**the [ratification of
the]{.mark} Convention on Biological Diversity
([CBD]{.mark}).**]{.underline}

[[The CBD plays a **crucial role** in global efforts to halt
biodiversity loss by setting international conservation goals, promoting
**sustainable use of**]{.mark} **biological [resources]{.mark}**[, and
ensuring fair sharing]{.mark} of genetic resource benefits.
Significantly, in 2022, [all CBD member states adopted a set of global
targets for 2030 called the Global Biodiversity Framework]{.mark} to put
humanity on a path [to live more harmoniously with nature]{.mark}. These
targets range from quantitative area-based conservation efforts to the
utilization of nature based solutions in preventing the spread of
invasive species and promoting access to benefit sharing of genetic
information. However, a major hurdle remains. [While almost every nation
in the world has ratified]{.mark} this essential multilateral
environmental agreement (MEA), **[two lone holdouts have
not.]{.mark} **]{.underline}

[The CBD provides a global framework, as the international legal
instrument ratified by 196 nations, for the following areas:
conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of biodiversity and the
equitable sharing of genetic resources (CBD Secretariat,
2022).]{.underline} Article 1 of the Convention clearly outlines the
objectives of conserving and protecting global biodiversity. "The
objectives of this Convention, to be pursued in accordance with its
relevant provisions, are the conservation of biological diversity, the
sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of
the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources" (U.N.,
1992). Article 2 of the Convention goes on to clearly define biological
diversity as "the variability among living organisms from all sources
including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems
and the ecological complexes of which they are part" (U.N., 1992).

As the rate of species extinction increased with alarming speed in the
last several decades, due to anthropogenic activities such as climate
change and increased land use, the global response enacted by the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) resulted in the formation of an Ad
Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in 1988 (CBD
Secretariat, 2022). The Ad Hoc Working Group unveiled the text at the
Nairobi Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention
on Biological Diversity in 1992. The Convention was opened for signature
in 1993 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development,
also known as the Earth Summit. This meeting took place in Brazil where
the Convention under which the Paris Agreement sits was also adopted,
including the three MEAs known as the Rio Conventions. 

[The CBD was initially signed by 168 nations and entered into force on
December 29, 1993 (CBD Secretariat, 2022). According to the Secretariat,
the CBD was inspired by a global commitment to sustainable development[.
"**It represents a dramatic step forward in the conservation of
biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the
fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (CBD Secretariat, 2022). This
impressive achievement did not just happen overnight but was the result
of many steps on the way to a global agreement, including several
negotiating sessions and ad hoc working group meetings by legal and
technical experts which then culminated in the conference to adopt the
Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD Secretariat, 2022).

[[The responsibility to implement the Convention rests with the
countries that have **ratified the treaty,**]{.mark} also known as the
Conference of the Parties (COP),]{.underline} which reviews progress and
identifies new priorities. This is done through an ongoing global forum
of meetings where member states, nongovernmental organizations and
academics can share ideas and compare strategies (CBD Secretariat,
2022). Within the three main stated goals of the Convention, the
agreement also recognized for the first time that these areas are common
concerns of all of mankind (CBD Secretariat, 2022). 

[[Additional areas also covered]{.mark} by the Convention
[include]{.mark}: ]{.underline}

- [Measures and incentives ]{.underline}

- [[Access to genetic resources]{.underline}]{.mark}

- [Access to technology]{.underline}

- [Technical and scientific [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}

- [Impact assessment]{.underline}

- [[Education and public awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}

- [Provision of financial resources]{.underline}

- [Reporting on treaty commitments (CBD Secretariat, 2022).]{.underline}

While the degree of international cooperation on conserving biodiversity
through the CBD is truly breathtaking, what is also notable [is [**the
one country** besides the Holy See **that has yet to ratify the
Convention - the United States**]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Since the CBD
was entered into force in the early 1990's, [Republican lawmakers in the
United States have continued to block ratification]{.mark}. Some
lawmakers [claim the CBD would infringe on U.S. sovereignty]{.mark} and
put commercial interests at risk, which have been talking points for the
Republican Party for decades (Jones, 2021).]{.underline} In fact,
ratifying the CBD would signify a recommitment of the U.S. to global
environmental leadership while benefiting domestic industry groups in
the process. Even with the Biden administration prioritizing climate
change and conservation efforts, reversing course on many Trump-era
policies, ratification of the CBD is still challenging due to Republican
obstructionism. Under the U.S. Constitution, a two-thirds vote in the
Senate is the only requirement left needed to ratify the CBD (Jones,
2021).

[[With America's continued absence from the Convention,]{.mark}
participating only as an observer or non-party member, [global efforts
to avert more extinctions are unfortunately likely to fail]{.mark}
(Jones, 2021). In other words, [countless species around the world will
experience extirpation, or continue to go extinct
entirely]{.mark}]{.underline}. One cause for optimism may be that the
rest of the global community, which includes almost all nations on the
planet, is committed to protecting biodiversity and conserving our
precious natural resources. In 2024, the Working Group of the Parties,
also known as the WGP, is meeting in Geneva to review progress on the
current work program, including access to information, ratification of
the GMO amendment, promotion of the Convention, and to consider the
impact of the war in Ukraine on the Convention\'s implementation.
[**[For biodiversity's sake, we should all urge the United States to
finally ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity, and lead on this
issue that the rest of the world has clearly deemed of utmost
importance]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Fifty [House Democrats]{.mark} --- with the support of more than 100
environmental groups and academics --- [demanded the creation of
a]{.mark} [national]{.mark} [biod]{.mark}iversity [strategy]{.mark} in a
letter to President Biden on Tuesday.]{.underline} "The loss of
biodiversity presents a direct threat to our security, health, and

sent by Rep. [Joe Neguse](https://thehill.com/people/joe-neguse/)
(D-Colo.). "As species decline and habitats degrade, we lose critical
ecosystem services that provide us with clean water, fertile soils,
food, and the very air we breathe." [The letter follows up on Neguse's
January 2021 proposal, [H.R.
69](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/69),
for a federal biodiversity strategy. While the representatives who
signed Tuesday's letter were all Democrats, the 39 [co-sponsors

[one]{.mark} [Republican]{.mark}, Rep.]{.underline} [[Brian

[(Pa.).]{.underline} Tuesday's letter commended Biden for his efforts
thus far to address "compounding environmental crises," including his
commitment to conserving 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.
But the signers also warned that as many as a million species worldwide
are at risk of extinction, while in North America alone, almost 3
billion birds have disappeared since 1970. As habitats and critical
ecosystems degrade, the availability of clean water, air and food also
diminishes, according to the letter. The World Economic Forum has
likewise identified biodiversity loss as one of the top five threats to
the global economy, the signers added. Not only does the country's loss
of biodiversity imperil human health and cause economic distress, it
"also disproportionately impacts communities of color, low-income
communities, tribal communities, and others that have historically faced
environmental injustice," according to the letter. [The letter asks that
the government address the "five drivers of biodiversity loss," which
H.R. 69 defines as human alteration of terrestrial and marine
environments, exploitation of wildlife, acceleration of climate change,
introduction of invasive species, and pollution of air, land and
water]{.underline}. The federal biodiversity strategy, according to the
letter, should also "promote social equity and environmental justice"
while coordinating the national response with other such initiatives
around the world. ["The United States ought to be playing a global
leadership role in addressing the biodiversity crisis, and with
President]{.underline} [[Joe
Biden]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/) [in office we
have the opportunity to do so," Neguse [said in a
statement](https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-neguse-urges-adoption-of-national-biodiversity-strategy-says-action-to-protect-ecosystems-and-wildlife-is-urgent-).]{.underline}
"The decline of biodiversity presents a direct threat to our nation's
well-being, and it's time for the U.S. to take an ambitious
whole-of-government approach to address these issues." Jamie Rappaport
Clark, president and CEO of the Defenders of Wildlife organization,
described biodiversity as "the foundation our planet is built on,"
emphasizing how humans "depend on nature and the richness of species
within it." "If the extinction crisis continues unabated, our nation
will lose our unique landscapes, wildlife and biodiversity forever," she
said in a statement. "It is imperative for President Biden to establish
a national biodiversity strategy before it's too late." [On the same day
that Neguse and his colleagues sent their letter to the president,
Defenders of Wildlife and several other national conservation groups
launched a campaign to advocate for a domestic biodiversity
strategy.]{.underline} Worldwide, 193 other countries have already
developed similar such plans, the cohort [said in a
statement](https://defenders.org/newsroom/environmental-organizations-federal-and-state-leaders-call-national-biodiversity-strategy).
[The [movement to implement a]{.mark} [federal]{.mark} government
[strategy]{.mark} [is garnering]{.mark} increasing [support]{.mark},
[with 120]{.mark} [environmental organizations, scientists and]{.mark}
university [students]{.mark} across the U.S. [supporting its
creation]{.mark}, according to the groups.]{.underline} Addie Haughey,
legislative director of Earthjustice, called upon Biden to "take
concrete steps to prevent extinctions" such as bolstering the Endangered
Species Act and investing in the recovery of threatened species. "The
U.S. must take action to address the biodiversity crisis that continues
to worsen alongside the climate emergency because our own fate is
inextricably linked to the plants and animals with which we share this
planet," Haughey added.

## Canada/US Relations

#### CP Text: The United States federal government should decrease tariffs on Canada and make a binding agreement that tariffs will not be increased in the future. 

#### Tariff threats upset Canada and ruin relations -- reversing them solves

**Llana, 9/13** (Sara Miller Llana, reporter for the Christian Science
Monitor, quoting Gordon Ritchie, a former Canadian ambassador for trade
negotiations and deputy chief negotiator of the Canada-US free-trade
agreement, \"Amid trade fight, Canada returns to its roots in opposition
to US\', 9/13/18

[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Trump
threatens]{.underline}]{.mark} [the "ruination" of Canada]{.underline}
[in renegotiation of]{.underline} the North American Free Trade
Agreement ([NAFTA]{.underline}), [[Canadians are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[not only surprised, but]{.underline}
**[[angered]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Old complexes about the
Canadian-American relationship, one that has been among the most
peaceful in the world for two bordering countries, are resurfacing.
"[Trump is using the same old bullying tactics,]{.underline} it is like
200 years all over again," says Mr. Oatley, who on a blustery day is
standing at Lundy's Lane in Niagara Falls, site of one of the fiercest
battles of the War of 1812. No side could declare outright victory, not
unlike the competing visions of victory in the war itself. But for
British North America, the battle thwarted a US advance and takeover --
and showed how misguided the American Founding Father's war rhetoric
was. "You have to face bullies," Oatley says, adding that it is as true
now as then. "You can't run away from them." [Some have]{.underline}
**[dismissed]{.underline}** Mr. **[Trump's moves]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[boorishness]{.underline}** [that market
forces]{.underline} **[will]{.underline}** [eventually]{.underline}
**[curtail]{.underline}**. But his tactics have raised anxious questions
about how dependent Canada, which sends 75 percent of its exports south,
remains on the US. They\'ve also rekindled a form of nationalism, which
in many Western countries translates into the exclusion of others, but
in multicultural and multilingual Canada more often takes the shape of
anti-Americanism. "It's always there, the sense that we are different
than the Americans," says historian Jack Granatstein, who wrote the book
"Yankee Go Home? Canadians and Anti-Americanism," which traces an
undercurrent of anti-Americanism in Canadian society since the American
Revolution. "We are loyalists, they are rebels. We believe in peace,
order, and good government, not life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. There\'s always a sense that somehow the United States is out
of step with us. And at no point is that clearer than the present."
"[[Trump has made every Canadian government]{.underline}]{.mark} that
follows [[aware that]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[you can't trust the
Americans now]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Formed in opposition to the US
Canada was built upon a vision that was explicitly distinct from the US,
starting as early as 1776. The Loyalists were the first significant wave
of English-speaking settlers in Canada and fundamental to its identity.
Today the United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada is still a
popular club -- Oatley sits on the board of the largest of the branches
in Niagara, loyalist heartland at the US border. Their patriotism is
seen in the initials "UE" they place after their names to affirm their
heritage. This region, along the Great Lakes, later became the main
theater of the War of 1812, with battlegrounds dotting the landscape
along the Niagara River. The conflict confirmed a wariness of the US and
the need to defend itself -- the war's resistance heroes are some of the
most celebrated historic figures -- which would continue through the
founding of Canada. [When]{.underline} the Province of Canada with [New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia joined together to create Canada]{.underline}
in 1867, **[the driving motivation was to resist an American
invasion]{.underline}** -- and American-style extremes. "We were
terrified of a United States that had just gone through a civil war,"
says Michael Adams, president of the Environics Institute for Survey
Research, which measures Canadian attitudes. "There were a lot of things
that Canadians didn\'t like about the United States -- slavery, civil
wars, guns, and violence," he says. "So we we actually formed ourselves
in opposition to the United States." In the last century, as the US grew
as the world's superpower, staking positions that were controversial
around the globe, Canada worked hard to find its own place, consuming
American culture and products but often at pains to define itself as,
above all, "not American." Canadian governments often disagreed with
American foreign policy positions, from the Vietnam War to the invasion
of Iraq in 2003. But trade barriers continued to fall, bringing down
with them political ones as well. Dan Ciuriak, an international trade
expert at the C.D. Howe Institute, a think tank in Toronto, says that
despite continual disputes, both economic and political, convergence has
been the dominant theme of the past generation, even after 9/11 when
fears of terrorism caused the US to fortify its borders. "In Canada and
the US there\'s this narrative of 'we don\'t just trade together, we
build things together, we do things together,' and while there was a
thickening of the border post-9/11, which was never really resolved,
there was still that sense that the relationship was this one of
partnership," he says. For many, Trump's actions have proven that
illusory. [Trump has been widely unpopular in Canada]{.underline} since
before the election, but **[[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}** issued on
the grounds of "national security" **[[were deeply offensive to most
Canadians]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Weeks later he dissed Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau after the Group of Seven meeting in Quebec [as "weak," an
insult that]{.underline} **[buoyed support for the Canadian
leader]{.underline}** [across the political spectrum]{.underline}. In
the latest spat, [the US seemed to shut Canada out of NAFTA
negotiations]{.underline}, forging a deal on the sidelines with Mexico
and then giving Canada a deadline to sign or leave it. [As talks have
stalled, [Trump has hurled successive insults, threatening to put
tariffs on cars]{.mark}]{.underline}, which TD Bank analysts have shown
could cost Canada 160,000 jobs, the majority in Ontario. [[Trump has
tried to back Canada in a corner]{.underline}]{.mark}, to force Ottawa
to open the Canadian dairy or cultural market or loosen the independent
trade dispute system. In the midst of negotiations he told reporters in
off-the-record comments that the US will not compromise with Canada.
"It's going to be so insulting they're not going to be able to make a
deal," he said, according to the Toronto Star, which published the
bombshell remarks. Canadians \'not intimidated\' Trudeau has been
criticized by some for misplaying the US, by others for playing it up.
"Trump stirs the nationalism, and Trudeau is riding it," Granatstein,
the historian, says. Oatley says Trudeau has no choice but to stand
strong. He says the US can\'t "ruin" Canada. "Trump could hurt us," he
says, "but that would hurt the US too." Trudeau said this week that auto
tariffs "would be devastating, obviously, to the Canadian auto industry,
but it would also be devastating to the American auto industry."
**[[Members of the US Congress]{.mark} and industry leaders [have come
out backing Canada]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [saying they will not support
a trade deal without all three original NAFTA signatories on
board.]{.underline} "[[Canadians are]{.underline}]{.mark} [shocked
and]{.underline} [[appalled,]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[but they\'re not
intimidated]{.mark}**.]{.underline} **[[All this mindless bluster is
really not affecting the Canadian position in these
negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}**," says Gordon Ritchie, a former
Canadian ambassador for trade negotiations and deputy chief negotiator
of the Canada-US free-trade agreement. "It\'s not just rhetoric to say
that Canada will only sign on to a good deal." But in the trade
maelstrom, attitudes have shifted. Since Trump was elected, more
Canadians hold unfavorable views of the US than favorable ones, for the
first time since Environics began measuring opinions in 1982. At the
grassroots level, the clash has translated into a surge of patriotism at
the grocery store and travel agency, with a #BuyCanadian movement taking
off on social media. When Canada announced \$12.6 billion in retaliatory
tariffs this summer, only 20 percent of Canadians said they were
opposed, despite the vulnerable economic position that Canada finds
itself in. And while Canadians say their protest is not directed at
Americans, individual Americans are feeling it. Eddy Ng, an economics
professor at Dalhousie University's Rowe School of Business in Halifax,
is conducting a study of American expats in Canada with Thomas Koellen
of the University of Bern in Switzerland. The two started collecting
experiences in the Canadian workplace after Trump was inaugurated.
Professor Ng says that more than half of respondents say they feel they
are treated differently because of nationality. At the same time
Canadians, whose multiculturalism is celebrated as part of the national
identity, don't see American-bashing as politically incorrect. That
inconsistency goes back to geography and history, Ng suggests. "We
always define ourselves by what the Americans are not." Testing the
limits of US-Canadian friendship? Michael Byers, who holds the Canada
Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the
University of British Columbia, says Canada over the years has moved
further away from the US, particularly over culture war issues from guns
to gay marriage. Today that is no clearer than at the top, where Trudeau
has come to symbolize the liberal world order and Trump the populism
nipping at its edges. He says those trends continue -- but they aren't
necessarily anti-American in nature, and the vast majority of Canadians
distinguish between the administration and the American population.
"[[Canadians are very]{.underline} **[concerned]{.underline}** [by how
\[Trump\] has turned a very positive bi-national relationship **into a
hard-nose bargaining game**]{.underline},]{.mark}" Mr. Byers says.
"Trump will cause a greater degree of divergence, and that certainly has
Canadians pulling together. Not against the United States, but against
the Trump administration." Not all sound such an optimistic note for the
future of the relationship. In a commentary in The Globe and Mail, Laura
Dawson, the director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in
Washington, recalls the words of former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien
days after 9/11, when he declared that Canada would stand behind the US
because the friendship has no limit. "Or does it?" she asks in the
piece. "Looking back on Sept. 14, 2001, I wonder whether Canadians will
ever again feel that same sense of solidarity with the United States.
Will our flags ever overlap as proudly and easily as they did then?"
Bottom of Form Mr. Adams, of the Environics Institute, reaches back even
further, to the oft-cited words of former President John F. Kennedy, who
defined the Canadian-American alliance in Ottawa in 1961: "Geography has
made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us
partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so
joined together, let no man put asunder. What unites us is far greater
than what divides us." Many Canadians hope Kennedy's words will endure
the political disruption from Washington nearly 60 years later. But
today they feel less an ally and more like "the little sister," as Adams
puts it. "We'll feel badly, we might cry, but I don't know what we can
do. Our only authority is moral authority."

The United States and Canada are engaged in bilateral trade talks
related to U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods and Canadian retaliatory
tariffs. The two countries, along with Mexico, also are scheduled to
engage in a review of USMCA in July 2026. Congress may consider whether
to exercise its legislative prerogatives related to the U.S.-Canada

According to Statistics Canada data for [[2024, Canada exported 76% of

States]{.underline}.]{.mark} As of 2023 (the latest data available from
the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and Statistics Canada), the United
States was the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) by
stock in Canada (C\$618.2 billion/about \$450.4 billion), and Canada was
the third-largest source of U.S. FDI (\$671.7 billion). [[Canada has

oil, natural gas, and electricity.]{.underline}]{.mark} Canada\'s share
of U.S. crude oil imports by quantity increased from 38% (1.02 billion

Tariffs on Canadian Imports

In 2025, President Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian goods under the
[International Emergency Economic Powers
Act](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12533) (IEEPA, [50 U.S.C.
§§1701](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2011-title50/USCODE-2011-title50-chap35-sec1701)
et seq.) and [Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of
1962](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13006) ([19 U.S.C.
§1862](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2015-title19/USCODE-2015-title19-chap7-subchapII-partIV-sec1862),
as amended). Canadian imports under USMCA are largely exempt from such
tariffs. According to 2024 U.S. Census Bureau data, about 38% of U.S.
imports from Canada by value entered the United States under USMCA.
[Some
analysts](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/big-chunk-of-north-american-trade-remains-exposed-to-tariffs-c13b4674)
note that this could be because certain goods had no or low tariffs,
regardless of whether they were imported under a free trade agreement.
In such cases, importers may have chosen not to certify whether a
Canadian import met USMCA rules.

From March 2025, President [[Trump imposed 25% tariffs on most Canadian
imports]{.underline}]{.mark} (10% on energy and potash imports) under
IEEPA, citing an emergency related to illicit fentanyl and other drug
trafficking at the border with Canada. Canadian goods entering the
United States under USMCA are exempt from these tariffs. In July 2025,
President Trump announced that the U.S. tariff rate on Canadian goods
would increase to 35% on August 1. White House officials reportedly
stated that the exemption for USMCA-compliant goods would continue.

## Climate Change

### 2nc---INT Coop K2 Solve Climate Change

**International coop is key to solve Climate Change**

**Sustainability Directory '24** \[Sustainability Directory, "Why is
international cooperation important in the Arctic?", Climate
Sustainability Directory, 2024,
https://climate.sustainability-directory.com/question/why-is-international-cooperation-important-in-the-arctic/\]

The Arctic, a realm of ice and wonder, is undergoing rapid
transformation. This region, once perceived as remote and isolated, is
now at the forefront of global attention. Understanding why
international cooperation is paramount in the Arctic begins with
recognizing its unique and interconnected nature. It is not just about
polar bears or melting ice; it is about global climate stability, the
well-being of Arctic communities, and the future of our planet.

Firstly, the Arctic is a critical regulator of the Earth's climate. The
vast ice sheets and glaciers reflect solar radiation back into space,
helping to keep the planet cool. [Changes in the Arctic, such as ice
melt, directly impact global sea levels and weather
patterns.]{.underline}

[**No single nation can address the scale of climate change affecting
the Arctic; it requires a concerted, international effort to mitigate
emissions and adapt to the changes already underway**.]{.underline} The
interconnectedness of [the climate system necessitates a collaborative
approach.]{.underline}

Secondly, the Arctic is home to diverse ecosystems and unique
biodiversity. From polar bears and walruses to migratory birds and fish
stocks, the Arctic's flora and fauna are adapted to extreme conditions
and are particularly vulnerable to climate change and human activities[.
Protecting this fragile environment requires international agreements on
conservation, sustainable resource management, and pollution
control.]{.underline}

Migratory species, in particular, transcend national borders, making
[cooperative conservation efforts essential. The Arctic's ecological
integrity is a shared responsibility.]{.underline}

Thirdly, the Arctic is inhabited by Indigenous Peoples with distinct
cultures and traditional ways of life deeply connected to the land and
sea. Climate change and increased human activities pose significant
threats to their livelihoods, food security, and cultural heritage.
[International cooperation is vital to ensure their rights are
respected, their voices are heard in decision-making processes, and
their traditional knowledge is integrated into Arctic policies.
Supporting the resilience and self-determination of Arctic Indigenous
communities is a moral imperative and a crucial aspect of sustainable
Arctic governance.]{.underline}

Finally, the Arctic is increasingly becoming a region of geopolitical
significance. As sea ice retreats, new shipping routes are opening up,
and access to natural resources becomes more feasible. This has led to
increased interest from Arctic and non-Arctic nations alike.

Without international cooperation, there is a risk of competition and
conflict over resources and maritime space, potentially destabilizing
the region and hindering sustainable development. Cooperative governance
frameworks, such as the [**Arctic Council, are essential for managing
these geopolitical dynamics** and **promoting peaceful and sustainable
development in the Arctic.**]{.underline}

Building upon the foundational understanding of the Arctic's global
significance, we can explore the complex layers of necessity driving
international cooperation in this rapidly changing region. The
imperative extends beyond basic environmental concerns, encompassing
intricate geopolitical, economic, and ethical dimensions. To truly grasp
the importance of collaborative action, one must consider the
interconnected challenges and opportunities that define the Arctic
today.

The Arctic's role as a climate change amplifier necessitates a globally
coordinated response. The phenomenon of Arctic amplification, where the
Arctic warms at a rate two to three times faster than the global
average, accelerates global warming trends. [Melting permafrost releases
potent greenhouse gases like methane, further exacerbating climate
change.]{.underline} The instability of Arctic ice sheets contributes
significantly to sea-level rise, threatening coastal communities
worldwide.

Addressing these interconnected climate feedback loops requires
international scientific collaboration, data sharing, and joint
mitigation strategies. The Arctic's climate vulnerability is a global
climate vulnerability.

Furthermore, the management of Arctic resources presents a complex web
of shared interests and potential conflicts. While the Arctic holds vast
reserves of oil, gas, and minerals, their extraction poses significant
environmental risks in a fragile ecosystem. Sustainable resource
development requires international agreements on environmental
standards, shipping regulations, and benefit-sharing mechanisms,
particularly involving Arctic Indigenous communities.

[The opening of Arctic shipping routes, such as the Northern Sea Route,
presents both economic opportunities and environmental challenges,
requiring international cooperation on maritime safety, search and
rescue, and pollution prevention]{.underline}. Balancing economic
development with environmental protection in the Arctic necessitates a
collaborative and responsible approach.

The protection of Arctic biodiversity demands transboundary conservation
efforts. [Many Arctic species migrate across national borders, relying
on habitats spanning multiple countries. Effective conservation
strategies require **international agreements** on protected areas,
wildlife management, and combating illegal wildlife trade.]{.underline}
Pollution, including persistent organic pollutants and plastic debris,
travels long distances and accumulates in the Arctic food web, impacting
both wildlife and human health.

[International cooperation is essential to address pollution sources
both within and outside the Arctic region. Preserving the Arctic's
unique biodiversity is a shared global ecological
responsibility.]{.underline}

Considering the human dimension, [international cooperation is crucial
for promoting the well-being and rights of Arctic residents,
particularly Indigenous Peoples.]{.underline} Climate change and
globalization are impacting Arctic cultures and traditional livelihoods.
International forums, such as the Arctic Council and the United Nations,
provide platforms for dialogue, knowledge sharing, and co-management
approaches involving Arctic Indigenous representatives.

Addressing social and economic disparities in Arctic communities
requires international collaboration on sustainable development
initiatives, education, healthcare, and cultural preservation.
Supporting the resilience and self-determination of Arctic populations
is a matter of social justice and ethical responsibility.

In the geopolitical landscape, international cooperation serves as a
vital mechanism for maintaining peace and stability in the Arctic. [The
Arctic Council, despite its limitations, has been instrumental in
fostering dialogue and cooperation among Arctic states on various
issues, from environmental protection to search and rescue.]{.underline}
International law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS), provides a framework for managing maritime boundaries
and activities in the Arctic Ocean.

**Unilateral geoengineering collapses global legitimacy and provokes
international backlash**

**Horton '18** \[Jesse L. Reynolds, Andy Parker, and Joshua B. Horton,
"The Problem of Policy Lock-in in Solar Geoengineering Governance,"
Stanford Law School, May 2018,
https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/horton.pdf\]

Conventional concerns about the threat of unilateral geoengineering
typically run as now described. At some point in the decades to come, in
a world of accelerating climate change and continuing failure to
significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Country A decides
that its interests would best be served by implementing a climate
intervention strategy (in the present case, SAI). This decision may be
driven by any number of developments: altered precipitation patterns,
rising sea level, shifting disease vectors, disruptions to agriculture,
desertification, etc.

 

Unable to gain international support for the deployment of SAI, Country
A deploys the technology on a unilateral basis, flouting the consensus
among states, materially affecting the global climate system, adversely
impacting particular states and regions, offending those who view
climate intervention as "unnatural"---in other words, seizing control of
the global "thermostat."6 Put simply, for Country A, the potential costs
of defying international opinion are outweighed by the benefits of
unilateral geoengineering.

[ ]{.underline}

[Unilateral deployment by Country A subsequently results in global
disapprobation and triggers an international response in the form of
sanctions, a trade war, or worse.]{.underline} Variations of this
scenario have been advanced most prominently by members of the policy
community, especially foreign policy experts. 7 For example, Victor et
al. write:

 

Geoengineering is an option at the disposal of any reasonably advanced
nation. A single country could deploy geoengineering systems from its
own territory without consulting the rest of the planet. Geoengineers
keen to alter their own country's climate might not assess or even care
about the dangers their actions could create for climates, ecosystems,
and economies elsewhere[. A unilateral geoengineering project could
impose costs on other countries, such as changes in precipitation
patterns and river flows or adverse impacts on agriculture, marine,
fishing, and tourism.]{.underline} At some point in the near future, it
is conceivable that a nation that has not done enough to confront
climate change will conclude that global warming has become so harmful
to interests that it should unilaterally engage in geoengineering.

 

[Unilateral action would create a crisis of legitimacy that could make
it especially difficult to manage geoengineering schemes once they are
under way]{.underline}.8 Policymakers and analysts worry about the
effects of unilateral deployment on international peace and stability.
[Unilateral geoengineering is viewed as a challenge to the international
order, in terms of both legitimacy and security, in a way reminiscent of
nuclear proliferation. 9 Climate scientists have also noted concerns
about unilateral geoengineering.]{.underline}  For instance, Lawrence
states: It is easy to imagine a future scenario in which certain nations
begin to undertake largescale geoengineering efforts on their own. It is
not uncommon for nations to act unilaterally in what they perceive as
their own best interests, regardless of any international outcry about
the consequences for the rest of the world.

## Democracy

### 2nc---Card for Democracy Advt CP

#### Democracy-led relations facilitates better policy-making than authoritarianism

Ottawa as a professor with the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs. Jeremy Wallace is a professor at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He is a Professor of
China Studies. (Nomi Claire Lazar and Jeremy Wallace, "Resisting the

But even if we could install the dictator of our choice, [what guarantee
would there be that this dictator could keep power]{.underline}? A
moment later, people with other ideas of what humanity desperately needs
would be at work to [seize that power]{.underline}. [**[Without]{.mark}
constitutional [democracy]{.mark}** as a buffer[, contests over power
become]{.mark} **literally [existential]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Democracy grasps that (to paraphrase what the poet Rainer Maria Rilke
said about feelings) ["no power is final."]{.underline}
Liber[al-[democratic systems exist to keep the ongoing struggle for
power **peaceful and lawful** rather than **bloody and
chaotic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

No good evidence suggests that regimes with authoritarian
characteristics are better at climate response --- and even if they are,
climate sirens neglect at our common peril the importance of
constitutional democracies as managers of political temporality:
[[Democracies facilitate politics as a continuing process. There is
always the next election]{.mark}, the next policy round, judicial review
and appeal, more time. Politics, power, and policy keep moving, lowering
the stakes of competing visions of the good.]{.underline}

[[Authoritarians aspire to be the ultimate governmen]{.mark}t, the last
power, so they barricade themselves: controlling information flows,
silencing not only enemies but even supporters. Even where these methods
work and secure the regime, [they insulate leaders from feedback that is
critical]{.mark} (in both senses). **[Policies are adopted in ignorance
and without sufficient scrutiny, and they fail]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Where these security measures do not work, [we find a negative spiral of
competing claims of ultimacy.]{.underline} Political contestation over
climate policy will not stop with the achievement of concentrated power.
It will just grow bloodier. Any politics of ultimacy is ultimately a
politics of death.

## Maritime Escalation

### 1nc---Maritime Escalation

#### CP Text: The United States Federal Government should increase and maintain regular Freedom of Navigation patrols through contested waterways in the South China Sea and the Persian Gulf. 

#### Freedom of Navigation Ops solve maritime escalation --- [signals resolve and deters aggression]{.underline} 

**Xiaobo Liu 19**, (Captain Liu Xiaobo (Ret.) is Director of the Marine
Study Center at the Grandview Institution, Beijing. He was previously an
associate research fellow and director of the World Navy Research
Center, National Institute for South China Sea Studies. His research
focuses on national maritime security policy, sea power, and the Law of

navigation officer aboard the PLAN destroyer Harbin and later as a
research associate in the Naval Research Institute.
https://amti.csis.org/how-china-can-resolve-fonop-deadlock/) VW

Since 2017, [the U.S. Navy has performed]{.underline} freedom of
navigation operations ([FONOPs) in the South China Sea
routinely]{.underline}, on a basis of about every two months. In
response to each operation, [the]{.underline} People's Liberation Army
Navy ([PLAN]{.underline}) [customarily dispatches air and surface
units]{.underline} to carry out verification and identification, and to
warn the U.S. warships to steer away. Though now routine, these
exercises continue to spark fierce debate in the academic circles and
media of both countries. [Chinese observers]{.underline} repeat official
diplomatic statements, deny the legality of the operations, and
[overwhelmingly denounce the U.S. actions]{.underline}, while seldom
giving voice to feasible ways of resolving the dispute. The U.S. [FONOP
program in the South China Sea has turned into a political
battlefield]{.underline} with a legal façade between the two nations. It
is not realistic for China to ask the United States to abandon its
FONOPs, and it is just as unrealistic for the United States to ask China
to simply drop its excessive maritime claims. [The three policy options
offered to China]{.underline} in this analysis, grounded in a realist
perspective, [could help define a path for escaping the
deadlock.]{.underline}

**[1. Maintaining the status quo: if U.S. warships continue to perform
FONOPs routinely, and China continues to respond in the same way, the
United States will win out.]{.underline}**

Thus far[, U.S. FONOPs]{.underline} [in the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea have always occurred at times and
locations decided unilaterally, giving Washington the upper hand over
Beijing. By sticking to its routine, [the United States asserts its
right to free navigation]{.underline} in the South China Sea in direct
opposition to the Law of the People's Republic of China on the
Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone and the Declaration of the
Government of the People's Republic of China on the Baselines of the
Territorial Sea, and in so doing undermines the authority of the Chinese
government on its maritime rights of the South China Sea. By maintaining
this course of action over time, the United States shapes international
custom and consensus, [strengthening international recognition of its
freedom of navigation]{.underline} concept (which differs from that of
China in regard to sovereignty, jurisdiction and historical rights).

Every time the United States engages in a FONOP, the Chinese side waits
to react. Each U.S. FONOP is usually followed by representations and
protests lodged repeatedly by Chinese spokespersons in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Southern
Theater, reiterating China's policy of taking necessary measures to
defend national sovereignty and security. However, these statements do
nothing to stop the next FONOP. The Chinese side also sends warships and
military aircraft, with a stated goal of verifying and warning off the
U.S. warships. But according to reports from media aboard the U.S.
ships, the Chinese warships and military aircraft only follow the U.S.
ships and monitor them from a safe distance, calling from time to time
via radio to warn them off to no effect. China has largely stuck to this
course of action for more than three years and such a response has
failed entirely at stopping U.S. FONOPs. It stands to reason that if
China continues this style of response, [further FONOPs will continue to
undermine China's national credibility.]{.underline}

On September 30, 2018, the USS Decatur was forced to change course
during a FONOP near Nanxun Reefs (Gaven Reefs), when the PLAN destroyer
Lanzhou tried to intercept the U.S. destroyer. This is probably the only
actual interception made by China's navy on a FONOP since 2015. However,
neither of the subsequent statements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
or the Ministry of National Defense said anything about the interception
attempt or the forced course correction, giving up the opportunity to
publicize what could be called a successful eviction. The low profile
adopted by Beijing may be a clue that top Chinese officials did not
approve the action, or that they are worried about its negative impact.
In a Chinese military command system that emphasizes highly centralized
and unified leadership, it is hard to imagine seeing another such
interception by sea/air operating forces (if that was indeed the
situation).

**[2. Responding harshly: even if China meets U.S. FONOPs with force
including dangerous approaches, collisions, or even a minor conflict, it
is unlikely to stop FONOPs]{.underline}**.

If China take a tough line, will it force the United States to stop
FONOPs? This ultimately comes down to a comparison between the military
might of China and the United States, and whether the United States has
sufficient confidence in a military confrontation with China in the
South China Sea.

Based on the current U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region,
the United States is unlikely to make concessions to Chinese military
pressure. As far as FONOPs go, the United States has always pursued an
unforgiving policy backed by military strength, and has never been
intimidated by an adversary into halting FONOPs. In the 1980s, [during
the Cold War, even though the Soviet Navy dominated in some areas, the
U.S. Navy insisted on carrying out FONOPs]{.underline} in the Soviet
Union's territorial seas. Despite intentionally colliding with U.S.
ships exercising innocent passage in the Black Sea in February 1988, the
[Soviet Union ultimately yielded to the U.S.]{.underline} position that
innocent passage does not require approval from the coastal state.
Considering the relative strength of Chinese and U.S. forces today, [it
is hard to believe that a tough response from China would be any more
effective in forcing the United States to stop FONOPs.]{.underline}

The global and longstanding practice of [FONOPs]{.underline} by the
United States over the past three decades [also makes it less likely to
be deterred from operations in the South China Sea.]{.underline} Since
1991, the United States has challenged the excessive maritime claims of
nearly 60 countries around the world, and convinced at least nine
countries and areas to revise domestic legislation on innocent passage,
[including the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Latvia, Sweden, Denmark,
Indonesia, Finland, and Chinese Taiwan.]{.underline}

Moreover, though the two countries have agreed on avoiding incidents and
conflict in the air and at sea, this does not mean that the two nuclear
power are not prepared for small-scale conflicts. [If China takes tough
measures]{.underline} to intercept or collide with U.S. warships, [the
United States is less likely to suffer]{.underline} in potential air and
sea small-scale conflicts [because of its military
superiority]{.underline} in the region. Even in a "tie" scenario, the
heightened tensions in the South China Sea would create opportunities
for the United States and its allies to reinforce their presence in the
region. As a result, China would lose relative strength in the security
order of the South China Sea.

**[3. To seek mutual compromise: China and the United States can
maximize common gain by consulting on, and compromising mutually over,
maritime laws relevant to freedom of navigation.]{.underline}**

At the technical level, U.S. FONOPs in the South China Sea mainly target
China's excessive maritime claims, which include:

a\) excessive straight baselines;

b\) requiring warships to obtain prior approval before entering a
territorial sea;

c\) security control in the contiguous zone;

d\) jurisdiction over foreign military activities in the exclusive
economic zone, including surveillance and reconnaissance;

e\) jurisdiction over the airspace above the exclusive economic zone;
and

f\) the artificial islands in Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands), and
their claimed territorial seas.

Setting aside the last point, which China considers a matter of
territorial sovereignty, the disputes stem from different understanding
and interpretations of the rules of contemporary international law of
the sea. These divergences are rooted in the different perceptions of
ocean values between China, a traditional continental country, and the
United States, a country with a longstanding connection to its two
adjacent oceans. But as China's increasing global influence, driven by
projects like the Belt and Road Initiative, will benefit from
coordinated development of land and sea, [Beijing may realize the
benefits accrued]{.underline} to its long-term maritime interests from
the freedom of navigation concept. [That may allow some room for China
and the United States to negotiate on the disputes over
FONOPs.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Compared with China's other maritime disputes, which involve territorial
sovereignty and maritime delimitation in the Yellow Sea, the East China
Sea, and the South China Sea, the issue underpinning disputes over
freedom of navigation is more of a theoretical debate. Rather than
centering on irreconcilable claims of ownership that run against China's
core interests of national unity, territorial integrity and development,
the dispute is instead one of how the sea should be utilized and how it
should be governed. There is space for consultation between China and
the United States here. [As China's relative strength]{.underline}
vis-à-vis its neighbors grows in the South China Sea, [maintaining
stability is a top priority.]{.underline} Keeping a low profile and
avoiding conflict between China and the United States in the South China
Sea should be China's long-term policy. Resolving divergent opinions
over freedom of navigation through careful negotiation, and amending
domestic laws and policies on innocent passage or military use of the
EEZ, while seeming on their face to be concessions, would indeed be a
path of major progress toward oceanic power for China.

Next week, the Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing analyzing
the impact of House-passed legislation that would eliminate the vast
majority of the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA's) \$80 billion
investment in rebuilding the federal tax system. It is well-established
that more than [[a decade of]{.mark} deep IRS [funding
cuts]{.mark}]{.underline} have weakened the tax system and [hindered
revenue collection]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} that the [IRA's
investment will]{.underline} reduce the deficit by at least \$100
billion through [increase]{.underline}d [enforcement]{.underline}
focused on "high-income and high-wealth individuals, complex
partnerships, and large corporations that are not paying the taxes they
owe." That is reason enough to reject the misguided approach in the
House-passed bill. The hearing will also focus, however, on a
less-understood but crucial aspect of IRS funding: "analyzing the impact
on federal law enforcement." This post briefly explains why
[reversing]{.underline} the IRA's investment in the tax system [would
[have serious consequences for the **detection and prevention**
of]{.mark} other financial [crimes]{.mark} that are often deeply
intertwined with tax evasion and other forms of tax non-compliance,
**[including]{.mark} corruption** and bribery, [**terrorist
financing**,]{.mark} fraud, and **money laundering.**]{.underline}

The tools that the IRS uses to uncover tax evasion are often useful for
revealing other financial crimes. [[There is a **longstanding** and
mutually reinforcing **interaction between** the **anti-money
laundering**/**countering** financial **terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(AML/CFT) regime and domestic and international tax administration, as
we discussed in our initial comment on rulemaking for the 2019 Corporate
Transparency Act (CTA), which created a beneficial ownership reporting
regime to counter financial crimes including tax evasion. Both require
information about who actually owns different entities such as
partnerships and trusts, i.e. their "beneficial ownership," as well as
the beneficial ownership of other arrangements and accounts. The reason
is simple: entities have the capacity to conceal the identity of the
people who use them to commit crimes. AML/CFT regimes and tax
administration have established overlapping and mutually enforced
systems to gather, organize, protect, and share beneficial ownership
information.

[The IRS also directly investigates financial crimes with links to tax
fraud]{.underline}. As we noted in another comment on proposed CTA
rules, the close relationship between tax enforcement and the AML/CFT
regime has led to the Treasury Secretary to delegate criminal
enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act to the IRS Criminal Investigation
division (IRS-CI). In addition to IRS-CI's primary charge to investigate
criminal tax fraud, the division spent over 15 percent of its time in
2021 and 2022 investigating related non-tax financial crimes. That time
has generated a substantial return: [IRS-CI uncovered \$35 billion in
non-tax financial crimes]{.underline} those years [in addition to about
\$8 billion in tax fraud]{.underline}. The returns may have been even
higher if not for the 25% decline in its staffing since 2010 due to
budget cuts, which IRS-CI states has had a "material impact on the
ability of the CI enforcement team to pursue enforcement actions."

Furthermore, both tax administration and the work of IRS-CI directly
impact illicit finance investigations with significant national security
interests, as we've written at Just Security. Due to IRS-CI's
"unparalleled experience in tracking how financial assets change hands,"
it was named as a member of Task Force KleptoCapture, the multi-agency
effort to track down the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. The
task force has successfully seized over \$500 million in assets and used
some of these proceeds to directly fund US interests in Ukraine, in
addition to training Ukrainian law enforcement to trace cryptocurrency
transactions supporting the Russian war effort. [[The ability to]{.mark}
enforce economic sanctions, in addition to [root]{.mark}ing [out
corruption and terrorist funding]{.mark} more generally, [is intended to
**cut off lifelines**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[that **enable
