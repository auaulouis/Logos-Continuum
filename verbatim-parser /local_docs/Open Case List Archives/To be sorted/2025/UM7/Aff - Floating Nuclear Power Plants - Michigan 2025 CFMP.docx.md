7. Conclusions and international policy implications

[The global **imperative** to **decarbonize** has brought the **maritime
industry** into sharp focus due to its significant impact on greenhouse
gas emissions]{.underline}. [The adoption of [**nuclear energy** in
maritime]{.mark}]{.underline} and offshore [[applications represents an
innovative **frontier**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the quest for
sustainable solutions. [**[China]{.mark}** recognizes the **urgency** of
emissions reduction]{.underline} within its maritime industry [and [has
**leveraged** its]{.mark} nuclear energy [**expertise** to lead in
applying]{.mark} this [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[to]{.mark}
reduce]{.underline} carbon [emissions in]{.underline} shipping,
[**[offshore op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and other
maritime activities. Through a series of strategic plans and
regulations, [China has [demonstrated its **commitment** to]{.mark}
promoting the [development of **nuclear marine**]{.mark} propulsion
**[programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, despite notable progress in
China\'s nuclear energy adoption in these domains, significant
challenges persist. This research undertakes an in-depth examination of
China\'s legal and policy initiatives aimed at advancing nuclear energy
adoption in maritime and offshore contexts. [China\'s **endeavors** to
advance nuclear marine propulsion programs]{.underline}, [coupled with
the **challenges** in its legal and policy **framework**]{.underline},
[may give rise to **international policy implications** spanning
multiple **vital areas**]{.underline}.

7.1. Impacts on shaping international regulations for nuclear marine
propulsion equipment

As highlighted earlier, the numerous deficiencies within China\'s legal
and policy framework pose substantial difficulties to the creation of a
mature regulatory structure. This situation leaves China grappling with
challenges in effectively overseeing the development of nuclear marine
propulsion equipment and addressing their potential radioactive marine
pollution. Therefore, establishing an effective regulatory framework to
ensure the nuclear safety and navigational safety and prevent
radioactive marine pollution for nuclear marine propulsion equipment
within China becomes a matter of importance.

However, the unilateral establishment of a domestic regulatory framework
for nuclear marine propulsion equipment is fraught with several
problems. First, the safety and environmental regulation of the
equipment in international waters is not solely a matter of concern for
the deployment state, they also hold significance for neighboring
coastal states and the international community. The imposition of
equipment safety standards without international consensus may struggle
to strike a balance between fostering the progression of the marine
nuclear energy sector and safeguarding the marine environment for the
common good. Second, the regulation of nuclear marine propulsion
equipment presents a host of intricate issues that cannot be adequately
addressed by domestic legislation alone. For instance, matters such as
the navigation of NPVs and FNPPs through disputed waters, the granting
of port access to nuclear-powered equipment involved in accidents, and
the response to nuclear incidents on the high seas necessitate
international mechanisms for coordination and resolution. Third, in the
absence of globally recognized regulatory guidelines, unilateral
regulatory measures could potentially trigger conflicts with the
maritime law enforcement practices of other states. This may also result
in a fragmented governance landscape for nuclear-powered vessels and
platforms engaged in international voyages.

Besides China, [**[many countries]{.mark}** have been actively
[support]{.mark}ing the [development of]{.mark} nuclear [marine]{.mark}
propulsion [equipment]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years. For example,
[the **US** **[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f **[E]{.mark}**nergy
[funded]{.mark} a **[research]{.mark} initiative** [on **FNPPs**]{.mark}
in 2022]{.underline} (Nuclear Engineering International, 2022). [The
American **Bureau of Shipping** has launched a landmark **research
project** on the use of nuclear propulsion in commercial
vessels]{.underline} because of nuclear energy\'s carbon-free profile in
2022 (NuclearNewswire, 2022). In 2007, [[**Russia** initiated]{.mark}
the construction of [its **FNPP**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the **Akademik
Lomonosov**]{.underline}, [with the platform **commencing** operations
[in **2019**]{.mark}]{.underline} (World Nuclear News, 2019). [With
[increasing number of countries]{.mark} fostering the development of
nuclear marine propulsion programs]{.underline}, [they are likely to
[face **challenges**]{.mark} similar to those **encountered** by
**China**]{.underline}, [particularly [in]{.mark} the areas of
[**legal** and **regulatory frameworks**]{.mark}]{.underline} (IAEA,
2013). Issues [[such as]{.underline}]{.mark} **[nuclear
[liability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[environmental
protection]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[safety]{.mark}**
protocols]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the [**management** of
**cross-border**]{.mark} maritime **nuclear [activities]{.mark}** will
require coordinated **international efforts**]{.underline}. The need for
establishing an international regulatory framework has grown
significantly in importance.

While the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships (MARPOL) and the International Convention for Safety of Life at
Sea (SOLAS) currently prescribe certain regulatory requirements
regarding the safe operation of NPVs, they fall short in addressing
comprehensive regulations for other categories of nuclear marine
propulsion equipment, such as FNPPs and nuclear-powered unmanned
underwater vehicles (Wang et al., 2023b). Furthermore, Japan\'s recent
discharge of contaminated nuclear wastewater underscored the
shortcomings in the existing international framework governing
radioactive marine pollution (Xu et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2022; Liu
and Hoskin, 2023). Therefore, it is crucial to consider the creation of
a more effective international regulatory framework aimed at fostering
collaboration among nations in formulating comprehensive standards and
regulations governing the development, deployment, and operation of
nuclear marine propulsion equipment. To prevent disorderly development
and mitigate international conflicts, it is advisable for the
international regulatory framework to address the following critical
considerations for nuclear marine propulsion equipment: (1) Safety
standards and requirements covering their equipment design, radiation
control, treatment and storage of nuclear waste, permissible standard
for thermal water discharge, crew member training and certification,
classification society inspection for seaworthiness, refueling safety,
and security safeguards against terrorism; (2) International cooperation
mechanisms covering emergency response protocols for maritime nuclear
incidents, joint maritime search and rescue operations, and the sharing
of information related to radiation monitoring; and (3) International
coordination mechanisms covering these equipment\'s port access,
navigation in territorial water, voyage in the exclusive economic zone,
reasonable delineation of safety zone surrounding the equipment, and
port state control and coastal state control (Handrlica, 2022).

7.2. Impacts on regional geopolitics and freedom of navigation

While nuclear energy technology continues to advance with enhanced
safety measures and reduced accident probabilities, [**[nuclear
incidents]{.mark}** once **occur**red may still [have profound
**consequences**]{.mark} on both **human health** and the
**environment**]{.underline}. Consequently, [concerns persist regarding
the deployment and operation of nuclear marine propulsion equipment at
sea]{.underline}. This concern has been particularly heightened since
the Fukushima nuclear disaster. [Given these circumstances]{.underline},
[China\'s rigorous development of nuclear marine propulsion
equipment]{.underline}, guided by legal and policy frameworks, [has the
possibility to generate **geopolitical tensions** or may even
**exacerbate** existing **navigation disputes** in **disputed** maritime
**regions**]{.underline} (Melchiorre, 2022).

For instance, [China\'s [**FNPP** development]{.mark}]{.underline} aims
to meet remote water supply and energy needs while supporting offshore
oil and gas operations in the South China Sea and East China Sea (China
Nuclear Energy Association, 2016; China Energy News, 2017). However,
these areas are [[marked by **sovereignty**]{.mark} and **jurisdiction
[conflicts]{.mark}** involving China and neighboring maritime
nations]{.underline}. [Deploying and **[navigating FNPPs]{.mark}** in
these waters [provokes **discontent**]{.mark}, especially [among
**coastal neighbors**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nguyen, 2018). [Analysts
often link FNPPs to China\'s broader regional strategy and military
actions]{.underline}, [suggesting that]{.underline} their [deployment
may not only bolster China\'s control but also contribute to regional
militarization]{.underline} by enhancing the logistical capabilities of
its navy (Deemer et al., 2023).

#### 1\-\--[UNAPPLICABILITY]{.underline}. Lack of [Arctic-specific]{.underline} frameworks ensures [failure]{.underline}.

The [legal [framework]{.mark} that governs the use [of
nuclear]{.mark}-powered [vessels]{.mark}]{.underline} and platforms in
the Arctic region [mainly [consists of]{.mark} the
**[UNCLOS]{.mark}**]{.underline}, conventions that governs maritime
transport, and conventions concerning nuclear safety and liabilities.
**[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [regulatory [**challenges**
arise]{.mark} not only from each **individual** legal regime but also
from their **interaction**]{.underline}. While UNCLOS provides a
framework for safeguarding the marine environment, it [falls short in
establishing **specific** regulatory **measures** to address nuclear
pollution]{.underline} in the ocean. **[[UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}**
focuses on regulating NPVs' right of innocent passage through coastal
states' territorial sea (UNCLOS 1982, Articles 22, 23). However, it
[[does not]{.mark} adequately [regulate]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[[vessels]{.mark} in other maritime zones **[outside]{.mark}** of [the
**territorial sea**]{.mark}, [especially in]{.mark} terms of
environmental safety and **[radiative pollution]{.mark}**
control]{.underline}.

The legal framework governing [maritime [transport]{.mark}]{.underline}
may [[encounter **challenges**]{.mark} in dealing with problems in the
Arctic due to the region's distinct **geography** and
**climate**]{.underline}. Most [**[convention]{.mark}**s' **technical
[standards]{.mark}** face obstacles in application since
they]{.underline} often [[**fail** to **account** for]{.mark}
these]{.underline} [[**unique** conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
instance, the [[**absence** of **collision avoidance**]{.mark}
regulations for "ice-covered areas" and the lack of a standardized
training program for vessels' crew in ice-covered areas impede the
effective implementation of]{.underline} the [International Convention
on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at
Sea]{.underline} *and the International Convention on Standards of
Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers* in Arctic
shipping routes. The *International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships* (**[[MARPOL]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[does not
regulate radioactive discharges]{.mark} from NPVs]{.underline}. Although
the 1974 *International Convention for the Safety of Life at
Sea* (**[[SOLAS]{.underline}]{.mark}** Convention) introduces a special
chapter setting safety standards for NPVs, it largely [[relies
on]{.mark} the flag **[state]{.mark}**s to implement these safety
**[requirements]{.mark}** and the problem of "[**flag** of
**convenience**]{.mark}" can [render]{.mark} such **[regulation
ineffective]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Wang et al. 2023b).
The *International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters* does not
address specific issues related to NPVs operating in polar regions. [At
present, there are **[no]{.mark} international [regimes]{.mark}** [or
**organizations**]{.mark} in place that are capable of sufficiently
**[regulat]{.mark}**ing the **[nuclear propulsion]{.mark}** and
adequately overseeing the **disposal** of radioactive **waste** in the
high seas in the central Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.

When it comes to the legal framework for regulating nuclear safety, the
[current conventions face several challenges in governing civilian
nuclear vessels and nuclear power platforms in the Arctic
region]{.underline}. For example, while the *Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material* offers a [framework for [safeguarding
**nuclear materials**]{.mark}]{.underline} used for peaceful purposes
during international transportation, it [[only covers]{.mark} the period
"**beginning** with the [**departure** from]{.mark} a [facility]{.mark}
of the shipper in that State and ending with the **arrival** at a
facility of the receiver within the State of ultimate
destination]{.underline}" (Amendment to the Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material 2021, Article 1). Therefore, the
[utilization of nuclear power for maritime propulsion]{.underline}
purposes [may not fall under the **purview** of this
**definition**]{.underline} if it is strictly interpreted.
The [[**Convention** on **Nuclear Safety** only applies
to]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[land]{.mark}-based** civil **n**uclear
**p**ower **p**lant**s**]{.underline}" and does not cover naval reactors
or reactors used for maritime propulsion purposes (Convention on Nuclear
Safety 1994, Article 2). The [Convention on [Early Notification]{.mark}
of Nuclear Accident requires member states to provide prompt and
detailed notification]{.underline} to other countries and international
organizations in the event [of nuclear accidents]{.underline}. [However,
the convention [focuses on]{.mark} the occurrence or
**[likelihood]{.mark}** of a release]{.underline} of radioactive
material that could affect another State, [[rather than]{.mark} on the
**[prevention]{.mark}** or **reduction** [of]{.mark} such a
**[release]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It does not require adequate safety
measures or precautions to avoid or minimize the risk of accidents of
transboundary radiological significance. The *Joint Convention on the
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the* [Safety of Radiation [Waste
Management does not cover]{.mark}]{.underline} those "[spent fuel held
at reprocessing facilities as part of a reprocessing
activity]{.underline}." This [implies that the convention's regulatory
framework may **not** adequately cover **NPVs** that use
**[Gen]{.mark}**eration **[IV]{.mark}** nuclear
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [and **reprocess** spent
**fuel**]{.underline}, if they are developed in the future (Locatelli et

Uncertainties in nuclear liability and compensation regimes

The [fragility and significance of the ecosystems in the Arctic make
nuclear pollution a serious]{.underline} cause for [concern]{.underline}
in the region. NPVs including icebreakers and [FNPPs are one of the
sources of nuclear pollution]{.underline} in the Arctic. These [vessels
generate a variety of waste products, including nuclear waste and other
hazardous materials, which can have serious environmental
consequences]{.underline} if not managed properly (Ouyang et al. 2019).
[[In the **event** of an **accident**]{.underline}]{.mark} or a spill,
the [release of **radioactive material** into the **Arctic
waters**]{.underline} could [have significant **impacts** on the
**ecosystem** and the **health** of **local communities**]{.underline}
(Johannsdottir and Cook 2019). Therefore, the use of nuclear power
carries inherent risks, and there is a need for a liability and
compensation regime that ensures that victims of nuclear incidents are
adequately compensated. However, the issue of [[transboundary
**liability**]{.underline}]{.mark} and compensation for radioactive
environmental damage in the Arctic region [[is rife with
**uncertainties**]{.mark} and **disputes**]{.underline}.

The [[primary dispute concerning **liability**]{.mark} and
**compensation** [is whether]{.mark}]{.underline} the emissions of
radioactive [[pollution]{.mark} caused by NPVs [should lead to
compensation]{.mark}]{.underline} liability [[**solely** for the
**ship** or]{.mark} whether it should also invoke [the **flag
state**]{.mark}'s **state responsibility**]{.underline} for
compensation. The [[existing]{.mark} nuclear [liability regime]{.mark}
has implemented several]{.underline} crucial [principles to
cope]{.underline} with the liability and compensation issues when
nuclear incidents occur, including "channeling exclusive liability to
nuclear operators, imposing supplementary compensation liability on the
installation states, mandating the provision of financial warranties and
compulsory insurance, setting liability limitations, and granting the
state where a nuclear accident happens with exclusive judicial
jurisdiction" (Handrlica 2009, 2016). [However]{.underline}, [these
principles [may **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily [[be
**applicable**]{.mark} in addressing **liability** and compensation
issues concerning **NPVs**]{.underline}. This is because most nuclear
liability conventions are restricted to "land-based nuclear
installations" and the [[application]{.underline}]{.mark} of these
principles [to NPVs and FNPPs]{.underline} may [[have **practical
challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [[channeling liability
exclusively to ship **operator**]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[**[exonerate]{.mark}** other parties that responsible for vessel
operation such as]{.underline} the [[**owners** or]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[managers]{.underline}]{.mark}** from liabilities (Wang et
al. 2023b). Furthermore, **[[flag states]{.underline}]{.mark}** may be
[[**reluctant** to assume **additional**]{.mark} compensation
**[liability]{.mark}** for NPVs]{.underline}, [**[particularly]{.mark}**
those operating [under]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[flags of
convenience]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Wang et al. 2023a). Despite
attempts by the *Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear
Ships* to address issues surrounding NPVs' liability and compensation,
the convention's ratification has reached an impasse, preventing the
convention from taking effect (Churchill 2001).

#### The plan establishes [cooperative governance]{.underline} over [Arctic FNPPs]{.underline}. Else, [nuclear spills]{.underline} are [inevitable]{.underline}.

Implications and potential ways to move forward

Nuclear energy can offer natural advantages for reducing carbon
emissions in the shipping industry, particularly in the polar region due
to its strong power and long endurance. However, [the fragile ecological
[**environment** of the **polar region**]{.mark} and]{.underline} the
[potential risks associated with nuclear energy have [made]{.mark}
international **organizations** and **[countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}
around the polar region [[**cautious** about allowing nuclear-powered
ships]{.mark} and platforms to operate]{.underline} in these areas. [To
effectively tackle]{.underline} the [legal challenges]{.underline} that
arise in the Arctic, [it is [**crucial** for]{.mark} the **[Arctic
states]{.mark}** and the **international community** [to
**collaborate**]{.mark} and **coordinate**]{.underline} their
[[efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This will enable them to
address]{.underline} pertinent issues such as **[nuclear
safety]{.underline}** and security, [marine environmental
protection]{.underline}, [nuclear **prolif**eration]{.underline}, [and
**geopolitic**al consideration**s**]{.underline}. To achieve this, there
may be a need to revise and strengthen the existing international legal
regime concerning nuclear power used for maritime decarbonization
purpose in the Arctic region, or to develop new instruments that can
address these issues more effectively and comprehensively.

Developing more specific and enforceable international rules and
standards

[It is important to develop international **rules** and **standards**
that are specific to]{.underline} the utilization of [nuclear power for
maritime application]{.underline} purpose in the Arctic region. As
proposed by Lysenko et al. while [[international **convention**]{.mark}s
and voluntary codes of conduct]{.underline} can be applied to Arctic
nuclear safety and security, their [[**applicability** is
**limited**]{.mark} to general terms]{.underline} (Lysenko et al. 2022).
Therefore, [[an **Arctic-specific** agreement is **necessary** to
address]{.mark} the **specific issues** of]{.underline}
"[**[nuclear]{.mark}** and radiological
**[safety]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [emergency [**preparedness** and
**response**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and **cleanup** of radiological
contaminants]{.underline}" in the region (Lysenko et al. 2022).
Specifically, [regulations and **[standards]{.mark}**]{.underline}
governing the utilization of nuclear power for maritime application in
the Arctic must [address a **range** of **interconnected issues**
related to nuclear security and marine pollution control]{.underline}.
[These [should encompass navigation **safety**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[**prevention** of]{.underline}]{.mark} radioactive marine
**[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [management of **radioactive
waste**]{.underline}, [**response** mechanisms]{.underline} for nuclear
and radiological accidents, [[and]{.mark} specialized **[training
req]{.mark}**uirement**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} for crew members of
nuclear-powered vessels and platforms (Lysenko et al. 2022; Wang et
al. 2023b).

Specifically, [there is a [**pressing need** for]{.mark} better
[**coherence** and **harmonization**]{.mark} between **UNCLOS** and
**polar regimes** to]{.underline} effectively address the [passage
management of nuclear-powered vessels]{.underline} and platforms [in the
Arctic]{.underline} region. [[Ongoing **passage
disputes**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic, notably the Northwest
Passage, [[create **tensions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [particularly
between **Canada** and the **US**]{.underline}A. [[Similar
**disagreements** exist over]{.mark} other Arctic sea
routes]{.underline}, [such as [the **N**]{.mark}orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**oute [claimed]{.mark} as a national route [by
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but **contested** by the
**US**]{.underline}]{.mark}A, illustrating the broader international
discord in the region (Farré et al. 2014; Rothwell 2008; Dal 2023).
[Although some]{.underline} Arctic states [have established shipping
regulations]{.underline}, [these]{.underline} regulations [**cannot**
impose **requirements** on the **design**, **construction**, or
**crewing** of foreign nuclear-powered vessels]{.underline} engaged in
innocent passage, unless they are based on internationally recognized
rules or standards for safety of navigation, maritime traffic
management, and control of coastal environmental pollution (UNCLOS 1982,
Article 21; Maes 2008). [To ensure coordination]{.underline} between
UNCLOS and the Arctic navigation system, relevant [international
organizations should strive to promote **compatibility**
between]{.underline} the unilateral [**navigation management** measures
of Arctic states and UNCLOS]{.underline}. This can be achieved by
developing best practices or guidelines to ensure the smooth passage of
nuclear-powered vessels and platforms, while effectively regulating
environmental protection and nuclear safety in the Arctic. [Another
[viable option]{.mark} would be [to promote]{.mark} the [**negotiation**
of **bilateral**]{.mark} or **regional treaties** among Arctic states
and the [licensing]{.mark} states of NPVs and FNPPs]{.underline},
[[where]{.mark}in [a **dedicated route**]{.mark}]{.underline} for NPVs
and FNPPs [[could]{.mark} be designated to [**avoid collisions**
and]{.mark} complex **[ice conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jia 2013).
[This would not only guarantee]{.underline} Arctic states' [**control**
over the waterway but also facilitate **international** navigation and
safety **management**]{.underline}, thereby [**reducing** the risk of
**radioactive contamination**]{.underline} resulting from collisions in
the Arctic region.

Enhancing the monitoring and assessment of environmental risks

[To enhance]{.underline} the [monitoring]{.underline} and assessment of
environmental conditions and risks related to the utilization of nuclear
power for maritime decarbonization purposes in the Arctic, [it is
crucial to implement increased [**monitoring** and
**assessment**]{.mark} efforts]{.underline}. [This will allow for the
timely identification of **emerging risks** and enable the international
community to respond promptly]{.underline} and effectively. Currently,
[IMO]{.underline} has developed a range of measures to manage carbon
emissions arising from maritime transportation. These measures, such as
"the [**E**nergy **E**fficiency **E**xisting **S**hip
**I**ndex]{.underline}, the Carbon Intensity Indicator Rating Scheme,
and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for technical cooperation and
capacity-building initiatives" (IMO 2022; Shi and Gullett 2018; Wang et
al. 2023a), [[can be used as a reference for]{.mark} monitoring [energy
usage]{.mark}]{.underline} conditions [and radioactive
release]{.underline} from nuclear-powered vessels and platforms. This
[[info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation [can [help]{.mark} in
[understand]{.mark}ing the impact on the **marine
[ecosystem]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [providing **rescuers** with
**complete knowledge**]{.underline} of accidents at sea, [[and
develop]{.mark}ing [a]{.mark} highly effective and organized
**[database]{.mark}** system [to **enhance**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**efficiency** and **accuracy** of]{.underline} conducting
[**[e]{.mark}**nvironmental **[i]{.mark}**mpact
**[a]{.mark}**ssessments]{.underline} in marine settings (Liu 2022;
Schwartz-Belkin and Portman 2023).

[[It is **crucial** for **collab**]{.mark}orative efforts [to
**persist** between **governments**]{.mark}]{.underline}, shipping
companies, nuclear industry, [and international **organizations** in
their endeavor to monitor and mitigate nuclear-powered vessels and
platforms]{.underline} related radioactive marine pollution in the
Arctic. Improper and [[inadequate management]{.mark} of waste
discharges]{.underline}, such as ballast nuclear wastewater, could
[[lead to **contamination** of **ports**]{.mark}, **[seas]{.mark}**,
**ice areas**, [and **ecosystems**]{.mark}]{.underline} across the
Arctic. Jiang et al.'s (2023) study on the evolutionary game model
between maritime supervisors and carriers suggests that carriers may
choose to dispose of ballast water after weighing the costs of fines, as
well as maritime and other social regulations. This [underscores the
need for enhancing waste management practices]{.underline},
[strengthening **regul[atory frameworks]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[increas]{.mark}ing monitoring and enforcement]{.underline}, [and
investing in research and [development of
**cleaner**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[**sustainable**
**tech**]{.mark}nologies [for **shipping**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

and occupies only 3% of the world's ocean surface area, [its [impact
on]{.mark} the **[global climate]{.mark} system** is
**disproportionately large**]{.underline}.

[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, though small in area, [it scoops up over
10% of global **[river runoff]{.mark}** and claims twenty of the world's
100 longest rivers]{.underline}.

[[Third]{.mark}, the Arctic marine domain comprises about a third of the
world's **[coastline]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[And **[fourth]{.mark}**, the Arctic Ocean [contains]{.mark} one-quarter
of the world's [**continental shelf**, of **immense**]{.mark}
**socio-ecological [importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

On all counts, the little Arctic Ocean holds its own on the global
stage.

Despite its importance, the Arctic Ocean sometimes goes missing from
public ocean-talk as more 'local' marine issues take centre stage. A key
point for non-experts is to recognize that [the [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean
[is]{.mark} different from other oceans and it is [the **critical
driver** of the **global**]{.mark} **oceanic [conveyor belt]{.mark}**.
For example, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current are strongly
regulated by processes that occur in the Arctic. The Arctic
Ocean]{.underline} is remote to many of us, but its
[**[influence]{.mark}** can be felt
**[everywhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

How do we know this? [Oceanographers have **robust scientific evidence**
on the role the Arctic plays within our planet. [For instance]{.mark},
the **global [hydrological cycle]{.mark}** [determines]{.mark} the
[distribution of water]{.mark} around the planet -- and affects food and
water security globally]{.underline}. This cycle begins in warmer
climates, with the equatorial trade winds and mid-latitude westerlies.
It is refined and shaped by the global distribution of land masses that,
in the northern hemisphere, collect precipitation and direct it poleward
through massive rivers. These rivers introduce substantial amounts of
fresh water into the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean, providing the
required conditions for an ice cover to form, and regulating nutrient
supplies and biological productivity.

[**[Russia controls]{.mark}** almost [**half** of]{.mark} the **[global
capacity]{.mark}** to [enrich **uranium**]{.mark} and has
[established]{.mark} a **[monopoly]{.mark}** over [commercial
supplies]{.mark} of high-assay low-enriched
**[uranium]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Haleu) --- [a [new type]{.mark} of
fuel which is required to power the **[latest generation]{.mark}** of
[reactors]{.mark}. This has left US and European power plant operators
with **[little option]{.mark}**, in the short term, but to
[continue]{.mark} buying **[raw materials]{.mark}** and enrichment
services from Russia's state-owned nuclear giant: Rosatom]{.underline}.
"Just like Europe got over-reliant on Russian gas, the free world
nuclear companies got over-reliant on Russian fuel, which was being
dumped at low prices in our free world countries," says Chris Levesque,
chief executive of engineering company TerraPower. TerraPower is one of
dozens developing new nuclear reactor technologies, which industry
leaders and a growing number of western policymakers argue are needed if
the world is to have any chance of meeting the Paris Agreement target of
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Founded and chaired by
billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, the company plans to start
building the first sodium fast nuclear reactor with on-site energy
storage in the US, in June.

President Emmanuel Macron of France, centre, poses with other leaders
and participants after a nuclear energy session at Cop28 in Dubai last
year TerraPower's proposed reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming, is among the
many projects now tapping into a global upswing of interest in nuclear
power, which is hailed by advocates as a key tool in fighting climate
change and boosting energy security. At the Cop 28 climate conferencein
December, more than 20 nations --- including the US, France and UK ---
pledged to work to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. And
momentum is growing, with world leaders attending a first-of-a-kind
Nuclear Energy Summit this week in Brussels, to discuss funding for the
industry's expansion, [**[with]{.mark}** the International Atomic Energy
Agency (**[IAEA]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. "There has been a sea-change in
global perception and global policymaking towards nuclear energy," says
Rafael Grossi, IAEA director-general, who will co-chair the summit.
"[One [reason]{.mark} is [**global warming**]{.mark} and the
[need]{.mark} to do [**something** about **climate change**]{.mark} and
another is **[energy]{.mark}** **[security]{.mark}** with a [war in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[For much of the **[20th century]{.mark}**, the **[US]{.mark}** and
**[European nations]{.mark}**, such as France, Germany and the UK, were
clear global leaders in the nuclear power sector]{.underline}. But
accidents at the **[[Chernobyl nuclear power
station]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Ukraine in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan
in 2011 caused [[many **western governments**]{.mark} to
[rethink]{.mark} their [commitment]{.mark} to the
**[technology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The pioneering American Centrifuge
Plant in Ohio, which last year began producing Haleu fuel, required to
power a [**[new]{.mark}** [generation of
**reactors**]{.mark}]{.underline} The sudden pullback in investment
sparked a crisis for many private companies supplying uranium and
nuclear-related services, including conversion and enrichment, which are
needed to make the fuel to power reactors. Project delays and cost
overruns also sapped confidence in the industry and forced several
high-profile US companies, such as Centrus Energy Corp and Westinghouse
Electric Co, to file for bankruptcy. Both companies have since been
restructured and are positioning themselves to lead what industry
insiders have dubbed the "nuclear renaissance". But they face tough
competition from state-run companies in Russia, China, and Kazakhstan,
which control key parts of the fuel supply chain and have begun
exporting their technology. Kazakhstan, a country with close economic
and political ties to Moscow, supplied more than a quarter of the
uranium ore used by the US and Europe in 2022.

[**[Russia accounted]{.mark}** for about [12 per cent]{.mark} of **[US
imports]{.mark}** and [17 per cent]{.mark} of [EU imports]{.mark} in the
same year, **[according]{.mark}** to US and EU **[government
agencies]{.mark}**. A 550-ton dome is hoisted in place at the world's
first commercial small modular reactor, Linglong One, in Hainan
province, China, in February Rosatom's vertically integrated supply
chain --- which [encompasses **uranium mining**]{.mark},
**[conversion]{.mark}**, **[enrichment]{.mark}** and fuel
fabrication]{.underline} --- makes it a tough competitor. [China's
state-owned giants, China National Nuclear Corporation and China General
Nuclear Power Group, are also expanding rapidly. All three companies
have begun exporting their **[technologies]{.mark}** and are building
reactors in several countries in Asia and Europe. China and Russia have
both deployed **[small modular reactors]{.mark}** (SMRs) --- a more
compact and efficient reactor that advocates say could transform the
sector --- ahead of more than a **[dozen western
rivals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Carl Fisher, chief operating officer of
NuScale, a US-listed nuclear company, noted last month that China and
Russia were ahead of the US in deploying SMRs due to state-supported
funding models. He said: "\[When\] the Chinese government finances \[a
nuclear project\], they say, 'This is your customer base and here's your
technology' and they just wrap it up. And Russia does the same thing.
[So, **[in the US]{.mark}**, what we lack is the
**[cohesiveness]{.mark}** of **[those three areas]{.mark}**." Western
nations have now begun to adapt their support for the industry. In April
2023, the US, UK, Japan, Canada and France formed a nuclear alliance on
the sidelines of the G7, which the then British energy secretary Grant
Shapps said was [aimed]{.mark} at "[**pushing Putin** out]{.mark} of the
**[nuclear fuel market entirely]{.mark}**".]{.underline}

In December, these nations committed \$4.2bn to develop a secure,
reliable global nuclear energy supply chain, mainly focused on enhancing
enrichment and conversion capacity in the west. The UK and US have
already allocated \$1bn for programmes aimed at making Haleu, which
currently can only be purchased on a commercial basis from Tenex, a
Rosatom subsidiary. [Kathryn Huff, **[US assistant secretary]{.mark}**
for **[nuclear energy]{.mark}**, [says it]{.mark} is **[vital the
US]{.mark}**]{.underline} and its allies [**[rebuild their nuclear
supply chains]{.mark}** and [re-**establish**]{.mark}
**[leadership]{.mark}** for **[environmental]{.mark}** and **[security
reasons]{.mark}**. "There is **[no choice]{.mark}**," she says. "If we
**[don't]{.mark}**, we **[won't control]{.mark}** the
**[conversation]{.mark}** around **[safeguard security]{.mark}**,
**[non-proliferation]{.mark}**, **[safety]{.mark}**, and the
**[standards]{.mark}** that [would **propagate**]{.mark} across the
[world]{.mark}. "But it will be seriously hard because we do need to
**[build reactors]{.mark}** on time and on budget from American
suppliers and suppliers of like-minded nations --- and that can be very
challenging."]{.underline}

[**[Russia]{.mark}** and [**China** continue]{.mark} to [share]{.mark}
Washington's [interest]{.mark} in a **[peaceful]{.mark}**, nuclear
weapons-free Korean **[Peninsula]{.mark}**, an outcome that would have
the benefit, from their perspective, of reducing Washington's need to
respond to North Korean capabilities in a way they would [regard]{.mark}
as **[threatening]{.mark}**, such as a major buildup of U.S. missile
**defenses**]{.underline}. Finding common ground on a negotiated
solution will require the three countries, especially the [United States
and China, to modify their current positions. For Washington, that means
accepting that denuclearization is a long-term, step-by-step
process]{.underline}; that Pyongyang will have to be provided meaningful
incentives at each step of the way; and that the first step will be a
partial measure with no reliable guarantee that the goal of complete
denuclearization will eventually be realized.

For Beijing, it means recognizing that it will have to lean heavily on
North Korea to get it to accept strict and verifiable measures and that,
even if an agreement can be reached that reduces the North Korean
threat, the United States and its allies will continue to reinforce
their capabilities to deter the North. Russia will need to add its
weight to Chinese efforts to encourage more flexible North Korean
negotiating behavior. It will also need to work bilaterally with
Washington, given their unique arms control experience, to demonstrate
to Pyongyang that effective verification measures can be implemented
without compromising national security interests.

[[**Revitalizing** nuclear **security** and **nuclear energy**
cooperation.]{.mark} Nuclear [security]{.mark} is the [most
**promising**]{.mark} area for resuming U.S. [cooperation]{.mark} with

history]{.mark} of **[cooperation]{.mark}** in this area, by the close
**[personal]{.mark}** and [institutional]{.mark} ties that developed

**cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States and China do not
have the extensive record of nuclear security cooperation shared by
Washington and Moscow, but neither do they have the accumulated
resentments and internal opposition toward such cooperation that came to
bedevil U.S.-Russian nuclear security programs. [If U.S.-Russian nuclear
security [cooperation]{.mark} is to be **[resurrected]{.mark}**, it will
have to abandon the past donor-recipient **[relationship]{.mark}** and
become a [more equal **partnership**]{.mark}, with both sides sharing

Floating nuclear power plants (FNPPs) are a type of transportable
nuclear power plant (TNPP). [The contemporary **[FNPP]{.mark}** is a
self-contained, low capacity **configuration** that [provides]{.mark} a
**[safe]{.mark}** and **[clean]{.mark}** **alternative** to conventional
land-based **[energy production]{.mark}**. The FNPP [offers]{.mark}
**many advantages**]{.underline} that will be outlined in more detail
later in this paper, including [[more]{.underline}
**[flexibility]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to quickly provide a
**mechanism** to **generate power** where needed in the
**[international]{.mark} community**. Given that a FNPP is
**transportable**, the nature of **[transport security]{.mark}** of
material flows in the **supply chain** [is **complex**]{.mark} and
potential **[vulnerabilities exist]{.mark}** when nuclear 2 materials
are [in transit]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has long recognized the
vulnerabilities of material in transport, and it has taken great strides
in providing the international community with recommendations and
implementation guidance to directly address the complexity and
vulnerability of materials in transit. [Although FNPPs have been around
for many decades, recently, multiple interested agencies
(**[IAEA]{.mark}** and International Maritime Organization \[IMO\]) have
[**recognized** the **absence**]{.mark} of **[harmonization]{.mark}**
and the [need]{.mark} to **[balance]{.mark}** the **[safer]{.mark}** and
more **[flexible]{.mark}** aspects of the nuclear **[power]{.mark}**
with adequate physical protection considerations. [Ensuring]{.mark}
their safe and **[secure operation]{.mark}** is paramount, especially in
consideration of the **safety-security** interface for operation of
**FNPPs**]{.underline}.

This paper will define a FNPP, discuss the history of the concept, and
describe some early appearances in the nuclear supply chain. The paper
will also explore the international regulatory regimes, physical
protection considerations including the completion of a strength,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, as well as
highlighting other challenges with FNPPs. One challenge that will be
explored in greater detail is the lack of adequate security
considerations from the maritime perspective. Some opportunities in this
arena will be highlighted at the international level.

[Given the numerous agencies involved in the safe and secure transport
of dangerous goods, including **nuclear**, there is a
**[fragmented]{.mark} [framework]{.mark}** that [requires
**harmonization** of **regulatory requirements**]{.mark} and
understanding of how to treat and **subsequently develop** physical
**protection** requirements [for **FNPPs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
overarching goal of this paper is to outline issues surrounding the
physical protection considerations for a FNPP and to [identify areas for
**possible harmonization**, including security by design for future
generations of FNPPs. **Ultimately**, this [work will
**advance**]{.mark} the overall **[nuclear security supply]{.mark}**
chain and support the much-needed [**flexibility** to **provide safe**
and **clean power**]{.mark} to meet the growing needs of the
international community]{.underline}.

#### The ready-made [infrastructure]{.underline} of [FNPP's]{.underline} unlocks [energy access]{.underline} for [isolated regions]{.underline} and [disaster relief zones]{.underline}, solve water [desalination]{.underline} and [energy]{.underline}, significantly [reduce]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline}, and [are key]{.underline} to decarbonize the [world]{.underline}.

3\. THE ENERGY CONUNDRUM

The world's population has reached 8 billion. Whilst the growth rate has
slowed, the demand for energy per capita will not. The US Energy
Information Administration stated "global energy consumption will
increase nearly 50% over the next 30 years." Digital/crypto currency,
data centres, information technology, are new industries with enormous
appetite for energy.

Earth receives a total of 173,000 terawatts of energy continuously,
10,000 times the world's energy demand. Yet we are mining fossil fuels
that have been deposited over millions of years. Obviously, a better way
to harness energy is to tap the radiant energy as it enters the
atmosphere. Solar panels and wind turbines are the tools to harness it.
But are they truly clean?

The cost of solar panels has plummeted over the past decade to just a
few dollars per watt. That is not necessarily good news. It could be the
thin end of the wedge that could accelerate the diminution of
biodiversity. Why? [The cost of **[solar panels]{.mark}** has reached a
level when **discarding old** ones and **replacing** them with **new**
makes **economic se**nse]{.underline}. [The consequence is [an
**avalanche** of **non**]{.mark}bio**[degradable]{.mark}** photovoltaic
**[waste]{.mark}**. Their [leaching heavy **metals**]{.mark} will find
pathways [into **rivers**]{.mark}, **lakes** [and the
**ocean**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Like microplastics it wreaks havoc on
marine life]{.underline}.

Photovoltaic [solar systems have [denuded **millions** of
**hectares**]{.mark} of forest and ground cover]{.underline}. Over its
service life of 20 to 30 years, it takes a toll on bio-diversity as
habitats of hundreds of species are degraded. For example, in Tay Ninh,
near Ho Chi Ming City, Vietnam, 540 hectares of wetland are sacrificed
for the deployment of solar panels.

The [leaching of heavy metal particulates]{.underline} including lead
from photo-voltaic cells (in service as well as abandoned) [is a matter
of concern for biochemists]{.underline}. Evidence suggests that the
[leachates **percolate** into the **soil** and find pathways into
plants, streams and rivers killing both **plants** and **animals**, and
**directly** and indirectly **humankind**]{.underline}.

Cobalt, lithium, nickel, gallium, germanium, indium, cadmium, and lead
are the [basic elements of photovoltaics]{.underline} and they [are
toxic]{.underline}. [As solar panels are replaced every 20 years, the
[demand to **mine** and **process**]{.mark} more of them [**does not**
make the climate **cooler**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [**impact** of **wind farms** on **biodiversity** and **food**
production]{.underline} though not obvious [is **real**]{.underline}. In
nature [seeds are dispersed by wind, insects and birds]{.underline}.
Without seeds, there is no vegetative cover and without vegetative cover
the quality of biodiversity diminishes. [[Wind farms reduce]{.mark} wind
velocity **imped**ing **[seed dispersion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
long-term response of birds and bees to the presence of wind farms is
yet unknown but it is reasonable to suggest that the [[**loss**
of]{.mark} these **[pollinators]{.mark}** will [impact]{.mark} on
[food]{.mark}]{.underline} (grass, grains and hay) for animals and
humans. Total wind turbine output worldwide in 2022 is 837 GW. Based on
an average capacity of 2.5 MW each, there are more than **[300,000
[turbines]{.mark}]{.underline}**. All of these [[will be
**replaced**]{.mark} with new ones after their service life of **20
years**]{.underline}, [[adding to]{.mark} the **[ecological
stress]{.mark}** on the environment]{.underline}. Recycling turbine
blades makes little economic sense.

Multiple articles expressing concern about the sixth mass extinction
have appeared in recent years. Experts opined that land and water
resources are not treated with regard for their long-term viability.
Their concern is we may fail to see the tipping point that triggers a
"catastrophic shift." We need to be mindful when thinking about energy,
of the possibility, however improbable, of a mass extinction caused by
anthropogenic activities. The conundrum is this: Global diversity is as
critical to the survival of the planet as climate change. The pursuit of
carbon neutrality by harnessing wind or solar energy, has the unintended
consequence of reducing global diversity.

The shift from fossil fuels to solar and wind will not necessarily save
humankind. Nobody is certain of the long-term impact of many
technologies; a hundred years ago the internal combustion engine was a
boon, to day it is a bane of civilisation.

4\. NUCLEAR ENERGY

4.1 Safety

Nuclear fission is the process where an atom is split into two or more
parts. Some mass is converted into (heat) energy according Einstein's
equation, E=mc2 . The process does not result in any gas as a
by-product. The spent fuel is in a solid state.

The chain reaction is kept in control by a moderator that limits the
available free neutrons by absorbing them. The heat is absorbed by water
which turns into steam that drives the turbine generator. In the
pressurised water reactor (PWR) design, the steam that drives the
turbine is in a loop separate from the water loop in contact with the
uranium. The residual elements are radioactive but the radiation is
easily shielded by ordinary water in a pool. There is no pressure built
up in the reactor as there are no gaseous by-products.

The explosions at [**Fukushima**, **Chernobyl** and **Three Mile**

plants (NPPs) worldwide with the US having the most, followed by France,
China, Russia and South Korea. Nuclear reactors built more than 40 years

any internal combustion engine or solar or wind farm.

**[[Every degree]{.underline}]{.mark}** of warming up to 2°C [[will
**add**]{.underline}]{.mark} at least 1.3 meters [[to]{.mark} sea
levels]{.underline} from accelerated ice flow into the ocean [and
melting from]{.underline} the Antarctic Ice Sheet, while
**[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}** between 2°C and 6°C is predicted to
add 2.4 meters per degree (Garbe, Albrecht, Levermann, Donges and
Winkelmann, 2020).

While the IPCC Working Group III reports frequently refer to
\'cost-effectiveness\', the cost against which the effectiveness is
being assessed never includes the cost that would arise from exceeding a
climate tipping point.

It should also be noted that there are no credible technological
solutions for many climate change impacts: for example, the Arctic and
boreal permafrost contain 1460 to 1600 Gt of organic carbon, almost
twice the carbon in the atmosphere (WMO, 2020), and if gigatonnes of
methane are released from melting permafrost and warming oceans, the
process cannot be reversed.

Fact 3.2: The deadly impacts and costs of increasingly acidifying oceans
are also greatly underestimated.

When [[carbon]{.mark} dioxide]{.underline} combines with seawater it
forms carbonic acid, which [[makes the **ocean**]{.mark} more
**[acidic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since around 1850, the oceans have
absorbed between a third and a half of the CO2 emitted to the
atmosphere. As a result, the average pH of ocean surface waters has
fallen from 8.2 to 8.1 units. This corresponds to a 30% increase in
ocean acidity, a rate of change roughly 10 times faster than any time in
the last 55 million years (CoastAdapt, 2017; Jiang et al., 2023).

If GHG emissions continue at the current rate (the RCP8.5 trajectory),
by the end of the century average pH is projected to decrease by
0.3--0.4 units (∼100%--150% increase in acidity) (Kwiatkowski et al.,
2020). Increasing acidity will make it difficult for marine organisms
such as corals, clams, mussels, crabs, and some plankton, to form
calcium carbonate, the material used to build shells and skeletal
material. [The **survival** of]{.underline} many microscopic [**marine
species** will]{.underline} also [be **threatened**]{.underline} (Bird,
2023). In addition, [ocean acidification will
[disrupt]{.mark}]{.underline} pelagic **[[food
webs]{.underline}]{.mark}** via the proliferation of toxic algal blooms
(Doney et al., 2020). The increasing degradation of marine food chains
will seriously damage fishing industries and tourism.

[**[Ocean]{.mark}** system[**s**]{.mark} are [**not** able to **adapt**
to]{.mark} these **[rapid]{.mark}** changes in **[acidity]{.mark}**---a
process that **naturally** occurs over **millennia**]{.underline}.
Declining ocean pH levels will persist as long as concentrations of
atmospheric CO2 continue to rise. The stress on marine organisms will be
exacerbated by rising temperatures and exposure to multiple
biogeochemical changes. [[To avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} significant
[[harm to]{.underline}]{.mark} critical marine ecosystems and [[the
food]{.mark} security [of **billions**]{.mark}]{.underline} of people,
atmospheric concentrations of atmospheric [[**CO2** must be]{.mark}
rapidly **[reduced]{.mark}**]{.underline} to at least 320-350 ppm or
less (IUCN, 2017).

Fact 3.3: Virtually irreversible tipping points are already being
passed. [Acceleration of]{.underline} the rate of [**[climate]{.mark}**
change [is a real]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[**existential**
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Climate tipping points (CTPs) are irrevocable changes in the climate,
such as the melting of ice sheets, or the dieback of rainforests. [These
are points of **no return**]{.underline}: once glaciers and ecosystems
like coral reefs have disappeared, they cannot be restored. For example,
warming oceans make the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
unavoidable (Naughten, Holland and De Rydt, 2023). Evidence is all
around us that we are nearing or have already crossed CTPs associated
with critical parts of the Earth system---we see catastrophic fires in
rainforests, spreading deserts, degrading ecosystems, and shrinking sea
ice (e.g., Walsh, 2016; Bochow and Boers, 2023; Kim et al., 2023).

Another example is rainfall in Greenland, which has increased by 33%
since 1991, with flooding rain darkening and melting the ice sheet and
baring rocks (Box et al., 2023). However, the accelerating rate of melt
and the positive feedbacks of increasing rainfall and reducing albedo
are not represented in IPCC models.

Armstrong McKay and colleagues (2022) identify six **[[tipping
points]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[are **likely**]{.mark} to be
crossed]{.underline} within the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5°C - 2°C
of warming. **[These are:]{.underline}**

Greenland Ice Sheet collapse

West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse

[**[Coral]{.mark}** reef [die off]{.mark}]{.underline} at low latitudes

[Sudden **[thawing]{.mark}** of [permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline} in
northern regions

[[Abrupt]{.mark} sea **[ice loss]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Barents
Sea

[Collapse of ocean **circulation** in the]{.underline} high-latitude
North **[Atlantic]{.underline}**

They point out that crossing these climate tipping points can generate
positive feedbacks that will increase the likelihood of crossing other
CTPs. For example, Arctic permafrost may permanently thaw even if
warming stays between 1.1 °C and 1.5°C. Above 1.5°C of warming, losing
the permafrost becomes "likely," and we are currently on track for 2.7°C
of warming in this century. If all the permafrost thawed, [emissions
would be [equivalent]{.mark} to [**51 times** all]{.mark} GHG
**[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2019.

Alarmingly, the ESCIMO climate model indicates that a self-sustaining
process of permafrost thaw has already begun, which suggests that the
world is already past a point-of-no-return for global warming. This
cycle consists of decreasing surface albedo, increasing water vapour
feedback and increasing thawing of the permafrost, which releases both
methane and carbon dioxide, resulting in even further temperature rises,
and so on. Even after no more man-made GHG are emitted, this cycle will
continue on its own until all carbon is released from permafrost and all
ice is melted (Randers and Goluke, 2020).

The likelihood of passing additional CTPs becomes non-negligible at
\~2°C and increases greatly at \~3°C. Above 2°C the Arctic would very
likely become summer ice-free, and land carbon sink-tosource transitions
would become widespread.

Scientists are detecting warning signs for many CTPs. For example,
researchers have found an almost complete loss of stability of the
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). These currents are
already at their slowest point in at least 1,600 years, and new analysis
indicates that the AMOC could collapse between 2025 and 2095, with a
central estimate of 2050, if global carbon emissions are not reduced
(Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen, 2023). This would have catastrophic
consequences, severely disrupting the rains that billions of people
depend on for food in India, South America and West Africa; increasing
storms and lowering temperatures in Europe; and raising sea levels in
the eastern North America (Boers, 2021)

The IPCC's highest-end GHG concentration pathway, RCP 8.5, remains close
to observations in many regions and may eventuate if negative feedback
loops are activated, such as emissions from melting permafrost and
forest die-backs (Schwalm, Glendon and Duffy, 2020). Both of the
high-emission pathways considered in the IPCC's most recent Working
Group I report contain 4°C increases in the "very likely" range for 2081
through 2100, temperatures that many scientists believe would pose a
significant threat to civilization (Steel, DesRoches, Mintz-Woo, 2022).

Tipping elements have been identified in all earth systems including
cryosphere, ocean circulation systems and the biosphere, and [a growing
risk is]{.underline} that even if the Paris Agreement targets are met,
[[a **cascade**]{.mark} of]{.underline} positive [feedbacks could
**[push]{.mark}** the [Earth]{.mark}]{.underline} System irreversibly
[[onto a]{.mark} "**[Hothouse]{.mark} Earth**"
[path]{.mark}way]{.underline} (Steffen et al. 2018; Klose, Karle,
Winkelmann and Donges, 2020). During the last glacial period abrupt
climate changes sometimes occurred within decades, with temperatures
over the Greenland ice-sheet warming by 8°C to 16°C at each event
(Corrick et al., 2020).

The IPCC has been cautious in its evaluation of climate tipping points.
For example, its latest report stated that there was a chance of a
tipping point in the Amazon by the year 2100. However, while most
studies only focus on one driver of destruction, such as climate change
or deforestation, in reality ecosystems are simultaneously impacted by
multiple interacting threats, e.g., water stress, degradation and
pollution. [Because [tipping points]{.mark} can]{.underline} amplify and
[[**accelerate** one **another**]{.underline}]{.mark}, more than a fifth
of [eco[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} worldwide, including the Amazon
rainforest, [are at **[risk]{.mark}** of a catastrophic [**breakdown**
within a]{.mark} single **human [life]{.mark}**]{.underline}time
(Willcock et al., 2023). Record drought in Amazonia in 2023 suggests [we
are **much closer** to these]{.underline} thresholds [than models
**predict**]{.underline}.

Fact 3.4: [[It is **impossible** to adapt]{.mark} to
irreversible]{.underline}, catastrophic [impacts]{.underline} like
species extinction, the loss of glaciers, rising sea levels, and the
release of methane from permafrost and oceans.

IPCC scenarios assume that if overshoot occurs, temperatures can be
returned to safe levels by 2100 through large-scale CDR (Anderson,
2015). The caveat is that [**many** of [the]{.mark}
proposed]{.underline} CDR [**[measures]{.mark}** may [not be
**politically** and]{.mark}]{.underline}/or
**[[techn]{.underline}]{.mark}**olog[[**ically**
feasible]{.underline}]{.mark} (IPCC, 2018). [**Most** policy
makers]{.underline} also [assume]{.underline} that most
[human]{.underline} and environmental [systems will]{.underline} be able
to **[adapt]{.underline}** to a few degrees of higher temperatures
without serious consequences. Unfortunately, both
[assumptions]{.underline} are questionable and [**don't match**
available **evidence**]{.underline} (IPCC, 2018).

Many changes will be irreversible. For example, the International
Cryosphere Climate Initiative points out that while it will only take a
global mean temperature increase of around 1.6°C to melt most of the
Greenland Ice Sheet, it will take another ice age to replace the lost
ice (ICCI, 2015; Bochow et al., 2023).

Climate change has already driven some species to extinction and is
expected to drive many more species and ecosystems towards tipping
points that are beyond their adaptive capacity (RománPalacios and Wiens,
2020). The IPCC notes that: "Extinction of species is an irreversible
impact of climate change, with increasing risk as global temperatures
rise (very high confidence). The median values for percentage of species
at very high risk of extinction...are 9% at 1.5°C rise in GSAT, 10% at
2°C, 12% at 3.0°C, 13% at 4°C and 15% at 5°C (high confidence), with the
likely range of estimates having a maximum of 14% at 1.5°C and rising to
a maximum of 48% at 5°C." (IPCC, 2022, p. 202)

For a foretaste of the future, we can look at how climate change has
already increased wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned
area (MacCarthy, Tyukavina, Weisse and Harris, 2022). For example, the
megafires that engulfed south-eastern Australia in 2019--2020 were so
intense that they burned habitats rarely exposed to fire, killing or
displacing nearly three billion mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs
(WWF, 2020). Counting tiny invertebrates, 120 trillion creatures died in
the fires (Gibb and Porch, 2023). These fires do irreversible damage:
complex forest ecosystems cannot adapt to fires of this scale and
intensity, and their thousands of interconnected species cannot be
repopulated by human interventions.

Extinction is forever, and losing many keystone species and critical
ecosystems will do catastrophic damage not only to the environment, but
also to our human societies, which utterly depend on the biosphere for
health and sustenance. Tragically, since it is impossible to adapt to
these catastrophes, most politicians find it easier to pretend that each
crisis is an aberration, rather than early warnings of an ever more
deadly trend.

Fact 3.5: Incomplete accounting is resulting in fundamentally flawed
assessments of risks and costs.

The current approach to managing climate change risks is fundamentally
flawed because the risks and costs of failing are likely catastrophic
and therefore unacceptable (Kemp, Xu, Depledge, Lenton 2022; Kimball,
2022).

As David Spratt points out, "The fact that the IPCC incorporates in its
core business risks of failure to the Earth system and to human
civilisation that we would not accept in our own lives raises
fundamental questions about the efficacy of the whole IPCC project....
IPCC carbon budgets regularly include risks of failure (overshooting the
target) of 33% or 50%, that is, a one-in-two or one-in-three risk of
failure. Thus a 2-degree carbon budget with a 50% chance actually has a
10% risk of ending up with 4 degrees of warming, which is incompatible
with the maintenance of human civilization.

"These are risks of failure that no government or person would agree to
in any other aspect of life --- whether it be buildings and bridges,
safety fences or car seats --- where acceptable failure rates are tiny
fractions of one per cent. The fact that the IPCC incorporates in its
core business risks of failure to the Earth system and to human
civilisation that we would not accept in our own lives raises
fundamental questions about the efficacy of the whole IPCC project."
(Spratt, 2023)

Robert Pindyck argues that the integrated assessment models
(**[IAMs]{.underline}**) used to estimate the social cost of carbon
(SCC) and evaluate alternative abatement policies [have **crucial
flaws**: some inputs]{.underline} (such as the discount rate) [are
**arbitrary**]{.underline}, but have huge effects on the models' final
estimates; the [models\']{.underline} descriptions of the [impact of
**climate** change are **ad hoc**, without]{.underline} theoretical or
[**empirical** foundation]{.underline}; and the models ignore the most
important driver of the SCC, the possibility of a catastrophic climate
outcome. "IAM-based analyses of climate policy create a perception of
knowledge and precision, but that perception is illusory and
misleading." (Pindyck, 2013)

A major problem with [these]{.underline} cost-benefit
**[models]{.underline}** is that they [estimate]{.underline} future
[climate damage based on]{.underline} the analyses of [**past weather**
impacts]{.underline} (Pezzey, 2019). The evaluation of climate risks
needs to take into account not only linear developments and their
impacts, but also likely non-linear developments since climatic tipping
elements, climatically sensitive social tipping elements, and
climate-economic shocks may be the largest contributors to the costs of
climate change (Kopp, Shwom, Wagner and Yuan, 2016). The economist
Nicholas Stern (2016) argues that while these hard-to-predict estimates
are difficult to estimate, future IPCC reports need to take them into
account as they have the most troubling potential consequences. Another
area that deserves more attention is the higher-risk scenarios, which
are less predictable but also hold more devastating implications.

\[Text Condensed, None Omitted\]

A study conducted by William Nordhaus noted, 'Natural scientists'
estimates \[of the damages from climate change\] were 20--30 times
higher than mainstream economists'' (Nordhaus, 1994, p. 49).
Nevertheless, the IPCC 2014 report reflects the economists' conservative
outlook: "For most economic sectors, the impact of climate change will
be small relative to the impacts of other drivers (medium evidence, high
agreement). Changes in population, age, income, technology, relative
prices, lifestyle, regulation, governance, and many other aspects of
socioeconomic development will have an impact on the supply and demand
of economic goods and services that is large relative to the impact of
climate change." (Arent et al., 2014, p. 662) After summarizing the
peer-reviewed economic literature, the 2022 IPCC Report concluded that:
"warming of \~4°C may cause a 10--23% decline in annual global GDP by
2100 relative to global GDP without warming." (IPCC 2022, p. 2459) In
contrast, Pearce and Parncutt (2023) argue that global warming of even 2
°C will kill approximately 1 billion (mainly poorer) humans, and many
climate scientists argue that the impact of even a 3°C increase could be
"catastrophic" (e.g., Kemp et al. 2022). DeFries et al. (2019) suggest
that IPCC economic assessments of the potential future risks of climate
change grossly underestimate many of the most serious consequences
because these risks are difficult to quantify precisely and lie outside
of human experience. Steve Keen suggests that it would have been prudent
for the IPCC to have climate scientists peer review the climate change
assumptions made in economic papers, as most economists have little
expertise in the area. Instead, referees with expertise only in
economics approved the publication of economic impact assessments that
climate scientists would almost certainly have disputed. As a result,
the empirical components of the vast majority of climate change economic
papers are based on scientifically false assumptions that drastically
underestimate the likely economic damages of climate change (Keen,
2023). Keen believes that the reasons why economists' estimates of
future climate change damage have been much more optimistic than the
forecasts of scientists is because economists used three spurious
methods to estimate damage: assuming that about 90% of GDP will be
unaffected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the
relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the future
impacts of global warming; and using surveys that dilute extreme
warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists.
"Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages
from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than
forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival
of human civilization." (Keen, 2020) Section 4: IPCC assessments are
wrong Fallacy 4: Climate models represent all possible future risks from
climate change, and IPCC assessments and international agreements are
objective and accurate Fact 4.1: The Paris Agreement has created
confusion by focusing on maximum acceptable temperatures, rather than on
the need to reduce the EEI. The ultimate objective of the 1992 United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol
is "to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a
time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables
sustainable development." (UNFCCC, 2023). However, the IPCC moved from
an atmospheric stabilization target to an average surface temperature
target, in order to keep having achievable targets, mostly with an
"inspirational" objective. The result is that rather than focusing
attention on reducing the EEI, the Paris Agreement negotiated
temperature goals that are dangerously high, unsafe, unstable and
probably unachievable with the proposed policies. Temperature targets
became acceptable with a scientific and political convergence on
defining 2°C as a boundary beyond which there would be risks to many
unique threatened ecosystems, a large increase in the number of extreme
weather events, sea level rise and the risk of triggering dangerous
instabilities in the climate system. The 2°C target has become a
critical part of the EU, UN Conference of Parties, and other
organizations policies, both because it provides a clear goal for
(gradual) decarbonization efforts, and because it suggests that
temperature rises below this target can be safely managed. The IPCC's
fourth assessment report from 2007 (AR4) stated that in order to keep
global average surface temperature increases at 2°C to 2.4 °C above
pre-industrial values by the end of this century, atmospheric emissions
need to be stabilized at 445 to 490 ppm of CO2e (IPCC, 2007). AR4 also
stated that in order to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2e at
450 ppm, anthropogenic CO2 emissions needed to peak in 2015, and Annex I
countries would have to make emission reductions of 25--40% by 2020, and
80--95% by 2050. Even though the 450 ppm CO2e threshold was exceeded by
2014, this analysis provided the basis for subsequent UNFCCC
negotiations (Lucas, 2021). Not only is the 2°C target now almost
certainly unachievable, but even the research justifying the 450 ppm
CO2e/2°C target is questionable, as it ignored paleoclimate research on
the relationship between GHG concentrations and temperatures (Hansen et
al. 2020; Lucas, 2021a). (See section 4.2) Research by Katrina von
Schuckmann et al. (2020) concluded that to ensure a safe, stable
climate, maximum concentrations of GHGes will have to be reduced to
approximately 350 ppm CO2e. Above these levels, rising temperatures
increasingly destabilize the climate system through the introduction of
positive feedbacks. Proponents of the planetary boundary framework argue
that climate change thresholds should be framed in terms of atmospheric
CO2 concentrations rather than temperature (Mathias et al., 2017). Below
350 ppm is safe, 350--550 ppm is dangerous, and above 550 ppm is
catastrophic.

Fact 4.2: Most [[models do **not** include]{.mark} long-term
**[feedbacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} identified in paleoclimate research,
and thus do not simulate the full climatic responses evident in the
Earth's climatic history.

Because there is little pre-industrial data, and due to the focus on
shorter timescales, most models ignore [[the **paleo**]{.mark}climatic
**[record]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, historical evidence
[[indicates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [high **[GHG]{.mark}**
concentration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} are likely to
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} much [**[higher temp]{.mark}**erature[**s**
than]{.mark}]{.underline} are [indicated by [current
**modelling**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact,
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [**[present]{.mark}**
anthropogenic **[carbon]{.mark}** release [**rate** has no
precedent]{.mark} since the
**P**]{.underline}alaeocene--**[E]{.underline}**ocene
**[T]{.underline}**hermal **[M]{.underline}**aximum 66 million years
ago, some scientists argue that [[climate]{.mark}
conditions]{.underline} are increasingly entering 'no-analogue' state
that [[**cannot** be]{.underline}]{.mark} readily
**[[modelled]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Zeebe, Ridgwell and Zachos 2016;
Lear et al. 2020).

Most of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} early **[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}**
used [[in IPCC]{.mark} models [is]{.mark} from the **19th
century**]{.underline}, a time-frame that may be [[too short to
**enable**]{.mark} accurate **[forecasts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Based
on assessments of climate dynamics over the last 66- million-years,
James Hansen and his colleagues argue that more than
[[**80%**of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[warming from]{.underline}]{.mark}
past GHG [[emissions has **yet to emerge**]{.mark}, once]{.underline}
slow [feedbacks]{.underline} from ice sheet cover, vegetation and
long-lived GHGs other than CO2 (not all of these feedbacks are included
in IPCC models) [are taken into account]{.underline} (Hansen et al.,
2023). These findings would have two major implications: first, that
committed warming from existing concentrations of GHGs will continue to
accelerate especially as the cooling effect from man-made aerosol
pollution declines, potentially reaching 5°C above preindustrial levels
by 2100 even when considering emission pathways lower than RCP8.5; and
second, that that global average temperatures will continue to rise over
the next 400 years.

The next 400 years may not matter to currently living beings, but the
period up to 2100 does. Continued global heating would intensify all the
disastrous impacts that are already occurring. The question of elevated
GHG levels has to be seriously addressed: many experts believe that
[tipping **cascades**]{.underline} caused by rising temperatures [could
be an **existential** threat to **civilization**]{.underline} (Lenton et
al, 2019).

\[Text Condensed, None Omitted\]

Assessments of future risks also need to be better informed by
paleoclimatic precedents. For example, modeling, paleoclimate evidence,
and on-going observations together imply that 2 ◦C global warming above
the preindustrial level could be dangerous (Hansen et al., 2016). Levels
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are 1.5 times higher now than they
were 400,000 years ago, when a large part of Greenland was ice-free: if
Greenland's ice sheet melts completely, sea levels will rise by 7
meters, devastating coastal cities (Paddison, 2023). 125,000 years ago,
a brief episode of meltwater-induced weakening of the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) resulted in a massive CH4
release (Weldeab et al., 2022): new research warns that there is a risk
that the AMOC may severely slow down during this century, up to the
point of a functional shut down (Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen, 2023). Rapid
global warming and accompanying ocean oxygen loss led to the
Permian-Triassic mass extinctions (Penn, Deutsch, Payne and Sperling
2018), and Rothman (2017) estimates that carbon emissions are likely to
reach the tipping point for the next catastrophic mass extinction event
by 2100. Fact 4.3: Models incorrectly assume that rising temperatures
will have incremental impacts, and that overshoot can be managed with
adaptive measures and reversed within decades. Due to imperfect
representations, especially in the biosphere, of the dynamics of the
climate system, most models project that rising temperatures will have
incremental impacts, and that overshoot can be managed and reversed. In
reality many changes will be irreversible and catastrophic (e.g., the
loss of species and glaciers), and many changes will be non-linear due
to positive feedbacks and exceeding tipping points. These feedback loops
have not yet been modelled in NZE scenarios (Climate Council, 2021).
IPCC analyses tend to presume that steady decadal average increases in
global average temperatures rises will have incrementally rising global
impacts. Many types of impacts are a result of short-term fluctuations
above the mean, such as very intense storms and extended periods of very
high-heat index. These concentrate their impacts over relatively small
regions, overwhelm plausible adaptive measures, and set back regional
development by decades. It is aperiodic extreme events that lead to the
most damage. The assessments tend to significantly underestimate the
devastating non-linear and long-lasting environmental, economic, and
social disruption that occurs, and this will become especially the case
as the Paris targets are overshot. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report
concludes that erratic climate events will continue throughout this
century, with multiple climate hazards occurring simultaneously, and
that multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, compounding
overall risk and causing risks to cascade across sectors and regions
(IPCC, 2021). Nevertheless, although the IPCC has discussed nonlinear
responses in successive assessments and special reports, the word
'nonlinear' is not mentioned in the AR6 Summary for Policymakers.
Critics within the scientific community also argue that IPCC assessment
reports have failed to capture the speed at which climatic changes have
actually taken place (Pearson et al., 2015), to acknowledge that the
global average temperature is already at a dangerous level, or to
accurately assess the risks and costs associated with overshooting safe
limits. For example, although the IPCC assessed in 2018 that there is
now a high probability that the 1.5°C target will be passed, it
neglected to highlight the probability of catastrophic climate damages
if these temperatures are maintained (Xu and Ramanathan, 2017). As a
result, there is a growing disconnect between how climate risk is
characterized and interpreted by many climate scientists, and the way
the IPCC selects and represents relevant research. Some believe that
critical findings are often been de-emphasised or ignored in the highly
technical reports of Working Group I, or not given due consideration in
the summaries for policymakers compiled by Working Groups II and III
(Lucas, 2021a). An increasing number of climate scientists argue that a
new climate policy regime is required which takes into account the
nonlinearity of the climate system and which places greater focus on
preventing more tipping points from being crossed over the coming
decades (e.g., Lenton et al., 2019). As Kopp et al. (2017) point out,
there have been many times during the earth's history when the earth's
climate has been pushed past a critical threshold. Frequently this has
thrown it into a period of chaotic fluctuations, after which it has
settled into a new and very different dynamic regime. It is important to
recognize that climate change is only one of multiple interacting
non-linear threats to the global environment: in the planetary boundary
framework (Richardson et al., 2023), many of them have been declared as
transgressed, potentially placing Earth outside of the safe operating
space for humanity (Richardson et al., 2023). The 2023 State of the
Climate Report (Ripple et al., 2023) points out that 20 of Earth's 35
vital signs are now showing record extremes. "Life on planet Earth is
under siege. We are now in an uncharted territory.... We are entering an
unfamiliar domain regarding our climate crisis, a situation no one has
ever witnessed firsthand in the history of humanity." Fact 4.4: Analyses
tend to minimize the likelihood and risks of high-temperature scenarios,
although these are already occurring and are the most dangerous.
Although the IPCC has published fourteen special reports, none have
covered extreme or catastrophic climate change. Considering temperature
increases alone rather than heat index tends to minimize the seriousness
and risks of high-temperature scenarios, even though it is combined
temperature and humidity increases that most threaten workers and the
public. In the latest assessment report (AR6), only 14% of the
temperature mentions are above 2°C, although on the current trajectory
global average temperatures will rise more than 2°C (Jehn et al., 2022).
These omissions are especially egregious given that temperatures are
already dangerous with extreme weather events becoming more frequent and
damaging (Di Capua and Rahmstorf, 2023; Davariashtiyani et al., 2023),
and because a number of climate tipping points will almost certainly be
passed in the coming decades. As explained in Section 3, passing tipping
points will have irreversible, catastrophic consequences. It is far too
soon to count on the success of current mitigation efforts. Both of the
high-emission pathways considered in the most recent IPCC report contain
4°C increases in the "very likely" range for 2081 through 2100. Many
scientists believe that these temperatures would pose a significant
threat to civilization.

[study]{.underline}]{.mark}[, published in Nature]{.underline}
Geoscience Monday, [sought to understand the]{.underline} mechanisms
behind an event known as the \"[**[Great Dying]{.mark}**,\"
t]{.underline}he University of Saint Andrews explained in a press
release. This was a period around 252 million years ago between the
Permian and Triassic epochs in which 95 percent of marine species were
wiped out within tens of thousands of years. [It]{.underline} [[is
the]{.underline} **[closest life on Earth has come to total

[[Scientists]{.mark} have [advanced many theories]{.mark}]{.underline}
for what caused this turn of events, including a release of methane from
the seafloor and volcanic activity, [but this is the first time a group
has]{.underline} **[[determined the exact cause]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, one of the research
centers involved in the new study, said. The extinction process went
something like this, as Saint Andrews explained. A volcanic eruption in
what is now Siberia sent 100,000 billion tonnes of [[carbon]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark}to [[the atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
release **[[led to ocean acidification]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
warming, which was [especially deadly to marine life that requires
calcium carbonate]{.underline} for their shells and skeletons. The
atmospheric [[warming increased]{.underline}]{.mark} [the rates of
chemical weathering on land]{.underline}. [This caused more]{.underline}
**[nutrients to run off into]{.underline}** [the ocean,]{.underline}

researchers, who also included members of the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam
GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, were able to reach their
conclusions by examining the shells of fossil brachiopods. \"These are
clam-like organisms that have existed on Earth for more than 500 million

[researchers were able to assess]{.underline} the [pH levels in the

14.4.1 Relevant Risk Management Principles "What all the wise men
promised has not happened, and what all the damned fools said would
happen has come to pass." (Eighteenth- century UK Prime Minister Lord
Melbourne)85 Transition towards the general vision for energy systems in
2100 outlined in Section 14.3.3 involves systems with high levels of
complexity, uncertainty with regards to future technologies and
weather/climate risk, and ambiguity with regards to competing societal
values. Because of the role of electricity as the backbone of societal
support systems, risks to the electric power system are systemic risks.
Risk and uncertainty sciences provides structure and logic on how to
think and act in relation to risk and uncertainties (Chapters Eleven and
Twelve). The risk management principle of proportionality provides a
framework to guide action when there are competing demands on public
policy decisions. [[Focusing on one set of
risks]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[CO2]{.underline}]{.mark}
emissions---[[can create]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}**]{.mark},
potentially [more]{.underline} [**[dangerous]{.underline}**
[risks]{.underline}]{.mark}[. If [efforts]{.mark} to reduce CO2
emissions [result in electric power]{.mark} that is [less
abundant]{.mark}]{.underline}, less reliable, and less secure, then [the
[transition]{.mark} will [make people]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[worse]{.mark} off]{.underline}** now and very possibly in the
future.

The Russian war on Ukraine provides a stark conflict between net-zero
emissions goals versus immediate needs for abundant, reliable, and
secure energy. The dangers from inadequate, unreliable, and insecure
electricity supply are well known and becoming increasingly apparent as
European and other countries struggle with inadequate natural gas
supplies that they had been receiving from Russia. By contrast, the
dangers from CO2 emissions are much more uncertain, with a long time
horizon and a far weaker knowledge base. The debate is then between
imposition of certain, intolerable risks from the rapid transition away
from fossil fuels, versus the highly uncertain future impacts from
climate change. [[This conflict can be]{.underline}
**[resolved]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[relaxing]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[time horizon]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[reducing CO2 emissions]{.underline}** [while]{.underline}
**[maintaining energy]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[abundance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, reliability, and security through

for]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[abundant]{.underline}**]{.mark}, reliable,
and secure sources of **[[energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the global
population. As discussed previously in this book, [[the]{.underline}
**[urgency]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[reducing]{.underline}**
CO2 **[emissions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [has been [diminished]{.mark}
[by acknowledgment]{.mark} of the [implausibility]{.mark} of extreme
[emissions scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline} (Section 7.1) [and postulated
extremely high values of climate sensitivity to CO2]{.underline}
(Section 7.2). Plausible scenarios of natural climate variability in the
mid- twenty-first century point to a slowdown in the rate of global
warming (Section 8.2). Growing clarification of the role of natural
weather climate variability, land use, and governance issues in causing
societal problems is diminishing their attribution to CO2 emissions
(Section 13.1.3). And mitigation of short-lived carbon pollutants
(Section 14.2) buys additional time for reducing CO2 emissions

be towed to a special deconstruction facility and spent fuel taken to
special storage facilities.12

The overall cost of the Akademik Lomonosov has not been disclosed and is
unknown. Critics say that the project is unreasonably expensive.
[However, Russian **authorities claim** that [it is **cheaper** than
**alternatives**]{.mark}. Even though the upfront investment is
admittedly larger compared to wind turbines and solar panels, the

Until [**[recently]{.mark}**, ocean nuclear power plants
(**[ONPPs]{.mark}**) [**seemed** mostly]{.mark} a
**[theoretical]{.mark}** and **[futuristic
vision]{.mark}**.]{.underline} However, [[technical advances]{.mark} and
[**major** economic **interests**]{.mark} have [contributed
**significantly**]{.mark} to the [potential]{.mark} of ONPPs.1 The
**[Arctic]{.mark}**, with its vast marine areas, [sparsely populated
coasts]{.mark}, and **[rising energy needs]{.mark}**, [seems]{.mark} a
**[promising region]{.mark}** for ONPPs. [While]{.mark} the **[technical
challenges]{.mark}** are clearly **[many]{.mark}**, **[States]{.mark}**
with [**prior experience** with **usage**]{.mark} of **[nuclear
power]{.mark}** at sea are [in]{.mark} a **[lead
position]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[**Russia**, with]{.mark} its [history]{.mark} of [**nuclear
icebreakers** and **submarines**]{.mark}, was **[first]{.mark}** to
place an **[ONPP]{.mark}** in the Arctic. The Akademik Lomonosov was
built in Saint Petersburg and towed in 2018 through the Gulf of Finland,
across the Baltic Sea and along the Norwegian coast to Murmansk, where
[it]{.mark} was **[fully loaded]{.mark}** before [deployment]{.mark} in
the [city of Pevek]{.mark} some 5[,000 kilometres]{.mark} further to the
east]{.underline}. The project was criticised by environmental groups
and caused some international concern.2 However, [**[Russia]{.mark}**
has [stated]{.mark} that the [project **boosts** the **power
supply**]{.mark} in remote areas with dire [development needs]{.mark}.
For similar reasons, China has expressed an interest in deploying ONPPs
in the disputed South China Sea]{.underline}.3

The concept of ONPPs raises many legal and broader conceptual questions
relating to several fields of international law. Compared to land-based
nuclear power, many legal issues arising from ONPPs are of specific
character and a more transnational nature. [The [typical need]{.mark}
for **[maritime transport]{.mark}** means that [more **States** and
**communities**]{.mark} are [affected]{.mark}, for example, the ones
along whose coasts the power plant is being transported. The requirement
for [underwater cables]{.mark} also [raises transnational
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, the marine environment is
naturally interlinked and unknowing of any borders, making accidents and
environmental hazards generally transboundary matters.

In the case of deployment in the Arctic, there is also the [[special
Arctic dimensions]{.underline}]{.mark} -- remoteness, [[harsh]{.mark}
**[weather conditions]{.mark}**, [sensitive **environment**]{.mark},
global **[security issues]{.mark}** -- which raise special legal
questions]{.underline}. For example, the Arctic Sea is the only ocean
without a dedicated regional environmental organisation. Even though
three binding international agreements have in recent years been
concluded within the Arctic Council, it is indisputable that
international cooperation concerning the Arctic remains challenging.4

In December 2019, [[Russia]{.mark} connected its first floating nuclear
powerplant]{.underline} (**[[FNPP]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [named
Akademik Lomonosov]{.underline}, [to the electricity grid at the
northeastern city Pevek]{.underline}: [a rather isolated, Artic port
town located]{.underline} in the Chaunskaya Bay of the East Siberian
Sea. [[Built and operated by]{.mark} the Russian state-owned
cooperation]{.underline} "**[[Rosatom]{.underline}]{.mark}**," this is
the first of seven or eight planned powerstations, each 145 meters long
and 35 meters wide. The aim of these FNPPs is to supply both electricity
and heat sustainably and reliably to isolated arctic areas that are
usually cut off from traditional power sources.

Construction of the first FNPP started in April of 2007 and fuel loading
was complete by October of 2018 costing Russia about 7.631 billion
rubles (248 million USD). These FNPPs can go three years without
refueling and have a total lifetime of 40 years, with each being able
to provide 70 MW of electricity and 300 MW of heat; enough to supply
200,000 people with energy. [Other countries such
as **[Indonesia]{.mark}**, **[Malaysia]{.mark}**, **[Cape
Verde]{.mark}**, [and **Argentina**]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n
[interest in **purchasing**]{.mark} similar plants from
**Rosatom**]{.underline}.

[China has also shown **great interest** in this technology
and]{.underline} in May 2014, [the **[China]{.mark}** Atomic Energy
Authority]{.underline} (**[CAEA]{.underline}**) [[signed an
agreement]{.mark} with **Rosatom** [to construct FNPPs for]{.mark}
China's **[offshore islands]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These FNPP are being
built in China but are based on Russian technology. [The China National
Nuclear Corporation]{.underline} ([CNNC]{.underline}) [[included
**FNPPs** in]{.mark} their 13th [**five-year plan** for **innovative
energy**]{.mark} technologies]{.underline}. Similar to Russia, [China is
building these to supply energy reliably to **geographically isolated**
areas that lack **consistent access** to traditional power
sources]{.underline}; specifically, they're meant for distant,
artificial islands in the South China sea. Traditionally, these isolated
regions have been powered by fossil fuels and diesel generators. These
methods are not only insufficient in meeting the demand of the expanding
population but are also environmentally detrimental. However,
transmitting cleaner electricity from mainland power sources is
expensive. As such, [[future **offshore** **n**]{.mark}uclear

[We live in an age of great [anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about
**threats to**]{.mark} **global [peace]{.mark} and
stability**]{.underline}. [[Among]{.underline} [these]{.underline}
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} [worries that]{.underline} [**[intense
water-related stresses]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [now showing]{.underline}
[up]{.underline} in regions around the world, [may]{.underline}
[become]{.underline} all-too-common **[sources of
conflict]{.underline}**. Just as often, however, concerns about water
wars are dismissed as much ado about nothing. An [influential [school of
thought]{.mark} has long [contended]{.mark}]{.underline} future
international [[conflicts **will not be**]{.mark}
**fought**]{.underline} [over this resource]{.underline}. Water, it
says, is of such elemental importance to human existence that even
long-time adversaries will be forced to accommodate one another's needs
in a water-scarce future. As water is too expensive to transport over
long distances, moreover, it is very difficult to steal or plunder. And
history gives some comfort to this forecast: as few wars have been
fought specifically over water, it is highly unlikely humanity will
start engaging in water conflicts now. Or so the thinking goes.

In the case of water, [[this]{.mark} logic]{.underline} --- of the past
as predictor of the future --- [[is]{.mark} compelling and
comforting]{.underline}. [But it also is]{.underline} **[dangerously
[myopic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [for it [fails to consider]{.mark} the
possibility that the **future may look nothing at all like the
past**]{.underline}. From nearly any standpoint, [the world we live in
is a fundamentally different]{.underline} [place]{.underline}
[compared]{.underline} [with the past.]{.underline} [Over]{.underline}
just [the last century]{.underline}, for example, [the **[global
population]{.mark} has [rocketed]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[upward]{.underline} [from]{.underline} roughly [two billion
to]{.underline} well past [seven billion]{.underline}. While [population
growth is hardly the only driver of]{.underline} social, economic, and
ecological [change]{.underline} [at global]{.underline} and regional
[scale]{.underline}, it has been among the most important. Nor is this
process at an end. Current demographic projections forecast a global
population of at least nine billion by 2050 --- and possibly more.

Water in the Anthropocene:

[Population growth]{.underline} [provides a fitting]{.underline}
[illustration of the rapid pace]{.underline} [of change]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} modern [world]{.underline}. No
consequence is more important than what has been done to nature. Humans
have so drastically altered the Earth that scientists now question
whether we remain in the Holocene, the 12,000-year-old geological epoch
during which all of recorded human history has occurred. Instead,
increasingly they speak of the Earth as having entered a new epoch, the
Anthropocene. The basic idea behind the Anthropocene is that human
activity has so thoroughly disrupted the Earth's core processes (for
instance, its nitrogen cycle or sediment flows) that the planet no
longer can be said to function according to the familiar rhythms of the
Holocene. Human interference in the Earth's carbon cycle, for example,
has changed the planet's climate and in the process altered rainfall
patterns, accelerated glacial melting, increased air and sea
temperatures, and much else. Gone is the Holocene's stable climate; here
is the Anthropocene's unstable one.

While there is some debate amongst scientists and others about whether
the Anthropocene will lead to a better or worse future, nearly everyone
involved in the discussion agrees that the Earth of the future will not
resemble its past. From here forward, we face an unfamiliar planet that
will throw our assumptions about nearly everything out the window.

**[[No resource]{.mark} stands to be [more
affected]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} arrival of the [[Anthropocene]{.underline} [than fresh
water]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Finite]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
increasingly [scarce in many parts of the world]{.underline}, fresh
[[water]{.mark} remains the most [vital]{.mark}]{.underline} single
[input]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} everything]{.underline} [from
**[food]{.mark} production**]{.underline}, **[[energy]{.mark}
generation]{.underline}**, [and **manufacturing**]{.underline} to human
health, social development, [and [economic]{.mark}
modernization]{.underline}. Unlike oil, **[water has [no
substitute]{.mark}]{.underline}**, making access to it nothing less than
a matter of existential importance to every living creature on Earth.

Yet despite its monumental role in local and international affairs,
water ironically remains completely undervalued, pumped and consumed
virtually free of charge across much of the world. We essentially pump
water as we breathe oxygen; it is a learned reflex, central to our
ability to survive and thrive as a species. Nicknames like "blue gold"
and "oil of the 21st century" attest to the value of fresh water and its
importance to everyday affairs throughout the world.

While every country's water equation is different, at a global scale the
basic problem is that demand for water is soaring while water supplies
are being squeezed. On the demand side, [the challenge results
from]{.underline} [an]{.underline} inexorable [combination of global
**economic** and **population** growth]{.underline} combined [with
**water-use inefficiencies**]{.underline}. On the supply side, the
problem results not just from exhaustion of the world's stock of fresh
water capital, as is happening to groundwater reservoirs nearly
everywhere. Fresh water supply is also becoming less predictable as
climate change sets in---shifting rainfall and snowfall patterns and
increasing evaporation rates are giving us more frequent droughts and
floods.

The upshot is that the arrival of the Anthropocene foreshadows a world
where received wisdom may no longer be a reliable guide to the future.
Water insecurity from drought, excessive groundwater extraction, and
changed seasonal precipitation patterns is affecting --- or soon will
affect --- regions as diverse as the Middle East, South Asia, the
Caribbean, northern China, sub-Saharan Africa, the western United
States, and many more.

Water Geopolitics:

Much as oil shaped the global geopolitics of the 20th century,
[[water]{.mark} has the power to **[reorder
i]{.mark}**]{.underline}nternational
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations **[in the current
century]{.underline}**. [The world's emerging]{.underline}
[water]{.underline} [[geopolitics]{.underline} [are
complicated]{.underline}, [as]{.underline}]{.mark} fresh [water
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are]{.underline} **[distributed
unevenly]{.underline}**]{.mark} across the globe. There are great water
powers, blessed [with]{.underline} enormous renewable reserves (Brazil,
Russia, the United States, Canada, and China round out the top five).
But even within these [huge countries]{.underline}, water availability
is not uniform, with southern Brazil, the western United States,
northern China, and other sub-regions [facing **intense water
stress**]{.underline}.

Far more numerous than the water powers are the water have-nots, a
growing list of countries suffering through a perfect storm of rapid
population growth, resource depletion, poor governance, economic
stagnation, and unsettling climate change impacts, all within the
context of chronic aridity. The most water-fragile among them are
concentrated in a strategically significant belt stretching from North
Africa across the Middle East and Horn of Africa into Central, South,
and East Asia. It is in these naturally arid or semi-arid countries
where water scarcity has the greatest potential to inflict serious harm.

[Water stress]{.underline} [is **best understood as a precursor to
conflict**]{.underline}. [While]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
environmental security [community generally agrees that water disputes
rarely]{.underline} [leads to]{.underline} interstate
[violence]{.underline}, [the same cannot be said of **intrastate
conflict**]{.underline}. Here, [at the subnational level]{.underline},
water **[[disputes]{.mark} and instability can [trigger violent
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} particularly in situations of
existing social, political, or economic fragility. [Water stress acts as
an accelerant]{.underline}, [increasing]{.underline} the likelihood of
[conflict]{.underline}. Moreover, [water scarcity-fueled
instability]{.underline} [can have **dangerous security
implications**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} wider [geographic
regions.]{.underline}

[Take **Syria**]{.underline} as an example. Between 2006 and 2010, the
country was hit hard by [[drought]{.underline}]{.mark}, which wiped out
rural livelihoods for many and caused significant internal displacement
across the country. Internal displacement in turn [**helped [stir up a
pot]{.mark}** that boiled over into all-out civil war]{.underline} in
Syria, eventually [spreading to Iraq]{.underline}. Over the last two
years, [[ISIS]{.mark} has [viewed water]{.mark}]{.underline} access and
control [[as a **primary**]{.mark} **strategic
[objective]{.mark}**]{.underline} of their campaign, and has
commandeered hydroelectric dams, irrigation canals, reservoirs,
pipelines, and other water infrastructure to cement territorial gains.

[Water has played an important role]{.underline} [in
Yemen's]{.underline} ongoing [collapse]{.underline}. [Decades of
mismanagement]{.underline} [have left the country]{.underline} --- one
of the world's most water-scarce nations --- [with **dilapidated water
infrastructure**]{.underline}, [severely]{.underline} **[depleted
groundwater reserves]{.underline}**, [and high rates of]{.underline}
water-use [inefficiency]{.underline}. Yemen's capital, Sana'a, may
become the first capital in the modern world to functionally run out of
water, possibly as soon as 2025.

[In Pakistan,]{.underline} [meanwhile]{.underline}, runaway [population
growth and **shifting rainfall patterns**]{.underline}
[threaten]{.underline} [its water outlook]{.underline}.
[With]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [massive population]{.underline} [set
to]{.underline} nearly [double]{.underline} in the next 35 years,
[Pakistan's demand]{.underline} on its very limited water resources
[will intensify]{.underline} in a way that is almost unimaginable.
Already, the country is one of the most water scarce on earth. In a nod
to water's importance in shaping the region, [many]{.underline}
Pakistani [militant groups long hostile]{.underline} [to
India]{.underline} [have supplanted protests]{.underline} [over Indian
control of Kashmir]{.underline} [with more]{.underline} specific
[protests over access to]{.underline} Kashmir's most valuable resource
--- [water]{.underline}.

Other countries join Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Pakistan on the list of
nations facing a similar combination of water stress and social and
political insecurity. They include conflict-prone countries of
geopolitical significance, including Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya,
Nigeria, and Somalia. Even more worrisome, [**global heavyweights** such
as China]{.underline}, [India]{.underline}, [and even the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [face]{.underline}
**[uncomfortable futures]{.underline}** given mismatches between
forecasted demand for water and squeezed sources of supply. While there
is no reason to believe that the latter states will suffer from the same
forms of insecurity as those countries in the arc of crisis, neither
will they be exempted from the blunt realities of a water-stressed
world.

American Leadership in the Anthropocene:

In 2012, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
produced a global water security assessment, a first for the American
intelligence community. Over the coming decade, it said, [many countries
would face water stresses]{.underline} [that "will **risk instability
and state failure**]{.underline}, [increase]{.underline} regional
[tensions]{.underline}, and distract them from working with the United
States on important U.S. policy objectives." It listed water-induced
stressors that likely would unsettle these states and their neighbors,
ranging from pressures on food and energy production to social and
political disruption to water scarcity used by terrorists for leverage.

3.2 Lagrangian Experiments

3.2.1 Arctic Circulation Pathways and Time Scales

In [order to assess the advective pathways likely to be important for an
Arctic]{.underline} oil [spill]{.underline}, Lagrangian [particles were
released from 15 sites along the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}.
Releases were performed every 10 days from May to October, from 1990 to
2009. Examples of trajectories from each site are presented in Figure 4,
showing all releases from 2000. Note that reds (corresponding to the
earlier parts of trajectories) are plotted over yellows/greens/blues
from later in the particles\' journeys to highlight the fastest
advective time scales.

\[Image Omitted\]

From Figure 4, the first result that is immediately apparent is that,
depending on where the [[particles]{.mark} were released 1 year [can be
**sufficient to reach**]{.mark} the center of [the Arctic
Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within 2 years [it is possible for them to
leave the Arctic **completely** [and flow into the]{.mark} North
[Atlantic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The spatial scale of these advective
pathways confirms that a pan-Arctic outlook is necessary to understand
the long-term fate of potential oil spills from the NSR.

As is also clear from Figure 4, advective pathways in the Arctic are
highly variable depending on where (and when) Lagrangian "particles" are
released. First, we address the sensitivity to release site. Below we
detail the spread of the particles through different regions of the
Arctic Ocean and Arctic seas:

3.2.1.1 Barents and Kara Releases

The north-eastward flow of the Atlantic Water through the Barents Sea,
the Barents Sea Branch (Aksenov et al., 2010, 2011), is the main
circulation feature, and Lagrangian particles released in the Barents
Sea show this pathway (see Figures 4a and 4b). The particles followed
two main trajectories; (1) eastward flow within the Murmansk Current,
then through the Kara Gate into the Kara Sea, and (2) flow northward of
Novaya Zemlya toward the Eurasian shelf-break within the West Novaya
Zemlya Current, where they flow via the St. Anna Trough and across the
northern Barents Sea shelf into the deep Arctic Ocean (Aksenov et
al., 2010). Trajectories are relatively fast in this part of the Arctic,
with 4--5 month transient times to cross from Murmansk to the Kara Gate.
The trajectories also map the cyclonic gyre in the Central Basin of the
Barents Sea, with some of the particles entrained in the gyre and
following the westward flow toward the Barents Sea Opening (cf.
Figure 4a and Aksenov et al., 2010).

As in the Barents, northward and eastward currents dominate in the Kara
Sea (Figures 4c--4e). The particles released in the Kara Sea travel via
the St. Anna Trough in the Nansen and Amundsen basins of the Arctic
Ocean (Dmitrenko et al., 2015), and also via the Vilkitsky Strait
Current into the Vilkitsky Strait and the western Laptev Sea (Janout et
al., 2015). There is an episodic flow back from the Kara Sea through the
Kara Gate into the Barents Sea. This is the Litke Current, observed on
some occasions (Pfirman et al., 1997), and found to be correlated with
an atmospheric sea level pressure gradient across Novaya Zemlya between
the Barents and Kara Seas, and by seasonal variations in the buoyant
eastward current at the southern end of the Kara Gate.

After leaving the St. Anna Trough, particles go on to follow the
Eurasian shelf-break within the Shelf-Break Current (SBC). This is one
of the cores of eastward flow, guided by topography Arctic Circumpolar
Boundary Current (ACBC; Aksenov et al., 2011), and along the rest of
their trajectories subduction down the shelf slope was seen to occur
(Figures 4c--4e). From there, particles recirculate in the Nansen and
Amundsen basins (Figures 4e and 4f), eventually heading to exit the
Arctic Ocean via the western part of Fram Strait toward the Atlantic.
Very few particles released in the Kara Sea reach the Atlantic within
the 2 years studied.

3.2.1.2 Laptev, East-Siberian and Chukchi Releases

Lagrangian particles released on the Laptev Sea shelf depict the
well-established circulation pattern: they flow toward the shelf slope,
where they can follow one of two routes: the ACBC or the Transpolar
Drift Current (hereafter Transpolar Drift) from Siberia to the Fram
Strait (Aksenov et al., 2011; Dmitrenko et al., 2005; Janout et
al., 2015; Newton et al., 2008) (see Figures 4f--4i). Trajectories
following the ACBC are strongly guided by the seabed topography of the
Arctic, and branch away from the shelf-break at the Lomonosov Ridge
(Woodgate et al., 2001). Here they join the Transpolar Drift and flow
toward the Atlantic. [Particles released from all sites around the
Laptev Sea are able to reach the Atlantic Ocean **within 2
years**.]{.underline}

Trajectories in the East-Siberian Sea are notably slower than those in
other shelf seas (see Figure 4l in particular). Currents in the area
vary in time and space, and the particles are carried in all directions,
owing to oppositely directed inflowing waters from the Laptev Sea on one
side (which carries particles east when it dominates) and the Chukchi on
the other (which carries particles west) (Timmermans et al., 2014).
Particles from the East-Siberian Sea remain on the shelf for a
considerable time, typically beyond a year. Once these trajectories
enter the central Arctic Basin, the Transpolar Drift is the principal
pathway.

Circulation in the Chukchi Sea is driven by inflow from the Pacific and
by the wind (Aksenov et al., 2016; Timmermans et al., 2014). The
majority of particles in our experiments follow Pacific Water pathways,
of which three main routes are noted: (1) the western route into the
Chukchi Sea through the Herald Canyon, (2) the eastern route via the
shelf-break jet through the Barrow Canyon and along the Alaskan
Shelf-break (Appen & Pickart, 2012) and (3) the route across the shelf
crossing the Herald Shoal and the Hanna Shoal via the Central Channel
(Timmermans et al., 2014). Trajectories originating in the Chukchi Sea
can become entrained into the Beaufort Gyre within 2 years. This is
illustrated in Figures 4m--4o. Further detail of the variability of
these pathways is discussed in section 3.2.5.

3.2.2 Distance Traveled

As a first-order metric, we are interested in how far particles go. The
mean distances (across all experiments) traveled by particles from each
launch site is presented below in Table 1. The distances traveled after
9 months and after 2 years are presented, both as direct A-B and the
total length of the path traveled for each of the 15 release sites used,
listed from west to east. The full path is a proxy for average current
speed along a trajectory, whereas the A-B distance represents how far
away from the initial spill site a recovery operation would need to
consider.

\[Table Omitted\]

From Table 1, the distance traveled shows only modest sensitivity
release site when the full path length is considered. All sites fall
within 300 km of the mean distance traveled (1,497 km) across all sites
for the first 9 months of advection: i.e., particles are transported at
approximately the same speed regardless where they are seeded from.

However, this is not the case when considering the direct A to B
distance (calculated as the shortest distance along the surface of the
Fischer Spheroid) for each site. Excluding the Bering Strait, particles
starting from release sites at the west of the Northern Sea Route
traveled significantly further (typically about twice as far) as those
from the eastern end of the NSR (excluding the Bering Strait site, which
was more in line with the western sites).

Here the cutoff between west and east was the boundary between the
Laptev and East-Siberian Seas. Particles originating from the Barents,
Kara and Laptev seas traveled on average 771 km in nine months and 1,454
km in 2 years, whereas those from the East-Siberian Sea (including New
Siberian Islands and Sannikov Strait release sites) and Chukchi sea
(excluding Baring Strait site) traveled an average of 382 km in nine
months and 834 km in 2 years.

[The marked difference in A-B distance despite the similar total path
distance demonstrates that [particles launched]{.mark} toward the west
of the route (and also in the Bering Strait) follow more direct routes,
whereas those in the east [are more prone to
recirculation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

3.2.3 Advective Footprints: Horizontal Spread and Uncertainty

We now characterize the horizontal spread of particles. This is done by
dividing the ocean into a grid (full details in section 2.5) and
counting the total area of occupied grid cells. Here we consider grid
cells that are occupied 9 months after particles were initially
released. Again, 9 months was chosen to represent a typical time between
a spill occurring and the next melt season beginning. In the context of
an oil spill, this corresponds to the area that should be expected to be
reached by potentially contaminated waters.

Each release of 100 particles per release site is considered separately
(so a total of 300 releases per site: 20 years of releases with 15
releases per year) and these are averaged to give a typical release
footprint size for each release site. Particles were initially
distributed over an area of 100 km2. These footprint sizes are presented
below in Table 2.

\[Table Omitted\]

Table 2 shows that the spreading of particles is strongly dependent on
where they are initially released from. There is a clear east/west
divide, with western release sites (1--5) typically producing larger
footprints and central (6--11) and eastern (12--15) ones producing
smaller footprints.

The smallest footprints were associated from the middle of the Northern
Sea Route, around Siberia in the Laptev and East-Siberian Seas
(including the New Siberian Islands and Sannikov Strait release sites
between them). The East-Siberian Sea site produced anomalously small
footprints, on average less than 10,000 km2. The average area for the
other three sites in this group was 27,267 km2 (average standard
deviation 15,518 km2), making them only half the size of the average
footprint area for the remaining 11 release sites.

The five westernmost release sites (Murmansk---Kara Sea) produced the
five largest footprints. The mean area of footprints from these sites
was 67,866 km2 (average standard deviation 10,665 km2); 48% bigger than
the average for the other release sites, excluding the anomalously small
footprint from the East-Siberian Sea release site. Including all sites
between Murmansk and the Vilkitsky Strait, the average area of
footprints from the west of the NSR was 61,361 km2 (average standard
deviation 12,317 km2).

Considering each of the 300 releases from each of the 15 releases sites,
the average area of advective footprints 9 months after particles were
releases was 45,762 km2 (average standard deviation 13,307 km2).
Excluding the five largest and four smallest sites highlighted, the
typical area of a footprint was 44,161 km2 (average standard deviation
15,233 km2).

Additionally, the area of the "envelope" surrounding all 300 footprints
from each site (again after 9 months) was calculated, i.e., the total
area affected by at least one release. While the first metric addresses
how waters from a particular release spread, this metric addresses part
of the uncertainty in where they will go. [As with the individual
footprints, western [release sites were]{.mark} [found to have the
largest "envelopes"]{.mark} while the smallest were in and around the
East-Siberian Sea. The large footprint "envelopes" in the west were
typically associated with [particles being rapidly entrained]{.mark}
into a well-organized current (the ACBC), which [enabled them to travel
further]{.mark} (see Table 1) and hence produce a larger envelope than
particles which stay closer to their release sites.]{.underline}

Finally, we calculate the ratio of the "individual footprints" and the
"envelopes." This demonstrates that the uncertainty in where spilled oil
could go (the envelope) is an order of magnitude larger than the area
over which contaminated waters would be expected to spread (the
individual footprints). This ratio provides a measure of the variability
of advective pathways from a given site: larger ratios correspond to
footprints with less overlap between experiments, suggesting more
variable circulation. [The combination of the especially large envelope
and ratio from the Severnaya Zemlya site is partly due to the highly
variable circulation around this area---discussed further in
section 3.2.5.]{.underline} The largest ratio was produced by the
East-Siberian Sea releases, but it should be noted that this was due to
both an abnormally small envelope and individual footprints, which stay
relatively close to their initial release site.

3.2.4 Subduction

Having addressed the horizontal spread of our particles, we now look in
the vertical direction. It is important to note that we are only
considering subduction due to advection, as our Lagrangian technique
does not explicitly include convection. All particles were initially
released at the ocean surface, but they were not constrained to stay
there. Here we investigate the fraction of particles which sink below
100 m depth. [This was chosen as a rough approximation for the depth of
the upper mixed layer, as any [oil entrained deeper into]{.mark} the
[water]{.mark} column [will be]{.mark} especially difficult to
recover/[unrecoverable]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [**growing scarcity** of]{.mark} clean [water **is**]{.mark}
**one** of the **[most pressing challenges facing humanity]{.mark}** in
the 21st century. With more than **[2 billion people]{.mark}** living in
water-stressed areas, the [need]{.mark} for **[sustainable]{.mark}** and
[**affordable** solution]{.mark}s has become a [global
**priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context, [[f]{.mark}loating
[n]{.mark}uclear [p]{.mark}ower [p]{.mark}lants have [emerged]{.mark} as
an **[innovative]{.mark}** proposal to [address]{.mark} this
[crisis]{.mark}, combining nuclear technology and desalination to meet
the [demand]{.mark} for **[freshwater]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What are [floating nuclear power plants]{.underline}?

[Floating nuclear power plants are offshore structures that house
**[nuclear reactors]{.mark}** capable of generating electricity and
heat, with the possibility of being used to power adjacent desalination
plants in specific situations of drinking water needs]{.underline}.
These units are transportable and can be [installed in strategic
locations, providing flexibility to address freshwater needs in
different coastal locations]{.underline}.

In its most common form, the desalination process involves removing salt
and other minerals from seawater, converting it into potable freshwater.
[**[Using energy generated]{.mark}** by [nuclear reactors]{.mark},
electricity, and heat are supplied to **[desalination plants]{.mark}**
that [use **methods**]{.mark} such [as **reverse osmosis**]{.mark} or
**[distillation]{.mark}** to [**purify sea**water]{.mark} and
[make]{.mark} it **[suitable]{.mark}** for **[human]{.mark}** and
[agricultural consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Benefits of floating nuclear power plants

Access to drinking water: [These [plants offer]{.mark} the
[**possibility** of]{.mark} an **[additional]{.mark}**, **[sustainable
source]{.mark}** of **[fresh]{.mark}** water in [water-scarce
regions]{.mark}, helping to meet the growing demand for drinking
water]{.underline}.

Energy efficiency: The **[[combination]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
[[nuclear power generation]{.mark} and **[desalination]{.mark}**
provides a [constant]{.mark} and [reliable]{.mark} source of
[energy]{.mark} for the **[water purification
process]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**\<\<\<IMAGE OMMITTED\>\>\>**

Mobility and adaptability: The ability to move these plants to various
coastal locations allows them to serve areas with specific drinking
water needs, including areas affected by natural disasters or
emergencies.

In summary, [[floating]{.mark} nuclear power [plants
**represent**]{.mark} a **[technological innovation]{.mark}** with the
**[potential]{.mark}** to [address **two global issues**]{.mark}
simultaneously: **[freshwater scarcity]{.mark}** and **[energy
demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With a [[holistic approach]{.mark} that
considers both the **[benefits]{.mark}** and the associated challenges,
these facilities [could play a]{.mark} **[crucial role]{.mark}** in the
sustainable **[fresh water supply worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In terms of facilities or projects under development, it is [relevant to
mention that some countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi
Arabia, India, and some **[nations]{.mark}** with coastal areas prone to
water scarcity [have shown **interest**]{.mark} in the
[possibility]{.mark} of implementing [f]{.mark}loating [n]{.mark}uclear
[p]{.mark}ower [p]{.mark}lants [with]{.mark} the [capacity]{.mark} to
[desalinate seawater]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [floating nuclear power plant \"**[Akademik Lomonosov]{.mark}**\"
(Russia)]{.underline} Russia\'s \"Akademik Lomonosov\"
[**[f]{.mark}**loating **[n]{.mark}**uclear **[p]{.mark}**ower
**[p]{.mark}**lant is the [most **prominent example**]{.mark} and is an
[**innovative** project]{.mark} developed by Russia that [marks]{.mark}
a [milestone]{.mark} in **[nuclear technology]{.mark}** and **[power
generation]{.mark}**. It consists of a floating platform equipped with
two KLT-40S type nuclear reactors, similar to those used in Russian
icebreakers, each with an output of 35 MW and water-cooled]{.underline}.
They are located inside a reinforced floating hull, ensuring stability
and safety, even in adverse sea conditions. Akademik Lomonosov can
supply electricity to remote areas and coastal regions where a reliable
and constant supply is needed, and is also capable of powering seawater
desalination facilities if necessary, using part of the energy generated
for this process. Development and background of \"Akademik Lomonosov\":

Construction: Construction of the floating nuclear power plant began in
2007, with assembly at the St Petersburg Shipyard in St Petersburg,
Russia. After several stages of development and testing, it was launched
into the water in 2018. Innovation and potential uses: [This power plant
**[represents]{.mark}** a **[breakthrough]{.mark}** in [nuclear
**technology**]{.mark} and its **[application]{.mark}** in [**maritime**
environments]{.mark}. Its ability to supply power to **[remote]{.mark}**
areas, as well as its potential to desalinate seawater, [make it]{.mark}
a **[versatile]{.mark}** solution for [coastal regions]{.mark} with
**[energy]{.mark}** and **[water needs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Current
operation: Since its launch, the floating nuclear power plant \"Akademik
Lomonosov\" has been operational and has been part of the Russian energy
system, providing electricity to areas in northern Russia, including the
city of Pevek in the Chukotka region.

[Prodigy Clean Energy and Serco have announced progress on a
prototypical **test program** demonstrating the **robustness**
of]{.underline} Prodigy's [Transportable Nuclear Power
Plants]{.underline} (**[TNPPs]{.underline}**) [to resist **accidental**
and **threat scenarios**]{.underline}.

Prodigy had received a \$2,750,000 award from the Canadian government
under the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) enabling SMRs program.

The effort is intended towards generating critical data needed to
support licensing and public engagement, as Prodigy prepares TNPPs to
enter commercialization by 2030.

Viable nuclear power is greatly sought out by countries across the world
today; however, the cost of building a power plant is quite high.

Prodigy says that its [method of packaging small modular
reactors]{.underline} (**[SMRs]{.underline}**) [and microreactors into
prefabricated and relocatable power plant structures is a **good
move**]{.underline}. These can be standardized to deploy nuclear power
safely and securely in various environments, as per the company.

Prodigy's nuclear power offerings

The company says that it will manufacture the TNPPs in a factory
setting, and from there, the nuclear power plant will be brought to the
deployment site in a fully assembled condition.

The company believes this will reduce capital costs by a great margin
and will also cut down the delivery timeline to a larger extent, when
compared to a traditional site-built nuclear power plant.

It also gives the customers a chance to use the SMRs or microreactors of
their liking, depending on the power needs and type of energy output
(electric or thermal) needed. Prodigy says that multiple modules can be
packed into a TNPP to provide output ranging from 5 MWe to 1 GWe.

The TNPPs will have a 60-year life, following which they will be taken
to a facility for decommissioning and recycling.

The firm is developing two types of TNPPs in collaboration with various
SMR developers. The first is a microreactor power station, TNPP, which
will be deployed at the shoreline within a protected harbor. This can
also be transferred onto land in coastal areas for deployment in remote
regions.

The second is a [marine power station]{.underline}, which [will have a
greatly reduced **concrete footprint**]{.underline}. The company says
[it can also be **safely deployed** in seismically **active** and
**volatile regions**]{.underline}.

Partnership with Serco and Lloyd's Register

The [recent partnership with Serco aims to test its 360-degree layered
**countermeasures** to secure the nuclear power plant from **air**,
**land**, and **water**]{.underline}.

"Prodigy is completing the real work needed to bring TNPPs to market in
North America on schedule. [Our technologies are now at a **suitable
level** of **readiness** to engage sophisticated partners in detailed
**engineering exercises**]{.underline}. Serco's world-class expertise
ensures that Prodigy achieves its top priority -- that [facilities
operate safely and **securely**, **safeguarding** and protecting **local
communities** and the **environment**]{.underline}," said Mathias
Trojer, President and CEO of Prodigy Clean Energy.

5.4. [**Layout** of the equipment in the
**[Lagoon]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The proposed layout is schematically shown in Fig. 2.

The scheme shows an 800-m diameter artificial lagoon with three reactors
in the centre. Each of these supplies steam to drive its own turbine
which is mounted on a rectangular shape platform.

The area within the lagoon is about 50 hectares. This is area is able to
accommodate five or more FNPPs. For clarity we show 3 units of 300MWe
SMRs. (Westinghouse 225MWe SMR by comparison requires a footprint of
about 6 hectares.) Armoured high tension submarine cables are used to
deliver power to land.

Spent fuel rods on land based nuclear plants are normally kept in a
spent fuel pool for up to several years. The depth of such pools are
about 12 meters deep. The [water around the fuel rods [acts as a]{.mark}
moderator as well as a [medium for dissipating
heat]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the proposed FNPP, [the [spent **fuel
rods**]{.mark} are [kept in **concrete casks**]{.mark} and lowered by
**crane** into designated locations [in the **lagoon**]{.mark} where it
may remain [until there is **sufficient quantity** for]{.mark}
**economic [removal]{.mark}** or **recycling**]{.underline}.

\[Text Condensed, None Omitted\]

Removal of spent fuel if necessary, can be performed by marine vessels
instead of using trucks or train wagons overland. The former is
obviously a safer practice. The US Department of Energy, issued a
statement in October 2022, that states, among other things, spent fuels
may be recycled. According to a statement in October 2022issued by the
US Office of Nuclear Energy, "the US generates about 2,000 tons of spent
fuel each year." This volume just about fills half the volume of an
Olympic size swimming pool. ".... the clean energy generated from this
fuel would be enough to power more than 70 million homes--- avoiding
more than 400 million metrics tons of carbon dioxide emissions."
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) "the total
amount of spent fuel generated worldwide in the 52-year history of
civilian nuclear power is over 276 000 tHM, (tons of Heavy Metals), of
which roughly one third has been reprocessed, leaving around 190 000 tHM
of spent fuel, mostly in wet storage pools but with an increasing amount
in dry storage." Cooling storage pools that were designed based on a
reactor life of 40 years are today inadequate with life extension of
reactors. The capacity of these spent fuel cooling pool is a limiting
factor. There is also a risk that the pool may have become structurally
unsound. If water in these pool leaks the decay heat may cause the spent
fuel to overheat. In the proposed lagoon the risk of inadequate cooling
water does not arise. Depending on operating procedure, about a third of
the fuel rods are replaced every twelve months, In the proposed concept
replacement of spent fuel rods with new ones is carried out within the
lagoon. The fuel rod assembly is removed with the aid of floating cranes
and lowered on to the floating workshop which is equipped with overhead
travelling cranes and all the necessary tools to extract the fuel rods
and fit new ones. In addition to servicing the reactor, the floating
workshop is also equipped and manned to carry out examination,
maintenance and repair of steam pipes, rotary machines including the
steam turbines, alternators and transformers. Fig. 2, shows three SMRs
clustered in the centre of the lagoon. Not all units need necessarily to
be installed from the start. Each is added when power demand approaches
capacity. Each reactor is connected to its associated turbine hall
complex, and transmission systems. The Office of Nuclear Energy on 16
April 2020 reports "As the average age of American reactors approaches
40 years old, experts say there are no technical limits to these units
churning out clean and reliable energy for an additional 40 years or
longer." As the life span of the turbo-generator is about one third of
that of the reactor, the turbo-generator equipment has to undergo
replacement at least twice in the life cycle of the SMR. The floating
crane would be a handy equipment for the removal the retired generator
assembly and for installation of new ones. The entire refurbishment
operation can be performed within the lagoon. The FNPP has to be located
in the host/owner country's territorial sea or within its Exclusive
Economic Zone, away as far as practicable, from shipping lanes. A
barrage is constructed around the FNPP thus making a lagoon around it.
The barrage can be designed as GBS, (gravity-based structures.). The
manufacturing of these GBS caisson can be carried out in some remote
location where launching can be performed by a launching barge a
shiplift or pneumatic tubes. Reference may be made to the Tuas Mega Yard
where videos of such GBS fabrication (note this is on a much larger
scale) are accessible at YouTube. {Search Completion of Tuas Port Phase
2 Caissons Fabrication.} However, the lagoon may also be enclosed using
rocks as revetment if these are readily available. The elevation of the
crest of the barrage needs to consider potential surges at the location.
The crest doubles up as a recreational feature when landscaped plants
and benches. The barrage is permeable. Water passes through it so that
the water level inside and outside is nearly the same throughout the
tidal cycle. This also minimises the lateral hydrostatic pressure on it.
The circular structure is highly resilient to external forces that may
arise in the event of a tsunami. The passage of currents and waves
through the barrage also reduces their kinetic energy. If the site is
windy, a wind turbine may be erected to reduce its impact on the
structures in the lagoon as well as to harvest its energy. The depth of
the lagoon varies from about 5 meters at the side to 20 or 30 meters at
the centre and its diameter from 500 to 800 meters. The depth at the
centre is designed to suit the size of the reactor. The dimensions are
subject to specific conditions at the site. The depth at the periphery
is kept shallow to reduce hydrostatic uplift as well as to keep cost
low. Provisions for potential uplift due to a wave surge in the lagoon
needs to be considered in the design of the GBS. Additional ballast in
the form of scrap metals may be added to increase the negative buoyancy,
i.e. to prevent an uplift. The barrage incorporates two gates, one large
and one small. The SMR is barged through a larger gate in the barrage
with tug boats. The larger gate may be designed as a gravity-based
structure that can be floated by deballasting. This option is slow but
safe and feasible because it does not require frequent opening. The
smaller gate is used by smaller boats to transport maintenance parts to
and from the power plant. It has a sill at a suitable elevation and is
operated mechanically by electric winches. The assets have to be manned
round the clock so the adequate facilities have to be provided in close
proximity to the lagoon for staff on shifts. Accommodation with rest and
recreation facilities are available in the form of a floating hotel
moored outside the lagoon. This would be similar in quality and capacity
to the "floatels" typically used in the offshore oil and gas industry.
Depending on its distance from shore crew members may number from 200 to
500 people. It is selfsufficient in terms of water, provisions, and
healthcare. A detailed description of the facilities fitted out in
typical floating accommodation can be found in Wikipedia under the
heading Accommodation Platform. The IEA conducted some studies on the
staffing requirements of SMRs on a staff strength per MWe matrix. The
results vary. This is not surprising as designs and work environments
are not identical. The floating accommodation option allows for
additional units to be added to the complex as and when necessary. 6.
SECURITY A CRITICAL FEATURE The security of a sovereign nation's energy
supply chain is paramount and deserves the utmost attention. The blowing
up of the Nord Stream pipelines is ample lesson that nothing, least of
all security can be taken for granted. When a critical infrastructure is
based far from the shores of its host country and expose to geopolitical
threat all practical measures must be put in place The lagoon concept is
distinctively superior in addressing such concerns. In the open sea
intrusion detection is easier. The first line of defence in the scheme
presented here is detection and warning. Light house and military grade
lasers to warn and searchlight to detect any suspicion of covert
intrusions. The second line of defence are radars, and surface and
underwater drones with camera and transmission capabilities. They
transmit data 24x7 to the coast guards of unfriendly or unidentified
intrusions. The third line of defence is intervention with weaponised
autonomous boats and aircrafts to immobilise intruders who choose not to
disclose their identity. The last line of defence is boots on the
barrage. No boats can pass through the massive structure except with
security clearance the either gates. The barrage is designed to be
robust enough to take any impact from a range of vessels including ocean
going ships. We believe a floating NPP in the sea surrounded by a
barrage can be adequately protected from natural and geopolitical
threats.

7\. A MULTIPURPOSE LAGOON

Although the lagoon is primarily designed to protect and secure the
FNPP, it offers opportunities for incorporating other uses with marginal
cost.

As mentioned earlier it is an ideal place to stock spent fuel and new
fissile material. [The [lagoon doubles]{.mark} up [as a]{.mark} massive
[**cooling pond** and]{.mark} a **[radioactive shield]{.mark}** for
**spent fuel**]{.underline}. [The spent fuel, contained in casks and can
remain there for the **life** of the **reactors**]{.underline}.

Maintenance is performed in the lagoon onboard a floating full-service
workshop.

As a desalination facility. Potable water will be a critical global
issue in future as sea water infiltrate coastal areas and as rivers and
lakes run dry. The demand on the electrical output will vary daily.
[**[Excess]{.mark}** electrical **[energy]{.mark}** during off peak
hours may be tapped to **[desalinate sea water]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The [desalinated water is [**stored** in a **tanker**]{.mark} berthed
outside the lagoon in which it may be **[transported]{.mark}** to
[**onshore** for **consumption**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Direct conversion of seawater into green hydrogen is an evolving
technology. The lagoon would be a good place to locate such energy
intensive asset. Because of the high security it would provide a
location for safe keeping digital data. Google has already filed a
patent for water-based data centre. The barrage crest provides space for
mounting unobstructed military surveillance devices to enhance national
defence.

5.3. Lagoon

A Floating Nuclear Power Plant ([FNPP]{.underline}) complex has the
advantage that new [units may be added virtually on a plug and play
basis to increase output for a region over a time frame of
decades]{.underline}. [This enables the output to be increased
incrementally without interrupting the operation of existing
plants]{.underline}.

Conversely [it may be [necessary to **relocate**]{.mark} the [plant as
**demand declines**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. as when industries move
out from the grid) [during its 60-year life span. This is only possible
[if the structure is **floating**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Its
decommissioning with the aid of [tugboats is **pollution free**]{.mark}
leaving no trace behind. [In an]{.mark} (unlikely)
**[emergency]{.mark}**, [the reactor may be **towed
out**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Unlike reactors using rivers for its
cooling water, a **[FNPP]{.mark}** in the sea [will **never** experience
a **water shortage**]{.mark} in a prolonged drought]{.underline}.
Reactors up to 300MWe may be assembled indoors. Their size and weight
enable it to be transported by barge from the factory to its designated
site by passing populated areas.

[It may be installed in a [**concrete** structure]{.mark} designed with
a high degree of stability to support its **weight** and external
**environmental forces**]{.underline}. [Concrete]{.underline}, unlike
steel, [[requires **little maintenance**]{.mark} during the life of the
plant]{.underline}. [Its [mass]{.mark} adds **inertia** to [improve
**stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the environmental front,
[submerged concrete structures are [**friendly** to **marine
life**]{.mark}, [providing **natural habitats** and refuge for
**corals**]{.mark}, **[barnacles]{.mark}** and bi-valves, sea slugs [and
**algae**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[**[S]{.mark}**mall **[m]{.mark}**odular
**[r]{.mark}**eactor**[s]{.mark}** [offer]{.mark} a **[lower]{.mark}**
initial capital **[investment]{.mark}**, greater
**[scalability]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} siting **[flexibility]{.mark}**
for locations unable to **accommodate** more traditional larger
reactors. They also have the potential for enhanced **safety** and
**security** compared to earlier designs. Deployment of advanced SMRs
can help drive **economic growth**]{.underline}. The term "modular" in
the context of SMRs refers to the ability to fabricate major components
of the nuclear steam supply system in a factory environment and ship to
the point of use. Even though current large nuclear power plants
incorporate factory-fabricated components (or modules) into their
designs, a [**substantial** amount of field **work** is still required
to assemble **components** into an operational power plant.
**[SMRs]{.mark}** are envisioned to require limited on-site preparation
and substantially **[reduce]{.mark}** the lengthy **[construction
times]{.mark}** that are [typical of]{.mark} the [**larger**
units]{.mark}. SMRs [provide **simplicity**]{.mark} of design, enhanced
**[safety]{.mark}** features, the [**economics** and quality]{.mark}
afforded by factory production, and more **flexibility** (financing,
siting, sizing, and end-use applications) compared to **larger** nuclear
power plants]{.underline}. Additional modules can be added incrementally
as demand for energy increases. [SMRs can **[reduce]{.mark}** a nuclear
plant owner's [capital **investment**]{.mark} due to the [lower]{.mark}
plant capital [cost]{.mark}]{.underline}. Modular components and
[factory fabrication can reduce construction costs and
duration]{.underline}.

[SMRs can [provide **power**]{.mark} for applications where [large
**plants**]{.mark} are not needed or sites lack the infrastructure to
[support]{.mark} a **[large unit]{.mark}**. This would include
**[smaller]{.mark}** electrical markets, isolated areas, smaller grids,
sites with [**limited** water]{.mark} and acreage, or unique industrial
applications]{.underline}. SMRs are expected to be attractive options
for the replacement or repowering of aging/retiring fossil plants, or to
provide an [option for complementing existing industrial processes or
power plants with an energy source that does not emit greenhouse
gases]{.underline}.

[SMRs can be **[coupled]{.mark}** with **[other energy]{.mark}**
sources, including [renewables]{.mark} and [fossil]{.mark} energy, to
leverage **[resources]{.mark}** and produce higher
**[efficiencies]{.mark}** and multiple energy end-products while
increasing grid stability and **[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some
advanced SMR designs can produce a higher temperature process heat for
either electricity generation or industrial applications.

[SMR designs have the distinct **[advantage]{.mark}** of factoring in
current **[safeguards]{.mark}** and [**security** requirements]{.mark}.
Facility protection systems, including barriers that can withstand
design basis aircraft crash scenarios and other [specific
**threats**]{.mark}, are part of the engineering process being
[applied]{.mark} to new **[SMR design]{.mark}**. SMRs also [provide
**safety**]{.mark} and potential **[nonproliferation]{.mark}** benefits
to the United States and the wider [**international**
community]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most SMRs will be built below grade for
safety and security enhancements, addressing vulnerabilities to both
sabotage and natural phenomena hazard scenarios. Some SMRs will be
designed to operate for extended periods without refueling. These SMRs
could be fabricated and fueled in a factory, sealed and transported to
sites for power generation or process heat, and then returned to the
factory for defueling at the end of the life cycle. This approach could
help to minimize the transportation and handling of nuclear material.
Light water-based SMRs are expected to be fueled with low enriched
uranium, i.e., approximately 5 percent U-235, similar to existing large
nuclear power plants. The "security by design" concepts being applied to
these technologies are expected to increase SMR resistance to theft and
diversion of nuclear material. Also, reactor cores for these light water
SMRs can be designed to burn plutonium as a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel.
Further, SMRs based on non-light water reactor coolants could be more
effective at dispositioning plutonium while minimizing the wastes
requiring disposal.

[The case for [SMR]{.mark} economic [competitiveness]{.mark} is
[rooted]{.mark} in the concept that **[mass manufacture]{.mark}** of
[**modular** parts]{.mark} and components will [reduce]{.mark} the
[c]{.mark}ost [p]{.mark}er [k]{.mark}ilowatt [of **electricity**]{.mark}
on par with current **[generating sources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There
is both a domestic and international market for SMRs, and U.S. industry
is well positioned to compete for these markets. [[DOE hopes]{.mark}
that the **[development]{.mark}** of **[standardized SMR]{.mark}**
designs will also [result]{.mark} in an [**increased** presence]{.mark}
of U.S. companies in the global energy market. If a sufficient number of
SMR [units]{.mark} were **[ordered]{.mark}**, it would [provide]{.mark}
the necessary **[incentive]{.mark}** to [develop]{.mark} the
**[appropriate]{.mark}** factory capacity to further [grow
**domestic**]{.mark} and [**international** sales]{.mark} of SMR power
plants]{.underline}.

[[SMR **deployment**]{.mark} to **[replace]{.mark}** retiring
electricity generation [assets]{.mark} and meet growing generating needs
would [result]{.mark} in significant **[growth]{.mark}** in domestic
**[manufacturing]{.mark}**, **[tax]{.mark}** base, and high-paying
**[factory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, construction and operating jobs. [A
2010\[1\] study on economic and employment impacts of SMR deployment
estimated that a prototypical 100 MWe SMR costing \$500 million to
manufacture and install would create nearly **7,000 jobs** and generate
\$**1.3 billion** in sales]{.underline}, \$404 million in earnings
(payroll), and \$35 million in indirect business taxes. [The report
examines these impacts for multiple SMR deployment rates, i.e., low (1-2
units/year), moderate (30 units/year), high (40 units/year), and
disruptive (85 units/year). The study indicates **[significant economic
impact]{.mark}** would be realized by [developing]{.mark} an SMR
manufacturing enterprise at even [**moderate deployment**
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Realist Approach to the Future of Nuclear Power," Information Technology
and Innovation Foundation, 4-14-2025,

\-\--nws

[If **[nuclear power]{.mark}** is the **[future]{.mark}**, small modular
reactors (**[SMRs]{.mark}**) are [the **pathway**]{.mark}, potentially
offering a [flexible]{.mark}, [scalable]{.mark},
always-[available]{.mark}, potentially [cost-effective]{.mark} means of
generating clean **[energy]{.mark}**. U.S. companies are currently at
the [cutting edge]{.mark} of SMR **[development]{.mark}** and
[deployment]{.mark}, but **[competition]{.mark}** from China, Russia,
South Korea, and certain European companies [is
**intensifying**]{.mark}. For SMRs to achieve widespread adoption, they
must eventually [reach **price**]{.mark} and [performance
**parity**]{.mark}]{.underline} (P3) with [conventional [energy
**sources**]{.mark}, especially [fossil **fuels**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
And to do that, they need to scale. Unlike large reactors, initially
high [[SMR costs]{.mark} may **[fall]{.mark}** because they are
[designed]{.mark} to be [built]{.mark}---partly or
completely---[in]{.mark} a [factory]{.mark}, rather than **constructed**
on-site]{.underline}. Large-scale factory production can exploit
economies of scale and can also lead to faster production, another key
advantage. That is the endgame for SMRs. [The question is
**[how]{.mark}** to [get **there**]{.mark}, and the role the [**U.S.
government should** play along the **way**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's
useful to think of technology development as following a four-phase
pathway, although, of course, all the boundaries are fuzzy, and not all
technologies go through all four phases: ▪ Initial basic and applied
research eventually leads to a prototype or the equivalent. ▪ Testing
and further development leads to a fully complete design whose
components have been successfully tested. ▪ First-of-a-kind deployment
demonstrates that the protype and related components can be scaled up to
commercial size, and the first reactor of its kind can be built. ▪
During the scale-up phase, multiple copies are produced and sold,
allowing costs to fall and eventually the technology to become
competitive with existing energy sources.

Scale-up requires finally settling on a design, developing a fully
functioning factory, and building an order book deep enough to support
production at scale. [Today, large [reactors]{.mark} have
**[reached]{.mark}** the [scale-up]{.mark} [phase]{.mark} but [have
**largely**]{.mark} stalled **[there]{.mark}**, and show [**no**
sign]{.mark} yet of **[successfully reaching]{.mark}** P3. There are
simply **[not enough orders]{.mark}** in the United States to [generate
**sufficient**]{.mark} scale economies]{.underline}. Proponents hope
that a coalescence of orders around the Westinghouse AP1000 design
(which is now a standard model for large reactors) will get large
reactors to scale, but that seems unlikely. SMRs are at a much earlier
stage, only now reaching the end of the testing and further development
phase, with leading-edge designs preparing for first-of-a-kind
deployment in the United States and elsewhere. As a result, we don't yet
know whether SMRs will crack the scale-up problem; that question cannot
be answered for at least a decade. But we can say that unlike large
reactors, there is a greater possibility that SMRs will indeed scale,
costs will fall, and P3 will be achieved.

[This is in part because **[SMRs]{.mark}** have **[significant
advantages]{.mark}**, including that they may be able to expand the
market for reactors very substantially]{.underline}. Because they can be
[sized from **[1]{.mark}** megawatt (**[MW]{.mark}**) to
**[300]{.mark}** MW or more, they can [meet **very different
needs**]{.mark} in [different markets]{.mark}. Because some designs at
least are well suited to the production of thermal energy, they can play
a role in industrial decarbonization, and could also align well with
desalination]{.underline}. Also, because they are modular, they can be
aggregated to meet the specific amount of energy required. Some designs,
for example those using molten salt and thorium promise cheaper fuel,
lower refueling downtime requirements and have enhanced passive safety
features that further reduce costs. In some cases, [they use
**[different fuels]{.mark}** that are **[less expensive]{.mark}** and
[**easier** to **produce**]{.mark}. [And in contrast]{.mark} to wind and
solar, they generate energy 24/7. That, combined with being
[clean]{.mark}, has attracted **[significant attention]{.mark}** from
Big Tech firms looking for power for their rapidly **[growing data
centers]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**[SMRs]{.mark}** have the [potential provide]{.mark} a low-carbon
[path]{.mark} to meeting our [country's **energy needs**]{.mark}, but
they'll need help from **[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and learning on
the job

**\<\<\<PHOTO OMITTED\>\>\>**

[**[Interest]{.mark}** in small modular nuclear reactors, or
**[SMRs]{.mark}**, is [skyrocketing]{.mark} with tech
**[companies]{.mark}** including [Google]{.mark}, [Amazon]{.mark} and
[Microsoft]{.mark} investing in the [emerging **low-carbon
energy**]{.mark} technology. It has the potential to help these
**[companies]{.mark}** and the [**country** meet]{.mark} their
**[emissions]{.mark}** goals while satisfying growing [**energy**
demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the United States has yet to power up
its first SMR and the technology faces substantial deployment challenges
with its cost and complexity. [Still, [new research]{.mark} from the
**[University]{.mark}** of **[Michigan]{.mark}** shows [that
SMRs]{.mark} are [**economically** viable]{.mark}]{.underline} and
poised to start living up to their potential by 2050. "While expensive
and challenging, SMRs do have the potential to be deployed," said Max
Vanatta, lead author of the new study in the journal Nature Energy.
Vanatta is a doctoral student in U-M's School for Environment and
Sustainability and in the Department of Industrial and Operations
Engineering. "Even though they're expensive, they can still be the
lowest cost option," Vanatta said. [The study predicts that **[enough
SMRs]{.mark}** could be **[deployed]{.mark}** by then [to
**reduce**]{.mark} the country's annual carbon dioxide
[emissions]{.mark} [by]{.mark} up to **[59 million metric
tons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To get there, though, they'll need some
help from the government and the industries building and implementing
the technology. [[Projects]{.mark} not products [One]{.mark} of the
[advantages]{.mark} of nuclear power is that how we end up
[using]{.mark} it is **[very similar]{.mark}** to how we use
**[energy]{.mark}** from **[fossil fuels]{.mark}**. Because of that, it
[**integrates** fairly **seamlessly**]{.mark} with the existing
grid]{.underline}. But nuclear energy also has unique
considerations---so unique that no two nuclear power plants are
completely identical, the researchers said. "Nuclear reactors aren't
products like we think about other technologies," said co-author Robb
Stewart, chief technology officer of Alva Energy. "They're more like
construction projects." For conventional nuclear power plants, those
projects involve several specialized buildings and elements, including
their famous cooling towers.

[The **[net result]{.mark}** in the U.S. is, on average, a plant that
produces about **[1 gigawatt]{.mark}** of electric power, according to
the U.S. Department of Energy. SMRs are still projects, Stewart said,
but smaller ones. They shrink down the reactor to [fit]{.mark} into a
more **[modular design]{.mark}**, which comes at a cost to the
**[maximum]{.mark} [power capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The largest
SMRs produce about 30% the power of an average conventional plant, but
they can be housed in a single building on the site where the power will
be used. In the new study, Vanatta, Stewart and Michael Craig, a U-M
assistant professor in energy systems, considered the deployment of
[**[SMRs]{.mark}** in more than [900 facilities]{.mark} using natural
gas to meet their industrial heating needs. The facilities represented
14 heat-intensive industries, including paper mills, petroleum
refineries and chemical manufacturers. "[**Providing** cheap]{.mark}
enough [heat]{.mark} through low-carbon means is [really
**hard**]{.mark}," Vanatta said. "That's where [SMRs]{.mark} have a
really good **[opportunity]{.mark}**." For its analysis, the team
developed a model to project the [degree]{.mark} and [impact of
**SMR**]{.mark} deployment in these settings in the context of three
**variables**]{.underline}. How to make SMRs competitive One variable
was the cost of natural gas.

The team found that SMRs could compete when natural gas was priced at
\$6 or more per metric million British thermal units, or MMBtu, a
standard unit of measurement for heat content. Although that's not the
lowest number you'll see for the cost of natural gas, it is a realistic
industrial price, Vanatta said. Another variable was how the government
incentivized SMR development through policy. Here, the researchers found
incentives like tax credits and carbon taxes made a huge difference,
while direct subsidies did not. "If you were to just subsidize SMR
development with a \$10 billion pool, build as many modules as you can
for that amount at the cheapest facilities, it still doesn't take off,"
Vanatta said. "Other policies had a very valuable impact. They go a long
way." The final variable was how much the experience of building and
installing an SMR would drive down the cost of future SMR projects. The
team referred to this as learning, and it's a component of the project
that stood out most to Stewart. "That capability of the model makes it a
first of its kind," Stewart said. [The model could thus help bring a
[new]{.mark} [**dimension** to similar **studies**]{.mark} of other
**[technologies]{.mark}**, especially in the low-carbon [energy
**field**,]{.mark} he added. "[There's a lot]{.mark} of
[technology]{.mark} that's just coming out of the **[lab]{.mark}**,"
Stewart said. "Whether that's nuclear or **[battery]{.mark}** storage or
geothermal **[technology]{.mark}**, we're going to want to capture how
the costs evolve from building the first system to the
100th]{.underline}." Historically, there hasn't been much cost-reducing
learning when it comes to conventional nuclear power plants. That's
another consequence of how unique each nuclear project is, Vanatta said.
But he's optimistic the smaller, **[[modular]{.underline}]{.mark}**
designs of [**[SMRs]{.mark}** could help [**buck** that trend]{.mark}.
Even in the [worst-case **scenario**]{.mark}, though, where SMRs
experience negative **[learning]{.mark}** and the cost goes up [between
**projects**]{.mark}, the team still saw **[potential]{.mark}** for
deployment]{.underline}. Still, the researchers stressed how much easier
the path becomes with positive learning. "We need to make sure that
we're capturing that learning and scaling it," Stewart said. "We need to
make sure it doesn't get stuck inside a certain business or utility."
Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, conventional nuclear
plants currently provide the country with about 100 gigawatts of power
capacity. The facilities analyzed by the team could deploy more than an
additional 20 gigawatts in the best-case scenario for SMRs. "It's going
to take everything, but it's all in the service of reliable, low-carbon
energy," Vanatta said.

[In **[remote]{.mark}**, hard-to-reach **[areas]{.mark}** of the
[Russian **Arctic**]{.mark}, a reasonable **[alternative]{.mark}** to
[**energy** sources]{.mark} based on fossil fuel can [be small

place of [use]{.mark} in **[modules]{.mark}**, and completely removed

**[electricity]{.mark}** and [heat supply]{.mark} can be [economically
**efficient**]{.mark} and **[significant]{.mark}** from a
[social]{.mark} and [environmental]{.mark} point of view. The
development of SMRs is [prospective]{.mark} for the development of
hard-to-reach **[territories]{.mark}** with [severe **climatic**
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The relevance of SMR development is
characterized by the Russian power system because the decentralized
power supply zone occupies 70% of the country\'s territory.

[The introduction of [SMR]{.mark} into regional power systems of the
Arctic [will **reduce regional** costs]{.mark} for the [purchase]{.mark}
of [**natural** gas]{.mark} and [fuel oil,]{.mark} increase the
[systemic **reliability**]{.mark} of [power supply]{.mark}, limit the
growth of **[tariffs]{.mark}** for electricity and heat supplied to the
population and [industrial **enterprises**]{.mark}, and improve the
[**environmental** situation]{.mark} in the location area]{.underline}.
The main effect of [using nuclear energy sources is large-[scale
**savings**]{.mark} of **[natural gas]{.mark}** in the field of
[district heating]{.mark} and [heat **supply**]{.mark} in **[large
cities]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[21\]. SMR is the [**[future]{.mark}** of
[nuclear industry **development**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In December of
2020 the state atomic energy corporation Rosatom and the Government of
the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia, have entered into an agreement
that establishes the principles of tariff setting for electricity within
the framework of the project for the construction of an SMR based on the
RITM-200 reactor facility in the settlement of Ust-Kuyga, Ust-Yansky
ulus. [The projected [**SMR** is **distinguished**]{.mark} by its
**[compactness]{.mark}** and **[modularity]{.mark}**, a shortened
construction period and high safety standards, and its service life is
at [least **60 years**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[It is expected that [its **construction**]{.mark} will almost
**[halve]{.mark}** the cost of **[electricity]{.mark}** in the
Ust-Yansky region. In the future, it is possible to establish based on
the station the production of [**environmentally** friendly]{.mark}
[hydrogen]{.mark} for the **[needs]{.mark}** of [transport]{.mark} and
**[industry]{.mark}**. Replacement of obsolete coal and diesel sources
of generation with energy from nuclear power plants will **[reduce CO2
emissions]{.mark}** in the Ust-Yansk region by [**10 thousand** tons per
year]{.mark}]{.underline}. The construction of the station will provide
a stable and clean energy supply for the project for the development of
the Kyuchus gold deposit located in the Verkhoyansk region. The social
effect of SMR construction will be the creation of up to 800 new jobs.
Such projects can serve as a reliable and clean source of heat and
electricity both for subsoil users and for residents of remote areas
with an isolated power system. According to the plan, the construction
of the station will be completed in 2028.

[[interest]{.mark} in small modular reactors (**[SMR]{.mark}**) as
[promising **energy sources**]{.mark} for [remote regions]{.mark} with
decentralized power supply is [**growing** rapidly]{.mark}. This is
justified by the fact that in [difficult Arctic]{.mark}
[conditions]{.mark}, **[traditional]{.mark}** energy sources are [not
able]{.mark} to [meet]{.mark} the growing **[demand]{.mark}** for
**[heat]{.mark}** and **[electric]{.mark}** [energy]{.mark}
everywhere]{.underline} \[1\]. [The [active development]{.mark} of
remote areas with the expansion of gold, diamonds, rare metals, coal,
iron ore **[mining]{.mark}**, the [rise]{.mark} in the production of
**[gas]{.mark}**, and the [development]{.mark} of the processing
industry requires [solving]{.mark} energy [problems]{.mark}. The cost of
**[transmission]{.mark}** of **[electricity]{.mark}** in difficult
[Arctic natural]{.mark} and [climatic conditions]{.mark} and over
**[long distances]{.mark}** can be [several times **higher**]{.mark}
than the **[cost]{.mark}** of its **[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
For such power sources, new generation reactors have been created, which
surpass the existing reactors in terms of reliability and safety. [The
[development]{.mark} of these installations is [based]{.mark} on the
[accumulated experience]{.mark} of leading Russian [nuclear
research]{.mark} and engineering centers in the **[development]{.mark}**
and operation of numerous reactors (inc. propulsion systems) and a
**[powerful]{.mark}** scientific [potential]{.mark} in the field of
solving energy problems]{.underline} \[2\]. The key characteristics that
influence the development of SMRs are:  [**[Compact size]{.mark}** for
remote locations and confined spaces]{.underline}.  [The ability to
[**create** the **required energy**]{.mark} or thermal capacity of SMR,
depending on the customer\'s requirements, by choosing the number of
modules, which reduces the cost and construction time]{.underline}. 
[**[Possibility]{.mark}** of using **[SMR]{.mark}** for **[seawater
desalination]{.mark}** (subject to the installation of additional
equipment) and heat energy production]{.underline}.  [A **[short
construction period]{.mark}** for SMRs in comparison with large NPP. 
**[Low CO2 emission]{.mark}** form of energy]{.underline} \[3\]. 
[**[Minimum volumes]{.mark}** and [cost]{.mark} of capital
construction.]{.underline}  [**[SMR]{.mark}** can operate in the

In general, SMRs are designed for electricity or energy markets where
large the use reactors would [not be economically or technically
efficient. [A **small**]{.mark} module **[reactor]{.mark}** can
**[provide]{.mark}** the [variable **generation** of **power**]{.mark}
for a wider [range]{.mark} of [consumers]{.mark} and
applications]{.underline}. This might include a replacement of old power
plants that use fossil fuel. Also, SMR might provide power and heat
generation for countries with small electricity grids as well as for
distant and off-grid areas. Using modules that can be combined to reach
the needed level of power supply, SMRs get the economics of scope due to
possibilities of serial production and economy of time for the
commission because of short-term construction time. These factors make
the use of reactors very prospective on the shelf and land of the
Russian Arctic \[4\]. A major milestone has already been reached in SMR
technology deployment in the Arctic. [The **[Akademik
Lomonosov]{.mark}** floating nuclear power plant (**[FNPP]{.mark}**) in
the Russian Federation with two-module KLT40S designed by JSC
"Afrikantov OKBM", has been **[connected]{.mark}** to the
**[grid]{.mark}** and [started **commercial operation**]{.mark} in May
2020 at the harbor of Pevek --- an Arctic port town in Chukotka
Autonomous Okrug, Russia. Akademik Lomonosov FNPP **[solves two
problems]{.mark}**. Firstly, this is the replacement of the retired
capacities of the Bilibino NPP, which has been operating since 1974, and
the Chaunskaya combined heat and power plant (**[CHPP]{.mark}**), which
is more than 70 years old. Secondly, this is the [provision]{.mark} of
[energy]{.mark} to the [main mining companies]{.mark} located in Russian
Chukotka, in the Chaun-Bilibino energy cluster --- a large ore-metal
center, including gold mining companies and business projects related to

[[**Despite** periods]{.mark} of intense **[bilateral rivalry]{.mark}**,
the United States often [managed]{.mark} to find **[common
ground]{.mark}** with the [Soviet Union]{.mark}, and later with
[Russia]{.mark} and [China]{.mark}, on [preventing nuclear
**proliferation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the height of the Cold War,
the United States and the USSR recognized that the instabilities and
dangers associated with the emergence of [[additional]{.mark}
nuclear-weapon [states]{.mark} could [jeopardize]{.mark} their [national
interests]{.mark}, not least because it could create [new power
centers]{.mark} and undercut their own [dominant]{.mark} positions in
[world affairs]{.mark} and, for Moscow, [raise]{.mark} the
[specter]{.mark} of a nuclear-[armed **Germany**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In the Soviet era, this shared interest led to close collaboration in
addressing proliferation threats, including in [[drafting]{.mark} the
nuclear [Nonproliferation]{.mark} [Treaty]{.mark} (NPT) and establishing
the [London Group]{.mark} of nuclear [exporters]{.mark}, which became
the Nuclear Suppliers [Group]{.mark} (NSG). Later, Washington
[worked]{.mark} with Moscow to **[encourage]{.mark}** Belarus,

to [persuade Iran]{.mark} to [accept]{.mark} strict **[limits]{.mark}**
on its [nuclear programs]{.mark} in the Joint Comprehensive
[Plan]{.mark} of Action (JCPOA)]{.underline}. China was a latecomer to
nonproliferation. [In the nation's early years, it publicly
**[advocated]{.mark}** the [spread]{.mark} of nuclear [weapons]{.mark}
to "[break the **hegemony**]{.mark} of the superpowers]{.underline}." By
the early 1990s, however, it had come to see considerable value in
curbing proliferation. [It believed that by adhering to
**[nonproliferation]{.mark}** norms, it could [promote]{.mark} a more

development; maintain the non-nuclear-weapon [status of
**Japan**]{.mark} and other **[Asian]{.mark}** neighbors; bolster its

of the six-party talks in the 2000s, China played an active role in
pressing North Korea to halt and eliminate its destabilizing strategic

[[Since]{.mark} the **[beginning]{.mark}** of this **[century]{.mark}**,
growing **[concern]{.mark}** over climate [change]{.mark} has pushed
**[nuclear energy]{.mark}** to the [forefront]{.mark} of energy policy
**[considerations]{.mark}** across the world. The enormous
**[growth]{.mark}** in China's energy demand over the [**last**
decade]{.mark} has made nuclear [energy **e**]{.mark}**xpansion** an
attractive option to address the country's growing
**[dependence]{.mark}** on energy imports]{.underline}. What's more, as
a zero-carbon form of power generation, nuclear offers the simultaneous
benefit of reducing reliance on coal and addressing rising concerns with
environmental pollution and climate change. [With the
**[remarkable]{.mark}** pace and scope of its [domestic
**nuclear**]{.mark} power program, [China]{.mark} has quickly become a
**[formidable]{.mark}** force in the global nuclear energy industry.
with the remarkable **pace** and scope of its domestic nuclear [power
program **expansion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the beginning of 2011,
roughly 40 percent of reactor construction around the world was taking
place in China, and it is poised to become the largest market in the
coming decades. [[Hope of a global **nuclear**]{.mark}
[renaissance]{.mark} within [some **quarters**]{.mark}, however, has
**[evaporated]{.mark}** since the [nuclear power disaster]{.mark} in
**[Fukushima]{.mark}**, Japan in March 2011]{.underline}.

The Fukushima accident had [[varying]{.mark} degrees of
**[impact]{.mark}** on nuclear power **[programs]{.mark}** around the
world, including that of [China]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the exception
of a few advanced [**[economies]{.mark}** with slower energy demand
growth, the **[overall]{.mark}** response from governments was
[not]{.mark} to [scrap]{.mark} or [severely]{.mark} limit [**nuclear**
energy]{.mark} in their respective [**national** energy
mix]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those countries, such as Germany, that wanted
to move to a post-nuclear energy strategy seized the crisis to push
forward. [Those that wanted to [expand]{.mark} nuclear
**[power]{.mark}** as a matter of domestic [energy]{.mark} strategy were
not going to abandon it [because]{.mark} of one **[accident]{.mark}**.
Ultimately, Fukushima's effect on global [nuclear power
**programs**]{.mark} was somewhat [neutral]{.mark}---it neither set them
back for decades nor [boosted]{.mark} the **[prospects]{.mark}** of a
[renaissance]{.mark}. In the case of China, its leadership decided to
[continue **nuclear** power expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[But **Fukushima**]{.mark} had an [**undeniable** effect]{.mark} on
[raising]{.mark} China's [concern]{.mark} over nuclear
**[safety]{.mark}**, just as it had also triggered a [wave]{.mark} of
safety [inspections]{.mark} and prompted **[reevaluation]{.mark}** of
nuclear [safety]{.mark} and accident [mitigation

[Specifically, [what **efforts**]{.mark} exist to **[address]{.mark}**
safety-related [concerns]{.mark} in the context of the phenomenal [pace
of **nuclear**]{.mark} development [in China]{.mark}]{.underline}?
Moreover, what opportunities exist for China and the United States to
collaborate on nuclear safety? [The [US **nuclear**]{.mark} industry
[has a wealth]{.mark} of [operational]{.mark} [experiences]{.mark} but

while China's growing nuclear reactor fleet is short of human capital

[In the list of '**[expanding]{.mark}** countries' in the world, [China

growth.

[[China's 19 **reactors**]{.mark} under construction [include several
**advanced** models]{.mark}. "The nuclear **[industry]{.mark}** is
**[watching]{.mark}** China put the first [AP1000 **reactors**]{.mark}
in Sanmen and Hiayang in operation," said Nesimi Kilic, nuclear engineer
at the IAEA]{.underline}. Out of these, Sanmen-1 is expected to be
finished by 2018. The EPR reactor in Taishan is also expected to enter
commercial operation in 2018. With the commissioning of Sanmen-1, more
of such reactors could be built in other countries, according to Kilic.
"China has become a pilot for the world," he remarked.

The economics of nuclear

[[**China's** energy regulator]{.mark}, the **[National]{.mark}** Energy
**[Administration]{.mark}**, is expected to set the country's nuclear
capacity **[target]{.mark}** to [120-150 gigawatts by
2030]{.mark}]{.underline}, up from about 38 in 2017. Thanks to this
scale, [**[nuclear]{.mark}** is [economically
**competitive**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Chinese experts have said.

"We have a well-established, complete system in place," Zheng said. "Not
only from the point of view of design, but also manufacturing, quality
assurance, safety and construction. This is why nuclear power in China
is economically feasible."

Localizing the technology --- design and manufacturing in China --- is
what is giving the Chinese an advantage and making this expansion
possible, Kilic said. China has the facilities, the technology and the
human capability.

**[[Expansion abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[China's ambitions]{.mark} are also **[global]{.mark}** as it plans to
[export **nuclear**]{.mark} power **[reactors]{.mark}** in the
future]{.underline}.

"[[With **technological**]{.mark} development, the [economy]{.mark} of

In reality, however, [[U.S. accession]{.mark} [would provide no
benefits]{.mark} not already available to the U.]{.underline}S[., [while
creating unnecessary burdens and risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Heritage
Foundation research linked below addresses these points clearly and
unequivocally:

[[U.S. membership]{.mark} in the convention [would not confer any
maritime right or freedom that the U.S. does not already
enjoy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. can best protect its rights by
maintaining a strong U.S. Navy, not by acceding to the convention.

For more than 30 years, through domestic law and bilateral agreements,
the U.S. has established a legal framework for deep-seabed mining.
[U[.S. accession would penalize U.S. companie]{.mark}s by
[subjecting]{.mark} [them to]{.mark} the whims of an unelected and
[unaccountable bureaucracy]{.mark} [and]{.mark} would force them to pay
[excessive fees]{.mark} to the International Seabed
Authority]{.underline} for redistribution to developing countries.

As a sovereign nation[[, the U.S. can]{.mark}---[and]{.mark}
[has]{.mark}---[secured]{.mark} title [to oil and gas resources]{.mark}
located on the U.S. extended continental shelf [without acceding to the
convention]{.mark}]{.underline} or seeking the approval of an
international commission based at the United Nations.

[[If the U.S. accedes]{.mark} to the convention, [it will be required to
transfer a large portion of royalties]{.mark} generated on the U.S.
extended continental shelf to the International Seabed Authority, and,
through the authority, [to corrupt]{.mark} and undemocratic
[nations.]{.mark}]{.underline} The U.S. should instead retain these
royalties and use them for the benefit of the American people.

[The U[.S. does not need to join the convention in order to access oil
and gas resources on]{.mark} its extended [continental shelf, in the
Arctic]{.mark}, or in the Gulf of Mexico.]{.underline} To the extent
necessary, the U.S. can and should negotiate bilateral treaties with
neighboring nations to demarcate the limits of its maritime and
continental shelf boundaries.

[[If the U.S. accedes]{.mark} to the convention, [it will be exposed to
climate change lawsuits]{.mark} and other environmental actions brought
against it by other members of the convention]{.underline}. The U.S.
should not open the door to such politically motivated lawsuits that, if
resulting in an adverse judgment against the U.S., would be domestically
enforceable and harm our environmental, economic, and military
interests.

The U.S. has successfully protected its interests in the Arctic since it
acquired Alaska in 1867 and has done so during the more than 30 years
that the convention has existed. [[The harm]{.mark} that would be
[caused by the convention]{.mark}'s controversial provisions [far
outweighs any intangible benefit]{.mark} that allegedly would result
from U.S. accession.]{.underline}

As Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, stated when he joined 33 other senators in
opposing ratification of the convention in 2012:

We simply are not persuaded that decisions by the International Seabed
Authority and international tribunals empowered by this treaty will be
more favorable to U.S. interests than bilateral negotiations, voluntary
arbitration, and other traditional means of resolving maritime issues.
No international the seas, and we are confident that our nation will
continue to protect its navigational freedom, valid territorial claims,
and other maritime rights. On balance, we believe that the treaty's
litigation exposure and impositions on U.S. sovereignty outweigh its
potential benefits.

[The [34 senators opposing ratification in 2012 were correct]{.mark} in
their assessment of the costs and benefits at the time.]{.underline}

[[Nothing has changed]{.mark} to lead the U.S. to reconsider accession
today]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[the inability to force Chinese
compliance]{.mark} despite a dispute tribunal ruling against Chinese
claims [in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea only [serves to

**[poses]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a possible **[[supply

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

During the 1990s, experts predicted a global peak in conventional oil
production around 2005, giving rise to the term \"peak oil\" in 2000. In
response, the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas was
established in 2001 to raise awareness of oil scarcity. The validation
of its claims, combined with the 2008 financial crisis, reignited
discussions of declining cheap oil production. Post-financial crisis,
interest in the peak oil debate gradually decreased due to an absence of
political proposals, a focus on climate change regulation, and a clash
with the mainstream belief in abundance and unlimited technological
progress. In the 2010s, the shale revolution that drove oil production
from unconventional resources, particularly US tight oil, had
significant economic and geopolitical implications globally. The unique
environment, including abundant shale resources, supportive hydrocarbon
policies, infrastructure networks, trained engineers, access to the
largest market, and unbridled speculative debt system, facilitated a
major boom in oil and gas output which further dampened the discussions
on peak oil. In the mid-2010s, the \"peak demand\" hypothesis emerged,
which suggests that peak oil will be driven by technological
advancements and policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Recently, the resource-limited peak theory has regained importance due
to the recent concerns about the ability of the tight-oil industry to
increase production and recover pre-crisis levels after the 2020
oil-consumption plunge and subsequent Saudi-Russia price war. As a
result, the issue of net energy from oil liquids in the context of a
transition to low-carbon energy sources requires more attention. The
Utility of EROI With our new energy landscape has come a new and
increasingly prominent metric. Energy Return on Investment (EROI) is a
ratio used to measure the amount of usable energy that can be extracted
from a particular energy source compared to the amount of energy
required to extract, process, and distribute that energy source. The
EROI values are presented as unitless ratios. For example, hydroelectric
power and nuclear power have one of the highest EROIs, with estimates
ranging from 30 to 100. EROI estimates for wind power range from 18 to
50. Solar and biomass energy have low EROIs, with estimates ranging from
2.5 to 10 depending on the specific technology and location. The EROI
for oil is estimated to be between 4 and 30, depending on the specific
location and type of oil. Natural gas has a higher EROI than oil, with
estimates ranging from 20 to 40. Higher EROI value indicates a more
energy-efficient method, while lower value suggests that more energy is
being invested in the energy-production process than is ultimately
gained from the produced energy. It is also worth noting that the EROI
of different energy sources can change over time due to technological
advancements, changes in resource availability, and shifts in market
conditions. For example, the EROI of shale gas has increased in recent
years due to advances in hydraulic fracturing technology, but this has
also led to environmental concerns and increased regulations that can
probably reduce the EROI of shale gas. The EROI of different energy
sources can have important implications for energy policy and
decision-making, as it impacts the overall cost and sustainability of
our energy systems. When it comes to oil liquids, we can assess the EROI
first by grouping them as: Onshore fossil oils, e.g., field oils,
natural gas liquids or NGLs, shale/tight oils, oil sands. Onshore
manufactured oils, e.g., mined shale oils, gas-to-liquids,
coal-to-liquids, biofuels or biomass-to-liquids, refinery gains.
Offshore oils from various depth intervals, e.g., by depth 0--500 m,
500--1000 m, 1000--2000 m and 2000+ m. The contribution of different
types of oil to gross energy is led by onshore field oil (60%), followed
by offshore shallow oil (20%). Shale tight oil and oil sands input are
limited to small fractions of 3% and 2%, respectively. Onshore field
oil, shale tight oil, and offshore oil from 500 m to 1000 m have the
highest EROI of 30. Followed by offshore oil from 1000 m to 200 m, and
mined shale oil at EROIs of 12 and 10, respectively. Plummeting EROI of

and production of these liquids is taken into account, [the
[**net**-energy **peak**]{.mark} is expected to occur [in]{.mark}
**20[25]{.mark}**]{.underline} at a level of 400 PJ/d (Delannoy et al.
2021). For context, the US consumed 100,000 petajoules of energy in
2021.

It is projected that the [[energy needed for]{.mark} oil liquid
[production will **increase exponentially**]{.mark} from **1.5**
PJ/d]{.underline} in 1950 [to **210** PJ/d in 2050]{.underline}, after
which it is expected to plateau.

Energy [**necessary** for the production of oil liquids is **growing**
at an **exponential rate**, representing **15.5%** of]{.underline} the
[energy production of oil liquids]{.underline} today and [[**projected**
to reach]{.mark} a proportion equivalent to [**half** of]{.mark} the
**[gross]{.mark} energy [output]{.mark}** by **2050**]{.underline}
(Delannoy et al. 2021).

The gross energy production from oil liquids is likely to peak in the
next 10 to 15 years, and the contribution of unconventional liquids will
increase to about half of conventional oil at its peak. The energy
required for oil liquids production is expected to increase
exponentially, and the weighted average EROI of oil liquids is expected
to reach a low plateau of 6.7.

The EROI of different sources of energy declines at different rates, but
the dominance of onshore field and offshore shallow oil in overall
energy production (80% of the total contribution) suggests that to
assess future projection uncertainties, these sources of oil liquids
should be focused on as they are the most important sources of oil
currently.

However, unconventional oils, such as shale tight oil, are expected to
grow in proportion, and the yearly contribution will undergo important
changes in the coming decade.

The [weighted average [**EROI** of]{.mark} **onshore field oil** and
**shallow offshore [oil]{.mark}** is **going down**, and the two will
**continue** to **[move downwards]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[EROI **Starvation** [Leads to]{.mark}]{.underline} \'**[[Energy
Cannibalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'

Forecasts have traditionally focused on gross energy rather than net
energy, which is the amount of energy available after accounting for the
cost of acquisition.

With the increasing use of unconventional oil liquids and the need for a
transition to low-carbon energy sources, it is important to consider the
impact of changes in resource quality on net energy availability at a
global scale. Today, energy scientists consider a net-energy decrease to
be a real, yet under-recognized, risk.

The [[**decline** of **EROI**]{.underline}]{.mark} over time for
nonrenewable energy sources [is [**due** to]{.mark} **physical
[depletion]{.mark}** and **tech**nological **improvement**
factors]{.underline}. The [EROI]{.underline} is theorized to start at a
high level, grow rapidly to a maximum, and gradually [**decline** to
[reach an **asymptotic limit** of **one**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The decline years vary for different resources. [[As]{.mark} the **EROI
[estimates decrease]{.mark}**, the **[peak year]{.mark}** for energy
production **[shifts]{.mark}** to an **[earlier]{.mark}** date and the
peak magnitude also decreases.]{.underline}

This highlights the importance of considering EROI when predicting
energy needs and assessing the future of the world\'s energy supply.

We [need to be **aware** of]{.underline} the [**sharply declining** EROI
of oil **over time**.]{.underline}

Notice the key qualifying

In 2020, two decades after the beginning of Energiewende, its
deliberately accelerated energy transition, Germany still had to keep
most of its fossilfired capacity (89 percent of it, actually) in order
to meet demand on cloudy and calm days. After all, in gloomy Germany,
[**photovoltaic [generation]{.mark}** [works]{.mark} on **average [only
11]{.mark}**--12 [**percent** of **time**]{.mark}, and the combustion of
fossil fuels still produced nearly half (48 percent) of all electricity
in 2020.]{.underline} Moreover, as its share of wind generation has
increased, its construction of new highvoltage lines to transmit this
electricity from the windy north to the southern regions of high demand
has fallen behind. And in the US, where much larger transmission
projects would be needed to move wind electricity from the Great Plains
and solar electricity from the Southwest to high-demand coastal areas,
hardly any long-standing plans to build these links have been realized.
\[75\]

As challenging as such **[[arrangements]{.underline}]{.mark}** are,
[they [rely on]{.mark} **technically mature**]{.underline} (and
**[[still improving]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**---that is, on [**more efficient
[PV]{.mark}** [cells]{.mark}, **large onshore** and **offshore wind
[turbines]{.mark}**, and **[high-voltage]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(including **[[long-distance]{.underline}]{.mark}** direct current)
**[[transmission]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If [**costs**, **permitting**
processes, and **not**-**in**-my-**backyard sentiments**
were]{.underline} no **[obstacles]{.underline}**, these techniques could
be deployed fairly rapidly and economically. Moreover, the problems
[of]{.underline} intermittency of solar and wind generation could be
resolved by renewed reliance on nuclear electricity generation. A
nuclear renaissance would be particularly helpful if we cannot develop
better ways of large-scale electricity storage soon.

[We need very **[large]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([multi-gigawatt-hour]{.underline}) **[[storage]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for big cities and megacities, [but so far the **only viable** option to
serve them is pumped hydro storage (PHS]{.underline}): it uses cheaper
nighttime electricity to pump water from a low-lying reservoir to
high-lying storage, and its discharge provides instantly available
generation. \[76\] With renewably generated electricity, the pumping
could be done whenever surplus solar or wind capacity is available, but
obviously [**[PHS]{.mark}** can [**work only** in places with **suitable
elevation**]{.mark} **differences** and the **[operation
consumes]{.mark}** about a [**quarter** of **generated
electricity**]{.mark} for the uphill pumping of water.]{.underline}
[**Other** energy storages, such as **[batteries]{.mark}**,
**[compressed air]{.mark}**, and [**supercapacitors**, still]{.mark}
have [**capacities orders** of **magnitude lower** than needed]{.mark}
by large cities, even for a single day's worth of storage]{.underline}.
\[77\]

In contrast, modern nuclear reactors, if properly built and carefully
run, offer safe, long-lasting, and highly reliable ways of electricity
generation; as already noted, they are able to operate more than 90
percent of the time, and their lifespan can exceed 40 years. Still, the
[future of nuclear generation remains uncertain]{.underline}. Only
China, India, and South Korea are committed to further expansion of
their capacities. In the West, the [combination of]{.underline}
[**[high]{.mark} capital [costs]{.mark}**, [major]{.mark} **construction
[delays]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**availability** of
**less expensive**]{.mark} **choices**]{.underline} (natural gas in the
US, wind and solar in Europe) [has [made]{.mark} new
**[fission]{.mark}** capacities **[unattractive]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Moreover, America's new [**s**mall]{.underline},
[**m**odular]{.underline}, and inherently safe
[**r**eactors]{.underline} (first proposed during the 1980s) [have
**yet** to be **commercialized**]{.underline}, and Germany, with its
decision to abandon all nuclear generation by 2022, is only the most
obvious example of Europe's widely shared, deep anti-nuclear sentiment
(for the assessment of real nuclear generation risks, see chapter 5).

But this may not last: even the European Union now recognizes that it
could not come close to its extraordinarily ambitious decarbonization
target without nuclear reactors. Its 2050 net-zero emissions scenarios
set aside the decades-long stagnation and neglect of the nuclear
industry, and envisage up to 20 percent of all energy consumption coming
from nuclear fission. \[78\] Notice that this refers to total primary
energy consumption, not just to electricity. Electricity is only 18
percent of total final global energy consumption, and the
[**[decarbonization]{.mark}** of more than **80 percent** of **final
energy uses**---by industries, households, commerce, and
transportation---[will be]{.mark} **even more [challenging]{.mark}**
than the decarbonization of **electricity gen**eration]{.underline}.
Expanded electricity generation can be used for space heating and by
many industrial processes now relying on fossil fuels, but [the course
of decarbonizing **modern long-distance** transportation remains
**unclear**.]{.underline}

5\. FLOATING NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

5.1 Issues with land-based nuclear power plants

Even though uranium is the cleanest and greenest and most sustainable
source of energy, [[people **dread** living close to a]{.mark} nuclear
power plant]{.underline} (**[[NPP]{.underline}]{.mark}**).

[**[Property value]{.mark}** in the vicinity takes a hit]{.underline}
when construction begins for a new NPP [and will [remain
**depressed**]{.mark} for the life of the plant]{.underline} because of
concerns about radiation and explosions.

[Contractors building **land-based** NPP]{.underline} often [have to
contend with **space limitations** that add **time** and
**cost**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} often [relates to the
containment building housing the reactor which has a thick wall with gas
proof **requirements** as well a dome roof]{.underline}. During
[construction]{.underline} the movement of building material, equipment
and workmen [is a **nuisance** that residents have to tolerate for five
to ten years]{.underline}.

NPP consumes large quantities of water. Nearly all the 92 nuclear
reactors in the US are sited close to rivers, with a few close to the
sea. Recent [extreme heat calls into question the reliability of
**[riverside NPP]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rivers that have run dry
recently include the Yangtse, Colorado, Rhine, Danube, Volga and Ganges.
With global warming many more [rivers will [experience **drying out**
and]{.mark} when they do **[reactors]{.mark}** will [need to **shut
down**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[NPP in **seismic regions** face the [risk of **tsunamis**]{.mark} if
sited [near the **coast line**]{.mark}]{.underline} to access seawater
for cooling (the case with Fukushima.) The war in Ukraine has highlight
another dimension to the risk of NPP on land. Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power
Station, one of largest in the world, is in a battlefield and at risk of
collateral damage as long as the war continues.

5.2. [Why **[floating]{.mark}** rather than **land-based**?]{.underline}

Wind farms are increasingly deployed offshore where wind energy is
denser and space is not an issue.

It is also desirable [to deploy [NPP]{.mark} **offshore**]{.underline}.
This [[would **reduce**]{.mark} the **[perception of
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It would]{.underline} also
[**[avoid]{.mark}** having to designate an "**exclusion
zone**]{.underline}." It [also enables the avoidance of [**movement**
of]{.mark} new and [spent **fissile material** through populated
areas]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Small Modular Reactors (**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[offer such
possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first floating NPP that was
built exclusively for generation of electricity is the Russian built
Akademik Lomonosov. The builder, [Rosatom]{.underline} State Nuclear
Energy Corporation, [is constructing three more]{.underline}.

It is to be noted that [small reactors have been used for propulsion of
commercial vessels going back **decades**]{.underline}. The NS Savannah,
a passenger-cargo ship; the ore carrier Otto Hahn, and the Sevmorput,
which carried cargo until 2012 were built by the United States, Germany
and Russia respectively. The advantage of going nuclear was obvious. The
[power plants are **energy dense**]{.underline}. [It takes **little
space**]{.underline} meaning more space is available for cargo.

[There are more than **100** **nuc**lear powered
**sub**marine**s**]{.underline}. [Many aircraft carriers are nuclear
powered for the same reason]{.underline}: [energy density]{.underline}.
Nuclear powered battle ships [vessels]{.underline} have the distinct
advantage of being [able to be out at sea for **months** without the
need for **re-fuelling**]{.underline}, [or **resurfacing**]{.underline}
in the case of submarines for recharging batteries. Their subsea
endurance is limited by the need to replenish food for the crew.
Likewise, for reasons of endurance icebreakers are nuclear powered. The
impacts that icebreakers have to endure testify to the robustness of
their reactors.

### \-\--AT: Geoengineering\-\--2AC

#### Geoengineering [fails]{.underline}, exacerbates [other]{.underline} environmental crises, causes [global war]{.underline} and [temperature snap-back]{.underline} from [lapses]{.underline}

Umberto M. **Sconfienza 20**, Goethe University Frankfurt, "Incomplete
Ecological Futures," World Futures, vol. 76, no. 1, Routledge,
01/02/2020, pp. 17--38

The strategy of growing the economy first and then wait for people who
have developed green preferences to build government capacity for
stricter environmental regulations is not effective: the process is too
slow, it happens at the expenses of other countries (Moran, Lenzen,
Kanemoto, & Geschke, 2013), and, presently, it cannot be squared with
the continuous pursuit of economic growth (Jackson, 2009; Ward et al.,
2016). For these reasons, [the kind of policy strategy **compatible**
with continuous economic **[growth]{.mark}** has to [rely on
**tech**]{.mark}nological solutions to expand humanity's ecological
boundaries]{.underline}. From today's vantage point, [geoengineering is
poised to quickly become the preferred technological
solution]{.underline} for market actors with a stake in pollution and
technocratic elites profiting from the status quo. [This alliance around
geoengineering has started to become visible during COP21 and is
reflected in]{.underline} the [Paris]{.underline} Agreement, [which
formally left the door open to]{.underline} the [deployment of
geoengineering]{.underline} technologies to achieve the goal of staying
below 2 C of global warming compared to pre-industrial level (Anderson,
2015).

Before problems. [One of the major **problems** of the geoengineering
strategy is the **difficulty of reaching an international
agreement**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [geoengineering]{.underline}
**[r]{.underline}**esearch **[and d]{.underline}**eployment [before
ecological circumstances make geoengineering **necessary**]{.underline}.
According to a standard categorization (Royal Society (Great Britain),
2009), [there are two types]{.underline} of geoengineering: Negative
Emissions Technologies (**[[NET]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [remove carbon
emissions from the atmosphere]{.underline}, Solar Radiation Management
(**[[SRM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [alter the reflectivity of the Earth to
cool the planet. [Both]{.mark} options, to be effective,
[require]{.mark} a **[planetary]{.mark}-scale
[implementation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and involve **huge
risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If this is the road humanity thinks it
should pursue, then an adequate **global agreement** which **settles**
issues of **ethics** and **governance**]{.underline} [must be reached.
[Without **a**]{.mark}n agreed **[blueprint]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
action at the international level, [early]{.underline}
**[unilateral]{.underline}** [action]{.underline} by states,
corporations, or, even, wealthy individuals, [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely [[lead to **conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[social tensions]{.underline}** to the point of compromising future
collective efforts and [[plunging]{.underline}
**[humanity]{.underline}**]{.mark} further [[into]{.underline}
**[chaos]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Speaking [specifically]{.underline} of
**[SRM]{.underline}**, Szerszynski, Kearnes, Macnaghten, Owen, and
Stilgoe (2013) find that it [is an "inherently **political**
technology"]{.underline} (Winner, 1980), [which is incompatible with
liberal democracy]{.underline}.

After problems. [The unlikelihood of a global agreement on
geoengineering is also underscored by the different perceptions of the
states -- informed, in turn, by different values, beliefs, and
rationally formed priorities -- of the **consequences which might
occur** once geoengineering has been implemented on a planetary
scale]{.underline}. In particular, [the large deployment of
**[BECCS]{.mark}**]{.underline}, quite popular because it appears in 184
out of the 204 scenarios assessed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC, 2014) which meet the 2 C target, [[is **not**]{.mark}
fully **[understood]{.mark}** in theory, [much less **tested**]{.mark}
in practice]{.underline} ([[only a **handful of small
facilities**]{.mark} around the world currently
[exist]{.mark}]{.underline}). According to Williamson (2016) and Burns
and Nicholson (2017), [BECCS is likely to **[negatively impact
food]{.mark}** security, fresh**[water]{.mark}** availability,
**[biod]{.mark}**iversity, and [disrupt]{.mark} the
**[nitrogen]{.mark}** cycle. **[Social]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[stress]{.mark}, **competition** for [scarce **resources**, and
**migrations**]{.mark} could then all plausibly
[ensue]{.mark}]{.underline}. As per SRM, [the consequences of misuse of
this technology are even **more dire** than NET's as, without an
ambitious planetary commitment to mitigate and capture carbon,
[SRM]{.mark} would **[lock humanity into]{.mark}**]{.underline} this
sort of **[[geoengineering for centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}** to come
[and [would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[expose]{.mark} us to
**[rapid]{.mark}**]{.underline} and **[[calamitous]{.mark} temperature
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[if]{.mark} it were to be [suddenly
**stopped**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Burns & Nicholson, 2017; Niemeier &
Tilmes, 2017). [[Temperatures would **skyrocket**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[well]{.underline} **[above]{.underline}** the [2 C]{.underline} goal
somewhat arbitrarily established by the scientific and policy community
(Titley, 2017). [And temperature increases of **4 C**]{.underline} --
argues Anderson -- [are]{.underline} "[**[incompatible]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} **[any]{.underline}** reasonable
characterization of an organized, equitable, and civilized **[[global
community]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Anderson, 2012, p. 29).

None of these reasons are causes for comfort. [[Modeling]{.mark},
regardless of improvements, [may]{.mark} simply [be **incapable of
capturing rare tipping-points**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and is **not
intended to accurately predict**]{.mark} **or foresee
[non-rational]{.mark} political [dynamics]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Elsawah et al., 2020). In addition, [a [gradual rational phase-in
and]{.mark} phase-[out relies on optimal governance
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Overly rapid deployment]{.mark} due
to "free-driving"]{.underline}5, (Weitzman, 2015) [[or overly slow
phase-out]{.mark} due to technological or infrastructural
lock-in]{.underline} (Seto et al., 2016) [[are entirely
plausible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, SAI impacts may also not
follow the pathway of historical analogs. The core rationale of SAI is
to manufacture the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption in a "safe"
manner, not replicate volcanic processes. Deviance from historical
analogs is especially a possibility if the choice or mix of aerosol is
radically different. This is particularly the case since [climate change
and [human-pressures]{.mark} are [already pushing ecological systems
into novel states]{.mark}]{.underline} (Williams and Jackson, 2007;
Williams et al., 2021). **[[SAI would push systems into further novel
states that make unseen ecological responses
likely]{.underline}]{.mark}** (McKinnon, 2018).

[[Our understanding]{.mark} of both Earth systems and the likely
contours of deployment [are too weak]{.mark} for us [to rule-out]{.mark}
a potentially]{.underline} **[[catastrophic]{.mark} form of [ecological
blow-back]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For now, **[the literature points to
SAI having numerous impacts.]{.underline}** But none seem remotely
capable of being a GCR, particularly if SAI deployment were limited.
Nonetheless, [the Specter of an unforeseen tipping point in the Earth\'s

### \-\--AT: Sunshades\-\--2AC

#### Sunshades are [impossible]{.underline} to operate, [spark]{.underline} international disagreement, and [drive]{.underline} warming.

Jon **Kelvey 23**. Reporter citing István Szapudi, the creator of the
sunshade and Alan Robock, Climatologist at the Rutgers Geoengineering
Project. \"Would a massive shade between Earth and the sun help slow
climate change?.\" Popular Science. 8/9/2023.
https://www.popsci.com/science/sun-shade-asteroid-lagrange/

Some of the most exotic solutions to climate change are the various
forms of geoengineering. Such proposals aim to reduce global warming by
shrinking the amount of solar radiation that reaches Earth's
surface---by, say, injecting large amounts of sulfur dioxide or dust
into the air to mimic the cooling effect of large volcanic eruptions. Or
building catapults to launch lunar dust into orbit around Earth and
intercept the sun's rays in the space near our planet.

But University of Hawaii [cosmologist **István [Szapudi]{.mark}** has an
even more **far-out idea**: place a]{.underline} 372,000-mile-wide [sun
shade]{.underline} tethered to a captured asteroid [between **Earth**
and the **sun** to reduce the amount of **solar radiation** reaching our
**planet**]{.underline} by 1.7 percent. His analysis is agnostic to the
shade's shape, though he imagines it could be a circular shade made of
triangular segments, able to open or close like flower petals to allow
variable amounts of sunlight through.

"It's not going to cast a sharp shadow," Szapudi says. "Maybe with a
telescope you could notice that there is something in front of the sun.
But other than that, it would just be that people would notice that the
weather is a little bit better."

[He **readily [admits]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[this
**concept**]{.underline}]{.mark} would require millions of dollars
investment in just preliminary engineering studies to see if it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} really possible. "Of course, it's
**[[unrealistic]{.underline}]{.mark}** to actually do this, so
[[**hopefully**, we will]{.mark} slowly [give up **fossil
fuels**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Szapudi says, citing a much more
mainstream goal to curb a source of climate change. "But that's a very
long-term process."

In the meantime, he suggests, maybe the world can consider alternatives
to help mitigate the change in climate that occurs from the carbon
already in Earth's atmosphere today.

Szapudi's proposal, as described in a paper published on July 31 in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, would place this
massive sun shade at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1, or L1. This is a
region of space about 932,000 miles toward the sun from Earth where the
gravity of both bodies cancels out, allowing a spacecraft orbiting L1 to
maintain a constant position relative to the sun and Earth with minimal
maneuvering. The James Webb Space Telescope makes use of the same
phenomena at L2, the L1 point's counterpart 932,000 miles away from
Earth in the direction of the outer solar system.

Szapudi is not the first to suggest placing a sun shade at L1, but
previous proposals ran into problems. Namely, [[a]{.mark} **large [sun
shade]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} also act like a **solar sail**,
[catch]{.mark}ing [**solar radiation** that will push the **structure**
out of **position**]{.mark}]{.underline} at L1. [**Previous
[proposals]{.mark}** [got around]{.mark} this [by making the]{.mark}
**sun [shade]{.mark}**]{.underline} extremely
[[massive]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the order of 350 million tons,
perhaps of metal or asteroid stuff---[[an]{.mark} **utterly
[unrealistic]{.mark}** []{.mark}amount of **[mass]{.mark}** even for a
**proposal** [that's]{.mark} already this **[far
out]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Szapudi instead proposes connecting it to an asteroid counterweight by
tethers up to 1.9 million miles long. Since the sun's gravity is more
potent the further away from L1 and closer to the star you go, the tug
of solar gravity on the asteroid will counterbalance the radiation
pressure on the sun shade, allowing it to stay in place.

With such a configuration, Szapudi estimated the shade itself might
weigh only 35,000 tons. "That's something that SpaceX could put up in
space" using its current rockets, he says, though it'd take a lot of
time and effort. A sun shade could be made even lighter, Szapudi
suggests, if made from something like graphene, an extremely light and
strong material consisting of atom-thick sheets of carbon atoms arranged
in a hexagonal lattice pattern.

Astronomers would have to identify a suitable near-Earth asteroid for
the counterweight through something like the University of Hawaii's
Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS),
Szapudi says. But once they did, the sun shade could be tethered to the
asteroid in its existing orbit and used as a solar sail to divert the
space rock toward the L1 point.

[[**Engineering-wise**, the]{.mark} whole [idea is]{.mark} **extremely
[speculative]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Szapudi emphasizes, [[relying on
**tech**]{.mark}nology that is [not]{.mark} yet **[developed]{.mark}**,
such as materials **strong** and **light** enough to **serve** as the
**tethers**.]{.underline}

But [it's]{.underline} also [not **clear** if]{.underline}
geoengineering of [this sort would actually help **mitigate** the
**effects** of climate change]{.underline}, or do so [without
introducing]{.underline} other, **[unpredictable]{.underline}** and
negative **[consequences]{.underline}**, [according to Rutgers
University climatologist **Alan Robock**. Robock leads the Rutgers
Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project]{.underline}, which uses
climate change models to predict the effects of geoengineering
interventions.

"What if you start doing it and you say, 'OK, we figured out that 90
percent of the world is going to be better off, but 10 percent is going
to be worse off," Robock says. "But we don't know which 10 percent
because of randomness in the climate system."

And [some effects are]{.underline} well understood, likely, and [not
good]{.underline}, he adds.

"For example, [[you'd get **drought**]{.mark} in **Africa** and
**Asia**, because the **summer monsoon** is driven by the **temperature
difference** between the land and the ocean in the summer]{.underline},"
Robock says. "[[If you **block**]{.mark} out [the
**sun**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the **land** would cool]{.mark} more
than the **ocean**]{.underline}. And so that [**[temperature]{.mark}
difference** [would go down]{.mark}. In the **summer monsoon
[precipitation]{.mark}** [would be reduced]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Lucy **Sherriff 23**. Environment Journalist. \"Algae biofuels still a
no-go, new research confirms.\" Canary Media. 6/26/2023.
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/algae-biofuels-still-a-no-go-new-research-confirms

Biofuels made from algae have had their time in the sun, with
[[**years** of]{.mark} **highly publicized [investments]{.mark}**
[from]{.mark} fossil fuel **[companies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as
Exxon and Chevron, and studies [showing **potential**]{.underline} for
the energy source to replace fossil fuels. [[**New research**
suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, that [[biodiesel]{.mark} derived
from microalgae [may]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [[emit more
**carbon** during **production**]{.underline}]{.mark} and use
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} petroleum-based
**[[diesel]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The biofuel's **poor performance** is due to its **manufacturing
process**, which requires more **energy** than the **final product** can
produce]{.underline}.

As a group, **[biofuels]{.underline}** --- fuels made from renewable
natural resources, such as plants, coffee grounds and vegetable oils ---
[emit less **carbon dioxide**]{.underline} into the environment [than
**fossil fuels**]{.underline}. And microalgae, phytoplankton that grow
in fresh and salt water, have qualities that made them seem like
high-potential candidates. Some phytoplankton produce up to 30 times
more energy than other biofuels because they contain large quantities of
fats that can be converted into fuel. And phytoplankton grow rapidly,
flourishing in a wide variety of climates and habitats --- including in
wastewater --- and don't require the diversion of food into fuel
production, unlike corn, soybeans and other biofuel crops. Yet [these
advantages]{.underline} alone [don't translate to **energy
efficiency**.]{.underline}

**[[Previous research]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [looked at improving
the **energy efficiency** of extracting **fat** from
**microalgae**]{.underline} or genetically engineering types of
phytoplankton that produce greater quantities of fats. But [these
**efforts**]{.underline} have [[relied]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly [[on
**lab-based studies** conducted with **small**]{.mark} **amounts** of
**[algae]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[a **far cry** from what it takes
to produce]{.mark} **biofuels** [in the]{.mark} **real
[world]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In this new study, Tom Bradley, director of Decerna, a United
Kingdom­--based consulting company that specializes in low-carbon
economies, and his co-authors partnered with a facility to produce
biofuel from phytoplankton at an industrial scale. They grew the
microalgae under artificial light on a diet of glycerol, yeast and other
chemicals, and then extracted the fats and converted the usable ones
into biodiesel.

Throughout the process, the study authors collected data on the energy
demands of each step, then tallied the carbon emissions from burning the
final product. The result is a more realistic evaluation of the
real-world environmental impacts, says Bradley.

The [[**authors** found]{.mark} that]{.underline} the [**environmental
[costs]{.mark}** [of building]{.mark} the [**infrastructure**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} grow and [[process]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[algae]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and of producing the electricity to
run the operation, [[more than **counterbalance**]{.mark} the
**environmental [savings]{.mark}**]{.underline} of burning the biofuel.

When Bradley began this research more than a decade ago, he was
extremely hopeful about the promise of microalgae. But he no longer sees
it as a strong choice. ​"[**[Microalgae]{.mark}-derived biodiesel**
[cannot outperform]{.mark} **conventional [diesel]{.mark}**]{.underline}
without a significant breakthrough," he says.

Energy giant **[[Exxon]{.underline}]{.mark}**Mobil appears to share
Bradley's concerns. The company began **[quietly
[withdrawing]{.mark}]{.underline}** from its multimillion-dollar,
[14-year algae **research [efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline} in December
2022.

In Policy Scenario 1, [all the models show carbon leakage

of carbon leakage is from the]{.underline}

estimate implies that, for every 100 tons of GHG emissions that the

emissions by 11.8 tons.

is]{.underline} **[insufficient]{.underline}** [to offset
the]{.underline} **[carbon-leakage effect]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} coalition\'s [unilateral abatement

since global emission targets require emission reductions by
non-coalition countries, not simply the absence of carbon leakage,
additional measures are needed to achieve global emission targets.

### \-\--AT: CCS\-\--2AC

#### CCS is an [abysmal failure]{.underline}\-\--capture [impossible]{.underline} or [miniscule]{.underline} and causes [leaks]{.underline}\-\--results in [moral hazard]{.underline} that spikes emissions. 

**Robertson '22** \[Bruce; September 1; Energy Finance Analyst --
Gas/LNG at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis;
"Carbon capture has a long history. Of failure"; Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists;
https://thebulletin.org/2022/09/plagued-by-failures-carbon-capture-is-no-climate-solution/#post-heading\]

As the climate change movement gained momentum, the oil and gas industry
wisely rebranded enhanced oil recovery as a "climate-friendly" process
with a new name: carbon capture utilization and storage. Today, [over 70
percent of [carbon capture]{.mark} projects are]{.underline}, in fact,
[**enhanced oil recovery** projects [used to **produce more oil
and**]{.mark}**/or [gas]{.mark}**[, resulting in]{.mark} yet
**[more]{.mark} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis has estimated
that [most of the total captured carbon throughout history found its use
in enhanced oil recovery]{.underline}---approximately 80--90 percent.
Only a small proportion of carbon capture projects (approximately 10--20
percent) have stored carbon in dedicated geological structures without
using it for oil and gas production.

Despite its long history, [carbon capture is a problematic
technology.]{.underline} [A new IEEFA study reviewed the capacity and
performance of 13 flagship projects and found that **10 of the 13**
**failed**]{.underline} or underperformed [against their designed
capacities, mostly **by large margins.**]{.underline}

The [natural gas processing sector dominates the application of carbon
capture technology.]{.underline} The [gas production process requires
the removal of carbon dioxide.]{.underline} [While many gas companies
now claim to produce "carbon-neutral" gas]{.underline} or liquefied
natural gas, [this is little more than marketing]{.underline} hubris.

[The "[carbon-neutral" tag]{.mark} has been [obtained by]{.mark} using
carbon capture to capture the [10--15 percent]{.mark} of]{.underline}
Scope 1 and Scope 2 [emissions]{.underline} (the emissions generated
from producing natural gas) during the gas production process
[[or]{.mark} by purchasing carbon [offsets]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet [up
to **[90 percent of emissions]{.mark}** from oil and gas **[do
not]{.mark}** **[occur at production]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead,
[these emissions]{.underline}, called Scope 3 emissions, [**[occur
when]{.mark}** the product is actually used]{.underline}, [that is,
**[burnt.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As shown in our study, [capturing Scope
3 emissions, the **biggest chunk of emissions** created]{.underline}
from using the product, [is **not being accounted** for in these
"carbon-neutral" claims.]{.underline}

Apart from the poor performance of carbon capture projects, [carbon
capture]{.underline} in power plants [has shown a [**track record** of
**technical failures**]{.mark}]{.underline} since 2000. [Close to
**[90]{.mark} [percent]{.mark}** of the proposed global carbon capture
capacity in the power sector has **[failed]{.mark} at the
implementation** stage or was **suspended early**.]{.underline}

[Even if the carbon dioxide can be injected underground, there is no
guarantee that [it will]{.mark} stay there and not **[leak]{.mark} into
the atmosphere.**]{.underline}

[There are several real-world examples of failure to keep gas
underground.]{.underline} The best example is the California Aliso
Canyon gas leak in 2015, the worst man-made greenhouse gas disaster in
US history, when 97,000 metric tons of methane leaked into the
atmosphere. While the leak at Aliso Canyon was a methane, not carbon
dioxide, leak, depleted oil and gas reservoirs are commonly used to
store captured carbon dioxide. The problems encountered at Aliso Canyon
could also be encountered with carbon dioxide at a carbon capture
project.

Another failure was the In Salah project in Algeria, a carbon capture
project with a total cost of US\$2.7 billion. Injection started in 2004
and was suspended in 2011 due to concerns about the integrity of the
seal and suspicious movements of the trapped carbon dioxide under the
ground.

[The entire efficacy of the carbon capture process has been called into
question by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]{.underline}.
In its special report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, the IPCC
stated:

"[CO2 [storage]{.mark} is **[not]{.mark}** necessarily
[permanent.]{.mark} Physical leakage from storage reservoirs is possible
via (1) gradual and long-term release or (2) sudden release of CO2
caused by disruption of the reservoir."]{.underline}

[Carbon capture has been [**used as a justification** for **new oil and
gas**]{.mark} **projects**. It has a **history of poor performance**,
only **[captures a fraction]{.mark}** of the **total emissions** from
the lifecycle of oil and gas production and its **long-term efficacy is
questionable**]{.underline}.

**CCS increases warming.**

Carbon capture and storage [[(CCS)]{.mark} has]{.underline} often [been
hailed as a]{.underline} potential [game-changer in]{.underline} the
fight against [climate change]{.underline}, but [its [**history**
is]{.mark}]{.underline} full of [over-promising and]{.underline}
**[[under-delivering]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and this is unlikely to
change in the foreseeable future. Yet it is still included in government
policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, even though the
reality is it is more likely to increase them.

CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from oil and gas
reservoirs or large industrial sources and storing them underground to
prevent their release. Many oil and gas companies cite CCS as a key part
of their strategy to reduce emissions and achieve net zero, over varying
time periods. However, [[for **oil** and **gas**]{.underline}]{.mark}
extractors [[it]{.mark} only [means burying a]{.mark} **[small
proportion]{.mark}** [of their total emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} from
each gas or oil field.

For gas companies, CCS means removing the CO2 contained in the gas
field; this is known as Scope One emissions and often represents well
under 10% of the total emissions associated with each gas project. It
rarely involves the burying of Scope Two emissions, which is the CO2
created when gas is processed at the downstream gas plant, cleaning it
up by removing impurities such as CO2 and nitrogen, before it is sold on
the domestic market, or chilled to create liquefied natural gas (LNG)
for shipping to global export markets.

[[The **majority** of]{.underline}]{.mark} [GHG
**[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[from gas]{.underline}]{.mark}
projects [[are created when]{.mark} the gas is [**combusted** or
**burnt**]{.mark}]{.underline} by consumers for heating or cooking, as a
feedstock for industry, or generating electricity. [**[None]{.mark}** of
these emissions]{.underline}, categorised as Scope Three, [[are
**captured** by CCS]{.underline}]{.mark} facilities, and [[they
represent]{.underline}]{.mark} [[around **90%**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
the **emissions**]{.underline} from a gas project.

Essentially, [[CCS is being used]{.underline}]{.mark} as a way [[to
**boost oil** and **gas** production]{.underline}]{.mark}, legitimised
by the claim that it is all [in the pursuit of **lower
emissions**]{.underline}. The net zero targets for fossil fuel companies
are largely confined to Scope One and Two emissions, with Scope Three
excluded even though it accounts for the majority of the emissions from
every oil and gas project.

The concept for CCS originated from a desire to extract more oil from
very depleted oil fields. Producers saw that CO2 could be pumped into
the oil field to extract the last remnants of oil there. This process is
known as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and it has been around for more
than 50 years after it was first deployed in the US during the 1970s.

The majority of projects that are termed CCS or CCUS (carbon capture,
utilisation and storage), are EOR ventures. This means the focus is more
on extracting more oil or gas rather than storing CO2 underground, which
means pumping more emissions into the atmosphere.

To put into perspective the challenge involved, global energy-related
CO2 emissions rose by 410 million tonnes (mt) to reach a new high of
37.4 billion tonnes in 2023. Meanwhile, after 50 years of trying, the
capacity of CCS dedicated to the geological storage of CO2 was only
11.33 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), and the amount of CO2 injected
was below capacity levels.

The Gorgon CCS venture is part of the 15.6mtpa Gorgon LNG project
operated by Chevron and located on Barrow Island offshore Western
Australia. According to the Global Status of CCS report, published each
year by industry group the Global CCS Institute (GCCSI), the Gorgon CCS
project only injected 1.72mt of CO2 into storage in the 2022-23 fiscal
year to 30 June, or 43% of the targeted annual CO2 injection volume of
4mtpa.

Based on the Gorgon experience, it can be concluded that less than
10mtpa of CO2 was injected in 2023 -- or 0.00026% of global
energy-related emissions last year.

Despite the abysmal record of CCS, [[the major **fossil fuel companies**
are]{.mark} still [advocating for it]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chevron says
on its website: "CCS is a proven technology for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG). It's critical to a lower carbon future and essential to
achieving the net zero goals of the Paris Agreement."

Given that [[it has taken around]{.mark} **[50 years]{.mark}** [to
capture]{.mark} **[less than 10mtpa]{.mark}** [of
CO2]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} it is going to take a heroic
technical effort to meaningfully reduce the 37 billion tonnes of CO2
being pumped into the atmosphere each year, and a gargantuan sum of
money to build the CCS facilities. Chevron and its Gorgon CCS partners
have invested more than AU\$3.2 billion in the Gorgon CCS project to
bury a total of around 9.5mt of CO2, which equates to a cost of
AU\$336.8 to bury a tonne of CO2. Apply that to the 37 billion tonnes of
CO2 of energy-related emissions each year, and the cost is in the
trillions.

The promotion of CCS by the fossil fuel sector aims to maintain business
as usual, not to reduce production of oil and gas, meaning
[**[emissions]{.mark}** [of this scale will]{.mark}
**[continue]{.mark}**]{.underline} into the future. [[A **cheaper**
option]{.underline}]{.mark} to reduce emissions [[is to move to
**cleaner**]{.underline}]{.mark} forms of [[energy]{.mark}
production]{.underline}.

NRC\'s Role in Implementing International Safeguards

[[The **U.S.**]{.mark} Nuclear Regulatory Commission]{.underline}
(**[[NRC]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[is involved in]{.mark} those aspects
of International Atomic Energy Agency]{.underline}
(**[[IAEA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[safeguards]{.mark} that affect
NRC-licensed commercial and public nuclear installations]{.underline}.
As such, it brings an important perspective to both U.S. and
international deliberations on IAEA safeguards for these facilities.
[[NRC is the **only Federal agency** that]{.underline}]{.mark} (a) [[has
**oversight** of]{.mark} the same types of [**commercial facilities** on
which the **IAEA** conducts]{.mark} **safeguards [inspections]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} (b) [[has]{.mark} the [**experience** in
**facilitating**]{.mark} IAEA **[safeguards]{.mark}** for such
facilities]{.underline}. Additionally, [the NRC supports U.S. Government
**negotiations** with the IAEA and interactions between the IAEA and
NRC-licensed facilities]{.underline}. The NRC also leads and
participates in interagency groups of the U.S. government on safeguards
technical and policy areas.

More than 250 NRC-licensed facilities are made eligible for IAEA
selection for implementing safeguards on a routine basis. Historically,
the IAEA has implemented and subsequently withdrawn traditional
safeguards at several facilities under the US-IAEA Safeguards Agreement.
Thirteen NRC licensed facilities were selected and inspected at various
times between 1980 and 2005, including 6 commercial power reactors, 5
low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel fabrication facilities, and two
high-enriched uranium (HEU) down-blending projects. Four NRC-licensed
facilities are currently selected by the IAEA under the U.S. Reporting
Protocol for nuclear material flow and inventory reporting. These 4
facilities are required to submit a completed IAEA design information
questionnaire to the NRC and to update the information as required. In
addition, the NRC receives, reviews, and submits declarations with
respect to the U.S. Additional Protocol. Since the Additional Protocol
entered into force in 2009, NRC has submitted several hundred entries to
the U.S. declarations for NRC-licensed entities.

[The NRC conducts outreach activities with the relevant licensees to
ensure that they understand their international safeguards
responsibilities]{.underline}. [The NRC has the **responsibility** to
effectively represent in **national** and **international forums** its
**licensees concerns**]{.underline} with regards to, among others,
protection of commercially sensitive and proprietary information,
impacts on plant operations, and facility safeguards and security
(including information security). [An important perspective that NRC
brings to international safeguards is its experience in how IAEA
safeguards can be **practically applied** to **effectively** and

In what has become an exceedingly rare phenomenon, [[lawmakers]{.mark}
on Capitol Hill]{.underline} this week [[reached **across the aisle**
and **coalesced** around]{.mark} a piece of energy
legislation]{.underline} to send it to President Joe Biden's desk.

The [support was **resounding**]{.underline}. [The [sweeping
**nuc**]{.mark}lear **[energy bill]{.mark}**]{.underline} known as the
"ADVANCE Act" [[sailed through the **Senate**]{.underline}]{.mark} as
part of S. 870, the "Fire Grants and Safety Act," [[on an **88**-**2**
**vote**]{.underline}]{.mark} Tuesday, just over a month after the
package [garnered more than **390 votes** in the **House**]{.underline}.

It was [an [especially noteworthy]{.mark} achievement [for a]{.mark}
divided [Congress **roiled** by **partisanship** on]{.mark} nearly
**[every subject]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [including **energy
policy**]{.underline} --- [[and in]{.mark} the **throes** of [an
**election year**]{.mark}]{.underline} adding increased scrutiny to
lawmakers' every vote.

Passage didn't come easily. And whether the effort can be replicated
with other major energy packages winding their way through Congress is
far from certain.

Lawmakers involved in the effort and observers off Capitol Hill say
that's because [[nuclear]{.mark} energy]{.underline} and the
multibillion-dollar industry behind it [represent [a **unique** form of
**power**]{.mark} **generation** [that]{.mark} [has something to offer
for]{.mark} nearly **[all lawmakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[**regardless** of their views]{.mark} on **energy** policy or
**climate change**]{.underline}.

Indeed, supporters of the "Accelerating Deployment of Versatile,
Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act" have hailed it as an
"all-of-the-above" bill that represents a lifeline for the beleaguered
nuclear energy industry, [a boost for carbon-free energy, a boon for
energy security and a one-way ticket to global nuclear energy
dominance]{.underline} --- all in one neat package.

"I'm not sure what our colleagues would call that in their states, but
in Delaware, something like that, [we call it [a **win**-**win**-**win**
**situation**]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.),
chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and one of
the bill's architects.

Nuclear energy is among the few energy sources that can produce
zero-emission, reliable baseload power at a large scale. Reactors
account for nearly 20 percent of all American energy production and are
by far the biggest domestic source of carbon-free electricity.

While geothermal and hydropower similarly provide clean, consistent
power, they comprise a small fraction --- about 6 percent combined ---
of the country's electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration.

the University of Notre Dame\'s Reilly Center for Science, Technology,
and Values; Notre Dame Journal on Emerging Technologies, "The Moral
Imperative of Green Nuclear Energy Production," vol. 1\]

VII\. The Moral Perspective

[[We must]{.mark} **totally [decarbonize]{.mark}** our energy
economy]{.underline} within at most a few decades [[if we are to
**avert**]{.mark} a **[climate]{.mark} catastrophe** [that will **kill
billions**]{.mark} of people [and render]{.mark}]{.underline} large
parts [of our [planet **uninhabitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have
seen that this cannot be done with solar and wind power alone. [Nuclear
power is the **only** technologically **feasible
solution**]{.underline}. It is comparatively safe and shovel ready.
Putting irrational fears aside, what could be the objection to a crash
program to replace fossil fuels in electricity generation by nuclear
power?

[[**Critics** of **nuc**]{.mark}lear [**power** have **raised**]{.mark}
a number of **[ethical objections]{.mark}** to nuclear
power]{.underline}. But before we review them, [let us **recall** that
[the decision]{.mark} to be made [is not about **nuc**]{.mark}lear
[**power alone**. Instead]{.mark}, the [decision is]{.mark} a
**[comparative]{.mark}** one. The **ethical** issues
**concern**]{.underline} a program of rapidly expanding nuclear power in
comparison with other courses of action of which there are really only
[two]{.underline}:

(1) [[Do **nothing**]{.mark}, which [**dooms** the
    planet]{.mark}]{.underline}.

(2) [[Continue]{.underline}]{.mark} on the path called for in the Paris
    Agreement [[by **expanding renewables**]{.mark} as rapidly as
    possible, **[reducing]{.mark} energy** [consumption, and developing
    **new** approaches]{.mark} to **CO2 capture** and **sequestration**,
    all the [while hoping for some **miraculous**]{.mark} technological
    [**breakthrough**. This approach will]{.mark}]{.underline} mitigate
    the impacts of climate change, but will still
    [[leave]{.underline}]{.mark} our children and grandchildren with [a
    [planet]{.mark} **dramatically [different]{.mark}** [from]{.mark}
    the [world we know, a planet **far less hospitable**]{.mark}, where
    those who survive will lead **seriously diminished
    lives**.]{.underline}

There are no other alternatives.

The more serious ethical objections to expanded nuclear power fall into
two categories, social and environmental justice and obligations to
future generations. Many of those who criticize nuclear power on grounds
of social and environmental justice base their arguments on serious but
commonplace errors about the health and environmental risks and the
comparative safety of nuclear power, errors that have already been
addressed in this paper, as well as misunderstandings of the science and
engineering of nuclear power. As an example, consider the Unitarian
Universalist Association\'s 1976 Social Justice Statement on nuclear
power, which starts from three premises:

1.  The high probability that many people would be exposed to low-level
    radiation, an eventuality which is known to cause birth defects and
    to result in deaths from cancer, usually after time delays of years.

2.  The highly probable exposure of future generations to the lethal
    effects of the long-lived radioactive waste products inevitably
    produced by nuclear power plants.

3.  Uncertainty in regard to the likelihood of catastrophic release of
    radioactive materials into the environment, because estimates of
    \"nuclear safety\" published by the nuclear power industry and its
    government sponsors neglect the dangers resulting from defects in
    construction and the lack of an adequate program for training
    nuclear power plant inspectors and operators.8 6

Where do those probability estimates come from? Whence the uncertainty
in those estimates of the likelihood of catastrophic releases of
radioactive materials? No documentation is given and none could be
given, because there are no such high probabilities, and the suggestion
that risk analyses ignore possible construction defects and deficient
training is hard to credit.

Or consider a recent paper on \"Emerging Environmental Justice Issues in
Nuclear Power and Radioactive Contamination\" from the International
journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, where the authors,
one a sociologist from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, the
other a sociologist from Arizona State, write:

> Commercial nuclear power has also proved repeatedly to lack the
> \"absolute safety\" guaranteed by industry proponents (see \[3\]). As
> a series of catastrophic reactor accidents has shown, the commercial
> uses of nuclear fission materials to generate electricity are not
> without potentially severe multiscale risks\.... This potential has
> been variously displayed at Chernobyl in Russia (1986), Three Mile
> Island (TMI) in U.S. (1979), and most recently at Fukushima in Japan
> (2011). Indeed, on the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster
> (2016), no technology yet exists to handle the melted highly
> radioactive 2000-ton core of the failed reactor, a core that will be
> lethal to humans for thousands of years \[5\].87

When one follows the s, the first leads to an article in the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists that discusses the myth of \"absolute safety\"
only in the context of the Fukushima accident, the point being about the
practice inJapan of overselling the safety of nuclear power to allay
concerns deriving from Japan\'s experience with nuclear weapons in World
War II, a practice that, the authors argue, contributed to a lack of
preparedness.88 The paper did not generalize beyond the unique situation
in Japan, because there is no global myth of \"absolute safety. j89 The
second leads to an article at McClatchyon the thirtieth anniversary of
the Chernobyl accident that includes claims such as that the \"death
toll estimates run from hundreds to millions,\" when the actual death
toll as determined by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the
Effects of Atomic Radiation is, as was mentioned earlier, 58.90 And what
is this supposed series of catastrophic reactor accidents? Chernobyl is
the only accident that qualifies as a \"catastrophe,\" and there only 58
people died. At Three Mile Island, there was no significant radiation
release, and no one died or even got sick as a result of the Fukushima
accident, aside from those who died because of the hasty and
questionable evacuation.

Still, there are legitimate and serious questions of social and
environmental justice concerning nuclear power. A good place to turn for
more sober and well-grounded scholarship on the topic is the 2015
collection, The Ethics of Nuclear Energy.9\' Foremost among the
significant social and environmental justice concerns about nuclear
power are issues such as siting decisions, exemplified by government and
industry\'s callous disregard of the interests of local communities in
deciding to locate the Yucca Mountain storage facility on land sacred to
the Shoshone and Paiute peoples or by regulatory agencies neither
seeking nor respecting public input, an all-too-common occurrence.92 It
goes without saying that the interests and opinions of all who are
potentially affected by a decision on the location of a nuclear power
plant or nuclear waste depository must be respected.

But [[there is **nothing unique** to]{.mark} the [nuclear power]{.mark}
industry]{.underline} in this regard. Exactly [the [**same kind** of
**insensitivity**]{.mark} and **indifference** [is encountered in
**every industry**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as evidenced by disasters like
the 2008 coal ash spill at the Tennessee Valley Authority\'s Kingston
Steam Plant that unleashed more than a billion gallons of highly toxic
fly ash slurry, destroying homes, farms, and the lives of some 30
clean-up workers.13 Any form of large-scale power generation will raise
the same questions. If anything, the problem could be much worse with
solar and wind, for, as we saw above, [the [**land use** needs
for]{.mark} **dramatically expanded** [solar and wind]{.mark} power [are
**immense**]{.mark}. While they do not produce [waste on]{.mark} the
[scale of a **coal-fired** power plant]{.mark}, there [are **toxic
materials**]{.mark} in those solar **panels**, [and significant]{.mark}
**toxic [waste]{.mark}** [is generated in]{.mark} their
**[manufacture]{.mark}**. Currently, [we do **not reprocess** and
**recycle** that waste, instead]{.mark} mostly just
**[shipping]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[it to]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~less
developed~~ \[**[[other]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [[**parts** of]{.mark}
the **[world]{.mark}** and hoping, against the **evidence**, that it
will be **dealt** with **safely**]{.underline}. 1 A big problem with
wind farms, aside from the huge amount of land they require, is their
aesthetic impact on the environment. Owners of the land where towers are
sited are compensated usually with annual payments, either a fixed rent
or a fixed rate based on the power produced. Neighbors are not
compensated. There are also growing expressions of concern about impacts
on wildlife.95

While nuclear and other forms of power production are on par regarding
social and environmental justice issues such as siting and waste
disposal, one might argue that nuclear poses unique challenges of
intergenerational justice, for the obvious reason that nuclear waste can
remain a hazard for 100,000 years or more. When we start burying nuclear
waste at the Onkalo facility in Finland, we will be imposing risks and
obligations on generations to come. Can we even imagine the task of
securing and monitoring these sites for, say, 5,000 years? It seems at
first glance as if it were the height of arrogance and the callous
disregard of the interests of unborn generations to do this.

But consider again that we cannot pose the question of intergenerational
justice about nuclear power alone. These are also comparative questions.
Viewed through that lens, nuclear power might appear more respectful of
the rights and interests of future generations. [Nuclear
[waste]{.mark}]{.underline}, for all of the risks it poses, [[**decays**
over time]{.mark}. The toxic [stew]{.mark} in the oceans [of **fly ash
slurry**]{.mark} adjacent to **[coal]{.mark}-fired** power
plants]{.underline} all around the world [will [remain **toxic
forever**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a crucial difference between
many forms of chemical toxicity and radiological toxicity. [The
[**same** is **true** of]{.mark} the [**chemical toxins** associated
with]{.mark} the production and disposal of [solar
**panels**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One recent study claims to show that
photovoltaic [solar [panels produce **three hundred** times **more**
waste]{.mark}]{.underline} (measured by volume), [per unit energy
generated, than does nuclear]{.underline}.96 While some chemical toxins
are eventually broken down naturally, by sunlight, water, bacteria, and
other processes, many of the worst, including heavy metals, are not.
[Lead today is lead **1,000,000 years** from now. They remain **toxic
forever**]{.underline}. And, yet, we virtually never hear of this toxic
burden being represented as a problem of intergenerational justice. Why
not?

Against the Nuclear Android, "*Nuclear Theory Degree Zero, With Two
Cheers for Derrida," pp. 7-11\] \[language modifications denoted by
brackets, un-underlined portions of this card mention self-harm\]

As a dysfunctional military-industrial complex, the nuclear android has
been resisted and fought. It can be defeated, though it may never be
cleaned up. Within the emergence of the nuclear android, moreover, there
are newish moments of science, pollution, military psychology and so on.
[[It becomes]{.mark} a **false** or [**empty totalisation** to]{.mark}
construe an]{.underline} "**[age]{.underline}**" [out of the
nuclear]{.underline}, [and the question whether it is unprecedented
**[conflate]{.mark}s** the question of [what is]{.mark} nevertheless
[**qualitatively** and **quantifiably different**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Hiroshima marks something different, as do the Nevada tests, as do
Chernobyl and Fukushima. [Asking whether there is anything **new** under
the nuclear sun that defines the nuclear age **obscures** such
differences]{.underline}, [as does insisting that some aspect of the
nuclear is the **radical break**]{.underline}. [Novelty is not the
substantive issue]{.underline}, [but the [changed conditions]{.mark} of
nuclear ecology [are]{.mark} **different**]{.underline}, [[**already**
disastrous]{.mark} and [with]{.mark} the ageing [potential to
become]{.mark} **[permanent]{.mark}ly** disastrous]{.underline}.

Derrida's talk of "the age" puts pressure on that which is unthought in
the temporality and technology of the ontological predicament
characterised as "nuclear." The nuclear android imposes fundamental
[[ontological questions]{.underline}]{.mark}, but rather than contesting
our nuclear differences the horizon of "the" nuclear age allows some
"unprecedented" moment or substance -- plutonium, perhaps, or Trinitite
-- to be hypostatised, and then questioned as a concept. The alternative
model of brutal acceleration follows from a false binary. The Manhattan
Project evidently accelerated the creation of weapons of mass
destruction, and with it, the military-industrial complex. It's the
rhetorical binary, however, that [[**deflects**]{.mark} thinking [away
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the kind of
**[[concrete]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Brechtian [[questions
of]{.underline}]{.mark} knowledge, science and politics figured in
Brecht's play Galileo Galilei. Newish but not fundamentally
unprecedented risks, toxicities and threats are bound up with [the
**military-industrial complex** of the nuclear android]{.underline}, and
[not just as **theoretical fictions**]{.underline}, [but more
as]{.underline} a cyber-behemoth, [an **anthropogenic technological
catastrophe**]{.underline}. Brutal acceleration is also a slow-moving
disaster, and the unfolding differential reality is idealised if
understood either as "the" ontological question of our time or as
repetition or intensification. The development of nuclear physics,
military technology, uranium extraction and enrichment scarcely happen
in a flash: they were socially and politically organised across uneven
and conflictual processes. We can see here an important shape of nuclear
argument, one that is also framed by the Cold War. [The
shock]{.underline} of the nuclear android [prompts temptations to
**deflect** argument]{.underline} away from a politics of anti-nuclear
solidarity [onto the terrain of]{.underline} Western
**[metaphysics]{.underline}** from Heidegger to Aristotle. The diversion
of questions of science, power and political agency into the politics of
the question can then be shown to be rooted in some unthought framing of
the question of technology, of the political as such.

Derrida also dramatises the incompetence of nuclear criticism, not quite
to bring the practice of the theoretical humanities into question but to
open up our status as "non-experts," critics "who know at least that
they are not military professionals, are not professionals of strategy,
diplomacy, or nuclear techno-science" (Derrida 22). There are some
important democratic deficits in the relevance of expertise sustaining
the nuclear android. But Socratic modesty -- knowing that you know
nothing -- has its own, sophistic competence, "We are specialists in
discourse and in texts, all sorts of texts" (ibid.). The "we" of
Derrida's rhetoric is a problem, as is the slippage between discourse
and text:

inasmuch as we are representatives of humanity and of the incompetent
humanities which have to think through as rigorously as possible the
problem of competence, given that the stakes of the nuclear question are
those of humanity, of the humanities. (Ibid.)

This is special pleading, a ruse to reinscribe the professional
competence of scholars in the humanities to comment on questions that go
beyond their scientific competence, to mediate on behalf of humanity.
Who is this "we" that imagines being representative of humanity so
quickly conflated with the humanities? But amid "all sorts of texts,"
one sort of text not much opened by such specialists are textbooks of
nuclear physics. The nuclear fable somehow saves the relevance of
literature for nuclear annihilation, and thereby preserves the Olympian
competence of the incompetent humanities to comment on the nuclear.
Derrida even suggests that: "the phenomenon is fabulously textual also
to the extent that, for the moment, a nuclear war has not taken place:
one can only talk and write about it" (23).

A further line of political deflection is the accelerationist strategy.
There are quasi-leftist accelerationists (Mackay and Avanessian). [We
should **take seriously** the proposition that the **only way to save
the planet** is to **accelerate the pace of**]{.underline} technological
**[innovation]{.underline}**. On one view, the only way to save the
planet from global warming is by developing nuclear fusion technology.
This points down the pathway of the Hadron collider and big science. But
there is another acceleration that would decommission all forms of
nuclear technology, and rather than imitating the sun, seek renewable
forms of symbiosis with solar energy. A global diversion of military and
industrial resources into renewable and sustainable energy forms would
constitute a technological acceleration coupled with a radical
deceleration in fossil fuel consumption, perhaps even putting the brakes
on the fallacy of economic growth. What quickly emerges is that [there
are **choices to be made** across contested terrains.]{.underline} The
forms of acceleration are political choices, choices of great urgency,
but [to **thematise**]{.underline} "acceleration" as such [provides
**scant critical purchase** on different forms]{.underline} of
acceleration. [What is needed are **nuanced mediations** of the science
and technology **currently available**, along with **global democratic
decision making** on those [tech]{.mark}nologie[s]{.mark} [we]{.mark}
choose to [**accelerate** or **slow down**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Another version of the "accelerationist" argument captures some of the
ideological workings of the term. In Marxist circles, an
"accelerationist" is someone who thinks that the collapse of capitalism
will be hastened by allowing reactionary forces [to **speed up**
capitalism's self-destruction]{.underline}. There are occasions when
such an argument has validity: nothing about the form of the argument
makes it inherently or structurally wrong. There are revolutionary
moments when allowing capitalism to collapse in order to rebuild a
socialist society is a better path than propping up a failing capitalist
regime. The judgement is political rather than philosophical. In most
contexts, however, the accelerationist argument, especially as a
political principle, [is **deeply dangerous**]{.underline}. [[It would
be **better**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [for example]{.underline}, [[to
**preserve a failing**]{.mark} **US capitalist
[regime]{.mark}**]{.underline} while building social forces to take it
over, [[than]{.mark} to [allow]{.mark} the **[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}** of the United States [to **fall into**]{.mark} **the
hands of [a]{.mark}**]{.underline} ~~suicidal~~
\[**[self-destructive]{.underline}**\] [**[military]{.mark} rearguard**
or some **counter-revolutionary terrorist organisation**]{.underline}.
[[Preserving]{.mark} the [possibility of]{.mark} human [life might
involve]{.mark} **[propping up collapsing]{.mark} capitalist
[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [not least [the **nuclear safety
inspectorate**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[rather than **allowing humanity
to be swallowed up** by some **death spiral** ]{.mark}**of presidential
dictators** in fear of being toppled]{.underline}. [These are **critical
judgements** that could arise at **any moment**]{.underline}, [with
**real risks** that poor judgements will **hasten a nuclear
confrontation** that leads to **mutually assured
annihilation**]{.underline}. [The **formal shape** of an]{.underline}
accelerationist [argument needs to be understood **strategically** and
**politically** if it is to address nuclear questions]{.underline}.

The accelerationist view that the deepening of capitalism could hasten
its self-destructive tendencies and lead to its collapse is not
inherently suicidal, but [consideration of what the collapse of
capitalism might mean for the [**global stock** of]{.mark} nuclear
**weapons** and nuclear [**power stations** indicates
**dangers**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Amid the collapse of
capitalism, [[securing]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[safety]{.mark}** of
nuclear resources [is a]{.mark} **fundamental
[priority]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} preparing a
decelerationist strategy is [[an **essential**]{.mark} political
[position for **any radical formation**]{.mark} serious about nuclear
safety]{.underline}. [Against the horizon of nuclear
crisis]{.underline}, [[we rely on **workers** to]{.mark} know how to
[**manage** and **decommission**]{.mark} nuclear weapons]{.underline},
[silos and power stations]{.underline}. This requires "good" science and
ongoing struggles to control the decision making around weapons and
energy systems. [**Concrete consideration** of what happens to ageing
nuclear systems in an imploding political system has been **tested** in
the fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline}. [Imagine the **retrenchment
of reactionary forces** around nuclear installations
threatening]{.underline} suicidal \[**[apocalyptic]{.underline}**\]
[**political terrorism** on a **global scale**]{.underline}. [The risks
of a collapsing capitalist system **taking the world down with it** are
clear]{.underline}. Chernobyl and Fukushima, moreover, stand as metonyms
of the risks involved in systems that were apparently functional and yet
spiralled out of control even in what might be called peacetime. The
risks of the US or the Chinese nuclear androids imploding involve
different decisions. Again, the need is for nuanced political judgements
and strategies, involving scientific expertise along with solidarity
between scientists, workers and new social formations.

The need for nuanced political engagement with "good" science suggests
some of the risks in any thematisation of science within archaic
philosophical paradigms. One form of nuclear denial is [the
[**reluctance to engage** with]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[concrete
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}** of scientific knowledge,
[[preferring]{.mark} to retreat behind **the limited competence of the

[hubris]{.mark}**]{.underline} of philosophical interpretation [[to

**[[understand]{.underline}]{.mark}** the fictional heart of
[[the]{.mark} nuclear [threat **despite knowing**]{.mark} **very

**[doubtless]{.underline}**, [be **philosophical**, **ontological** and
**metaphysical questions** that science and technology cannot
answer]{.underline}. Nuclear arguments may carry within their forms and
conditions of possibility the illusions of Western metaphysics, and
decommissioning nuclear metaphors could turn out to be as significant as
criticising the public lies of nuclear policy: but the nuclear android
also imposes less philosophical imperatives to engage with science, from
medical science to nuclear waste disposal, and through the critique of
the political economy of the nuclear android. [None of this suggests
that metaphysics **should** or **could be deleted**]{.underline}. [[To
**deflect engagement**]{.mark} with the existing mess]{.underline} of
the nuclear android [back into **metaphysical** and **literary

remains an imminent threat, but so does the persistence of practices and
strategies that contribute to maintenance of the spectacle of the
nuclear rather than its disarmament and decommissioning. To reduce the
problem to the "threat" of nuclear war is to imagine that the actually
existing industrial behemoth of nuclear production is a fiction. It
isn't. Nuclear weapons testing and the history of nuclear accidents were
not just fables, and nor was the arms race a war of sophistry and
rhetoric, however much sophistry and rhetoric were deployed to disguise
the ecocidal tendencies of the nuclear android.

**Nuclear energy and safety is [compatible]{.underline} with

**Walters '13** \[David; November 26; power plant operator, member of
Socialist Organizer; The Breakthrough, \"The Socialist Case for Nuclear
Energy,\"
https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/the-socialist-case-for-nuclear-energy\]

[Energy, the environment, global climate change, and sea level rise are
all]{.underline} huge, vast **[interconnected]{.underline}** subjects
[that generate]{.underline} much [debate]{.underline} and controversy at
every level of society. One expects this [when the **future of our
species**, and all other species, are at **stake**]{.underline}.

[The center of this discussion can be narrowed down to]{.underline} one
technological and scientific issue: the generation, use, and
[distribution of **energy**. The **historic application**]{.underline},
or utilization, [of various forms of energy is a measure of **human
progress**]{.underline}. Even before the rise of civilizations such as
the Indus, Greek, Persian, and others long gone were relegated to the
anthropology text books and museums, and even before the development of
class society, human use of energy set us apart from all other species,
including the higher ones such as dolphins and apes.

Heat to cook food or keep warm in colder climates was the first human
use of energy generated by the chemical reaction (though unknown to
early humans) of hydrocarbons when brought to a higher temperature. This
was low-density energy from a strictly biological source: wood.

Every step up the climb from pre-class society through the first
civilizations, through the massive slave societies of the Egyptian and
Roman empires through feudalism, and into and including our modern
imperialist; with every advance in the mode of production; with every
step forward in the application of scientific techniques for growing
food, understanding the seasons, and increasing productivity of
commodity creation; each has been intertwined dialectically with the
discovery and deployment of ever more abundant, ever more useful, ever
more dense forms of energy that could be deployed easily by growing
numbers of people seeking to make their lives easier.

[The rise and uplifting of [human]{.mark} culture has **always
[depend]{.mark}ed [on]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and been a function of,
this development and utilization of [[cheaper]{.underline}]{.mark},
[more abundant, and denser **[energy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**[Most]{.mark} on the [Socialist]{.mark} left have [forgot]{.mark}ten
[this]{.mark}**. The development of energy use by humans shows an
evolution from wood]{.underline} to water/hydro and wind to coal and
later to petroleum and gas, and finally [to nuclear]{.underline} power.
[Each has provided vaster quantities, and qualities, of energy for human
use. Each one has been denser than the last]{.underline}, that is, more
energy could be extracted from each subsequent form per measured unit of
weight or volume.

[This aided the expansion of the forces of production]{.underline} and
the utilization of more laborsaving devices and techniques, and led to
higher-quality goods and superior means of distribution.

It this development of the productive forces [that Marx saw as being
increasingly in conflict with the mode of production we know as
capitalism]{.underline}. Thus, [he saw the increase in production per
capita as a goal, a human species goal, and something to strive for.
Capitalism was beginning to hold this back]{.underline}, and thus one of
the main underpinnings of Marxism was established: showing the
contradictory nature of capitalism and how historically it sows its own
doom.

But what does this have to do with the central question raised earlier?
[In the left today, and the much broader Green and environmental
movements, this **[expansion]{.mark} of production [is
considered]{.mark} a "[bad]{.mark} thing."**]{.underline} It causes
pollution, ecological collapse, and climate change. No doubt, [the rapid
expansion of industry under capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries
has caused these terrible changes. But it also has allowed humans to
develop solutions through techniques that could alleviate these problems
were such forms of production placed under the **democratic control of
society**]{.underline}, that is, what we call
**[Socialism]{.underline}**.

[[Marx **understood**]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [[under
**communism**, production would **have to increase**]{.mark} to
alleviate the grinding poverty that prevailed in 90 percent of the
world's population of his day]{.underline}. In his 1847 essay The
Principles of Communism, [he]{.underline} posed the following question
and [provided an **answer**[:]{.mark}]{.underline}

[What will be the consequences of]{.underline} the ultimate
[disappearance of private property]{.underline}?

[This holds as true today as it ever did]{.underline} in the imagination
of Karl Marx before the 1848 upheavals across the European continent.

For today's 7 billion (and growing) people,
**[[Socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [can only be built by
harnessing the productive forces of the entire planet,]{.underline}
promises what Marx wrote of in 1847. [But we can do it]{.underline}
wisely, and [democratically]{.underline}, only [if we eliminate the
global imperialist system]{.underline}.

[Such a world of abundance [will require **more**]{.mark}**, not less
[energy]{.mark}**. **Yet**, there is a belief, especially
in]{.underline} the advanced Western countries of Europe and [North
America among Socialists and activists for social change, that humans
"use too much."]{.underline} This is an idea that has been absorbed from
the forces around the Greens and others who think there are too many
people, that [we cannot possibly sustain so many people on Earth, and
that if we brought the]{.underline} [**standard of living** of the
entire world up to that enjoyed by workers in these Western countries,
**the planet would be ruined**.]{.underline}

[Doing so under capitalism, the world would be **ruined**. Capitalism
has no way to lift the masses from poverty]{.underline}. Consider the
following:

> [There are 1.6 billion people with no electricity]{.underline}.
>
> [Billions of people have no access to energy efficient mass
> transportation]{.underline}.
>
> [Billions of people have little]{.underline} or no [access to
> education]{.underline} and health care.
>
> [Increasingly vicious wars and privatization]{.underline} [continue to
> cause grinding poverty, dislocation and environmental
> destruction]{.underline}.

[Capitalism is the **cause**. To bring the entire world to
the]{.underline} (rapidly dropping) [levels of Western
workers]{.underline} or "middle income" families [would require not
simply a fundamental increase in wealth redistribution and energy, but a
**vast per-capita increase in both**]{.underline}. But the refrain from
many environmentalists and even Socialists continued: "[We use too
much]{.underline}!" This [is as **reactionary** as wanting to bust
unions or launch wars of aggression of neo-colonial
conquest.]{.underline}

[These same [leftists put]{.mark} their [hopes in the **false
panacea**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} what has been
called [a "[100 percent]{.mark} fossil fuel-free/[nuclear-free]{.mark}
carbon-free renewable [energy economy]{.mark}]{.underline}." Many
[academic papers]{.underline} have been written seeking to prove the
practicality of such a project. [An equal number of [papers **destroy
this myth**]{.mark}]{.underline}; that is not the purpose of this essay.
Rather, consider several points about energy.

[The advance of civilization has been predicated on the accessibility of
and increased per-capita use of energy, but every paper advocating
renewable energy is based on a **massive reduction** in per-capita
energy use]{.underline}. While arguing renewable energy can power a
high-tech civilization on a planetary scale, authors believe that such
an endeavor itself could be carbon-free. Consider one example:
[according to]{.underline} almost [all studies, land-based wind energy,
the only kind being built in the United States, uses]{.underline} 8 to
[12 times the amount of concrete per unit of energy compared to nuclear
power.]{.underline} Concrete uses massive amounts of dirty natural gas
in its production. It uses more steel, copper, and aluminum, not to
mention that far more intensive extraction-mining of rare earth metals
is required for wind generators than for nuclear power.

[Because wind and solar energy have actual usable energy
production]{.underline}, or capacity factors (CFs), [that are very low,
massive **overbuilding of these systems will be needed**. Nuclear energy
in the United States is around **90 percent**]{.underline} CF; that is,
90 percent of the time, a 1,000 MW plant produces 1,000 MWs. In some
countries, it is even higher. [Wind's CF on land-based wind farms
is]{.underline} only **[33 percent]{.underline}**. Solar is only 20
percent because the sun is only at its useable height in the sky from
about 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

What to do? There is a lot of talk about storage, big batteries, or
using hot molten salts to store power. This can be done, but can it be
done on a genuine utility-scale basis? [The costs are **overwhelming**,
as **every** solar and wind plant utilizing storage has proven. And they
have remained]{.underline} in the **[experimental]{.underline}** stage
for more than a decade.

[Nuclear is **safe**]{.underline}. This sounds like an outrageous claim
in light of Fukushima and Chernobyl. In fact, the number of deaths per
amount of energy for nuclear is way lower than it is for fossil fuel. It
is lower than wind and solar if installation and industrial accidents
are taken into account. People will argue about the numbers, but given
what our species face with respect to global climate change, this is the
wrong argument. Those numbers are going to be outrageous; they already
are.

Fukushima could have been prevented. The capitalist board of directors
of Fukushima's operator TEPCO had its seawall only to minimum
"recommendations" when common practice in other countries, for private
or public utilities, is to build beyond specs. They also built their
fuel tanks for the auxiliary diesel generators powering their auxiliary
cooling system right on the water at their intake structure, rather than
locating them behind the plant up on the hill from where the video was
taken of the tsunami hitting the plant. There would have been no
"Fukushima accident" had TEPCO put safety ahead of profits.

However, there were no deaths from the accident itself (compared to the
20,000 who died from the earth quake and tsunami itself!) and many
experts believe there will likely be no fatalities because the
population was exposed to so very little radiation after the accident.

Chernobyl, a truly horrific accident that caused 4,000 treatable thyroid
cancer incidents (a number most likely vastly underreported), was a
one-off incident. A converted military-style reactor built by the
U.S.S.R using a design banned in all but two countries of the world,
exploded. The explosion sent dozens of tons of fuel into the atmosphere.
There are still 10 such reactors online and yet, despite Chernobyl and
despite the collapse of the U.S.S.R., there have been exactly zero other
accidents of the type that happened there at any of those plants. Why?
The nuclear industry in Russia stepped up and engineered out the ability
of humans to cause such an accident, and began to add large, heavy
containment to existing plants and design it into future plants. The
Russians also stopped building this type of Chernobyl-style reactor.

[Even under **capitalism**]{.underline}, the nuclear industry, [despite
**corruption**, despite the **profit motive**, has proved **superior**
to the fossil fuel industry]{.underline} (including both privately run
and publicly owned plants) in the number of deaths incurred through
normal operations. Any comparison of fossil fuel plants and nuclear
favors nuclear technology shows this to be the case.

Socialists argue that, like any technology, [[nuclear]{.mark} energy
[would be **far better**]{.mark} **employed in a [democratic]{.mark}ally
run**, worker- and consumer-controlled **public power grid**. Of this
there can be **no doubt**]{.underline}. But we are talking about
technologies that are being employed under capitalism generally. [Many
**developing countries** are delving into nuclear energy and developing
nuclear plants]{.underline} or at least the safety regimes required by
international law as a prerequisite to building a nuclear grid.

Countries currently building nuclear grids [include China, Vietnam,
India, Pakistan, the UAE, South Africa/Azania, and many more. They do
this without influence from the "nuclear industry" or other lobby groups
but after reviewing all the alternatives]{.underline}. Some of these
same countries are also building new coal and gas plants and, at the
same time, investing massive amounts to develop wind and solar power.

France is the world's premier user of nuclear energy. The French ruling
class decided that France had to eliminate its reliance on burning oil
for power generation. [In **15 years**, France went from zero to 79% of
its grid powered by]{.underline} 54 [nuclear]{.underline} power plants.
When an electric car gets plugged into the wall at night for recharging,
or an aluminum plant is running to produce the millions of tons of
aluminum needed in a modern society, everyone in France knows it is
nuclear, not fossil fuel, providing the power. France has demonstrated
that [even a **capitalist economy** can **rid itself of fossil fuels**
if it **deploys nuclear**.]{.underline}

There is nothing objectionable about [[wind and
solar]{.underline}]{.mark} power per se. They can be useful and should
be deployed in a limited fashion depending on local conditions (their
[[ability to displace coal]{.mark} and gas [is **overstated**]{.mark};
they are **married to both**, as the experiences of Germany and Denmark,
where wind and solar power are deployed widely, have
shown]{.underline}). [But it is **[nuclear]{.mark} power** that
Socialists should be fighting for: it [is]{.mark} **power [on]{.mark}
demand**]{.underline} [**[24]{.mark} hours** a day, **[7]{.mark} days**
a week, **365 days** a year; **and [every]{.mark} mega[watt]{.mark}**
produced by a nuclear plant **[can displace]{.mark}**, permanently, an
equal number of MWs produced from **[fossil fuels]{.mark}**. No
renewable source of energy, save for hydro-electricity]{.underline}
([which has limited potential]{.underline}) [can **make the same
claim**. This fact alone should disqualify renewables for serious
consideration as the solution to climate change.]{.underline}

[While massive amounts of renewable energy has been deployed in Europe,
not a **single** fossil-fuel plant has been phased out]{.underline} as a
result. [[Nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [**immediately
[displaces]{.mark}** [a fossil-fuel]{.mark} generation
[plant]{.mark}]{.underline}. China, which today has 30 nuclear plants
under construction, would be building 30 coal-fired plants if the nation
could not or was not allowed to go nuclear. [Socialists should not only
be **defending** the right of developing countries to build nuclear
power plants, we should be demanding the bosses' governments do so, and
expand its deployment]{.underline}. We should be fighting for workers
governments to come to power to organize society along the lines
outlined here.

[Socialists should oppose **waste** and **inefficiency**. These problems
are **worse in underdeveloped countries**]{.underline} than in the
advanced countries, [but because per-capita energy use is much higher in
the latter any amount of **wasted energy** generally **compounds**
already existing problems from garbage to **over-extraction of
resources**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [**pollution**, as well as
climate change. We should be for **conservation** and efficiency as a
function of any rational society based on human needs and not
profit]{.underline}.

But [this doesn't mean lowering anyone's]{.underline} **[standard of
living]{.underline}** (except the bankers and bosses, of course!). [It
really means a full-on reorganization of our productive and consumption
capacity with the goal of raising the development level of the
underdeveloped world in a rational and democratic manner]{.underline},
no longer under the jackboot of imperialism.

[What does this mean]{.underline}, really, [in many underdeveloped
countries where only 10 percent of the population has access to
electricity? Does it mean a 50-inch flat-screen LCD television? A
24-cubic-foot sub-zero refrigerator? Central air conditioning and two
SUVs in the front of a 3,000-square-foot home? Of course
not]{.underline}. And yet, [this seems to be what so many think when
they object to raising the standard of living of the billions in
underdeveloped countries to those of the West]{.underline}.

No, it means this: [[it means]{.mark} the **[right to]{.mark}** generate
and use **[electricity]{.mark}**. The right to the **ubiquitous light
switch**]{.underline} we take for granted in the West. It means electric
light available day and night, whenever an individual decides he or she
wants to read, whenever a student wants to study. It means at least a
small refrigerator where leftovers can be chilled without spoiling. [It
means a **laptop computer**]{.underline} [and access to the
**Internet**. It means, perhaps, a *small* television. It means some air
conditioning]{.underline}, perhaps only in one room, [so children don't
suffer diseases]{.underline} brought on by increasing temperatures in
our world. [It means an electric hotplate or stovetop so the 30,000
women and children who die every year in India from cooking with
charcoal indoors can live]{.underline}. That is what energy means, and
that is why we need more of it, a lot more, and why it has to be carbon
free. This is what it will take to make all of Africa, India, and most
of South Asia "developed."

[The [antinuclear]{.mark} movement **[condemns billions]{.mark}** of
people [to]{.mark} decades' more **[energy
starvation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[because of **misplaced**]{.mark}
**liberal [guilt]{.mark}** over
**[g]{.mark}**]{.underline}reen**[[h]{.underline}]{.mark}**ouse
**[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**as emission[**[s]{.mark}**. Rather than
coming up with truly better ways to produce energy, this movement wants
us to down-gear and "use less." This is why **antinuclear idealism**
should be characterized as a **reactionary response** to the climate
crisis, and it explains why Socialists who adapt to the Green ideology
**have lost their bearings**]{.underline}.

Small Modular [[Reactors]{.underline}]{.mark} ([SMRs]{.underline}) of
30MW to 300MWs [can be built in mass production lines, lowering their
cost. They can be set up in rural parts of any country and have an
electricity grid literally built around them that could]{.underline},
eventually, [be connected to and [form a **national grid**]{.mark} that
would enhance development and raise people's standard of living. There
are only [**two things** holding this **up:**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Technology [no longer]{.underline} requires mining and [fossil fuel]{.underline} is [infinitely worse]{.underline}.

Concerns with the cost and minerals needed for EV batteries deserve a
serious response, which I hope to provide here. Rare minerals such as
lithium and cobalt are used in many EV batteries, along with copper and
nickel. [Cobalt is mined in areas with poor human rights, and this is a
valid concern. But [**cobalt** is]{.mark} already [being **phased
out**]{.mark} in the latest battery designs; Tesla and others are now
using cobalt-free batteries.]{.underline}

[Lithium was once thought to be a limiting factor, but recent
discoveries of lithium around the world, including the U.S., have
changed
that.]{.underline} [[New]{.mark} extraction [techniques]{.mark} have [made **lithium available
from**]{.mark}** salty seas**]{.underline} [and
even]{.underline} **[[seawater]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Lithium is now fairly abundant and no longer a limiting factor.
And t[he [newest battery]{.mark} developments, such as solid state
batteries, **[use no]{.mark}ne of these [rare
minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So [battery technology and cost are
making **[rapid advances]{.mark}** that are
already [lessening]{.mark} rare mineral [concerns]{.mark} and will soon
put these concerns to rest. The [same **cannot** be said
about]{.mark} the mining and burning of **[fossil
fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[An important fact never mentioned in the **oil industry PR** is that
the minerals in [batteries]{.mark} are [**recharged** and **used for
years**]{.mark}, then **[recycled]{.mark}** [and **reused**]{.mark},
while oil is burned once, and then more oil is mined, transported and
burned, again and again, and this is destroying our
atmosphere.]{.underline}

When EV batteries lose enough of their efficiency to warrant
replacement, the batteries are then useable in stationary applications
such as home or utility energy storage.

At the end of their useful life [the minerals are recycled and reused.
In contrast, the [burning of oil]{.mark} is a onetime use,
and **[requires more oil]{.mark}**, more
**[mining]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} more **[burning]{.mark}**. There is
**no comparison** from an environmental standpoint, even if burning
fossil fuels were not the existential problem that it is.]{.underline}

But **[let's not lose sight of the big picture here]{.underline}**. To
clarify our thinking, [let's assume for the sake of argument the
worst-case scenario, where **we are mining rare minerals**
in a **destructive manner**. But [we must **compare**
this to]{.mark} the ongoing mining, transportation and burning of
oil.]{.underline}

[Huge contaminated fields of **[oil
wells]{.mark}**, **[pipelines]{.mark}**, oil **[wars]{.mark}**,
worldwide shipping and [spillage]{.mark} --- the [**impacts** of oil
mining]{.mark} are [easily a **thousand times greater**]{.mark} than
mineral extraction. Why isn't this mentioned when the supposed hazards
of mineral mining are discussed?]{.underline}

would severely undermine global climate action]{.underline}, according
to mapping and analysis by Rainforest Foundation UK and Earth Insight.

[**[Fossil fuel extraction]{.underline}**,

and in [Africa 30% of oil and gas fields overlap with forests that

capture carbon that helps neutralise human-made greenhouse gas
emissions.

A [staggering 90% of the dense forests under threat from new fossil fuel
investments are in the Congo basin, the world's second largest forest
after the Amazon]{.underline}. This equates to 64m hectares (158m acres)
-- an area twice the size of Germany -- which overlaps with 150 existing

energy]{.mark} and heating options]{.underline}. There was a general
consensus that the perception of nuclear in the North is negative and
there would need to be significant education in order to garner
community buy-in. [From a technical side, there was a general
**[concern]{.mark}** from all the participants [about]{.mark} the
[safety of a **buried reactor**]{.mark} as a fault line runs through the
**territory**]{.underline}. Given the small size of the communities,
there is a concern for ramping up and overproduction.

Public Perception

Public perceptions of nuclear will be the biggest challenge. The
participants noted that people have to be part of the equation and also
the solution. The public perception of nuclear in the Yukon is nuanced.
There is no experience in the North with it and the communities are very
protective of their environment. Some would vehemently oppose the idea
because of the environmental threats and the terrorist threat;
supporters would draw attention to such issues as costs and reliability.
Public consultation would likely produce negative responses, because
these are the groups that would show up. Such consultations would need
to balance environment, economy and the people. Public perception is
highly based on education and the regulatory environment. The Yukon does
not currently provide a regulatory environment for nuclear. It is
imperative that the First Nations are behind it and there is not a great
legacy of benefits coming to them from recent developments. One
participant notes that "will take a lot of social licenses and nuclear
doesn't have it. It needs to be proven". Communities are reluctant to
invest in something that has not been shown to work effectively and
cheaply.

Potential Benefits

[**[Cost]{.mark}** will be [the **biggest
benefit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [cost to **fly diesel**]{.mark} to
remote communities [is]{.mark} extremely [high]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
participant provides an example of the long term cost benefits Old Crow
flies in diesel fuel. A small nuclear system that generates 10 megawatts
when ran at maxium capacity will last 3 years. Run at 3 megawatts, it
will last 30 years. A community like this could have this technology for
30-40 years, drastically reducing their fly-in fuel costs. [In addition
to the fuel cost, there is [also **infrastructure
costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Currently, 50% of diesel systems in the
Yukon are past their life cycles. There will be [significant **costs**
involved [to **replace**]{.mark} these [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There have been conversations around small nuclear in the past. Many of
the participants have attended presentations or meetings on the subject.
[One of the potential benefits of such technology that was often
overlooked during these presentations was the potential use for
heating]{.underline}. [The participants interviewed felt that by
[incorporating **heat**]{.mark} into the equation would be [a major
**selling point**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Risks and Regulations

There was [[**concern** about whether]{.mark} or not [the process could
be **regulated**]{.mark}]{.underline} and risks mitigated effectively in
a small jurisdiction. [There are very **[few]{.mark}** people
**[trained]{.mark}** in the areas necessary for this
technology]{.underline}. There is concern that the people that do have
these skills would be located quite far away if there ever was a crisis.
The North has a track record of adopting energy options without having
the skilled people needed to operate and maintain them, such as the
gasifier in the past. [The regulation side would need a significant
amount of work to include nuclear [and]{.mark} it [would require
**federal support**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That being said, [most
[participants]{.mark} made it clear that they would be **[less
concerned]{.mark}** about the risks, [if]{.mark} the **proper
[regulations]{.mark}** [were in place]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Waste

All participants noted that [the **[top concern]{.mark}** for the
communities [will be **waste**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There is a need
for **greater understanding** of how it is created, [how it is
**stored** or **transported**]{.mark}, and the **environmental impacts**
of each option]{.underline}. One participant stressed how little waste
is actually created, citing the example of how lead-cooled rods can be
almost entirely recycled.
