### 1NC \-\-- Adaptation Fails 

#### Adaptation empirically falls short of solvency and compounds economic hierarchies

Evolution, Environment and Society), Postdoctoral researcher in the
Department of Earth System Science, Stanford University. "Present and
future limits to climate change adaptation." Nature Sustainability.

In the empirical climate--economy literature, adaptation is often
identified using heterogeneity in response functions across space and/or
time1 (Fig. 1). For example, if [we observe the response of human
mortality to extreme temperatures to be strongest in low-income regions
and weakest in high-income regions]{.underline}, even [given similar
exposure of these regions to extreme heat]{.underline} , [we infer that
higher income allows people to purchase air conditioning or work indoor
service-sector jobs rather than outdoor manual labor.]{.underline}
Similarly, if we observe that regions that are more exposed to extreme
heat experience reduced heat-related mortality relative to regions that
are less exposed, we infer that these regions have chosen to invest in
adaptations due to the high returns on such adaptations. These
adaptations may take the form of short-run actions such as turning on an
air-conditioning unit that a person already owns or taking breaks from
outdoor labor in the hottest part of the day. They may also be
longer-run changes such as purchasing a new air-conditioning unit or
migrating to live and work in an entirely different location. The
strategy of using heterogeneity in response functions to identify
adaptation (Fig. 1) generally conflates these timescales, although
particular empirical strategies such as 'long differences' may allow
researchers to assess adaptation on specifically chosen timescales25.
Empirically, mortality is one of the clearest large-scale adaptation
success stories. Mortality from extreme climate events, both heat and
other disasters, has fallen dramatically over time. In the United
States, the effect of extreme heat on mortality has steadily declined,
especially in warm areas8 . Because these warm areas in the southern and
western United States are heavily exposed to extreme heat, they have
chosen to invest in air conditioning, making hot areas less vulnerable
to heat extremes9 . In this regard, [both greater incomes and increased
heat exposure produce adaptation to extreme temperatures]{.underline}
(Fig. 1). More generally, across regions and hazards, the death tolls of
natural disasters have fallen substantially over the past several
decades26. These reductions are strongest in areas with high incomes and
strong political institutions27 as such areas have the resources and
political capacity to safeguard their populations from natural
disasters. [More broadly, **adaptive capacity is observed to be lowest
in low-income areas that may begin from pre-existing positions of
vulnerability, and correspondingly highest in high-income
areas**]{.underline}28. This pattern admittedly presumes an
'assets'-based approach to adaptive capacity, focusing on the economic
or physical resources available to people and societies, and neglects
social organization, hierarchies and other factors that may restrict
people's agencies regardless of their assets[. Alongside the benefits of
income for adaptation, we might expect adaptation to be most extensive
in contexts where actors have high-quality information about their
present and future climates as well as strong incentives to act on that
information]{.underline}. One such context is agriculture in the United
States. Maize yields in the United States do appear adapted to their
local climate as areas with greater extreme heat incidence also
experience reduced impacts from that extreme heat31. Farmers in warmer
areas may choose, for example, to plant cultivars with more
heat-resistant proteins. Evidence is mixed, however, on whether these
adaptations over space will translate into adaptations to a changing
climate. Advances in agricultural technology appear to be flowing to
areas most exposed to extreme heat, potentially reducing the sensitivity
of farm profits to heat32. But the sensitivity of US crop yields does
not appear to have meaningfully declined over the pastseveral decades10,
and areas with stronger climate trends do not appear to have
systematically reduced their extreme heat sensitivity, even in areas
where perception of climate change is highly likely25. Perhaps of more
concern, corn in the United States appears to be growing more sensitive
to drought over time, rather than less, due to crop intensification and
increased planting density33. [There is suggestive evidence of
adaptation in response to climate exposure in other
contexts]{.underline}. Countries that are more frequently exposed to
tropical cyclones experience reduced economic damage from those
cyclones12,34, suggesting that such countries invest in protective
measures such as seawalls, evacuation preparations or early warning
systems. [That being said, cyclone strikes still have devastating
economic effects in these adapted countries, and cyclone damages tend to
rise with income in the United States]{.underline}, **[suggesting that
such adaptations are highly costly or only partially
effective]{.underline}**12,34. Separately, there is an ongoing debate
over whether the effect of temperature shocks on economic growth is
moderated by climate or income; some evidence points towards high-income
countries being insulated from temperature shocks36, while other studies
argue that high-income countries simply lie in a different location on a
single underlying response function15. But regardless of the equivocal
evidence for adaptation in the context of average temperature, income
does not appear to moderate the effects of some other extreme events.
[Within the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, perhaps [the most
highly resourced polity in world history, large economic damages have
been driven by extreme heat and drought as well as rainfall, prima facie
evidence that high incomes and advanced technologies do not insulate us
from environmental stress]{.underline}. And [while the spread of air
conditioning in the United States has moderated the effect of extreme
heat on mortality, it does not appear to have reduced the overall
productivity costs of non-optimal temperatures]{.underline}18. Globally,
the macroeconomic effects of extreme rainfall14 and El Niño13 are
similar in low- and high-income regions, providing additional evidence
that higher incomes do not automatically translate into adaptive
investments. Indeed, in the case of El Niño, the most strongly exposed
countries are also the most strongly affected, rather than the least13.
In addition, while higher average temperatures appear to moderate the
effects of extreme heat on mortality9 and crop yields31, higher average
temperatures appear to intensify the effect of extreme heat on overall
economic growth globally11. Thus, **[across contexts and sectors, the
empirical evidence demonstrates only limited and contingent adaptations
to our current climate]{.underline}**. Why might adaptation be limited?
**[There are some things to which adaptation is simply not
possible]{.underline}**24,39. [Humans and crops face temperature limits
beyond which physiological adaptations generally fail,]{.underline} for
example, and [the inundation of low-lying nations due to sea-level rise
produces damages that cannot be adapted to or recovered]{.underline}42.
**[Even where adaptation is possible, misaligned incentives may
contribute to a lack of adaptation progress]{.underline}**. For example,
crop insurance in the United States allows farmers to recoup
climate-driven losses, [which creates a moral hazard to forgo costly
forward-looking adaptations in favour of receiving indemnity payments
after losses]{.underline}43,44. [Recent extreme events]{.underline},
such as the summer 2012 drought and heat across the contiguous United
States, hav[e therefore led to large and costly crop indemnity payouts
due to yield losses]{.underline}. [A similar misalignment occurs in the
context of the National Flood Insurance Program]{.underline}, which
subsidizes flood insurance premiums across the United States. Because
this programme historically did not incorporate updated
location-specific flood risk estimates into pricing, [the availability
of risk-agnostic flood insurance in high-risk floodplains may have
contributed to a systematic overvaluation of residential properties in
the United States]{.underline}.45. At the time of writing, flooding due
to Hurricane Helene has devastated western North Carolina, a place that
simultaneously has been referred to as a 'climate haven'46 and has been
identified as a hotspot of property overvaluation due to underestimated
flood risk45. Unfortunately, updated flood risk information that might
enable homebuyers to consider climate impacts is often produced by
private climate services firms who aim to profit from this information
and therefore provide it primarily to other firms47. Aligning adaptation
incentives in an equitable way may require the public provision of
climate risk information so that individuals and local governments could
make informed decisions about housing, infrastructure and other
investments48. **[It is also possible that the costs of adaptation are
simply too high]{.underline}**, especially for nations in the Global
South. Critically, [international financial mechanisms have broadly
failed to deliver on targeted adaptation investments to low-income
regions]{.underline}. [**It is estimated that current adaptation finance
is five to ten times below what would be necessary to fund
transformative adaptations**. Low institutional capacity and local power
imbalances in low-income regions also mean that **adaptation funds do
not reach the people who need them**]{.underline}. That is, even in
places where the resources or financial capacity may exist, **[social
hierarchies organized around characteristics such as race, class,
ethnicity or gender identity may undermine the agency of the most
vulnerable to adapt to environmental stress]{.underline}**.

### 2NC \-\-\-- Adaptation Fails 

#### Proper climate mitigation is a prerequisite to cost effective adaptation

Empirical data aside, [it is intuitive that adapting to deadly and
damaging extreme weather events or climate-related shifts will be more
costly than transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Innovation
associated with transition spending scales over time, becoming more
productive at a lower cost. Physical damages from climate change are not
more efficient over time, but rather become more costly as inflation
increases the value of affected assets, including infrastructure, real
estate, and personal property]{.underline}. Our work with climate
scientists at Woodwell Climate Research Center and the MIT Center for
Sustainability Science and Strategy suggests that **[the already
significant costs of adaptation will increase further if mitigation is
delayed, underfunded, or ineffective.]{.underline}** In other words,
[prolonged inaction to decarbonize the economy will exacerbate climate
and extreme weather-driven damages, increase associated costs, and
further the need for investment in adaptation and
resilience.]{.underline}

#### Climate change is moving at a rate where adaption can't be main solution mitigation solves.

So let me be clear about my own position: [[adaptation can't be]{.mark}
the main [answer]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [climate]{.mark}. [There are too
many aspects of climate change]{.mark} that [no]{.mark}
[plausible]{.mark} [adaptation]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [protect]{.mark}
[us]{.mark}]{.underline} from, more so the more warming we allow to
happen. [[Mitigation]{.mark}---especially, ceasing to burn fossil
fuels--- [remains the most]{.mark} [critical]{.mark} [thing we can
do]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the whole planet's [longer-term climate
future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But because some climate change has already happened and more is
certainly coming, we also have to adapt as best we can in order to
reduce the harm it causes. And to do that, we do have to understand how
climate change manifests locally, and how it interacts with all the
diverse dimensions of our societies. It is becoming clearer [[that [we

For several data points, the assessed adaptation option fully
compensates for projected impacts and even to improve outcomes relative
to baseline conditions. We further refer to these additional
improvements as co-benefits, noting that co-benefits beyond the direct
effect of the implemented options are not assessed here. For others,
[[adaptation is ineffective]{.mark} in reducing risk and aggravates the
situation, [thereby leading to maladaptive
outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline} (We use the terms co-benefits and
maladaptation related only to the effect on risk reduction of the
specific adaptation option that is being assessed. In practice and
outside of the modeled environment on which this study is focused, many
additional factors and aspects need to be considered to fully account
for co-benefits or maladaptation.29,30) In between co-beneficial and
maladaptive outcomes, the various degrees of effectiveness consequently
leave different shares of residual impacts. When looking at the full
range of assessed adaptation outcomes, co-benefits appear across all
regions and warming levels, with the exception of warming of 4C in North
America (Figure 4). In general, co-benefits decline with increasing
warming, and there is a shift toward reduced levels of effectiveness.
The overall share of data points able to reduce some share of the
projected impact increases with increasing warming as a consequence of
reduced co-benefits, with options able to reduce an increasingly lower
share of risk. [[The largest reduction in co-beneficial outcomes with
warming is projected for Africa and North America, with an increase in
maladaptive outcomes for both regions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Africa
shows the largest share of maladaptive outcomes at all levels of
warming, which is concerning because Africa is the region with the
largest current adaptation gap,6 and co-benefits would also indicate the
potential for closing this gap. In addition, the share of data points
with a negligible effect increases substantially, with [more than half
of the assessed options]{.mark} either [hav]{.mark}ing [maladaptive or
negligible outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Of the most effective
adaptation options, a total of 48% are able to provide co-benefits.
Shifting to irrigation in previously rainfed systems, for example,
produces co-benefits in multiple cases,31--33 with the highest share of
co-benefits achieved at 1.5C of warming. Maladaptive outcomes are
documented for 4% of options. [The intensification of maize and sorghum
cultivations in West Africa34 or earlier planting of maize in Uganda,33
for example, further decreases yield in addition to projected climate
impacts rather than reducing projected risk, even at 1.5C
warming.]{.underline}

[Local adaptation measures aimed at mitigating climate change can
sometimes produce unintended negative consequences for natural
resources, agriculture, and forests]{.underline}. Research has
demonstrated that while **[community-level [adaptation]{.mark}
strategies are intended to address climate impacts, they [may
inadvertently lead to maladaptation and ecosystem
degradation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, in [Zimbabwe,
adaptation efforts have, paradoxically**, increased the long-term
vulnerability of socio-ecological systems** and reduced their adaptive
capacity]{.underline} (Tanyanyiwa and Madobi, 2017). Similarly, in
[British Columbia, Canada, **genomics-based assisted migration, a forest
adaptation initiative, has been associated with technical failures,
increased opportunity costs, and path dependency, potentially
[undermining its intended benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Findlater et 
al., 2021). Moreover, **[maladaptive responses can [create
self-reinforcing cycles]{.mark}, exacerbating the very climate
challenges they aim to alleviate]{.underline}**. A study of Indonesia's
Sadang watershed revealed that upstream deforestation as a [drought
response not only damaged local ecosystems but also increased downstream
vulnerability by diverting water and creating new hazard]{.underline}s
(Naufal et  al., 2023). In Ghana, agricultural and irrigation expansion
(implemented as an adaptation measure) has contributed to deforestation,
thereby **[disrupting the carbon cycle[, increasing greenhouse gas
emissions, and intensifying climate change
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Antwi-Agyei et  al., 2018).
Similarly, in California, **[drought adaptation efforts have
unintentionally heightened vulnerabilities in other sectors, notably
aquatic ecosystems [and marginalized social
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Christian-Smith et al., 2015).
MassonDelmotte et  al. (2021) states that maladaptive practices in
forest management and natural resource use often result from short-term
solutions that overlook long-term ecological impacts. For instance, some
afforestation projects or land use changes aimed at increasing carbon
sequestration can unintentionally disrupt biodiversity, alter water
cycles, or heighten fire risks. These examples highlight that [local
[adaptation]{.mark} strategies, if not carefully designed and
implemented, [can have far-reaching and detrimental effects on
ecosystems]{.mark}. Such]{.underline} interventions may disturb the
delicate balance between ecosystems and human societies, compromising
essential resources like forests [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} groundwater,
and diminishing ecosystem resilience. Ultimately, these disruptions
[[jeopardize the fundamental well-being of human

//BD

The Afar is a dryland and largely pastoral area (100,860 km2 ) in
Northeastern Ethiopia. Severe recurrent droughts and warming that may
intensify with climate change have hit Afar in the last decade. Efforts
to adapt demonstrate how adaptation-labeled programs that contribute to
rather than challenge current unsustainable development trajectories in
Ethiopia also run the risk of producing poor and/or unintended
consequences.45 Current conceptions of adaptation implies that climate
change, rather than multiple socio-environmental stressors, is
understood to drive vulnerability, and accordingly, that appropriate
policy interventions addressing these climate threats, such as
adjustments in technology, practice, and governance systems, will lead
to adaptation. Multiple social processes, however, make Afar
pastoralists---representing more than 80% of the 1.4 million population
of the Afar region---vulnerable during droughts, including conflicts,
loss of drought grazing areas, loss of livestock, the inability to
migrate in search of water once settled, and the building of a dam for
irrigation that has contributed to flooding of grazing lands and
settlements. Sedentarization and loss of grazing land to agriculture---
mainly sugar cane plantations---have been ongoing for decades and have
intensified over the past few years. The massive losses of livestock are
undermining the integrity of the whole pastoral livelihood system,
leading to impoverishment and increased vulnerability in the face of
recurrent droughts. Since 2010, regional adaptation policies for Afar
promote investment in irrigation agriculture and nonpastoral
livelihoods. Such measures result in some people migrating further for
grazing, which sometimes reinforces conflict with other groups, and many
shifting out of pastoralism into very marginal livelihoods, including
trade and charcoal production. [Although some influential individuals
are shifting to irrigation agriculture, this livelihood is highly
unreliable both in terms of economic viability and exposure to climate
variability and change. It also further undermines [the **adaptive
capacity**]{.mark} **of the community by converting important drought
grazing lands to private agricultural land. Hence, [social
differentiation and vulnerability are
reinforced]{.mark}.**]{.underline}The case exemplifies the critical
issues of the multiple drivers and the process of maladaptation. It
indeed shows how adaptation policies do not question which development
goals are furthered by adaptation measures. Instead, [official
adaptation efforts dovetail neatly with
modernization]{.underline}---that is, sedentarization of pastoralists
and expansion of irrigation farming---[as an uncontested development
pathway. A climate-change centered understanding of [adaptation]{.mark},
although it first leads to reducing the threat of climate change, also
**[carries the risk of neglecting---even sometimes reinforcing---the
multiple drivers of vulnerability, thus increasing the risk of
maladaptation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Maladaptation, as a potential consequence, comprises nominally
climate-adaptive actions that have perverse or unintended effects at
odds with broader climate-related policy goals (Barnett & O\'Neill,
2010; Juhola et al., 2016; Magnan et al., 2016; Noble et al., 2014), and
is distinct from ecological or evolutionary concepts of maladaptation at
the species level.]{.underline} Actions may be maladaptive, for
instance, because they increase climate vulnerability in unanticipated
ways, redistribute damages inequitably or exacerbate climate change.
Magnan et al. (2016) detail [four cases of **[adaptation]{.mark} gone
wrong including, for instance, a project to increase the climate
resilience of transportation infrastructure in south-west Bangladesh
that [has the unintended consequence of further encouraging habitation
of climatically vulnerable areas]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Conceptual
frameworks for understanding maladaptation are thought to help
decision-makers identify and avoid it by providing them with tools to
assess the risk that adaptive actions will produce negative outcomes.
Magnan et al. (2016) argue that practitioners have not paid enough
attention to potential maladaptation risks, in part because these
frameworks are not necessarily designed to be anticipatory. [Barnett and
O\'Neill (2010) created perhaps the most influential maladaptation
framework, conceiving of five types, where **[climate-adaptive]{.mark}
actions may (a) [increase greenhouse gas]{.mark} emissions; (b) [create
a disproportionate burden on vulnerable groups]{.mark}; (c) [incur high
opportunity costs]{.mark}; (d) [reduce the incentive to adapt]{.mark};
or (e) [create path dependence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The IPCC AR5 more
narrowly defined maladaptation in relation to outcomes for climate
vulnerability (Noble et al., 2014). More recently, Juhola et al. (2016)
[proposed a typology of maladaptation with three categories (rebounding
vulnerability, shifting vulnerability and more broadly eroding
sustainable development),]{.underline} while Magnan et al. (2016)
highlighted the need to proactively assess the risks of maladaptation in
four dimensions (process, multiple drivers, temporal scales and spatial
scales). Though these maladaptation frameworks differ in detail, all of
the authors agree that it remains under-conceptualized, that there is
too little empirical evidence in the literature to understand it
properly and that climatesensitive decision-makers need to be more
proactive in avoiding it. [[Climate adaptations]{.mark} that are
undertaken without consideration of these broader concerns [risk

[Maladaptation is used to describe "actions or inactions that may lead
to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, increased
vulnerability to climate change, or diminished welfare, now or in the
future"]{.underline} (Noble et al., 2014; p. 857). Maladaptation either
increases the vulnerability of the target group or another group to
existing or future climate variability (Barnett and O'Neill, 2010).
Magnan et al. (2016) presented case studies from the Maldives, Ethiopia,
South Africa, and Bangladesh and highlighted four main dimensions in
assessing the risk of maladaptation -- i) process, ii) multiple drivers,
iii) temporal scales, and iv) spatial scales. Juhola et al. (2016)
advanced the scholarship by providing a typology for assessing
maladaptation. This paper extends the literature on adaptation and
maladaptation by providing empirical evidence to enhance understanding
of how coping and [adaptation practices can deliver maladaptive outcomes
in vulnerability hotspots using in-depth case study analyses in northern
Ghana]{.underline}. An increasing body of work has focused on
identifying and assessing specific adaptation and coping strategies
employed by farming households to reduce the adverse impacts of drought
linked to climate change on livelihoods of households (see examples
Bawakyillenuo et al., 2016; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2014; Codjoe et al.,
2012). Other studies including Yaro et al. (2014) and Berman et al.
(2012) have explored how local institutions can be strengthened to
facilitate climate change adaptation in dryland farming systems. Further
studies have focused on the role of local indigenous knowledge in
reducing the adverse impacts of climate change on the livelihoods of
farming households (see Codjoe et al., 2014; Speranza et al., 2010;
Nyong et al., 2007). Whilst these studies document a growing body of
knowledge on appropriate adaptation strategies, studies relating to how
these adaptation practices can be framed to deliver development benefits
and improve adaptive capacities of households to respond to future
climatic vulnerabilities remain limited. Some
[**[adaptation]{.mark}/coping [strategies]{.mark} potentially
[compromise the ability]{.mark} of households [to respond to existing
and future climate change and lead to lock-in effects]{.mark}, [which
can]{.mark} "shoehorn communities into positive or negative pathways of
change**"]{.underline} (Wilson, 2014, p. 1). Using a social resilience
framework, Wilson (2014, p.11) identified [structural lock-in effects
such as moral codes that "define the philosophical basis upon which
community actions take place and usually find expression through
traditions and specific rites".]{.underline} [Political lock-ins relate
to power structures and decision making within a community and reflect
the political pathways of individuals or groups in the community, which
can [lead to implementation of superior alternative community
pathways]{.mark} (Davidson, 2010). Economic lock-in effects are directly
linked to economic capital within the community and the [effects of
globalisation on a community's resilience]{.mark} (Wilson, 2014).
Socio-psychological lock-ins are closely associated with
"[community-level endogenous social and psychological factors]{.mark}"
(Wilson, 2014, p. 16). This paper has explored how climate change coping
and adaptation responses can sometimes [lead to maladaptive
outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Findings identified the key climatic and
socioeconomic stressors that adversely influence agricultural systems in
northern Ghana. Socioeconomic stressors included lack of access and high
cost of farm inputs, labour shortages and population growth whilst the
climatic stressors included erratic rainfall, high temperatures,
droughts and floods. The paper demonstrated that climatic and
nonclimatic factors interact to affect agricultural practices. In terms
of coping and adaptation measures, the study identified various options
including extensification and intensification of agriculture, temporary
migration, planting of drought resistant varieties, mulching etc.
[Advancing the work of Juhola et al. (2016), the paper has demonstrated
with empirical evidence three types of maladaptive outcomes that are
occurring in the study communities: rebounding vulnerability, shifting
vulnerability and eroding sustainable development.]{.underline} These
findings suggest that climate change adaptation policy should be devised
in a manner that enhances household adaptive capacity in the short term
whilst promoting their development benefits in the long-term. It is
vital that development partners and policy makers develop appropriate
and robust indicators to assess the long-term effects of various climate
change adaptation actions in order to reduce maladaptation. This paper
contributes to the burgeoning literature on adaptation and climate risk
management by providing empirical evidence to enhance understanding of
how coping and adaptations measures are delivering maladaptive outcomes
in vulnerable communities of northern Ghana.

costs for anyone, anywhere, even though this is always the goal.
Importantly, using maladaptation to describe shifting vulnerability and
negative externalities ultimately does not highlight the crucial problem
that each adaptation intervention has the potential to backfire on the
very people who are supposed to be benefitting from it, which should
actually be completely preventable. Nevertheless, drawing lines between
different experiences proves to be difficult, and many cases of
maladaptation will also have negative implications for people outside
the immediate beneficiary group, and can increase vulnerability not just
to climate change, but to many other threats as well.

An examination of agricultural climate insurance shows that farmers with
insurance change the way they use their land or interact differently
with networks that they had previously relied on to reduce the risk
posed by climate. These changes include a focus on insured cash crops
over drought-resistant subsistence crops, intercropping, or moisture
conservation techniques, meaning that the farmers become reliant on the
insurance. Furthermore, **[without the need to weigh the risks of
planting different crops on a seasonal basis, [farmers]{.mark} are [no
longer]{.mark} [engag]{.mark}ing [with their previous networks]{.mark},
thereby [reducing the overall knowledge]{.mark} base, [social
capital]{.mark}, and [risk awareness necessary to mitigate the
uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., Muller et al, 2017 € ).

**[Adapting to climate change involves changes in attitudes and
behavior, which is likely more important than physical or institutional
changes]{.underline}**. The strategy of switching from chickens to ducks
mentioned earlier, for instance, is only possible if people accept
changing their diets to eat duck eggs and meat. But not all behavioral
changes turn out well. A study in northern Ghana looking at how farming
communities were responding to climate change shows how farmers were
temporarily migrating away from rural areas in search of employment due
to the insecurity caused by lack of rainfall. But this strategy, while
diversifying incomes and reducing pressure on food reserves, ends up
creating labor shortages so that when farming conditions are good, there
are not enough people available to ensure a successful harvest.
Consequently, **[the act of migrating makes farming even more difficult,
and changes societal structures [introducing new dynamics and
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., Antwi-Agyei et al, 2018). In
sum, adaptation and maladaptation must be seen as a continuum, where the
outcomes range from an ideal transformation toward a climate-resilient
pathway on the one side, to irreversibly higher vulnerability on the
other (Figure 2). While we have numerous examples of maladaptation
around the world, it continues to happen, and the shift between
adaptation and maladaptation can be subtle and rapid.
**[Similarly]{.underline}**, **[[a strategy can have some positive
outcomes but]{.mark} [still]{.mark} [result in
maladaptation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Adapting to [climate
change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/climate-change)
is necessary to ensure that the impacts will not overwhelm societies and
ecosystems around the world. But **[planning [adaptation]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} an exercise]{.underline} [in
[uncertain]{.mark}ty]{.underline}**, and built on imperfect information,
many **[[adaptation]{.mark} strategies fail.]{.underline}** Some go even
further**[[, creating conditions that]{.mark} actually [worsen]{.mark}
the [situation]{.mark};]{.underline}** this **[is called
[[maladaptation]{.mark}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/maladaptation)]{.underline}**.
Aside from wasting time and money, maladaptation **[[is]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} [proces]{.mark}]{.underline}**[s]{.mark} through which
**[[people]{.mark} [become]{.mark} even [more]{.mark}
[vulnerable]{.mark} to [climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Poor planning is the primary cause of maladaptation, yet the diverse
manifestations are complex, and identifying maladaptation in advance
with certainty is difficult. Nevertheless, there is now sufficient
experience to give an indication of how maladaptation can take place,
the contexts that may be more prone to such an outcome, and the design
flaws in strategies that need to be avoided. Until adaptation projects
directly address the drivers of vulnerability, however, maladaptation
will continue to be a risk**[. [Climate

will not happen rapidly enough to avoid serious and irreversible
damages[.]{.mark} The Earth has already **[warmed by 1°C above

[suggests]{.mark} that, at [the]{.mark} [current]{.mark} [rate]{.mark}
[of emissions, warming]{.mark} [will]{.mark} [hit 1.5°C]{.mark} sometime
[in]{.mark} the next [30]{.mark} [years]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
consequences of this warming include **[more extreme weather events,
[loss]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [health]{.mark} and functioning of
[major]{.mark} [ecosystems]{.mark}, and other biophysical changes that
have [adverse
outcomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/adverse-outcome)

[livelihoods]{.mark}, [[food

[[water]{.mark}

human securi]{.mark}ty, and [economic]{.mark}
[growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Because these impacts are already being
felt, [finding
ways](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/wayfinding)
to adjust societies to the changing climate is necessary. For example,
to address unreliable rain and [water
scarcity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/water-scarcity),
farmers can harvest rainwater, improve the efficiency of their
[irrigation
systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/irrigation-system)
and switch to less water-intense crops. These *adaptation measures* are
often things that farmers already have in their arsenal of strategies to
deal with the uncertainty and risk of farming, and the adaptation needs
may be mainly about know-how or technology. In other sectors, however,
it is necessary to identify new approaches, or change processes
altogether. Adaptation to climate change has as a result become an
entire area of research and practice, and governments around the world
have developed adaptation policies, plans, and programs. Designing
adaptation strategies to ensure changes to the climate do no or only
minimal harm may seem straightforward enough. In the worst case, they
will be ineffective and a waste of financial resources, right? Actually,
no. **[[Poorly]{.mark} [designed]{.mark} [adaptation]{.mark} strategies
can [result]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [*mal*adaptation]{.mark},]{.underline}**
where exposure and sensitivity to [climate change
impacts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/climate-change-impact)
are instead increased as a result of action taken. Maladaptation is thus
not just a waste of time and money; it is when an action results in
**[conditions that are worse than those which the original strategies
were trying to address[. Maladaptation is]{.mark} therefore [not being
poorly adapted to climate change]{.mark};]{.underline}** it is actually
a process whereby people become **[even more likely to be negatively
affected by climate change]{.underline}**. Although [decision
makers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/decision-maker)
and practitioners are aware of the need to avoid maladaptation,
historically the science of maladaptation has been generally ineffective
when it comes to identifying reliable ways to determine, with certainty,
when a specific adaptation strategy is heading down an undesirable
route. Today, however, we have sufficient experience, with both
development and adaptation projects, to provide at least some indication
of scenarios in which maladaptation can take place, the institutional
and actor arrangements most susceptible to maladaptation, and strategy
design flaws to avoid. The Challenge of Adapting to Climate Change
Decades of dealing with the impacts of disasters have taught us that,
while humans have some ability to absorb and recover from extreme
weather events, losses and damages can set economic and social
development back years---even decades. As a result, there is an
acknowledgment that strategic and deliberate measures need to be taken
to ensure that human societies can progress despite climate change. With
this in mind, human adaptation has been defined as a process involving
changes and choices that seek to protect individuals and societies from
[adverse
effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/adverse-effect)
of climate change, to allow them to function and attain
[wellbeing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/wellbeing)
under changing climatic conditions. This refers both to experienced
climate change, as well as to anticipated future changes. A good example
of an adaptation strategy in the case of
[flooding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/flood)
is from Bangladesh, where chickens kept for eggs and meat were replaced
with ducks, who, unlike chickens, can swim during floods, since people
kept losing their poultry when it would flood. This
[livestock](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/farm-animal)
switch is now in fact becoming common in the low-lying flood-prone
country. But there are many uncertain dimensions to climate change that
make the outcome of responses to impacts---whether planned deliberately,
or actions that develop organically in reaction to the
impacts---difficult to predict. For example, if people are relocated
from coastal areas to avoid being flooded or affected by storm surges,
these hazards will no longer pose a threat; however, if they are fishers
their coastal access may be constrained, resulting in the inability to
keep a protective eye on their boats and fishing equipment, with adverse
impacts on incomes and livelihood security. Or if people are given money
to rebuild their homes after an extreme storm, they may decide to
continue living in the rubble and use the money for other things, such
as purchasing new livestock or a vehicle. The challenge with studying
and understanding adaptation is that it is a *process*as much as it is
an *outcome*. This is because the climate continues to change, with some
known but significantly more unknown consequences for natural and human
systems. Furthermore, multiple factors aside from climate influence how
effective an adaptation strategy can be, many of which are also changing
over time, such as the global economy. As a consequence, if farmers in
increasingly dry areas seeking to move away from thirsty cash crops,
such as sugarcane, rice, wheat, or cotton that have reliable markets,
toward drought-tolerant crops, such as sorghum and
[millet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/panicum-miliaceum),
this can be a costly and time-consuming investment that may initially
hold promise, but potentially fail as a result of [market
volatility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/market-volatility)
and diet trends. This can be seen in [Figure
1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332220304838#fig1),
where an adaptive strategy can become maladaptive over time. Figure 1. A

#### Farmer adaptation creates a rebound vulnerability and shifts vulnerability in the agriculture system

)//BD

[[Adaptation]{.mark} strategies also [rebound vulnerability by
decreasing adaptive capacity and increasing exposure and
vulnerability]{.mark} of implementing actors.]{.underline} For instance,
coping strategies, such as reduction in size and number of meals, affect
health and nutritional status of households, particularly children and
the elderly. This corroborates studies that associated nutritional and
health challenges of children to inadequate meals intake (FAO, IFAD,
UNICEF, WFP, & WHO, 2017; Jaffee et al., 2019). Indeed, the risks
associated with farmers adaptation strategies concur with Mateo-Sagasta
(2020) that farmers' current agricultural practices have grave negative
impact on sustainable development efforts. Based on [Juhola et al.'s
(2016) typologies of maladaptation, it is evident that some of the
[adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers erode sustainable
development, rebound and shift vulnerability]{.mark}. This has the
potential to [affect farmers' capacity to respond to future climate and
environmental change]{.mark}. Maladaptation outcomes that erode
sustainable development release greenhouse gases and create
socioeconomic and environmental problems across a wider geographical
scope.]{.underline} Farmers' adaptation strategies that erode
sustainable development included application of agrochemicals,
agriculture extensification/expansion and intensification as well as
sales of assets. Agriculture intensification, for instance, increases
the use of agrochemicals, such as fertilizers, weedicides, and
pesticides among the farmers, which affects sources of drinking water
for communities and increases greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the
cost associated with agrochemicals increases the financial burden of
smallholder farmers in the study area and reduces their ability to
respond to future shocks and stressors. This findings corroborate
Antwi-Agyei et al. (2018) who noted that the high cost of agrochemicals
affects vulnerability of farmers in Northern Ghana. Agrochemicals with
nitrogen content also contribute to global warming. and climate change
by releasing greenhouse gases (Stehfest et al., 2010). Thus the
contribution of agrochemicals to global warming negatively affects
exposure and sensitivity to climate shocks in smallholder agriculture
systems. Agrochemicals have health implications, disrupt freshwater
ecosystem services and create common pool resource challenges in the
farming community, which is consistent with previous studies
(Nyantakyi-Frimpong et al., 2016; Obeng-Odoom and Gyampo, 2017; Pittock,
2011). Intuitively, **[[adaptation strategies]{.mark}, such as
agrochemical application, have the propensity to result in multiple
maladaptation outcomes, which supports the study's argument that an
adaptation strategy may not necessarily lead to a single/overall
maladaptation outcome but [can result in multiple counterproductive
outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Farm expansion among the farmers also
encourages deforestation, slashing and burning and agrochemicals
application as well as strains common pool resources, such as forest.
The practice also puts stress on water for agriculture and domestic
purposes and increases greenhouse gases emissions from agriculture.
Slash and burning is associated with the release of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere, which intensifies global warming and climate change
(IPCC, 2014, 2018). Similarly, the quest to expand farmlands among the
farmers also contributes to deforestation through the removal of trees
and land covers, thereby exposing farmlands to erosion. This confirms
Hosonuma et al.'s (2012) argument that agriculture extensification
contributes significantly to deforestation, particularly in dry land
farming systems. Livelihood diversification, such as sales of livestock
and land, reduces the stock of assets of smallholder farmers, thereby
increasing their vulnerability to future climate shocks and stressors.
Thus, there is a high tendency that sales of asset may aggravate poverty
of vulnerable communities during severe climate hazards (Haggblade et
al., 2010; Wilson, 2014). Furthermore, irrigation shifts vulnerability
by creating social tension and conflict among farmers, due to competing
demand for limited water resources. Solh & Ginkel (2014) contend that
irrigation in dry land areas has been a major source of conflict,
particularly between herders and crop farmers. Consistent with
Lopez-Ridaura et al. (2018), irrigation is capital intensive, which
financially burdens farmers in the district, thereby affecting their
capacity to respond to climate change. [Adaptation strategies also
rebound vulnerability by decreasing adaptive capacity and increasing
exposure and vulnerability of implementing actors.]{.underline} For
instance, coping strategies, such as reduction in size and number of
meals, affect health and nutritional status of households, particularly
children and the elderly. This corroborates studies that associated
nutritional and health challenges of children to inadequate meals intake
(FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, & WHO, 2017; Jaffee et al., 2019). [Indeed, the
risks associated with farmers adaptation strategies concur with
Mateo-Sagasta (2020) that farmers' current agricultural practices have

#### Indigenous knowledge collab won't solve -- needs international coordination.

Pg 3. LJS

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of the
twenty-first century. [[To avert catastrophic]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}, international society [needs]{.mark} to take urgent,
and **[internationally coordinated, action]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Although virtually all nations are united in their desire to tackle the
man-made causes of global warming, they have yet to reverse the
long-term trend of rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Covid-19
pandemic provided temporary relief in that it led to a drop in global
emissions by up to 7% in 2020 (UNEP, 2020), but the post-pandemic
economic recovery seems likely to return the world to a path of rising
emissions again. [As yet, states' climate policy intentions and emission
pledges have proved to be inadequate. Climate change is a truly global
problem, requiring all nations to undertake mitigation and adaptation
measures]{.underline}. At the same time, the responsibility for causing
the problem is unequally distributed, as is the capacity to respond to
the climate threat in an effective manner. Two-thirds of current global
emissions originate from just 10 major economies, and by and large it is
the same countries that also have the economic and technological clout
to develop and finance the required global solutions. Climate change and
international power inequality are thus closely entwined. [Indeed, if
the major emitters were to act decisively and in a coordinated manner,
the chances of averting a climate catastrophe would be much improved. By
the same token, [**even if only some**]{.mark} of them [fail]{.mark} or
refuse to act responsibly, [the world faces a bleak
future.]{.mark}]{.underline} The International Relations (IR) literature
on global environmental politics (GEP) has tended to acknowledge,
implicitly at least, the important role that a few select major powers
play, either as international leaders that set an example for others and
shape international environmental agendas, or as veto players that block
progress in multilateral environmental negotiations (Kelemen and Vogel,
2010; Liefferink and Wurzel, 2017; Eckersley, 2020). GEP scholarship has
also highlighted the inherent inequalities that structure the
environmental policy area, both within societies and between them, and
especially with regard to unequal levels of economic development and
consumption levels (Roberts and Parks, 2007; Ciplet, Roberts, and Khan,
2015). However, questions of power asymmetry in international
environmental politics, the nature of states' environmental power, what
counts as a great power in the environmental field, and whether great
environmental power comes with special responsibilities have not
attracted the kind of systematic attention in GEP that they deserve.
This book seeks to fill that gap. By connecting the IR literature on
great powers and great power responsibility with GEP scholarship, it
develops a new analytical perspective on international power inequality
and the role of environmental great powers in GEP, with a special focus
on international climate politics. The contributions to this volume
develop and apply a conceptual framework for the study of environmental
great powers and their special international responsibilities. They
examine how individual great powers have responded to the global climate
challenge and whether they have accepted a special responsibility for
stabilizing the global climate. And they place emerging discourses on
great power responsibility in the context of wider debates about
international environmental leadership and climate change
securitization. Great Powers and the Global Climate Challenge [The
urgency of the climate change problem is now well understood. Man-made
global warming, which is caused by GHG emissions from the burning of
fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) and land use changes (e.g. deforestation),
has already led to a 1°C increase of average global temperatures since
pre-industrial times. If current net emission trends continue unabated,
the world is likely to face a global warming trend of between 3°C and
5°C by the end of the twenty-first century]{.underline}. The ecological
consequences of such runaway global warming would be catastrophic. If
left unchecked, climate change is expected to result in the melting of
glaciers and rising sea levels, more extreme weather patterns, heat
waves and wild fires even in arctic lands, the destruction of
biologically diverse ecosystems, and changes in the amount, frequency,
and intensity of precipitation. Some of these changes are already
occurring (disappearance of glaciers, coral bleaching, wildfires) while
others will only kick in at a later stage. [The challenge for humanity
is that the longer global warming is allowed to carry on, the stronger
future ecological stresses will be and the sooner we may reach
**ecological tipping points that lock in large-scale and irreversible
environmental damage** (Lenton et al., 2019; Dalby, 2020).]{.underline}
International society has recognized the threat that global warming
poses to human well-being and prosperity. What is unclear, however, is
whether the UN's multilateral climate regime can quickly enough come up
with an effective response. [The [197 countries]{.mark} that negotiated
the 2015 Paris Agreement to the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) agreed to keep global warming to well below 2°C. In
order to stay within this temperature target, they will [need to bring
GHG emissions under control]{.mark}, first by reaching a global
emissions peak as soon as possible and then by bringing them down to
reach a balance between GHG emissions and sinks (so-called net zero) by
the second half of this century. All of this is to be achieved
[through]{.mark} a system of [voluntary climate mitigation
pledges]{.mark} that are to be reviewed internationally]{.underline}.
The key question is whether the Paris Agreement's framework for
ratcheting up national climate ambitions can set the world on the path
towards deep decarbonization, and within a timeframe that keeps global
warming below 2°C (Falkner, 2016b). [The past record of multilateral
efforts is far from encouraging. **[Issue complexity, institutional
inertia, and diverging national interests]{.mark} have turned climate
change into a 'wicked' global problem that seems to [exceed the
problem-solving capacity of environmental multilateralism]{.mark}**
(Levin et al., 2012; Keohane and Victor, 2016).]{.underline}

In the past few years[, [I've become skeptical that]{.mark} academia and
institutions like [the IPCC will truly embrace Indigenous]{.mark}
peoples, much less the [knowledge]{.mark} that we carry]{.underline}
about the natural world. I left a tenured professor track role because
of the inability of academia and western institutions to meaningfully
incorporate Indigenous knowledge. [[Within academia]{.mark}, [Indigenous
knowledge is]{.mark} largely [only valued when it confirms the
conclusions of western science]{.mark}. When it conflicts or disagrees
with western science it is often discarded or ignored]{.underline}. The
Indigenous knowledge that's accepted by academics is often published in
peer reviewed journals, which might as well lock this information in a
vault for the communities providing the information. [[It is largely
written in inaccessible academic jargon]{.mark} and hidden behind
expensive paywalls]{.underline}. I know because I've published a number
of open access journal articles and sent thousands of dollars to
publishers to make perspectives from my own community accessible[.
[Indigenous knowledge tends to be localized]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
holistic, [while western science's approach is highly
specialized]{.mark}, and seeks universal truths. In many respects these
different orientations can make threading these knowledge systems
together fundamentally impossible]{.underline}. It's not surprising that
the global focus on reducing carbon emissions has been characterized by
some academics as "carbon tunnel vision." Responses to climate change
tend to neglect the other elements of this equation, like addressing
biodiversity challenges, environmental toxicity, and the broader
socio-political and cultural changes needed to make solutions feasible.
[[The most recent IPCC report acknowledges that Indigenous knowledge
systems could]{.mark} help [provide]{.mark} the [critical framework to
bridge]{.mark} these interconnected [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But using the phrase of Kimaren ole Riamit, a Maasai scholar, these are
just "pretty words" on a piece of paper. They don't mean much without
action. [[The trust needed to meaningfully incorporate Indigenous
knowledge into policy doesn't exist]{.mark}. Building equal
relationships on the heels of hundred years of colonization is not a
quick process]{.underline}, and time is running out. [[It will take
longer to implement a fully justice-informed approach to the climate
crisis]{.mark} than the time we have to address the worst impacts of
climate change]{.underline}. We have already crossed thresholds of
irreversible impacts for some Indigenous people[. I have seen how the
warming of the Arctic has permanently displaced entire villages and
disrupted thousands of years of cultural traditions and ways of
knowing]{.underline}. In my home community, I have witnessed large
swaths of rangeland turn to sand dunes and medicinal plants I once
collected move to higher latitudes and elevations due to warming
temperatures and two decades of drought.

The [connection of climate claims to human rights is]{.underline}
becoming [clear]{.underline}er,3 thanks in part to human rights bodies'
recent work on states' human rights obligations in relation to climate
change.4 This interpretative work has shown that state obligations
associated with ESCR -- such as the right to adequate housing, food,
water or health -- are of high relevance in relation to climate change,
[particularly requiring states to take preventive measures to reduce the
impacts of climate change]{.underline} on the enjoyment of these rights
and to provide remedies if harms have occurred.5 In this chapter we
approach human rights -- civil and political, along with economic,
social and cultural -- as an integral set of interconnected norms that
seek to protect the dignity of the human person without discriminations
of any kind. Thus in this chapter we use 'human rights-based climate
litigation' and 'ESCR litigation' indistinctively. According to the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),
at the national level states have an obligation to protect people from
the harmful effects of climate change. This includes an obligation to
adopt a legal and institutional framework that assists those within
their jurisdiction to adapt to the effects of climate change. While
states have some discretion to decide on the adaptation measures they
adopt, they should ensure that they result from a process that provides
for informed public participation; take into account national and
international standards; are neither retrogressive nor discriminatory;
and are implemented once adopted.6 With respect to mitigation, since the
dangerous accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere -- which
threatens ESCR -- responds to cumulative processes over a long period,
the reduction cannot occur by the mitigation efforts of a single state.
States, therefore, have obligations under human rights law to mitigate
their own emissions,7 within the frame of the duty of international
cooperation.8 [The]{.underline} UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change ([UNFCCC)]{.underline} [Conference of the Parties]{.underline}
(COP) [has]{.underline} officially [recognized]{.underline} that the
adverse effects of climate change affect the enjoyment of human rights
and [that the effects of climate change will]{.underline} most strongly
[affect those who are already vulnerable due to]{.underline} geography,
gender, age, [indigenous]{.underline} or minority [status]{.underline}
and disability.9 For example, [environmental injustice puts]{.underline}
current and future [vulnerable populations at higher risk of climate
change]{.underline}-related health burdens such as waterborne disease
and potentially new diseases arising out of a warmer climate and
changing living conditions.10 And people living in poverty in
disaster-prone areas, or who are forced to migrate for climate-related
reasons, are even more vulnerable to harm from more intense and more
frequent storms, hurricanes and droughts, as well as from pandemics like
the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus (whether these are climate-related or
not).11

[As climate damages intensify, people and governments may face
incentives for adaptation that they have not previously faced,
accelerating adaptation progress]{.underline}. In addition, as secular
trends in technology and productivity enable greater economic output,
resilience to climate stress may similarly increase[. But these trends
may not be enough. There is ample evidence to suggest that the
consequences of climate change may make adaptation more]{.underline},
rather than less, [difficult]{.underline}. Here, again, [this
Perspective focuses on a capability-based definition of adaptive
capacity, which emphasizes that financial resources]{.underline} and
other assets enable actors to undertake adaptations such as installing
air conditioning. Resources are only one component of an agent's
adaptive capacity, which also depends on factors such as their social
position, willingness to undertake transformative actions and risk
perceptions. [However, a resources-based focus is consistent with other
treatments of adaptation in the climate economics field and provides a
tractable way to understand the relationship between climate damages and
adaptation]{.underline}. [Consider the example of mortality. Adaptations
that reduce the mortality effects of extreme heat at present have
depended on the widespread adoption of air conditioning]{.underline} .
Air conditioning depends Global temperature change Economic damages
Intensification Adaptation • Economic damages undermine income used to
adapt • Climate-driven international crises distract financing and
effort • Physiological thresholds in people and agriculture are exceeded
• Rising incomes enable adaptation investments • Intensified climate
exposure increases motivation for adaptation • Innovation responds to

in the damage function over time. Schematized change in climate damages
over time. The black line shows a hypothetical historical damage
function, the red line shows the damage function under the
intensification hypothesis, and the blue line shows the damage function
under the adaptation hypothesis. Text boxes outline arguments for each
hypothesis. on consistent electricity access, and [as climate change
increases extreme heat incidence, demand for electricity is likely to
increase substantially. Rising energy demand means additional costs and
potential financial stress for households that cannot afford those
costs. Extreme heat events have already led utilities to disconnect the
electricity of some low-income households, and future heatwaves might
result in additional disconnections that further undermine access to air
conditioning]{.underline}. This problem worsens when the overall
vulnerability of the electricity system is considered. Much of the power
generation in the United States depends on access to water, either for
cooling thermal power generation or for directly producing hydropower.
As climate change raises water temperatures and reduces streamflow,
power generation may need to be curtailed substantially56. Loss of power
generation during heatwaves could amplify the effects of such heatwaves
and greatly increase morbidity and mortality risk57. This threat becomes
more severe when compounding hazards are considered, such as tropical
cyclones followed by heatwaves; if a cyclone disrupts energy
infrastructure and causes a blackout58, air conditioning will not
mitigate the mortality risks of extreme heat that may follow such a
storm. [These and other limits to adaptation grow more severe when one
considers other compound and interconnected risks]{.underline}59. For
example, [international trade has been proposed as an adaptation option
in the context of food security]{.underline}: reductions in agricultural
production in one area may be compensated by surpluses in other areas60.
[But globally synchronized production shocks compromise such trade
networks by damaging crops worldwide, making it difficult to compensate
one area's losses with surpluses from another]{.underline}. Given the
rise of globally synchronized heat and drought due to anthropogenic
forcing, simultaneous 'breadbasket failure' may challenge trade networks
and jeopardize global food security62. This two-way interaction between
climate damages and adaptation is additionally important in the context
of migration. [Migration has been framed at times as an important
adaptation strategy, allowing people to move from highly vulnerable
areas to less vulnerable ones. Spatial economic models incorporating
migration find that it reduces climate damages relative to a world in
which people do not move]{.underline}22. Critically, however, climate
change is not merely a potential driver of the aspiration to migrate; it
may also reduce the capability to migrate by undermining economic
resources available to the poorest populations64. And even when people
do migrate, they may face greater danger along their route, such as
escalating heat and water stress due to climate change along the
US--Mexico border65. **[Together, these risks demonstrate how the direct
and indirect effects of climate change may counteract adaptations that
have been successful to date]{.underline}**. More broadly, **[climate
change may undermine the precise monetary and institutional resources
that are themselves critical to adaptation]{.underline}**. If long-run
economic growth is slowed by rising temperatures17, more-intense
tropical cyclones12 or more-frequent El Niño events13, societies may not
have the resources or democratic stability to access the international
funds that enable adaptation50. **[Every dollar spent on recovery
efforts for an unprecedented tropical cyclone or drought is another
dollar that cannot be spent installing air conditioning, putting houses
on stilts or building seawalls]{.underline}**. The negative impacts of
climate change on economic activity may additionally reduce tax revenue
for governments, undermining their ability to provide services to their
citizens. **[As a result, nations or regions may be locked into vicious
cycles of 'adaptation-constrained' development pathways that prevent
responses to future crises]{.underline}**66, especially if developing
countries are unable to increase tax revenue to support social services,
strong state capacity and broader development67. [The physical risks of
climate change are also likely to generate political crises that may
undermine coordinated action]{.underline}. When potential economic
stagnation or decline is combined with stressors such as increased
disease risk68 and civil conflict69, the result may be political
instability and the rise of right-wing populist leaders70. Such leaders
may be resistant to coordinated action on climate resilience and instead
embrace a 'fortress mentality' that undermines adaptation finance and
international trade, jeopardizing the safety of migrants and food
security and potentially increasing other risks. **[Like underlying
constraints on adaptation, these effects of climate damages on adaptive
capacity will likely be structured not only by income or assets but also
by existing social hierarchies and inequalities]{.underline}**. [If
climate damages widen global income inequality, income-based constraints
are likely to be most severely felt in the lowest-income countries that
have contributed least to warming]{.underline}. Such constraints also
manifest in the lived experience of an individual. For example, in rural
areas, [women are frequently tasked with the arduous and often dangerous
task of gathering water.]{.underline} Water gathering is likely to
become more difficult and time-consuming as warming reduces surface
water availability in some regions, [further constraining the time and
independence of women relative to men]{.underline}. This example
illustrates that even given a certain level of assets or material
resources, **[the lived adaptive capacity of an individual may be shaped
by how characteristics such as their gender identity intersect with
existing social structures]{.underline}**. Finally, each of these
[effects may be exacerbated by potential negative externalities from
private adaptation actions]{.underline}. For example, several recent
studies have highlighted that a common adaptation strategy in response
to water scarcity is for privileged individuals or firms to intensify
extraction of groundwater, harming access to water for nearby areas75
and increasing prices for water sold by the public utility76. These
risks make intensification of the damage function just as likely as or
more likely than adaptation to it (Fig. 2). That is, **[while it is
often argued that damage functions will shift over time as adaptations
come online, such shifts may be just as likely to occur in the opposite
direction. The accumulating risks of climate change may undermine the
precise adaptations that we appreciate at present]{.underline}** and
expose our economies to even greater climate risk than is currently
projected.

[**Climate change** is **one of** the most significant humanitarian,
environmental, social, economic and legal issues of our

undeniable[: climate change will have a catastrophic and devastating
impact on indigenous people.6 Whether it is the Indian tribes of the
Amazon rainforests,7 the indigenous people of the Torres Strait,8 **or
the Inuit people of the Arctic**]{.underline},9 indigenous people,
communities and nations around the globe will face the catastrophic and
devastating impact of climate change**. [Sadly many of humanity's oldest
people face]{.underline}** [the **loss of their traditional** homelands
and the extinction of their people as early as 2050.10 In light of this,
for over three decades, the international scientific community has
repeatedly warned governments, industry and the international community
that carbon pollution and climate change are anthropogenic and
industrial;]{.underline} that carbon pollution and [**climate change

indigenous people in particular**; **yet governments, industry and the
international community** have continually **failed to act** to prohibit
carbon pollution and climate change]{.underline}, in full knowledge and
disregard of the catastrophic impact of their behaviour.11 Given the
devastating impact of climate change on indigenous people and given the
failure of governments, industry and the international community to
prohibit carbon pollution, what legal rights exists for indigenous
people, communities and nations to seek redress for the wanton
destruction of their traditional homelands and the extinction of their
people[? Moreover, **given the dependence of** **indigenous people on
their traditional homelands for the survival of their physical,
spiritual and cultural existence**, **does** the wanton **destruction of
their traditional homelands constitute cultural genocide** or a **crime
against humanity** under international criminal law]{.underline}**?** It
is the contention of this paper that while it may be impossible to
establish under the strict tests of international criminal law; the
[wanton destruction of the traditional homelands of indigenous people
and the extinction of their people by climate change does constitute
cultural genocide and **amounts to one of the most serious crimes in our
human history**]{.underline}. As such, the impending extinction of
indigenous people and the destruction of their land represent one of the
greatest losses and tragedies to the human family

and translate that are [rarely]{.mark} [available]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
settings where **[dominant science]{.mark}** is the norm]{.underline}.
While tribal climate adaptation was a goal of the networks, there was
little agreement on how well large-scale networks were delivering such
material benefits to Native communities. The [initiatives
[fostered]{.mark} **[meaningful]{.mark}** [work]{.mark} as they sought
[to]{.mark} [remedy]{.mark} [socio-ecological]{.mark} [issues]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [develop]{.mark} structures for **[Indigenous
mentoring]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, [**resource challenges** were
pervasive]{.underline}. That is, [funding was
**inadequate**]{.underline}, and there was also a [lack of time and paid
staff. Burnout, resilience building, and social learning all
coexist]{.underline}.

Unsurprisingly, tensions arose around network participants' identities
and social locations (Byrd & Rothberg, 2011; Taylor, 2000). Significant
differences were noted at times between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
perspectives and some networks dealt with contentious relational
dynamics in direct ways. In particular, Native American women
experienced intersectional inequalities even in partnerships that aimed
to do otherwise (cf. Dhillon, 2020). Network members also regularly work
through layers of insider/outsider dynamics (Jacob, 2006; Smith,
1999/2012).

Distinct challenges emerged for the boundary organizations.

For one, there was a need to [consider [climate change]{.mark} as a
**[phenomenon]{.mark}** that is **[connected]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} many
[other]{.mark} [concerns]{.mark} that Native peoples grapple
with.]{.underline} Cross-cultural environmental partnerships are rarely
prepared for this. Consequently, [**[Indigenous governance]{.mark}**
[became]{.mark} a [crucial]{.mark} part of the
collaborations]{.underline}. The networks posed risks to Native Nations
because partners might exploit and coopt tribal knowledges or interfere
with political sovereignties and collective tribal priorities.
[[Indigenous]{.mark} [governance]{.mark} aims to **[expand]{.mark}
[opportunities]{.mark}** [for cultural practices]{.mark} that can be at
odds with dominant sciences]{.underline}. [Interactive Indigenous
councils were identified as [accountable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [Native
peoples' lives in ways]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [contrast]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} the consequences of [**settler states**]{.mark} and
societies]{.underline} (Hall & Fenelon, 2009; Whyte et al., 2018).

The technical-scientific aspects of [collaborations could not be
separated from their **political** implications]{.underline}.
[[Working]{.mark} largely [outside]{.mark}]{.underline} formal
governments [[enabled]{.mark} a set of potential [outcomes]{.mark}
through Indigenous-settler climate networks that are [less]{.mark}
[likely]{.mark} to occur [in **bureaucratic**]{.mark}
**[spaces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It was particularly [true for
**[bypassing]{.mark}** the U.S. [fed]{.mark}eral government
[that]{.mark} **systematically** [aims]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [Indigenous
dispossessions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hall & Fenelon, 2009; Whyte, 2016).
Dominant environmental management discourses were noted as discordant
with Indigenous relationships to places and other species.

This study has implications for how applied climate science fields
navigate racism and demands for social justice (Pearson & Schuldt, 2014;
Taylor, 2015). Some climate practitioners identified interpersonal
dynamics in the networks that resulted in cultural harm. These lived
experiences are reminders that the sciences play a role in formulating
and reproducing systems of oppression (Benjamin, 2016; Hatch, 2020;
TallBear, 2013). Attempts to address inequities should go beyond
increasing diversity or enacting liberal notions of inclusion that do
not resonate with Indigenous conceptions of decolonization (Byrd &
Rothberg, 2011; Tuck & Yang, 2012). Effective alternatives would
consider how scientific cultures become tied to institutional structures
and the political--economic considerations of knowledge production
(Benjamin, 2016; Hatch, 2020; Smith, 1999/2012). The responsibility of
scientific endeavors to fundamentally improve material conditions for
humans and ecologies was highly regarded by climate practitioners.

In climate issues, [[coalitions]{.mark} that [target]{.mark} **broad
[institutional]{.mark} [transformations]{.mark}** remain
crucial]{.underline}. [Climate change]{.underline} as a social problem
[is **multiscale**]{.underline}; it is [simultaneously local and
global]{.underline}. A focus primarily on individual behaviors or local
actions will fail to address systemic drivers. [Colonialism is a **core
reason** why Indigenous peoples are among the first and worst impacted.
These are not "**accidental convergences**" of Indigenous lifeways bound
to ecosystems, the results of industrialization, and longpast unequal
legacies]{.underline} (Whyte, 2016, p. 100). Many Indigenous networks
convene to challenge the trajectories of highly industrialized nations
and non-Indigenous societies (ATNI, 2020; Hall & Fenelon, 2009; LaDuke,
1999; Whyte, 2014). Large-scale climate science networks offer one
valued forum for Indigenous networks to collectively confront
climate-related issues in structural, sociocultural, and material forms.
Ultimately, the core challenges identified in this article are not novel
even as climate impacts accelerate.

[[Cross]{.mark}-[boundary]{.mark} [collaborations]{.mark}
are]{.underline} sometimes [[necessary]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
at times [[desirable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indigenous practitioners
[anticipate beneficial outcomes from collaborative efforts]{.underline}.
These ranged from [increased intergenerational mentoring to
[improved]{.mark} **[tribal]{.mark} climate [adaptation]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indigenous land relations and
restitution goals were voiced by some practitioners; these conflict with
normalized settler perspectives about nonIndigenous dominance of North
American landscapes (Tuck & Yang, 2012). Indigenous participants, in
particular, pointed toward TCUs, tribal environmental departments,
intertribal consortiums, and Indigenous-led social movements as
coalition partners that are also conducting related boundary work.
[Diverse formations of Indigenous environmental leadership already
[target]{.mark} key **[social]{.mark} [drivers]{.mark}** of climatic
changes [and]{.mark} [support]{.mark} meaningful **[restoration
efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline} (LaDuke, 1999; Middleton, 2011; Whyte,
2014; Wildcat 2009).

The decolonial environmental framework utilized in this article
[broadens sociological understandings of climate change and colonialism
as ongoing and connected social problems]{.underline}. This paper
grounds theory within lived experiences by examining how Indigenous and
non-Indigenous actors work to build climate networks. To develop
effective partnerships, [climate change boundary organizations must
attend to contentious **cross-cultural dynamics**, **structural
inequalities**, and material conditions; good communication, the
recognition of different ways of knowing, and the coproduction of
climate knowledges were deemed important, yet insufficient.]{.underline}

## Settler Colonialism

#### Settler colonialism has shifted its environmental management tactics away from [extraction and exploitation]{.underline} to [conservation]{.underline} as a means of revitalizing settler biopolitics. Conservation politics work by demarcating the environment as an ahistorical, depoliticized object in order to naturalize settler sovereignty over it. Moves towards indigenous inclusion into settler governance structures [exacerbate this further]{.underline} by utilizing indigenous relations to the environment as a means to consolidate a multicultural, liberal polity.

colonialism; [how does land become nation-state space]{.underline}?176
While distant from Indonesia, this inquiry is relevant as applied to
Hawai\`i.177 [How do Ka\`ena lands come to "belon\[g\]"178 to the State
of Hawai\`i]{.underline}?179 And, [how does this incorporation of
physical space also corral indigenous inhabitants into a political
system]{.underline} ("Go ask the President . . .")? 180 [By
foregrounding the state's interest in a land's resources, Tsing's quote
**underscores a crucial modality of settler state
authority**]{.underline} that Foucault terms, "biopower."181 [[Biopower
is not amassed as the]{.mark} holdings of a wealthy sovereign but from
the intrinsic wealth of the state's natural resources, commercial
possibilities, trade balances, and, most of all, "[the growth and
productivity of its population]{.mark}]{.underline}."182 State power is
thus power over life itself as opposed to gathering power, as surplus
labor, as the proceeds from existing lives. 183 [[States "assume
responsibility for life processes]{.underline}]{.mark}\[;\]" 184 thereby
[exercising biopower at a capillary level of controlling and modifying
populations, reproduction, nutrition, etc]{.underline}.185 HB645 (the
now-defunct legislative proposal to allow permit holders to fish
overnight) enunciates the state's biopolitical interests in Ka\`ena:186
Ka\`ena point . . . has long been a place where local residents can
exercise and enjoy their cultural practice of fishing. However,
tourists, who are unfamiliar with the area and not aware of the dangers
of the illegal activity occurring at Ka\`ena point, have experienced
being robbed, beaten, sexually assaulted, and pulled out of their
vehicles at all hours of the day and night. Due to this unpermitted
illegal activity at Ka\`ena point, the department of land and natural
resources has prohibited overnight camping to protect the natural
resources within the park and to promote safety for park users. This
prohibition, however, has impeded upon the local cultural practice of
fishing.187 As depicted in HB 645, [the state stumbled in its rush to
regulate "unpermitted illegal activity" and "protect the natural
resources]{.underline}\[,\]" thus [inadvertently **impeding a valued
"local cultural practice of fishing."**]{.underline}188 **[[Settler
state biopolitics transforms the lives of the public and non-human
species into rationales for state
intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}**.189 [What is
biopolitical]{.underline} about the state's interventions at Ka\`ena
[concerns the kinds of lives targeted for governmental
intervention]{.underline}--- [urban lives, houseless lives, and the
lives of tourists whose safety and enjoyment are economic baselines for
state parks]{.underline}.190 **[Environmental conservation here supports
state racism, a police-powered state warfare against particular
populations within a social body]{.underline}**. 191 The state's program
of sanitizing, by "externalizing," Ka\`ena's landscape of undesirable
elements in the name of a living social body is a racism that Foucault
recognized as singular to the biopolitical.192 Crucially, state racism
targets criminal and "tent-cit\[y\]" populations, not Hawaiians.193 In
this framing, the state evades addressing intersections between the
populations, which would involve the criminalization of Hawaiians
(evident in disproportionate rates of incarceration)194 and
dispossession of homelands, which has left a disproportionate number of
Hawaiians literally houseless.195 This evasion is biopolitical; it
produces a kind of Hawaiian life that can live under settler colonial
governance.196 C. GREENING BIOPOWER [State intervention into lives
associated with Ka\`ena did not begin with HB645. The 1974
conceptualization of Ka\`ena State Park to fulfill "city dweller"197
needs for aesthetic respite]{.underline}, for example, [marks state
intervention on behalf of a kind of person who **relates to "wilderness"
as a place of recreation**, "not a site for productive labor and not a
permanent home\[]{.underline}.\]"198 Historically, [preserving the value
of "virgin, 'uninhabited' wilderness" has meant the enforced exclusion
of Indians as original inhabitants from lands that thereby "lost its
savage image and became safe: a place more of reverie than of revulsion
or fear."]{.underline}199 [The state legislature's guise of making
Ka\`ena safer, particularly for tourists and city-dwellers, **maintains
this conception of wilderness-as-respite**.]{.underline}200 This
administration of life is not benign, 201 but suffuses conflicts between
"disparate interes\[t\]" groups at Ka\`ena.202 DLNR sees itself as torn
between its legal obligations to protect Hawaiian traditional
practices,203 and the resources that are necessary for those practices,
the general public's interest in these resources, and the imperative to
protect the resources themselves.204 [This framing of the problem---**as
one remediable by better-balancing "user conflicts" against finite
resources---inoculates the state's interests in Ka\`ena Point from
scrutiny**]{.underline}.205 [Specifying the ways settler colonialism
directs state interests in Ka\`ena allows us to better see these
conflicts as **enunciations of direct-action land struggles for Hawaiian
sovereignty**]{.underline}.206 [Political ecology207 and "green
governmentality"208 theories attend to "\[t\]he ways in which the
**environment is constructed as in crisis, how knowledge about it is
formed, and who then is authorized to save it\[**.\]"]{.underline}209
These theories build on Foucault's insights into the nature of modern
power to critique a "new regime of environmentality\[.\]"210 [The "art
of govern\[ing\]"]{.underline} 211 [populations by acting on a
discursive object called the "environment" is **a state project in which
scientists, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and community
organizations take part**.21]{.underline}2 That is, [state and non-state
actors **interact through a regularized way of talking, understanding,
and producing knowledge about the "environment" and its terms
management.2**]{.underline}13 In their CCH petitions against BLNR
approval of the predator-proof fence, 214 for instance, [petitioners
invoked these terms to challenge KPERP assertions about best practices
for protecting native species and complying with historic preservation
laws]{.underline}. 215 [Theirs was a tactical engagement with green
governmentality to achieve legal intelligibility]{.underline}.216
[Attending to these tactics exhorts us to ask:]{.underline} **[what
non-"environmentalist" propositions about relating to Ka\`ena's lands,
species, and histories are excluded by narrowing the field of debate
over the fence to issues such as noncompliance with a recommendation to
complete an AIS?]{.underline}**217 [How,]{.underline} for instance, are
[knowledge of cultural reciprocity with Ka\`ena lands not addressed by
environmental discourses?2]{.underline}18 In this view, "[process" is
**not only a checklist of reviews and consultations**, but of
re-building relationships and especially with those who carry memories
of disenfranchisement on Ka\`ena lands]{.underline}.219 **[Even state
actions directed towards accommodating Hawaiian understandings of
Ka\`ena220 are consistent with biopolitical management of
populations]{.underline}**.221 [DLNR]{.underline}, for instance,
[constructed a third gate that opens directly onto the Leina a ka
\`uhane to address Hawaiian cultural practitioners' concerns that the
fence would prevent souls from accessing the Leina]{.underline}.222 Some
"stakeholders" felt the gate unnecessary because spirits can pass
through physical structures, some approved the gate, and others---not
mentioned in KPERP---countered that they had no way of knowing whether
spirits could unlock gates. 223 We notice KPERP's narrow phrasing of the
issue; 224 it notes the presence of multiple interpretations of Hawaiian
spiritualities, without addressing those that interpret the fence as
incompatible with Ka\`ena's sacred landscape.225 The document does not
identify the epistemic conundrum that follows from attempting to
"assess" spiritual knowledges for decision making purposes. 226 [By so
**restricting the implications of Hawaiians' multiple interpretations of
culture, practical resolutions such as the spirit gate are made to
seem227 appropriate redress.**]{.underline}228 D. (SETTLER) COLONIAL
BIOPOLITICS Other scholars have noted Foucault's relative silence on the
historical relationship between modern power and colonialism and sought
to extend his analyses of biopower to settler colonial regimes.229 In
The Biopolitics of Settler Colonialism: Right Here, Right Now, Scott L.
[Morgensen demonstrates that sixteenth-century settler colonialism
conditions the eighteenth and nineteenth century-era situations that
Foucault linked to the rise of the modern biopolitical
state.2]{.underline}30 Whereas scholarly attention to biopolitical
racism emphasized colonial processes of sanitizing and excluding
colonial "others" from the European social body, Morgensen notes that
**[[the biopolitics of settler colonialism demands techniques of]{.mark}
"occupying and [incorporating indigenous peoples within white settler
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**."231 [Settler colonial biopolitics not
only eradicates and excludes, but "makes live" indigenous
subjects]{.underline}.232 On one level, [settler states make indigenous
lives through official procedures for recognition, nationality, and even
sovereignty]{.underline}.233 [[State administration of indigenous
lives]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[takes [less blunt forms, such as
prescriptions for recognizing traditional and customary
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**, 234 **[claiming an interest in the
buried \`iwi (bones) of indigenous ancestors,235 and compiling rolls for
a Native Hawaiian self-governing entity]{.underline}**.236 [Asserting
that the settler state makes indigenous lives further emphasizes settler
societies' "inherent interdependence with indigeneity]{.underline}."237
**[Approaching settler colonial power as an assemblage in which the
state relies 238 on the indigenous, as opposed to merely tolerating239
them, renders state policies of accommodating Hawaiian culture
unsurprising]{.underline}**.240 Part III discusses the ways the settler
state is itself produced through "\[a\]djudicating life for indigenous
people."241 III. GOVERNANCE OF THE PRIOR: AN APPLIED ANALYTICAL
FRAMEWORK "I believe that we will find that the 'fence' \[at Ka\`ena\]
has less to do with protecting birds than with establishing control over
the land. Controlling who and what is provided right of way." - Paul
Kealoha-Blake, Ka\`ena Cultural Practice Project.242 "Governance of the
prior" holds that what matters politically is who arrived first.243 It
is a political formation, based in fundamental tensions between settler
states' and indigenous peoples' claims to sovereignty.244 The problem
with a discourse of priority is that it invidiously equates indigenous
peoples' prior occupancy with a rational self-interest in a
property-regime.245 Presuming an indigenous interest in their traditions
and histories as property allows the settler state to inhabit a position
of liberated rationality in contrast with indigenous political
perspectives that adhere to their partial, because propertied, vantage
on society.246 Embedded in this formation of power, indigenous peoples
and the settler state "do not confront each other," but rather "share a
vital set of organs."247 They are needed to signal the political
priority of the creole settler state and to embody a kind of national
difference that, because genealogically-linked,248 contrasts with a
"universal" liberal polity.249 Crucially, these shared ideological
"organs" mean indigenous peoples are not only another sovereign in
competition with the settler state, but are also necessary to the
production of the state itself.250 Competing claims of firstness without
specific cultural groundings may merely repeat the logic of governance
by priorness. Historically, "the governance of the prior" proceeds from
the emergence of a modern form of governance distinguished from kingly
sovereign rule,251 British colonial and imperial administration, and the
U.S. colonies' development of a distinctive "creole nationalism"252 in
the course of claiming political independence from Britain. 253 The
notion of the political priority of the prior person in right as a rule
of governance in British colonies.254 The U.S. retained the concept of
prior-ness in formulating a "creole nationalism" against an imperial
metropole (Britain) and in so doing, projected indigenous peoples as the
horizon of the U.S. settler state's legitimacy.255 Although Hawaiians
often define themselves as a genealogicallylinked political body, 256
the settler state achieves its own aims by defining itself in contrast
to Hawaiians.257 Critical scholars contend that the "consanguinal logic"
of indigenous identity has been instrumental towards "amalgamat\[ing\]
and eliminat\[ing\] Indigenous peoples . . . \[to\] thereby enable
settler states to performatively universalise the West."258 A [liberal,
multicultural, and universal U.S. sovereign can absorb indigenous
subjects, 259 whereas indigenous political collectives are presumed
constrained by illiberal tradition and genealogy]{.underline}. 260 Put
otherwise, [settler colonialism lies with a liberal multicultural
political discourse that distributes the terms of belonging and
obligation within narratives of freedom (liberalism) and constraint
(genealogy]{.underline}). 261 Povinelli proffers escaping the politics
of the governance of the prior by "making a new spacing" in which this
crisis of obligation and belonging may be foregrounded. 262 This paper
suggests lawai\`a stewardship proposals create such a new space of
governance.263 A. LEGAL MANEUVERS AND LIBERAL MULTICULTURALISM [We are
tracking "strategic manoeuvers]{.underline}" 264 [through which the
liberal state **subordinates, by affirming, Hawaiian priority in
Hawai\`**]{.underline}i.265 [One move is to **limit Hawaiian claims to
distinctiveness to liberal predicates of political
legibility**]{.underline}.266 Respectfully conducted, historically
established, and not repugnant,267 [Hawaiian traditional and customary
practices are cabined within legal parameters that ensure that they will
not unreasonably interfere with settler society]{.underline}.268 On the
other side of this move, [[the settler state **achieves an identity with
a "truer, deeper multiculturalism" through its formal legal recognition
of** ]{.mark}**Hawaiian distinctive histories, laws, and [traditional
cultures]{.mark}**]{.underline}.269 Povinelli's research in Australia
sheds light on certain limitations of Hawai\`i's jurisprudence.270
Australian courts have recognized a kind of equivalence between the
Australian and British "worlds" from which aboriginal Native title and
Australian common law proceed, respectively.271 This equivalence is not
equal, however, because, as Australian Justice Kirby writes, "self
evidently . . . the High Court is not an institution of customary
law."272 [[These]{.mark} restricted [overtures towards aboriginal
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Povinelli, [merely [**impose
a "reassuring form of liberal capitalist democracy" that perpetuates the
life of a supposedly more multicultural settler
nation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}[27]{.mark}3 [This multiculturalist
paradigm is reassuring to a settler society that seeks the survival of a
"subtending liberal formation"]{.underline} (capitalist democracy) [more
so than to realize "the actual content of traditional law (or native
title)."]{.underline}274 [[This is]{.underline} **[the state's "cunning
of recognition]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[."]{.underline}**275 The State
of Hawai\`i also recognizes its continuities with Hawaiian Kingdom law
in state statutes,276 the state constitution,277 and Hawai\`i's common
law.278 As in Australia, the common law of England and of Hawaiian
Kingdom customary law are unequal and articulated.279 The rights and
duties owed to Hawaiians, consequent to these legal authorities, have
had material and beneficial impacts on Hawai\`i's communities,
ecologies, and political structure.280 [[This
paper]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[views]{.mark} the [state's
recognition]{.mark} of Hawaiian rights [as a **strategy for holding
together a U.S. polity**]{.mark}**--the people of Hawai\`i--[over
foundational settler colonial contradictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.281
Hawai\`i's Supreme Court and legislature have affirmed the interests of
"the people of Hawai\`i" in a horizon of "lasting reconciliation" with
Hawaiians.282 This affirmation rightly registers an ongoing "ethical or
political bind inherent in \[the people of Hawai\`i's\] being and
relation."283 [Hawai\`i's "multiculturalist faith in time" is that a
juridical framework in which Hawaiians hold a protected legal status
will eventually lead to reconciliation of ongoing colonial
injustices]{.underline}.284 This "interval" between a colonized present
and a horizon of justice, Povinelli argues, provides a temporal "tense"
of social belonging that emerges out of the specific historical
formation of the governance of the prior.285 B. LIBERAL TOLERANCE AND
CAMPING PERMITS AT KA\`ENA [[The "people of Hawai\`i" is cohered]{.mark}
as settler polity [by **assigning value to indigenous difference within
a liberal multiculturalism that neutralizes indigenous priority as a
political claim**]{.mark}**.**286]{.underline} [Liberal [settler
multiculturalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, [[offers itself as a
solution to the problem of **how all can fit within a settler society
while foreclosing interrogation of settler colonial
foundations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 287 [Liberal theory]{.underline}
thus [serves as a mechanism **through which modern liberal settler
states define themselves in and through their "tolerance" of indigenous
peoples**]{.underline}. 288 [This performed-universality sustains
liberal settler states' capacity to incorporate and occupy difference,
including the ideally incorporated difference of native
peoples]{.underline}.289 [DLNR's approach to Ka\`ena's]{.underline}
"user conflicts" [is a cluster of "**strategic manoeuvres"290 through
which the State of Hawai\`i asserts itself as a benign, even
enlightened, authority over Hawai\`i's public trust
resources**]{.underline}.291 [Public trust rationales undergird DLNR's
anxieties]{.underline} about homeless tent-cities, [and are **linked to
biopolitical concerns for public safety, maintaining natural resources
for tourist-ready use, and endangered species
conservation**.2]{.underline}92 Against lawai\`a who argued that the
"camping paraphernalia" regulation293 should make allowances for
overnight fishing at Ka\`ena, former-DLNR chair Thielen cited the
states' interests in liberal equality:294 The problem is the law does
not allow the state to discriminate between different people. We can't
allow tents only for fishers--- we have to allow them for anyone. If we
allow an unlimited number of tents, like we've seen elsewhere in Hawai­i,
parks quickly become tent cities that crowd out the general public,
including fishers. In order to manage parks so they remain safe and open
to the public, we either have to prohibit tents overnight or only allow
a specific number of tents at a given time without discriminating
between applicants.295
