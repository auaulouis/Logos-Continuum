# Notes 

This file primarily critiques the framing of climate change as an
existential threat in ways that often undermine the development of vital
adaptation strategies for communities living in vulnerable regions. One
of the most climate-vulnerable areas in the world is the Arctic. Yet,
many proposed solutions rooted in a reduction-based framework fail to
address the urgent needs of Indigenous peoples currently facing the
impacts of melting ice and rapidly rising global temperatures. The
affirmative is constructed to remain topical while also critically
examining how our descriptions of the world shape our understanding of
it---and, in turn, influence the solutions we prioritize.

Please note that many responses to 2AC critiques or disadvantages (Ks or
DAs) can already be found in the affirmative answers to the Security
Kritik files circulated by others at camp. I saw no need to duplicate

For those looking back in time, schooners are symbols of Western Arctic
Expeditions. They reflect the interventions of whalers, scientists, and
governments, as well as the ways western Arctic Inuit responded to them
(figure 7). Schooners extended the range over which Inuit trappers could
find and sell furs in the 1920s, a decided advantage in trade. In 1917,
no Inuit trapper owned such a vessel. By 1926, there were fourteen Inuit
with them in the Mackenzie Delta area. None of these were crafted
locally; all came from departing whalers and scientists. By 1935, more
than fifty Inuit owned schooners­ evidence of how important the
technology became to Inuit livelihood. [In these ways, [Inuit]{.mark}
who accompanied fieldworkers and received discarded gear became leaders
of northern communities and economies in a subsequent generation. They
[translated knowledge]{.mark} and technology [into sources of
subsistence and identity, in the midst of rapid environmental
change.]{.mark} In this case, [the resilience of Inuit]{.mark} is [as
remarkable as]{.mark} the scientific project of trying to control the
Arctic. Indeed, the two forces produced each other.45 [In conceiving of
the Arctic as threatened, scientists and governmental officials **gave
themselves power over northern life**, even if they could not fathom
Inuit reshaping the land on their own.]{.mark}]{.underline} Scientists,
bureaucrats, and Native northerners would not fully realize this
situation ­ and the disruptions it could create­ until they met again in
the Arctic. When botanist Alf Erling Porsild went to northern Alaska and
the Mackenzie Delta at the end of the 1920s, he brought only four books
with him. One was Stefansson's report of his 1908--­ 12 expedition, My
Life with the Eskimo, and the other a copy of Leffingwell's The Canning
River Region. Yet neither account matched the landscape in front of him
or the movements of Inuit on schooners across the western Arctic. [The
frontiers and debates that [science]{.mark} had supposedly settled
seemed re[open]{.mark}ed, even wilder than before. This was evidence to
sup- port a [new colonial imperative]{.mark} after the Great War[: tame
the tundra]{.mark}.46]{.underline}

[Chapter 3]{.underline}

[Wild: Taming the Tundra]{.underline}

One was a Danish botanist raised in Greenland. The other was an American
plant ecologist trained on the sheep lands of Utah. Alf Erling Porsild
and Lawrence Palmer shared a purpose: transform the Arctic into reindeer
country.1 They met at the depot in Anchorage in July, 1926. The Canadian
Department of the Interior sent Porsild to learn about Palmer's work
with the US Bureau of Biological Survey. Palmer had spent the previous
seven years studying Alaska's vegetation and teaming with the Lomen
Company of Nome to build a new industry in the territory. Reindeer, a
species foreign to North America, but common in other parts of the
circumpolar world, formed the center of this business. The biologists
headed for Fairbanks so that the Canadian representative could see the
foundation of the reindeer system. As they toured Palmer's field station
and experimental farm, Palmer showed off his plant trials. Here, in
fenced­ off patches of lichens, sat the makings of another round of
intervention in Arctic life. In the period between the world wars,
Palmer and Porsild generated new knowledge of plants, animals, and their
relationships, and applied that knowledge in governmental and corporate­
sponsored reindeer projects throughout the western Arctic. After his
rendezvous with Palmer in Fairbanks, Porsild traveled north along the
Beaufort Sea shoreline into Canada, where he surveyed thousands of
square miles of tundra to find a suitable home for a Canadian herd. His
official report of these travels, Reindeer Grazing in Northwest Canada,
provided the basis for the Canadian government's choice of the Mackenzie
Delta as a home for its Canadian Reindeer Project, the Dominion's
attempt to replicate the US Bureau of Biology's success. In 1929,
Porsild returned to Alaska to meet Palmer again, this time to purchase
three thousand reindeer from the Lomen Company and drive them to the
delta. When the Danish botanist celebrated that "grand sight" in his
field journal, he commemorated a historic moment. Reindeer ushered in a
new era in the north.2 Ecologists effectively introduced reindeer and
initiated systematic study and management of herding. Keeping these
colonial projects viable over time proved to be a whole other animal,
however. While six teams of Inuit became managers of herds in Canada
after 1938, all of these operations collapsed by 1959. In that year, the
Canadian government handed the project to private developers, having
little to show for its million­ dollar investment. Meanwhile, along the
north slope of Alaska, reindeer herding followed a similar trajectory.
The number of reindeer in Barrow---­ the largest town in the region, with
a population over 1,200 Inuit---­ had dropped from an estimated 35,000 in
1935 to fewer than 5,000 by 1940. By 1952, domestic reindeer had
disappeared from the entire Arctic slope of Alaska.3 On the surface,
this turn of events seems easily disregarded as a harebrained colonial
scheme. Such a dismissal, however, overlooks the nature of intervention
in the Arctic, whether in the past or present. [[Federal agents
**rationalize their interference in northern life** according to]{.mark}
the [scientific ideas]{.mark} available to them. Between the world wars,
those ideas created a logic in which the reindeer could be a technology
of administration and development. [Rather than]{.mark} observe
[meteorological phenomena]{.mark} so whalers could secure their
harvests, or bring samples of minerals, flora, and fauna back to
museums, Porsild and Palmer reduced the Arctic to a few interactions
between people and the environment and tinkered with these interactions,
on site.]{.underline} Reindeer projects, then, were experimentalist in
the sense of the scientific method as well as experiments for
governmental scientists who had never before managed Arctic resources
directly. Scientists explained that the tundra was wild. The rational
approach­ the natural thing to do­ was to was tame it.

The Limits of the Capitalist Imagination In James Tynion IV's and Martin
Symmonds' graphic novel series Depart- ment of Truth (2020, Vol. 1), FBI
agent Cole Turner spends his time analysing far-right conspiracy
movements, from people who believe that the Earth is flat, to those who
subscribe to the theory that the US govern- ment has been taken over by
shapeshifting reptilians. While attending a Flat Earth convention, Cole
is invited by the organizers to attend a cinema screening of the 1969
moon landing that conclusively shows that it was recorded at a film
studio by Stanley Kubrick. Cole is then flown in a private airplane to
the very end of the Earth where an enormous wall of ice rises up until
it meets the sky. [[The Earth is flat]{.mark}.]{.underline} Turner
throws up in the aeroplane toilet[. [But the Earth is not, in fact,
**flat**]{.underline}]{.mark}. What Cole has seen, both in the cinema
and at the end of the plane ride, are versions of the world gener- ated
by the concerted faith of a particular conspiracy movement. The universe
within which the story takes place is pliable to such belief. Conspiracy
theory is thus capable of warping the actual fabric of reality. After
his traumatic visit to the end of the world, Cole is picked up and
recruited by the undercover Department of Truth. The director of this
department explains that '[the more people believe in something, the
more true that thing becomes' (2020, no 1. p. 37). This allows the major
**capitalist** actors to actively manipulate the fundamental
**constitution** of the world through the **invention** and
**dissemination** of outlandish **conspiracy theories** that stimulate
these actors' **political** and **economic** agenda]{.underline}. The
flat Earth convention and the trip to the end of the Earth have been
orga- nized and sponsored by 'Kennet and Bertram Boulet'1 who have used
'the fortune from their Texas oil company' to fund 'right-wing
politicians for the last two decades' (2020, no 1, p. 24). Cole is also
told that the conspiracies these and other people like them fund are
tied to periodic crises. They are 'a cyclical thing. It happens in times
of primal cultural fear' (2020, no 2, p. 27). By promoting the idea that
[the]{.underline} [capitalist world-ecology is the only possible world
and that futures that do not include capitalism are already and always
dystopian, [the American **Climate Emergency Narrative**]{.mark}
performs work disturbingly similar to that done by conspiracy theories
in]{.underline} The Department of Truth. These fictions are telling
people the world- altering lie that biospheric breakdown is best
resolved by investing in the system and strategies that, in fact, have
brought the crisis on. Again, this [body of texts [calls]{.mark}
socio-[ecological breakdown an **emergency**]{.mark}, but [only to
facilitate]{.mark} the [employment of the]{.mark} [**strategies** that
have always been used to **secure extraction**]{.mark}: the **arming**
and [**employment** of **military**]{.mark} and paramili- tary units,
the [**building** of **borders**]{.mark}, the [creation of surveillance
systems]{.mark}, and the [**dismantling** of **labour** and
**extraction** laws]{.mark}. Even in the case when these narratives
attempt to critique the insidious, **violent**, and **profoundly**
[entangled **racist**, **sexist**, and **cisheteronormative** paradigms
that]{.mark} have [aid]{.mark}ed **[extractive capitalism]{.mark}**,
they fail to offer worlds beyond the **horizon** imagined by
**capitalism**.]{.underline} The Earth, at the end of the extractive
journey, is flat. Capitalism is a great wall of impenetrable ice
stretching up into the oblivion of a starry night sky. You cannot move
beyond it because there is nothing on the other side. To expand on this
argument, and to summarize the most important points of this book, I
have argued that much of what is called climate fiction, defined as a
new literary genre profoundly informed by climate science and engaged in
an attempt to provide readers with roadmaps towards sustainable futures,
is so preoccupied with notions of climate 1 This is a reference to
Charles and David Koch, sponsors of a number of anti-science, alt-right
groups, including the Flat Earth movement (see McIntyre 2021, 87--88).8
FALLOUT FUTURES 183 emergency and the inevitability of capitalism that a
better denominator for many of them is Climate Emergency Narrative.
Thus, [these texts cast climate **breakdown**, rather than the
**processes** and **systems** that have produced it, as the problem.
Consequently, the **American military security apparatus** that has been
central to the effort of transforming much of the planet into a resource
for **extractive capitalism** is leveraged as the only system capable of
**managing** this **emergency**]{.underline}. In the texts studied,
[socio-ecological breakdown is thus rhetorically resolved through inter-
**state military conflict**, through the violent managing of climate
refugees, and by combating the planet **itself**.]{.underline} The book
has furthermore shown how [the American Climate Emer- gency Narrative
builds on a long tradition of writing that can be traced, like
**biospheric breakdown** itself, back to the **early colonial
period**]{.underline}. In this way, the American Climate Emergency
Narrative emerges out of the same historical and literary tradition, and
the same cyclical crises, that have produced the now hegemonic core of
the capitalist world- system, or, as Moore terms it, the capitalist
world-ecology. [In this way, the American Climate Emergency Narrative
describes **biospheric** break- down from the **particular perspective**
that the **hegemonic** core **constitutes**.]{.underline} Again, the
world-literature perspective that I have employed---intro- duced by
Franco Moretti (1996) and reworked by the Warwick Research Collective
(2015)---[poses that [the experience of the **world-system** is]{.mark}
combined and **[uneven]{.mark}**: all people across the planet is
**currently** **experiencing** the same planetary-scale
**ecological/socioeconomic** crisis---the crisis is combined---but they
do so in very different ways---the **crisis is uneven**.]{.underline}
While precarious communities in the peripheries and semiperipheries of
the world-system have long been experiencing the violence used to
enclose and extract land, the ecological depletion such extractive
violence causes, and the deregulatory strategies employed to keep nature
and labour cheap are [only now beginning to affect life in the core of
the world-system. This is why [this crisis appears as new]{.mark} or as
a future emer- gency [in]{.mark} many parts of [the **Global
North**]{.mark}. Thus, it is [not]{.mark} strange that [a
socio-ecological crisis that has been **unfolding** for **400
years**]{.mark} is described as new and forthcoming also in narratives
from the core]{.underline}. As noted by Kyle P. Whyte (2018) in the
article 'Indigenous Science (Fiction) for the Anthropocene: Ancestral
Dystopias and Fantasies of Climate Change Crises', [[there is a]{.mark}
prevalent [tendency in **settler writing** to locate]{.mark} [**climate
apocalypse** in rapidly]{.mark} approaching **futures** [rather than in
the **long history**]{.mark}]{.underline}184 J. HÖGLUND that paved the
way for the capitalist world-ecology. Similarly, because the US
hegemonic core has for such a long invested in, and been privileged by,
this world-ecology, it appears, from the perspective of this core, as
inevitable and singular: as the thing that saves and the thing that
needs saving. As I have discussed in several of the chapters of the
book, many of the texts that I have classified as American Climate
Emergency Narratives have been funded and produced by the network of
actors tasked with main- taining the core: the US military, the
military-industrial complex and the merger between these entities and
the entertainment industry that has been termed the Military
Entertainment Complex. This is an informal gathering of capitalist
institutions and interests tasked with keeping the American nation-state
secure and operational. It is not strange that films and other
entertainment media generated by this network should struggle to break
the bounds of the capitalist imagination. Indeed, they are tasked with
policing imagination as such. As the book has illustrated, writing from
the core not formally supported by the Military Entertainment Complex
also tends to toe the line. Even the most dystopian writing from the
core, the texts that register the arrival of a socio-ecological break-
down of such proportions that it may be epochal or terminal, struggles
to imagine alternatives to capitalism. [[The]{.mark} [solution, in
the]{.mark} American [Climate]{.mark} [**Emergency Narrative**, is
always **adaptation**]{.mark} and **system restoration**, [not **system
change**. If this fails, darkness falls. **The Earth is
flat**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### This causes [parasitic fear]{.underline} causing colonial extractivism with the claim that it will be solved in the future forever, pushing natives out and reproducing colonial violence.

Emergency in Settler Capitalist Writing and the Plantation Text The
texts discussed in this chapter emerge out of different stages of the
economic and social history of America, yet they speak in strangely
similar ways about capitalism, ecology, security, and violence.
Underhill's Newes from America registers settler capitalism via the
violence performed on Indigenous people and the land they inhabit and
cultivate, but it simultaneously claims that this violence is both
justified and necessary. Thus, Newes from [[America **insists**
that]{.mark} the [emergency is located not in the **killing**]{.mark}
[of **Indigenous people**]{.mark} or the **destruction** of the land
they inhabit, [but in the possibility that]{.mark} these **people** and
[the land they live by may prevent **extraction**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
To symbolically 'spoil' and ruin the land is thus to make it secure for
extraction. [In this way, the text registers the **[ecological]{.mark}**
and human [destruction that **settler capitalism** produces]{.mark} but
**envisions** this as a **[necessary]{.mark}** response [to the
emergency that **Indigenous people**]{.mark} and land [create for
the]{.mark} early [**settler capitalist**
enterprise.]{.mark}]{.underline} The plantation text written by white
authors from different sections of the privileged semiperiphery also
registers the ecological and human 9 This is not to say that no such
alternatives were imagined. An odd example is George Fitzhugh's
profoundly racist and fiercely pro-slavery treaty Cannibals All!, or
Slaves Without Masters (1857). This text is fundamentally critical of
the impact that wage labour and liberal capitalism has had on American
people and society, and proposes slavery as a utopian, colour-blind,
socialist, Southern alternative.2 SETTLER CAPITALIST FRONTIERS 47
violence that the plantation produces. In this way, the plantation text
contributes both to the bourgeoning sense that extractive capitalism is
endemically troubled by an emergency of its own making, and to the
assumption that the solution to this emergency is the establishment of
the security regime that a permanent state of exception enables. If
extractive capitalism has engendered ecological and social erosion, the
solution is not, in the pro-slavery text, the dismantling of the system
as such, but the production of regimes capable of containing the
constant eruption of crises. [[When]{.mark} this [crisis is
**ecological**, the **solution** is to]{.mark} move the location of the
frontier; to find [**new land to extract**. When the crisis is
human]{.mark} and social, [the **solution** is to]{.mark} build more
effective systems to contain or [**eliminate** rebellious
**elements**]{.mark}. What must be secured is capitalism understood as
the right to property, the enclosure, and the **extractive processes**
that occur there.]{.underline} **[[Even]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
anti-slavery [**[texts that circulate an awareness of]{.mark}** the
social and **[ecological destruction produced by the
plantation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and that gesture, like Dred does, to
other types of sociality, [**[fall short of promoting]{.mark}
[alternative relationships]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} ([white]{.mark})
American **[society and the planet.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In this way,
both the pro-slavery and the abolitionist narratives promote an
expansive capitalism as the only viable way forward for the burgeoning
US nation-state. Thus, they fertilize the emergence of what Vandana
Shiva (1993) has termed 'monocultures of the mind' (p. 5). As Shiva
observes, such intellectual monocultures aid in the production of what
Mark Fisher calls 'capitalist realism'. As described in the
introduction, this realism generates a storyworld in which there is no
alternative to capitalism even when this system is perceived to cause
tremendous ruin and suffering. I will return to this concept in future
chapters. It should also be noted that the settler capitalist text and
the plantation novel both register crises of sorts. Returning to Patel
and Moore's observation that capitalism 'not only has frontiers; it
exists only through frontiers, expanding from one place to the next'
(19, italics in the original), it can be argued that capitalist crises
typically occur in between the closing of one frontier and the opening
of another. To simplify this process, the collapse of a particular
frontier causes a dearth in the flow of resources from the frontier,
while at the same time producing unemployment and a shortage of capital
both among wage labourers and those accumulating the fruits of labour.
This makes it necessary for capitalism to move on to new frontiers, to
leave exhausted land behind and to find new fertile soil (Cheap Nature)
where important cash crops can again be cultivated, or to find ways of
reinventing a depleted frontier so that it can yield48 J. HÖGLUND a new
kind of commodity. Settler capitalist writing and the Plantation text
both narrate this precise movement: how extractive capitalism must
constantly move on to new frontiers as a response to the crisis caused
by the exhaustion of the land. [As I will argue in what follows, the
**American** [Climate Emergency **Narrative** is locked into the **same
logic**]{.mark}, but comes out of a **moment** in time when the
**opportunity** to relocate the **frontier** [to keep **sourcing**
**nature cheaply is limited**.]{.mark} Thus, this new **narrative** form
gives voice and shape not **simply** to the imperative to **extract**
and **accumulate**, but to the **paralysing** prospect that such
**accumulation** may not be **possible** in the **near
future.**]{.underline}

#### Climate Change is irreversible, and scientist are afraid to report it.

This book differs significantly from most of the existing literature on
global warming and climate change. [It is [common to read]{.mark} in
most newspaper or magazine articles, popular science books, and even in
many scientific publications on climate change [that]{.mark} [although
global warming]{.mark} is [caused by]{.mark} human activities, [humans
still have the power to stop]{.mark} it from getting worse. The
[authors]{.mark} usually [repeat]{.mark} the same climate policy
mantra---that [time is running out]{.mark}, but we can still stop
[global warming]{.mark} if we act now.]{.underline} This misleading idea
is endlessly repeated and passed on from one book or article to the
next. In contrast to the literature, which talks about things that may
be good for the climate but are unattainable in practice, this book
describes the [**[reality]{.mark} and [presents evidence]{.mark}** that
clearly **[shows]{.mark} that [humanity will not be able to stop global
warming and climate change]{.mark} in the foreseeable
future**]{.underline}**.** [The reasons for this do not lie just in
ever-growing human economic activity, which is steadily increasing
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. There is an even bigger,
far worse problem. **Anthropogenic [global warming]{.mark} has
[awakened]{.mark} the [so called "sleeping
giants]{.mark}"---[dangerous]{.mark} powerful [natural processes]{.mark}
of [positive climate feedbacks]{.mark}---which [have already quickly
begun]{.mark} [to increase this warming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Positive
climate feedback is a process in which some initial change in climate
induces a secondary change, which in turn greatly increases the initial
change[. For example, **global warming (initial climate change) causes
permafrost to thaw (secondary change) and releases greenhouse gases from
decaying organic matter in thawing permafrost, which in turn further
increases global warming (increase in the initial climate change).**
Before the Industrial Revolution, these positive climate feedbacks were
dormant because the Earth was in a state of natural radiative
equilibrium where incoming energy from the sun was balanced by outgoing
energy from the Earth.]{.underline} Now, with Earth's ever-increasing
energy imbalance, [these **[natural "giants" have been awakened]{.mark},
and the big [problem is that once awakened, they will not go back to
sleep]{.mark}**[, **even if humanity stops emitting greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is because global
warming and positive climate feedbacks intensify each other in a
self-amplifying loop: rising temperatures reinforce climate feedbacks,
while stronger climate feedbacks accelerate the warming even more. The
activation of powerful positive, self-reinforcing climate feedbacks
completely changes our understanding of what will happen to the climate
in the future, because it means that further global warming will no
longer depend only on further anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
gases, as in the past, but also on climate feedbacks. [These positive
climate feedbacks are like a very dangerous genie that has already
popped out of the bottle and now cannot be put back. **[Even
if]{.mark},** sooner or later, **[humanity begins to reduce global
greenhouse gas emissions]{.mark}** (even if significantly), the
**[self-reinforcing climate feedbacks already initiated will still lead
to further global warming.]{.mark}**]{.underline} It is therefore
important to recognize that reducing emissions can slow global warming,
but not stop it. [**[With or without further anthropogenic
emissions]{.mark}**, the **self-reinforcing [climate feedbacks will
continue to cause significant warming]{.mark}** and will lead our planet
to much hotter conditions as early as the twenty-first century**,
[probably well above the \~3 °C]{.mark} global warming assumed under
current global climate policy**.]{.underline} In fact, global warming
could exceed pre-industrial levels by as much as 4--5 °C by the end of
the twenty-first century. A detailed explanation of what these positive
climate feedbacks are, how they work, and what additional warming they
may cause forms a large and important part of this book[. Such
information is almost entirely absent in much of the existing literature
on climate change, which tends to concentrate mainly on anthropogenic
emissions of greenhouse gases. With further climate warming imminent,
what should humanity do? This book shows **that [humanity has no choice
but to prepare for the worst-case scenario of a climate crisis and to
adapt to a new, much less comfortable climate.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Even if it isnt, adaptation is key.

But, as I noted, we've already surpassed seven of [nine planetary
boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html)
that define the constraints under which human and other life exists.
These relate to climate change, novel entities, stratospheric ozone
depletion (the only one somewhat resolved, thanks to an international
agreement), atmospheric aerosol loading (the only other boundary yet to
be transgressed), ocean acidification, modification of biogeochemical
flows, freshwater change, land system change and biosphere integrity. As
I told iPolitics, "If we pass one boundary, we should be shitting our
pants. We've passed seven!" We've known about the causes, consequences
and solutions to global heating for decades, if not centuries. We know
keeping the planet from heating to catastrophic levels means rapidly
shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy, among other measures.

It's still possible to move off this destructive path, but not if we

#### Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is key for indigenous adaptation to climate change in the arctic.

of the Global North to Help Mitigate Climate Change.\")kk

This indigenous knowledge is formally known as traditional ecological
knowledge (TEK). It is "a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and
belief, evolving by adaptive processes and handed down through
generations by cultural transmission, about the relationship of living
beings (including humans) with one another and with their
environment".[14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTM2_bT65VZoNmeamG2pI1JV3egzTqs7n-znKr2xf-I/edit#bookmark=id.e75ljpyukifl)
[[TEK]{.mark} is [essential to]{.mark} the [survival of indigenous
communities]{.mark}, and is [instrumental towards research]{.mark} for
[inclusive climate change adaptation
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.**

TEK is gradually gathered over generations by communities whose survival
is dependent on this information and is passed down to future
generations orally or through shared
traditions.[15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTM2_bT65VZoNmeamG2pI1JV3egzTqs7n-znKr2xf-I/edit#bookmark=id.jqs4uzw4yg5n)
[TEK can be used to develop adaptation strategies for environmental
changes [and]{.mark} can [interact and collaborate]{.mark} with
[scientific research]{.mark} as a "[local-scale expertise]{.mark}, [as a
source of climate history]{.mark} and baseline data, in formulating
research questions and hypotheses, as [insight into impacts]{.mark} and
[adaptation in communities]{.mark}, \[and\] for [long-term
community-based
monitoring]{.mark}".[16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTM2_bT65VZoNmeamG2pI1JV3egzTqs7n-znKr2xf-I/edit#bookmark=id.5tbirnj52qwd)
[Indigenous communities]{.mark} [in the global north]{.mark} have
[already]{.mark} been [utiliz]{.mark}ing [TEK to formulate their
adaptation strategies to]{.mark} the impacts of [climate change]{.mark}.
One way these vulnerable groups utilize indigenous knowledge is with the
traditional proficiency "of the seasonal timing of growth, development,
reproduction, and migration of organisms, which generally occurs in a
predictable sequence based on temperature thresholds, length of
daylight, moisture or other environmental
determinants\'\'.]{.underline}[17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTM2_bT65VZoNmeamG2pI1JV3egzTqs7n-znKr2xf-I/edit#bookmark=id.ljovhommp2gx)
This utilization of TEK when it comes to the weather allows for these
[[indigenous groups]{.mark} to [utilize]{.mark} sho[rt term adaptation
skills such as]{.mark} "[modifying]{.mark} the [timing]{.mark} and
[location of harvest]{.mark} activity, [adjusting]{.mark} the [mix of
species harvested]{.mark}, and [monitoring]{.mark} for [dangerous
environmental
conditions]{.mark}"]{.underline}.[18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTM2_bT65VZoNmeamG2pI1JV3egzTqs7n-znKr2xf-I/edit#bookmark=id.8jku6rkvt977)
**[Subsistence-based indigenous [groups in the Arctic]{.mark} can
[mitigate]{.mark} the impact of [climate change]{.mark} by
[utilizing]{.mark} their [TEK]{.mark} [regarding seasonal weather
patterns]{.mark} to [ensure survival]{.mark} [despite weather]{.mark}
and [temperature]{.mark} [fluctuations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[Another instance]{.mark} of utilizing indigenous knowledge to mitigate
the impact of climate change in the global north [is when]{.mark} the
[Inuit hunters]{.mark} [draw]{.mark} [upon]{.mark} their [TEK]{.mark} to
[maximize their hunting opportunities]{.mark} [while]{.mark} also
[minimizing

**[Inuit [hunting knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}** is passed down
through generations by shared actions and the oral education that
teaches "[the inherent dangers of hunting; how to evaluate risks; what
preparations to make before hunting; and what to do in emergency
situations,"[20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTM2_bT65VZoNmeamG2pI1JV3egzTqs7n-znKr2xf-I/edit#bookmark=id.w55ihx83buyd)

[Inuit TEK regarding certain resources and their anticipated seasons
allows hunters to anticipate when buck hunting season will begin because
of their traditional oral education regarding "species\' life cycles in

[the **[Anthropocene]{.mark} is [rooted in colonization]{.mark}**. For
**colonialism has always included terraforming that tears apart what
they call, following Watts, the \"flesh\"26 of human-nonhuman-ecological
relationships.** That colonizers today, from settlers to imperialists,
are concerned about climate change, suggests that they are now being
affected by the seismic waves of massive ecosystem transformation that
began over 500 years ago.]{.underline}27 Mitchell cautions against
\"[**marking European colonization as a driving force of the
Anthropocene**,\" because doing so **may \"naturalize\" colonization**.
That is, the \"**risk of equating human forms of agency with \'natural
forces\' is that they come to be seen as inevitable, determinate and
less contestable than \'political forces\'.\"**]{.underline} Mitchell
points out that \"[the **[Anthropocene is not the product of
\'humanity\']{.mark}, but [rather particular segments of
it.\"]{.mark}**28 As Indigenous peoples[, **we do not tell our

coming back. As Gross claims, [\"[Native Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}
[have [seen the end of their respective worlds]{.mark}\... Just as
importantly, though, [Indians survived the apocalypse]{.mark}. This
raises the further question, then, of [what happens to a society that
has gone through an apocalyptic event]{.mark}?\"]{.underline}29 Some
answers to Gross\' question lie in the work of Indigenous Climate Change
Studies described already in this essay. [[Indigenous imaginations of
our futures]{.mark} in relation to climate change---the stuff of
didactic science fiction ---[begin already with our living today in
post-apocalyptic situations]{.mark}. Had someone told our ancestors a
story of what today\'s times are like for Indigenous peoples, our
ancestors would surely have thought they were hearing dystopian tales.
For [Indigenous peoples live in worlds]{.mark} so [changed by
colonialism, capitalism, and industrialization]{.mark} that our
[collective self-determination and agency are compromised]{.mark} to a
degree our ancestors would have been haunted by,]{.underline}
Indigenizing our futures involves our reflecting on why our ancestors\'
would have thought today\'s times are dystopian. In our case,
[[**reflecting on why our ancestors\'** would]{.mark} have
[perceive]{.mark}d [the present as dystopian provides guidance on how to
live under post-apocalyptic conditions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Menominee Nation\'s recent development of culturally, spiritually, and
economically significant sustainable forest was actually their response
to the colonially-induced destruction of their relationships with many
species[. The transition to forestry involved envisioning and performing
certain relationships and responsibilities that would have mattered to
their ancestors---just now in relation to forest biodiversity. The
Menominee\'s relationships to the forest motivates their ongoing
leadership in addressing climate change.30 is **[Indigenous climate
justice activism]{.mark} also [about performing]{.mark} these
[ancestrally inspired visions]{.mark}**,31 **[including]{.mark} the
[recent insistence]{.mark} [by]{.mark} some [leaders of the Standing

perform futurities [that Indigenous persons can build on in generations
to come. That is, our actions today are cyclical performances; they are
guided by our reflection on our ancestors\' perspectives and on our
desire to be good ancestors ourselves to future
generations.]{.underline} Wildcat calls this performance
\"indigenuity;\" Kimmerer, \"returning the g ift\" (if we think broadly,
in a multigenerational sense, about what Kimmerer means, here).33 [**So

This relationship between the people and the environment depicted in

the world that comes from the traditional conceptualization of social

It is **[also]{.mark}** [important to include indigenous expertise in

### Science ADV

#### Current Scientists disregard TEK but it is key to understanding the current Climate Change situation

Knowledge (TEK) for Climate Change Adaptation\", Int J Environ Sci Nat

TEK is similar to Western science in that both are dynamic and evolve
over time. Further, TEK and Western science emphasize feedback learning,
and both have developed methods for dealing with the uncertainty and
unpredictability intrinsic to all ecosystems. Traditional ecological
knowledge that represents centuries of wisdom is increasingly recognized
the capacity to deal with complex systems \[15\]. A TEK approach to
understanding the complex workings of ecosystems and carefully gathered
longitudinal observations and useful knowledge that can contribute
significantly to scientific investigations. TEK is also simply an
assistant to Western quantitative approaches or as an element to be
"integrated" into Western scientific studies. Scientific knowledge is
depending on separation of the knower from the known, whereas
traditional knowledge is based on attachment. The international
community want to protect Indigenous traditional knowledge, Since 1980
\[16\]. Traditional science and western science have both similarities
and differences. Both kinds of knowledge are eventually based on
observations of the environment, and both result from the same
intellectual process of creating order. However, they are different in
several practical ways. Traditional Ecological Knowledge is often a
fundamental part of a culture and tends to have a large social context.
Despite of different kinds of traditional knowledge have their own
rules, they are different from science regarding rules of evidence and
repeatability. [The way [TEK is produced and disseminated is different
from the Western science]{.mark}, and sometimes [Western scientists do
not]{.mark} have [view]{.mark}ed [TEK as science]{.mark}, but as
folklore \[17\]. The [conflict]{.mark} that sometimes [happen between
science and traditional knowledge is related to claims of authority over
knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the modern tradition,
[[Western]{.mark} [science is taken as having a monopoly on
truth.]{.mark} Western science is not easily accepted the Knowledge and
insights that originated outside institution. [Scientists tend to
dismiss understandings that do not fit their own which affect the
development of TEK]{.mark}.]{.underline} Scientists incline to be
unconvinced, demanding evidence when confronted with traditional
knowledge that may not easily lend itself to scientific verification.
Based on research carried out in the Arctic, five areas are identified
in which science and TEK can communicate and collaborate, using TEK
\[10\]. The identified area includes: - Localscale expertise; As a
source of climate history and baseline data; In formulating research
questions and hypotheses; As insight into impacts and adaptation in
communities; [For long-term community-based monitoring
[T]{.mark}raditional [e]{.mark}cological [k]{.mark}nowledge can [make
significant contributions in assessing the impacts of climate
change]{.mark} and in identifying strategies for climate change
adaptation.]{.underline}

#### Arctic Science, absent considerations of indigenous frameworks, [replicates]{.underline} colonialism and becomes imperial -- challenging Euro-American Norms is key.

[We start with [scientist]{.mark}s. Their concepts and research
[practices have accompanied efforts to **conquer, cajole, civilize,
capitalize, consume, and conserve** the far north]{.mark} since the late
1800s.]{.underline} It may feel odd for some readers to link the pursuit
of truths about the natural world with colonialism, especially in such a
sparsely populated zone. But reflect for a moment on the most popular
chapter of Arctic history: the search for the North Pole[. As historians
have deftly shown, American, Danish, and Norwegian [explorers scoured
the Arctic]{.mark} Ocean at the turn of the twentieth century not simply
to seek out adventure but to find the world's remaining unclaimed lands.
They returned south as national heroes because they expanded their home
country's territorial possessions. Redrawing maps to display their
discoveries, they sprinkled the names of sponsors on bays, islands,
straits, [and]{.mark} narrows. In these material ways, explorers
[**extended Euro-­ American authority**]{.mark} over the Arctic.3 Like
their maps, [explorers' tales about an Arctic terra incognita and savage
Inuit helped southerners claim the north. With their words, they painted
the Arctic as isolated and inhospitable.]{.mark} At times, [they
portrayed Inuit communities as backward for relying on Stone Age
technologies for survival and primitive because they appeared to know
neither religion nor law. In other instances, Inuit were
strong]{.mark}---­ superhuman, even---­ [for subsisting in an environment
without trees, warmth, or readily accessible game.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Historians analyze these depictions of the Arctic in relation to when
they were produced and the dramas playing out at that time. Explorers'
narratives were products of metropolitan societies concerned with the
effects of overcivilization, a softness emerging from the urban
existence that replaced life on the farm over the end of the nineteenth
century. [[Those who consumed scientific ideas measured the Arctic
against the norms of the Euro-American experience, reifying that
experience as superior. An exotic place, one uninfluenced by machines
and morality, then, was not an objective observation, but a view through
**imperial eyes**.]{.mark}4]{.underline} The ways historians have
unpacked polar exploration illustrates the conceptual framework of this
book. That is, scientific representations of Arctic nature are entangled
with human interventions in the region. A map of the North Pole in 1909
was not an exact reproduction of the physical environment of coastlines
and ocean currents. Instead, it was a document born from particular
field experiences in particular places and widely held desires for
global dominance. Philosopher Ian Hacking puts it this way: "Science is
said to have two aims: theory and experiment. Theories try to say how
the world is. Experiment and subsequent technology change the world. We
represent and we intervene. We represent in order to intervene, and we
intervene in light of our representations." Perhaps readers already
understand this relationship intuitively, given the adage "knowledge is
power."5 [[Polar exploration]{.mark} is just one example of the pursuit
of knowledge [**converging with colonial ambition** in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Ideas of nature changed over time.
New paradigms pushed researchers to ask different questions about the
north just as human activity there altered the environment, requiring
continued analysis. I use the term scientist to refer to an unwieldy
group of people, from museum-­ based naturalists in the late 1800s to
geophysicists working for military agencies during World War II to
ecologists translating research into political activism in the 1960s.
The differences among them are many, but what they share is this: at the
moment they appear in this book, they compete for the mantle on
definitive questions of scientific understanding, natural resource
management, and national development. In these ways, the nineteenth-­
century specimen collector inhabits a social and intellectual space
similar to the climate scientist today. By bringing these practitioners
together in this way, we thread diverse representations and
interventions in different historical periods in a line---­ thus
reconnecting the Arctic's colonial past with its present.6

MacFarlane's work deserves more interpretation, because even without a
corpus to his name, he projected a powerful representation of the north.
His Arctic natural history was a by-product of a mutually beneficial
flow of material goods between Inuit trappers on one hand and British
and Russian fur traders on the other. [Yet this [flow of goods induced
fear in Russian and British fur companies as each vied for **total
control of Inuit lands**, but failed to attain it. British audiences
grew accustomed to stories of]{.mark} the dangerous Arctic. Its bone-­
chilling climate, extreme stretches of light and dark, and notoriously
"barren" landscape had all vexed British naval officers in search of a
North- west Passage during the mid-­ 1800s. MacFarlane's scant written
material and sketches added another element to these treacherous
conditions: in his mind, [Arctic indigenes]{.mark} were [equally **as
hostile** as the physical environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 1891,
Roderick MacFarlane published a summary of his 1857 journey down the
Anderson River in the Canadian Record of Science. He tempered his
optimism about the natural resources of the Anderson River area with his
interactions with Dene and Inuit. MacFarlane traveled with an Inuit
"chief" between the lower stretch of the river and a larger camp of
Inuit families stationed at its mouth in Liverpool Bay (figure 1). Here,
a fleet of Inuit canoes and kayaks overtook his party, which, according
to the British fur trader, immediately displayed their intent to engage
in battle. "Seven guns were held up to intimate to us that they were as
well armed as our- selves," MacFarlane wrote. He abandoned negotiations
with these coastal Inuit, deciding to ditch his boats and walk seven
days back to his camp upriver to avoid further confrontation. [With
similar expedience, he blamed this altercation on historic Inuit-Dene
tensions around the fur trade. He did not acknowledge, however, that
extending the Hudson's Bay Company's reach northward to the Arctic coast
surely agitated Native northerners and their trading
networks]{.underline}.12 This chronicle of events repeats a well-worn
trope within Hudson's Bay Company lore about [the Heroic Fur Trader and
the Hostile Natives]{.underline}. In 1771, Samuel Hearne had traveled
down the Coppermine River with Dene guides, hoping to initiate trade
relations with the Inuit living near the Coronation Gulf. According to
Hearne, his Dene guides ambushed a party of Inuit, murdering twenty men,
women, and children. In 1799, Duncan Livingston at- tempted to replicate
Alexander Mackenzie's 1789 journey down the Mackenzie River to the
Arctic Ocean. After meeting a group of Inuit below Arctic Red River,
Livingston's entire crew was apparently killed. Hearne and Livingston's
experiences became legend, preserved in accounts that circulated
throughout the Company for the next seven or eight decades.
[MacFarlane's [representation of the western Arctic]{.mark}, then, [fit
in]{.mark}to [a well-defined set of]{.mark} representations and
interventions under [British imperialism in northern North
America]{.mark}.13 With [the frame]{.mark} of these existing Company
stories, MacFarlane's experience along the Anderson River
[encourage]{.mark}d him to promote [the **notion of Inuit as naturally
antagonistic**, aggressive,]{.mark} and
[inhospitable]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To his Hudson's Bay Company
superiors, he described Native northerners as tall and well-formed
(figure 2). He worried about their ["[rather troublesome"]{.mark}
character [and]{.mark} their [tendency to steal]{.mark} if not carefully
supervised by white men]{.underline}. When corresponding with Émile
Petitot, a missionary stationed in the Mackenzie Delta during the 1860s,
however, [MacFarlane disclosed a deeper criticism of Inuit. [Inuit were
**"sea bandits, who looked on theft, violence, deceit, unbridled
libertinism, and even murder as virtues in which they took pride**,
while their womenfolk were shameless courtesans."]{.mark} Here was clear
evidence of MacFarlane's views of Inuit, and how he tailored them for
his [imperial audience]{.mark}.14 MacFarlane's thoughts on Inuit were
not contained to the page. They [directly influenced the architecture of
empire in the north.]{.mark} Take the construction of [Fort
Anderson]{.mark}. The fur post [was the physical embodiment of outside
intervention, a space wherein British traders extracted profits from the
Arctic and displaced its natural resources.]{.mark} [Because]{.mark}
MacFarlane and many of his [associates feared Inuit, the Company built
Fort Anderson to allow careful surveillance of all activities inside and
outside its walls.]{.mark} According one British trader's description,
the site of trade negotiations was "surrounded by a square palisade
about fifty-­ five yards long with a twenty-­ foot-­ high bastion at each
corner." Given that the Arctic did not allow for easy shipping---­ and
provided few trees---­ the lengths to which the Company sought to secure
Fort Anderson are telling.]{.underline} They speak not only to the value
of mercantilism but also to the perception of danger that accompanied
imperial exchange in the Arctic.15 [[In most analyses of colonialism,
**scientific representations foster exploitation** because they allow
administrators in distant locations to read the landscape according to
**colonial desires**.]{.mark} In other words, scientific stories and
images make a foreign and confusing space legible---­ [they rationalize
nature for the purposes of resource extraction.]{.mark}]{.underline}
MacFarlane's Arctic reflects a different kind of imperial experience, an
exception to what became the rule in colonialism's next century. The
dangerous Arctic indicates illegibility, the inability to bring the
region into the orbit of British power. MacFarlane's science nurtured an
aching frustration that Inuit and the Arctic environment would always
get the better of the Hudson's Bay Company.16

[This work was co-created in a spring 2022 graduate course developed and
taught by the corresponding author entitled, *Applied Indigenous
Research Methods: Considerations for Incorporating TEK into Federal
Decision-Making*. In this class, we participated in lectures, hosted by
tribal leaders and experts, presented in graduate student-led journal
clubs, and unpacked how some Indigenous communities use Indigenous
Traditional Ecological Knowledge (ITEK) in their governmental
decision-making. The goal was to produce a collaboratively written
document to share with key decision-makers at the Environmental
Protection Agency and the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy. The final product is the result of key topics chosen and written
by graduate students, aforementioned tribal leaders, and the
instructor.According to the 2020 US Census Bureau, of the 331 million
people in the USA, 9.7 million (3%) self-identify as American Indian and
Alaska Native (AIAN) under one race or in combination of up to six races
([[US Census Bureau,
2021]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr57-11771801241235279)).
The US Department of the Interior has recorded 574 current federally
recognized tribes across 48 states, including Alaska ([[US Bureau of
Indian Affairs,

In addition, there are approximately 400 non-federally recognized
Indigenous communities located in various US territories, including
Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas, the Republic of
the Marshall Islands, the US Virgin Islands, the Republic of Palau, and
the Federated States of Micronesia ([[Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation \[ACHP\],
2018]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr1-11771801241235279);

These communities include those who do not have formal
government-to-government relationships with the US Government as a
result of militarization and or policies that make them ineligible for
federal recognition ([[ACHP,
2018]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr1-11771801241235279);

US federal government has unique treaties and trust responsibilities
with each of these federally recognized tribes. In this context, tribes
are sovereign nations under the US Constitution, and through treaties,
executive orders, statutes, and court decisions. However, upholding
tribal sovereignty and treaty rights has been historically and
contemporarily challenged by bureaucratic dead ends, genocide, and
blatant disregard for these legal obligations. It was not until the
1970s, under President Richard Nixon, that federal Indian policy
declared a direct commitment to ending the Termination policy and moved
toward a policy of Self-Determination. Over the years, this commitment
has been unsteady at best and highly inconsistent across federal
agencies. While any incremental change, both legally and socially, is
not to be overlooked, federal commitments from US presidents and
Congress have had broad, sweeping implications. Without being codified
by Congress, executive orders can turnover as quickly as political
administrations. Still, these executive actions have been an important
tool to leverage opportunities for reclaiming Indigenous power at the
federal decision-making table.Since his inauguration in 2021, President
Biden has signed a series of executive orders, memoranda, and directives
that positively impact tribal nations. For example, the Biden-Harris
Plan for tribal nations outlines a new US commitment to tribal
relations. All executive departments and agencies have been directed to
review this plan and take action accordingly. In addition, as mentioned
in a November 2021 Memorandum, the Biden administration is currently
developing guidelines for its commitment to incorporating ITEK into
federal decision-making and policy processes ([[Lander & Mallory,
2021]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr33-11771801241235279)).
Also, on March 16, 2021, the administration confirmed the first Native
American, Deb Haaland, as Secretary of the Department of the Interior.
These have all been welcome changes to Indigenous communities. Still,
while the government acknowledges that ITEK is essential in making
contemporary environmental decisions, most Indigenous Peoples
understandably have concerns about collaborating with the government.
These concerns are rooted in the long-standing historical precedence of
the federal government collecting, citing, and misusing their
information. To remedy this, first and foremost, a working relationship
between tribal nations and the US Government requires acknowledgment of
the harmful and traumatic legacies witnessed by Indigenous Peoples at
the hand of these federal policies. As well, a genuine effort by the
government to repair the current material conditions endured by
Indigenous Peoples must be undertaken, combined with efforts toward
accountability, justice, and reconciliation.]{.mark}

[The USA currently faces complex, multi-layered environmental challenges
linked to hundreds of years of resource expropriation and related land
degradation. The current crisis highlights the gap in scientific
research and resource management approaches that are rooted in
experimental reductionism ([[World Health Organization,
2021]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr65-11771801241235279)).
Now that centuries-old land management strategies have brought forth
widespread global failures; a growing interest to rethink power
inequality and ways of reexamining all our relations has emerged. As a
result, many groups have begun to turn to Indigenous Peoples for their
expertise, wisdom, and knowledge as a means to curtail the unfolding
environmental catastrophes ([[Roothaan,
2019]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr42-11771801241235279)).
[Tribal leaders have long advocated for ITEK to be included in US
processes and are finally gaining traction due to the urgency of the
unfolding climate crisis. However, to foster the successful and
equitable inclusion of ITEK into federal decision-making, there needs to
be active work to disrupt well-established colonial dynamics and offer
space for transformative and restorative work where Indigenous voices
are at the forefront ([Gagnon-Bouchard & Ranger,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr16-11771801241235279)).
To address these challenges, an interdisciplinary approach that
effectively and respectfully embeds knowledge plurality into the process
will need to be considered. In the context of Indigenous Peoples in the
USA, this will require a deep understanding of the history of tribal
nations and the genocide and epistemicide endured at the hands of US
Government policies and citizens.In]{.underline} this work, we seek to
discuss both the importance of moving toward ITEK, given the severe
state of imbalance that the natural world is in, and the ethical
considerations needed to approach Indigenous Peoples and ITEK with
proper care, respect, and integrity. In short, though ITEK is a vital
part of land restoration and rehabilitation, the authors advise the US
Government to first center Indigenous Peoples and their sovereignty in
efforts to integrate ITEK into federal policy. Following these
recommendations is imperative to the success of ITEK implementation in
federal policy because Indigenous systems of knowledge are embedded in
Indigenous relationships with the land and other non-human beings, that
is, ITEK, Indigenous Peoples, and the land are inextricably linked.
Further, preserving and strengthening ITEK, while maintaining and
increasing Indigenous sovereignty, can begin a process of justice,
accountability, and reconciliation.]{.mark}

#### Ignoring Indigenous Knowledge in Climate adaptation reinvests in epistemological violence and destroys the potential for equitable partnerships

[Indigenous knowledge is inextricably linked to cultural heritage,
identity, and social cohesion**. Ignoring this knowledge not only
undermines effective adaptation but also contributes to the erosion of
Indigenous cultures and social structures**. When adaptation projects
disregard Indigenous values and practices, they]{.underline} can
[disrupt traditional livelihoods, weaken community bonds, and erode
cultural transmission across generations. This cultural disruption can
further marginalize Indigenous communities and diminish their capacity
to adapt to climate change and other challenges.]{.underline}
[Respecting]{.underline} and integrating [Indigenous knowledge is
therefore essential for both effective climate action and the
preservation of cultural diversity]{.underline}. A teal and white
cormorant, perched on broken branches against a dark background,
symbolizes vulnerability, urging action on sustainable forestry to
safeguard the habitat needed for biodiversity and implement ecosystem
monitoring in natural resource management. Its image speaks to urgent
challenges of anthropocentric climate hazards, irresponsible resource
extraction, avian conservation and habitat loss mitigation needed for
climate resilience alongside circular economy methodologies. Climate
change implications highlight the paradigm for natural capital
preservation. Collaborative Solutions → [Climate change adaptation
requires collaborative efforts and diverse perspectives. Ignoring
Indigenous knowledgeIgnoring Indigenous knowledge in sustainability has
ethical implications because it disrespects their wisdom, undermines
their rights, and perpetuates harmful practices.]{.underline}
[represents a missed opportunity to build partnerships and co-create
innovative, culturally appropriate, and effective
solutions]{.underline}. Engaging with Indigenous communities as equal
partners, recognizing their knowledge as a valuable asset, and fostering
knowledge exchange can lead to more robust and equitable adaptation
outcomes. [Collaborative approaches that integrate Indigenous knowledge
with scientific expertise can bridge knowledge gaps, enhance mutual
understanding, and build trust, leading to more sustainable and just
climate adaptation for all. A withering husk stands against the void
showcasing sustainable materials and product life
extension.]{.underline} With its elongated form in a teal shade,
textures express a shift from healthy to unsustainable practices that
requires more awareness in the area of climate change mitigation.
Implementing environmental impact assessments becomes key. Ignoring
Indigenous knowledge in climate change adaptationIntegrate robust data,
diverse models, continuous monitoring, and adaptable governance to
ensure AI-powered climate adaptation solutions are resilient to future
impacts. is not merely a technical oversight; it is a systemic failure
with profound implications for resilience, equity, and the long-term
sustainability of adaptation efforts. This disregard stems from
historical power imbalances, epistemic biases, and a persistent
undervaluing of non-Western knowledge systems. The consequences are
far-reaching, impacting ecological integrity, social justice, and the
very effectiveness of global climate action. An agave\'s striking
architectural form symbolizes water conservation in drought tolerant
landscapes, showcasing resilience and adaptation to climate change
within a sustainable ecosystem. Its presence illustrates biodiversity
promotion through xeriscaping techniques enhancing ecological balance
and habitat preservation while offering carbon sequestration potential
in arid land environments. Showcasing environmental stewardship this
hardy succulent embodies ecological integrity. Epistemicide → The
systematic dismissal of Indigenous knowledge can be understood as a form
of [epistemicide]{.underline} → the killing of knowledge systems. This
[occurs when dominant knowledge paradigms, often rooted in Western
scientific traditions, invalidate or marginalize other ways of knowing.
In the context of climate change adaptation, this **epistemicide leads
to the loss of invaluable ecological insights, traditional resource
management practices, and culturally specific adaptation strategies that
have been developed and refined over millennia**]{.underline}. This loss
is not just a cultural tragedy; **[it represents a significant reduction
in the global knowledge base available to address climate
change]{.underline}**. The consequences of epistemicide extend beyond
the immediate loss of knowledge, undermining the capacity of future
generations to learn from and build upon these rich traditions.
Epistemicide, in this context, refers to the systematic destruction or
marginalization of Indigenous knowledge systems, often through the
imposition of dominant, often Western, knowledge paradigms. Dark water
droplets on an egg shape with needle emphasize climate vulnerability and
unsustainable practices. Precision water resource management is also
visible. This showcases potential harm to fragile ecosystems and
environmental stewardship and eco-design through resource depletion and
invasive resource usage with impact on hydrologic cycles. Maladaptive
Outcomes → Adapt[ation strategies that disregard Indigenous knowledge
are prone to maladaptive outcomes, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities
and creating new ones]{.underline}. [Conventional adaptation approaches,
often focused on technological solutions or large-scale infrastructure
projects, may fail to account for the complex social-ecological dynamics
of specific regions. Indigenous knowledge, in contrast, offers holistic
perspectives that consider the interconnectedness of human and natural
systems.]{.underline} For example, promoting drought-resistant crop
varieties without understanding traditional seed saving practices or
local soil conditions can undermine long-term food security. Similarly,
constructing seawalls without considering traditional coastal management
techniques may disrupt natural defenses and increase vulnerability to
sea-level rise in the long run. Ignoring Indigenous knowledge thus
increases the risk of implementing solutions that are not only
ineffective but also actively harmful. Maladaptation is not simply a
failure to adapt effectively; it is an active process that creates new
vulnerabilities and undermines long-term resilience, often stemming from
a disregard for local and Indigenous knowledge. A teal orb cradled in
fractured material symbolizes the urgency for sustainable solutions.
Emphasizing the crucial intersection between ecological restoration and
circular economy within our threatened environment, this artistic
rendition reminds us of climate resilience challenges in the face of
unsustainable production. Biodiversity conservation, corporate social
responsibility and minimizing carbon footprint offer hope amidst
environmental degradation to foster renewable energy adoption for
climate equilibrium that safeguards against further losses of planetary
protection. Social Disruption → [**Climate change adaptation
interventions that ignore Indigenous knowledge can lead to significant
social and cultural disruption**. These interventions may undermine
traditional governance systems, land tenure arrangements, and cultural
practices that are integral to community well-being and
resilience]{.underline}. For instance, imposing protected areas for
conservation without respecting Indigenous land rights and traditional
resource use can lead to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and social
conflict. Furthermore, adaptation projects that fail to incorporate
Indigenous cultural values and worldviews may be perceived as culturally
insensitive or even colonial, eroding trust and hindering community
participation. [This social disruption weakens the adaptive capacity of
Indigenous communities and undermines the long-term sustainability of
adaptation efforts.]{.underline}

### Framing 

#### '[Extinction first']{.underline} is a narrative of settler futurity that legitimizes racial defensiveness and violence against Native people---it makes decolonization [inconceivable]{.underline}.

colonialism: extinction as a metaphor of decolonization in contemporary
settler literature"; 10/4/16; Settler Colonial Studies Vol. 8 No. 1;

[[Settlers]{.mark} [love]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [contemplate the
**possibility of their own extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}; to read
many contemporary literary representations of settler colonialism is to
find [settlers strangely [satisfied]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [dreaming of
ends that never come]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [tendency is widely
prevalent in English-language representations of settler colonialism
produced]{.underline} since the 1980s: the possibility of an ending --
[the [likelihood]{.mark} that [the settler race will]{.mark} one day
[die out]{.mark} -- is a common [theme]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
literary and pop culture [[considerations of colonialism's
future]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet it has barely been remarked how
surprising it is that this theme is so present. [For settlers, of all
people, to obsessively ruminate on their own finitude is
counterintuitive, for few modern social formations have been more
resistant to change than settler colonialism]{.underline}. With a few
exceptions (French Algeria being the largest), the settler societies
established in the last 300 years in the Americas, Australasia, and
Southern Africa have all retained the basic features that define them as
settler states -- namely, the structural privileging of settlers at the
expense of indigenous peoples, and the normalization of whiteness as the
marker of political agency and rights -- and they have done so
notwithstanding the sustained resistance that has been mounted whenever
such an order has been built. [[Settlers]{.mark} [think]{.mark} all the
time that [they might one day end]{.mark}, [even]{.mark} [though
(perhaps because) that ending seems **unlikely**]{.mark} ever to happen.
The significance of this paradox for settler-colonial literature is the
subject of this article.]{.underline}

[Considering the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to traditional
analyses of settlercolonial narrative]{.underline}, which typically
[examine settlers' attitudes towards history in order to highlight a
constitutive anxiety about the past -- about origins. [Settler]{.mark}
[colonialism]{.mark},]{.underline} the argument goes, [has a problem
with [historical narration]{.mark} that [arises]{.mark} [from]{.mark} a
[contradiction]{.mark} [in]{.mark} its [founding
mythology]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Stephen Turner's formulation, [the
settler subject is by definition one who comes from elsewhere but who
strives to make this place home. The settlement narrative must explain
how this gap -- which is at once geographical, historical, and
existential]{.underline} -- has been bridged, and the settler
transformed from [[outsider into]{.mark} [indigene]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Yet [the [transformation]{.mark} [must]{.mark} [remain]{.mark}
constitutively [incomplete]{.mark}, because the desire to be at home
necessarily invokes the spectre of the native, whose existence (which
cannot be disavowed completely because it is needed to define the
settler's difference, superiority, and hence claim to the land)
inscribes the settler's foreignness]{.underline}, thus [reinstating the
gap between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to
efface]{.underline}.1 [Settler-colonial [narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}
is thus [[shaped]{.mark} around its need [to **erase** and **evoke** the
native]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[to make the indigene]{.mark}
both [invisible]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [present]{.mark} in a contradictory
pattern [that]{.mark} [prevents settlers]{.mark} [from]{.mark} ever
[moving]{.mark} [on from]{.mark} the moment of
[colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 As evidence of this constitutive
contradiction, critics have identified in settler-colonial discourse
symptoms of psychic distress such as disavowal, inversion, and
repression.3 Indeed, the frozen temporality of settler-colonial
narrative, fixated on the moment of the frontier, recalls nothing so
much as Freud's description of the 'repetition compulsion' attending
trauma.4 As Lorenzo Veracini puts it, because:

'settler society' can thus be seen as a fantasy where a perception of a
constant struggle is juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can
never be reached, settler projects embrace and reject violence at the
same time. The settler colonial situation is thus a circumstance where
the tension between contradictory impulses produces long-lasting psychic
conflicts and a number of associated psychopathologies.5

[Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on settler-colonial
narrative's view of the past]{.underline}, asking how such a
contradictory and troubled relationship to history might affect
present-day ideological formations. Critics have rarely considered what
such narratological tensions might produce when the settler gaze is
turned to the future. [Few social formations are more stubbornly
resistant to change than settlement, suggesting that a future beyond
settler colonialism might be simply **unthinkable**.]{.underline}
Veracini, indeed, suggests that settler-colonial narrative can never
contemplate an ending: that [settler [decolonization]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[inconceivable]{.mark} [because]{.mark} [settlers]{.mark} [lack]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} metaphorical [tools]{.mark} [to imagine their own
demise]{.mark}]{.underline}.6 This article outlines why I partly
disagree with that view. I argue that the narratological paradox that
defines settler-colonial narrative does make the future a problematic
object of contemplation. But that does not make settler decolonization
unthinkable per se; as I will show, [settlers do often try to imagine
their demise -- but [they do so in a way that reasserts the paradoxes of
their founding ideology]{.mark}, with the result that the radical
potentiality of [decolonization]{.mark} [is undone even as it is
invoked]{.mark}.]{.underline}

I argue that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis, there is a metaphor
via which the end of settler colonialism unspools -- the
quasi-biological concept of extinction, which, when deployed as a
narrative trope, offers settlers a chance to consider and disavow their
demise, just as they consider and then disavow the violence of their
origins. This article traces the importance of the trope of extinction
for contemporary settler-colonial literature, with a focus on South
Africa, Canada, and Australia. It explores variations in how the death
of settler colonialism is conceptualized, drawing a distinction between
historio-civilizational narratives of the rise and fall of empires, and
a species-oriented notion of extinction that draws force from public
anxiety about climate change -- an invocation that adds another level of
ambivalence by drawing on 'rational' fears for the future (because
climate change may well render the planet uninhabitable to humans) in
order to narrativize a form of social death that, strictly speaking,
belongs to a different order of knowledge altogether. As such, my
analysis is intended to draw the attention of [settlercolonial studies
toward futurity and the ambivalence of **settler
paranoia**]{.underline}, while highlighting a potential point of
cross-fertilization between settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches
to contemporary literature.

[That 'extinction' should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon
is no surprise]{.underline}. In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7 [settler
colonialism is predicated on a 'logic of elimination' that tends towards
the **extermination**]{.underline} -- by one means or another -- [of
indigenous peoples]{.underline}.8 This logic is apparent in archetypal
settler narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans
(1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the melancholia and
triumph that demarcate settlers' affective responses to the supposed
inevitability of indigenous extinction. Concepts like 'stadial
development' -- by which [societies progress through stages,
progressively [eliminating]{.mark} [earlier]{.mark} [social]{.mark}
[forms]{.mark} -- and '**fatal impact'** -- which [names the
**biological inevitability of strong peoples supplanting
weak**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- all [contribute to the [notion]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} settler [colonialism]{.mark} is [a]{.mark} kind of
'[ecological process']{.mark} 9 [that]{.mark} [necessitates]{.mark} the
**[extinction]{.mark}** of inferior races]{.underline}. What is
surprising, though, is how often the trope of extinction also appears
with reference to settlers themselves; it makes sense for settlers to
narrate how their presence entails others' destruction, but it is less
clear why their attempts to imagine futures should presume extinction to
be their own logical end as well.

The idea appears repeatedly in English-language literary treatments of
settler colonialism. Consider, for instance, the following rumination on
the future of South African settler society, from Olive Schreiner's 1883
Story of an African Farm:

It was one of them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those
pictures there. He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make
something, so he made these. \[...\] Now the Boers have shot them all,
so that we never see a yellow face peeping out among the stones. \[...\]
And the wild bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we
will be gone soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at
everything like they look now.10

In this example, the narrating settler character, Waldo, recognizes
prior indigenous inhabitation but his knowledge comes freighted with an
expected sense of biological superiority, made apparent by his
description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow face', and lack of mental
self-awareness. What is not clear is why Waldo's contemplation of
colonial genocide should turn immediately to the assumption that a
similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar presumption of racial
vulnerability permeates other late nineteenthcentury novels from the
imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of the Worlds, 32 H. DALLEY
which are plotted around the prospect of invasions that would see the
extinction of British imperialism, and, in the process, the human
species.

Such [anxieties [draw]{.mark} energy [from]{.mark} a pattern of
[**settler defensiveness**]{.mark} that can be observed across numerous
**settler-colonial contexts**]{.underline}**.** Marilyn Lake's and Henry
Reynold's account of the emergence of transnational 'whiteness'
highlights the [paradoxical fact that while white male [settlers]{.mark}
have been arguably the [most privileged class]{.mark} in history, they
have [routinely]{.mark} [perceived themselves to be '**under
siege'**]{.mark}, threatened with destruction]{.underline} to the extent
that their very identity of '[[whiteness]{.mark} [was born in the
apprehension of imminent loss']{.mark}]{.underline}. 11 [The fear of
looming annihilation serves a powerful ideological function in settler
communities, working to [foster]{.mark} [racial]{.mark}
[solidarity]{.mark}, su[ppress dissent, and legitimate violence against
indigenous populations]{.mark}]{.underline} [[who]{.underline}]{.mark},
by any objective measure, [[are]{.mark} [far]{.mark} [more at risk of
extermination]{.mark} than the settlers who fear them]{.underline}. Ann
Curthoys and Dirk Moses have traced this pattern in Australia and
Israel-Palestine, respectively.12 This scholarship suggests that
[[narratives]{.mark} of settler extinction are [acts of]{.mark}
[ideological]{.mark} [mystification]{.mark}, [obscuring]{.mark} the
brutal [inequalities]{.mark} of the frontier [behind a mask of **white
vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- an argument with which I
sympathize. However, this article shows how there is more to
settler-colonial extinction narratives than bad faith. I argue that we
need a more nuanced understanding of how they encode a specifically
settler-colonial framework for imagining the future, one that has
implications for how we understand contemporary literatures from settler
societies, and which allows us to see extinction as a genuine, if
flawed, attempt to envisage social change.

### IK key to Medicine 

#### Traditional medicine is imperative for treating global medical crises.

3\. THE WAY FORWARD The CBD and Nagoya Protocol encourages the use of
traditional medicine.105 Many indigenous and local communities have
awoken to the effectiveness of their indigenous practices for purposes
of healthcare and it is working for them.106 In 1996, Clement, a
western‐styled accountant but also a member of an indigenous local
community was involved in a serious motor accident and was rushed to the
hospital. He fractured the bones in his left hand and was told by the
doctors that he would have to amputate the hand because it was hopeless.
Someone directed him to a traditional/herbal practitioner who was
skilled in rearranging bones. The traditional herbal healer assured him
that he had seen and treated worse cases. He was treated with herbs,
leaves and ointments and after about 4 months, the use of his hand was
restored. It\'s been over 24 years now and Clement\'s hand is still in
excellent shape. Many members of western communities have embraced the
use of traditional medicine by using herbal and natural products.107
[The [coronavirus]{.mark} **pandemic** is [remind]{.mark}ing [the
**world** that **traditional**]{.mark} [medicine **preceded** western
medicine]{.mark} and that the TK passed down from **generation** to
**generation** on how to diagnose, prevent and **treat sick people** is
an **effective** mean for our **healthcare** problems]{.underline}.108
The indigenous and local communities therefore have a responsibility to
draw on this knowledge and help the world at this precarious time. It
could be that the solution to addressing the problems associated with
the coronavirus has been passed down from our ancestors and that the
answers to the coronavirus is right with us. There is
**[therefore]{.underline}** a duty on the indigenous and local
communities to look inward and see how to join hands in combatting this
pandemic. [[It is]{.mark} also [imperative that the]{.mark}
[**scientific community** **recognise** the role of **traditional
medicine**]{.mark} in the **battle**]{.underline} against COVID‐19, and
that they ensure that they do not ignore the cure because of bias and
scepticism. It is not correct to think or say that the global south is
merely a 'user community' and do not have a productive role to play in
the global search for a cure.109 Governments of the global south should
launch ambitious private and public sector collaborative research
initiative with the goal of finding a cure for coronavirus using local
resources just like the developed countries are looking for vaccines.
Why should we think that the global south does not have a productive
role to play in the global search for a cure? Success lies in the hands
of those who dare to try. [Once, a prominent IP scholar asked whether
'[Creativity]{.mark} has **died** [in the third world]{.mark}?'.110
There is no doubt that it [has **not died**]{.mark}**,** [only]{.mark}
that it has **[flourished]{.mark}** and **COVID** provides a great
opportunity for **Traditional Medicinal Knowledge**.]{.underline} 4.
CONCLUSION The battle against this virus should not be seen as a
competition (who will be the first to find the cure) but rather as a
rescue mission (let us save the vulnerable). This mindset is imperative
because the goal is to work in the public interest, that is, the
greatest good for the greatest number of people. The coronavirus [[is a
global pandemic]{.mark} that [requires **collaborative
efforts**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The global north is working hard, and
their governments and funding organisations are providing the needed
support. The global south also has a role to play and should be active
in this search either via western or traditional medicine. The
traditional medicine communities (made up of indigenous local
communities) must also join hands to find a cure. This article is a
clarion call to all stakeholders, governments and funding organisations
to support the search for a cure, be it through western or traditional
medicine. No one should throw spanners in the wheel of progress. What is
required is support and encouragement. It is important for guidelines to
be adhered to, [but [scepticism must **not be allowed** to debar]{.mark}
the possible **[contributions]{.mark}** [from **traditional
medicine**]{.mark} and from **indigenous** and **local
communities**]{.underline}. The global south should rally around
themselves and not allow external influences frustrate internal efforts.
The call is for all interest groups to collaborate towards the same goal
because we achieve more when we are together than when we are divided.

The move is "setting a tone that tribes should be treated with respect,
as sovereign nations," said Chuck Hoskin Jr., principal chief of the
Cherokee Nation, the largest tribe in the U.S. with 440,000 enrolled
citizens. [The federal guidance]{.underline}, issued in late 2022,
[calls on agencies to draw on indigenous]{.underline} "observations,
oral and written [knowledge, innovations, practices, and beliefs" in
their policies and programs]{.underline}. Public health agencies
including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National
Institutes of Health were part of an interagency working group that
drafted the guidance document. And indigenous researchers say public
health could be a particularly important frontier for integrating tribal
knowledge. "[Success cannot be defined solely in terms of how this will
benefit Native people,"]{.underline} said Angela Gonzales, an associate
professor at Arizona State University and enrolled citizen of the Hopi
Nation. "[We also need to ensure Indigenous Knowledge is]{.underline}
equitably understood and [infused throughout the entire health care
delivery and research process."]{.underline} [Diabetes is a prime
example]{.underline}, says Valarie Blue Bird Jernigan, the executive
director at the Center for Indigenous Health Research and Policy at
Oklahoma State University and a citizen of the Choctaw tribe. [The high
prevalence of diabetes among indigenous people reflects the consequences
of forced removal from their land]{.underline}, underfunded healthcare,
and inadequate access to healthy foods over many generations, says Blue
Bird Jernigan. She explains that many tribal members, including herself,
grew up consuming commodity packages, or government-provided foods that
are typically heavily processed with low nutritional value[. Tribal
health systems have focused on treating diabetes once it arises, rather
than prevention efforts]{.underline}, perpetuating the belief that
diabetes is inevitable. Blue Bird Jernigan saw an opportunity to change
this. In 2018, she partnered with the Osage Nation of Oklahoma to
implement a nutrition curriculum across nine tribally-owned and operated
preschools to educate kids about vegetables and their parents about
traditional food cultivation and preparation practices. The program also
includes hands-on activities at Bird Creek Farm, a "sustainable
community agricultural resource" for Osage youth, elders, and future
generations, with the goal of promoting indigenous food sovereignty and
reducing dependence on government-provided food. By involving children
and parents, Blue Bird Jernigan says her approach appeals to local
values that emphasize a community's responsibility to consider
sustainability and diabetes prevention "across multiple generations."
This differs from standard interventions, which prioritize individual
goals such as weight loss. Now, as the first tribal member to join the
federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Blue Bird Jernigan says
she'll bring her experience to developing national dietary guidance that
is inclusive of diverse racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and cultural
backgrounds. "As a community-engaged researcher I value lived
experiential knowledge as much as scientific knowledge," Blue Bird
Jernigan said. [The COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the effectiveness
of Indigenous Knowledge in controlling infectious disease]{.underline}.
Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute and a
citizen of the Pawnee Nation, says ["the most successful COVID-19
interventions were done by the tribal communities themselves," with many
tribes implementing quarantine measures weeks before state
agencies]{.underline} issued similar directives. [These initiatives were
grounded in Indigenous Knowledge of how past epidemics]{.underline},
such as Hepatitis A and tuberculosis, [disproportionately affected
tribal communities.]{.underline}

The Arctic stands at the forefront of our global climate crisis.
Experiencing warming at more than twice the rate of the rest of the
planet, the Arctic faces dramatic transformations as ancient ice melts,
permafrost thaws, and ecosystems undergo upheaval. These changes lead to
a cascade of challenges, from coastal erosion to shifting wildlife
habitats, threatening both natural landscapes and the communities that
depend on them. In response to these pressing challenges, [integrating
Indigenous knowledge into nature-based solutions (NbS) presents a
promising approach to enhancing climate resilience]{.underline}. [NbS is
a recently emerging term for actions to leverage the power of ecosystems
to protect people, optimize infrastructure, and ensure a stable and
biodiverse future.]{.underline} These natural (climate) solutions
include conservation efforts, habitat restoration, water resource
management, and green infrastructure initiatives.1) By harnessing
natural ecosystems, NbS can provide up to 37 percent of the mitigation
needed by 2030 to achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement and give
several benefits for climate adaptation and biodiversity enhancement.2)
Informed and well-structured [NbS can reduce climate change impacts on
local communities and counter biodiversity loss]{.underline}. However,
effective NbS are complex and difficult to design, especially in fragile
ecosystems. Therefore, **[Indigenous communities and their knowledges

Arctic.]{.underline}** [Combining NbS with Indigenous
knowledge]{.underline}, also known as traditional ecological knowledge,
[can greatly enhance the effectiveness of local climate and conservation
actions. Indigenous peoples, despite comprising only a small fraction of
the global population, manage between 13 and 20 percent of the world's
lands,]{.underline} which contain approximately 80 percent of the
remaining global biodiversity. In the Arctic, this includes communities
such as the Sámi in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Northwest Russia; the
Nenets, Khanty, Evenk, and Chukchi in Russia; the Aleut, Yupik, and
Inuit (Iñupiat) in Alaska; the Inuit (Inuvialuit) in Canada; and the
Inuit (Kalaallit) in Greenland.3) [Since Indigenous communities'
livelihoods are often directly linked to the surrounding land, northern
Indigenous groups are particularly vulnerable to climate change,

Inuit and Sámi have developed sophisticated land management systems and
ecological knowledge crucial for maintaining their ecosystems' delicate

Indigenous knowledge with NbS to address climate change impacts in the

achieving successful and sustainable outcomes.

Abstract

[Nature-based solutions ([NbS) offer a promising]{.mark} and sustainable
[approach to addressing]{.mark} multiple environmental challenges,
including **[climate change]{.mark}**, [**pollution**, and
**biod**]{.mark}**iversity** [loss]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite the
potential of NbS, their actual effectiveness in solving these challenges
remains uncertain. Therefore, this study evaluates the contribution of
NbS implemented in a nature-inclusive scenario for six environmental
challenges and associated policy targets in the Netherlands.
[[**Fifteen** different NbS were applied]{.mark} in the scenario in
**urban**, **agricultural**, **aquatic**, and **protected** nature
areas, with measures like flower field margins, green roofs,
**groundwater level management**, and river
**restoration**]{.underline}. The spatially-explicit Natural Capital
Model was used to quantify the effectiveness of all applied NbS at a
national-scale. [[Results show NbS **significantly contribute**
to]{.mark} simultaneously [solving]{.mark} all six assessed
[environmental challenges]{.mark}. The most significant impact was seen
in [**improving** the quality of **water bodies**]{.mark} (+34 %),
[making agriculture **more sustainable**]{.mark} (+24 %), and
[protecting]{.mark} and **restoring** **[biodiversity]{.mark}** (+22 %).
The contribution of NbS to address the quality of the **living
environment** (+13 %), **[climate change]{.mark}** (+10 %), [and the
**energy transition**]{.mark} was less effective (+2 %).]{.underline}
Furthermore, NbS can help to achieve sectoral policy targets at the
global, EU, and national levels, including those related to the Birds
Habitats Directives, carbon emission, and pesticide reduction targets.
This study highlights the potential of NbS to effectively address
multiple environmental challenges, although they do not provide a
complete solution, and suggests that future research could focus on
identifying even more effective ways to implement NbS, and to mainstream
their use in policy and practice.

[[An increasing number of studies indicate the **effectiveness** of NbS
in addressing **climate change**]{.mark}**,** improving the quality of
the living environment]{.underline}, and facilitating the transition to
sustainable energy production. [[Climate mitigation]{.mark}, by
**decreasing sources** and **increasing** sinks of greenhouse gases
through terrestrial [ecosystem stewardship and **improvements** in
**agriculture**, are]{.mark} widely recognized as [hav]{.mark}ing [the
**potential** to provide]{.mark} around [30 % of what is needed to keep
warming **below 2 °C**]{.mark} by 2030]{.underline} (Griscom et al.,
2017; Quéré et al., 2018). However, a more recent analysis and involving
tighter model constraints (e.g. on where ecosystem regeneration can take
place) indicates that this figure is overestimated, and emphasizes the
need to explore this potential on a national level (Griscom et al.,
2017). Our study found a lower effectiveness of climate change
mitigation at 2 %. This could be explained because the Netherlands have
CO2 emissions from organic soils far above average (Ritchie et al. 2020)
and a lower potential for carbon sequestration because of low forest
cover and limited space to increase it. Furthermore, greenhouse gas
emissions from mineral soils and reductions of other sectors were not
included in our assessment. Including these sectors would also increase
the effectiveness for climate mitigation. For the reduction of the urban
heat island effect, other studies found a 10 % increase in
forest-vegetation resulted in a decrease of about 0.83 °C in surface
temperature (Kong et al., 2014), while Steeneveld et al. (2011) reports
a 0.58 °C change. This is higher compared to our study where the effect
of a 10 % increase in vegetation result in an decrease of temperature of
0.35 °C. The lower effectivity of the results in this study could
possibly explained by differences in size and location of the cities
studied, [the type and density of vegetation, and the local climate
conditions]{.underline} (Salmond et al., 2016). [Many studies of the
effectivity of [NbS]{.mark} to [improve the **quality**]{.mark} [of the
living **environment**]{.mark} report positive effects of NbS on
[**water retention**, **air filtration**, **urban cooling**]{.mark},
[outdoor recreation and biodiversity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Results of
these studies are comparable in magnitude to our study (Gattringer et
al., 2021; Manso and Castro-Gomes, 2015; Nowak et al., 2014; Paulin et
al., 2020; Shukri, 2010), although quantitative comparisons are
difficult because of differences in indicators and the applied types and
amounts of NbS. Alves et al. (2019) report positive co-benefits for
recreational activities of increasing green space and planting trees.
[Looking at the **energy transition**, our results are fairly low, since
energy production could only be originate form **residual
forest-products**, since the rest of the **wood** is used either for
construction or **carbon sequestration**.]{.underline}

[Utilizing [research to address permafrost]{.mark} thawing

sustainability of Arctic settlement]{.underline}. However, [without
critical care, research\[ers\]]{.mark} endeavors [risk upholding

Indigenous needs, knowledge, and experiences as imperative elements to
such solution generation. Coproduction]{.mark} offers [a promising
answer to decolonizing Arctic research through embedding Indigenous
discourse within research projects]{.mark} in a comprehensive manner.
Placed within a case study on Greenlandic permafrost thaw, this paper
explores the viability of co-production as an approach to equitable
adaptation development by assessing three key components: the
contemporary methods of co-production currently utilized within
Greenlandic research, existing barriers, and its potential limitations.
This exploration was conducted through seven interviews with working
professionals based either in or outside Greenland. Participants came
from a wide set of workplaces including outreach organizations,
international research organizations, and academic institutions, which
offered personalized perceptions of co-production and varying examples
of co-productive methods used within the Greenlandic research community.
Findings suggest co-production can be a successful tool to approaching
permafrost thaw impacts in an environmentally just manner by
implementing careful consideration of Inuit culture and acknowledgement
of Greenland's colonial history. Building from these findings, I argue
co-production has the potential to support Inuit self-determination
through equitable exchanges of knowledge. Although attitudes toward
coproduction were predominately positive, certain barriers came to
light, notably research fatigue (RF), and certain logistical obstacles
when implementing co-productive research in such a remote environment.
Additionally, limitations to co-production can be inferred, notably that
discussions with Indigenous concerning permafrost impacts can be
potentially traumatic in nature, and that the promotion of effective
communication can expose gender and cultural dynamics which can
influence the legitimacy of research. While these barriers are explored,
I argue the benefits outweigh the limitations, and co-production can be
a valuable tool to approach Arctic research in an equitable and
decolonial manner.

This article explores the influence of personal values and ontological
beliefs on people's perceptions of possible abrupt changes in the
Earth's climate system and on their climate change mitigation
preferences. The authors focus on four key areas of risk perception:
concern about abrupt climate change as distinct to climate change in
general, the likelihood of abrupt climate changes, fears of abrupt
climate changes, and preferences in how to mitigate abrupt climate
changes. Using cultural theory as an interpretative framework, a
multimethodological approach was adopted in exploring these areas: 287
respondents at the University of East Anglia (UK) completed a three-part
quantitative questionnaire, with 15 returning to participate in
qualitative focus groups to discuss the issues raised in more depth.
Supporting the predictions of cultural theory, egalitarians' values and
beliefs were consistently associated with heightened perceptions of the
risks posed by abrupt climate change. Yet many believed abrupt climate
change to be capricious, irrespective of their psychometrically
attributed worldviews or "ways of life." Mitigation preferences---across
all ways of life---were consistent with the "hegemonic myth" dominating
climate policy, with many advocating conventional regulatory or
market-based approaches. Moreover, a strong fatalistic narrative emerged
from within abrupt climate change discourses, with frequent referrals to
helplessness, societal collapse, and catastrophe.

[Education](https://journals.ametsoc.org/search?q=Education)**1. Abrupt
climate change in science and society**The idea that changes in the
Earth's climate system can be abrupt is not new. This way of thinking
arguably emerged after 1963 when mathematician and meteorologist Edward
Lorenz published his famous research paper "Deterministic Nonperiodic
Flow" ([Lorenz
1963](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Lorenz1)).
His publication provided a mathematical demonstration of how small
changes in weather conditions could trigger abrupt meteorological
consequences---a demonstration of nonlinear atmospheric behavior. When
he plotted his findings in phase space they resembled the wings of a
butterfly, an iconic visualization from which the powerful "butterfly
effect" metaphor would later be derived.In 1966, three years after
Lorenz's insight into the nonlinearity of weather, the first real-world
evidence of abrupt changes in the Earth's climatic history were
unearthed in Greenland ([National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
2009](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-NOAA1)).
Analysis of the first ice cores to be drilled to bedrock challenged the
long-held belief that changes in climate occurred gradually over
thousands of years, showing past climates to have changed substantially
over centennial or even decadal time scales (e.g., [Dansgaard et al.
1969](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Dansgaard1)).
However, it was not until 1987 that this historical evidence was
formally connected to the possibility of future abrupt changes in
climate. In his 1987 *Nature* commentary "Unpleasant Surprises in the
Greenhouse?," Wallace Broecker introduced the idea that future climate
changes would largely come as sudden surprises, comparing anthropogenic
influences on climate to playing Russian roulette ([Broecker
1987](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Broecker1)).The
idea of abrupt climate change has since evolved to become as much, if
not more, of a social phenomenon than it has a scientific one. Questions
about abrupt climate change are motivated not only by scientific
curiosity, but by social, political, ethical, and cultural concerns
about their potential impacts and how to mitigate them. The possibility
of abrupt climate change therefore presents a new challenge for
decision-making, forcing humanity to explore their ontological beliefs
about the benign stability of the planet and their personal values---or
"ways of life"---in a setting simultaneously characterized by great
uncertainty and potential danger. Surprisingly, however, very little is
known about how the risks of abrupt climate change---as distinct to the
risks of climate change in general---are perceived ([Lowe et al.
2006](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Lowe1)).
In this article, we explore the influence of individual values and
beliefs on perceptions of abrupt climate change, and on their
preferences for the mitigation of such changes.Recognizing the dominant
role of values and beliefs in the social construction of risks, cultural
theory ([Douglas
1970](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Douglas1);
[Thompson et al.
1990](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson3))
has yielded valuable insights into perceptions of climate change in
general (e.g., [Leiserowitz
2005](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Leiserowitz1),
[2006](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Leiserowitz2)).
Accordingly, exploring the value of cultural theory for understanding
perceptions of abrupt climate change is not without promise, and it has
therefore been used and evaluated in this study. In doing so, we focus
on four key areas of risk perception: concern about abrupt climate
change as distinct to climate change in general; the likelihood of
abrupt climate changes; fears of abrupt climate changes; and preferences
in how to mitigate abrupt climate changes.**2. Understanding and
communicating abrupt climate change***a. The nature of nonlinearity*To
understand the scientific basis of abrupt climate change we must return
to the architect of the butterfly effect: Edward Lorenz. Upon publishing
"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow," he inadvertently became one of the
early pioneers of what is today known as "Complexity Theory;" a theory
rooted in understanding nonlinear "complex dynamical systems" such as
the Earth's climate ([Lewin
1999](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Lewin1)).
Popularized in public discourse as "Chaos Theory" by James Gleick in
1988, Complexity Theory describes such systems as complex "emergent
global structures," which arise from numerous simple interactions
between the systems component parts.Complex systems will often display
"attractors," which are particular stable states to which they are
drawn. If these systems are perturbed sufficiently, they may be knocked
into alternate "stable states." Described by mathematicians as "strange
attractors," these alternate states display internal dynamics that are
qualitatively different from those of the previous state ([Gleick
1988](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Gleick1)).
The critical threshold at which a system will inescapably fall into one
of these strange attractors is called the bifurcation point, or, as it
is now often popularly referred to in climate change discourses, **[the
"tipping point" (see [Russill and Nyssa
2009](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Russill1)).The
nonlinearity of the Earth's climate system suggests not only that
changes may be abrupt,]{.underline} but als**o that there are
significant challenges in prognosticating future system behavior (e.g.,
[Clark et al.
2002](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Clark1)).
Uncertainty continues to amass when we consider the nonlinear nature of
the potentially impacted entities, such as human society and nonhuman
ecologies. For the few who have engaged with the issue, this uncertainty
built upon uncertainty has inevitably resulted in broad and largely
speculative impact predictions, as argued by [Hulme
(2003)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Hulme1).*b.
A climate of fear*The different ways in which the uncertain science and
speculative impacts of abrupt climate changes are interpreted inevitably
extends to the ways in which they and the risks they pose are
communicated across societies. Such uncertainty is frequently deployed
in climate change debates, as an argument both for and against the
implementation of earlier and more robust mitigation and adaptation
strategies (e.g., compare [Nordhaus
2007](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Nordhaus1)
with [Splash
2007](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Spash1)).
Advocates of earlier action argue that these changes present an imminent
and dangerous threat to humanity, while opponents argue the unknowns are
too great to justify allocating resources.Uncertainty also presents
opportunities for abrupt climate change to be framed using different
linguistic repertoires to engage with different audiences and service
different purposes and agendas ([Segnit and Ereaut
2007](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Segnit1);

2009](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Nisbet1)).
In abrupt climate change discourses, one of the most popular repertoires
is that of "alarmism," which is often used in conjunction with the
catastrophe frame. With the aim of engaging people's anxiety about the
future, the system of language used within this repertoire is dominated
by apocalyptic rhetoric, comprising words such as the increasingly
popular "catastrophic."Apocalyptic rhetoric is now frequently used in
conjunction with the tipping point metaphor thereby revealing subjective
and value-laden perceptions of risk. The media, politicians, and
scientists can all adopt this stance, having used the metaphor in

"inescapable apocalypse" ([Phillips

have argued that constructing this apocalyptic vision of the future
gives rise to an implicit sense of helplessness and fatalism ([Hulme
2009a](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Hulme2);

On the other hand, others argue that the use of apocalyptic rhetoric is
not alarmist but "alarming," in the sense that it is consistent with
scientific evidence ([Risbey
2008](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Risbey1)).
Nevertheless, research has shown that efforts to induce behavior change
through fear appeals are frequently counterproductive ([O'Neill and
Nicholson-Cole
2009](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-ONeill1);

Stability and mobility*Cultural theory examines how shared values and
beliefs---cultural biases---interact with interpersonal social relations
to construct viable worldviews, or ways of life ([Douglas
1970](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Douglas1);
[Thompson et al.
1990](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson3)).
The need for congruence between cultural biases and social relations to
construct viable ways of life has led to the development of the
so-called impossibility theorem. This theorem argues that only five ways
of life fulfill this prerequisite and are labeled "hierarchism,"
"individualism," "egalitarianism," "fatalism," and "autonomy."The four
primary ways of life can be mapped upon a "grid--group" typology, which
captures an individual's involvement in social life via thetwo
dimensions of "grid" and "group" (excluding autonomy, which holds
attributes of withdrawal from social life altogether) ([Douglas
1970](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Douglas1)).
Grid denotes the extent to which an individual's life is prescribed by
social regulation, while group denotes the extent to which an
individual's life comprises social contact (see [Fig.
1](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-f01)).
These ways of life, it is argued, provide a valuable insight into why
different people and cultures perceive risks differently ([Thompson et
al.
1990](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson3)).The
stability of these ways of life is disputed among cultural theorists.
Two interpretations exist, those of "stability" and "mobility."
Proponents of stability claim that individuals seek to reproduce the
same way of life in all social contexts ([Rayner
1992](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Rayner2)).
On the other hand, proponents of mobility claim that individuals may
move between different ways of life in different contexts. Indeed, as
one critic has put it "subjects may even change their way of life during
the course of an interview or the task of filling out a questionnaire"
([Boholm
1996](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Boholm1)).*b.
The myths of nature*Cultural theory also argues that perceptions of
nature are socially constructed via the ways of life. The four primary
ways of life can be mapped onto corresponding ways of regarding nature,
known as the "myths of nature:" perverse/tolerant, benign, ephemeral, or
capricious ([Holling
1986](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Holling1);
[Thompson et al.
1990](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson3)).
Each of the myths reveals a different way of viewing the stability or
otherwise of the natural world (see [Fig.
2](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-f02)).Each
of the four primary myths of nature is a partial representation of the
reality of nature, yet to their associated ways of life they are
perceived as self-evident truths. Those who view nature and the climate
as perverse/tolerant are congruent with the hierarchist way of life
([Rayner
1991](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Rayner1)),
believing climate change to be manageable within limits. They are
therefore receptive to the idea of abrupt climate change, while seeking
a scientific understanding of its characteristics so as to better inform
that management. Characterized by the social contexts of strong social
regulation and contact, hierarchists view risks as acceptable, so long
as they are made by experts. When considering their preferences for
mitigating climate change they are therefore likely to favor expert
decision making and institutional or regulatory controls over greenhouse
gas emissions ([Thompson and Rayner
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson2)).On
the other hand, viewing climate as benign is congruent with the
individualist way of life, believing it to be forgiving toward the
exploitative activities of humanity. They are therefore relatively
unreceptive to the idea of abrupt climate change, believing that
anthropogenic perturbations of the climate system would never cause it
to become unstable. Bound by both weak social regulation and contact,
individualists see risks as an opportunity for economic gain and their
outcomes as a personal responsibility. Their preferences for mitigating
climate change therefore lie with technocentric, market-based approaches
([Thompson and Rayner
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson2)).In
contrast, those viewing [climate]{.mark} as ephemeral are congruent with
the egalitarian way of life **([Rayner
1991](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Rayner1)),**
believing it to be [very unstable.]{.mark} They are therefore [very
receptive to the idea of abrupt climate change, believing that even the
slightest perturbation might bring about a tipping point toward a far
more inhospitable world]{.mark}. [Seeing risks as imminent
catastrophes]{.mark}, they view the technocentric ideals of
individualists as the root cause of climate change, dismissing them as a
threat rather than a solution. Instead, bound by weak social regulation
but strong social contact, they advocate an ecocentric voluntary
simplicity and common effort to alleviate climate change **[([Thompson
and Rayner
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson2))]{.underline}**.Conversely,
those who view the climate as capricious are congruent with the fatalist
way of life, believing that abrupt climate changes are possible but
inherently unpredictable. Viewing solutions as a function of chance,
their preference is not to engage in mitigating climate change at all
([Thompson and Rayner
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson2)).The
two interpretations of cultural theory---stability and mobility---are
each suited to distinct types of empirical testing ([Marris et al.
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Marris1)).
Proponents of stability argue that the use of quantitative psychometric
questionnaires is a legitimate method for eliciting people's ways of
life as they seek to organize their social experiences. On the other
hand, proponents of mobility argue that such methods are prone to a
cultural self-reporting bias and do not capture the relevant dimensions
of dynamic social relations ([Gross and Rayner
1985](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Gross1)).
Advocating the idea that ways of life can change in different social
contexts, they propose that only qualitative methods can elicit the true
depth of the ways of life. So as to take into consideration both
interpretations, this research adopted a pragmatic ([Cherryholmes
1992](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Cherryholmes1)),
multimethodological approach, combining both quantitative and
qualitative methods in its design.*a. Quantitative methods*The
quantitative component of the study was deployed as an Internet-based
questionnaire using an online survey tool. Using a systematic
self-selection sampling method, invitations to complete the
questionnaire were dispatched via e-mail to students and staff at the
University of East Anglia (UK), receiving 287 responses. The
questionnaire comprised three sections: a psychometric instrument
designed to elicit ways of life within the cultural theory grid--group
typology; a series of questions designed to elicit perceptions of abrupt
climate change; and a series of sociodemographic questions to allow for
sample profiling (see [Table
1](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-t01)).**1)
Psychometric instrument**Designed to elicit ways of life within the
cultural theory grid--group typology, the psychometric instrument
deployed a modified version of the statements developed by Karl Dake in
his 1991 empirical attempt to reveal ways of life ([Dake
1991](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Dake1)).
Four statements were selected for each way of life, where respondents
were asked to reveal their level of agreement with the statements on a
four-point Likert scale ranging from 1, "strongly agree," to 4,
"strongly disagree."To attribute each respondents' way of life, four
mean scores, one for each of the biases, was calculated in accordance
with the method outlined by [Marris et al.
(1998)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Marris1).
For a particular way of life to be attributed, one of these four mean
scores was required to be below the mean for the sample and the other
three above. Using this method 23% of the sample were attributed ways of
life, comprising 47 egalitarians, 12 hierarchists, 6 individualists, and
2 fatalists. Of the remaining respondents, 3 were consistent with
autonomy, having all four scores above the sample mean, and 217 were
attributed mixed ways of life (with two or more scores below the sample
mean).To evaluate the reliability of this psychometric instrument, the
internal consistency of the statements was determined using Cronbach's
alpha. Using this test, Cronbach's alpha coefficients found to be
greater than 0.6 were considered acceptable in accordance with [Hair et
al.
(1998)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Hair1).
The individualism and egalitarianism scales had coefficients of 0.64 and
0.68, respectively, and were therefore found to be acceptable. The
hierarchy and fatalism scales, however, were found to be 0.38 and 0.57,
respectively. This is not to say these scales were ineffective, however,
as the test measured several dimensions of each way of life and as a
result the coefficients may have been deflated.**2) Questionnaire
design**To elicit perceptions of abrupt climate change, a closed
question structure was deployed in a "funnel" sequence, tackling broader
themes early with later questions becoming more focused in a logical
progression ([Oppenheim
1992](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Oppenheim1)).
The first theme provided context, examining concern about abrupt climate
change as distinct to climate change in general. Here, respondents were
asked to indicate their level of concern about each potential change on
a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1, "very concerned," to 4, "very
unconcerned." The second theme addressed perceptions of the likelihood
of eight suggested abrupt climate changes, drawn from the
policy-relevant "tipping elements" identified by [Lenton et al.
(2008)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Lenton2)
(see [Table
2](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-t02)).
Respondents were asked to indicate which of those changes they felt were
likely to occur within the next 50 years. Following on from the
likelihood of given abrupt climate changes, the third theme examined
fears of those changes. Respondents were asked to indicate which of the
changes they considered "dangerous," and which one in particular they
felt was most dangerous. The fourth and final theme explored preferences
for how to mitigate abrupt climate changes. This was operationalized by
asking respondents to select which mitigation strategies they considered
to be most appropriate for reducing the risks posed by abrupt climate
change from a list of seven mitigation options.*b. Qualitative
methods*The qualitative component of the study was developed as two
separate focus group interviews as a follow-up to the questionnaire, 10
days after its completion. Using a purposive sampling method,
invitations to attend the focus groups were dispatched to selected
questionnaire respondents who had indicated they were available to take
part. Fifteen participants were selected according to their ways of life
as determined in the questionnaire, to obtain the greatest possible
diversity of cultural representation.**1) Focus group design**Designed
to directly complement the questions in the questionnaire, the focus
group setting enabled participants to reveal their perceptions in
greater detail. Deployed in a funnel sequence, the procedure began with
a broad introductory question regarding participants' concerns about
climate change in general. This was followed by a transition question
regarding concerns about abrupt climate change specifically. With the
participants now engaged with the broad and narrowing focus of the
study, the key questions were deployed. These focused on the perceived
likelihood of abrupt climate changes occurring within the next 50 years
and their beliefs about what might happen were any of them to occur.
Perceptions of fear were then addressed by probing what participants
considered to constitute danger and catastrophe. Following these key
questions, the ending question addressed participant preferences in
mitigating abrupt climate changes.Abridged transcripts of the focus
groups were analyzed using the "framework analysis" procedure outlined
by [Krueger
(1994)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Krueger1).
Individual questions and the sessions as a whole were critically
examined for emerging themes and then coded into categories, into which
related comments were categorized. Upon categorization, the comments
were interpreted and contrasted using a custom-designed qualitative
cultural theory framework (see [Fig.
2](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-f02)).
Constructed as a "quick reference" to the defining values and beliefs of
each of the four primary ways of life, the framework facilitated an
in-depth understanding of perceptions that the focus groups were
designed to offer. These qualitative interpretations were then examined
alongside the quantitative results of the questionnaire to determine the
degree to which they complemented each others' findings and to evaluate
the coherence of cultural theory in explaining perceptions in a
multimethodological context.**5. Results and observations***a. Concern
about abrupt climate change as distinct to climate change in general*In
addressing concerns, the questionnaire revealed that the sample
population was concerned about both climate change in general and abrupt
climate change in particular. Mean Likert scores of 1.71 and 1.91 were
calculated for each concern, respectively (where the scale ranged from
1, very concerned, to 4, very unconcerned), revealing a subtle lesser
concern about abrupt climate change as distinct to climate change in
general.Within the sample population, mean scores of concern varied
noticeably between each of the four ways of life, with those displaying
an egalitarian bias consistently showing greater concerns than the
others about both climate change in general and abrupt climate change in
particular (see [Fig.
3](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-f03)).
Using a one-way multiple comparisons analysis of variance (ANOVA), these
differences were found to be statistically significant for climate
change in general (*F* = 5.237; df = 3, 63; *p* \< 0.01) where a posthoc
Scheffe comparison test revealed that the differences lay between
egalitarians and fatalists; and very significant for abrupt climate
change (*F* = 6.895; df = 3, 63; *p* \< 0.0005) where the differences
lay between egalitarians and individualists.Statistically significant,
although weak, associations between concerns and ways of life were also
found using a Pearson chi-square test of association and Cramer's V
measure of strength, proving to be very significant between the two
variables for climate change in general (*p* \< 0.001) and a significant
association for abrupt climate change (*p* \< 0.01). For climate change
in general the association was revealed by crosstabulation adjusted
residuals to be composed of an unconcerned attitude held by those
displaying an individualist bias, a very unconcerned attitude held by
those displaying a fatalist bias, and a very concerned attitude held by
those displaying an egalitarian bias. Concurrently, egalitarians
displayed a significant dissociation from the very unconcerned attitude.
Those with a hierarchist bias displayed no significant associations with
concern. For abrupt climate change the associations mirrored those of
the former, with one additional finding. Here, those displaying an
individualist bias displayed a significant dissociation with the very
concerned attitude.Providing a deeper understanding of the reasoning
behind these perceptions, the qualitative focus groups revealed a number
of emergent themes reproduced independently in each focus group. These
themes were coded under the four categories of "evidence,"
"catastrophe," "helplessness," and "justice/equity."The first
theme---evidence---related to the idea that the scientific evidence of
climate change, and in particular abrupt climate change, influenced
their concerns. Much of the discourse here centered on the uncertainties
of climate science and was framed by different participants as both a
reason to be concerned and a reason not be concerned. Support for the
former framing---concern---came from beliefs about the extent of what
could potentially happen. For example, Participant 63 remarked "I think
it's the unknown... we don't actually know the extent of what could
happen." These comments came from participants who had shown at least
some psychometrically attributed tendency toward egalitarianism and the
belief of nature as ephemeral. Conversely, support for the framing of
uncertain evidence as a reason not to be concerned came from beliefs
about unpredictability. For example, Participant 69 remarked that
"nobody really knows what's going to happen." This idea resonates with
the belief of nature as capricious and of risks as unpredictable, values
held by fatalists, including Participant 69, who was revealed to display
mixed ways of life with a tendency toward fatalism. This apparent lack
of concern supports the significant findings of an association between
fatalism and the "very unconcerned" attitude in the questionnaire.\\The
second theme---catastrophe---related to the idea that climate change,
and in particular abrupt climate change, presents considerable danger to
humanity. Discourses in this category were dominated by comments
revealing beliefs of systems and nature as ephemeral and risks as
catastrophic, values held by egalitarians. Indeed, all of the comments
in this theme were made by those who had shown at least some tendency
toward egalitarianism. For example, Participant 265 commented "for me,
it's the capacity of rapid climate change to completely wreck
civilisation as we know it." This high level of concern resonates well
with the significant associations between the very concerned attitude of
those who displayed an egalitarian bias and their dissociation with the
very unconcerned attitude found in the questionnaire.The third
theme---helplessness---was linked to the idea that climate change, and
in particular abrupt climate change, presents an insurmountable problem.
Comments made within this theme were framed predominantly by opposing
egalitarian and fatalist values. Egalitarian values returned to the
theme of evidence and framed the idea of helplessness around the
potential catastrophic consequences of abrupt climate change. These
manifested in discussion as beliefs surrounding nature as vulnerable and
risks as catastrophic, extending further support to the findings of the
questionnaire where those displaying an egalitarian bias demonstrated
heightened levels of concern. For example, Participant 220 described
rapid climate changes as "...unstable or unpredictable to the extent
that we have no way of mitigating or indeed adapting to it... ." Beliefs
about helplessness framed from a fatalistic perspective were revealed as
low levels of concern owing to their values about the unpredictability
of risks. Although supporting the fatalist findings about concern from
the questionnaire, the focus groups revealed additional participants
with fatalistic tendencies who had not been identified as having them
through the psychometric questionnaire.The fourth
theme---justice/equity---was connected with the idea that levels of
concern were influenced by perceptions of intergenerational and
intragenerational justices and equities. To illustrate, Participant 220,
who displayed an egalitarian bias, expressed concerns about the legacy
the present generation would leave for their children. Indeed, the same
participant places the blame for anthropogenic climate change on the
global "north," an egalitarian idea implicitly synonymous with the
blaming of "the system" and economic growth as the root of injustice and
inequity. These further qualitative dimensions of egalitarian values
strengthen support for the significant associations between the very
concerned attitude of those who displayed an egalitarian bias and their
dissociation with the very unconcerned attitude found in the
questionnaire.*b. The likelihood of abrupt climate changes*In addressing
perceptions of the likelihood of abrupt climate changes occurring, the
questionnaire showed that the mean frequency of how many abrupt climate
changes were considered likely to occur within the next 50 years varied
noticeably between ways of life. Those displaying an egalitarian bias
showed the highest mean frequency of changes they believed likely to
occur, followed by those displaying biases of hierarchism,
individualism, and lastly fatalism. These differences were statistically
significant (*F* = 2.916; df = 3, 63; *p* \< 0.05), though associations
between perceptions of likelihood and ways of life were found to be
statistically insignificant.\]A deeper understanding of the statistical
insignificance between frequencies of likelihood and ways of life was
unveiled in the qualitative focus groups data. Rather than beliefs about
the stability of nature, participants' perceptions appeared to be
largely governed by scientific knowledge and the media. Comments could
therefore be coded into one category of "evidence" as the main reasoning
behind perceptions of likelihood. There were, however, subtle references
revealing beliefs about the stability of the natural world. For example,
Participant 117, who displayed a hierarchist bias, commented on their
mistrust of the media and its "emotional responses to \[the likelihood
of abrupt climate change\]." This idea sits easily with the values of
hierarchists regarding a placement of trust within long-lived
institutions, such as science. Moreover, Participant 115, who displayed
an egalitarian bias, made reference to his/her beliefs of nature as
ephemeral: "even if... something wiped out the entire population and we
stop emitting any carbon I think sea ice is still doomed."*c. Fears of
abrupt climate change*In addressing fears, the questionnaire revealed
that the sample population considered the collapse of the Atlantic
thermohaline circulation---which would result in regional cooling \[see
[Lenton et al.
(2008)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Lenton2)
for an authoritative description of this and the other possible abrupt
climate changes referred to in this study\]---to be the most dangerous,
although least likely, possible abrupt climate change. Within the sample
population, the mean frequency of abrupt climate changes considered
dangerous varied noticeably between ways of life, with those displaying
an egalitarian bias perceiving the largest number of abrupt changes to
be dangerous (6.09) (see [Fig.
4](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-f04)).
These differences were statistically highly significant (*F* = 6.119; df
= 3, 63; *p* \< 0.001) and lay between egalitarians and
individualists.Highly statistically significant and strong associations
between fears and ways of life were also found (*p* \< 0.0005), composed
of a number of associations across each of the ways of life. Those
displaying a hierarchist bias showed an association with believing none
of the abrupt climate changes to be dangerous, while showing
dissociation with perceiving a large frequency to be dangerous.
Similarly, those displaying individualist and fatalist biases showed
associations with lower frequencies of changes considered to be
dangerous. Those displaying an egalitarian bias, on the other hand,
showed an association with a large frequency of changes considered to be
dangerous, while showing dissociation with perceiving lower
frequencies.The significance of the statistical associations identified
between perceptions of danger and ways of life was reflected in the
qualitative focus groups data and coded under the two categories of
"societal" and "temporal" vulnerabilities.The first theme---societal
vulnerabilities---was connected to the idea that the construction of
danger and fears thereof relate to people's perceived proximity to
experiencing abrupt climate change. Comments within this theme comprised
revealed beliefs suggesting the involvement of all the ways of life. The
first idea focused upon the relative safety of developed countries,
suggesting the placement of faith in long-lived institutions and experts
for protection. This line of thought was followed by Participant 18,
with a tendency toward hierarchism, who declared that "...in the UK or
at least in western Europe and most parts of America there's not
actually too much in the way of great danger... these are mostly
insurance and economical issues rather than real threat to life." At the
same time, comments were made about the comparably more dangerous
situation for developing countries. For instance, Participant 206, who
displayed an egalitarian bias, stated "...those low-lying states in the
Caribbean and the Maldives, they're facing serious danger from sea level
rise... they've got nowhere to go." This affinity for intragenerational
equity sits easily with the beliefs of risk as catastrophe and a call
for altruism and common effort to alleviate the danger, values held by
egalitarians.ast, one participant viewed danger not in the physical
sense but in the threat to their lifestyle, an idea reminiscent of
individualism even though this tendency was absent from the
participant's psychometrically attributed way of life. Here, Participant
237 commented that their fear lay with being "...at some point forced to
change our lifestyles... radically I think." Fatalist commentary was
also voiced with regard to the perceptions of danger. Participant 69
made reference to the dangers of societal collapse and war, resonating
with egalitarian values which, as with Participant 237, had also been
absent from the participant's psychometrically attributed way of life.
Accepting the dangers, however, Participant 69 commented also that "the
rest of it's so uncontrollable anyway... there's nothing we can do about
it."The second theme---temporal vulnerabilities---was connected to idea
that the construction of danger and fears thereof relate to people's
perceived temporal proximity to experiencing abrupt climate change.
Connections between the ways of life and perceptions of danger were more
limited in this theme, with participants largely believing abrupt
climate changes to be temporally distant. Comments made within this
theme therefore appeared to contradict the previously ascertained
beliefs about the likelihood of abrupt climate changes occurring in the
next 50 years. For example, Participant 115 commented "...it's going to
take a lot of time; it's not going to be catastrophic in my lifetime...
." Furthermore, the notion of personal temporal proximity appeared to be
an important factor in determining what participants considered to be
catastrophic. Participant 69, for example, commented that "\[the
Atlantic thermohaline circulation\] is probably going to be more instant
than the frozen methane so that's why I think that's more
catastrophic."*d. Preferences in mitigating abrupt climate change*In
addressing people's preferences for mitigating abrupt climate change,
the questionnaire revealed a statistically highly significant, though
relatively weak, association between preferences and ways of life (*p*
\< 0.001). This association was composed of an association between those
displaying an individualist bias and the options of switching to nuclear
energy and doing nothing. Those displaying a fatalist bias similarly
advocated the option of doing nothing, while those displaying an
egalitarian bias displayed the opposite tendencies, with dissociations
between themselves and switching to nuclear energy and doing nothing. No
significant association was found between those displaying a hierarchist
bias and their preferences.Concurrently, many respondents and
participants favored top-down, conventional regulatory or market-based
approaches irrespective of their apparent ways of life and corresponding
expected policy preferences ([Thompson and Rayner
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Thompson2)).
Rather, these findings are consistent with the concept of the hegemonic
myth, in that the framing of climate change mitigation around such
approaches has been "totalizing" to the point where alternate discourses
are often denied ([Rayner
1995](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Rayner3)).As
with beliefs about the stability of climate, preferences in mitigating
abrupt climate change were also widely affected by fatalism, despite
very few participants having been psychometrically attributed this
tendency. Many participants believed abrupt climate change to be beyond
mitigation. Indeed, participants perceived the phenomenon as capricious,
despite holding quite different beliefs about climate change in general.
This finding provides further evidence of an emerging fatalist discourse
surrounding abrupt climate change, confirming existing concerns (e.g.,
[Hulme
2009a](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Hulme2)).Within
the focus group discussions, several significant discourses emerged
revealing values and beliefs. The egalitarian and fatalist ways of life
found particular resonance with certain ways of framing abrupt climate
change ([Shanahan
2007](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Shanahan1))
and an affinity for certain linguistic repertoires ([Segnit and Ereaut
2007](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Segnit1)).
In concordance with their heightened sensitivity to abrupt climate
change, egalitarians engaged with the catastrophe and justice and equity
frames, confirming the suggestions of [Hulme
(2009b)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Hulme3).
Similarly, they engaged with the linguistic repertoire of alarmism.
Conversely, with their low sensitivity to abrupt climate change,
fatalists engaged with the scientific uncertainty frame. Hence, it can
be seen that the greater scientific uncertainty surrounding claims of
abrupt climate change can be easily framed to cultivate the values and
beliefs of fatalism.Of the 23% of respondents attributed a single way of
life (67), a large proportion were categorized as egalitarians (47),
suggesting that the sample may have been biased. However, larger numbers
of egalitarians have also been identified in other studies, suggesting
this is inherent to the use of Dake's statements ([Sjöberg
1997](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Sjoberg1);
[Marris et al.
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Marris1)).
Furthermore, with only 23% of the sample attributed to a single way of
life, it might be construed that ways of life are not characteristics
that can be captured by such questionnaires ([Marris et al.
1998](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Marris1)).
Indeed, some argue that the low levels of cultural attribution reflect
upon the weak explanatory power of cultural theory and thereby advocate
a diminished role for it in determining perceptions ([Boholm
1996](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Boholm1)).The
quantitative psychometric instrument of the questionnaire did not
capture many of the values and beliefs which were revealed qualitatively
in the focus groups. This is consistent with the suggestions of [Sjöberg
(2003)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml#i1948-8335-3-1-48-Sjoberg2),
where significant quantitative findings were deemed not necessarily
meaningful. Fatalist tendencies, for example, which had not been
demonstrated in the questionnaire, were consistently revealed among
participants in their discourses. This study therefore suggests that
understanding the values and beliefs recognized by cultural theory may
well be more appropriate when set in a qualitative context.The
psychometric instrument was administered a second time, immediately
after the focus groups, to assess the stability of the ways of life.
Many of the participants had, in fact, changed their ways of life since
the first completion of the questionnaire, prior to the focus groups.
This finding, in accordance with the latency of fatalistic worldviews as
discussed earlier, supports the idea of mobility in that ways of life
qualitatively change in different discursive contexts.

Over the last decades, climate variability and, more specifically,
global climate change have entered the mainstream of international
discourse, reflection and concern. One recent out- come of this global
preoccupation with climate has been a growing interest in how weather,
climate variability and climate change might be experienced, understood
and interpreted by societies and cultures around the world, including
those of indigenous peoples. In these diverse ecological, social and
cultural settings, what changes are people observing and what responses
might be the most appropriate and effective? This in turn raises the
issue of what policies and what actions are required to guide
adjustments to actual or expected future climate and its effects (IPCC,
2014: 5). To ensure that climate change decision- making recognizes and
supports local priorities and needs, it is critical to be aware of what
is already being experienced on the ground. Without this understanding,
decisions may not only fail to provide assistance to those most in need,
but may inadvertently undermine local resilience and increase
vulnerability.This volume presents a selection of case studies that
illustrate how [knowledge and practice rooted in indigenous
communities]{.mark} may [inform\[s\] our understandings of climate
change processes, and how indigenous coping strategies provide a crucial
foundation for community-based adaptation.]{.mark} It also confronts
some recurrent but misleading assertions about climate change impacts
and responses with actual accounts from indigenous com- munities around
the globe. It therefore contributes to a newly emerging field that
builds synergies among a wide range of disciplines, from both the
natural and social sciences, to address climate change assessment and
adaptation in accordance with the observations, practices, knowledge and
priorities of indigenous peoples. The Emergence of Indigenous Knowledge
in the Global Climate Change Arena. Global climate change was identified
in the 1980s as one of humanity's most daunting challenges (see early
history in UNFCCC, 1992; Maslin, 2014: 16--19). This recogni- tion led
to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) in 1988, and the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in 1992 (Earth Summit, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) that
established the United Nations Framework. Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). Since that time, world attention roused by the global climate
change debate has largely concentrated on particular areas of the planet
-- low-lying tropical islands and coastlines, high-altitude zones,
tropical forests and the polar regions (Orlove et al., 2014). It so
happens that most of these areas, except ice-covered Antarctica, are
home to indigenous peoples. Despite the world's growing interest in
indi- genous peoples and their homelands as harbingers of the impacts of
planetary climate change, [much work needs to be done to understand
their concerns and appreciate their knowledge]{.mark} (see Box 1.1).
Interest in the perspectives and knowledge of indigenous peoples (see
Box 1.2) first emerged in certain world regions and on certain themes.
In the Arctic, the Earth's northern polar region, indigenous voices were
heard loud and clear already by the year 2000, perhaps because the shift
in its climate regime has been one of the most dramatic and pronounced
on the planet (see Larsen et al., 2014). Owing to these and other
factors, polar peoples' observations and concerns about transitions
triggered by the changing climate and wea- ther were rapidly reported
and were widely circulated in scholarly and political circles (McDonald
et al., 1997; Weller et al., 1999; IISD, 2000; Huntington, 2000; Krupnik
and Jolly, 2002; Herlander and Mustonen, 2004; Nickels, 2005).In
addition, since 1996, the Arctic has a unique political body called the
Arctic Council. It includes eight Arctic nation states as its founding
members, several 'observers' (both other states and organizations) and
also six 'permanent participants' representing polar indigenous peoples
-- the Inuit, Sami, Aleut, Gwich'in, other Dene/Athabaskan groups and
indigenous nations of northern Russia. The Arctic Council has been very
active on issues related to environmental change and it has historically
welcomed indigenous peoples' interests and voices, as seen in its
seminal *Arctic Climate Impact Assessment* (ACIA, 2005) and several
other studies it initiated. The Arctic may be a rare example where a
strong consensus has developed among scientists, indigenous peoples,
politicians and local governments about the threats brought by the
changing environment *and* the need to engage polar residents in common
actions -- observation, research, assessment, adaptation and
mitigation.A similar combination of local factors favoured a more
proactive response in another area critically affected by rapid climate
change, low-lying tropical islands (Lazrus, 2012; Orlove et al., 2014).
Here the push for local people's voices and knowledge in climate change
assessment had the additional advantage of a direct state presence in
intergov- ernmental forums. Small island developing states (SIDS),
whether from the Caribbean or the Atlantic, Indian or Pacific Oceans,
are United Nations Member States and are them- selves Parties to the
UNFCCC. In the Pacific, SIDS are 'indigenous states' with majority
populations of indigenous peoples with their distinctive languages,
institutions, cultures and histories. The New York-based
intergovernmental Alliance of Small Island States also provided a
platform to mobilize shared concerns and demands. From the early 2000s,
island voices could be heard directly in global arenas and through
networks of non-governmental players, anthropological and other
scientific studies, independent environmentalists and filmmakers (see
Lazrus, 2012; Rudiak-Gould, 2013).Recognition of indigenous knowledge is
a recent development in the climate sciences in general and in the
understanding of global climate change in particular. For this reason,
it may be useful to introduce some basic concepts and definitions for
readers whose encounter with indigenous knowledge may be relatively
recent[.The term 'indigenous knowledge' makes reference to knowledge and
know-how that have been accumulated across generations and which guide
human societies in their innumerable interactions with their surrounding
environment.]{.mark} Such traditional ecological knowledge is defined
as: 'a cumulative body of knowledge, practice and belief, [evolving by
adaptive processes and handed down through generations by cultural
transmission, about the relationship of living beings]{.mark} (including
humans) with one another and with their environment' (Berkes, 2012:
7).These knowledge systems [are transmitted and renewed by each
succeeding generation. They ensure the well-being of people around the
globe by providing food security from hunting, fishing, gathering,
pastoralism or small-scale agriculture, as well as health care,
clothing, shelter and strategies for coping with environmental
fluctuations and external forces of change]{.mark} (Warren et al., 1995;
Nakashima and Roué, 2002; Sillitoe et al., 2002; Sillitoe, 2007).An
abundance of labels for this knowledge coexist in the literature. Common
terms include but are not limited to indigenous knowledge, traditional
knowledge, traditional ecological knowledge, local knowledge, farmers'
knowledge, folk knowledge and indigenous science. Although each term may
have somewhat different connotations and reference groups, they often
share sufficient meaning to be utilized interchangeably (Nakashima and
Roué, 2002). In this publication, the term indigenous knowledge will be
used most frequently, as many of the examples put forward relate to
knowledge developed and maintained by indigenous peoples. However, it
should be recalled that important sets of local knowledge of relevance
for climate change assessment and adaptation is also held by
non-indigenous rural societies (Grabherr, 2009; Lawrence, 2009).It is
also important to keep in mind that much indigenous knowledge is
gendered (Berkes, 2012). While men and women share a great deal of
knowledge, they also hold distinct knowledge sets relating to differing
and complementary roles that they may fulfil in society and in
production. Rocheleau (1991) comments that 'half or more of indigenous
ecological science has been obscured by the prevailing "invisibility" of
women, their work, their interests and especially their knowledge'.In
this publication, the term 'knowledge' is used in its broadest sense.
Though knowledge (in particular scientific knowledge) is often opposed
to practice (science vs technology) and the rational is distinguished
from the spiritual (science vs religion), in indigenous worldviews these
diverse elements are often combined. In a holistic understanding of
human interactions with their surrounding milieu, indigenous knowledge
encompasses not only empirical understandings and deductive thought, but
also community know-how, practices and technology; social organization
and institutions; and spirituality, rituals, rites and cosmologies
(Nakashima and Roué, 2002).

[As the impacts of climate change increasingly and disproportionately
affect indigenous peoples, equitable approaches to regional climate
change adaptation must center the voices, needs, and priorities of
Indigenous communities. Although the tribal climate change principles
identify actionable recommendations to address the unique needs of
Indigenous peoples in the contexts of climate change adaptation efforts
undertaken at the Federal level in the United States (U.S.), there has
yet to be exploration of how such principles might be applied at the
regional level. [Through semi-structured qualitative interviews with 18
representatives from inter-Tribal organizations and non-Tribal
organizations engaged in regional climate adaptation in the U.S. Pacific
Northwest, this research sought to describe challenges faced by, and
opportunities available to, non-Tribal entities when engaging with
Tribes on regional climate adaptation initiatives.]{.underline} All
respondents reported high levels of motivation to work with Tribes on
climate adaptation and identified several perceived benefits of
integrating Tribal partnerships and indigenous ways of knowing into
regional climate adaptation initiatives. Respondents underscored the
need for strong, trusted rela- tionships that respect the sovereignty
and priorities of Tribal nations to guide engagement. However,
non-Tribal organizations' own capacity constraints, perceived Tribal
capacity constraints, and institutional cultures rooted in colonialism
and structural racism were discussed as obstacles to meaningful
engagement. As such, we identify an urgent need to prioritize sustained
investments in both Tribal and non-Tribal actors' partnership capaci-
ties and climate change adaptation capabilities to place Indigenous
voices and needs at the forefront of regional climate change adaptation
planning and implementation.Climate change is resulting in significant
environmental changes, with cascading effects to human health and
well-being that disproportionately affect Indigenous lands and
Indigenous peoples (Status of Tribes and Climate Change Working Group
(STACCWG), 2021). Accelerated sea level rise and extreme weather events
have already precipitated the displacement and forced relocation of
entire Indigenous communities, and experts warn that this may continue
for hundreds of communities living within the borders of the United
States (Maldonado et al. 2013; Stern 2020). These impacts are
exacerbated by the effects of poverty, dispossession, and globalization
that challenge the adaptive capacities of Indigenous populations
throughout the world (Ford 2012). Moreover, given the importance of
place and connections to land that are particularly salient for many
Indigenous communi- ties, the environmental threats of a changing
climate constitute substantive threats to the wellbeing and the very
survival of Indigenous communities (Berkes 2017; Companion 2015;
Maldonado et al. 2015; Maldonado et al. 2014; Whyte 2013). As such, many
in the Indigenous climate justice movement echo warnings from leading
scientific consortia (e.g. IPCC, 2022; Reidmiller et al. 2018) and
"agree resolutely on the urgency of action to stop dangerous climate
change" (Whyte 2020:1).The intensity and the nature of climate-related
impacts in the United States are regionally specific (Reidmiller et al.
2018), varying based on natural environment (Giorgi et al. 1994;
Rasmussen et al. 2020) as well as regionally specific human activity
(Diffenbaugh et al. 2008).]{.mark} Equitable approaches to climate
change adaptation require centering the voices, needs, and priorities of
indigenous peoples. As such, tribal nations must be intentionally and
meaning- fully engaged in regional climate change adaptation
initiatives. [Despite tribally led rec- ommendations for federal actions
that address the needs of indigenous peoples in climate adaptation
(i.e., the TCCPs), sub-national actors still face substantial
organizational capacity and bureaucratic constraints to collaborating
with tribes on regional climate adaptation. **[Given regional impacts of
climate change, it is imperative that sustained investments are injected
in both tribal and sub-national non-tribal actors' (including state and
local govern- ment agencies, inter-tribal organizations, and
universities/research organizations) partner- ship capacity and
technical capabilities to ensure indigenous voices and needs are at the
forefront of localized approaches to adaptation.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

(Diffenbaugh et al. 2008). Though historically underexplored in academic
literature (Birkeland et al. 2018), cultural nuances also mediate
climate-related vulnerability and risk perception (Gautam et al. 2013;
Rühlemann and Jordan 2021; Thomas et al. 2019). For many American Indian
and Alaska Native communities in particular, the devastating effects of
climate change on cultural survival play a significant role in
determining Tribes' priorities for climate adapta- tion (Cochran et al.
2013; Maldonado et al. 2016).]{.mark}**[Recognizing the scope of the
challenges presented by climate change, organizations throughout the
world advocate for climate adaptation strategies developed through
cross- sector collaboration, government-to-government partnerships, and
collectives of multi- national non-government
organizations]{.underline}** [(National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine 2021). Dierwechter and Hale (2014:2) advocate
for strengthening regional planning processes and argue that
multi-jurisdictional planning "should be at the center of how we
ameliorate most of our major developmental challenges," including
climate action. However, the variation of regional climate change
impacts and the nuances of cultural norms and values in affected
communities also require that adaptation efforts are tailored to the
communities in which they are implemented, in order to reflect
communities' needs and priorities (Schramm et al. 2020). The breadth of
climate-related challenges, combined with the importance of nuanced
solutions, enhances the attractiveness of developing adap- tation
strategies that are tailored to fit the communities in which they are
implemented, but also robust enough to be effective (Kalafatis et al.
2015; Termeer et al. 2011).Climate adaption entails an iterative process
in which communities assess risks and vul- nerability and continually
act to reduce risk (Lempert et al. 2018). Though mitigation (e.g.,
reduction of greenhouse gases) has dominated climate policy debates for
decades, adaptation strategies have more recently become crucial for
addressing the effects of climate change (Moser 2015; Moss et al. 2013).
However]{.mark}, significant gaps remain between adapta- ion theory and
practice [(Biagini et al. 2014), as reflected in the Fourth National
Climate Assessment (Reidmiller et al. 2018), which indicates that
implementation of adaptation activities is on the rise, but "is not yet
commonplace" (Lempert et al. 2018:1310). Moreo- ver, the policy
landscape where adaptation strategies might be implemented is character-
ized by confusion about the goals that should be pursued, and by whom,
and consists of a broad range of strategies and policies (some of which
are sector- or jurisdiction-specific) that, Moser (2015:570) writes,
"reflects the fact that adaptation policy must meet many dif- ferent
demands created by already apparent or expected climate changes, which
vary across regions, sectors and time, and often also non-climatic
goals."Yet, indigenous peoples have been assessing and adapting to
climate-related risk since time immemorial.]{.mark} In [the words of a
Swinomish Indian Tribal Community member: "We've always been good at
adaptation. You look at the 500 years that the western civilizations
have been here\... And the Tribes are probably one of the best adapters
of being able to survive right along next to the western cultures"(SITC
2010:19). Traditional practices have "been sustained through previous
world-altering changes \... it stands to reason that they will again
carry the people through this changing world, too" (Donatuto et al.
2021:160). Often, the climate adaptation strategies implemented among
Tribes are rooted in traditional knowledges that prioritize "attachment
to the local environment as a unique and irreplaceable place" (Berkes
2017:11). Many Indigenous peoples and Tribal communities emphasize the
importance of first foods, for example, that have, "supported and
nourished this land's first stewards in a reciprocal relationship kept
in a harmonic balance" (Dona- tuto et al. 2021:159). Several Tribal
nations have developed and executed effective climate adaptation
strategies, including, e.g., Karuk Tribe (Norgaard 2014), Makah Tribe
(Chang 2018), Swinomish Indian Tribal Community (SITC 2010).Notably, the
accelerating urgency of Tribes' need to implement climate adaptation
strategies is largely due to human activity occurring outside of Tribal
lands and beyond the con- trol of Tribal governments. More broadly, as
described in a collaborative report on climate change and indigenous
peoples (Norton-Smith et al. 2016:3), "Indigenous vulnerability and
resilience to climate change cannot be detached from the context of
colonialism, which created both the economic conditions for
anthropogenic climate change and the social con- ditions that limit
indigenous resistance and resilience capacity." As such, **[immediate
action to redress these dilemmas is a moral imperative]{.underline}**
(Jerolleman 2019; Whyte 2013).Though collaborative efforts are often
espoused as important solutions for addressing cli- mate change, those
that link Tribal communities and non-Tribal entities require particular
attention. Relationships between Tribes and Federal government entities
are shaped by Fed- eral trust obligations to Tribes in which, "the
United States has recognized and must protect the Tribal right to
self-government, the right to exist as distinct peoples on their own
lands, as well as remaining Indian trust assets" (NCAI, 2015, p. 1). In
practice, a variety of pol- icy strategies are used to meet these
obligations. When it comes to how Federal employees should engage with
Tribes, for example, Executive Order 13,175 (Exec. Order No. 13175
(2000) articulates Federal agencies' obligations to consult and
coordinate with Tribal governments when developing policies that have
Tribal implications, and was recently reaf- firmed and extended in a
Presidential Memorandum (Memorandum 2021) that called on agencies to
strengthen existing Tribal Consultation policies. However, funding
issues and policy constraints continue to emerge as barriers for
practical progress on climate-related collaboration with, or support
for, Tribal nations (Bierbaum et al. 2013). Continued debate about how
these obligations should be realized is further complicated by the
rapidly appar- ent impacts of climate change that have displaced Tribal
communities from the land that these obligations are designed to protect
(Jessee 2020; Maldonado et al. 2013; Stern 2020).Federal policies and
initiatives that are subject to these trust obligations are often
imple-mented at regional and local levels, in Federal offices located
throughout the country (Jones 2018). Tribal nations have collaborated
with Federal agencies on a number of cli- mate-related projects in the
Pacific Northwest and throughout the United States. [These col-
laborations include, for example, direct partnerships between the Makah
tribe and the U.S. Coast Guard (McLelland and Kennard 2021), and between
the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS 2021)]{.underline}. T[here are also a number of multi-party
regional collaborations that bring together actors from a several
different enti- ties (e.g., tribal nations, universities, non-profit
organizations, and government agencies from multiple levels). The Tribal
Coastal Resilience Portfolio, developed by the North- west Climate
Resilience Collaborative, for example, is a collaboration between the
Affili- ated Tribes of Northwest Indians, University of Washington, the
Washington Sea Grant, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (Climate Impacts Group 2022).]{.underline} Similarly,
University of Oregon's Tribal Climate Change Project began as a
collaboration between the University and the U.S. Forest Service, and
now includes partners from a wide range of sectors, including multiple
levels of government, Tribal-serving organizations, and education and
advocacy organizations (University of Oregon 2022).At the regional
level, where organizations seeking to engage with Tribal nations include
Federal entities as well as state and local governments and
non-government organizations, the complexity of collaboration for
climate adaptation is further amplified. In this context, to the extent
that the number of entities who might engage with Tribes increases, so
too does the number of policies and best practices, which often vary
from State to State and agency to agency. However, despite this
complexity, and despite the importance of region- ally and culturally
nuanced adaptation solutions, less attention has been paid to regionally
specific processes for direct partnerships between tribes and non-Tribal
entities.One explanation for this may be the central **[importance of
protecting nation-to- nation relationships at the federal level that
recognize and reaffirm the sovereign nation status of federally
recognized Tribes.]{.underline}** While the National Congress of
American Indi- ans (NCAI) emphasizes this importance, they also
expressly support and encourage collaborative relationships and formal
agreements between tribal governments and state and local government
entities (NCAI, n.d.). However, collaboration at \[state\] this level is
often complicated by the fact that relationships between Tribal nations
and the State (or States) that border their lands **[are often fraught
with historical tensions, political issues, and legal battles in which
Tribal Nations seek to assert and retain sovereign rights and augment
self-determination (Hanna et al. 2011).]{.underline}**The State of
Washington's Centennial Accord (and the subsequently implemented New
Millennium Agreement) represents an attempt to codify the nature of what
a government- to-government relationship could or should look like
between a state and a tribal nation. This arrangement specifies that the
development and implementation of government-to- government policies,
and the associated accountability for doing so, are the responsibility
of each individual state agency (GOIA 1999, 1989). However, it [does not
provide guid- ance for many of the nuances that may affect
relationship-building at state and local levels,]{.underline} including,
for example, the range of barriers to this type of work reported by
Hanson et al. (2020) that include issues of trust and transparency,
unclear expectations, and institutional mismatches.Tribal perspectives
on climate-related collaboration provide insight for this research, and
are particularly useful for contextualizing the recommendations we have
developed based on this research (which appear in "Sect. 4"). The Tribal
Climate Change Principles (TCCPs) (Gruenig et al. 2015) were developed
in order to address the needs of Indigenous peoples for climate
adaptation, through advancing recommendations for federal action. These
principles are supported by many Indigenous groups, yet remain
under-utilized in practice, and fall into the following four categories:
(1) strengthen tribal sovereignty in the climate change era; (2) support
tribes facing immediate threats from climate change; (3) ensure tribal
access to climate change resources; and, (4) ensure an understanding of
when and how the use of traditional knowledge may be applied. The TCCP
report also contains recommendations for TCCP implementation, as well as
identifies inherent challenges for doing so. While the specific
recommendations contained in the TCCPs are aimed primar- ily at broad
federal processes/interactions, the core principles offer a useful
framework for understanding challenges related to supporting tribal
nations, and provide context for the process of developing and
maintaining tribal partnerships at regional levels.This research is part
of a larger tribally led project designed to develop an Indigenous model
to address climate adaptation and climate-related health issues at the
community level. Previous work on this project has developed the
Indigenous Health Indicators and Indigenous Building Resilience Against
Climate Effects (I-BRACE) model, each of which were designed and
produced by the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community to illustrate
Swinomish world views on health and to integrate such worldviews into a
climate adapta- tion approach for state and local public health
agencies. The I-BRACE model is adapted from the U.S. Centers for Disease
and Prevention climate health assessment model, BRACE (Schramm et al.
2020). It is our hope that these types of indigenous models will be
useful for informing best practices for climate adaptation among both
tribal and non-tribal entities, and that, in keeping with best practices
and recommendations about Indigenous knowledge sovereignty, they will be
incorporated into the climate adaptation work of non- tribal entities
via collaborative partnerships with the tribal nations that chose to use
them. To that end, our research is interested in exploring the kinds of
opportunities and chal- lenges that shape the actions and decisions of
those who work in non-tribal institutions, in order to better understand
the nuances of developing regional partnerships that both advance shared
climate adaptation goals and consider the unique goals, challenges,
andcapacities of tribal partners. Specifically, this study sought to
understand challenges faced and opportunities available to non-tribal
entities wishing to engage with tribes on regional climate change
adaptation initiatives, and is complementary to work such as the TCCPs
(Gruenig et al. 2015) that explores tribal perspectives on these
issues.Semi-structured interviews that inform this research leverage the
experience of key informants who work in organizations that engage in
the development or implemen- tation of climate adaptation policy, and
whose professional responsibilities include activities that serve these
policy-related goals and/or that focus on tribal engage- ment in the
U.S. Pacific Northwest. This qualitative approach allows us to explore
respondents' perceptions about policy issues, institutional goals and
priorities, and their potential tribal partners, and to capture the
richness of respondents' institu tional knowledge and experiences that
elucidate the nuances of the challenges they describe. As a result, the
findings of this research contribute an increased understand- ing of
tribal engagement processes at the regional level, and inform
recommenda- tions designed to support the key components advanced by the
TCCPs as they may be applied to the regional level.We conducted
semi-structured key informant interviews, and analyzed the information
gathered using a modified grounded theory approach that incorporates
flexible coding and thematic analysis. Using a purposive sampling
approach to iteratively select partic- ipants based on their unique
capacities to inform the research (Rubin and Rubin 2012) and to
highlight the array of knowledges that inform this study (Glaser and
Strauss 2017), we interviewed individuals who work in public and/or
non-profit agencies in the Northwest region of the United States. We
identified key informants through pro- fessional networks, and
additional participants were identified using a snowball sam- pling
approach, wherein participants recommended others who met inclusion
criteria (Becker 1963; McNamara 1994). Sampling sought to balance the
types of organiza- tions represented, including both government and
non-government organizations, and to ensure that government
organizations represented multiple levels (e.g., local, state and
federal). Similarly, sampling sought to ensure diverse professional
expertise and activities, including climate, health, and tribal
engagement. Throughout data collec- tion, we continually reassessed our
sampling strategy to target participants that could further illuminate
developing themes.**2.2 Data *collection and analysis***We recruited
participants via email, where we provided them with an overview of the
study and an invitation to participate in a video or telephone interview
at a mutually conveni- ent time. All interviews occurred during regular
business hours via video conference (e.g., Zoom). Interviews were
recorded (audio and video), and audio recordings wereprofession- ally
transcribed for data=analysis.A semi-structured interview guide was
developed a priori based on the study aim and objectives, and asked
questions clustered around three main topics: (1) climateClimatic Change
(2023) 176:27 Page 7 of 22 27change activities that respondents'
organizations currently pursue or wish to pursue (2) what tribal
engagement looks like for them, what they want it to look like, and the
bar- riers and opportunities for getting there and (3) the types of
variations in approaches to climate change adaptation that they have
observed between tribes and their own organ-izations. The interview
guide was developed/reviewed by four research team members and piloted
with the fifth member, to ensure that questions were understandable and
answerable.Transcribed interviews were coded using the main constructs
that reflect the inter- view questions, including climate change
adaptation and health-related activities and goals, the nature of tribal
partnerships, and the processes of acknowledging and inte- grating a
variety of knowledge and approaches to these topics. Initial coding
followed the logic of the first stages of Deterding and Waters' (2018)
flexible coding approach, in which descriptive index codes, developed
based on the concepts that organize the interview guide, are applied
throughout each interview. The converse of the line-by- line open coding
(e.g., in vivo coding) that often guides grounded theory approaches,
this approach is designed lytical phases were developed by summarizing
and synthesizing the main themes rep- resented by each of these six
index codes, for each individual interview. For each of these memos,
segments were summarized and then synthesized, proceeding in code order,
as enumerated above (rather than in the order in which segments appeared
in the transcript). Transcripts were annotated concurrently with the
coding process; for example, with the letters "A," "G," and "T" to
represent "Activities," "Goals," and "Challenges," or one or two words
that describe the nature of the barrier or facilitator being discussed.
Memos included thematic summaries and supporting quotations.Each memo
was sent to the respective respondent in order to check the credibility
of the synthesized data (i.e., member checking) (Lincoln & Guba 1985).
Respondents were informed that these summaries would be the basis of
ongoing analysis and were invited to offer comments or revisions. About
20% of participants provided feedback, and their revisions were
reflected in the final respondent memos.In the second main stage of
analysis, respondent memos were treated as data, fol- lowing Averill
(2002), where matrix analysis allowed for cross-case comparison of memo
segments, grouped by index code. Through this process, segments were
further reduced to a few key analytic themes in each matrix cell and
reassembled based on thematic common thematic elements across cases.
Thematic memos were developed and cross-checked with the original
interview transcript to ensure confirmability and increase the
trustworthiness of each theme (Lincoln & Guba 1985).27 Page 8 of 22
Climatic Change (2023) 176:27 **3 Results3.1 Participants *and
engagement characteristics***Eighteen of the 22 invited individuals
chose to participate in the study (response rate 81.8%). Respondents
represent 14 different agencies and organizations and have expertise
that spans climate change, environmental health, hazards mitigation, and
tribal engagement (Table 1).Respondents' characterizations of their own
occupational responsibilities for tribal engagement range from those who
have no direct or specific responsibilities in this area to those whose
primary job is to directly support tribal work and act on behalf of
tribes in non-tribal settings (Table 2). Note that these descriptions
reflect respondents' characteri- zations of their individual
responsibilities as assigned to them by their respective organi-
zations; they do not necessarily reflect respondents' beliefs about
their personal responsi- bilities, nor do they reflect overall
organizational responsibilities or constraints that may restrict working
with tribes.All respondents from non-tribal organizations indicated
interest in engaging with tribes. Many respondents explicitly
articulated their interest, and several also demonstrated their interest
by describing examples of successful partnership activities that they
have pur- sued in the past. Characteristics of tribal relationships by
organization type are described in Table 3. Respondents from federal
entities report relationships that are General lack of
relationshipsThough they have monthly meetings with local jurisdictions,
"we're doing nothing with Tribes \... but I do feel like we could be
doing more and want us to be doing more."University/research
organizationStrong relationships based on Tribally led/co-led
projectsLimited relationships, based on spe- cific funding
opportunities"We are in the process of growing our program to better
serve all communities in this area -- including for Tribes, so please
understand these efforts are still very much in the learning
phase."Large projects with multiple tribes and other non-Tribal
organizations27 Page 10 of 22 Climatic Change (2023) 176:27on tribes'
being awarded federal funding. State government entities describe
attempts to develop relationships by inviting tribes into their
organization's projects, but report that they generally lack strong
relationships with tribes. Respondents at the county level describe
strong one-to-one partnerships on specific projects with neighboring
tribes where both entities are facing the same climate-related
challenges, but that (like states) they strug- gle to develop
collaborative relationships based on their own projects. Finally,
respondents in research settings report very strong relationships with
tribes, characterized by tribally led or co-led projects that they have
the opportunity to support (with funding and/or exper- tise).
Respondents from inter-tribal organizations echo these sentiments, "For
the most part, the states are willing and would like to work with the
Tribes."Regardless of the nature or extent of engagement respondents
describe, all discuss want- ing to improve these efforts, with some
describing specific strategies or plans to do so. Respondents in federal
organizations report wanting to include a greater number of tribes in
the programs they oversee by reducing barriers for tribes to access
funds. Respondents at the state and county levels describe wanting to
improve engagement by more intentionally and systematically reaching out
to tribes and describe potential avenues to do so, such as hiring
additional staff devoted to tribal outreach, and planning future events
designed specifically to support tribes. One of these respondents also
describes the value of their professional net- works, and reports that
having tribal representatives in leadership roles has been a beneficial
avenue for developing relationships with tribes. Among researchers,
where tribal engage- ment is strong, respondents report that because
their engagement is largely in response to tribes who request support,
they are working on developing relationships with a greater number of
tribes (in order to increase the opportunities for tribes to request
support).Though respondents were not explicitly asked what motivates
them to work with tribes, some respondents from non-tribal organizations
did articulate their rationales for engaging with tribes, which included
(in descending order of frequency mentioned): (a) identifying common
best practices for addressing climate change, which might be mutually
beneficial collaborative activities; (b) getting a more complete picture
of climate-related vulnerabil- ity (at the state and federal levels, for
tribes with land in their region); and (c) coordinat- ing with neighbors
on regionally specific climate risks (which is crucial because, as one
respondent stated, "risks don't care about borders").Respondents also
describe the potential benefits of non-tribal organizations develop- ing
a better understanding of Indigenous approaches to climate change. As
one respond- ent from a state agency points out, "those Tribal
perspectives and knowledge and values can only help us, so including
them from the beginning will actually make your project stronger." A few
respondents describe their understanding of Indigenous approaches to
addressing climate change and explain that some of the most common
features of indig- enous ways of knowing are beneficial for informing
climate adaptation and environmental health strategies. For example,
some point to the principles of intergenerational equity that is often
associated with viewing climate change on a longer term basis, and a
connection to the natural environment that positions humans as stewards
of the land rather than its set- tlers. Respondents with expertise in
environmental health point out the subjectivity of the concept of
health, and praise indigenous frameworks that include cultural survival,
natu- ral surroundings and a thriving community as important components
of health. They also describe the commitment of many tribes to gathering
community input and explain that these commitments would enhance the
efforts of their own agencies to engage in "whole community health." One
respondent adds that indigenous perspectives on environmental and human
interconnectedness may be beneficial for helping non-Indigenous people
better13Climatic Change (2023) 176:27 Page 11 of 22 27 see the
interconnectedness in their own cultures, thereby helping to increase
the urgency ofaddressing climate change.**3.2 Goals and best practices
for tribal engagement**Nearly all respondents argued that the most
effective partnerships with tribes for climate change adaptation are
those based on meaningful relationships built on mutual trust and
respect. They explain that these kinds of relationships are developed
over a significant period of time, often through existing personal and
professional connections where trust has already been established.
Respondents offered several examples of strategies for pursu- ing these
kinds of relationships in a tribal context. One respondent in a
government set- ting relied on relationships with tribes that they had
developed in their previous work in the private sector. Others describe
working on small collaborative climate initiatives for the express
purpose of developing strong personal relationships. A number of
respondents also report relying on intermediaries who have more
established relationships with tribes, including tribal liaisons,
inter-tribal coalitions, and tribal leaders with whom they have already
worked (creating something of a snowball effect).\]Respondents
identified several principles and best practices viewed as crucial for
developing high-quality relationships, including communication, goal
alignment, and mutually beneficial relationships and projects. Most
respondents in non-tribal organi- zations describe these principles as
ideals to which they aspire in their work (for which inter-tribal
coalition representatives also indicated support). However, these
practices were sometimes discussed in the context of additional steps
that should be taken when working with tribes, or as a way of describing
how current/common standards are insufficient for achieving these
ideals.Many respondents from government agencies referred to the process
of Tribal Consulta- tion as a standard practice for working tribes.
Tribal Consultation, as described by respond- ents, is a legally
required process designed to encourage government agencies to consider
the impact of their work on tribes, inform tribes of that potential
impact, and invite tribes to participate or be represented in that work.
However, many respondents argued that existing Tribal Consultation
requirements are insufficient for developing the quality of
relationships that support successful collaboration with tribes. For
example, one respondent working in a state agency explains that the
"Dear Tribal Leader" letter is "kind of the checkbox that we are meeting
the statutory requirement. It definitely does not replace the
programmatic relationships and meetings and interactions. I think, for
me, that has been where most of our work has gotten done."**3.3
*Barriers* for tribal engagement**Respondents described a wide variety
of barriers for tribal engagement, which were devel- oped into the three
main analytical themes. Capacity limitations among organizations of all
types as well as tribal nations stand out as the most commonly
identified barrier to devel- oping partnerships on climate change
related initiatives. Limitations for all of these entities include
financial support and staffing, as well as other resources such as
climate expertise and professional social capital. Respondents also
described the institutional dynamics that underlie these capacity
issues, and create additional barriers, often in the form of policies
and institutional norms, that constrain respondents' abilities to
effectively engage tribes.1327 Page 12 of 22 Climatic Change (2023)
176:273.3.1 Non‐tribal organization capacity constraintsThe majority of
respondents in non-tribal organizations pointed out that they do not
have steady streams of funding dedicated to tribal engagement, and
instead must depend on ad hoccongressional appropriations and
competitive grants. They explained that without such funding, their
engagement with tribes is often limited to (1) respond- ing to tribes
who approach their offices with specific requests for support and/or (2)
developing strong relationships with only a very limited number of
tribes. A few respondents expanded on these limitations, explaining that
with finite funding and broad responsibilities "choosing to do work with
Tribes necessarily means limiting other activities."Relatedly,
respondents explained that they lack sufficient personnel for developing
strong relationships with tribes, and often must rely on a tribal
liaison (if one exists within their organization) or inter-tribal
organizations as their primary avenues for developing relationships. The
tribal liaisons who participated in this study added that, as a result
of these personnel issues, they often feel as though they are the sole
connec- tion between thousands of agency employees and all of the tribes
in their region. One of the respondents representing an inter-tribal
organization added that while they are glad to support these
relationships, it should be the responsibility of each government agency
to ensure that their employees have the necessary training and
capacities to work with tribes, so that the responsibility of
coordinating with tribes is not shifted to tribally-led organizations or
to tribes themselves.Capacity limitations of non-tribal organizations
determine not only whether engagement can happen, but also significantly
impact the quality of that engagement. As respondents explained the
importance of meaningful relationships for address- ing the effects of
climate change in front line communities, they lack the capacity to
develop the kinds of relationships that they believe to be necessary for
effective engagement or collaboration, which take time. For example,
they discussed that part- nering with tribes on climate issues requires
long-term commitments of both person- nel and resources: "We want to
make sure that every interaction is meaningful and that we are able to
commit to provide the level of relationships and assistance that is
helpful for the Tribe."Finally, respondents (especially those in federal
government roles) explained their beliefs that capacity limitations are
rooted in the failure of their organizations to pri- oritize tribal
engagement. As one tribal liaison puts it, "Agencies show their support
through funding. \...There may be initiatives going on, but it's really
through-- agencies get the work done with funding." Another participant
explains, for example, that their agency's leadership has made great
strides to prioritize working with tribes, they are still dependent on
congressional funding to move forward on any given project. With regard
to climate-related projects that could help them engage tribes, they
explain that,*Congress hasn't created any of this. The agencies are
doing what they can with the resources they have, but Congress has not
created climate change programs. They haven't said, \"Here, guys. Each
of you will set up a new division only for climate change. And here is
funding to get that work done.\" \... Leadership, I believe, really
wants to do this. But the Congressional, the legislation to support the
agencies, to open the door and the path, and give them the resources
hasn't been created.*13Climatic Change (2023) 176:27 Page 13 of 22
273.3.2 Perceived ***tribal capacity limitations***As respondents
described their attempts to engage with tribal nations, most of them
pointed to their perception of limited tribal capacities as a
significant barrier that affects respondents'decisions about what kinds
of engagement activities they pursue, and how successful they believe
those to be. Notably, both government employees and those from
tribal-serving organizations described this as a significant issue, and
it is our intention to report respondents' perceptions about and
experiences with tribal capacity limitations in the context of tribal
partnerships. More importantly, these findings are not intended to speak
for tribes about their capacity limitations, but rather to echo and
support the con- cerns that many tribal leaders and scholars have
already expressed (Bennett et al. 2014; Chino and Debruyn 2006;
Chischilly et al. 2022) They explain that the most effective climate
adaptation solutions are locally driven, and require capacities that
many tribes lack. As one respondent in a state agency describes:"Even if
state or federal programs did have more robust capacities, it's critical
for communities to have resources and staff tolead planning efforts so
solutions are tailored. In my experience, it seems like many Tribes,
similar to local govern- ments, simply don't have thecapacity to have
someone working on climate change adaptation in any formal or full-time
capacity. ***Solutions need tobe locally driven so they are tailored to
fit each community.\"***Respondents commonly described their perception
that Tribes do not have the per- sonnel capacity to respond to tribal
consultation requests from the vast number of exter- nal agencies who
contact them, nor the resources to devote to these multiple collabo-
rative projects. For example, one respondent recalls his interaction
with a tribal staff member responsible for reviewing tribal consultation
letters who told him, "I review a hundred of these in a morning, and I
maybe send one or two on to our leadership because we don't have a
subject matter expert for each of these things who is going to take this
issue on." Several respondents go on to explain their beliefs that
because of these limitations, it is especially important to value any
time the tribe is willing to invest, and some describe additional
pressure that this can create to do engagement well. In the words of one
respondent:I definitely feel at a loss for how to pursue those
relationships and how to make sure that we're bringing *value, and not
just a drain on people's time and resources, because they're
understaffed and under-resourced, and have their own things going
on.*Several respondents emphasized the importance of a broader awareness
among non- tribal entities about the effects of capacity limitations as
they create policies that affect tribes and especially as they develop
best practices with regard to tribal engagement. These respondents
pointed out that current strategies to engage with tribes (such as the
tribal consultation process described above) often fail to engage tribes
who do not have the capacity to partner, and as a result, may perpetuate
"lopsided development, where those Tribes most in need are the least
likely to get resources."Respondents also described several ways tribes
are excluded at the institutional level, and the effects of this type of
systematic exclusion on their attempts to develop effective partnerships
with tribes. Exclusion from climate-related funding was the most common
explanation given for the tribal capacity issues discussed above, and
comes in1327 Page 14 of 22 Climatic Change (2023) 176:27a variety of
forms. As one inter-tribal organization representative explained, for
exam- ple, tribes are denied access to funding "through \[insufficient\]
guidance, through cul- turally inaccessible programs, through lack of
effective communication. Access is a real problem." Other respondents
echoed these sentiments and cited exclusion climate- related funding as
a significant source of the capacity issues that hinder robust tribal
engagement on climate-related projects.Respondents working in government
roles most commonly pointed to funding opportunities that fail to
consider the needs (and the value) of tribal climate adaptation
projects. They explain that the funding guidelines on which they must
base their deci- sions lead them to reject a number of excellent climate
adaptation projects that tribes are working on. As one respondent
describes this phenomenon, "grant funding deci- sions are often times
made by staff, based on programmatic guidelines \[that need to be\]
revised to be more culturally appropriate."Another respondent who works
primarily in emergency management explained that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency mitigation grants are designed specifi- cally for
critical infrastructure projects, rather than protection or management
of natu- ral resources. Since many tribes' mitigation plans focus on
protection of the natural environment, rather than critical
infrastructure, they are excluded from this funding. In another example,
respondents in a federal government setting described emerging needs
among tribal nations, for which there simply is no existing funding
stream to support. As they explain,*I have one Tribe that I work with
that is struggling to find funding for a lift sta- tion. As the tides
are coming* in *higher, and the rivers are rising, their lift sta- tion
at their sewer system needs to be upgraded,* \$30,000. Don't have it.
*Can't find it.* That's the climate change impact. And so just even a
multimedia funding approach would be excellent \-- just to fund the
needs \[described in funding appli- cations\] *I think would allow us to
be more responsive. **We would be able to meet the Tribes where they
are, with what they're already telling us their need is.***Many
respondents working in state and federal government roles argue
exclusion from these funding mechanisms also limits opportunities for
more individual engage- ment and professional connections. They explain
that much of their work is focused on supporting jurisdictions that
apply for and receive funding from their agencies, which creates a
foundation for developing professional relationships.Researchers and
those working in non-government organizations also described issues with
funding mechanisms, which function differently but may have similar
effects. Namely, they explain that the grant-funding they rely on to
carry out their work functions within a system that privileges
settler-colonial institutions (at the expense of tribes). As such, they
argue that this type of funding often fails to honor tribal sov-
ereignty and self-determination, diminishing the quality of engagement.
For example, one researcher explains that,My work is not perfect.
*There's* still a lot of problems with the way I do my work, right? I'm
still working within existing power structures that give increased
legitimacy to *Western science, and I'm in a settler-colonial
institution, and I'm white. I mean, it's problematic still. And I'm
getting the money \-- I'm applying for grants. They're not giving the
money directly to the Tribes, usually. I mean, increasingly, that's
changing, but it's still super problematic.*13Climatic Change (2023)
176:27 Page 15 of 22 273.3.3 Institutional***constraints***Respondents
also describe a number of institutional/bureaucratic constraints that
make Tribal engagement more difficult in their own work. Several
respondents explicitly described the flexibility that researchers and
non-government organizations have(com- pared to government agencies), in
terms of the work they choose to do and how they carry it out. For
example, some of the non-government employees described the freedom that
they have to work on tribally led projects, as opposed to agency-led
projects that may seek tribal representation. They echo the sentiment of
one respondent who explained their belief that they probably have "much
more flexibility than most people in government because I'm at an
organization whose mission is to do this work and was set up to do
it."Respondents from government settings also described the constraints
of processes and tools that comprise many of the best practices and
standard operating procedures in their field (e.g., state and local
planning requirements) yet are not applicable or helpful for tribes, and
thus create barriers for effectively collaborating with and supporting
tribes. They explain that because of this relative lack of freedom, it
is more difficult for them to col- laborate with their tribal neighbors
who "often put energy into things and focus on things that non-Tribal
communities cannot \[because\] there is a certain set of things they
have to do that are defined by state law." Moreover, because these
practices are so ingrained in the way they approach climate-related
issues, they often feel as though they have little to offer tribes in
terms of non-material support such as guidance or personnel.**4
Discussion**]{.mark}In a recent essay, leading indigenous climate change
scholar, Kyle Whyte (2020, p. 1), reflects on the importance of
meaningful relationships as a cornerstone of collaborative action to
address climate change, and argues that a relational tipping point may
have already been crossed, whic[h will ultimately preclude the
possibility for achieving climate justice for some indigenous groups. As
Whyte (2020:1) writes, "the qualities of relationships connect- ing
indigenous peoples with other societies' governments, nongovernmental
organizations, and corporations are not conducive to coordinated action
that would avoid further injustice against indigenous peoples in the
process of responding to climate change."Through this qualitative
research, we provide nuanced descriptions of factors that chal- lenge
non-tribal actors from such meaningful engagement with tribes to advance
climate adaptation and address adverse health effects of climate change.
Insights from conversations confirm that meaningful collaboration with
and support for tribes may be a long way off with- out a paradigmatic
cultural shift in how climate change adaptation efforts are conceived
and prioritized. Adequate and appropriate tribal engagement in regional
climate adaptation activi- ties is precluded by non-tribal organization
capacity constraints, the effects of tribal capacity constraints, and
underlying institutional dynamics rooted in colonialism and structural
rac- ism that constrain organizations from meaningful and equitable
collaboration. However, we submit that opportunities to improve
engagement---namely through prioritizing investments in capacity among
tribal and non-tribal organizations for collaborative climate change
adap- tation, and dismantling colonial structures that prioritize
western science and approaches to adaptation---can facilitate regional
climate change adaptation collaborations that center the voices, needs,
and prioritizes of Indigenous peoples and tribal nations.1327 Page 16 of
22 Climatic Change (2023) 176:27**4.1 Initiating and *developing
engagement with tribes***Practical barriers for initiating and
developing relationships (of any kind) with tribes are evident
throughout the results described here and include limited funding for
personnel/ activities dedicated to tribal partnerships, ambiguous
policies, and unclear direction about whether and how to engage tribes,
as well as programs and funding mechanisms that fail to meet tribes'
specific needs. As a result, partnerships that may significantly enhance
sup- port for tribal nations at the greatest risk are thwarted by a lack
of capacity among regional agencies as well as exclusionary policy and
funding mechanisms that fail to consider tribes' unique needs and
priorities and thus determine which tribes they ultimately partner with.
Central to the TCCPs is the call for direct, equitable support for
tribes to address the effects of climate change (Gruenig et al. 2015).
However, developing tribal partnerships that help facilitate support
that is both direct and equitable requires efforts that are inten-
tional, rather than incidental. Doing so requires adequate staffing with
flexible funding that can meet tribal nations where they are.
Specifically, individuals in government agencies who are responsible for
doing this type of work need clear policy directives that prioritize
tribal engagement coupled with dedicated and flexible funding.**4.2
Building *high‐quality relationships***Respondents overwhelmingly
reported wanting to engage with tribal nations more effec- tively,
moving beyond statutory requirements for engagement that often view
tribal engage- ment as a static binary (i.e., measuring whether they
*did* or*did not* engage tribes). The findings above regarding the use
of letters that fulfill tribal consultation requirements are evidence of
this point. These statutory requirements are those developed in
government set- tings, often to respond to broad executive orders and
government-wide mandates that are often designed to address the unique
socio-political relationships that tribes have with sev- eral levels of
government (e.g., Exec. Order No. 13175 2000). Voicing their desires to
move beyond what is merely required of them, respondents described
several measures of quality that they aim for in their engagement
activities (e.g., aligning goals with those of their tribal partners),
as they develop meaningful relationships based on mutual trust and
respect.Ultimately, these meaningful relationships of trust are critical
to honoring the sover- eignty and self-determination of tribes as
described in the first major component of the TCCPs (Gruenig et al.
2015). These high-quality relationships may allow for more con- sistent
and thorough communication that ensures the free, prior, and informed
consent of tribal partners and enhances the likelihood that tribal
partners will be represented in spaces where climate change adaptation
decisions are being made. However, as respondents from all sectors and
organization types affirm, developing these relationships requires
signifi- cant investments of time and effort. This is in part because
tribal nations---even those in the same geographic regions---are unique
independent entities with varied histories, cul- tures, and practices.
The relationships that are developed with these tribes must therefore be
equally unique. Moreover, the unique socio-historical context of
relationships between tribes and government entities requires additional
attention and care on the part of non- tribal actors, which may not be
required for other non-tribal communities and groups. As such, in
addition to the funding and clear directives that are foundational for
developing partnerships, a cultural shift in how this work is approached
in government organizations is necessary to meaningfully encourage and
support the development of relationships with tribal partners.Climatic
Change (2023) 176:27 Page 17 of 22 27**4.3 Building *tribal capacity for
partnership***One of the most significant issues that respondents
described is their perceptions about tribal capacity being insufficient
to adequately address the effects of climate change or to devote time
and resources to climate-related partnerships with non-tribal
institutions. These perceived capacity issues are exacerbated by the
number of agencies and organiza- tions that ask tribes to engage with
them on a vast range of issues, which may be the result of statutory
requirements for tribal engagement that respondents described. These
findings demonstrate a range of underlying issues that, if not
addressed, will ultimately preclude any hope of developing climate
adaptation solutions in partnership with tribal nations. As addressed in
the TCCPs, climate change programs and resources are often inaccessible
or unavailable for tribal nations. The need to redress this issue is
exigent (Gruenig et al.2015). Our findings demonstrate the additional
effects of deeper issues that require long- term, systematic support for
capacity-building in tribal nations. Specifically, absent of the
capacity-building that takes place over generations, many tribes do not
have the personnel and resources to devote to partnerships, which, our
findings reveal, have significant bearing on how non-tribal actors
approach and engage tribal partners to develop relationships. As such,
we echo the recommendations of the TCCPs that call for equitable access
to fund- ing initiatives to provide crucial support for both immediate
and long-term climate-related issues. We also advocate for systematic
program funding that will support the continued development of tribal
personnel who can consistently serve to represent the needs and pri-
orities of their nations in collaborations that involve non-Tribal
agencies.**4.4 Tribally led climate engagement**Our findings reveal
important insights about how non-tribal agencies engage with tribes,
specifically in terms of whether and to what extent respondents (and
their organizations) are supporting tribally led projects versus seeking
tribal representation in their own ongo- ing work. The findings
presented in Table 3 reveal a potential pattern in which state agen-
cies may be more focused on seeking input from tribes on their own
projects, compared to those at the federal level, where engaging with
tribal nations is typically tied to funding mechanisms that support
tribes' adaptation solutions (notably, however, several conditions for
that support limit the eligibility of many of these tribally led
projects). As we compare the work of those in government agencies with
those working in research settings, it is apparent that the relative
freedom and flexibility that researchers enjoy in their work may lead to
more robust relationships that support initiatives that are tribally
led.As is evident throughout the TCCPs, when it comes to government
settings, each of these types of activities (ensuring meaningful
representation and supporting tribally led initiatives) are essential to
advance climate adaptation solutions that will benefit tribal nations.
However, effectively engaging in both types of activities requires each
of the foun- dational components that we have recommended thus far, as
well as significant and mean- ingful institutional changes that center
equity and justice as their core purpose.**4.5 Limitations and *future
research***This exploratory research intentionally focused on the
barriers facing non-tribal actorsand organizations when engaging with
tribes on regional initiatives for climate changeadaptation, as well as
perceived opportunities to enhance collaboration and partner- ship.
Although our findings align with and build on challenges identified in
the TCCPs, which were developed through contributions of Tribal
representatives, the TCCPs focus is on principles for federal
partnership. Future research must center the perspectives of tribal
representatives on these issues to ensure challenges and solutions
identified integrate their perspectives and align with their needs and
priorities. Additionally, while our qualitative approach, including use
of purposive sampling to include diverse per- spectives in terms of
organization type, sector, and professional role, allowed for deep
exploration of contextual nuances, our study sampling frame is
geographically con- strained to the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Given
regionally specific climate impacts Dif- fenbaugh et al. 2008), along
with divergent state and local approaches to climate adap- tation and
tribal engagement, follow-up research should seek to expound on findings
in different geographic and political contexts, both within and outside
of the United States. Moreover, this research sought to explore common
challenges faced by sub- national actors, not to identify differences
among sectors or stakeholder groups (e.g., public health or forestry).
Future research should explore differences in barriers to tribal
engagement, as well as to highlight successful strategies that have been
implemented, to promote more equitable and inclusive approaches to
climate change adaptation that can be adopted by other
sectors.]{.mark}Equitable approaches to climate change adaptation
require centering the voices, needs, and priorities of indigenous
peoples. As such, tribal nations must be intentionally and meaning-
fully engaged in regional climate change adaptation initiatives. Despite
tribally led rec- ommendations for federal actions that address the
needs of indigenous peoples in climate adaptation (i.e., the TCCPs),
sub-national actors still face substantial organizational capacity and
bureaucratic constraints to collaborating with tribes on regional
climate adaptation. **[Given regional impacts of climate change, it is
imperative that sustained investments are injected in both tribal and
sub-national non-tribal actors' (including state and local govern- ment
agencies, inter-tribal organizations, and universities/research
organizations) partner- ship capacity and technical capabilities to
ensure indigenous voices and needs are at the forefront of localized
approaches to adaptation.]{.underline}**

[This work was co-created in a spring 2022 graduate course developed and
taught by the corresponding author entitled, *Applied Indigenous
Research Methods: Considerations for Incorporating TEK into Federal
Decision-Making*. In this class, we participated in lectures, hosted by
tribal leaders and experts, presented in graduate student-led journal
clubs, and unpacked how some Indigenous communities use Indigenous
Traditional Ecological Knowledge (ITEK) in their governmental
decision-making. The goal was to produce a collaboratively written
document to share with key decision-makers at the Environmental
Protection Agency and the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy. The final product is the result of key topics chosen and written
by graduate students, aforementioned tribal leaders, and the
instructor.According to the 2020 US Census Bureau, of the 331 million
people in the USA, 9.7 million (3%) self-identify as American Indian and
Alaska Native (AIAN) under one race or in combination of up to six races
([[US Census Bureau,

The US Department of the Interior has recorded 574 current federally
recognized tribes across 48 states, including Alaska ([[US Bureau of

In addition, there are approximately 400 non-federally recognized
Indigenous communities located in various US territories, including
Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas, the Republic of
the Marshall Islands, the US Virgin Islands, the Republic of Palau, and
the Federated States of Micronesia ([[Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation \[ACHP\],

These communities include those who do not have formal
government-to-government relationships with the US Government as a
result of militarization and or policies that make them ineligible for
federal recognition ([[ACHP,
2018]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr1-11771801241235279);

US federal government has unique treaties and trust responsibilities
with each of these federally recognized tribes. In this context, tribes
are sovereign nations under the US Constitution, and through treaties,
executive orders, statutes, and court decisions. However, upholding
tribal sovereignty and treaty rights has been historically and
contemporarily challenged by bureaucratic dead ends, genocide, and
blatant disregard for these legal obligations. It was not until the
1970s, under President Richard Nixon, that federal Indian policy
declared a direct commitment to ending the Termination policy and moved
toward a policy of Self-Determination. Over the years, this commitment
has been unsteady at best and highly inconsistent across federal
agencies. While any incremental change, both legally and socially, is
not to be overlooked, federal commitments from US presidents and
Congress have had broad, sweeping implications. Without being codified
by Congress, executive orders can turnover as quickly as political
administrations. Still, these executive actions have been an important
tool to leverage opportunities for reclaiming Indigenous power at the
federal decision-making table.Since his inauguration in 2021, President
Biden has signed a series of executive orders, memoranda, and directives
that positively impact tribal nations. For example, the Biden-Harris
Plan for tribal nations outlines a new US commitment to tribal
relations. All executive departments and agencies have been directed to
review this plan and take action accordingly. In addition, as mentioned
in a November 2021 Memorandum, the Biden administration is currently
developing guidelines for its commitment to incorporating ITEK into
federal decision-making and policy processes ([[Lander & Mallory,
2021]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr33-11771801241235279)).
Also, on March 16, 2021, the administration confirmed the first Native
American, Deb Haaland, as Secretary of the Department of the Interior.
These have all been welcome changes to Indigenous communities. Still,
while the government acknowledges that ITEK is essential in making
contemporary environmental decisions, most Indigenous Peoples
understandably have concerns about collaborating with the government.
These concerns are rooted in the long-standing historical precedence of
the federal government collecting, citing, and misusing their
information. To remedy this, first and foremost, a working relationship
between tribal nations and the US Government requires acknowledgment of
the harmful and traumatic legacies witnessed by Indigenous Peoples at
the hand of these federal policies. As well, a genuine effort by the
government to repair the current material conditions endured by
Indigenous Peoples must be undertaken, combined with efforts toward
accountability, justice, and reconciliation.]{.mark}

[The USA currently faces complex, multi-layered environmental challenges
linked to hundreds of years of resource expropriation and related land
degradation. The current crisis highlights the gap in scientific
research and resource management approaches that are rooted in
experimental reductionism ([[World Health Organization,
2021]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr65-11771801241235279)).
Now that centuries-old land management strategies have brought forth
widespread global failures; a growing interest to rethink power
inequality and ways of reexamining all our relations has emerged. As a
result, many groups have begun to turn to Indigenous Peoples for their
expertise, wisdom, and knowledge as a means to curtail the unfolding
environmental catastrophes ([[Roothaan,
2019]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr42-11771801241235279)).
Tribal leaders have long advocated for ITEK to be included in US
processes and are finally gaining traction due to the urgency of the
unfolding climate crisis. However, to foster the successful and
equitable inclusion of ITEK into federal decision-making, there needs to
be active work to disrupt well-established colonial dynamics and offer
space for transformative and restorative work where Indigenous voices
are at the forefront ([[Gagnon-Bouchard & Ranger,
2020]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/11771801241235279#bibr16-11771801241235279)).
To address these challenges, an interdisciplinary approach that
effectively and respectfully embeds knowledge plurality into the process
will need to be considered. In the context of Indigenous Peoples in the
USA, this will require a deep understanding of the history of tribal
nations and the genocide and epistemicide endured at the hands of US
Government policies and citizens.In this work, we seek to discuss both
the importance of moving toward ITEK, given the severe state of
imbalance that the natural world is in, and the ethical considerations
needed to approach Indigenous Peoples and ITEK with proper care,
respect, and integrity. In short, though ITEK is a vital part of land
restoration and rehabilitation, the authors advise the US Government to
first center Indigenous Peoples and their sovereignty in efforts to
integrate ITEK into federal policy. Following these recommendations is
imperative to the success of ITEK implementation in federal policy
because Indigenous systems of knowledge are embedded in Indigenous
relationships with the land and other non-human beings, that is, ITEK,
Indigenous Peoples, and the land are inextricably linked. Further,
preserving and strengthening ITEK, while maintaining and increasing
Indigenous sovereignty, can begin a process of justice, accountability,
and reconciliation.]{.mark}

[[Traces of history animate modern Arctic]{.mark} affairs and
landscapes.]{.underline} Cournoyea shared the intersections of her own
family with a genealogy of knowledge. Her grandfather, Mike Siberia,
worked as a technician on a governmental survey of resources in the
Yukon and Northwest Territories, the Canadian Arctic Expedition of
1913--­ 18. He married an Inuit woman who served as a seamstress for the
scientists, sewing clothes from caribou so they could collect samples
without succumbing to the cold. It was this expedition that gave
Canadian officials the impetus for the reindeer project. Like
scientists, members of Inuit communities played different roles over the
episodes of intervention I examine. In the late 1800s, most were hunting
guides. By the 1970s, many testified before public hearings on oil and
gas development---like Cournoyea herself. [This lineage shows that
nothing in the Arctic is "pure"---­ not bloodlines, land, history, or
science.]{.underline} I place the Arctic in time not to establish what
belongs there, but to discern movements[. [Colonialism was, and
continues to be, a tangle of intentional interference and its unintended
consequences.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Cournoyea's testimony evinces,
looking at a corner of the region, and keeping it in focus over the long
view, helps apprehend both the course of history and the undercurrents
of interruption---­ however fugitive or profound. Displacements in and
from the Arctic, then, are part of the picture of global change I want
to depict.19 [[For most of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
Inuit avoided outsider's attempts to control Arctic nature.]{.mark} They
relied on knowledge and experience to live off abundant natural
resources, including whales, seals, caribou, fish, and an array of
plants. They also tapped into economies of exchange operating beyond
governmental jurisdiction---­ whether through independent whaling or
trading companies or fellow indigenous groups. Their lives, like those
in the nonhuman world, hinged on mobilit]{.underline}y. By the mid-­
1950s, Cournoyea noted, Inuvialuit were stuck. They could no longer rely
on the productivity of the land or the fur economies built upon it. [[At
the same time, governmental scientists ceased to involve them. Many
researchers no longer saw the value of local]{.mark} guide[s]{.mark} [if
they could complete an entire survey by plane while on the hunt for oil
resources that played little part in indigenous society. Inuit]{.mark}
stewed over these developments and [began voicing their
frustration]{.mark}---­ to scientists. The means of [Inuit
resilience]{.mark} by the 1960s, then, [was not avoiding science, but
appropriating it as a tool in political organization.]{.mark} Inuit
allied with a group of concerned scientists---­ particularly those with
environmentalist leanings---­ in their fight for sovereignty in Arctic
Alaska in 1971 and on the Canadian side of the western Arctic between
1977 and 1984. In other words, [as the military-industrial complex
turned northward, and Arctic administrators granted scientists their
highest levels of financial support and decision-making authority, a
reconfiguration of science and power was set in
motion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrary to analyses of colonialism in the
Global South, then, the end of my story is not the end of Arctic
science. Rather, a century of intervention came to a close by
articulating a science that was both humanist and environmental---­ and
situating it carefully within civil society. When Inuit inked land
claims agreements with the United States and Canada in the 1970s and
1980s, there was the fanfare of a revolution. But there was also a more
subtle evolution, one predicated on the supervision of science and
regular monitoring of the physical environment. I thus steer clear of
"decolonization" as a reference to the period in which land claims were
negotiated and formalized, since it implies a withdrawal of colonial
forces. I use instead "postcolonial" to denote all of the years after
1881 as characterized by the legacies of the continued colonial
encounter, with attention to the structures through which land was used,
studied, and managed. These analytical choices affect more than
disciplinary terrain. They comprise a way of being in the world that
treats the past as constitutive of the present.20 [[In the]{.mark}
19[70s and]{.mark} 19[80s, both federal and Inuit governments emphasized
the reorganization of knowledge production through more participatory
and democratic decision making, informed consent procedures, and
research licensing.]{.mark} Through these processes, [Inuit shaped
research agendas, resource development projects, and political discourse
on environmental dilemmas at]{.mark} both [the]{.mark} national and
[international levels. In all of these instances, Inuit forged closer---­
but no less contentious---­ relations with
scientists]{.mark}.]{.underline}21 It may be no surprise then, that
Cournoyea closed her presentation before the Inuit Studies Conference by
courting academics, cautiously. She expressed to members of the
audience---­ many of them anthropologists, geographers, and ecologists---­
the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation's interests in collaborating on
studies of sea ice and Arctic warming.

UNFREEZING THE ARCTIC

As the auditorium emptied, and conference-­ goers began to queue by the
trays of cherry danishes, I introduced myself to the person in the aisle
be- hind me. The requisite exchange of hellos and credentials ensued.
But something in my introduction caught my new colleague off guard. "A
historian?" he remarked, kinking his head. "What are you doing here?" In
terms of academic standing, Arctic climate change is the domain of the
natural and social sciences. It is not immediately obvious, to at least
some of these scholars, what history offers to the study of
environmental problems. The study of the past may seem like a hobby, a
luxury in a bygone age of planetary stability. And, to be fair, many
historians choose not to intervene in contemporary debates, even if
their scholarship bears directly on present conditions.22 For those
Arctic scholars in disciplines outside of history, this book provides a
backstory for climate change and globalization. The Arctic has been
central to the development of scientific knowledge since the middle of
the 1800s, just as scientists have been central to developments in the
Arctic over the same period. And, while melting ice is out of the
ordinary, it is also nothing new: it is the latest in a string of rapid
environmental transformations in the region over the last 150 years.
When we take seriously these aspects of the Arctic's past, rising
temperatures and shifting global power dynamics become more than
ecological or social problems. They become matters of history as well.23
Quite literally, previous episodes of scientific exploration and
exploitation permeate northern societies and landscapes. [[Current
frameworks of governance and knowledge-making in the Arctic are]{.mark}
also [products of the colonial experience]{.mark}, established through
acts of Congress and modern treaties.]{.underline} If, in promoting
ambitious plans for adaptation in the Arctic, this his- tory is
concealed, social and natural scientists may repeat it without realizing
it. [Geographer Emilie Cameron has convincingly shown that [such
politics are at play in climate science today, specifically in the
literature on **vulnerability and adaptation**.]{.mark}
[Scientists]{.mark} in these fields often [frame Inuit]{.mark}
ecological [knowledge]{.mark} and existing natural resource management
regimes [as inapplicable to]{.mark} physical conditions spawned by
[climate change. As a result, Inuit lose standing in channels of Arctic
decision making.]{.mark} Natural scientists and social [scientists can
prevent this situation by]{.mark} examining circumpolar phenomena in the
context of a history of colonialism there, and [remaining committed to
the principles of]{.mark} modern treaties and [participatory
democracy]{.mark}---­ like fair representation, informed consent, and
self-­ determination.]{.underline}24 For my colleagues in history---­ and
especially environmental history and the history of science---­ I intend
these pages as a call to arms. We should engage more fully in current
affairs, as public intellectuals with valuable and relevant expertise.
As historians Mark Carey and Nancy Langston have argued for the issue of
climate change, historians have an ability---­ and duty---­ to reframe
environmental crisis in human terms. Circumpolar indigenous peoples have
taken the lead on this, reminding world power brokers that climate
change is not a problem of atmospheric chemistry---­ it is a human rights
issue.25 We historians with interests in Arctic and polar regions must
complement this narrative by helping our colleagues in the natural and
social sciences confront the colonial legacies of their disciplines. We
must also challenge the pervasive misconceptions about the Arctic held
in the communities we call home, misconceptions that, despite their
deconstruction in the scholarly literature, continue to produce
troubling political and material effects in the north. This kind of
publicly engaged history is not meant to discredit scientists, or reject
science in meeting environmental challenges. Rather, it reorients our
discussions from the sites where warming is most obvious to the places
and processes that drive climate change and globalization. In these ways
and for these reasons, historians should intervene in civil discourse.26
The architecture of the narrative herein reflects this call to arms.
Each chapter presents a case study of an environmental transformation in
the western Arctic and its associated interventions. Taken together,
they constitute a history of northern colonialism from 1881 to 1984. The
chronology does not tally with standard narratives of the region, or
even the neat numbers of the Roman calendar, but with the intersecting
paths of North American politics, global economic history, Inuit
accounts of the past, and science's internal development (disciplinary
breakthroughs, for example). To foreground science as a prism onto all
of these processes, I organize the chapters according to ideas that
guided human interactions with nature at the time: dangerous,
threatened, wild, strategic, and disturbed. Readers may find some of
these terms anachronistic, unfairly confined to a period of years, or
similar to the ways scientists imagine other "last frontiers" in
Antarctica, Oceania, or the Amazon basin.27 I welcome these reactions as
part of continuing discussions of history and global change. The
individual cases I present do not so much replace one another as
entangle with each other, leaving today's landscape as the sum total of
the past. This analytical and organizational approach stays honest to
the historical records I have consulted, but it does something else
equally as important. It underlines the historian's roles as interpreter
and public scholar. That is, historians turn to the past not to discover
what happened, but to make sense out of the world in which we now live.
[As historian Howard Zinn observed, humans inflict pain on each other
and the planet they share because they bury social atrocities "in a mass
of other facts, as radioactive wastes are buried in containers in the
earth]{.underline}."28 [[The Arctic's colonial legacies are being
buried, unwittingly, by a surge of popular and scientific media.]{.mark}
Unfreezing the Arctic means that, as the circumpolar basin warms, [we
must dissolve notions of the place as frozen in time. It means
confronting the long colonial life of an environment imagined as
unspoiled, remote, or simply local]{.mark}---­ [so that we can reach a
more sophisticated understanding of climate change and
globalization.]{.mark} It means releasing his- tory from the past,
showing how it matters now for all those contemplating the
future.]{.underline}

It's no secret that climate change is wreaking havoc on some of the
world's largest cities. But less reported are its effects on more rural
areas and the Indigenous peoples who live there. After living on their
respective territories for millennia, [Indigenous communities are
experiencing unprecedented environmental changes that are forcing them
to shift how they live and work on the land]{.underline}. Gleb
Raygorodetsky, who was born and raised in a small village on the Bering
Sea coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, USSR, helps to bring greater attention
to climate change's impact on Indigenous peoples in his new book, The
Archipelago of Hope: Wisdom and Resilience from the Edge of Climate
Change, out now on Pegasus Books. Affecting and beautifully researched,
the book made it onto Library Journals list of "Best Sci-Tech Books of
2017." I spoke with Raygorodetsky about his research, the knowledge that
climate scientists might gain if they better listened to Indigenous
peoples, and what the rest of us can do to combat climate change and
support the activism coming out of Indigenous communities. Amy Brady:
The Archipelago of Hope has little to do with actual archipelagos. Gleb
Raygorodetsky: I was fortunate to work for a few years as a Program
Officer for The Christensen Fund, a private foundation based out of
California that focuses its grantmaking on supporting "stewards of
biocultural diversity[." One of the key lessons I took away from that
project was that the source of global resilience lies within the
Indigenous traditional territories, which support about 80 percent of
the world's biological diversity and contain close to a quarter of the
carbon stored above ground in the world's tropical forests (not
including the carbon stored in the soil).]{.underline} The Archipelago
of Hope is my attempt at conveying the fundamental role that Indigenous
territories have in determining the future of humankind and our planet.
Amy Brady: You tell in your book a story about how you became acquainted
with Indigenous cultures and the concept of Traditional Ecological
Knowledge, the environmental knowledge that Indigenous peoples developed
after thousands of years of working and living in their territories.
What inspired you to start thinking of these communities in terms of
climate change? Gleb Raygorodetsky: It has not emerged out of some naïve
vision of Indigenous peoples as "noble savages" or a romantic belief
that somehow we must all be magicked back into the "ancestral ways" to
solve our current problems. On the contrary, what has motivated me all
these years is quite rational and pragmatic. In two decades of scholarly
and community-based learning, observation, and participation, I have
come to realize that [[it is the Indigenous peoples who are the true
stewards of global biocultural heritage]{.mark}. After all, it is they
who have a robust millennia-long track record of maintaining intimate
relationships with the natural world, which has nourished their
communities and sustained their cultures, without devouring the
life-giving environment.]{.underline} This is the track record that they
continuously strive to maintain, despite formidable odds, including
fierce opposition from the "developed" world. The "accomplishments" of
modern society, however, are a lot more recent, paltry, and have had
much more destructive consequences for life on Earth. The most efficient
path toward enhancing climate change resilience is to secure and support
Indigenous peoples' rights to their lands and waters, so that they can
continue to support the majority of Earth's remaining biological and
cultural diversity. Amy Brady: What do you think climate scientists
would learn if they better listened -- perhaps even partnered with --
members of Indigenous communities? Gleb Raygorodetsky: [[There is a
growing body of evidence in scientific and policy-making communities
that show]{.mark} that to maintain resilience in the face of change, [we
must draw on]{.mark} the best available knowledge, regardless of its
epistemological origins -- whether it is Traditional Ecological
[Knowledge rooted in millennia of meticulous on-the-land
observations]{.mark} of seasonal animal behavior [or contemporary
scientific methodologies that rely on satellites to remotely capture
large-scale changes]{.mark}. [The process of interweaving]{.mark}
different [knowledge systems creates opportunities]{.mark} for
developing a deeper understanding of observed events and their
consequences, facilitates joint assessment of information, [and leads to
new insights and innovations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Amy Brady: What will
it take for scientific communities to take Traditional Ecological
Knowledge seriously? Gleb Raygorodetsky: As I learned from the Skolts,
[synergies between traditional knowledge and conventional science have
helped them maintain resilience in the face of climate
change.]{.underline} Traditional knowledge enables the Skolt Sämi to
monitor and respond directly to the changes they observe in the status
of Atlantic salmon with greater expediency and efficiency than existing
government programs. At the same time, the Skolts collaborate with
scientists on other aspects of environmental monitoring that are outside
of their own areas of expertise, such as changes in the marine portion
of the salmon life-cycle. [But this process of co-producing knowledge
works well only when the rights of Indigenous peoples to make decisions
about land use are acknowledged and respected,]{.underline} as required
by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) that
has been endorsed by 148 countries, including the United States and
Canada. Recognizing the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples to be
stewards of their lands and waters is key if their traditional
territories are to continue to play an important role in biodiversity
conservation and climate regulation. Amy Brady: What surprised you the
most during your research for this book? [Gleb [Raygorodetsky]{.mark}: I
[learned a lot and continue to learn daily from work with Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}.]{.underline} One of the main revelations for me was
that, despite everything they have endured at the hands of the
"developed world," they are still forgiving, generous, and patient with
us. Another eye-opener for me was that there is no sense of doom and
gloom. Despite dire circumstances, they maintain hope for the future.
Amy Brady: What can people who are not Indigenous -- but who care deeply
about how we're treating the planet and these people -- do to support
Indigenous cultures and the activism coming out of their communities?
Gleb Raygorodetsky: Many things. In Canada, the Truth & Reconciliation
Commission developed a number of recommendations to help guide and
inspire Aboriginal peoples and Canadians in a "process of renewed
relationships that are based on mutual understanding and respect." And
based on my own experience I've tried to capture some ideas in what I
call the "Pledge of a Good Ally." Amy Brady: What's next for you? Gleb
Raygorodetsky: I just started a new job as an Executive Director of the
Indigenous Knowledge, Community Monitoring and Citizen Science (IKCMCS)
branch of Alberta Environment and Parks here in Canada. It is extremely
heartening to see the Alberta Government champion the critical and
challenging issue of respectful knowledge co-creation based on the
synergies between Traditional Ecological Knowledge and conventional
science. It is an honor and a privilege to contribute over two decades
of learning, practice, and leadership experience to the evolution of
this important initiative. In terms of writing, I'm working on Bardo, a
YA novel I've been writing on and off for the last couple of years. I'm
trying to explore in it similar issues I write about in The Archipelago
of Hope.

In the Arctic, where rapid environmental changes [challenge existing
governance and adaptation strategies, **co-production of knowledge
([CPK]{.mark}) has [emerged as a]{.mark} crucial [method]{.mark} for
[making use]{.mark} of [diverse knowledge systems]{.mark} to [inform
decision-making processes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} [app**roach [fosters collaboration between
Indigenous Knowledge Holders and scientist]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}, ensuring
that Arctic research and policy are informed by the most comprehensive
and contextually relevant insights.]{.underline} The Saami Council is
applying co-production methods to ensure effective participation and
effectiveness in knowledge production to inform recommendations in areas
such as climate change adaptation, biodiversity management, and
sustainable land use.

[**[C]{.mark}o-[p]{.mark}roduction of [k]{.mark}nowledge** is a
[collaborative process]{.mark} that [involves]{.mark} the [integration
of different knowledge systems]{.mark}, [values]{.mark} and [practices
to]{.mark} [address complex socio-ecological
challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to the framework outlined in
recent research[**, co-production of knowledge is [more than]{.mark}**
just an [exchange of info]{.mark}rmation; **[it's a dynamic,
iterative]{.mark} and [context-dependent process]{.mark} [where
Indigenous Knowledge Holders and]{.mark} [scientists work together to
create new, actionable knowledge]{.mark}**. Effective
[c]{.mark}o-[p]{.mark}roduction of [k]{.mark}nowledge [requires
equitable partnerships]{.mark}, [trust-building]{.mark} and [sustained
engagement]{.mark}, [ensuring]{.mark} that [diverse perspectives]{.mark}
are [not only acknowledged]{.mark} but [also meaningfully
incorporated]{.mark} [in]{.mark}to
[decision-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} A key aspect of this approach is
[recognizing power dynamics and [fostering inclusive
participation]{.mark}, [where Indigenous Knowledge systems]{.mark} are
[valued alongside scientific methods]{.mark} in shaping research
questions, data interpretation and policy recommendations]{.underline}.
This also includes [[ensuring ethical research practices that respect
Indigenous]{.mark} data [sovereignty]{.mark}, [fostering long-term
partnerships]{.mark} based on trust, and supporting
capacity-building]{.underline}.

Case Study: Climate Impacts on Terrestrial Environments (CITE)

Recognizing the rapid warming of the Arctic and its impact on
biodiversity, the Climate Impacts on Terrestrial Environments (CITE)
project, initiated by the Saami Council and the Arctic Monitoring and
Assessment Programme (AMAP), [[represents an important effort]{.mark} in
the [c]{.mark}o-[p]{.mark}roduction of [k]{.mark}nowledge. Funded by the
Nordic Council of Ministers, [CITE bridges Sámi reindeer herders\'
knowledge with scientific research to assess]{.mark} the [effects of
climate change]{.mark} on [terrestrial ecosystems in
Sápmi]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[project focuses on combining Indigenous Knowledge and scientific
research]{.mark} to [support climate adaptation]{.mark} and sustainable
management of terrestrial ecosystems. [Through]{.mark} the
[dev]{.mark}elopment [of]{.mark} a [digital platform]{.mark}, CITE
Maptionnaire, which is the [result of collaboration between reindeer
herders and researchers]{.mark}]{.underline}, it [facilitates]{.mark}
the [[systematic documentation]{.mark} of [reindeer herders\'
observations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [platform allows herders to map
seasonal changes in snow conditions, vegetation and landscape
transformations. Competing land use is also documented, providing a
comprehensive view of environmental changes affecting reindeer
herding.]{.underline} This [[data is then used to enhance climate
models]{.mark} to improve climate and weather data for reindeer herders,
and also to foster a broader understanding within society of the
challenges they face.]{.underline}

A key feature of the project was [its [emphasis on Sámi-led research
design]{.mark}. [Sámi herders played a central role]{.mark} in [defining
research questions]{.mark}, [ensuring that the study addressed]{.mark}
their [lived experiences]{.mark}. Participatory workshops facilitated
collaboration between herders and scientists, fostering trust and mutual
learning.]{.underline}

The [[project also underscored]{.mark} the [importance of
language]{.mark} in knowledge production. Sámi languages contain precise
terminology for snow and ice conditions, which are critical for reindeer
herding.]{.underline} To bridge linguistic gaps, [the [project
prioritized multilingual communication, allowing herders to share
observations in their native language.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Challenges included]{.mark} the need for [flexible timelines]{.mark}
to [accommodate herders']{.mark} seasonal activities and addressing
concerns regarding data ownership.]{.underline} The [[project
established clear agreements]{.mark} to [ensure]{.mark} that [Indigenous
Knowledge]{.mark} [remained]{.mark} [under the control of the Sámi
communities,]{.mark} reinforcing ethical knowledge
stewardship.]{.underline}

The [[CITE initiative has provided invaluable insights into]{.mark} the
[effectiveness]{.mark} of [co-production methodologies]{.mark}. [By
including]{.mark} [I]{.mark}ndigenous [K]{.mark}nowledge [in]{.mark}
[scientific monitoring]{.mark}, the [project has]{.mark}
[enhanced]{.mark} [climate adaptation strategies]{.mark} [for Sámi
herders]{.mark} and [informed broader environmental policies]{.mark}
[within]{.mark} the [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil
framework]{.underline}.
A [storymap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b7f8e949186f430f96fe569664b0532d) is
one of the tangible outcomes from the CITE project.

### 2AC \-\-- AT: Cooperation Now

#### The federal government has attempted to include indigenous communities into policy action but without considering their knowledge and a distinct focus on relocation.

realized, [are ongoing policy concerns]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In November, which was Native American Heritage Month[, **[federal

**[highlighted]{.mark} [opportunities]{.mark} to [improve cooperation
between]{.mark} [tribal nations]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [federal

The [**[House Select Committee]{.mark}** on the Climate Crisis **[held a
hearing]{.mark}** on November 18 called **Tribal Voices, Tribal Wisdom,
Strategies for the Climate Crisis** **[to discuss key climate
issues]{.mark} [and solutions for tribes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
Biden-Harris Administration also hosted the [White House Tribal Nations
Summit](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/15/fact-sheet-building-a-new-era-of-nation-to-nation-engagement/) earlier
that week, **[which included a \"Climate Change Impacts and Solutions\"
panel. An]{.underline}** article covering that panel can be
found [**[here]{.underline}**](https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/white-house-tribal-nations-summit-features-new-initiatives-opportunities-for-climate-action).
**Funding Access and Technical Assistance** During the Select Committee
hearing, witnesses praised the recently passed Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58)---which includes approximately \$15 billion
for tribe-specific funding across issue areas---but also described
obstacles to accessing federal funds more broadly, including a lack of
technical assistance. Large-scale renewable energy projects, in
particular, can take a tremendous amount of time and staff power for
environmental impact reviews and market analysis. More complicated
incentive structures, such as tax credits, require even more
institutional knowledge that can be difficult for tribes to access.
"With plummeting costs of \[renewable energy\] technologies, federal
support---such as technical and financial assistance---can be more
impactful and more meaningful," Pilar Thomas, former deputy director for
the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs at the U.S. Department
of Energy, observed. Mu**l**tiple witnesses also noted that processes to
receive funding should be directly between tribes and federal
agencies**.** Projects on tribal lands often have to go through state
governments to apply for and receive federal funding, increasing the
amount of development work for tribal governments[.]{.underline}

  **Holistic Climate Action and Tribal Consultation**

[**Climate funding also tends to be technology-, species-, or
place-specific, which makes it difficult for tribes to address climate
change across sectors, ecosystems, and communities**.]{.underline}

[In order to meet climate concerns more holistically, tribes must patch
together the various funding opportunities between nine agencies and 75
federal programs, which can be a daunting task. [Speakers urged
cross-agency coordination on climate funding activities in consultation
with tribes.]{.mark}]{.underline} "The big opportunity for the
administration is how do we better coordinate amongst ourselves," said
Thomas. "Part of that really should start with asking the tribes who are
trying to develop projects, 'What do you need from us? And what can we
do from the federal government perspective to support that effort?'"

[**[Tribal consultation is]{.mark} especially [critical in matters
concerning relocation]{.mark} or climate migration[. The Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act includes \$130 million for tribal community
relocation projects]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet, Fawn Sharp,
the president of the National Congress of American Indians and vice
president of the Quinault Indian Nation, noted that the federal
government has not yet established a program or framework for
relocation. Sharp urged Congressional legislators to "promote the need
for full and meaningful consultation on the development of a Tribal
Community Relocation Program at Department of the Interior (DOI) to
ensure tribal priorities on relocation funding are identified and the
priorities are incorporated into the program's implementation process."

Indigenous populations have been identified as vulnerable to climate
change. This framing, however, is detached from the diverse geographies
of how people experience, understand, and respond to climate-related
health outcomes, and overlooks nonclimatic determinants. I reviewed
research on indigenous health and climate change to capture place-based
dimensions of vulnerability and broader determining factors. Studies
focused primarily on Australia and the Arctic, and indicated significant
adaptive capacity, with active responses to climate-related health
risks. However, nonclimatic stresses including poverty, land
dispossession, globalization, and associated sociocultural transitions
challenge this adaptability. Addressing geographic gaps in existing
studies alongside greater focus on indigenous conceptualizations on and
approaches to health, examination of global--local interactions shaping
local vulnerability, enhanced surveillance, and an evaluation of policy
support opportunities are key foci for future research.The global
climate is changing and will continue to
change.[^[1,2]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

and indicates significant
vulnerabilities.[^[3]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Key risks include increasing exposure to infectious diseases,
exacerbated water and food insecurity, natural disasters, and population
displacement, detailed descriptions of which are provided
elsewhere.[^[3,4]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Populations will be differentially vulnerable to these potential impacts
at global to local levels. Those at highest risk include populations
with an existing high burden of ill health, who are sensitive to
climate-related health risks, and live in nations with limited
technological capacity, weak institutions, high levels of poverty, and
political
inequality.[^[5]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)Indigenous
populations have been identified as a highly vulnerable group within
global discourse on climate change because of habitation in regions
undergoing rapid change, and the disproportionate burden of morbidity
and mortality faced by many groups. Yet our understanding of the human
dimensions of climate change for indigenous populations at a global
level is limited. Ford et
al.,[^[6]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
for instance, noted how indigenous-focused content has been largely
overlooked in assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), other major
assessments,[^[3,7,8]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
and in policy discussions surrounding the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Where indigenous issues are
captured, indigenous ways of understanding and information about
climate--society interactions embedded in myths, stories, tradition, and
observations have typically been marginalized. This forms part of what

described as the civic epistemology of global climate change discourse
that prioritizes positivist disciplines at the expense of the
interpretative, creating knowledge detached from its local context. As a
consequence, indigenous peoples are often viewed as powerless victims of
climate change, overlooking how social, cultural, and economic
conditions determine how climate change is experienced, understood, and
responded to, and downplaying the accumulated knowledge and wisdom
embodied in traditional knowledge systems that can provide valuable
lessons for adaptation. In this way, climate change is constructed as a
problem *for* society as opposed to a problem *of* society, directing
attention away from the underlying root causes of vulnerability.In
contrast to the global framing of climate change discourse for
indigenous populations, there is an increasingly rich and diverse body
of scholarship examining vulnerability and adaptation to climate change
at a local to regional level, with a number of studies focusing on
health. Such case study research typically focuses on particular places,
peoples, and cultures, but this work can also be used to identify
broader trends in
understanding.[^[12--14]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

over the past 2 decades (1990--2010) on indigenous health and climate
change to identify and characterize the systemic or systemwide
determinants of vulnerability, examine the sufficiency of our knowledge
base, and identify priorities for future research and current action. I
identified publications through the use of multiple search engines, with
inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to capture studies focusing on
impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability but excluding mitigation. Full

sensitivities]{.underline}]{.mark} to climate change, [[a function of
close relationships with and dependence on land, sea, and natural
resources; livelihoods; culture; and habitation in regions that are

These factors create risk profiles that differ significantly from
nonindigenous populations, and also among and between indigenous groups
([[Figure

**Unique Sensitivity of Indigenous Populations to Climate Change**¶
Understanding of the specific characteristics of climate change--related
exposures and sensitivity is greatest for the Arctic and Australia (see
data available as a supplement to the online version of this article at
[[http://www.ajph.org]{.underline}](http://www.ajph.org/)). In the
Arctic, many climate-related health outcomes are propagated through
traditional food cultures, which have significant importance for many
indigenous populations globally. There is strong empirical understanding
of these links for Inuit and Alaska Natives, with sea ice change already
constraining food access with implications for nutrition and cultural
well-being.[^[19--24]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
**Warming temperatures have the potential to affect infectious diseases
associated with the storing and preparation of traditional foods (e.g.,
gastroenteritis, food-borne botulism), zoonotic diseases (e.g.,
giardiasis),[^[25]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
and traditional plants or
remedies**.[^[26]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Documented health risks facing Australia's Aboriginal population with
climate change are quite different, associated with occupation in
high-risk areas where we have a baseline understanding of how the
climate is
changing.[^[27,28]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Studies have typically examined health concerns surrounding extreme
events; in particular, cyclones, flooding, and high temperature are
prominent
concerns.[^[28--31]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)Other
studies have identified sea-level rise and settlement viability, and
infectious diseases (e.g., dengue, Murray Valley encephalitis, malaria)
as the main risks affecting
health.[^[32]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Two Australian studies examined the mental health dimensions of climate
change,[^[30,33]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
a topic not examined in other regions yet of key importance given links
between access to traditional lands and mental
well-being.[^[34,35]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¶
Sensitivity to climate-related health outcomes is also determined by the
organization and structure of health systems, current burden of ill
health, and material conditions and behavioral factors; that is, the
social determinants of health. Herein, a number of generalizations
across regions and populations can be derived from existing
scholarship.¶ First, traditional approaches to and conceptualizations of
health remain central for many indigenous populations, based on an
ideological substratum of concepts, notions, and ideas based around
interpersonal and environmental relationships, stewardship, life
experience and balance, spiritual considerations, family, and oral
history.[^[36]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
The scope for climate change to affect health, therefore, is broader
than altering the incidence and prevalence of disease, with potential
for a range of indirect impacts, many of which will be associated with
sociocultural well-being. "Western" or "allopathic" approaches are also
important in contemporary indigenous health systems, and have been
credited with increasing life expectancy in many regions through, for
example, vaccinations and improved
hygiene.[^[37--39]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Depending on location and historical relationships with the state, these
components of the health system may exhibit a complementary or
competitive relationship. Constraints to accessing allopathic health,
however, are widely noted across regions, a function of financial,
geographic, and cultural barriers including a history (and current
experience) of oppression through the medical system for some
groups.[^[37,40]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
These challenges have implications for informing populations about risk
avoidance and prevention activities in light of a changing climate.¶
[**Second, social and economic disadvantage are evident in continuing
and persistent high rates of poverty and burden of ill health for many
indigenous populations, and access to education, housing, and employment
are typically well below that of nonindigenous
populations.**[^38^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)]{.underline}
These conditions **[[increase sensitivity to climate-related health
outcomes]{.mark} through]{.underline}** a number of pathways, including
forcing people to live in suboptimal conditions, engage in dangerous
activities, live in areas of high risk, and engage in unhealthy
behaviors. For Aboriginal people in Canada and Australia, house
overcrowding has been identified as increasing the risk of communicable
diseases and favoring transmission of respiratory and gastrointestinal
illness---health outcomes that could be affected by projected warming
temperatures.[^[27,41--43]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Inadequate water infrastructure, common in many remote communities,
increases the likelihood of outbreaks of temperature-related waterborne
diseases including diarrheal disease and parasitic infections,
particularly in low-income
nations.[^[22,27,44,45]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Among Inuit populations, a high prevalence of food insecurity associated
with poverty and high cost of living is expected to increase sensitivity
to nutritional deficiency caused by climate change--related stresses on
traditional food systems, with women and children identified to be at
high
risk[^[22,46]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com);
similar challenges have been identified for Alaska Native
villages,[^[47,48]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
and among Amazonian
communities.[^[49]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¶
In poorer regions of the world, although population-specific data are
lacking, it is possible to infer significant sensitivity to climate
change because of pronounced health inequality among indigenous
populations, which experience some of the highest rates of infant
mortality, nutritional deficiency, and rates of infectious and parasitic
disease
globally.[^[38,50]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Particularly in frontier zones being affected by rapid resource
development, health systems are under significant stress associated with
land expropriation, introduction of new diseases, erosion of traditional
institutions, marginalization, and exposure to social and political
violence.[^[4]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
In the Amazon, for example, a resurgence of hydrocarbon-related resource
development and deforestation is challenging access to and ownership of
traditional lands, introducing new diseases, and creating conditions for
the spread and reemergence of existing diseases, a number of which have
a strong link to temperature and precipitation (e.g., dengue, malaria,
leishmaniasis, cholera), with climate projections indicating more
favorable future
conditions.[^[51--58]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
For Central Africa's Batwa population, insufficient resources and a
heavy burden of disease are likely to create significant vulnerability
to the projected health impacts of climate
change.[^[59--62]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
These challenges are likely to be elevated for Uganda's Batwa, where
eviction from traditional forest lands to high-density fixed settlements
with poor sanitation and**[limited access to water and food has
increased exposure and sensitivity to climate-related health risks
including malaria and parasitic infections, while violence and
discrimination limit access to formal health
services]{.underline}**.[^[50,63,64]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)Projections
of increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall events could be
particularly problematic, with waterborne disease outbreaks (e.g.,
typhoid, bacillary dysentery, *Escherichia coli*, and cryptosporidiosis)
typically following heavy rainfall events and associated with fecal
matter being washed into local water
sources.[^[65--67]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)¶
**[[Significant Adaptive Capacity of Indigenous
Populations]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ **[The literature indicates that
existing sensitivities will result in climate change impacts occurring
faster and of greater magnitude for many indigenous
populations.]{.underline}** Yet indigenous populations may also have
significant adaptive capacity. Empirical work, mostly conducted in the
Arctic, describes adaptations currently being employed to cope with a
rapidly changing environment with a strong focus on food systems and
dangers of engaging in harvesting activities. Adaptations are
underpinned by traditional knowledge of lands and resources, cultural
identity, and strong social and kinship networks, within health systems
that combine allopathic and traditional
approaches.[^[19--22,24,68]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
This adaptive capacity is critical for managing the risks of climate
change. A number of studies also describe community-based initiatives to
raise awareness of climate change impacts and using research to empower
communities, and there are examples in the Arctic of the development of
surveillance infrastructure for climate-related health
outcomes.[^[69]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Few studies, however, have examined how non-Arctic groups are responding
to the health effects of climate change, and how economic resources,
institutions, technology, equity, and information and skills affect this
ability.¶ There is concern expressed in the literature that social,
economic, and political transformations---rooted in colonial history,
assimilationist policies, and accelerated by globalization---are having
implications, many negative, for indigenous populations and their
adaptive capacity. Poverty, marginalization, and lack of legal land
title are all important contextual factors that affect adaptation and
will be key challenges in the future. In Alaska and northern Canada,
transformations of identity and community have resulted in loss of
control, cultural continuity, and a weakening of traditional knowledge
systems and social capital. Notwithstanding these historical conditions,
significant progress has been made in developed nations in settling land
claims and recognizing indigenous title, national governments have
apologized for the colonial practices of history (e.g., Canada,
Australia), and devolution of power to indigenous institutions has
occurred in some jurisdictions. These developments hold promise for
addressing some of the broader determinants of socioeconomic and health
inequality that lie at the heart of indigenous vulnerability to climate
change.¶ Poorer nations face more substantial challenges. Particularly
in remote regions experiencing significant resource development
pressure, indigenous integration into the global economy is occurring
often with limited respect for local autonomy, and accompanied by social
and political violence. Associated acculturation challenges have been
linked to problems of addiction, suicide, and a weakening of social
networks and traditional knowledge systems that play an important role
in indigenous health systems and contribute to significant adaptive
capacity.[^[33]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
The process of change and how groups experience and respond to outside
stresses, however, is dynamic, and one in which indigenous peoples are
actively making, remaking, and challenging their circumstances, with
varying degrees of success. Inevitably there will be winners and losers,
with concern expressed that climate change could exacerbate existing
inequalities at community, regional, and national
levels.[^[22]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
In the Peruvian Amazon, for example,
Hofmeijer[^[49]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
describes how socioeconomic changes linked to resource development and
improved transportation have enhanced access to regional health centers
and monetary resources important for adaptation, but have also
undermined traditional knowledge systems. Similarly, working with the
Tsiname peoples of the Bolivian Amazon, Reyes-García et
al.[^[70]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)documented
increasing access to the market economy leading to a loss of knowledge
of folk plant use. The potential health implications of an erosion of
traditional knowledge systems in the context of climate change have not
been examined outside an Arctic or Australian context, although the loss
of response diversity and flexibility embodied in such knowledge systems
has relevance for the management, response to, and avoidance of
climate-related health risks that are projected to become more
problematic in the future.¶ **Gaps in Understanding**¶ Existing
scholarship develops a baseline understanding of the characteristics and
determinants of vulnerability to the health effects of climate change
for indigenous populations in a number of high-income nations, but there
are significant geographic disparities. It is estimated that there are
approximately 370 million indigenous people globally and at least 5000
distinct groups, with only a small fraction explicitly studied with
regard to the health impacts of climate change. We know the least about
regions with the largest indigenous populations, including Africa, Asia,
and Latin America. It is likely that vulnerability will be high on
account of a high burden of ill health, marginalization, and current
exposure to climate-related health risks. Population-specific
understanding on the nature of vulnerabilities and determinants remains
unknown, however, and compromises our ability to safeguard the health of
the most
vulnerable.[^[71]{.underline}^](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300752?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
In particular, adaptation financing provided through the UNFCCC---the
United Nations convention that provides a global architecture for
responding to climate change---depends upon the identification of urgent
and immediate priorities for intervention: information that is generally
lacking for indigenous peoples' health. This deficit is also evident in
completed National Adaptation Programs of Action assessments conducted
in the least developed countries and funded by the UNFCCC to identify
urgent and immediate needs of the poorest nations to adapt to climate
change. As of March 2011, 45 of 49 National Adaptation Programs of
Action assessments had been submitted, with explicit reference to
indigenous populations made in 5 (data available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at
[http://www.ajph.org](http://www.ajph.org/)). In these cases,
assessments note the potential for heightened vulnerability among
indigenous populations, and identify importance of traditional knowledge
for adaptation, but do not focus on health or identify specific concerns
or needs for indigenous populations in light of a changing climate.¶
Although there is a strong bias toward high-income nations in the
literature, there are also widespread disparities within and between
these nations. In Canada, only 2 indigenous populations are studied,
there is no reporting from Scandinavia or Russia, and only 1 paper
reports from the conterminous United States. Disparities are also
reflected in the nature of studies conducted, with the majority of
empirical and adaptation research taking place in the Arctic and
reflective of strong climate change signal evident in this region. Few
studies have focused on differential vulnerability at a community level
or examined high-risk groups (e.g., elderly, children) and research has
largely been conducted in remote regions where indigenous peoples are
often disadvantaged greatest but where links to traditional livelihoods
and activities are strongest.

and related CAP methods thus involve envisioning future climate
conditions and events---[[including severe droughts, floods, and
fires]{.underline}]{.mark}---and their implications. Implications
include climate change "winners" or management opportunities, and even
the undesirable implications can be effective at increasing awareness
and motivating action ([Burt and Nair,

Across various domains, envisioning undesirable future outcomes can be
used to catalyze a proactive response, a strategy sometimes referred to
as fear appeals, negative framing, or loss framing ([O\'neill and
Nicholson-Cole,
2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref90); [Ruiter

Effectiveness of such strategies depends broadly on the degree of moral
obligation felt by the recipient(s) and their perceived individual or
collective efficacy in addressing the challenges presented ([Armbruster
et al.,
2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref4); [Chen,

IK-holders may be uniquely impacted, as they may embody a heightened
sense of moral obligation when faced with environmental concerns
([Jostad et al.,
1996](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref62))
and may further possess lower senses of efficacy (e.g., tend to be
socio-economically, geographically, and culturally
disenfranchised; [Cornell,
2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref25); [LaFromboise

2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref71)).

For example, consider the relative moral obligation and self-efficacy
experienced by a hypothetical manager and an elderly IK-holder in
addressing a drying fresh-water spring. The manager may see the spring
as a livestock drinking station, an economically valuable but
replaceable commodity, and may be equipped with funding, equipment,
operational guidelines, and staff to address it. The IK-holder may view
the same spring as an irreplaceable home to deities known in visceral
relational terms and may have relatively limited capacity to implement
restoration.

For the UMU-CP scenario planning workshop, the primary audience was UMU
environmental managers, and the scenario planning exercise seemed to
promote productive recognition of the climatic changes confronting the
Tribe. Two IK-holders also had the opportunity to participate directly
in the workshop. Envisioning implications of different future climate
conditions for resources yielded scenarios involving extreme drought,
loss of traditional foods, and desertification of rangelands. These
implications evoked sincere discussions by IK-holders regarding the
ability of young generations to/not to continue cultural traditions,
community health and survival, and historical and future resolve to stay
in their homelands.

Deepening the sense of moral obligation, [[some IK systems]{.mark} [may
entail a feeling of responsibility]{.mark} for climatic changes,
[perceiving climate change as occurring]{.mark} in part [due to lack of
community adherence to ceremonial protocols]{.mark}]{.underline}
([Boillat and Berkes,
2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref11)).
[[Envisioning]{.mark} environmental [catastrophes]{.mark} [may also
invoke apocalyptic prophecies]{.mark} found throughout many Native
American religions]{.underline} ([Irwin,

2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref59)).

In so much as IK-holders may muster proactive responses to envisioned
climate change scenarios, [[such responses may take unique
forms]{.underline}]{.mark} ([Ford et al.,
2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref56))
such as ceremonial activities, youth engagement, or restoring
traditional cultural practices ([Boillat and Berkes,
2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref11); [Schramm

For example, the Tribal Climate Adaptation Menu lists 'Consider cultural
practices and seek spiritual guidance' as the first adaptation strategy
for addressing climate change impacts ([TAM (Tribal Adaptation Menu)
Team,
2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref108)).
Given that ceremonial practices are not widely supported climate
adaptation strategies in formal management settings, such thinking may
inadvertently be stifled in lieu of more normative management
interventions.

[[Given]{.mark} the [potential for increased moral obligation]{.mark},

In this context, [it is all the more important that [researchers and
federal agencies respect the authority of tribal
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} and communities to determine what is in
their own best interest and support such efforts by providing impartial
information to empower tribal-led solutions.

The [[livelihoods]{.mark}, cultural [values]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[identity]{.mark} [of Arctic Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}---who make up between 10% and 15% of the
Arctic population---[are often [underpinned]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a strong
place [attachment to ancestral lands]{.mark} and associated subsistence
hunting, fishing, herding, and trapping activities]{.underline} (Larsen
et al., 2015). Livelihoods that are closely associated with the
environment are also shared by many non-Indigenous peoples, particularly
in Fennoscandia and the Russian north[. This close association with the
natural environment [creates unique sensitivities]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the rapidly changing [climate]{.mark}, and there is a well-established
literature focusing on Indigenous Peoples and local communities in North
America]{.underline}, Greenland, and the European Arctic, with emerging
research in Russia. This work shows a wide diversity of experiences of
climate impacts on subsistence livelihoods with evidence of both
resilience and vulnerability.

[[Declining access and availability of wildlife species]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} [changes in migration]{.mark} [timing]{.mark}, have been
observed to be [compromising food]{.mark} [security]{.mark}]{.underline}
in communities across the circumpolar north. [Vulnerability is most
pronounced where food systems are closely linked to locally harvested
foods, [communities]{.mark} [rely on a narrow]{.mark} [resource
base]{.mark} that is being [undermined]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
[climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark},]{.underline} and/or where cultural
keystone species are no longer harvestable (e.g., see Ford et al.,
2013). Moratoriums on caribou in northern Canada, for example, have been
particularly detrimental due to the cultural importance of the
harvesting, preparation, consumption, and sharing of caribou meat,
compounded by the high costs of substitute foods, with impacts on health
and well-being (Kenny et al., 2018; Parlee et al., 2018; Rathwell,
2020), including experiences of ecological grief (Cunsolo et al., 2020)
(defined by Cunsolo & Ellis, 2018, p. 275 as "the grief felt in relation
to experienced or anticipated ecological losses, including the loss of
species, ecosystems, and meaningful landscapes due to acute or chronic
environmental change").

[[Challenges to transportation]{.underline}]{.mark} noted above have
[[made]{.mark} [practicing]{.mark} [livelihoods]{.mark} more difficult
and [dangerous]{.mark}, [compounded by increasing]{.mark}
[wildfire]{.mark} [risk]{.mark} in some regions]{.underline} (e.g.,
central Alaska, Canada\'s NWT) (Cold et al., 2020; Dodd et al., 2018),
although the role of changing wildfires has not been widely examined.
[[Food and water safety]{.mark} have also been observed to be
[compromised]{.mark} due to warming temperatures and loss of sea ice,
which are [altering]{.mark} the [prevalence]{.mark} and incidence
[of]{.mark} [waterborne]{.mark}, [foodborne]{.mark}, [zoonotic]{.mark}
and vector-borne [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}, and altering
contaminant pathways (Table 2). [Extreme ice conditions]{.underline} in
the Chukchi and northern Bering Seas in 2017, for example, [resulted in
concerns among communities over toxins in walrus means due to harmful
algal blooms]{.underline} (Huntington et al., 2020). Few studies have
quantified changes in food access, availability, and safety in response
to a changing climate, with few long-term datasets on harvesting
(Fauchald, Hausner, et al., 2017), with water security similarly
neglected (Harper et al., 2020; Sohns et al., 2019).

The implications of climate change for subsistence livelihoods and
cultural activities are in many instances shaped by non-climatic
factors, which are often as important as, if not more so, climate
change. Across the Arctic, local and Indigenous communities are coping
with and adapting to climate change, improvising, learning, hybridizing
technologies and knowledge systems, and challenging and negotiating new
environmental and social realities, in many ways mirroring a long
history of resilience to past climate change (Desjardins & Jordan,
2019). Resilience is underpinned by attributes such as agency,
flexibility in resource use, mobility, innovation, and collective action
(Desjardins et al., 2020; Ford et al., 2020; Huntington, Carey, et al.,
2019). In response to climate change impacts on icing events and changes
to river hydrology, Nenets reindeer herders in Yamal, Russia, for
example, have changed their migration routes to use alternative
pastures, increasingly manage their herds privately instead of
collectively, and have benefited from management regimes that have been
sensitive to herders needs (Forbes, 2013; Golovnev, 2017). Communities
in western Greenland have been observed to have increased fishing for
Greenland halibut because of fish movements further north, experimenting
by putting long lines through holes in the ice and switching from mammal
harvesting to fishing (Nuttall, 2020), with a similar increased reliance
on aquatic-based livelihood documented in some Nunavut communities
(Galappaththi et al., 2019). Studies have illustrated how
experimentation, practice, regular interaction, and openness to
alteration have underpinned the continuous updating and re-examination
of what is known in light of new observations and realities, helping
communities adapt to change (Table S3). Many of these attributes have
developed and evolved in-light of considerable past change in societal
and environmental conditions, equipping Arctic communities for
challenging and uncertain futures (Desjardins et al., 2020).

The literature also documents many [[examples of vulnerabilities]{.mark}
[emerging]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [climate]{.mark} change, [linked]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} longer term [stresses]{.mark} resulting [from]{.mark} land
[dispossession]{.mark}, landscape fragmentation, and a weakening of
links to place]{.underline}. These trends have [increased exposure and
sensitivity to climate impacts by modifying human--environment
connections]{.underline} (e.g., settlement patterns, land use), have
[undermined factors which historically created resilience]{.underline}
(e.g., knowledge generation and transmission), and created new risks,
differing by (and within) populations (Naylor et al., 2020). Among Inuit
communities, Pearce et al. (2015) document how lifestyle changes have
reduced apprenticeship opportunities for some young Inuit to acquire
important hunting skills, which has reduced the skillsets from which
people are able to draw upon to adapt to changing conditions,
accelerated by the loss of Elders and their knowledge. Effects on the
generation and transmission of LK and IK have been documented in
communities across the Circumpolar North (Ford, McDowell, & Pearce,
2015). In Scandinavia, research has recorded how land privatization and
fragmented pasture access due to development pressures (e.g., roads,
logging operations, wind farms) have reduced the ability of herders to
manage reindeer migration timing in response to changing snow regimes
(Hausner et al., 2019; Kelman & Naess, 2019; Markkula et al., 2019).
International opposition to hunting marine mammals and associated
management regimes (e.g., narwhal tusk, walrus ivory, seal skins) have
affected income earning opportunities and the consequent ability to
invest in hunting equipment necessary to manage climate impacts (e.g.,
safety equipment, boats) while also reducing flexibility (Nuttall, 2020;
Sejersen, 2015). [The [lack of decision]{.mark}-[making]{.mark}
[power]{.mark} in Arctic communities and insufficient authority over
decisions that impact local social--ecological conditions have also been
widely [identified]{.mark} [to limit]{.mark} the [ability to]{.mark}
[manage]{.mark} [change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Berman et al., 2020; Blair
& Lovecraft, 2020; Stammler & Ivanova, 2020). The role of these (often
long-term) non-climatic factors---and other potential future trends---in
shaping vulnerability (or resilience) to future climate impacts has not
been widely examined.

5 \| ADAPTATIONS ARE AVAILABLE BUT THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS
AND LIMITS TO ADAPTING

Climate change adaptation encompasses a variety of strategies, actions,
and behaviors that seek to make households, communities, and societies
more resilient to climate change, and may target reducing exposure and
sensitivity to climate change impacts, and/or focus on strengthening
resilience and adaptive capacity. [[Adaptation is a priority]{.mark}
[for Arctic regions]{.mark} given the significant risks posed by current
and projected future climate change]{.underline} (AMAP, 2017), although
aside from a few studies in the 2000s (e.g., Chapin et al., 2006; Ford
et al., 2007; Newton et al., 2005), adaptation has only recently emerged
as a focus in Arctic research

Industrial fishing has been a major driver of population decline. Large
predatory fish like tuna, swordfish, and cod have been decimated by
massive industrial fleets. Recent assessments show that [a third of the

former **abundance** and accepts a **diminished state** as
normal]{.underline}. Pauly's work shows that peak fish catch likely
occurred in the 1990s, with global catches in decline ever

That's especially true in places like Southeast Asia, West Africa and

adds that the ocean has absorbed much of humanity's planetary
overshoot---not just carbon but excess heat. As ecosystems collapse,
food webs simplify. With the loss of large predators, jellyfish, algae,
and smaller fish dominate. Coral reefs are in widespread decline due to
warming, acidification, and direct human impact. [While we assume the

Circulation](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/124-levke-caesar)
(AMOC). This global conveyor of ocean currents transports warm surface
water poleward and returns cold water at depth (Figure 3). Higher global
temperatures have accelerated the melting of Greenland and Antarctic
ice, adding fresh water to the North Atlantic. This "freshening"
disrupts the sinking of salty, denser water, weakening the AMOC. [The
result is slower global circulation of heat and carbon, altered rainfall

### 1AR \-\-- Past Tipping Points 

#### We've Passed a Climate Tipping Point -- the 1.5° benchmark broke already

weather-related events, crime, and community announcements. She was

Galaxy; "

The United Nations has issued a stark warning: there is a 70 percent
chance that the Earth's average temperature from 2025 to 2029 will
exceed the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius warming threshold. The findings,
published in a new report by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO), suggest that [[the planet]{.mark} will [continue to endure
historic levels of heat]{.mark}, [following record-breaking
temperatures]{.mark} in 2023 and 2024.]{.underline} The 1.5°c Target
Slipping Away According to the WMO, each of the next five years is
projected to register global near-surface temperatures between 1.2°C and
1.9°C above pre-industrial levels. This estimate is based on the
1850--1900 average, a baseline used to measure the effects of
industrial-era greenhouse gas emissions. The WMO's five-year forecast,
compiled by the UK Met Office and other leading global centers, aligns
with growing scientific concern that the 1.5°C target set by the 2015
Paris climate accords may now be beyond reach. ["This is entirely
consistent with our proximity to passing 1.5°C on a long-term basis in
the late 2020s or early 2030s," said Peter Thorne, director of the Irish
Climate Analysis and Research Units group at the University of Maynooth.
Thorne predicted that [within the next "two to three years, this
probability \[will be\] 100 percent]{.mark}."]{.underline} New
Benchmarks For Global Heat The report also reveals an 80 percent
probability that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will surpass
2024 as the hottest year on record. Longer-term climate assessments
suggest that warming has already approached dangerous territory. Using a
methodology that blends observed temperatures from 2015--2024 with
predictions through 2034, the WMO estimates current warming at 1.44°C.
Meanwhile, the Copernicus Climate Change Service puts that number
slightly lower at 1.39°C, yet forecasts that 1.5°C could be breached by
mid-2029 or sooner. The report also mentions a one percent chance that a
year between 2025 and 2029 could exceed 2°C of warming, a scenario
previously considered implausible. "It is shocking," said Adam Scaife
from the Met Office. "That probability is going to rise." [He pointed
out that similar projections made a decade ago regarding the [1.5 °C
benchmark were once dismissed---until they were realized in
2024]{.mark}.]{.underline} Extreme Weather Signs Already Visible [[The
real-world effects of this rapid warming are already being felt across
continents]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recent weeks, China has recorded
temperatures soaring beyond 40 °C, the United Arab Emirates reached
nearly 52 °C, and Pakistan endured deadly winds after an intense
heatwave. Elsewhere, floods have devastated parts of Australia, France,
Algeria, India, China, and Ghana, while wildfires have raged across
Canada. "We've already hit a dangerous level of warming," noted
Friederike Otto, climatologist at Imperial College London. "Relying on
oil, gas, and coal in 2025 is total lunacy," she added. Her view is
echoed by Davide Faranda of France's CNRS, who emphasized that the
science is "unequivocal" in calling for urgent cuts to fossil fuel
emissions and an accelerated transition to clean energy. Polar Regions
And Rain Patterns Also Shifting The report highlights a continued
acceleration of warming in the Arctic, a region already heating up
faster than the global average. Predictions for 2025--2029 indicate
ongoing loss of sea ice in the Barents Sea, Bering Sea, and the Sea of
Okhotsk. In terms of precipitation, the Sahel, northern Europe, Alaska,
and northern Siberia are expected to become wetter than average, while
Amazonia is likely to experience drier conditions. [These projections
point to a [future of]{.mark} growing [climatic instability, with each
fraction of a degree in warming increasing the likelihood of heatwaves,
extreme storms, droughts, and melting ice]{.mark}. As Ko Barrett, the
WMO's deputy secretary-general, concluded: "There will be a growing
negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and
our planet."]{.underline}

#### Multiple tipping points already crossed or statistically likely to be to far gone

University; Broadcast Journalism/Spanish from Northwestern State

Tipping Points, Scientists Warn,"

April 26, 2025\] BC

[Our [planet is headed toward]{.mark} several catastrophic climate
[tipping p]{.mark}oints]{.underline}, according to new research. This
matters because [once]{.underline} these ["tipping points" are crossed,
they can trigger dramatic environmental shifts that cannot be
reversed]{.underline}. **[[A new study]{.underline}]{.mark}** published
in the European Geosciences Union **[[paints a remarkably grim
picture]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It highlights [threats such as the
collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, dieback of rainforests and rapid
thawing of permafrost.]{.underline} These changes would severely impact
human well-being and global stability. What's most concerning about
these tipping points is that [[once triggered, the changes often
escalate on their own]{.mark}, without additional human input. This
endless loop can amplify global warming and make it even more difficult
to mitigate the effects of climate change]{.underline}. Ice sheet
calving plays a key role in sea level rise, particularly from the
Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. Permafrost Thaw: Permafrost,
covering vast areas in the Arctic, holds large amounts of carbon in
frozen organic matter. As temperatures rise, permafrost begins to thaw,
releasing greenhouse gases like methane into the atmosphere. This
release accelerates warming in a dangerous feedback loop. If significant
portions thaw, billions of tons of carbon could enter the atmosphere,
further fueling Earth's warming. Greenland Ice Sheet Melting: If it
melts significantly, it could raise global sea levels by several feet.
The melting of this ice sheet is triggered by rising global
temperatures, and once it reaches a certain threshold, it could begin to
melt much faster. This would lead to widespread coastal flooding,
threatening millions of people who live near sea level. Amazon
Rainforest Dieback: The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the
"lungs of the Earth," plays a vital role in absorbing carbon dioxide.
However, increasing deforestation and climate change are pushing the
Amazon toward a tipping point. If temperatures rise too high or
deforestation continues at its current pace, the rainforest could begin
to die back, releasing stored carbon and turning from a carbon sink into
a carbon source. This would significantly amplify global warming.
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: The AMOC is a vital ocean
current that helps regulate global climate. If the AMOC slows or
collapses due to rising temperatures and melting ice, it could lead to
more extreme weather patterns in Europe, Africa and the Americas. A
collapse of the AMOC would severely impacting agriculture and
ecosystems. Researchers calculated the probabilities of triggering 16
known climate tipping points. They factored in uncertainties like
climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and the exact temperature
thresholds at which tipping points occur. The **[scie[ntists concluded
that there is a 62% chance of triggering at least one tipping
point]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[and nine tipping elements have more
than a 50% probability of being crossed]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [These
include the Greenland Ice Sheet collapse, abrupt permafrost thaw and
Amazon rainforest dieback.]{.underline} An aerial image of the Amazon
Rainforest. Findings show that if we drastically cut emissions we can
cut our chances of triggering a tipping point by roughly half. However,
**[there's growing concern that [it might already be too late for some
systems]{.mark}, as some tipping points could be triggered at [as little
as 1.8 degree Fahrenheit of warming, a threshold we have already
reached.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Earth's climate in 2024 is "in a major crisis with worse to come if we
continue with business as usual," a team of 14 climate scientists warned
in "The 2024 state of the climate report: Perilous times on planet
Earth." The report did not sugarcoat their view of the dangers humanity
is facing. "[[We are on the brink of an irreversible climate
disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}," the report begins. "This is a global
emergency beyond any doubt. [Much of [the very fabric of life]{.mark} on
Earth [is imperiled. We are stepping into a]{.mark} critical and
unpredictable [new phase of the]{.mark} climate
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}." The report is the latest such annual
peer-reviewed paper published in the journal BioScience by an
international team of scientists led by Oregon State ecologist William
Ripple. The authors found that 25 of 35 "planetary vital signs" reached
record levels last year, including global temperatures, human climate
pollution, fossil fuel subsidies, heat-related mortality rates, meat
production, and loss of forest cover. [After decades of
warnings]{.underline} from climate scientists and efforts by some
policymakers and activists, "[[the world has made]{.mark} only very
[minor headway]{.mark} on climate change]{.underline}, in part because
of stiff resistance from those benefiting financially from the current
fossil-fuel-based system," it says. ["[We are currently going in the
wrong direction]{.mark}]{.underline} and our increasing fossil-fuel
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are driving us toward a climate
catastrophe. We fear the danger of climate breakdown." They did note a
few positive indicators like clean energy production. "Of course, the
situation is not hopeless," wrote Harvard science historian and study
co-author Naomi Oreskes via email. "What we want people to understand is
that, [while there has been [progress]{.mark} -- particularly in the
price and deployment of renewables -- [it's not]{.mark} nearly
[enough]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the atmosphere does not respond to our
intentions. It responds to chemistry." The report calls for "rapidly
phasing down fossil fuel use" by ratcheting up the carbon price in
wealthy countries and using some of the proceeds to fund policies to
stop climate change and adaptation programs to reduce damage from
climate disasters. It also urges sharp reductions in emissions of
methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, to "slow the near-term rate of
global warming, helping to avoid tipping points and extreme climate
impacts." Without a course correction, the report warned, "climate
change could cause many millions of additional deaths by 2050."

Over the last decade, [the federal government has recognized Indigenous
Knowledge as an asset in efforts to combat climate change]{.underline}
and environmental degradation. [The Biden administration]{.underline}
has gone a step further, [instructing federal agencies to integrate
indigenous practices]{.underline} and teachings [into all kinds of
policies --- including those addressing public health]{.underline}.
Agencies are due to report on their progress soon.

#### Climate change irreversible, only sustainable way is adaption

[[Climate change is already happening]{.mark} [given]{.mark} the amount
of the historical [emissions]{.mark} [of]{.mark} anthropogenic
[greenhouse]{.mark} [gas]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hegerl et al., 2007) and
will keep altering many habitats, amenities and ecosystems (Meehl et
al., 2007). [[Mitigation measures cannot prevent climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark}]{.underline} which has happened already and its effects.
In addition, it takes minimum a few decades and global collective
actions to see apparent effects from implementing mitigation measures
compared to [[more immediate benefits within]{.mark} a local or regional
scale for [adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Füssel, 2007). It should
also be mentioned that most [[adaptation]{.mark} measures also
[help]{.mark} [reducing]{.mark} the risks [from]{.mark} current climate
variation, which could be tremendous [environmental and social
hazards]{.mark}]{.underline} (Füssel & Klein, 2006). Based on the above,
the focus of this study is adaptation measures because the objectives of
the study are pastoral communities in Inner Mongolia, which focuses on
measures on a local scale within rather short period of time, mitigation
of climate change is not discussed. In terms of space, only pastoral
regions in Inner Mongolian grassland is studied, and urban areas and
traditional farming or agriculture areas are excluded from the scope.
And in terms of the scope of time period, the past four decades have
been the most transformational time for the pastoral communities in
Inner Mongolia, both for the way of production and for the natural
environment, since the spreading of land tenure reform in the 1980s (Liu
at al, 2019). Therefore, the main focus of time period is set on the
past four decades. As climate change is a complicated process that
happens within the context of economic globalization, which is referred
as "double exposure" (O'Brien and Leichenko, 2000), there are many
factors that influence the vulnerability of the pastoral communities as
well as the assessments, dynamics and results of the climate change
adaptation measures. Moreover, **human adaptation to climate change is
not a well-defined set of activities and the diversity of its contexts
suggests the complexity for assessing, planning and implementing those
measures** (Füssel, 2007). Connected to the scope of the study, as the
objectives are pastoral communities that have experienced institutional
changes on climate adaptation measures, there is no control groups being
assessed when conducting interviews on herders' opinions, as in those
who have not been through changes on climate adaptation measures in the
past few decades. Also, as social vulnerability and economic reform make
up important parts in this study, it should be mentioned that the author
is not an expert of sociology or economy, and the study of social
vulnerability and economic globalization is merely understood by the
point of view from climate change adaptation and environment management.

[[As they interacted]{.mark} with coastal communities for longer
stretches of time, [US]{.mark} whalers and [scientists changed their
thinking about Inuit life]{.mark} and Arctic land. [Ideas of danger that
had for so long characterized the circumpolar world began to fade by the
1890s.]{.mark}]{.underline} Such was the final knell of British and
Russian empires and a signal of a century of intervention to come. [The
[research]{.mark} party of the International Polar Year [initially
reproduced British representations of Inuit as
hostile.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The commander]{.underline} of the party,
Lieutenant Ray, [[prohibited expedition]{.mark} members from visiting
Nuwuk and Utkiavik,]{.underline} two Inuit communities in the vicinity
of Point Barrow, [because he regarded the Natives as
savage.]{.underline} [Ray's fears [stemmed from what]{.mark} he
[described as a growing local dependency]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
whalers. He noted that Inuit were "disaffected" because their "usual
supply of whisky, arms, and ammunition from the whaling fleet" had been
unavailable because of a poor whaling year. He also appealed to his
superior, General Hazen, for Revenue Cutters to peruse the area and
prevent the sale of "contraband goods." [[These appeals were
representations that attest to a tenuous administrative presence in the
area.]{.underline}]{.mark} They also document, without intention, the
movements of Inuit from western coastal Alaska to the north slope.37
[Naturalists John Murdoch and Middleton Smith also portrayed Inuit as
uniquely powerful. For instance, Smith's notes on the ice conditions of
the Beaufort Sea often included remarks about Inuit who were hunting
seal or bear. While such activity does not seem to present risk to
Smith, the orders that guided his fieldwork laced these observations
with concern.]{.underline} Because of the commitment to meteorology and
hydrography, and the restrictions from Lieutenant Ray, neither Murdoch
nor Smith could venture far from the station. Reading Smith's logbook,
one can imagine the experience of being shut in for months on end. Such
stillness would have made readily apparent the movement of life around
him, a kind of freedom he did not enjoy. Smith showed excitement and
trepidation in brief visits from Inuit, who came to the station to trade
with him. These visits must have been nerve-racking for Smith and
Murdoch because they constituted both a test of Ray's suspicions of
violence and the scientists' only chance of procuring natural history
collections.38 [[As whalers wintered-­ over in the north and became
inhabitants of the Arctic, their ideas shifted, presenting the region as
more friendly as long as one adapted to it.]{.mark} In his
autobiography, [American whaler-­ turned-­ Arctic resident Jim Allen
recalled learning how to build houses throughout the
year]{.mark}.]{.underline} This involved finding the right kind of snow
in winter and collecting driftwood from tributaries in the summer.
[[Allen also described the importance of dogs to the project of
traveling]{.mark},]{.underline} providing readers with instructions on
how to harness the animals and what to feed them to keep them strong and
obedient. Since dogs fed mostly on seal, [[Allen and other whalers
mastered the seal hunt]{.underline}]{.mark}, including what weapons to
use and how to make them, when to hunt seal, and how to hunt in various
rain and snow conditions. [[**Residential knowledge,** which derived
from the experiences of living in the environment for longer than a
whaling season,]{.mark} seemed to [challenge]{.mark} Allen's [former
conceptions of the treacherous northern landscape.]{.mark} Of course,
[his autobiography and that of other whalers who shared their stories in
print later in life had ghostwriters. Inuit men and women, who offered
Arctic education to American transplants, **were often silent and
unnamed** characters in whaler memories.]{.mark} "When we first went
north," Hartson Bodfish remembered, "we provided ourselves with heavy
woolen clothing of all kinds." "But before the end of this first
winter," he recalled, "we adopted the native dress altogether, and
provided outfits for all the men." In between the lines of Allen and
Bodfish's sentiments one can read the labor of Inuit men and women as
well as their relationships to Arctic representations in the 1890s.
[Inuit were being excluded from the north even as their excluders relied
on them for survival.39]{.mark}32]{.underline} Scientific knowledge also
evolved over the 1890s, but not in the same ways as whaler knowledge.
Rather than earn a sense of comfort with deeper understanding,
scientists developed greater concern, especially over the impact whalers
had on northern lands and people. A visit to Herschel Island in 1892
startled naturalist Frank Russell. The Dene guides he traveled with
dropped their Gwich'in language when speaking with coastal Inuit,
adopting instead a "trade jargon" that included Hawaiian words. Stepping
inside an Inuit tent near Pauline Cove, Russell found "coffee, flour,
and syrup" from nearby whaling vessels. Before leaving for San
Francisco, Russell made a final collecting trip in search of a ptarmigan
in its summer plumage. Traveling with Inuit families who were crossing
to the mainland to trade with Dene there, Russell noted that his water
taxi was a whaleboat owned by Inuit made wealthy from commercial
whaling. These changes must have appeared as stark for Russell, who, in
preparation for his trip north, had been reading accounts of British
Royal Navy explorers. [[The dangerous and barren Arctic of the mid-1800s
was likely no comparison for the strange calm Russell came to
know.40]{.underline}]{.mark}

Over the last decades, climate variability and, more specifically,
global climate change have entered the mainstream of international
discourse, reflection and concern. One recent out- come of this global
preoccupation with climate has been a growing interest in how weather,
climate variability and climate change might be experienced, understood
and interpreted by societies and cultures around the world, including
those of indigenous peoples. In these diverse ecological, social and
cultural settings, what changes are people observing and what responses
might be the most appropriate and effective? This in turn raises the
issue of what policies and what actions are required to guide
adjustments to actual or expected future climate and its effects (IPCC,
2014: 5). To ensure that climate change decision- making recognizes and
supports local priorities and needs, it is critical to be aware of what
is already being experienced on the ground. Without this understanding,
decisions may not only fail to provide assistance to those most in need,
but may inadvertently undermine local resilience and increase
vulnerability.This volume presents a selection of case studies that
illustrate how [knowledge and practice rooted in indigenous
communities]{.mark} may [inform\[s\] our understandings of climate
change processes, and how indigenous coping strategies provide a crucial
foundation for community-based adaptation.]{.mark} It also confronts
some recurrent but misleading assertions about climate change impacts
and responses with actual accounts from indigenous com- munities around
the globe. It therefore contributes to a newly emerging field that
builds synergies among a wide range of disciplines, from both the
natural and social sciences, to address climate change assessment and
adaptation in accordance with the observations, practices, knowledge and
priorities of indigenous peoples. The Emergence of Indigenous Knowledge
in the Global Climate Change Arena. Global climate change was identified
in the 1980s as one of humanity's most daunting challenges (see early
history in UNFCCC, 1992; Maslin, 2014: 16--19). This recogni- tion led
to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) in 1988, and the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in 1992 (Earth Summit, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) that
established the United Nations Framework. Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). Since that time, world attention roused by the global climate
change debate has largely concentrated on particular areas of the planet
-- low-lying tropical islands and coastlines, high-altitude zones,
tropical forests and the polar regions (Orlove et al., 2014). It so
happens that most of these areas, except ice-covered Antarctica, are
home to indigenous peoples. Despite the world's growing interest in
indi- genous peoples and their homelands as harbingers of the impacts of
planetary climate change, [much work needs to be done to understand
their concerns and appreciate their knowledge]{.mark} (see Box 1.1).
Interest in the perspectives and knowledge of indigenous peoples (see
Box 1.2) first emerged in certain world regions and on certain themes.
In the Arctic, the Earth's northern polar region, indigenous voices were
heard loud and clear already by the year 2000, perhaps because the shift
in its climate regime has been one of the most dramatic and pronounced
on the planet (see Larsen et al., 2014). Owing to these and other
factors, polar peoples' observations and concerns about transitions
triggered by the changing climate and wea- ther were rapidly reported
and were widely circulated in scholarly and political circles (McDonald
et al., 1997; Weller et al., 1999; IISD, 2000; Huntington, 2000; Krupnik
and Jolly, 2002; Herlander and Mustonen, 2004; Nickels, 2005).In
addition, since 1996, the Arctic has a unique political body called the
Arctic Council. It includes eight Arctic nation states as its founding
members, several 'observers' (both other states and organizations) and
also six 'permanent participants' representing polar indigenous peoples
-- the Inuit, Sami, Aleut, Gwich'in, other Dene/Athabaskan groups and
indigenous nations of northern Russia. The Arctic Council has been very
active on issues related to environmental change and it has historically
welcomed indigenous peoples' interests and voices, as seen in its
seminal *Arctic Climate Impact Assessment* (ACIA, 2005) and several
other studies it initiated. The Arctic may be a rare example where a
strong consensus has developed among scientists, indigenous peoples,
politicians and local governments about the threats brought by the
changing environment *and* the need to engage polar residents in common
actions -- observation, research, assessment, adaptation and
mitigation.A similar combination of local factors favoured a more
proactive response in another area critically affected by rapid climate
change, low-lying tropical islands (Lazrus, 2012; Orlove et al., 2014).
Here the push for local people's voices and knowledge in climate change
assessment had the additional advantage of a direct state presence in
intergov- ernmental forums. Small island developing states (SIDS),
whether from the Caribbean or the Atlantic, Indian or Pacific Oceans,
are United Nations Member States and are them- selves Parties to the
UNFCCC. In the Pacific, SIDS are 'indigenous states' with majority
populations of indigenous peoples with their distinctive languages,
institutions, cultures and histories. The New York-based
intergovernmental Alliance of Small Island States also provided a
platform to mobilize shared concerns and demands. From the early 2000s,
island voices could be heard directly in global arenas and through
networks of non-governmental players, anthropological and other
scientific studies, independent environmentalists and filmmakers (see
Lazrus, 2012; Rudiak-Gould, 2013).Recognition of indigenous knowledge is
a recent development in the climate sciences in general and in the
understanding of global climate change in particular. For this reason,
it may be useful to introduce some basic concepts and definitions for
readers whose encounter with indigenous knowledge may be relatively
recent[.The term 'indigenous knowledge' makes reference to knowledge and
know-how that have been accumulated across generations and which guide
human societies in their innumerable interactions with their surrounding
environment.]{.mark} Such traditional ecological knowledge is defined
as: 'a cumulative body of knowledge, practice and belief, [evolving by
adaptive processes and handed down through generations by cultural
transmission, about the relationship of living beings]{.mark} (including
humans) with one another and with their environment' (Berkes, 2012:
7).These knowledge systems [are transmitted and renewed by each
succeeding generation. They ensure the well-being of people around the
globe by providing food security from hunting, fishing, gathering,
pastoralism or small-scale agriculture, as well as health care,
clothing, shelter and strategies for coping with environmental
fluctuations and external forces of change]{.mark} (Warren et al., 1995;
Nakashima and Roué, 2002; Sillitoe et al., 2002; Sillitoe, 2007).An
abundance of labels for this knowledge coexist in the literature. Common
terms include but are not limited to indigenous knowledge, traditional
knowledge, traditional ecological knowledge, local knowledge, farmers'
knowledge, folk knowledge and indigenous science. Although each term may
have somewhat different connotations and reference groups, they often
share sufficient meaning to be utilized interchangeably (Nakashima and
Roué, 2002). In this publication, the term indigenous knowledge will be
used most frequently, as many of the examples put forward relate to
knowledge developed and maintained by indigenous peoples. However, it
should be recalled that important sets of local knowledge of relevance
for climate change assessment and adaptation is also held by
non-indigenous rural societies (Grabherr, 2009; Lawrence, 2009).It is
also important to keep in mind that much indigenous knowledge is
gendered (Berkes, 2012). While men and women share a great deal of
knowledge, they also hold distinct knowledge sets relating to differing
and complementary roles that they may fulfil in society and in
production. Rocheleau (1991) comments that 'half or more of indigenous
ecological science has been obscured by the prevailing "invisibility" of
women, their work, their interests and especially their knowledge'.In
this publication, the term 'knowledge' is used in its broadest sense.
Though knowledge (in particular scientific knowledge) is often opposed
to practice (science vs technology) and the rational is distinguished
from the spiritual (science vs religion), in indigenous worldviews these
diverse elements are often combined. In a holistic understanding of
human interactions with their surrounding milieu, indigenous knowledge
encompasses not only empirical understandings and deductive thought, but
also community know-how, practices and technology; social organization
and institutions; and spirituality, rituals, rites and cosmologies
(Nakashima and Roué, 2002).

Why does Indigenous knowledge matter when it comes to climate action?

[[Indigenou]{.mark}s]{.underline} Peoples are custodians of unique
knowledge systems, innovations and [[practices]{.underline}]{.mark} that
have been passed down through generations and [have [allowed]{.mark}
different [cultures and communities]{.mark} in many parts of the world
[to live sustainably]{.mark}]{.underline}, emphasizing the balance
between humans and the natural world. [Many Indigenous traditional
practices are rooted in a deep understanding of and respect for
ecological systems and promote sustainable resource use.]{.underline}
These practices have a minimal impact on the environment and are highly
adaptive to ecological changes, fostering healthy and resilient
ecosystems. [Because of their ecological knowledge]{.underline}, which
is intergenerational and community-based[, Indigenous Peoples were among
the first to notice the early signs of climate change]{.underline}. Now
more than ever, [[as the climate crisis intensifies, their]{.mark}
knowledge and [practices offer valuable]{.mark} climate [solutions that
can advance mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} efforts, enhance adaptation
strategies and build resilience[. [This knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}
can also complement scientific data with precise landscape information
that [[is critical to evaluating]{.mark} climate change
[scenarios]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What are some examples of Indigenous knowledge applied to climate
solutions?

[[The milpa]{.mark}, a traditional farming [system of the]{.mark}
Indigenous [Maya]{.mark}]{.underline} in Central America and southern
Mexico, [[is a sustainable agricultural model]{.mark} that involves
rotating agricultural plots]{.underline} -- usually with corn, beans,
squash and other vegetables -- within a forested area. Importantly, this
rotation involves the planting of multiple crops while allowing for
natural forest regeneration in previously cultivated plots[. [As a
result]{.underline}]{.mark}[, these "[forest gardens" maintain
high]{.mark} levels of [biod]{.mark}iversity [and soil fertility]{.mark}
by preserving a mosaic of forest and agricultural habitats, thereby
contributing significantly to climate change mitigation and adaptation
efforts.]{.underline} [Similarly, [in]{.mark}]{.underline} countries in
West [[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}, like Mali and Burkina Faso,
[[Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} have [developed]{.mark} sophisticated
[agroforestry systems]{.mark} over centuries]{.underline}. These
systems, in which crops coexist with trees, help reduce soil erosion and
improve soil fertility. Meanwhile, crop diversification reduces the risk
of total crop failure due to pests, diseases or extreme weather events.
[[These strategies]{.mark} ensure the availability of food and [protect
livelihoods in the face of climate]{.mark} extreme]{.underline}s, such
as droughts and heavy rains. Aboriginal Peoples in Australia have long
practiced traditional fire management, known as \"cultural burning\" or
\"cool burning,\" to manage the landscape. This practice involves the
controlled use of low-intensity fires to reduce fuel loads, manage
vegetation and promote biodiversity. Indigenous Peoples often possess
deep knowledge of fire behavior, weather patterns and ecological
responses, allowing them to conduct burns safely while reducing wildfire
risks.

Why are Indigenous Peoples key agents of change in climate action?

[[Indigenous Peoples manage]{.mark} around [25 percent of the world's
land]{.mark}, which contains much of the planet's biodiversity and the
carbon stored in soil and biomass]{.underline}. A large majority of this
land is covered by forests that are central to the traditions, cultures
and livelihoods of 70 million Indigenous Peoples, who provide
environmental stewardship to at least 36 percent of the world's intact
forests. Research shows that [[despite increasing external
pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} on their land, many [forests and other
[ecosystems]{.mark} within areas [managed by Indigenous Peoples are in
better health than]{.mark} nature [outside]{.mark} these
[areas]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} By safeguarding these key
ecosystems that act as carbon sinks and protect biodiversity, Indigenous
Peoples provide an environmental service to the rest of the world, which
is often unrecognized, and merits increased political protection and
financial support. [Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} have also [developed
adaptive strategies]{.underline} over centuries [to cope with
environmental changes. Their knowledge systems offer valuable insights
into climate-resilient practices]{.underline} such as agroforestry,
water management and disaster preparedness. Examples of this are the use
of traditional crops resilient to drought and the construction of
traditional houses that require minimal water usage in dry environments.
[Nature-based solutions]{.underline} and circular economy [have been a
way of life for millennia for Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} worldwide,
and this knowledge is key to climate action. As such, [[Indigenous
Peoples hold]{.mark} the [potential to be]{.mark} protagonists and
[leaders in decision-making processes on climate
action]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Local Communities and Indigenous
Peoples Platform works to ensure the integration of Indigenous knowledge
and practices into international and national programmes and policies,
and helps Indigenous Peoples prepare to participate and better engage in
climate negotiations.

[[TEK is the knowledge acquired by indigenous]{.mark} and local [peoples
over many hundreds of years through direct or indirect contact with the
environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The detailed knowledge of plants,
animals, and natural phenomena, the development and use of appropriate
technologies for hunting, fishing, trapping, agriculture, forestry and a
holistic knowledge are included. TEK represents the information
necessary for cultural survival which accumulated over many years and
site specific \[6\]. Traditional ecological knowledge is the potential
instrument in climate change assessment and adaptation efforts \[7\].
Indigenous communities have historically a potential to live within the
area and adapted to environmental changes. In many regions of the United
States, Climate change is likely to bring rapid environmental changes
and require broad-scale adaptation strategies. [Therefore, [TEK is
important for]{.mark} [detecting environmental changes,]{.mark} the
development of strategies to adapt to these changes, and the
implementation of sustainable land-management principles \[4\].
[Researchers]{.mark} and scholars [have already begun to

However, incorporating IK into CAP raises critical considerations of
ethics, effectiveness, and the unique positionality of IK vis-à-vis
western science (WS; [Latulippe and Klenk,

Related topics such as IK research ethics, IK integration, and tribal
sovereignty, have been explored theoretically for a variety of
applications, but lessons learned from on-the-ground CAP with IK are
still needed ([Petzold et al.,

In this manuscript, we reflect on an on-going CAP effort that
incorporates IK with the Ute Mountain Ute (UMU) Tribe and share
considerations for others seeking to incorporate IK in CAP. While these
considerations are not exhaustive---indeed, we encourage others to build
upon this initial set---sharing this initial set is motivated by the
growing number of calls to incorporate IK and WS ([Gadgil et al.,

and the attendant risks to tribal communities ([Carroll et al.,

We share practice-based lessons with the aims of supporting CAP
practitioners and researchers navigating the complex terrain of IK
incorporation and fostering ethical collaboration for the benefit of
tribes, federal agencies, and environmental managers.

The UMU climate project (hereafter UMU-CP) first began during a
conversation between staff at the North Central Climate Adaptation
Science Center (NC CASC) and the UMU Environmental Department during a
site visit to Towaoc, CO, in December of 2019. The UMU-CP was designed
to support implementation of the recently completed UMU climate
adaptation plan ([UTE Mountain UTE Tribe,
2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref116))
by using both IK and WS to mainstream climate information into UMU
manager decision making processes. The project team includes the UMU
Climate Change Coordinator, NC CASC researchers, a USDA Forest Service
adaptation specialist, a non-profit scientist, and UMU natural resources
personnel. To date, the UMU-CP has entailed site visits, regular virtual
meetings, and a scenario planning workshop. Through these engagements,
the project has brought remote sensing analysis, IK, climate data, and
subject-matter expertise to bear on a climate-informed assessment of
ongoing and future UMU resource stewardship projects and planning.

### 2AC/1AR \-\-- Adaption Key 

#### We can only adapt to warming due to the global food production, water, and major environmental situations. 

Sahya **Maulu** et al, 12 March **2021** (PhD Researcher in fish
nutrition and health at the university of Plymouth (UK); Founding Board
Chairperson at Centre for Innovative Approach Zambia (CIAZ)

[[Climate change is now]{.mark} considered [a risk to global food
production and a major threat to the quality and quantity of
production]{.mark}]{.underline} (Beach and Viator, 2008; Hamdan et al.,
2015; Myers et al., 2017). Food security, particularly access to dietary
protein, is increasingly being threatened by the predicted effects of
climate change (Kandu, 2017). Climate change refers to variations that
occur in the statistical distribution of weather over extended periods,
typically ranging from decades to millions of years (Yazdi and Shakouri,
2010; IPCC, 2014). These variations may occur in the average weather or
simply in the distribution of weather events around an average, and may
be limited to a particular region, or occurring across the whole globe
(Yazdi and Shakouri, 2010). Humans have been recognized as the major
contributor to climate change through the use of fossil fuels (coal,
oil, and gas) for energy supplies (Doubleday et al., 2013; Environmental
Protection Agency, 2016; Gao et al., 2016; Barange et al., 2018; IPCC,
2019, Palmer and Stevens, 2019) as well as deforestation and forest
degradation (Khaine and Woo, 2015; Riphah, 2015) that emit greenhouse
gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. The increased accumulation of GHGs
including Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O), and
fluorinated gases in the atmosphere over the years has been linked to
these human activities. Already, climate change effects have been
reported on various key economic sectors and services globally (Troell
et al., 2017; IPCC, 2018; Cook and Zolnikov, 2019; FAO, 2020). [In
aquaculture, the majority of recent literature indicate that some
changes in climate, such as rising temperatures, changing precipitation
patterns, and increased frequency of some extreme events [are now
evident on water resources]{.mark}, while others are still
emerging]{.underline} (Fleming et al., 2014; Blanchard et al., 2017;
Troell et al., 2017; Zolnikov, 2019). Recently, climate change effects
on aquaculture sustainability have gained considerable interest owing to
the sector's significant contribution to global food security,
nutrition, and livelihoods (Blanchard et al., 2017; Dabbadie et al.,
2018; FAO, 2020). Despite some aspects of uncertainty, several
projections show that the entire aquaculture value chain is vulnerable
to the effects of climate change (Cochrane et al., 2009; Fleming et al.,
2014; Bueno and Soto, 2017; Barange et al., 2018; Dabbadie et al.,
2018). However, the majority of the available literature is largely
biased toward showing how climate change will affect aquaculture
production systems leaving, other stages in the value chain unclear
(Fleming et al., 2014). Such biases limit our current understanding of
the various extents to which the aquaculture sector will be affected.
Additionally, the absence of global models that can take into account
both the direct and indirect effects of climate change on aquaculture
makes the quantification of the effects difficult (Metian, 2017). What
is certain, however, is that the [[effects will be]{.mark} persistent
and likely to be [irreversible]{.mark}, resulting in severe consequences
on the economy of those engaged in the sector, with extreme effects
projected on poorer communities (IPCC).]{.underline} Climate
change-related risks to health, food security, livelihood, water supply,
human security, and economic development will increase under the
projected 1.5◦C global warming, with a further increase expected at 2◦C
(IPCC, 2018). In the face of such risks, both the industry and
communities will need to mitigate and adapt to the changing climate by
taking advantage of new opportunities emerging from altered resources
(Lorenzen et al., 2017). [Mitigation and [adaptation]{.mark} may [help
prepare the farming communities, ecosystems, and populations]{.mark}, in
general, [to build resilience]{.mark} and deal with climate change as
effectively and efficiently as possible (Zolnikov, 2019).]{.underline}
Mitigation focuses on reducing or reversing the rate of climate change
(Leal Filho, 2011; ACT, 2018). This involves mainly reducing GHGs
emission with a special focus on CO2 emissions which accounts for more
than 60% of human enhanced increases (Mohanty et al., 2010; IPCC, 2014;
Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). According to the IPCC (2018),
reductions in CO2 emissions may be achieved through a combination of new
and existing technologies and practices, including electrification,
hydrogen, sustainable bio-based feedstocks, product substitution, and
carbon capture utilization and storage. In aquaculture, producers and
other stakeholders may play a significant role in mitigating climate
change effects by making necessary adjustments in their production
practices aimed at minimizing the emission of GHGs. Specifically, this
includes the use of environmentally friendly practices and technology,
such as solar energy, proper feeding practices, and sustainable
wastewater management to minimize air and water pollution (VGREEN, 2012;
Barange et al., 2018). Feed production in aquaculture is particularly
seen as the sector's major contributor to GHG emissions (VGREEN, 2012).
For example, the use of sinking feeds is reported to be more
environmentally friendly compared with floating feeds (Hardy, 2010;
VGREEN, 2012). However, mitigation is a longterm solution to climate
change whose benefits may take a significant amount of time to be
realized (Elum et al., 2017; ACT, 2018). Besides, effective mitigation
requires collective action on a global scale since most GHGs accumulate
over time and mix globally, resulting in a global effect (IPCC, 2014).
Therefore, it is suggested that mitigation be implemented hand in hand
with adaption strategies for better and effective results (ACT, 2018;
IPCC, 2019). [[Adaptation]{.mark} focuses on [build]{.mark}ing
[resilience]{.mark} to the consequences, [and]{.mark} the capacity [to
utilize emerging opportunities sustainably and ethically]{.mark} (Bueno
and Soto, 2017).]{.underline} It involves making considerations in
advance, the expected changes, and taking those changes into account in
short-term decision making and long-range planning (Yazdi and Shakouri,
2010). Therefore, it can come in various forms, including technical
changes, changes in the behavior of resource users/producers, or changes
in the governance system (Lorenzen et al., 2017). Moreover, FAO (2018)
provides three target areas upon which successful adaptation
interventions may be centered, namely: institutions and management,
livelihood adaptation, and resilience and risk reduction. However, a
combination of these areas may most likely yield better results compared
to a single area focus looking at the strong link that exists among them
and their complementary action. [Currently, [adaptation is]{.mark} seen
as [the most viable option]{.mark} at the producers' disposal [to cope
with the effects of climate change on aquaculture]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Yazdi and Shakouri, 2010). Moreover, IPCC (2014) noted that [adaptation
experience to climate change effects continues to rise across regions in
both the public and private sectors, becoming more recognized and
included in developmental plans by several governments]{.underline}.
Furthermore, adaptation options that can also be used for mitigating GHG
emissions are more recommended since they can offer synergies that may
lead to reduced costs in many sectors (IPCC, 2018). Most importantly,
adaptation is not a onesize-fits-all situation, considering the dynamics
of vulnerability and exposure, and their linkage with the socio-economic
and sustainable development of various sectors (IPCC, 2014, 2018;
Clements and Chopin, 2016; Zolnikov, 2019). According to the IPCC
(2018), [successful adaptation in a changing climate will depend on the
adaptive capacity of the producers in a given nation or
region]{.underline}. For example, more severe effects have been
predicted on the producers in developing countries due to low adaptive
capacity (Figure 2) (Handisyde et al., 2017; Barange et al., 2018; IPCC,
2018; King and Harrington, 2018; Zolnikov, 2019). Although adaptation
options are more likely to be effective and sustainable if selected
according to a country's context and enabling environments (Bradley et
al., 2015; Blanchard et al., 2017; IPCC, 2018), we have highlighted some
options that may have a global application (Table 2).

####  Investing in adaptation is the key way to fight warming. 

The **U**nited **N**ations, **2025** (The United Nations: As the
world\'s only truly universal global organization, the United
Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend
national boundaries. "Adapting to the impacts of climate change" United

<https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/climate-adaptation> ) //BD

Climate change is here. A staggering [[3.6 billion
people]{.mark}](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/) ---
[nearly half of the global population]{.underline} ---
[**[are]{.underline}** **[currently highly vulnerable to climate change
impacts]{.underline}**]{.mark}, from droughts, floods and storms to heat
stress and food insecurity. [And this number will only continue to rise
as long as global temperatures keep climbing.]{.underline}

Beyond doing everything we can to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow
the pace of global warming, [[we must adapt to the unavoidable impacts
of climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**What can you do?**

There are many ways to adapt to what is happening and what will happen.
You can plant or preserve trees around your home, for instance, to keep
temperatures cooler inside. Clearing brush might reduce fire hazards. If
you own a business, start thinking about and planning around possible
climate risks, such as hot days that prevent workers from doing outside
tasks. Find out
more [here](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/verified-wikihow).

**Gearing up for big changes**

[[Our]{.mark} economies and [societies]{.mark} as a whole [need to
become more resilient]{.mark} to climate impacts]{.underline}. This will
require large-scale efforts, many of which will be orchestrated by
governments. Roads and bridges may need to be built or adapted to
withstand higher temperatures and more powerful storms. Some cities on
coastlines may have to establish systems to prevent flooding in streets
and underground transport. Mountainous regions may have to find ways to
limit landslides and overflow from melting glaciers.

**Spending now saves lives and reduces costs later on**

**[[Investing in adaptation makes]{.mark} a lot [more sense than waiting
and trying to catch up]{.mark} later.]{.underline} [[Protecting people
now saves more lives and reduces risks moving forward]{.mark}. It makes
financial sense too because [the longer we wait, the more the costs will
escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.underline}

Think about this. Globally, a \$1.8 trillion investment in early warning
systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved agriculture, global
mangrove protection along coastlines and resilient water resources could
generate [\$7.1
trillion](https://gca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GlobalCommission_Report_FINAL.pdf) through
a combination of avoided costs and a variety of social and environmental
benefits. Universal access to early warning systems can deliver benefits
up to 10 times the initial cost. And if more farms installed
solar-powered irrigation, used new crop varieties, had access to weather
alert systems and took other adaptive measures, [[the world would avoid
a drop-off]{.mark} in global agricultural yields [of]{.mark} up
to ]{.underline}[[30 per
cent]{.mark}](https://gca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GlobalCommission_Report_FINAL.pdf)[ by

#### Adaptation is key to climate survival 

**United Nations 24**, 1/30/24, international organization founded in
1945. Currently made up of 193 Member States, the UN and its work are
guided by the purposes and principles contained in its founding Charter,
United nations climate promise, What is climate change adaptation and
why is it crucial?,
<https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-climate-change-adaptation-and-why-it-crucial#:~:text=As%20the%20impacts%20of%20climate,that%20countries%20and%20communities%20adapt>
,AK

What is climate change adaptation?

Climate change [[adaptation refers to actions that]{.mark} help [reduce
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline} to the current or expected impacts of
climate change like weather extremes and hazards, sea-level rise,
biodiversity loss, or food and water insecurity. [Many [adaptation
measures]{.mark} [need to happen at the local level]{.mark}, so rural
communities and cities have a big role to play]{.underline}. Such
[measures include planting crop varieties that are more resistant to
drought and practicing regenerative agriculture, improving water storage
and use, managing land to reduce wildfire risks, and building stronger
defences against extreme weather like floods and heat
waves.]{.underline} However, [adaptation also needs to be driven at the
national and international level]{.underline}s. In addition to
developing the policies needed to guide adaptation, governments need to
look at large-scale measures such as strengthening or relocating
infrastructure from coastal areas affected by sea-level rise, building
infrastructure able to withstand more extreme weather conditions,
enhancing early warning systems and access to disaster information,
developing insurance mechanisms specific to climate-related threats, and
creating new protections for wildlife and natural ecosystems.

Why do we need to adapt? And why is it so urgent?

Scientific studies show that [[the Earth is]{.mark} now about [1.1°C
warmer]{.mark} than it was in the 1800]{.underline}s. This warming is
causing widespread and rapid changes in our planet's atmosphere, ocean
and ecosystems. [[As a result,]{.mark} weather and [climate
extremes]{.mark} [are]{.mark} becoming more frequent [in every
region]{.mark} of the world]{.underline}. According to climate models,
[without significant climate action, the world is headed
for]{.underline} 2.5 to [2.9°C temperature rise]{.underline} above
pre-industrial levels this century, which is well above the safety
limits established by scientists. [With every fraction of a degree of
warming, [the impacts of]{.mark} [climate change will become
more]{.mark} frequent and more [intense]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and
adaptation will become that much harder and more expensive for people
and ecosystems. [[The urgency is especially great for developing
countries]{.mark}, which are already feeling the impacts of climate
change and are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of
factors,]{.underline} including their geographical and climatic
conditions, their high dependence on natural resources, and their
limited capacity to adapt to a changing climate. [[Adaptation is]{.mark}
also [particularly important]{.mark} for]{.underline} women and young
children, older populations, ethnic minorities, [[Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}, refugees and displaced persons, who are
shown to be disproportionately affected by climate change. Even in very
positive scenarios in which we manage to significantly and swiftly cut
greenhouse gas emissions, [[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} change [[will
continue to impact our world]{.underline}]{.mark} for decades to come
[because of the energy already trapped in the system]{.underline}. This
means cutting down emissions is only one part of our response to the
climate crisis: [[adaptation is needed to limit the
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} and safeguard people and nature.

### 2AC \-\-- Warming Framing \-\-- Motivation (Adolescent Anxiety)

#### Talking about climate as if its existential puts kids through psychological abuse and physic violence

**Andrew Moseman 23**, MIT Climate Portal Writing Team, 11/7/23, Why do
some people call climate change an "existential threat"?, climate
portal,
https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-do-some-people-call-climate-change-existential-threat

As we continue to witness the impacts of the climate crisis, new terms
have emerged to describe the mental health and psychosocial consequences
of these changes, including "climate-" or "eco-anxiety".

[Climate anxiety can be described as]{.underline} heightened [emotional,
mental or physical distress in response to dangerous changes in the
climate.]{.underline}

[Climate anxiety represents]{.underline} real and valid [feelings of
fear, worry, stress, helplessness, and unease related to evolving
climate crises]{.underline}. These should be understood as natural
reactions when witnessing the impacts of climate change and not as a
mental health condition.

While these feelings are natural responses to a growing global crisis,
they can become concerning if they start to interfere with a child's
daily life. When climate anxiety begins to impact a child\'s functioning
at school, their friendships, or family relationships, it may be
important to seek professional support to help them manage these
feelings and maintain healthy development and well-being.

\>\> Read: Mental health conditions explained

1\. How can worries about climate change affect children's mental health
and well-being?

Caroline: [Concerns about climate change affect children and young
people in their daily physical life]{.underline} (eating, sleeping,
going to school etc.), their thinking (beliefs about the future) and
their feelings.

Children and young people are affected more than adults. They are still
developing physically and emotionally. [They are also impacted more
because climate change is affecting their whole future -- studying,
school and future careers.]{.underline}

They are dependent on adults, as they often have limited economic and
political power to directly influence action on climate change. Children
and young people need adults to support them in developing emotional
regulation and coping skills to manage their feelings. Their care for
the planet is not a diagnosis or a mental health issue, it is a positive
sign of mental health and awareness, reflecting their empathy and
responsibility toward environmental well-being. They only feel this
distress because they care. The key thing is that they need to be
listened to, and have their concerns taken seriously, and acted on.

\"[Many young people around the world are very worried about their
future on a warming planet.]{.underline}\"

Tshiamo: [Children under 13 years]{.underline}, especially those [who
have experienced]{.underline} or been exposed to the devastation caused
by [climate-related events]{.underline} like floods, wildfires, or
droughts, may [start worrying about such events happening]{.underline}
-- or happening again.

They may worry that the same events are going to happen to them, their
home, their pets, their teachers, their family and friends.

Younger children might struggle with separation from their parents in
fear that they may not come back for them.

This may affect their sleep, and some children may begin to have
nightmares about disasters. It may trigger fear of losing loved ones and
special places.

Such [anxieties can affect children\'s learning, play, and emotional
development]{.underline}, especially [when these fears are reinforced by
direct experience or awareness of nearby events]{.underline}.

[Adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18]{.underline} have better
reasoning compared to younger children, but they have easier access to
media showing climate change devastation around the world. They [are
able to identify the impact climate change is having]{.underline} in
their neighbourhoods and the world.

[This can trigger]{.underline} various [emotions including fear,
sadness, worry, anger and helplessness. Such emotions, when persistent,
can lead to anxiety among adolescents]{.underline}. This can affect
their concentration, sleep, eating habits, diet and relationships.

John: [Children and young people are particularly at-risk for climate
anxiety]{.underline}. Although climate anxiety is a natural and adaptive
response to the real and existential threats of climate crisis, climate
anxiety can cause depression, anxiety, and troubles sleeping, among
others, in young people. Many young people around the world are very
worried about their future on a warming planet.

### 2AC \-\-- Warming Framing \-\-- AT: Threat Multiplier

#### Framing climate change as a '[threat multiplier']{.underline} justifies [border control]{.underline}, [militarization]{.underline}, and promotes [racist]{.underline} portrayals of migrants as [security threats]{.underline}.

CIM = climate induced migration

[[ECD]{.mark} [assumes]{.mark} that [Climate Refugees]{.mark} will
[strain]{.mark} [resource]{.mark} stocks [and]{.mark} [cause]{.mark}
[conflict]{.mark} in receiving states]{.underline}.  ECD can be said to
[[portray]{.mark} Climate [Refugees as "referent subjects, the entity
that is]{.mark} [threatening]{.mark} \[[to]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[state]{.mark} which is\] the referent object, the entity that is
threatened]{.underline}" \[5\].  Framing CIM as a security threat
overlaps between immigration security and environmental security. 
Therefore, [[states]{.mark} seek to [justify]{.mark} [strengthening
border]{.mark} [management]{.mark} [and control regimes]{.mark} to
prevent waves of so called 'Climate Refugees']{.underline} from entering
their territories. Climate Refugees are thus [viewed as a threat to
national security requiring the **state**, **the securitizing actor**,
to securitize ClM as a way to keep Climate Refugees in their countries
of origin.]{.underline}

ECD coupled with the degradation narrative provides the assumption that
Climate Refugees can cause the same resource pressure on receiving
states that pushed them to migrate in the first place; therefore,
Climate Refugees are seen as a threat and an inevitable source of
conflict in the territory of the receiving state. Abel *et. al* (2019)
argues that CIM leads to conflict in refugee receiving states asserting
that "the arrival of climate migrants can put pressure on
infrastructure, services and the economy of the receiving area, leading
to competition over resources, especially when the resources are scarce"
\[6\]. These arguments would align with the ECD, but ECD narratives
[[lack ev]{.mark}idence [to]{.mark} [support]{.mark} the claims that a
[link]{.mark} exists [between climate change, migration and
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Brzoska and Fröhlich (2016) highlighted
that "[there is [no]{.mark} [scientific]{.mark} [study]{.mark} that has
empirically established the links between climate change, conflict and
migration]{.underline} and identifies the causal pattern in a convincing
manner, partly due to the inherent complexity of the task"\[7\].

The Imaginative Geographies of Fear and the Securitization of Climate
Induced Migration

ECDs arguably lack widespread evidence to support the claim of a direct
nexus that exists between Climate Change, resource scarcity, conflict
and migration. However, ECD has played a substantial role in the
narratives that inform the imaginative geographies of fear about Climate
Refugees[. [It]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the **[imaginative geographies of
fear]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} have [informed]{.mark} [policies]{.mark}
[to securitize CIM]{.mark} in the Global North]{.underline}. The
imaginative geographies of fear describe

the ways in which other places, peoples, cultures, and landscapes are
represented in discourse and action by another group. The imaginative
geographies produced---whether conversations, art, media reporting,
travel writing, academic articles, intelligence reports---reflect the
preconceptions and desires of their creators, and are reflective of the
power between these authors and the subjects of their imaginings \[8\]

[In Western countries]{.underline}, particularly after 9/11, [there has
been the ease in which "foreigners]{.underline}, described in various
different ways (migrant, refugee, etc.), \[are\] [added to insecurity
discourse, with the effect of heightening the perceived seriousness of
\[their\] threat]{.underline}" \[9\]. Climate Refugees from the Global
South have not been an exception to the threat narratives because ECD
links their arrival in receiving states to conflict and instability. It
is [this imaginative [fear]{.mark} [that "**black** and **brown
bodies**]{.mark} [crossing]{.mark} national [borders]{.mark}" \[10\]
will [inevitably]{.mark} [lead to conflict]{.mark} that causes
[states]{.mark}, especially those in the Global North to [view]{.mark}
their **mobile [bodies]{.mark}** [as inherent
**threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Baldwin and Erickson (2020) provide an
explanation to the imaginative fear of 'black and brown bodies as
threatening by arguing that the Anthropocene is 'inescapably racial' and
that it is a "white public space': a space which 'erases the
differential histories and relationships that have led to current
environmental crises" \[11\]. [The **[racialization]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [climate induced migration]{.mark} [omits]{.mark} the
[destructive]{.mark} [impact]{.mark} that [colonization]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [capitalism]{.mark} [have]{.mark} had on the environment.
\[12\]]{.underline}

According to White (2011) "Securitization is an active process, - one
that identifies a threat, specifies its character, taps into a "social
imaginary" of fear, and crafts a response that is robust and effective
in enhancing safety" \[13\]. ECD has played a role in the 'social
imaginary fears' about CIM. ECD purports that Climate Change cause's
resource scarcity which subsequently and inevitably leads to conflict
and migration and it builds the assumption that Climate Refugees will
transfer these insecurities across borders as they move. In addition,
when ECD is understood alongside the environmental degradation narrative
these discourses cast an image of millions of poverty-stricken Climate
Refugees fleeing their countries of origins to escape climate induced
conflict caused by resource scarcity. Climate Refugees are seen as
harbingers of insecurity who will likely induce resource scarcity and
conflict in the receiving states of the Global North. Chaturvedi and
Doyle argued that "as imaginative geographies of threatening incremental
climate change seek embodiment in the figure of a 'climate migrant',
[[new]{.mark} [walls/borders of otherness]{.mark} (both mental and
physical) [are]{.mark} being [erected]{.mark} [and]{.mark} in the
process, the [old]{.mark} [ones]{.mark} are
**[reinforced]{.mark}**]{.underline}" \[14\]. ECD is also very
state-centric so its discursive power taps into the imaginative
geographies of fears about the perceived threat of Climate Refugees to
state security. In this regard, it can be said that "imaginative
geographies are often deployed at the service of power- political-
policing practices of the institutions of statecraft" \[15\]. ECD helps
to fortify imaginative geographies of fears about Climate Refugees into
a tool for the state to justify securitizing CIM.

### 1AR \-\-- Warming Framing \-\-- Ext.

#### Framing climate change as existential detracts from real world suffering and portrays tech as a 'holy grail' that allows for the [continuing]{.underline} degradation of the biosphere.

Science, Technology, and Society at Virginia Tech; "Beyond the Climate
Change Crisis: A Critique of Climate Change Discourse."; Telos; Winter

But the [[dominant framing of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}---its
identification as the most urgent problem that we face---all but bluntly
[[declares]{.mark} that the [sky is]{.mark}
[falling]{.mark}.]{.underline} The apocalyptic potential of global
warming in the not-so-distant future manifests between the lines of
climate-change writings far more vividly than mere subtext. The
difference between such climate-change characterizations (quoted
earlier) as "collapse of civilization" or "planetary emergency," on the
one hand, and the idea of apocalypse, on the other, is almost purely
semantic. Climate-change works do not employ the word apocalypse, but
they often imply or outright describe something that uncannily resembles
what religious imagery has pictured. Ross Gelbspan, for example, in a
description fairly typical of what climate change foreshadows, writes of
"the world becoming a storm-battered, insect-infested breeding ground of
infectious diseases," one "of temperature extremes, of extensive drought
and desperate heat."48

The Revenge of Gaia may be the most openly apocalyptic work on global
warming in print. Lovelock assesses all variables affecting climate as
being in positive feedback, which indicates, in his words, that "any
addition of heat from any source will be amplified."49 Among positive
feedbacks, he lists loss of albedo from the melting of polar ice,
decline of carbon-dioxide-absorbing and cloud-producing plankton, and
the release of land-locked and (possibly) sea-bottom methane---all
consequences of increasing temperatures, which, in turn, will act to
reinforce and accelerate "global heating." Any one of these feedbacks
might raise concern, but considered together an alarming picture emerges
for Lovelock. He predicts runaway heating: "The evidence coming in from
the watchers of the world," he claims, "brings news of an
[[imminent]{.mark} [shift]{.mark} [in]{.mark} our [climate towards one
that can]{.mark} easily [be described as Hell]{.mark}:]{.underline} so
hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive
will survive."50 This forecast proceeds from the apprehension of
overstepping Earth-system thresholds and unleashing consequences both
deadly and uncontrollable: in the climate-change literature, exceeding
such thresholds is referred to as "dangerous anthropogenic
interference."

While the specific forecast of a Hell in which billions perish is at the
extreme end of climate-change predictions, the general intimation of a
looming calamity for large numbers of people, and for civilization
itself, is widespread in the literature. Overt or oblique,
[[apocalyptic]{.mark} [intimations]{.mark} [abound]{.mark} in
climate-change discourse.]{.underline} The concept of apocalypse is not
just a household idea, but it is so in the air today (with
fundamentalisms of all stripes and their ideas in full swing) that
explicit reference to an impending apocalypse is redundant for the
audience of climate-change writings. [[Dire]{.mark} [warnings]{.mark}
about the consequences of the continued use of fossil fuels, coupled
with images of rising seas, soaring heat waves, raging wildfires,
rampant disease, and acidified oceans, [suffice to vividly evoke an
end-ofthe-world]{.mark} [vision]{.mark}]{.underline} circulated for two
millennia by Judeo-Christian culture.

Apocalyptic thinking manifests in a three-fold narrative structure
pertaining to the timing, nature, and consequences of expected events if
greenhouse-gas emissions continue unabated: one, an Earth-shattering
calamity is forecast (or insinuated) to arrive at a future, albeit
unspecified, time; two, it is nebulously portrayed as a single
monumental catastrophe (adumbrated, perhaps, by a string of
interconnected lesser catastrophes) that will affect everyone and
everything; and three, it is suggested that human survival and the
viability of civilization are at stake, with unprecedented levels of
death, suffering, and social breakdown anticipated.

Whether or not apocalyptic admonitions are tracking an immanent reality,
and the world is actually headed for the hellish heat and anomie that
Lovelock fears, climate change as apocalypse can be censured for playing
straight into the hands of the religious fundamentalisms that are
menacing the world. Indeed, the apocalyptic narratives of climate-change
literature align closely with prophetic claims strewn throughout the Old
and New Testaments.51 A perverse and noteworthy consequence of the
alignment between climate-change and biblical imagery is that many
fundamentalists (politicians, decision-makers, or citizens) may well
remain undeterred and unmoved by climate-change warnings, which only
resonate with their visions of death-by-fire, on the one hand, and
rapture, on the other. As Derrick Jensen observes about this disturbing
element at play today, "to many fundamentalists, the killing of the
planet is not something to be avoided but encouraged, hastening as it
does the victory of God over all things earthly."52
[[Apocalyptic]{.mark} [warnings]{.mark} [dovetail into]{.mark} the
day-of-reckoning [fantasies]{.mark} [of those who]{.mark} seem to [care
little about]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [biosphere's destiny]{.mark}; and
while their fantasies may not be widely held beliefs, they
[possess]{.mark} a sort of de facto [credibility]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
virtue of their sheer [cultural]{.mark}
[ubiquity]{.mark}]{.underline}.53

Narrative affinity with biblical stories is the least problematic aspect
of [[representing]{.mark} the [climate crisis as near-future
apocalypse]{.mark}]{.underline}. The most pernicious dimension of this
representation is that of [[occluding]{.mark} the [reality we
are]{.mark}]{.underline} (and have been) [[immersed]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
here and [now]{.mark}]{.underline}---namely, the
simplification-cum-homogenization of life on Earth. Climate change is
not causing, but is hastening, the running down of the planet, and [[the
tech]{.mark}nological [grail that might ultimately solve the climate
crisis will]{.mark}, more likely than not, [simply]{.mark}
[allow]{.mark} the [business-as-usual **unraveling** of the biosphere to
**proceed**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Besides coddling humanity's proclivity for self-centered concern,
[apocalyptic thinking [directs attention toward some future
Hollywoodstyle cataclysm]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [[dimming awareness
of the present and real suffering of]{.mark}]{.underline} nonhumans,
[[disempowered]{.underline}]{.mark} and impoverished
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}, and consumers beleaguered by clutter and
malaise. [[Life's ongoing devastation]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
humanity's pathological imbalance with wild nature and schisms within
itself, [[are]{.mark} [the predicaments]{.mark} that we are called to
face---[not]{.mark} the preemption of [some imagined]{.mark}
[crash]{.mark} in some imagined future.]{.underline}

Growing world political tensions have a profound impact on land use in
Sápmi, the traditional homeland region of the Indigenous Sámi people
which stretches across Northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola
peninsula in Russia1. [[Climate change has increased interest in the
economic, extractive, logistical and military exploitation of the Arctic
region]{.mark} already for some time, but today, land use and
development in Sápmi is also reshaped by new acute security and defence
imaginaries]{.underline}. This is reflected in Sweden and Finland's NATO
memberships and in the fact that each Nordic state that comprise Sápmi
has now signed a bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) with the
United States[. [As global geopolitical and Nordic state interests in
the Arctic keep rising, the region gets imagined in]{.mark} increasingly
[colonial terms]{.mark} -- a vast or empty space that can secure not
just national needs for security and natural resources but also those of
the EU and the West at large, whether in terms of the green energy
transition, critical mineral self-sufficiency, or military build-up and
training for Arctic warfare. [These developments present a]{.mark}
considerable [challenge for the Sámi.]{.mark} On one hand, [increasing
extractive, industrial and military land use is exacerbating the
colonial appropriation of their lands, eradicating the material basis of
Indigenous Sámi culture and livelihoods and putting their Indigenous
rights and future at risk. ]{.mark}]{.underline}On the other hand, the
ongoing land-grab in Sápmi is justified in national and international
discourse increasingly in reference to 'common good', such as saving the
planet from climate change or the need to boost national, EU and NATO
defence against foreign aggression. In this context, voicing Sámi
concerns for their own rights, security and future as Sámi becomes
increasingly difficult, as such concerns are easily sidelined by the
majority society as less relevant, or even standing in the way of the
security of all.

### 2AC/1AR \-\-- Warming Framing \-\-- Militarization 

#### Climate securitization is based in a [racialized]{.underline} logic that justifies [militarization]{.underline} to solve eco-crisis, [exacerbating]{.underline} eco-crises.

In the Global North, "[[climate]{.mark} [security]{.mark}]{.underline}"
has become a [[dominant]{.mark} [frame]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[thinking]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
[thinking]{.mark}---[about]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark}
crisis.]{.underline}

The framing assumes that climate change will disrupt weather and
environmental systems, putting pressure on economic and social systems
as well as natural resources, leading to large-scale displacement; all
of this is expected to create instability, to worsen tensions and create
new ones, and to increase the threat of violent conflicts. Though views
within this framing rarely claim that climate change is the sole cause
of conflict, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[see]{.mark}
[climate]{.mark} change [as ushering in]{.mark} "an era of
[persistent]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark}... a security environment much
more ambiguous and unpredictable than that faced during the Cold
War."]{.underline} Climate change is [[framed]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a
"[threat multiplier]{.mark}]{.underline}," driving insecurity and
violence, particularly across the Global South. While this [body of
[research]{.mark}]{.underline} points to very real and worsening
problems, it also [[pulls]{.mark} attention and [resources]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} [addressing]{.mark} the [**causes** of the climate crisis
and]{.mark} the [**necessary solutions**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is critical to note, however, that [the "[security]{.mark}" that is
[of]{.mark} most [concern]{.mark} in this framing [is threats to]{.mark}
the security of powerful [states]{.mark} in the Global
North]{.underline}, and "security" is [taken to mean the [ability to
defend]{.mark} not only their state [borders]{.mark}, but also their
political, [economic]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [military]{.mark}
[dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}. The privileging of this narrative stems
in part from the fact that Global North departments of defense typically
have far more power and resources, particularly when it comes to
international interventions, than those governing development or the
environment. But it goes beyond institutional power and resources. We
can only fully explain the privileging of security institutions and
framings (especially their influence on the climate crisis) and the grip
they have on the popular imagination by paying attention to gender.

Indeed, securitization is a gendered dynamic. It is the [process of
situating issues in the military sphere]{.underline}, which is itself
rendered "serious" and "realistic" by ideas about gender. For
generations, the idea that militaries are the most effective means of
achieving security has been naturalized by its association with [ideas
about
masculinity](https://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/Cohn_-_Gender_and_National_Security.pdf):
that strength is defined by being able to protect oneself using physical
force; that bullies only understand force; that vulnerability invites
attack; that security requires impenetrable borders; and so on. This
association of manliness with a militarized conception of national
identity and national security helps make militaries, military spending,
and military solutions seem like the superior, realistic, natural, and
obvious routes to achieving security. Conversely, any potential refusal
to privilege them is feminized, marking alternative ways of thinking as
weak and unrealistic; consider US Ambassador Nikki Haley framing her
opposition to discussing a nuclear weapons ban this way: "As a mom, as a
daughter, there is nothing I want more for my family than a world with
no nuclear weapons. But we have to be realistic." [Ideas about gender
**naturalize** militarized conceptions of security and securitization
itself, helping render the "**[climate]{.mark} [security]{.mark}"**
framework as the most powerful and realistic way of addressing the
climate crisis.]{.underline}

Yet there are multiple problems in this gendered "climate security"
framing, as well as dangers with the overall securitization of the
climate crisis. First, it [[centers]{.mark} a [vision]{.mark} of the
world [from]{.mark} the perspective of [Northern]{.mark}
[elites]{.mark}, which [locates]{.mark} [climate change]{.mark} threats
[as coming from "out there"]{.mark}]{.underline}[---]{.mark}from its
victims, from outsiders, from people in Global South countries where the
violence that threatens "stability" will supposedly occur, and from
where displaced people will supposedly be trying to
flee---[[instead]{.mark} [of]{.mark} correctly [locating]{.mark} the
[threats]{.mark} to the planet [as]{.mark} [coming from the Global
North]{.mark} countries, [militaries]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[corporations]{.mark} that are actually the most responsible for
it.]{.underline}

Second, it is a [framing that [leads to a militarized
response]{.mark}]{.underline}, which justifies [[increases in
budgets]{.mark} of military and other "security"
institutions]{.underline}, [[capturing]{.mark} the [resources]{.mark} we
[need]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [solve]{.mark} the climate and wider
[ecological]{.mark} [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. It further compounds
the problem by [fostering and legitimating the [expansion]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [military]{.mark} training and
operations]{.underline}---thereby [[increasing]{.mark} their vast use of
[fossil fuels]{.mark} and other forms of environmental
degradation---[making]{.mark} the climate and [eco-crises
**worse**,]{.mark} not better.]{.underline}

Third, it sets up preservation of the status quo as the goal, whereas
dealing with the climate crisis requires massive changes to the status
quo. This is especially so if the countries that are least responsible
for carbon emissions, and where those most affected live, are ever going
to get access to the resources they need to respond.

Fourth, and perhaps the most devastating, is that, if our intention is
to head off the worst of climate change and even try to reverse it,
framing the climate crisis as a security crisis completely misdirects
our attention. [The climate crisis is not a crisis of security; it is
a crisis of extractivist capitalism,]{.underline} an economic system
that [incentivizes the exploitation of natural resources as if they were
unlimited and "externalizes" the environmental costs of
production]{.underline}---from pollution to the release of greenhouse
gases. Through its dependence on fossil fuels for cheap energy and
industrial agriculture that overexploits soil and water supplies,
extractivist capitalism champions growth at all costs, including the
destruction of the environment. [Its neoliberal insistence on
"liberating" markets and denouncing regulation and collective action has
made it impossible to take the actions needed to **halt** climate
breakdown.]{.underline}

And it misdirects our attention because the [[climate crisis is not a
crisis of security; it is a crisis of]{.mark} a [white]{.mark}
[western]{.mark} masculinist [framing of the relation between]{.mark}
[**humanity** and **nature**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, it is a
crisis that is a reflection of western, white, male-dominated
philosophical and religious traditions, in which man has been seen as
separate from and independent of nature, his proper role to dominate
"her" and bend her to his will. As Indigenous peoples,
environmentalists, and feminists around the world have long argued, this
is a fundamental misunderstanding of humanity's relation to the rest of
nature. It fails to recognize that not only do we need to take care of
nature, but that nature takes care of us, that we are part of nature,
that nature has agency, that humankind is just one species among many on
this planet, and that our fundamental relationship to the
more-than-human world is one of complex interdependence and reciprocity.

To say that the climate crisis is a crisis of extractivist capitalism,
and the western masculinist mindset that underpins it, is not to ignore
that the climate crisis will cause tremendous "insecurity" in people's
lives. But that word abstracts, misnames and erases the reality. The
climate crisis will cause more people to go hungry; more children to be
malnourished, their growth and capacities stunted. More people will
drown in floods, typhoons, and hurricanes, or burn to death in
wildfires, while others will only have the places they live destroyed.
More people will lose their only means of livelihood, as the plants,
animals, and ecosystems that have been part of their material survival
and cultural identity for generations perish. Many more will be uprooted
from the territories of their ancestors and communities that sustain
them because those places have become unlivable; others will sicken, be
disabled, and die from infectious diseases new to their areas, to which
they have no immunity. And a lack of resources---a result of grotesque
global inequality---will prevent untold numbers from escaping or
protecting themselves and the people they love from any of these
impacts.

T[hat is not insecurity; it is a human and species-wide disaster of
catastrophic scale, and the answer cannot be to "secure," to "enhance
security," or to talk of "climate-related security risks." If we
misname, and misunderstand, what this is a crisis of, we will
misunderstand what we need to do to try to fix it.]{.underline}

I write this essay to express an issue I have with how the
[[Anthropocene]{.underline}]{.mark} period is sometimes
[[described]{.mark} [through]{.mark}]{.underline} dystopian or
[**[postapocalyptic]{.mark}** [narratives]{.mark} of climate crises that
will leave humans in horrific **science-fiction**
scenarios]{.underline}. Such [narratives]{.underline} can
[**[erase]{.mark}** [Indigenous]{.mark} peoples' [perspectives]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the [connections]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark} [and **colonial violence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
addressing this issue here, I will cover topics including climate
justice, Indigenous philosophy, and allyship. The essay unfolds in three
independent sections without a conclusion section. Though independent,
the sections overlap with and refer to one another.

The first section, ''Ancestral Dystopias and Climate Change Crises,''
shows some of the ways in which [[Indigenous]{.mark} [peoples]{.mark}
[challenge **linear narratives**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} dreadful futures of
[climate]{.mark} [destabilization]{.mark} with their own accounts of
history that [highlight]{.mark} the [reality of **constant
change**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [emphasize]{.mark} [colonialism's
role]{.mark} in environmental change]{.underline}. The second section,
''Indigenous Science (Fiction),'' develops an account of Indigenous
narrative-making using a conception of spiraling time that can be seen
as living science fiction, and helps to explain certain aspects of
Indigenous artistic production and Indigenous environmental conservation
and environmental justice work. The third section, ''Allies and
Ancestral Fantasies,'' is a critique of some of the ways in which
scholars and advocates (i.e. allies) who seek to empower Indigenous
peoples do so by denying their connections to the worlds many of their
ancestors established today---worlds their ancestors would have
fantasized about.

This essay is a speculative account that seeks to engage philosophical
and aesthetic places that honor Indigenous histories, perspectives and
projects (i.e., activism, work, research, etc.) and that support
constructive and critical conversations of allyship.

Ancestral dystopias and climate change crises

Some people see the Anthropocene as a coming period of irreversible
destabilization of the global climate system---an impending [climate
crisis]{.underline}. Academics, journalists, and artists have
[[conjured]{.mark} [apocalyptic]{.mark}]{.underline} and dystopian
[[portrayals]{.mark} [of **perilous** futures]{.mark} of mass species
extinctions, ecosystem degradation and social upheaval]{.underline}
(Cafaro and Primack, 2014; Methmann and Rothe, 2012; Mitchell, 2016;
Skrimshire, 2010). In fiction portrayals, Whyte 225 ranging from The
Bone Clocks to Carbon Diaries 2017, [climate futures are dystopian times
of rationing, government assistance, major **extinctions**, social
unrest, drastic measures, and **defaced landscapes**]{.underline}
(Ignatius, 2014; Lloyd, 2011; Mitchell, 2014). Joni Adamson cites a
trend for speculative fiction to be written and used by academics to
address dreaded futures tied to ''climate change'' and ''global
ecological transformations'' (Adamson, 2016: 216[). In the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ation[s' deliberations on climate
change, logics of apocalypse are present through [discourses]{.mark} [of
climate change as ''**catastrophic''**]{.mark}]{.underline} and akin to
''two world wars'' (Methmann and Rothe, 2012). Audra Mitchell observes
growing references to the thought that climate change could be a factor
leading to the extinction of all humans (Mitchell, 2016: 27). Scholar,
writer, and artist Leanne Simpson, who recently authored the book As We
Have Always Done, observes how ''.. focusing on imminent ecological
collapse is motivating Canadians to change if you look at the spectrum
of climate change denial across society. It is spawning a lot of
apocalypse movies\...'' (Klein, 2013; Simpson, 2017).1 Janet Fiskio's
(2012) study confirms Simpson's observations, showing that in
literature, activism and the media ''the narratives employed to describe
climate change are familiar: apocalyptic visions inflected by utopian,
dystopian, and millenarian imaginaries drawn from speculative fiction,
disaster films, and biblical texts'' (Fiskio, 2012: 13). In an article
titled, ''Climate Change is So Dire We Need a New Kind of Science
Fiction to Make Sense of It,'' Claire Evans writes that ''we need an
Anthropocene fiction. Since sci-fi mirrors the present, ecological
collapse requires a new dystopian fiction\... a form of science fiction
that tackles the radical changes of our pressing and strange
reality\...'' (Evans, 2015).

As a Potawatomi scholar and activist, I feel that [[Indigenous]{.mark}
[peoples]{.mark} [do]{.mark} [not]{.mark} always [share]{.mark} quite
the same science fiction **[imaginaries]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[dystopian]{.mark} or apocalyptic [futures when they confront
the]{.mark} possibility of a [climate crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Whyte, 2017b). Candis Callison, relating to Arctic Indigenous peoples,
writes that we need to recognize what ''[climate change portends for
those who have endured a century of immense cultural, political and
environmental changes'']{.underline} (Callison, 2014: 42). Callison's
work recognizes that [[the]{.mark} [hardships]{.mark} many
[nonIndigenous people dread]{.mark} most of the climate crisis [are ones
that Indigenous peoples have **endured**]{.mark}]{.underline} already
[due to different forms of colonialism: ecosystem collapse, species
loss, economic crash, drastic relocation, and cultural
disintegration.]{.underline}

In my many conversations in the last several years with Preston
Hardison, a policy analyst for the Tulalip Tribes and advocate of the
protection of Indigenous knowledge, we often discuss how for many
Indigenous peoples, the loss of local access to a culturally or
economically significant plant or animal due to colonial domination is
comparable to that species becoming extinct (Hardison, 2017). [Different
forms of colonialism]{.underline}, of course, whether through
environmental destruction, land dispossession or forced relocation, have
[ended Indigenous peoples' local relationships to thousands of plants,
animals, insects, and entire ecosystems.]{.underline} While these
relationships often continue to be enacted through Indigenous peoples'
living memories, heritage, ''felt knowledges'' (Million, 2013), social
identities (e.g., clans), and philosophies, they have stopped as
relationships involving direct ecological interaction. As Audra
Mitchell's research shows, today's [[global]{.mark} [discourses]{.mark}
[of extinction]{.mark} are often so focused on ''species'' that they
[**cannot come to grips** with]{.mark} Indigenous peoples' experiences
of having their relationships with nonhumans **greatly disrupted** by
[colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2016).

[Some [Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, then, offer the idea that we
[confront climate change having already passed through]{.mark}
environmental and climate crises arising from the impacts of
colonialism]{.underline}. Robin Kimmerer often tells the story of one of
the Potawatomi relocation processes from the Great Lakes region to
Kansas and Oklahoma in the 19th century. The relocation process was
literally a drastic change in climate regions and the ending of many
ancient relationships with the species and ecosystems of Potawatomi
homelands. Reflecting 226 Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space
1(1--2) on today's climate crisis as the experience of de´ja\` vu,
Kimmerer says ''Once again, we are in a situation of forced climate
change adaptation'' (Kimmerer, 2014). Dan Wildcat claims that
[Indigenous vulnerability to climate change today is part of previous
removals occurring as part of U.S. **colonial** expansion:]{.underline}
''geographic'' (displacement, e.g., Trail of Tears and the forced
occupation of reservations); ''social'' and ''psychocultural'' (such as
through removal of children to boarding schools) (Wildcat, 2009: 4).
Leanne Simpson discusses how ''Indigenous peoples have always been able
to adapt, and we've had a resilience. But the speed of this---our
stories and our culture and our oral tradition doesn't keep up, can't
keep up\... [**Colonial thought** brought us climate
change'']{.underline} (Klein, 2013). In the epigraph, Sheila
Watt-Cloutier, a former chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and
recent author of the Right to Be Cold, discusses in an interview how
''Climate change is yet another rapid assault on our way of life. It
cannot be separated from the first waves of changes and assaults at the
very core of the human spirit that have come our way'' (Robb, 2015;
Watt-Cloutier, 2015).

In light of what was said in the previous paragraph, it should not be
surprising that [Indigenous persons see our current situation as already
having been through a crisis that is ongoing]{.underline}. Lee Sprague,
known most recently for his organizing the Michigan Cold Water Canoe
Rescue at Standing Rock, says that we already inhabit what our ancestors
would have understood as a dystopian future (Sprague, 2017; Whyte,
2017b). Larry Gross writes that ''Native Americans have seen the end of
their respective worlds\... Indians survived the apocalypse'' (Gross,
2014, 33). Sprague's and Gross' framing of today's times comes out in
Indigenous science fiction expression. Grace Dillon interprets
[Indigenous futurisms]{.underline} in literature and the arts [as
expressing how [Indigenous]{.mark} [peoples]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
currently [living]{.mark} [in a ''**postNative**
Apocalypse'']{.mark}]{.underline} (Dillon, 2012: 10). Building on
Dillon's research, Conrad Scott's recent study discusses how
''Indigenous literature, following the culturally destructive process of
colonial European advancement and absorption of what is now called the
Americas, tends to narrate a sense of ongoing crisis rather than an
upcoming one'' (Scott, 2016: 77).

[Indigenous peoples then **[do]{.mark} [not]{.mark}** always
[approach]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark} crisis [as]{.mark} an
**[impending future]{.mark}** to be dreaded]{.underline}. Heather Davis
and Zoe Todd see an insidious irony in the different ways Indigenous and
nonIndigenous persons approach the Anthropocene and climate crisis. They
describe [colonialism as a seismic shockwave that ''kept rolling like a
slinky \[as it worked\] to compact and speed up time, laying waste to
legal orders, languages, place-story in quick succession. The fleshy,
violent loss of 50 million Indigenous peoples in the Americas is
something we read as a 'quickening' of space-time in a **seismic
sense**'']{.underline} (Davis and Todd, 2017: 771--772). They then point
out that ''the Anthropocene or at least all of the anxiety produced
around these realities for those in Euro-Western contexts---is really
the arrival of the reverberations of that seismic shockwave into the
nations who introduced colonial, capitalist processes across the globe
in the first half-millennium in the first place'' (Davis and Todd, 2017:
774).2

The perspectives referenced in the last few paragraphs point to the idea
that [Indigenous peoples have already endured harmful and rapid
environmental transformations due to [colonialism]{.mark} and other
forms of domination]{.underline}. As Davis and Todd articulate so
clearly, these environmental transformations---''[the fleshy violent
\[losses\]]{.underline}''---[[seem]{.mark} actually [a lot like
what]{.mark} many [other]{.mark} [people]{.mark} in the world [fear will
happen with climate destabilization]{.mark} when these same people
portray apocalyptic]{.underline} and dystopian science fiction
[futures]{.underline}.3 Given Indigenous experiences of, scholarly work
on and testimonies about colonialism, it should not be hard to imagine
why many Indigenous persons I know do not accept historical narratives
that privilege the idea that climate change and the Anthropocene raise
the issue of how to understand and stop a dreaded future movement from
stability to crisis. Consider a brief history of Anishinaabe/Neshnabe´
peoples, who include diverse Ojibwe, Odawa, Whyte 227 Potawatomi,
Mississauga and other peoples whose homelands are in the Great Lakes
region but also, through relocation, in places such as Oklahoma, Kansas,
and North Dakota.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED: NONE OMITTED\>\>

As the events discussed above exemplify, [**[air-terror]{.mark}** of
**aggressive noise** might have been spheric and [capable of
**transforming** the **atmosphere**]{.mark} at the moment, yet without
being able to **significantly** alter **enactments**. Such atmospheric
**transformation** was not simply passing through [bodies]{.mark}
**without noticing**]{.underline}; it was rather embodied by [taking a
long breathe that [drained empty its **sonic
terror**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When I returned to discuss the events
later on, one villager stated that 'we need to stay strong' and 'not to
let these things to get under our skin'. It is precisely such
indifference, the 'need to stay strong', that hides a key ambiguity. On
the one hand, the momentary attunement to [indifference constitutes
something **rechannelling** the atmospheric violence of **sonic
terror**]{.underline}. Though incorporating the everyday and changing
the atmosphere on the spot, the noise was nevertheless pushed back to
the background. On the other hand, it is precisely through these
indifferences that the atmospheric also did channel attunement. The
manifoldness of becoming attuned, in other words, brings to the fore an
ambiguity at the heart of sphere-dwelling: it testifies how spheric
violence can be engendered through negating sound-spheres that channel
attunements and re/inactions, while simultaneously underlining the
inability of the spheric to dictate what it so catalyses. Spheric
weaponisations, in short, constitute bodies without being able to reduce
them to their coercive functions and terrorising attunements. It is
precisely this 'inability to reduce' that I argue signifies, not only
the 'ungovernability of the body' (Joronen and Griffiths, 2022), but
crucially also the incapacity of the spheric. To a certain extent,
bodies are always vulnerable to atmospheric alterations: they are
constituted in and through the spheric and its atmospheric
(material/affective) compositions. And yet, vulnerability never
signifies a mere vulnerability to spheric, but also a vulnerability of
the spheric: namely, [the incapacity of the [atmospheric
**weaponisations**]{.mark} to orchestrate life to what it
[conjures]{.mark} as its ambient surroundings. It is precisely for this
reason that the focus in studying inhabitation of air should remain, not
only on those ways through which the spheric **constitutes bodies**, but
on those [irreducible **vulnerabilities** through]{.mark} [which
bodies]{.mark} [become **attuned**]{.mark} to atmospheres]{.underline}
(see also Bille and Simonsen, 2021). The body, and its irreducibility to
negating spheres, becomes a key entry point through which to understand
sphere-dwelling as inexhaustible to, and yet constituted through spheric
configurations of violence. Such is not simply a sign of the
vulnerability of the body to the spheres it remains exposed to; it also
offers a window for thinking the fragility and incapacity of the
spheric. Sphere-dwelling, in this regard, denotes reciprocal
vulnerability of bodies and spheres. Groundless air: On negative
condition of sphere-dwelling As the discussion so far has shown,
sphere-dwelling names a reciprocal vulnerability between the body and
the spheric. It is this negative condition of inhabiting the air -- the
vulnerability of/to spheric -- [that **atmospheric weaponisations
mobilise** without being able to fully [exhaust bodies to their
**violent orderings**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this last section, I want
to think further on the onto-political ramifications of such prevalence
of the negative in sphere-dwelling. I will do so by asking what the
atmospheric negations discussed above, with their disruptive,
contaminating, marking, amputating, disorienting, repulsive,
humiliating, and incapacitating functions, can unfold about the material
and affective aspects of inhabiting the air. My aim is to open up a
space for thinking the ramifications of atmospheric negations,
particularly the questions of vulnerability and irreducibility they were
shown to instigate, through what I call the breathing of groundless air.
I will do so by problematising three ontological aspects that over the
last 20 years or so have become paradigmatic for approaching
materiality, affect and politics in geographical literature (and
beyond): namely, relationality, vitality and affirmation. While
acknowledging that these aspects do not always travel together (see Mol,
2013; cf. Coole and Frost, 2010; Ojakangas, 2005) and that they do carry
versatile, even opposing takes within (see Bridge, 2020; Pohl, 2021;
Roberts, 2014; Roberts and Dewsbury, 2021: Saldanha, 2020; Shaw and
Meehan, 2013), they nevertheless emerge, I show, less unproblematic in
the light of the negative condition of sphere-dwelling. To unpack this,
we need to go back to a difference between breathing and attunement.
While the latter refers to ways of becoming-attuned to certain
atmospheric configurations, breathing is importantly also about staying
alive in certain gaseousness formations of material atmospheres. Albeit
both do help in acknowledging our bodily vulnerability to atmospheric,
it is the latter that brings to the fore the irresolvable limit present
in all corporeality: [[the impossibility of]{.mark} a [living]{.mark}
body [to not breathe]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Luce Irigaray (1999: 8)
asks[, 'is not air the whole of our habitation as mortals? Can we live
elsewhere than in air?' Indeed, body dwells in spheres by breathing.
While [inhaling and exhaling]{.mark} are something that [take place in
**gaseous proximities**]{.mark}]{.underline} and in relation to various
(at times toxic and weaponised) compositions of air, the necessity to
breathe is in itself something the body remains dependent on, and, as a
result, fundamentally limited by. Breathing is something that demands to
be constantly addressed, thus constituting, as Joronen and Rose (2021:
1410) recently wrote, a vulnerability to 'which our bodies are wholly
and unremittingly beholden'. Corporeal vulnerability to breathing, in
other words, signifies a condition that a living body cannot resolve,
escape, or overcome. [[Breathing]{.mark} in this regard constitutes a
negative condition that [constantly makes bodies **dependent** on air,
and]{.mark} so [exposed to]{.mark} the **[aerial proximities]{.mark}**
they inhabit.]{.underline} Importantly, it is this unresolvable
vulnerability to air that, I argue, reveals the intrinsic negativity of
sphere-dwelling. Such dependence between the body and the air is not
something that could be framed merely as a relational assemblage,
ultimately constituted out of the relational field of (always) capable
constellations of affective forces. Sphere-dwelling rather denotes a
sphereological vulnerability that is fundamentally limited by the bodily
inability to overcome its own vulnerability to breathing. While ways of
weaponising breathing do certainly contain differences that go back to
various (power) relations (as exemplified in previous sections) that
also constitute breathing bodies in relation to entities other than
human -- [gases, molecules, sound waves, **[weapon
technologies]{.mark}**, **climatic alterations** and so on -- there is
no **relational configuration** of 'sphere-dwelling' that could somehow
[set aside the **corporeal** necessity to
**breathe**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Paul Harrison (2007: 591)
writes, with a nod to Heidegger (2001), inasmuch as 'the hollow \[or
should we say the air?\] gives the essence of a jug, the nonrelational
relates the relational' \[my addition\]. [All relational assemblings and
**weaponisations** of **sphere-dwelling** are, in other words, carried
by the **nonrelational** facticity that in order to be alive, the body
needs air to breathe.]{.underline} It is here that we arrive to what
remains a key for understanding how atmospheric negations work as
embodied proximities of sphere-dwelling. [Atmospheric **negations**
orchestrated with tear gas, skunk water, and **poison clouds,** or
through **hostile attunements**, are ways of [**weaponising
bodies**]{.mark} through their vulnerability to spheric]{.underline}.
Importantly, this comes back to the very possibility of bodies to
orientate towards the world, as atmospheric weaponisations, instead of
successfully directing bodies towards the spaces they dwell in,
constitute [[spheres]{.underline} [that **disrupt**, **contaminate**,
**incapacitate**, **wear out**, and **cut off** bodies from
their]{.underline}]{.mark} [(mundane)
**[orientations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Hannah, 2019). Here the focus
turns from what bodies are capable of to what they are incapable of,
which further problematises the inherent vitalism and ontologisation of
capacity that characterises much of the existing discussion on affect
and materiality (e.g. Anderson, 2014; Bridge, 2020; Gallagher, 2016;
Roberts, 2014; Roberts and Dewsbury, 2021). Atmospheric weaponisations
create what Sara Ahmed (2006) aptly calls the 'spaces of I cannot' --
spheres where bodies remain first disoriented, disrupted, prevented,
incapacitated, violently negated, or even completely amputated from
their ability to orientate towards the world. In as much as bodies hence
remain incapacitated by atmospheric negations, it is also the case that
the spheric too remains vulnerable to bodily functions, enactments, and
sensibilities. [[Bodies can learn to]{.mark} 'breath back' and
'[cultivate breath']{.mark} with rhythms [different from]{.mark} those
of **[violent atmospheres]{.mark}**, in as much as they can find ways of
**attunement different** to those dictated by **atmospheres** of
**aggression**.]{.underline} Importantly, the affective politics of such
bodily irreducibility cannot be reduced to a mere valuation of joyful
and hopeful affectual registers over the negative and paranoic ones
(Sedqwick, 2003; cf. Hitchen, 2021; Ruez and Cockyane, 2021).
Sphere-dwelling rather consists of irreducible embodiments, where bodies
might remain exposed to certain atmospheric attunements, but where they
simply learn not to affirm. [Atmospheric weaponisations, especially when
potentially lethal or otherwise posing a **serious threat to life** and
health, thus [bring forth the **political importance of not
affirming**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As shown above, such politics is also
connected to breathing -- to a cultivation of breath with different
rhythms; [to a protection of breathing]{.underline}; even to a moment of
'taking a breath' when the disruptive sonic aggressions fill the ether.
Here bodies are not simply negating the atmospheric negations in
symmetric fashion, but instead cultivate their irreducibility to spheric
violence by breathing beyond (and against) the prevalent atmospheric
weaponisations. Bodily irreducibility to atmospheric hence works, not in
a dialectical way (see Mann, 2008; Sheppard, 2008), but by mobilising
the irreducibility of the body to what the body inhabits. It is this
irreducible sphereological reciprocity that resituates 'sphere-dwelling'
from the ontological orderings of affirmative vitalism to what I call
the negativity of the ontological. Sphere-dwelling shows how atmospheric
negations are constituted through a sphereological vulnerability that
further marks the incapacity of the spheric and the irreducible
vulnerability of the body. Importantly, such acknowledgment offers a
reading of negativity as a sphereological vulnerability that does not
define, order, or ground ontological configurations of atmospheric but
merely pushes a negative limit-figure at their centre. Instead of
'double yes' of affirmative thinking, where according to Paul Harrison
(2015) the 'first yes' recognises the ontological primacy of productive
becoming of life, the 'second yes' presenting a priori ethical judgement
that prioritises the 'affirmation of affirmation' as the good, and
indeed, the only preferable ethical choice for politics, such
limit-figure allows various constellations of sphere-dwelling to come to
being as compositions incapable of draining empty their own negativity
-- their own vulnerability. Here the 'first yes' to ontological
liveliness and productivity becomes problematic through the prevalence
of negative condition of 'sphere-dwelling', which constantly keeps
breathing bodies exposed to spheric, and the spheric unable to maintain
its atmospheric configurations. [The '**second yes'**, the **preferred**
ethical judgement, in turn is left open to **various cultivations** of
[irreducible bodies]{.mark} that, often in order to merely stay alive,
[need to]{.mark} undo, [**escape**, and even **end**]{.mark} (Dekeyser,
2023), [rather than **affirm**, atmospheric
weaponisations]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is regarding the first yes (to
ontology) that I suggest the recognition of breathing as a
pneumatological vulnerability can help in turning the focus from the
ground-offering onto-theologies and ontologisations of positive
metaphysics towards thinking sphere-dwelling through its dependence on
what Luce Irigaray (1999: 5) calls the 'groundlessness' of air. By
following Irigaray's insight, instead of simply serving a ground for
living, air can be seen to point out the impossibility of final
ontology; namely, its negativity. It does so, not necessarily through
the jug-defining 'hollow' of Heidegger (2001: 167) that ultimately
signifies, as Harrison (2007) suggested above, the 'emptiness' and
'void' as part of the ontology (see also Kingsbury and Secor, 2021), but
by dissolving the ontological. [Air, in other words, is not a thing but
a **vulnerable** happening that constantly allows **fluctuating**,
**radiating**, **hovering** and **vibrating** materialities to emerge
and dissolve through its groundless openness. Indeed, as Ingold (2005)
reminds, [we need air not **only to breathe**]{.mark} and do things,
[but]{.mark} also [to]{.mark} **[perceive]{.mark}**: air transmits
fields of [**radiant energy** and **vibrations** that allow us to see
and hear]{.mark}; it carries (mal)odorous [molecules]{.mark} [that
bodies]{.mark} (with olfactory receptors) [can smell]{.mark}; and it
holds separations and [proximities that allow us to]{.mark} touch and
**[relate things]{.mark}.** In other words, the **groundless openness**
of air signifies air's ability to **enable** (and disable) seeing in
light and dark, hearing in **silence** and **noise**, and breathing in
gaseous **compositions** that air brings **proximate**.]{.underline}
What remains proximate in inhabitation of air is thus not something
solid with a ground, but the groundless no-thingness of air, always
ruining meta-physical endeavours in their search for foundations,
ground, and abiding ontological axioms for existing (by literally making
them to vanish into a thin air). And yet such air, though constituted
through the impossibility to fix the ontological with positive
denominators, is also breathable air. As a lack of ground, it opens up
air-spheres of proximity for bodies to dwell, breathe and live in. With
every breath, such pneumatological proximity of air and its material
compositions is being build and undone, this being the case also when
such proximity is turned [unbreathable with toxic, polluted, and
weaponized air-spheres. On the one hand, bodily **vulnerability** to air
can hence be **weaponized** to transmit **formations** of
**atmospheric** negations; on the other hand, these
**[weaponisations]{.mark}** [of air are]{.mark} fragile, [constantly at
the **verge of losing**]{.mark} their
**[compositions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Tear gases disperse and vanish
in the air, skunk smell wears off and eventually faints its odor, sounds
echo and vibrate for their own time in their limited proximities -- even
long-term affections to violence become replaced with other atmospheric
attunements. Air, in other words, can transmit but not ground; it is
neither empty (void) nor a thing, but open for the fluctuating,
vibrating, radiating, and lingering proximities to happen for bodies to
sense, breathe and dwell in. Importantly, it is such proximate
climatization process that speaks further to recent works on 'negative
geographies' (see Bissell et al., 2021; Dekeyser et al., 2022;
Landau-Donnelly and Pohl, 2023), in particular by considering
negativity, less as an alternative ontology (i.e. as a negative
ontology), and more as an alternative to ontology (i.e. as a negativity
of ontology). [[This is not mere **semantics**]{.mark}, but a question
of approach: transmitted [proximities of air]{.mark} do [contain
**world-forming compositions**]{.mark} constituted through their
**prevalent** ways of coming to being]{.underline}, but they do so out
their proximate happening,2 not through the axioms set to define their
existence. Groundless air thus does not replace one set of ontological
orderings with another, presumable less obsolete one -- it does not
ground a new 'political ontology' (Landau-Donnelly and Pohl, 2023) [of
air with yet another metaphysical '**path-dependencies'**]{.underline}
(Joronen and Häkli, 2017) at worst [promoting **Western**, **masculine**
and/or **race-blind** sensibilities]{.underline} (see Ruez and Cockayne,
2021; Sundberg, 2014; Tolia-Kelly, 2006) -- but rather allows spheric
proximities to emerge, happen and melt into thin air. Indeed, such
groundless negativity is precisely what keeps the air open to various
atmospheric climatization and weaponisations, while also carrying them
in their vanishing ontological compositions and dissolving proximities.
Negativity, as an impossibility to disclose sphere-dwelling in
ontological terms, signifies what remains transmitted to the proximity
of breathing bodies: namely, the groundless air, the compositions of
which (lingering and dissolving) the body inhabits, depends on, and
remains irreducibly exposed to.

In July 1947---­ after five years of trials and errors---­ Stephen J.
Eszenyi became convinced that the most powerful military on the planet
could not overcome the Arctic. As the officer in charge of the US Naval
Arctic Test Station at Point Barrow, Alaska, Eszenyi had witnessed
firsthand how the tundra thwarted the production of oil, the lifeblood
of modern warfare. Bulldozers, tractors, and Weasels a tank-like vehicle
built during World War II for use in snow­ could muster a top speed of
only 5 miles an hour. Compensating for the rough terrain meant driving
in second gear, which burned out transmissions. The actual drilling
presented a whole other set of issues. At each location, engineers had
to thaw the frozen surface before driving supporting piles, requiring
expensive and heavy steam jet heaters. Once the soil warmed enough to
allow excavation, the biting cold emerged from below, encasing the pile
in rock-strewn ice. Exasperated, Eszenyi boiled down the situation for
his navy superiors: "Pileloading in the Arctic is not the same problem
as it is in the States."1 Failure was not an option. [[Alaska]{.mark}'s
north slope was a critical source of fuel for military operations in a
**[northern theater of conflict]{.mark}**, first during World War II and
then in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. To ensure continental
security, Eszenyi, along with the support of the US and Canadian
governments, [embarked on a radical course of
action]{.mark}.]{.underline} He recommended that military forces ditch
customary engineering principles and revamp their entire approach to
defense. Rather than "combat nature and her forces by strengthening
material," they should "cooperate with nature." Eszenyi proposed an
extensive research program that investigated permafrost, the term coined
for the foreboding subsurface conditions he found on the Arctic slope.
He called for scientific investigations to determine methods for
constructing drainage and sewage systems, roads, airfields, buildings
and insulation, fuel storage pits, feed storage lockers, and, finally,
piles. He was confident that results from such research would "make it
possible for future economical planning."2 Eszenyi's proposal came to
fruition. In 1947, the year he sent his memo, the Office of Naval
Research created the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory, the United
States' first laboratory in the Arctic. There, physical scientists from
universities, governmental agencies, and armed forces in the United
States and Canada worked side by side to figure out the dynamics of
permafrost and how to work around them. In 1952, Canada's Division of
Building Research and National Research Council opened a similar
laboratory in the northern Northwest Territories. Like the US lab, the
Northern Research Station at Norman Wells sat beside an oil production
facility, this one operated by Imperial Oil, a subsidiary of Standard
Oil. [The more [research]{.mark}ers and officials learned about the
frozen soil, the more they [saw knowledge]{.mark} about it [as
foundational to]{.mark} both the [Arctic's defense]{.mark} and its long-­
term development.]{.underline} In addtion to its immediate military
applications, permafrost science promised to unlock Arctic oil and
natural gas deposits. Boosters hoped these northern re- sources could
meet skyrocketing consumer demand for petroleum products in metropolitan
North America. As territorial officials in Alaska curried favor with
private investors, the government of Canada sought a suitable site for
an administrative hub for a future Arctic oil economy. In 1959, the same
year Alaska earned statehood, Canada completed Inuvik in the heart of
the Mackenzie Delta. Both the US and Canadian governments seized this
moment, and the fund of scientific knowledge about what lay beneath the
tundra, to lease millions of acres of the western Arctic to oil
companies. [Between 1944 and 1959, [scientific]{.mark}
[understanding]{.mark} of permafrost [catalyzed]{.mark} another round of
**[transformations]{.mark}** in the far north.]{.underline} That
scientific representations of a strategic Arctic might inspire such
interventions was nothing new to the region by midcentury. [But this
chapter of [colonialism]{.mark}'s northern history does stand apart from
its predecessors for two significant reasons.]{.underline} First, the
wartime context and innovations in transportation technology made it
possible for governments to stage operations in the Arctic that were far
more complex and widespread than in previous years. [Meanwhile, as
scientists, militaries, and oil companies [moved north, Inuit had fewer
opportunities for mobility and adaptation. The means of]{.mark}
production developed by [outsiders]{.mark}­ whether of science or oil­
[excluded Native northerners like never before.]{.mark} Field-­ workers
and engineers flew in by airplane to towns and laboratories they built
to extract resources that Inuit did not ordinarily use. Yet even if
[Inuit]{.mark} did not imagine themselves within the world being created
by southerners, they [could hardly avoid participating in it]{.mark}.
[While the United States and Canada established]{.mark} an Arctic oil
economy, [the world Inuit had built deteriorated.]{.mark}]{.underline}
In the 1950s, fur-­ bearing creatures became harder to find, markets for
fur evaporated, and the Hud- son's Bay Company converted its Arctic fur
posts from fur trade centers to retail outlets. [For both outsiders and
Inuit, the 1950s were a turning point, when the machines and methods of
[colonialism became the vehicles of cultural
survival.]{.mark}]{.underline}

colonialist forces]{.mark} as their 19th-century forebears.]{.underline}
America today still constitutes what he describes as a "pointillist
empire": a globe-spanning hegemon enabled by the tiny specks of land it
controls across the globe. The idea that America is an empire, of
course, is not a new one. It has a long pedigree among authors,
intellectuals, and left-leaning critics of American foreign policy. At
least historically, whether it was westward expansion or the annexation
of the Philippines, [[U.S]{.mark}. leaders repeatedly [expanded
America's territorial footprint and global reach while simultaneously
denying or concealing that they were doing]{.mark} so.]{.underline} But
while Immerwahr's book draws a straight line between America's history
and its present, reality is fuzzier. Was America an empire? Undoubtedly.
Is America today still an empire? It's much harder to say, particularly
because the author steers clear of the political science debates about
hierarchy, imperial systems, and global governance. The concept of
"empire" is fundamentally about political control. But Immerwahr instead
focuses on the physical aspect of empire: on territory and,
specifically, on America's 800-some bases around the world. His book
thus hews to a more traditional understanding of empire as territorial
control, rather than to modern conceptions of empire as informal
control, "soft hegemony," or political and economic influence.
Immerwahr's territorial focus is a compelling frame for understanding
the injustices of America's colonial past --- and the fact that the
American public has yet to come to terms with it. But today, if the
United States has an empire, it is not territorial. It is a far subtler
network of informal control that sustains and prolongs America's
privileged political and economic position in the international system.
So while there are many good strategic, economic, and even moral reasons
to downsize America's global military footprint, focusing on territory
is misplaced. The real question is whether the United States should be
seeking or maintaining global political dominance. Primacists --- at
least tacitly --- often agree it should; realists argue that it's simply
not necessary to do so. To make the case for America's modern-day
"pointillist empire," Immerwahr's book inverts a commonly heard
argument. As pundits like Thomas Friedman are wont to opine, new
technologies shrink the world. That feeling of a smaller, more connected
world understandably --- though often wrongly --- raises fears that
American security is imperiled by faraway events. The result, as Patrick
Porter describes, is that "fear is never far away from the rhetoric of
globalism, about new vulnerabilities and the ease with which aggressors
can apply violence over large spaces." For Immerwahr, however, it's not
about security. Instead, technology is the great enabler of American
empire. Technological innovation --- from airplanes to malaria pills ---
has allowed postwar America to project power without the need for
occupation and direct military control of more than a few strategically
located specks of land. Aircraft carriers obviate the need for permanent
air bases. Radio and satellites enable long-distance communication
without control of the territory in between. It's an intriguing and
intuitively appealing argument in an era of American military primacy.
The "pointillist empire" that Immerwahr describes can be visualized as
the small pinpricks of land necessary to make the whole system work.
America's base network includes airstrips on remote islands (Ascension
or Diego Garcia), forward bases (Ramstein in Germany or Al Udeid in
Qatar), and smaller cooperative security locations (various
counter-terrorism bases in Africa, for example). Some of these host
missiles or drones, others communications technology, and still others
just soldiers and sailors. Yet while the book effectively makes the case
that technology enables America's global military presence, the thornier
question is whether that setup truly constitutes an empire. For
political scientists, territory isn't the measure of empire; political
control of peripheral areas outside the metropole is. Colonialism is one
model of empire, but not the only one. Today's base network undoubtedly
raises some of the same moral issues as colonialism does: There are
sovereignty concerns in places like Okinawa. There are human rights
considerations, whether it's human trafficking near military bases or
the continued exclusion of locals from ancestral lands in the Chagos
Islands. But modern-day America's territorial holdings --- its military
bases --- simply don't rise to that level of political control. This is
why most political scientists who study the question of empire in
American foreign policy today don't focus on territory. Instead, they
frame it in terms of political influence or hierarchy. Of course, even
if America does retain some sort of empire, the book --- perhaps
unintentionally --- makes the case that it is substantially more benign
than most historical empires. To be frank, the modern iniquities of the
"pointillist empire" presented in the book's latter half are minor when
compared to the gut-wrenching overview of American conquest and
colonialism that makes up the first half of the book. The book is
unflinching in its refusal to shrink from the darkest corners of
American imperial history. It explores America's conquered territories
--- places like Guam, Saipan, the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico ---
and the choice of American policymakers in the 19th and 20th centuries
to largely hide this unofficial empire from public scrutiny. In
retrospect, the reasons are obvious. America has long viewed itself as a
republic, not an empire. Imperial possessions undermined that cherished
myth. The situation was also complicated by the racist attitudes of the
era. Unlike many other empires, the United States offered a path for
territories to eventually join the union as full partners. But
territories like Puerto Rico or the Philippines could not easily follow
that well-worn path to statehood without forcing America's political
class to reckon with the fraught question of citizenship and political
rights for non-white residents. Better, leaders decided, to ignore the
issue and hide it from public view. Unfortunately, the results were
often devastating for the natives of these territories. The American
territories were (and are) a legal no-man's land: full of U.S. nationals
rather than U.S. citizens, bound by only some of the country's legal and
constitutional framework. Some of the consequences were horrifying, from
torture at Guantanamo Bay to the use of Puerto Rico as a testing ground
for drugs deemed too risky or difficult to test on the mainland.
Immerwahr's book is thus a call for Americans to acknowledge their own
past. Implicit in the text is a variety of challenging moral questions
that Americans rarely have to confront: the horrors of colonialism and
the culpability and guilt that subsequent generations should bear for
the sins of their fathers. As a British citizen, I and most of my peers
are familiar with these questions, if only thanks to family history. My
great-grandfather died in World War I defending the Palestinian
territories. My great-great-great uncle was David Livingstone. Yes, that
Dr. Livingstone. So trust me when I say that I have seriously thought
about the legacies of colonialism. It's deeply uncomfortable to know
that your ancestors helped to build an empire, subjugated less advanced
countries, and attempted to "civilize" them. It's even more
uncomfortable to know that many still believe empire to have been an
unabashed good; as Boris Johnson once memorably described Africa, "The
problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are not in
charge anymore." The controversy resonates strongly in Britain's
political culture today and shapes its global interactions. Is the same
true for the United States? Americans, of course, have similarly
meditated on their culpability for slavery and segregation. In the 2020
presidential campaign, reparations have become a mainstream topic of
discussion. But as How to Hide an Empire highlights, [**Americans don't
have a similar frame for their imperial past: It has been effectively
hidden from them. Generations of American [politicians]{.mark}
endeavored to [convince mainland populations that territories]{.mark}
like Puerto Rico [were not truly "America,"]{.mark} with the disturbing
result that, even today, 46 percent of Americans don't know Puerto
Ricans are citizens**.]{.underline} The secrecy continues to this day:
[It often takes security breaches and intrepid journalism for the
locations of America's overseas bases to even become
public.]{.underline} As a result, Immerwahr's book is a riveting read
whose policy implications --- despite the somewhat misguided focus on
America's base network --- are as much about facing the past as
suggesting a path for the future. [America's status as an empire today
may be debatable, but [its colonial legacy is laid out clearly and
completely in a story that's hard to put down]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[That legacy of ambivalence about empire is relevant for today's foreign
policy debates, and it is clearly still shaping life in the
semi-American territories today.]{.underline} At a time when President
Donald Trump rails on Twitter about ungrateful and lazy Puerto Ricans
and his administration tries to portray that territory as a foreign
country and denies it the disaster aid granted to predominantly white
states, Immerwahr's argument is deeply relevant. [To right the
injustices he spotlights, [America]{.mark}ns would [need to]{.mark}
start a serious debate about Puerto Rican statehood.]{.underline}
[They'd need to [end]{.mark} unjust and unequal laws like the Jones Act,
which imposes [harsh penalties on businesses and citizens in Hawaii,
Alaska, and elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} They'd have to give
residents of territories like Guam much more choice about whether they
choose to host U.S. bases and missiles. And to address the more
difficult question of modern American empire, they'd need to grapple
with whether today's foreign policy is truly a benign global system of
liberal order or simply a more subtle and insidious form of empire. It
would be an extremely difficult conversation. After all, as How to Hide
an Empire makes clear, how can Americans contend with the legacies of
colonialism --- let alone consider the tricky question of whether
America today has or should have an empire --- if its imperial past is
hidden from them?

[[According to poststructuralist IR theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
offers an alternative to mainstream positivist theories of international
politics, "every discussion and [[everyday understanding of
international politics depends upon abstraction, representation and
interpretation]{.underline}."]{.mark} 16 This assertion challenges the
ontological foundations of positivism on the grounds that "the world"
(in Foucault's sense of the word) does not present itself to us in the
form of ready-made categories, theories, or statements.17 Arguably,
therefore, identity itself is problematized by its systematic
dissociation at the ontological level. Following this reasoning,
poststructuralists warn that people should "avoid substituting causes
for effects."18 In other words, poststructuralism does not treat
identity or agency as given, but seeks to account for the forces that
underwrite apparent sources of identity or agency. In a nutshell,
identity is an effect to be interpreted, not assumed. In epistemological
terms, accordingly, the [[poststructuralist IR approach challenges the
conventional understanding of international issues by problematizing the
given objects such as meaning, identity, and
reality.]{.underline}]{.mark} Foucault makes it clear that
poststructuralism has "an ethicopolitical purpose in problematising
prevailing identity formations which appear normal or natural."19
Poststructuralism rejects the very dichotomy of reality and narrative.
Rather than a simple representation of some previous event, narrative is
the means by which the status of reality is conferred on events. In a
sense, the subject and the object are mutually constitutive. In this
process, the knowledge and power nexus is crucial, as the power of
particular discourses/knowledge materializes elements into
comprehensible forms with political effects.20 [[Consequently, in
adopting a poststructuralist approach, the present research]{.mark} does
not join the debate on whether China poses a real threat, or the nature
of that threat, but [focuses on how the China threat has been
discursively constructed and performed in the West.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This article identifies the three modes of securitization activity. In
all of these modes, [[securitizing agents communicate the China
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} Securitization of the "China Threat"
Discourse: A Poststructuralist Account 165 issue referentially (that is,
using the linguistic act of identifying something) to their
audiences/subjects in the context of shared knowledge in a particular
domain. [[It can be]{.underline}]{.mark} structurally [[incorporated
into the]{.mark} [field of theoretical research,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[addressed to elites and focused on the security and strategic
sectors.]{.underline} It can also be structurally incorporated into
[[ideological debates and conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}, addressed [[to
an attentive or well-informed public and focused on the political
sector]{.underline}]{.mark}. Alternatively, it can be assigned to a
broad context of culture and civilization, addressed to the general
public and encompassing a comprehensive range of sectors. In these
processes, the actors are performing acts with communicative force.
Although the intended meanings are not directly signaled, they can be
inferred from the contexts of the different modes. The so-called China
threat can be predicted as inevitable, based on deductive reasoning from
scientific theory. Rhetorical power comes from a specialized domain of
scholarly expertise. Following an inductive logic, the same conclusion
can be drawn from past experiences and current observations. It can also
be inferred from psychological traits and prejudices. In the latter
case, the issue of [[the China threat is securitized by eliciting an
intuitive emotional response from the audience that bypasses ordinary
justification]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, the subject's
perception of the China threat results from immediate a priori knowledge
or experiential belief. The agents thereby heighten their audiences'
sense of the seriousness and urgency of the issue. A securitization act
succeeds only when it achieves the intended effect. [[A
poststructuralist securitization analysis of the China
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} issue in this article
[[reveal]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[the specific ways in which power and
knowledge constitute each other through different
modes.]{.underline}]{.mark} All types of performative communication,
regardless of their domains, attempt to build identities--- in this
case, that of a "threatening" China---through means such as linking and
differentiating. The real aim of this process of securitization is not
to identify the cause of the "China threat," but rather to elicit a
reaction from an audience. [[The China threat]{.underline}]{.mark}
thesis [[may become a selffulfilling prophecy]{.underline}]{.mark}. If
so, this may have very real policy implications and political
consequences

As a political myth, [[the securitization of the China threat operates
within a]{.mark} corresponding [epistemic terrain. It targets]{.mark}
the general public, [an audience as]{.mark} wide and as [large as
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline} Again, [[effective securitization relies
on the use of language appropriate to context and audience.]{.underline}
[Securitization discourses]{.underline}]{.mark} in this mode [[are not
confined]{.mark}]{.underline} to the linguistic sphere;75 they may
include, for example, signs, images, and rituals. The BBC documentary is
typical in its deployment of a wide variety of discourses, such as
interviews, nonverbal communication, written text, and signs. The
documentary provides a clear visual illustration of the allegation that
a growing China is encroaching on the globe. In attempting to arouse an
emotional response from the general public, the documentary includes
stories told by ordinary people, accompanied by vivid pictures and
signs. [[The securitizers hope that raising consciousness of and
inspiring an emotional response to the so-called China threat will
elicit action to prevent it.]{.underline}]{.mark} The [[success of a
political myth lies not only in its production,
"but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather, and foremost, [[\[in\] its
reception.]{.underline}]{.mark}"76 Indeed, the "work" of myth can be
characterized as a system of "production---reception---reproduction."77
In other words, [[this process of securitization "coagulates and
reproduces significance"]{.mark}; 78 it should then be able [to address
"the specifically political conditions"79 in which the]{.mark} intended
[subjects live,]{.mark} and the meanings they share as a
community.]{.underline} This process is fully implemented in The Chinese
Are Coming. In terms of substantial modality, agents working in the
political myth mode aim to securitize the sheer comprehensiveness of the
threat posed by China, which is represented as covering a wide range of
social spheres. In addition to its military, strategic, and political
threats, China is imagined to endanger economic, environmental, social,
and cultural development worldwide. Rowlatt concludes at the end of the
BBC documentary that "China's expansion into the world is transforming
not just the global economy but also the balance of world power." The
"price that is being paid" is made clear, including "the environmental
damage this rush for resources is wreaking" and the undermining of
"local businesses almost everywhere." He concludes that the 21st century
will certainly be China's century, and that the rise of China will
profoundly affect people all over the world.

#### The implementation of China as a threat by securitizers goes down to the very basic discourses we have, to sperate that we think as unknown to a now threatening other.

In the mode of political myth, [[the China threat]{.mark} issue
[is]{.mark} structurally [incorporated by]{.mark} a group of
[securitizers into the "basic discourses" of culture and
civilization.]{.mark}]{.underline} The issue does not appear to be a
question of security because it is assigned to a broader context wherein
a country as different as China is expanding its reach throughout the
world. [However, [the]{.mark} real [purpose of]{.mark} the mythical mode
of [securitization is]{.mark} again [to construct the China threat as
such, and]{.mark} ultimately [to call for action against it]{.mark}.
[Securitizers]{.mark} working [in this mode thus promulgate political
myths about the ]{.mark}]{.underline}issue. A [[myth is]{.mark} rendered
[specifically "political"]{.mark} not by its content but [by the
relationship between a given narrative and the political conditions of a
given group]{.mark}]{.underline}.70 [In the documentary titled The
Chinese Are Coming, the [securitizers use a differentiating logic to
construct China as a]{.mark} country, nation, and culture/civilization
that is quite [alien to the West]{.mark}.]{.underline} When Chinese
sailors in the harbor of Luanda offer to share their lunch with the
narrator, for example, he merely observes that their style of cooking is
unfamiliar. A more dramatic scene occurs at Kafue, a large wildlife
national park in Zambia. Some chopsticks and a hanko ("seal" in
Japanese), both made of ivory, are presented to the audience[. Although
there is no evidence of the market(s) to which these items are exported,
the blame for the killing of elephants in Africa is attributed to China.
[The conclusion is then drawn that "there are aspects of Chinese culture
that represent a threat ]{.mark}]{.underline}to the very wildlife the
tourists come to see." Similarly, another study provides evidence that
most [Western attempts to portray Chinese firms as cruel, unconcerned
with human rights, and the "worst employers" in Africa are highly
inaccurate, with methodological mistakes and elementary empirical
errors.71 [It is clear that the essence of a political myth does not lie
in its truthfulness, but rather in how it is articulated to compel
attention and action.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [above are]{.underline}
only a few [examples of a series of acts of exclusion and
marginalization perpetrated by Western agents seeking to construct China
as culturally alien.]{.underline}72 The linking method is also used in
this process. For example, in an act of narrativized "reality" wherein
Rowlatt takes the same railway route as British colonizers from Angola
into the heartland of Africa to tell the story of the Chinese in Africa
today, China is alleged to be following Britain's footsteps in
colonizing the African continent. The reality of Chinese neocolonization
is narrated as "real"; 73 narrative serves more as the means by which
the status of reality is conferred on an event. Through similar
narrative activities, [[securitizers try to construct "a figured
world,]{.mark}"74 or a story of a simplified world that equates
typicality with veracity]{.underline}. In this figured world, the
[[Chinese identity is differentiated from the Western]{.mark} model of
the ["normal" and linked with a threatening
"other.]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} It is conceived as an expanding
power, growing at a phenomenal speed and posing many challenges to the
world.

Contrary to these assessments, Chan and Overholt in particular agree, in
part on shared grounds, that [China does not constitute an immediate
threat to international peace and security or, more
specifically,]{.underline} the United States. [Perceptions of
the]{.underline} [supposed threat it poses are derived from **'obsolete
and inaccurate caricatures'** of Chinese intentions and character that
have come to influence the formulation of foreign policy, in particular
that of the United States]{.underline} (Overholt 2008: 7). Thus, neither
power transition theory nor the successor-state image provides an
accurate assessment of the China threat for Chan or Overholt. China does
not, according to either author, pose a direct threat either to the
United States in particular or the international community in general.
In particular[, [the historical analyses on which claims of the threat
posed by a rising China are based]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and their
subsequent pairings as historical analogies with contemporary China,
[are **fundamentally flawed**]{.mark}. Not only does [post

In China, IR [[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} were also quick to [[link
the China-Threat discourse to]{.underline}]{.mark} the yellow peril fear
and the genealogy of **[[racist western doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark}**
pertaining to China (Shi, 1997; Luo, 1997; Li, 1999; Shi, 2004; Chen,
2005). My analytical focus here is not on revealing whether the U.S.
mediatic portrayal of Lee borrowed from yellow peril imageries in its
construction of China as a security threat---although Hanser (2013)
found racist footprints in major U.S. print-media coverage of scandals
involving defective/contaminated products manufactured in China.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, what I am concerned with is how
[**[racial profiling]{.mark}**]{.underline} appears to have [[played a
role in]{.underline}]{.mark} Dr. Lee's case. Racist or not as a
discourse, [[the China-Threat]{.underline}]{.mark} is racist in its
consequence. For instance, in 1997 when the CIA and other
security-related agencies took stock of China's sudden advance in
nuclear design, some voices of reason noted that more than a few
thousand scientists and federal workers had had access to the W-88
warhead blueprint design, so it was premature to think the alleged theft
had occurred at Los Alamos. But, once Los Alamos was nevertheless
"established" as the institutional source of the said leak, mostly
because the W-88 was originally designed there, the suspicion quickly
fell on Dr. Lee, one of the few scientists with Chinese heritage who had
contacts with Mainland Chinese colleagues in the 1980s.

#### Instead of fixing issues securitization only increases racial profiling of minorities in high-ranking positions.

China is certainty a security threat to U.S. national interests. But the
assessment of threats or security issues is a question of degree, and as
Dr. Lee's case reveals[, China-Threat episodes seem to have
over-securitized Americans of Chinese heritage.]{.underline} During
their peak phases, [[one consequence of these episodes appears to **be
racial profiling in key political and social
fields**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Directly addressing the question of
institutional racism in its article on the Dongfan Chung case, however,
The New York Times clearly dissociated itself from securitizing forces.
The journalist indicates that court documents suggested that "Mr. Chung
decided to spy for China partly out of patriotic sentiment."68 The
reporter continues, "\[t\]he appeal to ethnic loyalty raises the
sensitive issue of whether the authorities have reason to be more
suspicious of Chinese researchers and students."69 Paradoxically---or
perhaps with the intention of showcasing how The Times had learned its
lesson two decades ago, the news story mentions Dr. Wen Ho [[Lee's
case]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[a clear example **where racial profiling
played a role**]{.underline}]{.mark} in singling out a scientist with
Chinese heritage as a traitor. Was it also the case for the 2010-2016
period in a context of tense Sino-American relations? And if so, who was
targeting Sino-American or Chinese-born scientists on U.S. soil?
According to Steve W. Pelak, the export enforcement coordinator in the
counterespionage section of the Justice Department, the answer is U.S.
companies themselves. He explains "'\[a\]lmost [[all of
the]{.mark}]{.underline} department\'s [[cases involving suspected
Chinese espionage]{.underline}]{.mark} \[...\] [[come from companies
that report a]{.mark}]{.underline} commercial inquiry or [[request that
seems suspicious]{.mark}]{.underline} and not through surveillance
[[because someone has **Chinese heritage or
connections**]{.underline}.]{.mark}"70 The degree to which Pelak is
trying to deny racist practice is impossible to know. But data from Pew

"Lots of cars go over 60 miles per hour, but this is like ticketing just

Dr. Wen Ho Lee's family, said to a Times journalist outside the

little doubt [[Dr. Lee was a victim of racial profiling in a moment of

information shocks (Jones, 1994; Jones and Baumgartner, 2005) can propel
issues from obscurity to prominence, [I suggest instead that reflexive

Similarly, in cases of human-transmitted [[diseases]{.mark}, attempts to
contain reservoirs within particular regions [have involved racially and
xenophobically charged]{.mark} biosecurity
[measures]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the first two years of the
[[COVID]{.mark}-[19]{.mark}]{.underline} pandemic, wealthy countries
swiftly [[implemented]{.mark} [travel]{.mark} [restrictions]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} and from [regions]{.mark}]{.underline} in which new and
dangerous variants were identified for the first time while
simultaneously hoarding vaccines and critical therapeutics. The effect
was that countries [[such as South Africa, Brazil, India]{.mark}, and
many others [were stigmatized as reservoirs of dangerous
mutations]{.mark} of Covid-19, [blamed]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[perpetuating]{.mark} the [pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}, and isolated
rather than supported. An important counterpoint was the UK, the place
where the first variant of concern was identified, which led to
occasional bans of air travel to the country and disruption of
non-essential international travel. Nonetheless, travel bans and
restrictions imposed by other countries upon the UK were enforced for a
shorter time when compared with those applied to other places where
variants were originally identified. This suggests that geopolitical
affinities continue to overcome sanitary concerns in the contemporary
logic of early warning signals. Understanding how certain species and
[[populations shift from being conceived as reservoirs to being
conceived as targets]{.mark}]{.underline} is a powerful motivation for
inquiries on the management of emerging infectious diseases. Even if the
definition of disease reservoirs is inscribed in logics of blame and
politics of villainization, each with their own intricate histories, it
seems impossible to predict how the framing of a population or a species
as a disease reservoir will lead to a particular mode of intervention.
Shifting away from animals and toward the study and management of human
reservoirs in urban environments, Richard McKay's article closes the
special issue by examining the construction of the "male homosexual" as
a reservoir of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in North America.
Drawing upon metaphors and concepts derived from sanitary and tropical
medicine, as well as earlier fixations on female sex workers as STI
reservoirs, public health officials in the [[USA and Canada identified
male homosexuals]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a particular
[epidemiological]{.mark} [problem]{.mark}]{.underline} in the years
following WWII. Through a close examination of the multifarious
rhetorical, visual, and metaphorical meanings of the reservoir, McKay
shows how the concept itself [[enabled]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[justified]{.mark} the biopolitical [control]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
particular localities, groups of [marginalized
people]{.mark},]{.underline} and even changes to the built environment
of Vancouver. On the other hand, the fixation with "reservoirs of
infection" led to epidemiological oversights, in some cases facilitating
the further transmission of STIs. The idea of a reservoir of infection,
MacKay stresses, as a historically contingent cultural and medical
concept, with obscure and shifting boundaries, should be used with
caution

Science as a tool of empire [Many [scientific advancements were borne
out of colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in the field of
transportation, the development of steamboats came from the need to
navigate inland rivers in Africa, and early aircraft were used to
surveille and attack rebellions in some colonies, Roy (2014), and the
development of railways in the 19th century allowed faster inland travel
and created a closer link between the colonies and the Western powers,
Jedwab et al (2017). In communications, setting up telegraph lines was
vital to ensure messages could be sent over large distances and during
the Boer wars, the need for rapid communications that were hard to
intercept found its realisation in wireless radio, Roy (2014). In
medicine, the desire to reduce the spread and lethality of tropical
[[disease]{.underline}]{.mark}s encountered in the colonies meant that
many advancements were made in a short period of time Brown (2004). And
in engineering, the creation of newer, more lethal weapons was necessary
to allow more lands to be conquered and more people to be brought under
imperial rule, Bocetta (2017). However, it was not just that colonialism
benefited science. Although the domination of European powers opened up
new areas of research and provided insights into new fields of study,
the main driving force behind the science conducted in this era was the
fact [that [science]{.mark} could be [used to aid]{.mark} in this
[imperialist expansion]{.mark}. It [gave European]{.mark} nations an
[advantage over cultures]{.mark}]{.underline} which they were attempting
to bring under control, Adas (2016), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Arnold
(2006) referred to different fields of science as '[[tools of
empire']{.mark}.]{.underline} Research into cartography was motivated by
the need for an intimate knowledge of the local geography to
[[ensure]{.mark} that [imperial troops could push further
inland]{.mark}, and [advancement in the treatment of tropical diseases
was brought about not because of any goodwill towards the people under
colonial rule, but to protect the soldiers and agents of colonialism
from ill health]{.mark}]{.underline}, Roy (2014). In fact, the main
focus of [[science]{.mark} in the colonies [was]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
identify and extract natural resources to [further the imperialist
ideal]{.mark}]{.underline} In his book "Colonising the body" (1999),
Arnold also describes how the attempts to control outbreaks of
[[diseases]{.mark} like smallpox and cholera [led to the colonial
government implementing social controls]{.mark} on their subjects, by
[constricting]{.mark} their [movements]{.mark}]{.underline} and even
their diets. Adas (2016) talks about the use of science to influence non
colonised leaders. In places like China and Japan, even though there was
no imperial presence, the British empire still attempted to influence
local politics and affairs to suit itself. Science allowed colonial
powers to impress and gain access to leaders in Asia, and in this way,
these countries could be brought more under the control of the empire,
without being formally colonised. Ruane also describes the diagnosis of
a supposed illness, known as 'drapetomania', by the physician Samuel A.
Cartwright, which allegedly gave slaves the desire to run away, and was
attributed to their 'smaller brains and blood vessels'. [[To]{.mark}
[attribute]{.mark} the natural human instinct of [freedom]{.mark}

their [superiority over other races]{.mark}]{.underline} and that it was
seen as being only natural for African slaves to be in servitude.

#### Disease reps are colonial propaganda to hide the genocidal intent to Native Americans

For those who have been taught that [[Indigenous peoples were]{.mark}
virtually "[defenseless]{.mark}" [against European
diseases]{.mark},]{.underline} another underlying assumption is that
Indigenous communities either mounted no response to diseases or what
they did was counterproductive, and supposedly all of this directly
challenged their worldview and spiritual beliefs. [This [is]{.mark} also
[false]{.mark}.]{.underline} Prior to colonization, Indigenous
Americans---like all the world's peoples---had experience with treating
and understanding local disease and illness. Nations such as the
Cherokee, Creek (or Muskogee), Choctaw, and Chickasaw in response to the
Great Southeastern Smallpox Epidemic and outbreaks thereafter extended
their established views of disease to incorporate the new epidemics.
They relied on experienced healers, and their medical and spiritual
power, while observing ritualized quarantine and limiting contact with
colonial settlements. In more extreme circumstances of disease and
population loss, Indigenous nations, such as the Awahnichi (of Yosemite
Valley) acted as they had for millennia, moving and joining with others,
either temporarily or permanently. Focused on improving quality of life
and sustaining their nations into the future, these Indigenous
communities, did not abandon their identity, but they did---as they had
since long before colonization---adapt to new
circumstances.[\[11\]](https://www.oah.org/tah/rethinking-encounters/disruption-then-disease-contextualizing-colonization-and-disease-in-indigenous-north-america/#_edn11) Now
that scholars have established that the context of colonization is
critical to understanding Indigenous Americans' experience with
[[disease]{.mark}, some have started to investigate how this [connects
to genocide]{.mark}. Many rely on the [United Nation's definition where
genocide means "intent to destroy]{.mark}, in whole or in part, a
[national]{.mark}, [ethnical]{.mark}, racial or religious
[group]{.mark}]{.underline}, as such: a) killing members of the group;
b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
c) deliberately inflicting upon the group conditions of life calculated
to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; d) imposing
measures intended to prevent births within the group; e) forcibly
transferring children of the group to another group." But it's more than
that. For some, a focus on assumed accidental [[disease]{.mark} deaths
"[shifted blame off Europeans]{.mark}" [and onto blameless
germs]{.mark}.]{.underline}[\[17\]](https://www.oah.org/tah/rethinking-encounters/disruption-then-disease-contextualizing-colonization-and-disease-in-indigenous-north-america/#_edn17) In
many ways, this is comforting because "narratives of the inevitable
demise and vanishing of Native peoples fit seamlessly within our
national mythos of American expansion into an untamed and empty
wilderness."[\[18\]](https://www.oah.org/tah/rethinking-encounters/disruption-then-disease-contextualizing-colonization-and-disease-in-indigenous-north-america/#_edn18) By
obscuring how the actions of colonizers negatively impacted Indigenous
peoples' lives and health in the past, it is likewise easier to ignore
those same factors in the
present.[\[19\]](https://www.oah.org/tah/rethinking-encounters/disruption-then-disease-contextualizing-colonization-and-disease-in-indigenous-north-america/#_edn19)
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., for example, [[Native
Americans']{.mark} risk of [death]{.mark} was [2.1 times higher than
White Americans]{.mark}, attributed to severe health care inequities,
partially [tied]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a chronically [underfunded federal
Indian Health Service, along with other traumatic and racist colonial
legacies]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Native American people had the steepest
decline in life expectancy of any racial or ethnic group in the USA,
from age 71.8 years to 65.2 years, between 2019 and 2021; the life
expectancy gap between the US non-Hispanic White population and the
Native American population in 2021 was 11.2
years."[\[20\]](https://www.oah.org/tah/rethinking-encounters/disruption-then-disease-contextualizing-colonization-and-disease-in-indigenous-north-america/#_edn20) Significantly,
though, Indigenous researchers found that "from the beginning of the
Covid-19 vaccination campaign in the United States, the non-Hispanic
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population has continuously
had the highest first-dose and full vaccination rates of any racial or
ethnic group," which is vital to protecting Indigenous populations as
the world lives with COVID-19 into the future. Tribal governments and
Indigenous community-based organizations were central to vaccination
success, nimbly and innovatively promoting vaccination in culturally
appropriate ways. In other words, tribal sovereignty had a direct
positive impact on Indigenous health and surviving
disease.[\[21\]](https://www.oah.org/tah/rethinking-encounters/disruption-then-disease-contextualizing-colonization-and-disease-in-indigenous-north-america/#_edn21)
For at least the next generation, [[historians]{.mark} [must]{.mark}
emphatically and repeatedly [contextualize epidemics in Indigenous
communities to overcome]{.mark} the prevalence of the [inaccurate
"diseases spread like wildfire" among "defenseless Indians]{.mark}"
narrative. There is an abundance of nuanced research to rely on that
shows how [colonizers]{.mark} [disrupted]{.mark} Indigenous lives,
and [then diseases struck]{.mark}. We must also confront why we, along
with the public, have been so easily seduced by simplistic stories of
disease. [Inequities of wealth, health, and power today are the
descendants of past inequities]{.mark}. Do the stories we tell
[and]{.mark} the arguments we teach [reflect the power of colonial
hierarchies in our modern life]{.mark}]{.underline}

The paramount argument of [[the economic threat theory is that China's
economic strength will allow it to be increasingly assertive in the
region and in its interactions with the US]{.underline}.]{.mark} Denny
Roy writes that 'At its present rate of economic growth, China's
productive capabilities and total wealth will soon outstrip those of the
other Asia--Pacific powers, and increased relative capabilities make it
feasible for a rising great power to exert more control over its
surroundings. As a weaker power, China's dependence on the favor of it
neighbors has been comparatively high; as a great power, China will
behave boldly, more inclined to force its will upon others rather than
to consult with them'.35 Great powers have all historically used their
strength to promote their regional interests, and China's emergence as
an economic powerhouse alters the distribution of power in Asia.
Regarding China's use of its economic power to fund activities that
threaten US national security, Michael Waller of Insight Magazine
charges that 'Nuclear proliferators, terrorist states, foreign scam
operators and Third World mass murderers literally have been banking on
the failure of the United States to demand adequate transparency and
disclosure of the equities and bonds they introduce in U.S. capital
markets'.36 This allegation that China will use its increasing economic
strength against the US is flawed. In fact, [the very opposite may be
true: [China's growing economic]{.mark} interdependence with the markets
of the US and the suppliers of Southeast Asia is likely to [prevent it
from engaging in aggressive actions that would threaten these
relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline} China's priority is economic
modernization and development, **[[a goal that encourages cooperation
with its neighbors rather than conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
economic threat theory fails to consider the positive cooperation
building effects of China's growing trade with the world. China has
tried autarky and isolation from the world and it failed miserably from
1960 to 1978. [The other alternative, [trade and cooperation]{.mark}
with the world, has instead [brought enormous benefit and prosperity to
the country]{.mark}]{.underline}.37 China is therefore unlikely to risk
isolating itself from lucrative global markets by bullying its
neighbors. What also really worries the Right is what they claim to be a
Chinese economic strategy aimed at obtaining high and dual-use
technology, often using espionage to achieve its means, which will
inevitably provide a strategic threat to the US. This economic strength
is also feared to be financing PLA modernization. One strategy for
acquiring Western technology is requiring foreign companies to produce a
certain amount of the components of its products inside China. In so
doing, China is able to move up the learning curve and 'learn by doing'
as foreign companies train Chinese workers. One such example was a deal
between American owned McDonnell-Douglas and Chinese state-owned
Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation which required aircraft kits to
be assembled by Chinese workers in Chinese factories, involving 'One of
the largest technology transfers in history'.38 A further example
involves Boeing which allowed the tail sections of its planes to be
built in China, supplying the Chinese with technology that could be used
towards building military aircraft. Representative Christopher H. Smith
expressed his concern that Boeing's technology transfer was 'Giving
China the wherewithal to boost its military capacity. This technology
transfer is a very dangerous thing'.39 Technology is also transferred to
China by Chinese-owned California-based front companies in what Kenneth
Timmerman calls 'China's 22nd province'.40 technology transfer is a very
dangerous thing'.39 Technology is also transferred to China by

It is [often said that the '[end of the world']{.mark} is
[approaching]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[but]{.mark} [whose]{.mark} world,
exactly, is expected to end]{.underline}? Over the last several decades,
a [popular and increasingly influential literature on '**human
extinction'**, '**global catastrophic risks**', and
**[eco-apocalypse]{.mark}** has emerged]{.underline} in the social
sciences and popular culture. This rapidly growing body of knowledge is
produced by scientists, science journalists, policy-analysts, and
scholars of global affairs, all seeking to reach broad audiences and
influence international policy-making. Their central aim is to diagnose
the gravest global threats and to offer strategies to protect the future
of what they regard as 'humanity'. Yet, despite their claims to
universality, we argue that these 'end of the world'
[[discourses]{.mark} are more specifically [concerned]{.mark}
[about]{.mark} [protecting]{.mark} the [future of
**whiteness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although our primary aim in this
article is to diagnose these potentially destructive narratives, we also
engage with the rich and varied sphere of BIPOC2 (Black, Indigenous, and
People of Color) futurisms. These contributions challenge the perception
that there is no alternative to the apocalyptic futures imagined by
white scholars. They work to create plural worlds that vastly exceed
white visions of 'the' end of 'the world', embodying much wider,
diverse, and transformative concepts of, and beyond, 'humanity',
'nature', and 'the planet'. We view this article as a call for IR
scholars to recognize and engage these plural imaginaries, which contest
and perforate the boundaries of mainstream IR concepts such as
'humanity', 'agency', 'governance', 'threat', and 'harm'. As Amy Niang's
contribution to this special issue shows,3 those concepts are too often
constructed through forms of power that negate, oppress, and
super-exploit particular human bodies, societies, and ways of being.

Our analysis takes seriously this special issue's efforts toward
'thinking IR into the future', but with several important caveats.
First, we [reject the [Euro-centric]{.mark} notion that there is 'a' or
'the' single future -- just as we reject the notion of a single world,
now or ever.]{.underline} Such assumptions are at the [core of the
**mainstream** [apocalyptic]{.mark} [visions]{.mark}]{.underline} (and
their linear temporalities) that are increasing integral to IR
imaginaries at the 'turn' of the discipline's 'first century'. We
contend that the foundational and generative role of such imaginaries in
global power structures does not receive adequate attention in the field
of IR or in the broader social and natural sciences. As a result, their
[tendency to [narrow and **homogenize**]{.mark} the [futures]{.mark} of
worlds]{.underline}, plural, goes largely unchecked within the
discipline and its discourses. Yet [the white futurist discourses we
discuss are influential: they [aim to bring]{.mark} [about]{.mark} major
[shifts in]{.mark} global public consciousness and
**[policy-making]{.mark}** and strategy]{.underline}. They are often
accorded validation by the scientific credentials of their authors and
their embeddedness in large-scale data and modeling processes. Through
these means of public persuasion, such discourses have the potential to
shape concepts that are, and will likely continue to be, foundational to
IR: how threats are understood; the boundaries of 'humanity' and
'nonhumanity', and the distributions of harm across and beyond these
structures; and the forms of agency and governance demanded by, and
deemed acceptable within, a context of global crises. An
interdisciplinary IR concerned with interconnected global challenges --
the aspiration of this special issue -- needs to attend to how dominant
narratives and futural imaginaries cut off and sideline the concrete
presents and possible futures of plural Others. Second, where this
special issue asks 'how we should hold things together, conceptually,
empirically and disciplinarily' (see introduction, italics ours), we ask
what possibilities arise when current structures fall apart -- or,
indeed, are actively dismantled by the resurgence of worlds they seek to
oppress or erase. Far from seeing this scenario solely in terms of
catastrophe, as many of the narratives discussed in this article do, we
want to open up more conversation in IR about its emancipatory, creative
potential for the global connection between and amongst plural worlds.
With these aims in mind, we start by examining a number of salient and
influential works in the field addressing global crises, including
'global catastrophic risks' and 'human extinction', demonstrating how
they express anxiety for, and seek to protect whiteness. The second
section points to BIPOC futurisms that directly challenge the futures
circumscribed by whiteness and offer distinct forms of subjectivity,
temporality, and mobilities for responding to ongoing disaster.
Throughout, we focus on how futures are imagined, who imagines them and
with whose flourishing in mind in competing struggles for survival and
thriving in (post-) catastrophic worlds.

White subjectivities

[[Discourses]{.mark} that predict the imminent 'end of the world' are
[not]{.mark} as [universal]{.mark} as they often claim to
be]{.underline}. [The futures they fear]{.underline} for, seek to
protect and work to construct [are rooted in]{.underline} a particular
set of global social structures and subjectivities:
[whiteness]{.underline}. [Whiteness]{.underline} is not reducible to
skin pigmentation, genetics or genealogy. It is [a set of cultural,
political, economic, normative, and subjective structures derived from
Eurocentric societies and propagated through global formations such as
colonization and capitalism]{.underline}. These multi-scalar structures
work by segregating bodies through the inscription of racial difference,
privileging those they recognize or construct as 'white'4 and unequally
distributing harms to those that they do not.5 Whiteness is also a form
of property6 that accrues benefits -- including material, physical, and
other forms of security -- and pervasive forms of power, across space,
time, and social structures. Due in part to its trans-formation through
long-duration, global patterns of violence and conquest, whiteness takes
unique forms wherever and whenever it coalesces, so it should not be
treated as universal -- despite its own internal claims to this status.
Most of the leading contributors to mainstream 'end of the world'
discourses discussed in this article are rooted in Euro-American
cultural contexts, and in particular in settler colonial and/or imperial
states such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United
Kingdom. As such, [the forms of [whiteness they embody]{.mark} are
[linked to]{.mark} particular histories of [settlement]{.mark}, frontier
cultures**, [resource-based imperialisms]{.mark}**,
**[genocides]{.mark}** of Indigenous communities, histories of
**[slavery]{.mark}**, and modes of anti-Blackness.]{.underline}

Whiteness is remarkable in its ability to render itself invisible to
those who possess and benefit from it. Many, if not most, of the (often
liberal humanitarian) authors of 'end of the world' discourses seem
unaware of its integral influence on their thinking, and would almost
certainly be horrified at the thought of their work entrenching
racialized injustices. We are not suggesting that these authors espouse
explicit, intentional and/or extreme racist ideals, on which much public
discussion by white people of racism tends to focus.7 Nor do we wish to
homogenize or present as equivalent all of the viewpoints discussed in
this paper, which display a range of expressions of whiteness and levels
of awareness thereof.8 On the contrary, we work to center broad,
everyday, structural ways in which underlying logics of whiteness and
white supremacy frame and permeate mainstream paradigms and discourses,
including those identified as liberal, humanitarian, or progressive.
Even amongst white people who consciously and explicitly disavow racism,
unconscious, habitual, normalized, structurally-embedded assumptions
circulate, and are reproduced in ways that perpetuate race9 as a global
power structure. This includes one of the authors of this paper
(Mitchell), who, as a white settler,10 continues to benefit from and
participate -- and thus 'invest'11 -- in structures of whiteness, and
therefore has a continual responsibility to confront them (although
total divestment is not possible).12

The 'habits' of racism13 are reflected strongly in the way that
[contemporary 'end of the world' narratives frame their
protagonists]{.underline}: those attributed with meaningful agency and
ethical status in the face of global threats; those whose survival or
flourishing is prioritized or treated as a bottom line when tradeoffs
are imagined and planned; and, crucially, [those deemed capable of and
entitled to 'save the world' and determine its future]{.underline}. This
is expressed in several key features of the genre, including its
[domination by white thinkers]{.underline}; the forms of subjectivity
and agency it embraces; and the ways it contrasts its subjects against
BIPOC communities.

First, [[contributors]{.mark} [to]{.mark} fast-growing fields like the
study of '**[existential risk']{.mark}** or 'global catastrophic risk'
[are]{.mark} overwhelmingly white]{.underline}. As we will see, almost
all of the authors identified by the literature review on which this
paper is based, and certainly the most influential thinkers in the
field, are white. For example, the seminal collection Global Existential
Risk, 14 which claims to offer a comprehensive snapshot of this field,
is edited by two white male Europeans (Nick Bostrom and Milan Circovic)
and authored by an almost entirely white (and all-male) group of
scholars. Likewise, the most senior positions within influential think
tanks promoting the study of 'existential risk', such as the Future of
Humanity Institute, the Cambridge Center for the Study of Existential
Risk and Humanprogress.org, are dominated by white men, with few
exceptions.15 Another expression of this [[tend]{.mark}ency
[toward]{.mark} **[epistemic whiteness]{.mark}**]{.underline} is found
in the habit, prominent amongst white academics, of citing all or
mostly-white scholars, which entrenches a politics of citation16 that
privileges whiteness and acknowledges only some intersectionalities as
relevant.17 As mentioned above, Mitchell's (2017)18 work offers an
example of this tendency: while it engages critical, feminist, and queer
postapocalyptic visions written by white authors, it does not center
BIPOC perspectives or knowledge systems.

These examples do not simply raise issues of numerical representation,
nor can whiteness necessarily be dismantled simply by altering these
ratios. More importantly, all-white or majority white spaces create
epistemes in which most contributors share cultural backgrounds,
assumptions, and biases that are rarely challenged by alternative
worldviews, knowledge systems or registers of experience. In such
epistemes the perceived boundaries of 'human thought' are often elided
with those of Euro-centric knowledge. For example, influential American
settler journalist David Wallace-Wells19 contends that there exists no
framework for grasping climate change besides 'mythology and theology'.
In so doing, he ignores centuries of ongoing, systematic observation and
explicit articulations of concern by BIPOC knowledge keepers about
climactic change. The bracketing of BIPOC knowledges not only severely
limits the rigor of discourses on global crises, but also, as bi-racial
organizer and thinker adrienne maree brown20 argues, it produces
distorted outcomes. For instance, it smuggles normative judgments that
'turn Brown bombers into terrorists and white bombers into mentally ill
victims' into apparently 'objective' claims. Similarly, the influential
work of Black American criminologist Ruth Wilson Gilmore21 demonstrates
how white imaginaries of the threat posed by BIPOC bodies has produced
the massive global penal complex and the radically unequal distribution
of life chances. In short, imaginaries create worlds, so it matters
greatly whose are privileged, and whose are excluded.

[Further, emerging narratives of the 'end of the world' explicitly
[center]{.mark} [figures of **whiteness**]{.mark} [as]{.mark} their
**[protagonists]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [as [the]{.mark}
[survivors]{.mark} of apocalypse, the subjects capable of saving the
world from it, and as those most threatened]{.underline}. In these
discourses, '[survivors' are framed as saviors [able to]{.mark}
[protect]{.mark} and/or regenerate and even improve [Western]{.mark}
forms of [governance]{.mark}]{.underline} and social order by leveraging
resilience, scientific prowess, and technological genius. For example,
the cover of American settler scientists Tony Barnosky and Elizabeth
Hadley's book Tipping Points for Planet Earth features a stylized male
'human' whom they identify as former California governor Jerry Brown (a
powerful white settler politician) holding the earth back from rolling
over a cliff.22 Similarly, presenting a thought experiment about the
planet's future, Homer-Dixon23 asks his readers to imagine 'an average
male -- call him John' (in fact, the most popular male name globally at
the time of writing was Mohammed). This is followed by images of a
Caucasian male dressed in safari or hiking gear -- both emblematic of
symbols colonial conquest24 -- tasked with choosing from two forks on a
path, as imagined by white American poet Robert Frost. This image of
rugged masculine whiteness, embodied in physical strength, colonial
prowess, and the ability to dominate difficult landscapes is mirrored in
his framing of his former co-workers on oil rigs in the Canadian
prairies25 as models of resilience. Similarly, American settler science
writer Annalee Newitz26 proposes the Canadian province of Saskatchewan
as a 'model for human survival', based on her perceptions of the
resilience, persistence and collaborative frontier attitudes of its
people. Saskatchewan is a notoriously racist part of Canada, in which
violence against Indigenous people continues to be integral to its
white-dominated culture27 -- yet this polity and its culture are held up
by Newitz as a model of 'human' resilience. [By imagining subjects in
whom whiteness is elided with resilience and survival, these
[discourses]{.mark} not only [normalize]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[obscure]{.mark} the modes of [**violence** and **oppression**]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} [which]{.mark} perceived 'resilience' -- or, in blunt
terms, preferential [**access to survival** -- is
achieved]{.mark}]{.underline}. They also work to displace the threat of
total destruction 'onto others who are seen as lacking the
resourcefulness of the survivor'.28

In addition, many '[end of the world' narratives interpellate subjects
of white privilege by [assuming]{.mark} that [readers are not]{.mark}
(currently) [affected]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the harms distributed
unequally by global structures of **[environmental
racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For instance, Barnosky and Hadley29
(italics ours) state, 'if you are anything like we are, you probably
think of pollution as somebody else's problem. . . you probably don't
live near a tannery, mine dump or any other source of pollution'. For
many people of color, living near a source of pollution may be nearly
inescapable as a result of structural-material discrimination, including
zoning practices and the accessibility of housing.30 [Viewing ecological
harms as 'someone else's problem' is a privilege afforded to those who
have never been forced contemplate the destruction of their communities
or **worlds**]{.underline}.31 At the same time, these authors -- along
with many others working in the genre -- [[invoke]{.mark}
[narratives]{.mark} [akin to]{.mark}]{.underline} 'all lives matter' or
'[[**colour-blindness**'32]{.mark} that erase unequal distributions of
harm and threat]{.underline}. For instance, during their international
travels for scientific research and leisure, Barnosky and Hadley
(italics ours) describe a dawning awareness that 'the problems we were
writing about. . . were everybody's problems. . .no one was escaping the
impacts. . . including us'. They go on to frame as equivalent flooding
in Pakistan that displaced 20 million people and killed 2000 with the
inconveniences caused by the temporary flooding of the New York subway
system in 2012. In addition, they cite evidence of endocrine disruption
in American girls caused by pollution, stating that the youngest of the
cohort are African American and Latina but that 'the most dramatic
increase is in Caucasian girls'33 (italics ours). In this framing, even
though BIPOC children remain most adversely affected, white children are
pushed to the foreground and framed as more urgently threatened in
relative terms. These comparisons background the disproportionate burden
of ecological harm born by BIPOC, and reflect a stark calculus of the
relative value of white and BIPOC lives. The 'all lives matter' logic
employed here constructs 'a universal human frailty'34 in which
responsibility for ecological threats is attributed to 'humans' in
general, and the assignment of specific culpability is avoided. While
Newitz avers that 'assigning blame \[for ecological harm\] is less
important than figuring out how to. . . survive',35 we argue that
[accurately attributing responsibility is crucial to opening up futures
in which it is possible to dismantle the structural oppressions that
**unequally distribute harms** and chances for **collective
survival.**]{.underline}

[Preoccupation with the subjects of whiteness in 'end of the world'
discourses]{.underline} is also reflected in the framing of BIPOC
communities as threats to the survival of 'humanity'. These fears are
perhaps most simply and [starkly expressed in anxieties over population
decline within predominantly **white countries**]{.underline}, paired
with palpable fear of rising birth rates amongst BIPOC communities.
Chillingly, such [fears are often connected to the mere biological
survival of BIPOC]{.underline}, and the reproductive capacities of Black
and Brown bodies -- especially those coded as 'female', and therefore
'fertile' within colonial gender binaries.36 For instance, in his
treatise on 'over'-population, American settler science writer Alan
Weisman addresses the 'problem' raised by the likely significant
increase of survival rates (especially amongst children) as a result of
widely-available cures for illnesses such as malaria or HIV. Since, he
avers, it would be 'unconscionable' to withhold these vaccines, Weisman
suggests that malaria and HIV research funding should also promote
family planning -- that is, control of BIPOC fertility -- since 'there's
no vaccine against extinction'.37 Here, BIPOC survival and
reproductivity is literally -- even if not strictly intentionally --
framed as an incurable disease that could culminate in 'extinction'.
Although some of these discussions examine total growth in human
populations globally,38 much of this research focuses on relative
population sizes, usually of BIPOCmajority places to those inscribed as
white. For instance, British doctor John Guillebaud predicts a 'birth
dearth' in Europe while likening 'unremitting population growth' in
other parts of the world to 'the doctrine of the cancer cell'.39
Although these regions are described in various ways throughout the
genre -- for instance, as 'poor' or 'developing', the areas slated for
growth are almost always BIPOC-majority. For example, Hungarian
demographer Paul Demeny (italics ours) argues that Europe's population
is steadily shrinking 'while nearby populations explode'.40 Drawing on
Demeny's work, HomerDixon warns of a future 3:1 demographic ratio
between North Africa/West Asia and Europe, along with 70% growth in
Bangladesh, 140% growth in Kenya, and a doubling of the populations of
Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Directly after sharing these
statistics, he appends a list of international news reports referring
to, for example, clashes between Indigenous communities in Kenya, riots
in Shanghai, and murder rates in Mexico.41 In so doing, he directly
juxtaposes BIPOC population growth with stereotypes of violence and
'incivility'.

[[BIPOC]{.mark} are often [represented]{.mark} in these narratives [as
embodiments of ecological collapse]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [threat]{.mark},
embedding the [assumption]{.mark} [that]{.mark} 'black people don't care
about the environment',42 and that the [global 'poor']{.mark} will
always [prioritize]{.mark} short-term [economic needs above e**cological
concerns**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [belief is reflected in
travelogue-style descriptions of ecological devastation]{.underline},
including Barnosky and Hadley's musings, while on holiday in Utah, that
the ancient Puebloan society collapsed because they had run out of water
-- a situation which they project onto future Sudan, Somalia, and Gaza.
In addition, they diagnose the fall of what they call the 'extinct'
Mayan community to overpopulation and over-exploitation of resources --
despite the survivance43 of over 6 million Mayan people in their
Ancestral lands and other places at the time of writing.44 These
descriptions chime with the common refrain on the part of settler states
that BIPOC are unable to care properly for their land, even in the
absence of conflicting data. This constructed ignorance allows those
states to frame BIPOC territories as 'wasteland' awaiting annexation or
improvement, or as dumping grounds for the externalities of
capitalism.45 What's more, [the use of BIPOC communities as cautionary
tales for planetary destruction strongly [suggests]{.mark} that the
[redistribution of global]{.mark} [power]{.mark}, [land
ownership]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} other forms of [agency]{.mark} toward
BIPOC structures would [result in **ecological
disaster**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Energy Security 

#### The Neg's focus on Energy Security diverts attention from the epistemic violence of Energy Colonialism and prevents colonial investigation of energy practices

Dr. Franziska **Müller '24** \[PhD, Chair of International Development

energy justice, energy colonialism, hydrogen production, political
ecology, and politics of ecosystemic survival in the Anthropocene.
"Energy Colonialism". Grassroots -- Journal of Political Ecology Vol.
31, 2024.\] BC

[[Combining]{.underline}]{.mark} these [four [lenses]{.mark} --
materialist, socio-psychological, political ecology, and
abolitionist]{.underline} -- [[gives an impression of]{.mark}
[how]{.mark} the concept of [energy colonialism serves as a]{.mark}
critical research [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} combining scholarly and
activist ambitions [[to denounce controversial energy projects]{.mark},
policies, or infrastructures]{.underline}. Yet, maybe with the exception
of the political ecology perspective, it is striking that many works
that engage with energy colonialism are not guided by a multiscalar
understanding of colonialism/coloniality, which limits their analytical
value. In addition, while a political ecology and a psychosocial
perspective broadly reflect on resistance and social protest,
abolitionist perspectives are centered on this emancipatory view. On a
more abstract level, we can discern among them, four significant gaps:
historical (1), epistemic and discursive (2), (geo)political and
governance (3), and sociocultural (4). (1) [All four lenses concentrate
on]{.underline} recent cases, particularly [large-scale RE or
infrastructural projects]{.underline}. In contrast, [we find much less
engagement with]{.underline} the longstanding traces of [energy
colonialism and their repercussions]{.underline} on today\'s political
economy of energy in postcolonial states. Typical cases are dam
projects, such as those in Ghana or Zambia; furthermore, the Desertec
project builds on older narratives, such as the \"Eurafrica\" myth
(Hansen & Jonsson, 2014). **[This [lack of a historical dimension means
that the effects of]{.mark} [colonization processes in the energy
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., energy infrastructures or fossilist
dependencies) **[[are mostly invisible, and that the long shadow of
power relations and their \"slow violence\" has not been]{.mark}
sufficiently [considered for the energy sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(for the few exceptions, see Cropper, 2022; Mavhunga & Trischler, 2014;
Stock, 2022). [This includes the connection of large-scale energy
infrastructures to problematic understandings of \"under\"development
and energy poverty]{.underline}. (2) So far, [existing
works]{.underline} have [focused on the materialities of energy
economies]{.underline}, infrastructures, or projects, yet **[[there is a
lack of engagement with the epistemic]{.mark} or discursive [dimension
of energy and energy transitions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This refers to
the role of energy knowledge and how this is framed in the form of
\"white magic\" (Girvan, 1978), bringing Western progress and modernity
to \"under\"developed regions. Furthermore, the challenges of knowledge
transfer, [hierarchies of energy knowledge systems, and [epistemic
violence need to be addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Postcolonial
science/technology studies (Barthel, 2019; McNeil, 2015) operate in this
sphere. (3) Furthermore, **[[given the dominance of the \"energy
security\" norm in policymaking]{.mark} and the impact of military
doctrines on the political economy of energy and on energy transitions,
[there is a need to reflect on the rise of civil-military complexes and
geopolitical desires in the field of energy]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[Post- and decolonial theory should intensify its engagement with the
power geographies of energy]{.underline}**]{.mark} and their political
dimension, exploring the current hydrogen expansion, lithium
extractivism, and new green geopolitics, including deep-sea mining.
[[The modes of global a]{.mark}nd [transnational energy]{.mark}
governance that we currently see evolving in parallel with the rise of a
multipolar world order also [need investigation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Reawakened desires in Southern production zones and the energy
partnerships that materialize from these desires redefine energy
politics as a transnational project laden with colonial continuities.
(4) Debates on energy transition also cover the socio-cultural dimension
of energy technologies, yet [a connection with critical perspectives
stemming from postcolonial technoscience or energy humanities is seldom
made]{.underline} (Barthel, 2019; Boamah & Rothfuß, 2018; McNeil, 2005).
[This would include a critical discussion of concepts such as \"energy
poverty\" or \"energy literacy,\" which may stabilize epistemic
dichotomies]{.underline} of development/\"under\"development, for
example. [Current [debates]{.mark}]{.underline} on \"energycultures\"
(Stephenson et al., 2010) [would [need to reflect]{.mark}]{.underline}
on [[the ways in which Western technologies are adopted or rejected by
societies and which colonial or neocolonial repercussions underpin
them]{.underline}]{.mark}, including perspectives on the \"energy
subjectivities\" that are created along the course of transition
processes.

### 2AC \-\-- Existential Risk \-\-- Offense

#### Existential risk analysis is founded on [impossible statistics]{.underline} steeped in bias and justifies [genocide]{.underline}.

The [[field]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [existential]{.mark} [risk]{.mark}
[combines]{.mark} **[util]{.mark}itarianism** [and]{.mark}
[probabilistic]{.mark} [risk analysis]{.mark} toward a fortuitous "ok"
outcome]{.underline} (Bostrom's "maxipok"). On the one hand, existential
risk analysts aim at the [utilitarian goal]{.underline} of establishing
the greatest good for the greatest number. On the other hand, they seek
to [use mathematical probability models to estimate the chance that a
given cause will lead to the extinction of humanity]{.underline}, or
even of life in general.2 [The crux of existential risk analysis is the
synthesis of these two modes of calculative reasoning. But this crux is
also a failure: as we show in this section, existential risk analysis is
[constituted]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a [radical mismatch]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [method and object of study]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
mismatch [leads to a comic effect:]{.underline} the wonderfully strange
spectacle of serious philosophers (Bostrom), scientists (Sir Martin
Rees), and entrepreneurs (Elon Musk) [discussing how to mitigate the
risk of deep future extinction events as though they were calculating
the probability that one will die in a car accident based on ample
statistics about the frequency of such events in the past]{.underline}.
The effect is similar to that of Michael Madsen's documentary Into
Eternity, when we watch engineers become speculative philosophers as
they ponder the one hundred thousand-year time frame of their deep
geological repository for storing nuclear waste, especially when Madsen
asks them what human societies might be like in such a distant future.3
What Mark McGurl calls "posthuman comedy" is here the effect of rational
solutions applied to cover over the unthinkable, unimaginable, and
uncontrollable otherness of any future that stretches beyond a few human
generations.4

Existential risk veers from "comic" analyses of extremely remote
scenarios, such as the "aestivation hypothesis" (aliens are sleeping so
as to wait billions of years for the universe to cool down enough to run
cosmic-size computers), to "tragic" assessments of the high near-term
likelihood of some massive extinction-inducing event that would be
predictable but not avoidable.5 If we were to start calculating the
probability that a climate tipping point or AI will bring an end to our
evolutionary line, then not only would we be unable to arrive at a
reliable estimate that bears any analogy with, for example, finance or
insurance risk analysis, [we wouldn't even know if the event is possible
in the first place]{.underline}. [[We]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
[trying]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [estimate]{.mark} the [probability]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [something that can only happen **once**]{.mark},
[without]{.mark} [any]{.mark} [evidence]{.mark} to go on.]{.underline}
Not only that, [we would be trying to use this knowledge to act in a way
that will **prevent it** from happening. Or at least, because
existential risk analysis operates within a fundamentally probabilistic
universe, the aim is to lower the fatal event's probability: the closer
to zero, the more immune humanity's potential will have
been.]{.underline}

For some, this might already be enough to dismiss the idea of rational
study of remote existential risk scenarios. As one AI researcher
reports, "I don't worry about \[AI induced extinction\] for the same
reason I don't worry about overpopulation on Mars."6 There is a
common-sense idea that [[we should not]{.mark} [spend]{.mark} too much
[time]{.mark} [or]{.mark} too many [resources]{.mark} [to
prevent]{.mark} [something]{.mark} when [we **don't know** ]{.mark}**if
[it's possible]{.mark}**]{.underline} (though Bostrom and others would
remind us that common sense is what prevents us from seeing the
implications of probability theory clearly enough to act). As our
characterization of existential risk's model of probability and
utilitarianism suggests, we [[lean toward **skepticism**]{.mark} about
the field's claim to **rationality and scientific rigor**]{.underline}.
For readers steeped in critical theory, such a quantitative approach to
politics, ethics, and extinction may look to be another chapter of the
dialectic of Enlightenment, bound to end badly. But [the
**epistemological assumptions** of existential risk should **attract
greater attention and critique**---not dismissal as another overreach of
rationalism, but analysis and historicization.]{.underline}

The Rhetoric of Probability

Writing for Vox, journalist Dylan Matthews covered the Effective
Altruism Global Conference at the Google campus in Mountain View,
California, in the summer of 2015. The title of his article---"I Spent a
Weekend at Google Talking to Nerds about Charity. I Came Away . . .
Worried"---divulges his take on the ideas and affects that circulated at
the meeting.7 "Effective altruism" is the philanthropic practice of
attempting to do the greatest good through means that are efficient and
data-driven rather than sentimental. Many in the existential risk
community also subscribe to the effective altruism movement, such as
philosopher Toby Ord, founder of the society Giving What We Can (a group
admirably committed to donating at least 10 percent of income). In
Oxford, Bostrom's Future of Humanity Institute shares office space with
the Centre for Effective Altruism. Effective altruists see themselves
embracing "the cold, hard data necessary to prove what actually does
good."8 This makes the movement a candidate for study from the
perspective of science and technology studies, as an ethical philosophy
that claims for itself scientific imprimatur. Matthews says that he
identifies as an effective altruist; he also admits that "EA is very
white, very male, and dominated by tech industry workers."9 The topic of
existential risk occupied center stage at the conference in 2015, and it
gave him pause even as someone who embraces quantitative ethics.

Matthews's skeptical account of this "X-risk" takeover is a good example
of how existential risk combines fantastical, deep-time probability
calculations with utilitarian ethics. In the example he cites, a panel
featuring Bostrom and Musk, the starting point for determining the
greatest good for the greatest number of persons was to calculate the
greatest number of lives. The presenters did so not with respect to a
narrow time frame, as in the greatest number alive on Earth today or
during a 100-year period. Instead, they reasoned that if humanity lasts
"another 50 million years," then "the total number of humans who will
ever live is . . . 3 quadrillion."10 But they went on to decide that
this number fails to take into account future extraterrestrial
inhabitants of the solar system, "the potential value of our posthuman
future," or what Phil Torres calls the "astronomical value thesis."11
Given the same arbitrary time scale of 50 million years, they concluded
that the number of people we need to take into account is more like 1052
lives of 100 years each---a vastly greater number than 3 quadrillion, so
much greater that the mathematical notation for exponents seems more
accessible than obscure words like sexdecillion.

Bostrom then shifts from such uncountable numbers to discussing the
ethical implications for us today: "Even if we give this 1054 estimate
'a mere 1% chance of being correct,' . . . we find that the expe[cted
[value]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [reducing]{.mark} existential [risk]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} a mere [**one billionth** of **one billionth** of **one
percent**]{.mark}**age** point [is]{.mark} [worth]{.mark} a [hundred
billion]{.mark} [times as much as]{.mark}]{.underline} a billion human
lives."12 As Matthews continues to paraphrase,

the number of future humans who will never exist if humans go extinct is
so great that reducing the risk of extinction by 0.00000000000000001
percent can be expected to save 100 billion more lives than, say,
[[preventing]{.mark} the [**genocide** of 1 billion
people]{.mark}]{.underline}. That argues, in the judgment of Bostrom and
others, for prioritizing efforts to prevent human extinction above other
endeavors. This is what X-risk obsessives mean when they claim ending
world poverty would be a "rounding error."13

Since we read this article, we have mentioned Matthews's rather
satirical report to a number of friends and colleagues. Their reaction
is always amusement at the comical absurdity of this scenario. They are
right, in a sense, but in this case the reductio ad absurdum of
deep-time utilitarianism is strange because it is also perfectly
rational, if "rational" means consistent with the concepts thinkers like
Bostrom have applied. Notwithstanding their highly speculative
assumptions about the time scale of fifty million years and
interplanetary travel, the numbers reported by Matthews are faithfully
deduced by combining probability theory with the first principle of the
mathematical ethics of utilitarianism, even if the greatest "good" is
reduced to mere existence for the greatest number. This is the
"effective" side of effective altruism, now stretched to an unimaginable
future.

In another example, Bostrom offers a box essay in Superintelligence
about the human lives and happiness that are really at stake when it
comes to the risk of malevolent AI. Different from Matthews's example,
he adds a quantification of happiness that goes beyond the negative
value of avoiding the foreclosure of countless future lives:

Assuming that the observable universe is void of extraterrestrial
civilizations, then what hangs in the balance is at least 10,000,000,00
0,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ,000 human
lives. . . . If we represent all the happiness experienced during one
entire such life with a single teardrop of joy, then the happiness of
these souls could fill and refill the Earth's oceans every second, and
keep doing so for a hundred billion billion millennia. It is really
important that we make sure these truly are tears of joy.14

This [**[implied]{.mark} [util]{.mark}itarian [calculus]{.mark}**
[stretches]{.mark} the [limits]{.mark}]{.underline}, to put it mildly,
[[of]{.mark} **any known means** of [deciding]{.mark} [how we should
act]{.mark}]{.underline}, what is right and wrong, and how to calculate
the odds of a given extinction. Yet they remain calculations. They have
a certain rationality despite the absurd ambition. They also provide the
foundations for a normative prescription for action, even if it reads
slightly tongue-in-cheek given the image of an ocean filled with tears
of joy. [The aspiration here is to make an ethics of extinction
avoidance rational by grounding it in the relation between probability
of a given risk and the idea that doing the right thing means dividing
the total amount of total happiness]{.underline}, now and in the future,
by the total number of humans. [[Working]{.mark} [with]{.mark} such
**[vast numbers]{.mark}** is what [gives]{.mark} the [idea]{.mark} that
[even slightly lowering]{.mark} the [probability]{.mark} [of]{.mark} an
[extinction]{.mark} event is [worth]{.mark}
"**[astronomically]{.mark}**" [more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} [any]{.mark}
**[justice]{.mark} achieved** in the present.]{.underline}

Another example of Bostrom's use of probability appears in the first
chapter of Superintelligence, where he posits that AI will reach
human-level intelligence during our century. In this case, the evidence
with which to calculate such probabilities comes secondhand from surveys
of AI experts recalibrated by Bostrom. Rather than probabilities
calculated on the basis of known conditions such as the two sides of a
coin or all the data about car accidents used by insurance companies, we
have researchers guessing at probabilities, other researchers averaging
them out, and Bostrom reporting the results. So he is right to admit
that

[**[small sample sizes]{.mark}**, **selection [biases]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark}---]{.underline}above all---the **[inherent
[unreliability]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the subjective opinions
elicited [[mean]{.mark} that [one should]{.mark} [not
read]{.mark}]{.underline} too much [[into]{.mark} these [expert]{.mark}
[surveys]{.mark}]{.underline} and interviews. They do not let us draw
any strong conclusion. But they do [hint at a **weak
conclusion**]{.underline}. They suggest that (at least in lieu of better
data or analysis) it may be reasonable to believe that human-level
machine intelligence has a fairly sizeable chance of being developed by
mid-century, and that it has a non-trivial chance of being developed
considerably sooner or much later; that it might perhaps fairly soon
thereafter result in superintelligence; and that a wide range of
outcomes may have a significant chance of occurring, including extremely
good outcomes and outcomes that are as bad as human extinction. At the
very least, they suggest that the topic is worth a closer look.15

Bostrom rhetorically [hedges several layers of
**uncertainty**]{.underline}, writing not just that we should take the
numbers with a grain of salt, but that a "weak conclusion" "suggests"
that it "may be reasonable" to believe in a "fairly sizeable" chance of
the development of humanlevel AI, "which might perhaps fairly soon"
become superintelligent, which could then mean a "significant chance" of
human extinction alongside the more neutral and optimistic
possibilities. This [rhetoric of probability does not amount to anything
very different from an **unguided estimate**.]{.underline} More
generously, we can say that the changing opinions of experts allow for
guesses that are easier to trust secondhand, and that these guesses can
be updated as new evidence arrives. Yet they remain guesses about
several things that we do not know to be possible in the first place.

There would seem to be a qualitative difference between such
"probabilities" (if this is still the right term) that involve educated
guesses and secondhand surveys, and the kind of probabilistic risk
analysis that, though its conclusions remain uncertain, is able to use
data about real past events to calculate a probability. Surveying the
expert community can tell us the probability that a given expert will
believe in human extinction by AI, not the probability of the event
itself. Given Bostrom's hedging, we are not just dealing with
uncertainty but, what is more abstract, rhetorical play with uncertainty
about uncertainty. We would have to be very generous readers to grant
that there is some truth to these forecasts when the author is
explicitly telling us not to read much into them. Given the
[[fundamentally]{.mark} [speculative]{.mark} nature of extinction
scenarios]{.underline}, such guesswork is understandable. The
[[problem]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [it is]{.mark} also [treated
as "**scientific**]{.mark}" [and "**rational**" grounds]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} political [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}---even as the only
grounds worth mentioning.

Stepping Back from the Precipice

A similar problem is found in Toby Ord's use of ostensibly Bayesian
probability in his recent book The Precipice. Ord's analysis draws on a
form of probability theory that, in Ian Hacking's words, "offers a way
to represent rational change in belief, in light of new evidence."16 For
Hacking, Bayesian theory matters most to "personal probability" or
"belief-type probability." It is a way of formalizing the process of
updating one's beliefs---or guesses about probability--- by learning
from experience. The basic idea is that given Pr(H1 ) as a "prior
probability," new evidence E will give a posterior probability, Pr(H1
/E). The process is iterative. The posterior probability can be fed back
into the equation as a new value for H, and evaluated again in terms of
new evidence, and so on. There are further complexities that we leave
aside. The point is that new evidence is necessary for this looping
process that offers a good way to incorporate prior beliefs---that is,
to avoid the blunt tool of an empiricism that claims to think only with
firsthand sensory evidence. Like Bostrom, Ord is discussing the
probability of AI-caused human extinction, but in the context of a
general chapter about "quantifying risks" in the twenty-first century
"risk landscape," so his statements about method apply to the field's
basic model as well. For Ord, the greatest risk in the next hundred
years comes from AI. He rates the risk of extinction at one in ten, then
notes that such a high number for such a "speculative risk" needs more
explanation:

A common approach to estimating the chance of an unprecedented event
with earth-shaking consequences is to take a skeptical stance: to start
with an extremely small probability and only raise it from there when a
large amount of hard evidence is presented. But I disagree. Instead, I
think the right method is to start with a probability that reflects our
overall impressions, then adjust in light of scientific evidence. When
there is a lot of evidence, these approaches converge. But when there
isn't, the starting point can matter.17

In an endnote to this passage, Ord goes on to explain that this approach
to probability theory is Bayesian: it entails "starting with a prior and
updating in light of the evidence," and the starting point matters.18
Like Bostrom, he bases the updating calculation on "the overall view of
the expert community that there is something like a one in two chance
that AI agents capable of outperforming humans in almost every task will
be developed in the coming century."19 Unlike Bostrom, Ord does not
include numbers from surveys or a citation, but he asks us to take his
word about the AI expert's beliefs, then to accept his leap from the
idea of human-level AI to AI as an extinction threat. While all of this
is cast in the language of Bayesian updating, the Bayesian calculations
themselves are promissory---as they must be given that we have no
evidence to fill the variable "E" and temper our initial beliefs. So
Ord's calculations are based on his own beliefs as an existential risk
theorist and on the opinions of the uncited experts; Bostrom's
calculations are based on his own beliefs and the average of a small
sample of expert opinion. Arguably these probabilities are all prior.
The authors give lip service to a Bayesianism that cannot be
operationalized by definition for an unprecedented event.20

One could imagine a situation in which these ideas were more innocently
speculative, so that the effort to treat guesswork as a foundation would
be less problematic. But the mixture of utilitarianism and the rhetoric
of probability that forms the field's basic model entails norms about
what should be done in the present to mitigate existential risks. These
[promissory probabilities and their norms don't take place in a
political-economic vacuum]{.underline}, isolated from practice. The
Future of Humanity Institute, The Future of Life Institute, and the
Centre for the [[Study]{.mark} [of Existential]{.mark}
[Risk]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[received]{.mark} considerable
[funding]{.mark}]{.underline}, interest, and participation [[from **tech
billionaires**]{.underline}]{.mark}. YouTube videos by Bostrom are
widely viewed. As their institutional and media footprints suggest, this
field is not at all shy about capturing attention and funding. After
offering his belief-type probabilities, Ord argues that humanity has a
1/6 chance of extinction over the next hundred years, and lowering this
number should be "a key global priority."21 All [five of the major
existential risks--- **nuclear war**, **climate change**, other
**environmental damage**, **AI**, and **designed pandemics**---"warrant
major global efforts on the grounds of their contribution to existential
risk"]{.underline} (169). But the long menu of "minor" extinction risks
merits major action as well. Given that the destruction of "humanity's
entire potential" would be "so much worse than World War II," Ord
suggests that it would be justifiable to create a global body for
mitigating total existential risk by analogy with the UN. Another
possibility is to "create a body modeled on the IPCC, but aimed at
assessing existential risk as a whole."22 For existential risk
theorists, then, the policy and budgetary changes based on their
rhetoric of probability ought to be dramatic and immediate. And when it
comes to the popular nonacademic writings and declarations, the
promissory calculations recede even further into the background, from
appendices and box essays to gestures about the future of the field.
Perhaps this is where the rhetoric of probability becomes most
problematic. Given the public-facing nature of existential risk, this
problem can hardly be seen as a necessary side effect of simplifying
specialist work. Quite simply, the core practice of the field is not
calculation but commentary about future calculation with normative
weight in the present.

[[Radical]{.mark} political [change]{.mark} is [**needed** to
ease]{.mark} the [effects]{.mark} [of]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline} and preserve biodiversity, [even if they
are not extinction risks to humanity]{.underline}. But [existential risk
studies take such a **bird's eye view** of humanity that it is incapable
of intervening in a context of austerity measures for education and
public services, systemic racism, and extreme, worsening class
inequality, among other social problems]{.underline}. So these [genuine
proposals for a massive expansion of [existential]{.mark} [risk]{.mark}
[mitigation]{.mark} must [compete]{.mark} [with]{.mark} other [sorely
needed]{.mark} [fields]{.mark} that are [at]{.mark} constant
[risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[being defunded]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
the university space, [existential risk studies gather steam and
**institutional support** while austerity reigns for traditional
humanities disciplines]{.underline} as well as for more recent fields
[like **critical race** studies]{.underline} that educate people about
human histories of oppression [in a time of nationalist and
white-supremacist reaction]{.underline}. The coronavirus pandemic has
highlighted the racial inequality of infection and death rates just as
it has shown the need for radical change in our agro-industrial food
systems. [We need research at multiple scales across the sciences and
humanities into these existentially crushing structures of
oppression]{.underline}, [how current relations between cultures and
natures became disempowering for so many]{.underline}, and how both can
change in the near future.

[**[Existential risk analysis is not risk
analysis]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This statement is only slightly
hyperbolic. To be fair, there are some cases where calculating rough
probabilities of planetary extinction seems possible. The frequently
cited example is asteroid strikes. But even Ord admits the theoretical
limits inherent in calculating the probabilities of unprecedented
events---especially the kind that, by definition, would leave no
survivors to perform Bayesian updates. From Bostrom and Ćirković's early
Global Catastrophic Risk to the growing archive of relevant papers on
the website of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, our reading
suggests that [there is very little actionable probabilistic risk
analysis going on in this field.]{.underline} Perhaps this is due to
conceptual incoherence: the study of existential risk is founded on an
impossible data point. [Most of the extinction events that form its core
object of study are **simply not tractable**]{.underline} in its model.
We can study extinction through other methods, but [we cannot estimate
the probability of most extinction events---especially the kind that
matter most to these theorists, which are the "humancaused" or
technological ones over which "we" would seem to have the most
agency.]{.underline}

to with philosophies of state and corporate land-grabbing24. The
prominence of "flat world" perspectives asserts that technology has
afforded a diminished significance of place and borders. The claim is
that U.S. borders have become more flexible, yet simultaneously, the
physical border has become more absolute and enforced. The border is no
longer just a line suturing two nation-states; the U.S. now polices its
borders interior to its territory and exercises sovereignty throughout
the globe. Just as sovereignty has expanded, so has settler colonialism
in partial forms. New Orleans' lower ninth ward lies at the confluence
of river channels and gulf waters, and at the intersection of land
grabbing and human bondage. The collapsing of levies heralded the
selective collapsibility of native-slave, again, for the purpose of
reinvasion, resettlement, reinhabitation. The naturalized disaster of
Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters laid the perfect cover for land
speculation and the ablution of excess people. What can't be absorbed,
can't be folded in (because the settlers won\'t give up THEIR land to
advance abolition), translates into bodies stacked on top of one another
in public housing and prisons, in cells, kept from the labor market,
making labor for others (guards and other corrections personnel) making
money for states -human homesteading. It necessitates the manufacturing
of crime at rates higher than anywhere in the world. 1 in 6 people in
the state of Louisiana are incarcerated, the highest number of caged
people per capita, making it the prison capital of United States, and
therefore the prison capital of the world. The Yazoo and Mississippi
Rivers' delta flood plain was once land so fertile that it could be
squeezed for excess production of cotton, giving rise to exceptionally
large-scale plantation slavery. Plantation owners lived in houses like
pyramids and chattel slavery took an extreme form here, even for the
South, beginning with enslaved Chitimachas, Choctaw, Natchez,
Chaoüachas, Natchez, Westo, Yamasee, Euchee, Yazoo and Tawasa peoples,
then later replaced by enslaved West Africans. Literally, worked to
death. This "most Southern on earth"(Cobb, 1992) was a place of ultimate
terror for Black people even under slavery (the worst place to be sold
off too, the place of no return, the place of premature death). Black
and Native people alike were induced to raid and enslave Native tribes,
as a bargain for their own freedom or to defer their own enslavibility
by the British, French, and then American settlers. Abolition has its
incommensurabilities. The Delta is now more segregated than it was
during Jim Crow in 1950 (Aiken, 1990). The rising number of
impoverished, all black townships is the result of mechanization of
agriculture and a fundamental settler covenant that keeps black people
landless. When black labor is unlabored, the Black person underneath is
the excess. Angola Farm is perhaps the more notorious of the two State
Penitentiaries along the Mississippi River. Three hundred miles upriver
in the upper Delta region is Parchment Farm. Both State Penitentiaries
(Mississippi and Louisana, respectively), both former slave plantations,
both turned convict-leasing farms almost immediately after the Civil War
by genius land speculators-cum-prison wardens. After the Union victory
in the Civil War 'abolished' slavery, former Confederate Major, Samuel
Lawrence James, obtained the lease to the Louisiana State Penn in 1869,
and then bought Angola Farm in 1880 as land to put his chattel to work.
Cages on wheels. To mobilize labor on land by landless people whose

neo-slavery, precisely because it is legal. It is not simply a product
of exceptional racism in the U.S.; its racism is a direct function of
[the settler colonial mandate of land and people as
property.]{.underline} Black Codes made vagrancy - i.e. landlessness -
illegal in the Antebellum South, making the self-possessed yet
dispossessed Black body a crime (similar logic allowed for the seizure,
imprisonment and indenture of any Indian by any person in California
until 1937, based on the ideology that Indians are simultaneously
landless and land-like). Dennis Childs writes "[the slave ship and the
plantation]{.underline}" and not Bentham's panopticon as presented by
Foucault, "[operated as spatial, racial, and economic templates for
subsequent models of coerced labor and human warehousing - as America's

[Geopolitics and biopolitics are completely knotted together in a

traded prisons, Farms are not fundamentally capitalist ventures; at
their core, they are colonial contract institutions much like Spanish
Missions, Indian Boarding Schools, and ghetto school systems26. The
labor to cage black bodies is paid for by the state and then land is
granted, worked by convict labor, to generate additional profits for the
prison proprietors. However, [it is the management of excess presence on
the land, not the forced labor, that is the main object of slavery under

#### Both Military and Green use of land is killing Sámi culture.

The problem of subalternity was strongly present in early debates
regarding the promotion of 'green' energy projects in Sápmi. [Despite
the long tradition of [Sámi resistance to]{.mark} natural resource
extraction, [extractive projects that are]{.mark} advanced [in the name
of climate action place such resistance face to face with discourses
that,]{.mark} in the words of Saami Council's Per Olof Nutti, [are
"unreasonable" yet "difficult to stand against or criticise]{.mark}".
The notion of [green colonialism has efficiently addressed the dilemma,
creating space for the articulation of Sámi rights and experience, but
pressure from 'green' projects on Sámi lands continues to
grow.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, in line with the growing
geopolitical tensions and militarisation of public discourse, today such
projects are justified increasingly not just in reference to climate
action but also in terms of defence and security. Recent decisions of
the European Commission to promote and fast-track three new mining
projects in the Swedish part of Sápmi as "strategic projects" under the
Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) is a case in point. According to the
EC, these strategic projects -- whose approval the Saami Council
describes as "devastating betrayal of Indigenous rights and Sápmi's
future" -- are crucial for both the "success of the green and digital
transitions" and for the "resilience of the defence and aerospace
sectors" (Saami Council, 2025; European Commission, 2025). However, the
concept of subaltern security dilemmas is particularly useful in the
context of militarization, which is quickly becoming a new major
paradigm of land use and a discourse of regional development in Sápmi.
[As with the 'green transition', [military land use can pose a
significant threat to the practice of Sámi livelihoods,]{.mark} but
articulating Sámi rights to the land, or [demanding effective measures
to limit the harm done by military land use, is proving to be]{.mark}
particularly [difficult.]{.mark}]{.underline} On the one hand, such
concerns may be interpreted as unpatriotic or indifferent to the
exigencies of national security, and therefore result in a negative
stigma and hate speech. On the other hand, [[upholding such
rights]{.mark} can appear [difficult]{.mark} also [due to the ways in
which the discourses]{.mark} and practices [of national]{.mark} and
military [security appear to force individual subjects]{.mark} and
groups [to choose a side between their security as citizens of the
nation state and their own rights and security as Indigenous]{.mark} and
Sámi.]{.underline} Conversely, instead of positioning local and
Indigenous people's interests and concerns in a direct, clear-cut
juxtaposition vis-à-vis the geopolitical and security interests of the
state, the notion of subaltern security dilemma that I have suggested
here appreciates the ambiguity of the subaltern position while also
clearing space for the articulation of subaltern or counter-hegemonic
resistance and dissent. The position of subalternity does not expect
that Indigenous peoples would not share or recognise any of the national
or hegemonic security concerns of the state, as they also may well feel
that the need to secure the state from foreign invasion or advancing the
transition to renewable energy should be top priorities. However, when
such measures result in considerable insecurity in spheres of life that
are indispensable for their own future as Indigenous peoples, they are
disproportionately affected. Sensibility for subaltern security dilemmas
implies recognition of such ambiguities and uncertainties while building
ground for better policies and practices that can contribute to undoing
the discrepancy between national and Indigenous interests and security,
and safeguard the rights of Indigenous peoples, also in the context of
geopolitical tensions and change. In conclusion, [[both the green
transition and militarisation need to be understood as new regimes or
paradigms of land use which pose a significant threat to the viability
of Sámi livelihoods, and thereby, to Sámi rights and future at
large]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the context of the green transition, the
Sámi have already addressed, through conceptual innovation that centres
on green colonialism, the challenge of how to articulate resistance
against land-grabs justified in the name of climate action and saving
the environment. Today, [[new critical concepts are needed to also
address colonisation through militarisation]{.mark} and military land
use, [and to find ways to make Arctic geopolitics, security and defence
more accountable to the needs of the region's Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}. Subaltern security dilemma sensibility calls for
security with, not against, Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.

#### Mining for resources relating to green energy only ends up erasing native culture

Over recent decades, the Sámi people have become increasingly visible in
Nordic societies, especially in the arts and popular culture. While such
change could easily lead one to imagine this to be an era in which the
colonial structures and relations between Sámi and Nordic peoples and
states are finally being addressed and dismantled, the situation looks
rather different on the level of land and natural resources[. [Instead
of decolonisation, we are witnessing an era of intensive settler
colonial land appropriation, for perhaps never before has there been
such intensive pressure on Sámi lands as there is
today]{.mark}.]{.underline} Interestingly, much of the current pressure
comes from, and is justified in the name of, the green transition. The
green transition refers to systemic efforts to transition from fossils
to renewable energy as part of the battle against the climate change.
However, as the urgency of finding sustainable energy solutions grows,
it is becoming increasingly clear how the transition in its current form
is creating new problems and challenges that cannot be left unaddressed
if the transition is to be sustainable and just. As such, the green
transition is an example of "problem shifting" (van der Berg et al.,
2015) whereby efforts to find solutions to one set of problems create
new ones elsewhere. [In Sápmi, [one problem caused by the green
transition is the massive increase in mining needed to satisfy the
mineral needs of renewable energy]{.mark} and energy storage[. EU and
Nordic state strategies consider Sápmi and the Nordic High North as
mineral rich regions that are particularly suitable for mines]{.mark}
(e.g. Laframboise, 2022). [Mines may be welcomed]{.mark} by many locals
as possible sources of economic income and development, [but the
benefits are not distributed evenly, and mines]{.mark} always [pose
a]{.mark} significant [threat to the environment as well as to the
practice of traditional and Indigenous livelihoods.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Therefore, in Sápmi, even the prospect of a future mine tends to provoke
considerable Sámi insecurity and resistance (Lassila, 2018; see also
Knobblock, 2024). [The second problem is that renewable energy
production requires a lot of land and space.]{.underline} In Sápmi,
especially wind energy is now causing significant harm to reindeer
herding. Fjellheim (2023) details how, in the experience of Sámi
reindeer herders, overlapping land use or "coexistence" between large
networks of wind energy infrastructure and reindeer is not possible.
From the reindeer herders' perspective, wind energy amounts to a massive
land-grab that disturbs the entire system of sustainable pasture
rotation, endangering the viability and future of the entire livelihood
in the regions affected. [[Reindeer herding is foundational for Sámi
culture, yet under severe stress due to competing land use and a history
of dispossession by colonial settlers.]{.mark} Therefore, any
[disruption to the remaining pastures constitutes a threat that, from a
Sámi perspective,]{.mark} may be [**considered existential**, not only
to reindeer herding but for Sámi sense of security and peoplehood at
large.]{.mark} This is why projects associated with the green transition
today provoke considerable resistance across Sápmi.]{.underline} In
Norway, wind power built on Sámi lands has provoked large street
protests, and raising awareness of their negative impacts on Sámi
culture and livelihoods is also central for Sámi organisations and
institutions such as the Saami Council, Amnesty International's Sámi
branch, and the Sámi Parliaments in Norway, Sweden and Finland.
Articulation of such resistance has not always been easy nor
straightforward, however, these are projects that are justified in
public in reference to the urgent need to battle the climate change and
save the planet. As an Arctic Indigenous People, the Sámi have been at
the forefront of national and transnational environmental movements for
decades, and the warming climate already threatens the viability of
their traditional livelihoods and ways of life (Saami Council and
Samediggi, 2023). How could they possibly be opposed to projects that
are considered 'green'?

We have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border dispute with
Kuwait.---U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie to Saddam Hussein, July 25,
1990. Just over a week after the above conversation took place, Saddam
Hussein's forces invaded and occupied Kuwait. President George H.W. Bush
was apoplectic, stating that such a move would "not stand." Bush spent
several months building a 34-nation coalition to ensure that Iraq's
occupation would indeed be short-lived. On January 16, 1991, the
American-led coalition commenced bombing targets in Iraq and Kuwait
(Kinzer, 2006, pp. 287--288). Bush (1999) shares his account through
diary entries of this time, which provide evidence for his policy
choices. After first freezing Iraqi assets held in western banks, Bush
sends Dick Cheney to Saudi Arabia, where King Fahd "invites our troops
to come" (p. 477). In the same diary entry, Bush is clearly concerned
about how the situation will play in the realm of domestic politics, and
frets about the "tension in \[his\] stomach and neck." His own diary
entries provide support for an argument I have been making throughout
this project. To wit, it's not Orientalism that seems to account for
these [[policies of U.S. violence]{.mark},]{.underline} but rather a far
more banal assortment of factors, including domestic politics,
personality, and anti-Communist/terrorist ideology, each [[influencing
decisions to greater or lesser degrees depending on the
case]{.mark}]{.underline} at hand and the associated geopolitical
context. We can test this line of argument, or at least Orientalism's
influence, by again looking to the dominant discourse of the time. I
will run the LexisNexis searches precisely as I have done heretofore,
except that the search will be run for entries of Iraq and Kuwait with
the associated Orientalist triggers that one would expect to find if
this frame had been prevalent. The timeframe will encompass the
immediate lead-up to violence through the victory of coalition forces:
January 1, 1990 to February 28, 1990. The search for "untrustworthiness"
yielded zero results, as did the searches for "inferiority" and
"backwardness," as well as "irrationality," "submissiveness," and
"strangeness." Even the search for "threat" yielded only two results,
both of which evinced something other than Orientalism: ["[the common
danger like Iranian threats"]{.underline}]{.mark}[ and a book review
dealing with the "threat" that some U.S. policymakers conjured up
regarding the Iran-Iraq war of the late 1980s[. The search for
"Muslim" yielded two unique results]{.mark}]{.underline} (the third is
explained in the preceding sentence), neither of which was produced by
the editorial desk. One of the two was again dealing with Iran's role in
the region in a purely descriptive sense. The other, however, was more
interesting. It [[dealt with the states of Iraq and Kuwait and the
stigma of HIV/AIDS: "Tradition, culture and religion have contributed to
a timid and tardy recognition of the existence of the AIDS virus in much
of the Middle East . . ."]{.underline}]{.mark} This focus on the
"other's" culture may well have Orientalist overtones. Did the treatment
of HIV-positive patients in the U.S. during this time receive the same
sort of culture-centric framing? The questions and implications here are
potentially fascinating but belong in a different book.\\Using the same
search parameters, does the LexisNexis Congressional database provide
more evidence for Orientalists than the Times' dominant discourse? The
searches for "[[untrustworthiness," "inferiority," "backwardness,"
"irrationality," "submissiveness," "strangeness," and even "threat" and
"Muslim" show that these are simply not lexical choices used by senior
policymakers---at least in the evidence considered here, which is fairly
broad, though by no means all-inclusive]{.mark}.]{.underline}In the case
of Iraq/Kuwait and Operation Desert Storm, we again see virtually no
discursive evidence to support Orientalism as a useful approach for
understanding U.S. foreign policies of violence. If the cases of Grenada
and Panama failed to surprise due to geography, no such excuse exists
here. In short, Orientalism has suffered another blow to its analytic
significance---on empirical grounds of its own choosing.

### 2AC \-\-- NATO K

#### NATO is a representation of colonial violence and promotes the "white ideology"

Djibo **Sobukwe 22**,2/23/22, a former Central Committee member of the

Considering the public media attention and concern about possible
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it is worth
reminding people about NATO's bloody history in Africa. NATO was founded
in 1949 after WWII at a time when African countries were still under the
yoke of colonialism. In fact most of [[the]{.mark} original [founders of
NATO had been Africa's]{.mark} principal
[colonizers]{.mark}]{.underline} such as UK, France, Portugal, Belgium,
Italy and the USA as lead NATO organizer and dominant partner. The
organization was established as a collective defense against the Soviet
Union with the requirement (Article 5) that any attack on one was
considered an attack on all and therefore requiring a collective
response. Since NATO was founded with the purported purpose of halting
possible Soviet aggression and stopping the spread of Communism it would
seem to follow that after the collapse of the USSR in 1991 there would
no longer be a need for NATO. Since then however, NATO has expanded from
the founding twelve to at present thirty member states many of whom are
eastern European countries, formerly Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact
allies. Today, NATO has become a huge axel in the wheel of the military
industrial complex controlled by US empire for the purpose of full
spectrum dominance , driven by the ferocious appetites of corporate
capital. Colonial Africa as NATO Bases Walter Rodney accurately
describes the early foundation of colonial Africa's relationship with
NATO which continues today as he described in How Europe Underdeveloped
Africa: \"Needless to say, in the 1950's when most Africans were still
colonial subjects, they had absolutely no control over the utilization
of their soil for militaristic ends. [Virtually [the whole of]{.mark}
North [Africa was turned into a sphere of operations]{.mark} [for
NATO]{.mark}, with bases aimed at the Soviet Union. There could have
easily developed a nuclear war without African peoples having any
knowledge of the matter. [The colonial powers]{.mark} actually [held
military conferences in Africa]{.mark}n cities like Dakar and Nairobi in
the early 1950's, [inviting the whites of South Africa and Rhodesia and
the]{.mark} government of the [USA]{.mark}. Time and time again, [the
evidence points to this]{.mark} cynical [use of Africa to buttress
capitalism]{.mark} economically and militarily, and [therefore]{.mark}
in effect [forcing Africa to contribute to its own
exploitation]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[emphasis added\] \[1\] Kwame
Nkrumah had already warned in his 1967 Challenge of the Congo that there
were at least seventeen air bases, nine foreign naval bases, three
rocket sites and an atomic testing range operated by NATO in in North
Africa, in addition to military missions in about a dozen other African
countries, not to mention the exploitation of raw materials for the
production of nuclear weapons occurring in the mines of Congo, Angola,
South Africa and Rhodesia.\[2\] Nkrumah called for the urgent need to
counter the challenge of NATO in the strategy he outlined in his
Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare which included the call for a military
high command and an All African People's Revolutionary Army
(AAPRA).\[3\] The example of Portugal, as one of the original members of
NATO is worth exploring. [The great freedom fighter of Africa, Amilcar
Cabral, called Portugal "a rotten appendage of imperialism]{.underline}"
he said, "Portugal is the most underdeveloped country in Western
Europe[. [Portugal would never be able to launch three colonial wars in
Africa without the help of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the weapons of
NATO, the planes of NATO the bombs]{.underline}- it would be impossible
for them." \[4\] Cabral goes on to explain that [the only reason
Portugal was able to hold on to its colonies in Africa is because it had
been a semi-colony of Britain]{.underline} since 1775 and Britain
defended Portugal's interest during the partition of Africa. Furthermore
[[NATO, a creation of the US, uses Portug]{.mark}a[l]{.mark} and its
colonies [as part of the larger objective of domination of
Africa]{.mark} and the world.\[5\] Portugal conducted a vicious war
against its colonies in Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, and
Mozambique much like the US did in Vietnam. In both cases, [colonizing
powers used the most modern weapons]{.mark} including napalm and cluster
bombing campaigns [killing thousands]{.mark}, against guerilla armies
that refused to bow down]{.underline}. The Portuguese dictator Marcelo
Caetano was forced to give up economic interests in Angola to some of
the NATO powers in exchange for the NATO armaments and supplies
used.\[6\] Yet, Portugal still lost the war against the heroic
anti-colonial forces.

[Reviewing [perspective]{.mark}s [on '**resource wars'**]{.mark} is a
**precarious exercise**. The term itself [is]{.mark} conceptually
'**[reductionist']{.mark}**, especially so when arguments exclusively
relate **conflicts** to **resources** and take a]{.underline} narrow
**[understanding]{.underline}** of resources focused on their exchange
or use value and their physical location. Conflicting perspectives have
also pitted theoretical and methodological approaches against each
other. [Early studies [selecting resources as '**proxy'
variables**]{.mark} for social **processes** have been **criticised**
for their ([de)politicis]{.mark}ing [effects]{.mark}, particularly [when
**emphasising**]{.mark} the immediate **financial** aspects of resource
'**looting'** at the expense of other dimensions. '**Resource war'
[narratives]{.mark}** have also been [characterised by]{.mark} a high
degree of **[essentialism]{.mark}**, [especially]{.mark} with regard to
[the **decontextualisation**]{.mark} and finger pointing [of
'**greed-driven thugs**]{.mark} [looting resources']{.mark} frequently
[reported in]{.mark} the **[public media]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a
result, broader contexts, scales and interconnections have often been
overlooked. As Dalby (2002) urges, research on resource-related
conflicts should be self-reflective and clearly question whose
'security' interests are actually served by the perspective and
methodologies adopted. [Although academic [research]{.mark} often
[**lagged** behind **advocacy**]{.mark}-oriented [research]{.mark},
[academic perspectives]{.mark} on '**resource wars'** [continue to
bear]{.mark} a **responsibility** [on policy]{.mark} processes and the
**interpretation** of **conflicts**.]{.underline} Engagement between
different perspectives has contributed to novel approaches to the
significance of resources for conflict risk, duration and resolution.
[[Mainstream **geopolitical perspectives**]{.mark} have **clearly**
[put]{.mark} a [priority on]{.mark} the **[resource]{.mark}** supply
[security of **wealthy nations**]{.mark}, to the point of [calling
for]{.mark} **military [invasions]{.mark}** [abroad]{.mark} or
**resource autarky** at home.]{.underline} There is little doubt that
resource supply is a major concern of 'realpolitiks', but geopolitical
narratives have often been blinded by seductive (and sometimes dubious)
supply and demand statistics, articulated by an [[**oversimplified**
geographic **understanding** of **power relations**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
representations of [potential '**flash points'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Critical geopolitical perspectives have rightly denounced such
narratives, pointing to the vested interests involved and built-in
prejudices and [calling for greater **contextual sensitivity** and
nuance towards power relations among firms, **communities** and
**authorities**.]{.underline} [[Studies]{.mark} from **political economy
perspectives** have strived for **precision** in the study of
**mechanisms-[linking]{.mark}** [**resources** and
**conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} and for methodological rigueur within
a mostly quantitative template, allowing for some more detailed
comparative case studies. The methodological approach taken by these
studies has often [[**limited** the scope of]{.mark} their historical
**[engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the form of violence studied
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the possible variables that could factor for
the processes hypothesised. These studies [[have yielded]{.mark} major
insights]{.underline} into the significance of [**resource dependence**
for conflict risks, and [patterns of]{.mark} conflicts relating to
**particular types** of [resource]{.mark}s and mode of
**[exploitation]{.mark}** and **regulation**.]{.underline} Political
ecology perspectives have emphasised contextualisation and multiscalar
relations, pointing also to the specific material and social dimensions
of resources. Most political studies have continued a fruitful tradition
of fine-grained and historically grounded analysis of largely individual
case studies with a focus on nuanced analyses of power relations.
Significant findings have been gained on the importance of the
historical, institutional and material context of 'resource wars'.
Certain resources have been found to increase vulnerability to certain
types of conflict or to prolong conflicts. Bridging and renewing
conceptual and methodological approaches drawn from these three
perspective could yield yet further insights on so-called 'resource
wars' and serve broad objectives of social and environmental justice.

### 1AR \-\-- Resource Wars K

#### There is no [singular]{.underline} solution or cause to resource wars other than [imperial exploitation]{.underline} that asserts capitalist agendas of control.

The first issue relates to the political economy and governance of
resource-dependent countries, many of which face a similar pattern of
growth collapse, corruption, and delegitimated state authority[. Given
the [importance of]{.mark} natural [resources in the economy]{.mark} or
the economic potential of most developing countries, the issue of
[translat]{.mark}ing resource [**exploitation** into]{.mark} political
**[stability]{.mark}** and **economic development** will remain
**central** in the years to come, often [for **entire
regions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The second issue relates to the scale
and [number of **[economic]{.mark}**, **environmental** or
socio-cultural [conflicts related to **resource exploitation**]{.mark}
that increasingly [oppose **local populations**]{.mark}, **business**
**interests**, the **state**, [and global]{.mark} **environmental** and
human [rights **networks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 27 While most conflicts
are either peacefully negotiated or limited to social protest movements
and small-scale skirmishes, in other cases customs of violence and a
radicalisation of ideologies turned them into full-scale civil wars.
Organised opposition to processes of globalisation unaccountable to
local interests and growing demand for raw materials should only
increase such adversarial politics and the need for more effective
dialogue. The third, and often related strategic issue is that natural
resource revenues have become the economic mainstay of most wars in the
post Cold War context. Accessible and [[internationally **marketable
resources**]{.mark} such as **diamonds** and **timber**, not to mention
**drugs**, have [played]{.mark} a [**significant** role in
**conflicts**]{.mark} in at least twenty countries during
the]{.underline} 1990s. This is not to argue that those wars are only
[[financed]{.mark} or motivated [by]{.mark} the [control of
resources]{.mark},]{.underline} but that resources figure prominently
[[in]{.mark} their **[agendas]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} at least
economically. Given the concentration of wars in poor countries with few
foreign-earning sources, resources are likely to remain the economic
focus of most belligerents in years to come. Even if 'conflict
resources' come under greater regulatory pressure, there is a likelihood
that criminal networks and unscrupulous businesses will pursue trading,
especially those already involved in arms trafficking. [[There is **no
simple**]{.mark} and **comprehensive** [measure]{.mark} [that can
**reduce**]{.mark} the [prevalence of **conflicts**]{.mark} in
**resource-dependent**]{.underline} countries, but several factors can
assist in this regard. The specificities of resources and licit
character of their trade demand a new type of engagement and set of
regulations on the part of businesses and policy makers to tackle their
contribution to war economies. The Security Council, governments,
business associations, and advocacy NGOs have been developing an array
of rules, investigation, sanctions, and implementation measures targeted
at specific commodities over the past few years, and these initiatives
need support and encouragement. 28 [Most noticeably, diamonds have been
the targets of **unprecedented** regulatory measures that, however, in
the absence of sustained monitoring efforts will most probably remain
**plagued** by difficulties **inherent** to the **physical** and
**market specificities** of this commodit]{.underline}y. In other cases,
[[vested]{.mark} commercial and **[geopolitical
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as by the potential
humanitarian impact on the targeted '[conflict resource' [have continued
to **refrain**]{.mark} the [use of **sanctions**]{.mark},]{.underline}
with a mixed effect.

#### Resource deficits are [naturally equalizing]{.underline}, only intervention from external nations breeds conflict.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED: NONE OMITTED\>\>

This article analyzed a dynamic environment in which a resource-rich
country trades an exhaustible resource with a resource-poor country. In
every period, the resource-poor country can arm and attack the
resource-rich country. When the resource is extracted by price-taking
firms, there is a novel externality as each firm fails to internalize
the impact of its extraction on military action by the resource-poor
country[. [In the]{.mark} **empirically [relevant]{.mark}** [case
where]{.mark} the [demand for]{.mark} the [**resource** is
inelastic]{.mark} and the resource-poor country can capture most of the
remaining endowment in a war, [war becomes **inevitable**]{.mark}.
Because the [anticipation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} future [war
**encourages**]{.mark} more **[rapid extraction]{.mark}**, in the case
of nonbinding **extraction limits**]{.underline}, equilibrium war
happens in the initial period. Externalities across price-taking firms
can be internalized by the government of the resource-rich country
regulating the price and the level of production of the resource. [This
"monopolistic" environment can **prevent wars** even when they occur
under **competitive markets**]{.underline}. The resource-rich country
does so by making offers that leave the resource-poor country
indifferent between war and peace at each date. Interestingly, this
involves a deviation from the Hotelling rule because, depending on
whether incentives for war are increasing or decreasing in the remaining
endowment of the resource, the resource-rich country prefers to at adopt
as lower or more rapid rate of extraction of the resource than that
implied by the Hotelling rule. In particular, in the empirically
relevant case where the demand elasticity for the resource is less than
1, extraction is slower and resource prices increase more slowly than
under the Hotelling rule because this enables the resource-rich country
to slow down the rise in armaments, for which it is paying indirectly.
Conversely, when demand is elastic, [[the]{.underline} [resource-rich
country]{.underline}]{.mark} [can [reduce armament costs by
adopting]{.mark} a more [rapid]{.mark} path of resource
[extraction]{.mark} than the one implied by the Hotelling
rule.]{.underline} Nevertheless, a naive conjecture that regulation of
prices and quantities by the resource-rich country will necessarily
prevent war and make its citizens necessarily better off is also
incorrect. [[The **monopolistic** environment, which allows]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} such **[regulation]{.mark}** and in fact [gives]{.mark} the
resource[-rich country]{.mark} the [ability to make
**take-it-or-leave-it** offers,]{.mark} leads to a different type of
**distortion**: because the resource-rich country cannot commit to
making **attractive offers** to the **resource-poor country** without
the latter arming, the **equilibrium** path involves **armaments** at
each date]{.underline}. The resource-rich country must then, implicitly,
pay the future costs of armaments to prevent war. [This might,
[paradoxically, make war]{.mark} [**more likely** than the **competitive
equilibrium**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally, we also showed that the
main insights generalize to the case where there are several countries
competing for resources and where the resource-rich country can also
invest in armaments for defense.

#### The negative's framing of the 'Russian threat' emerges from [xenophobic]{.underline}, [Western]{.underline} ideology. 

**Gutorov et al. 23** \[Vladimir Gutorov, St. Petersburg State

7/24/25

The [connection between [Russophobia]{.mark} and
[ideology]{.mark}]{.underline} was very well shown by O.B.Nemensky:
"Russophobia is an ideology [[of Western]{.mark} [origin]{.mark},
[asserting]{.mark} the [evil]{.mark} [nature]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[Russian]{.mark} [people]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is endowed [with
some unique properties that determine its craving for everything
vile]{.underline}. Russians seem [[incapable]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
everything that constitutes [human]{.mark} [dignity]{.mark} among other
peoples,]{.underline} and this is [[explained]{.mark}
[genetically]{.mark}]{.underline} and culturally and historically. [The
logic of Russophobia is [based]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
[opposition]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}n and European as bad and
good]{.underline}. In connection with these properties, [Russians as a
people are [seen]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [fundamentally]{.mark}
[hostile]{.mark} to the West]{.underline}, and [Russia as an essentially
different, [alien]{.mark} [civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}. It appears
to be an [existential enemy of the West and everything that is perceived
in Western culture as specifically 'Western']{.underline} --- [freedom,
democracy, human rights]{.underline}, etc. From this,
[[conclusions]{.mark} are [drawn]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the [need to
fight Russia and]{.mark} destroy everything that constitutes
Russianness]{.underline} --- [physical or cultural]{.underline},
depending on specific interpretations" \[Nemensky, 2014, p.3\].

In turn, R.V.Mikhailov draws attention to the fact that
[Russophobia]{.underline} is not just a special [[case of]{.mark}
[xenophobia]{.mark}]{.underline}, "it is a complex, [[complex]{.mark},
multilevel ideological [system]{.mark} [aimed]{.mark} [at]{.mark}
[discrediting]{.mark} the fundamental foundations of what is commonly
called the '[Russian]{.mark} [World']{.mark} in modern political
practice]{.underline}... [against]{.underline} the value foundations of
our [identity]{.underline}" \[Mikhailov, 2015a, p.74; Mikhailov, 2015b,
p.98--107\].

Indeed, [Russophobia was formed as a big ideological myth]{.underline}
\[Shirinyants, 2019, p.115--130\], [[based]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [idea
of a non-Christian]{.mark}, [barbaric]{.mark}, [Asian]{.mark},
[despotic]{.mark} [country]{.mark}]{.underline}, whose kings are
unpredictable in their actions and therefore incompetent tyrants, and
[the [people]{.mark} are slavishly **[subjugated]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
[power]{.mark}, **[stupid]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **pathologically
[cruel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And this Asian empire seeks to conquer
enlightened Europe, claims world domination: "whenever," notes
Kara-Murza, ["[when]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} was [involved]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} a European or world [war]{.mark}, even if defensive,
domestic, [Western]{.mark} [elite]{.mark} was [seized]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} a [paranoid]{.mark} [fear]{.mark} that the result would be
a Russian invasion that would engulf Europe]{.underline}" \[Kara-Murza,
2015, p.13\]. He is echoed by Leonid Lux, who notes the fear of the
"invincible" Russian Empire surpassing the West \[Lux, 1993,
p.176--177\].

P.L.Karabushchenko drew attention to another important aspect of the
existence of Russophobia in the history of politics and thought. Not
quite correctly \[Karabuschenko, 2021, p.7, 4\] defining Russophobia as
"a kind of chimera (collection of fears) formed by the sum of phobias
that arises on the basis of cultural and political perception of Russia
as an enemy" \[Karabuschenko, 2021, p.3\], saying that
[Russophobia]{.underline} is "a kind of pseudo-ideological chimera that
permanently [arises from national enemies and geopolitical rivals of
Russia as the main ideological means in the general [mechanism]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [containing]{.mark} the [imaginary
'Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} [[threat']{.underline},]{.mark}
summarizing the descriptions of signs of Russophobia existing in the
literature and agreeing with the main theses of the authors who have
studied Russophobia as an anti-Russian pro-ject (the irrational nature
of Russophobia, fear of the Russian threat, slander against Russia and
the Russian people, distortion of history, etc.), Karabushchenko asks
the question "Is there a fundamental difference between Russophobia and
the anti-Russian campaign?" Answering the question posed, he correctly
emphasizes the semantic difference between these concepts that are close
in meaning and meaning: "if Russophobia is often emotional, eclectic,
irrational psychopathic in nature, then the anti-Russian campaign
(politics) is systemic, rational, clearly defined goal and the choice of
means for solving the set task" \[Karabuschenko, 2021, p.3\].

OUTBURSTS OF RUSSOPHOBIA, RUSSOPHOBIC TECHNIQUES AND THEIR POLITICAL
ESSENCE

Pointing to the irrational nature of Russophobia, Martin Malia finds
significant fluctuations in the perception of Russia as the "antithesis"
of European civilization and identifies two periods in the 19th ---
early 20th centuries: 1815--1855 ("Russia as an Eastern despotism") and
1855--1914 ("Return to Europe") \[Malia, 1999, p.7, 157, 168\]. In our
opinion, there were significantly more periods or outbursts of
Russophobia, and the history of European politics and thought of the
19th --- early 20th centuries was not limited to the rejection of Russia
as an "eastern despotism" or recognition of its "returning to Europe".
[The [periods]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Russophobic]{.mark} [hysteria]{.mark}
usually [coincided]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [strengthening]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} [weakening]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n
state]{.underline} and did not occur in different countries at the same
time, which was determined both by political and geographical factors
and historical circumstances, primarily by the nature of international
relations these countries and Russia. Mettan, in particular, wrote about
this, considering the content of Russophobia. He correctly noted that
"hatred of Russia is a mixed feeling". This [hatred [appears]{.mark} in
[passive]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [active]{.mark} forms. The passive is
expressed in the desire to profit from the sudden weakness of Russia,
the active comes to life when Russia gains strength.]{.underline}

By analogy with other types of xenophobia, [Russophobia]{.underline} is
[characterized by]{.underline} the same techniques. This is emphasizing
the difference, [[asserting]{.mark} [Western]{.mark}
[superiority]{.mark} and using stereotypes]{.underline} to make
judgments \[Mettan, 2016, p.18, 20\]. Modern authors addressing the
topic of Russophobia highlight the [characteristic features]{.underline}
of this phenomenon, among which, for example, fals[ification of data,
the [reporting]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [ridiculous info]{.mark}rmation about
Russia and Russians, the use of various kinds of fakes.]{.underline}
Russophobic writers usually replicate "clichéd ideas about Russia" (an
expression by L.Lux), using all sorts of means to describe the infernal
evil of the "Muscovites", their Asian atrocities, pathological cruelty,
etc., etc., they [use "[technologies]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[psychological]{.mark} [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}" (an expression by
S.G.Kara-Murza). In general, [the essence of Russophobia boils down to a
certain set of anti-Russian cliches, negative stereotypes, which, in
fact, constitute Russophobia]{.underline}. And the use of all the
techniques of manipulation by the reader --- forgery, falsification of
documents, hoaxes, half-truths, etc., generates the effect of the
illusion of truth --- [[repeated]{.mark} [lies]{.mark} [become]{.mark}
[true]{.mark}]{.underline}. Apparently, this is largely due to the long
life of Russophobia in the history and politics of foreign countries.

Introduction This article draws on Rene Girard's general account of
sacrificial violence to elucidate the race-thinking and related
affective formations that imbue the terrorism-related policies and
social practices of contemporary Western security states. My discussion
unfolds **[[Girard's]{.underline}]{.mark}** figure and **[[analysis of
the "scapegoat mechanism" within]{.underline}]{.mark}** and against the
**[[discriminatory and persecutorial practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that **[[are fueled by talk]{.mark} of terror and religious
fundamentalism and [that generate]{.mark} and target [Arabic Muslims as
outsiders]{.mark}]{.underline}** now as a matter of course. [**It
relates the profiling and targeting of African Americans in the United
States [through]{.mark} their extra-[legal]{.mark} and legal
[lynching]{.mark} to that [of]{.mark} Arabic and [Muslim
Americans]{.mark} under immigration and refugee policy. With attention
to [the creation of]{.mark} social assemblages** or [group identities,
such as]{.mark} that of "[we the people"---of the]{.mark} city, state,
the [nation]{.mark}]{.underline}---it [[considers]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[how]{.underline}]{.mark} [the growing preoccupation with [security
has]{.mark} worked to [consolidate communities against]{.mark}
culturally, politically, and religiously marked [others]{.mark} that are
**presumed to be threatening to them,**]{.underline} and in recent
"security" discourse, **[particularly against certain [mythic formations
of "Islamic fundamentalists]{.mark}.]{.underline}**" One of my aims is
to **[[highlight]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[within [contemporary
scapegoating practices how]{.mark} an affective [politics of
fear]{.mark} works to [produce]{.mark} cultural and religious difference
as racial difference, and specifically as [racial
hierarchy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In doing so, this article emphasizes
points of productive convergence and critical departure between Girard's
work on sacrificial violence and contemporary critical analyses of the
changing formations of racism and race-thinking. To throw into relief
the work of scapegoat racism within contemporary political discourse, I
bring Charles Mills' (1997) account of the Racial Contract that
underwrites the public policies of Western liberal states to bear on an
examination of the (Girardian-informed) **[[sacrificial impulses]{.mark}
of retributive "justice]{.underline}**" that [**have** [increasingly
informed]{.mark} domestic and international [obsessions with
"security]{.mark}."]{.underline} The scapegoat mechanism For Girard
(1979) and others who have expanded on his theory of the scapegoat
mechanism, [[human societies are]{.mark} demonstratively
["sacrificial**"**]{.mark} **in nature: [to quell their impulses of
violence]{.mark} [and]{.mark} to manage conflicts and dissension,
communities [select "surrogate victims" ]{.mark}**[onto whom are]{.mark}
mimetically [projected the causes of violence]{.mark} **or chaos that
would otherwise exacerbate social disorder and strife [and lead
to]{.mark} the "interminable, infinitely repetitive process" of
vengeance**]{.underline} (pp. 13--14). Girard (1979) describes the
scapegoat mechanism, as it operates in contemporary and historical
societies, in terms of what he calls "a theory of **[[sacrificial
substitution]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (p. 5). [Considered to be a
universal feature of social groups, traceable through the centuries in
fictive and factual narratives, the execution or expulsion of an often
randomly selected scapegoat---even under the circumstances where he or
she is vilified**---**[serves to deflect]{.mark} or absorb potential
cycles of [violence]{.mark} and vengeance [and]{.mark} to [restore
order]{.mark} to communities, particularly in times of social or
economic crisis, widespread insecurity, or **panic**]{.underline}. This
sacrificial impulse may be said to be expressed, however unwittingly, by
Lord Denning in his notorious comment in the case of the Guilford Four:
that **[[even if innocent people were convicted]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for the terrorist attacks in question, "**[[the]{.mark} whole [community
would be satisfied]{.mark}"]{.underline}** in doing so (cited in Walker,
1999: 49), as if this satisfaction, alone, somehow justified the
perceived injustice of it all, and as if retribution against anyone
randomly associated with the politics behind the act in question was
itself the function of justice. And indeed the price paid for providing
this satisfaction is not lost on those who have been subjected to
so-called "miscarriages of justice" on its account, as we hear, for
example, from one of the Birmingham Six, Peter Hill, who spent over 16
years in prison after being "framed" for the 1974 Birmingham pub
bombings: shortly after their convictions were reversed by the Appeal
Court at London's Old Bailey, Hill announced that "British justice is in
tatters today" because "we were made scapegoats to please the public"
(Phillips, 1991: 52). At the time, the security discourse was
particularly invested in distinguishing Irish Republican Army (IRA)
terrorists from the vulnerable and unsuspecting British innocents,
**[[the repeated framing]{.mark} of which [was central to the
solidification of a fear-infused]{.mark} protectionist [political
machinery built on]{.mark} the allure of paternalistic [promises of
security.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The response to the bombings included
the immediate passage of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary
Provisions) Act (1973), the predecessor of the more permanent Terrorism
Act introduced in 2000, and the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2005,
although the terrorist stereotypes that inspired them had clearly
shifted and expanded over this time. Similar stories---with different
characters---can be told of the "international community," particularly
in the panic of the immediate wake of 9/11, when member states of the
United Nations (UN) were essentially mandated by the Security Council to
ratify existing international anti-terrorism measures---and
specifically, the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism (1999)---and to implement their own domestic laws on the
issue. On 28 September 2001, after a meeting that famously lasted only
3minutes, and for which there is no record, the UN Security Council
passed the "WideRanging Anti-Terrorism Resolution" (1373)1 and created
the Committee to Monitor Implementation.2 The resolution called for
"international cooperation" to suppress and combat terrorism, while
turning its attention and suspicion toward refugees and all forms of
international trafficking; it tightened controls over the issuance of
identity papers and travel documents and implemented measures to
scrutinize asylum seekers for any ties to terrorism, especially when
their claim is based on "political motivation[." A sacrificial logic has
been repeatedly expressed to the point of being rather commonplace in
the hype of the so-called "war on terror" and its endless reverberations
in the security-focused policies of the past decade]{.underline}, and in
the rising tides of Islamophobic sentiment that have swept through
communities and launched organizations such as Jihad Watch,3 mandated to
expose and eradicate the imposition of "jihad theology and ideology" in
"Western societies." In the United States, it has inspired initiatives
such as the "Save our State" legislation passed with overwhelmingly
popular vote by the Oklahoma State legislature in 2010, prohibiting
courts from considering Islamic Shari'a law when deciding a case
(Ballou, 2012).4 Being against Islam, as such, or refusing any
legislative or institutional recognition is the only condition of
membership in such catastrophizing communities, physically, virtually,
and otherwise. Such environments feature scapegoating as a daily affair,
expressed in what Girard might consider to be its "ancient" sense:
operating at the imposed borders and margins of the community, quite
literally as a "casting out" (Razack, 2008) of those who are deemed
"non-citizens" for whatever reason. Expelled, if not consigned to "the
camp" (Razack, 2008: 7), [**[the mythic figure carries]{.mark} with it
the [fears and anxieties of communities]{.mark} caught up in cycles of
vengeance [and]{.mark} in the [desire to define]{.mark} itself
[against]{.mark} those [others]{.mark}** on the right side of a
vindictive justice. As Sherene Razack (2008) observes, when critical
political theorists speak of significance of "the camp" in an endless
war on terror, "it is in order to note the sheer numbers of people
exiled from political community, their status as non-persons, and the
fact that their eviction from political community is a legally
authorized one]{.underline}" (p. 12). [Since 9/11 in particular,
domestic and international [imperialist politics have]{.mark} firmly
[fastened onto fear]{.mark} as an apparatus [of social]{.mark} and
public [control, using]{.mark} the specter of [terrorism as a pro**xy**
]{.mark}for public danger and social insecurity]{.underline}. [**The
threat of [terrorism]{.mark}--- imagined or otherwise---[has been
ascribed]{.mark} stereotypical cultural, political and religious
[attributes]{.mark},** which for this generation, at least, is that of
[the presumptively Middle Eastern "Islamic fundamentalist]{.mark}**,"**
the popular making of which has furnished **[a (re)newed
archetype]{.mark} and related symbol to carry the fears and anxieties of
countless communities within security states such as**]{.underline}
Canada, the **[United States]{.underline}**, the United Kingdom and
Australia. [**[Such figures make regular appearances in]{.mark} the
contexts of [media,]{.mark} public education, marketing initiatives, and
political campaigns, invariably [to]{.mark} their own [benefit]{.mark}
and to that of burgeoning "**[security industries"]{.mark} and private
military contactors, worldwide]{.underline}. [Through these apparatuses,
[the scapegoating mechanism is fully imbricated in the productive racial
formations that have constituted the "Muslim-looking" subject as an
identity]{.mark} in its own right]{.underline} (Cashin, 2010; Volpp,
2002), **[part of w]{.underline}**hich includes its status as an
"archetypal enemy" (Razack, 2008: 12), readily resorting to terror, and
publicly justifiably profiled, preventatively detained or
deported[.]{.mark} Although this refocused racism has notably different
expressions than those used to justify the slavery of African detainees
two centuries ago, it nonetheless shares with these earlier formations
its related incentives: they are **[both lucratively [yoked to the
global economies of modern imperialism]{.mark}, and they remain a
condition of empire's international corporate/militaristic
flourishing]{.underline}**. Sherene Razack (2008) discusses at length
how the new juridical formation of what Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt
call **[today's Empire5 formulates the haunting figure of the terrorist
as the "new enemy]{.underline}**" (p. 12). [[Fueled by]{.mark} the
passions of "[just wars]{.mark}" and [enabled b]{.mark}y the
"[exceptionalism" that unilaterally extends]{.mark} executive and
[police power]{.mark}s[,]{.mark} as they do security measures around
border control, [the "logic of the exception"]{.mark} sustains **a
racial order** through legislated practices of exclusion, disposal, and
consignment to "the camp]{.underline}" (Agamben, 2005: 2; Razack, 2008:
12--13). As Razack suggests, in line with Hardt and Negri (2000:
13--16), **[this logic gives content to racial difference[,
marki]{.mark}ng [those who are expendable]{.mark}, deportable, and
justifiably detainable as a function of a neoliberal ordering that, at a
"banal" level[, empowers police to act against enemy everywhere,]{.mark}
while at another empowers the nation against "an archetypal enemy who
poses an absolute threat," [justifying]{.mark} permanent states of
emergency and [endless war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While "color" has
faded as a measure of the "fundamental difference" that becomes
particularly socially and politically meaningful between "us" and
"them," it remains a key part of the popular discourse that articulates
the distinction between these poles of social existence as race. This is
accomplished, in part, through the popular rendering of terms such as
the "American Taliban," John Walker Lindh, as a "white traitor," or of
the "white Taliban" for Americans found living in Afghanistan wearing
the local dress associated with them (Zahori, 2013). The very invocation
of color marks a race distinction through the suggestion that Western
citizens were engaged in a form of what Martha Ertman has elsewhere
described as "race treason" (Ertman, 2010). Consider David Hicks, the
"white," "Aussie Taliban," throughout international media, who was
imprisoned, interrogated, tortured, and detained without charge for 5.5
years at Guantanamo Bay, after being picked up at a training camp in
Afghanistan shortly after 9/11. In a response to critics of his recent
book about the whole ordeal, and bewildered by relentless efforts to
demonize him for not coming clean about his presumed Islamic
fundamentalist connections, he remarks, were it not for my rendition, my
illegal imprisonment, the years of detention without a fair trial and
the fact that I was used as a political scapegoat, no one would have
ever heard my name. There would be no book, and you would not be reading
this now. I would have ended up back in the northern suburbs of
Adelaide, with a 9-5 job, just one of many unknown faces in a crowd.

[[Scholars have collected]{.underline}]{.mark} abundant [[evidence of
the impact of terrorist attacks on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[emotions
of individuals.]{.underline}]{.mark} Studies of the [psychological
aftermath of the 9/11]{.underline} attacks in New York and Washington
[showed that anxiety, fear, and depression rose after these traumatic
events]{.underline} (Huddy et al., 2005; Skitka, Bauman, and Mullen,
2004). Similar evidence was found in other national contexts, such as
after multiple suicide bombings perpetuated in Israel (Bar-Tal and
Sharvit, 2004), the 2004 bombing in Madrid (Miguel-Tobal et al., 2006),
the 2005 strikes in London (Rubin et al., 2005), the 2015 Charlie Hebdo
(Ben-Ezra, Leshem, and Goodwin, 2015; Vasilopoulos, Marcus, and
Foucault, 2018), and Bataclan attacks in Paris (Castanho-Silva, 2018).
These [[studies suggest that emotional reactions to traumatic events can
trigger a set of attitudes]{.mark} and behaviors, [such as]{.mark}
authoritarianism]{.underline} (Jost et al., 2007), [antiterrorism policy
preferences]{.underline} (Huddy et al., 2005), changes in voting
intentions (Montalvo, 2010; Tena-Sànchez, 2017), [and [anti-immigrant
feelings]{.mark}]{.underline} (Esses, Dovidio, and Hodson, 2002;
Legewie, 2013; Ferrín et al., 2020). These latter are of special
relevance to the European context, as immigrants are the most obvious
target for individuals' anger. [[According to the psych]{.mark}ological
[lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline}, [[people who find themselves in a
stressful]{.mark} and anxious [situation tend to simplify the
causes]{.mark} and dynamics [of the traumatic events causing their
anxiety]{.mark}, [relying on coping mechanisms]{.mark} that provide
simple and straightforward answers. In a context of stress, [people
might rely on stereotyping]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wilder, 1993;
Bodenhausen, 1993) [to [generalize the source of threat to]{.mark}
everyone resembling the perpetrator of the particular event they
experienced, as, in the case of Islamic terrorism, to [immigrants as a
whole.]{.mark}]{.underline} Previous literature shows that terrorist
attacks have a negative impact on individual attitudes to immigrants
(Bar-Tal and Labin, 2001; Boomgaarden and de Vreese, 2007; Canetti-Nisim
et al., 2009; Echebarria-Echabe and Fernàndez-Guede, 2006; Skitka,

Considering these findings, we might expect to see that Britons became
more negative toward the outgroup after the Manchester bombing than they
were before. Individuals, however, do experience the emotions derived
from the terrorist attacks from different initial predispositions toward
immigrants. While some are more positively oriented to immigrants, some
others tend to have more negative views ( Hainmueller and Hiscox, 2010;
Rustenbach, 2010; Wilkes, Guppy, and Farris, 2008). High educated
individuals and left-wing individuals tend to be the most favorable
toward immigrants (Haubert and Fussell, 2006; Duru, Hanquinet, and
Cesur, 2017). With a few exceptions ( Jungkunz, Helbling, and Schwemmer,
2018), the majority of studies on terrorist events have found that the
impact of the terrorist attack is stronger among those who tend to be
more positive about immigrants (Nail et al., 2009; Brouard,
Vasilopoulos, and Foucault, 2018; Ferrín et al., 2020). Citizens who are
more liberal/positively predisposed toward immigrants are less
predisposed to manage threats and fear, and, consequently, tend to
display higher levels of authoritarianism after a terrorist attack
(Hetherington and Suhay, 2011; Nail et al., 2009; Sharvit et al., 2010;
Van de Vyver et al., 2016). Liberal citizens, the argument goes, are
less cognitively prepared to react to a terrorist attack (the
liberal-reactive hypothesis, Nail et al., 2009) as it leads to
disconfirming their initial stereotypes. The terrorist attack is
therefore a comparatively stronger source of stress and uncertainty for
them than it is for conservative/authoritarian people, since the former
are not prepared to deal with such uncertainty compared to the latter.
Thus, for liberal people, a terrorist event is more likely to shake
previous stereotypes and thus to affect the degree to which immigrants
are positively perceived. Even if cosmopolitanism (as a search for
diversity; Hannerz, 1990) is generally linked to positive attitudes to
immigrants (Haubert and Fussell, 2006; Paredes, 2017), also in the
United Kingdom (Duru, Hanquinet, and Cesur, 2017), all studies on
terrorism and attitudes to immigrants have focused so far on ideology
and education. It is however likely that people with strong cosmopolitan
ideals will be affected by a terrorist event---since they are unprepared
to deal with it---than people with weak cosmopolitan ideals. The first
hypothesis will thus read as follows.

### 1AR \-\-- Terrorism Reps \-\-- Otherization

**Terrorist representations protect the white Christian male and
otherize Muslims.**

**Corbin 17** \[Caroline Mala Corbin, 2017, Fordham Law Review,
Terrorists Are Always Muslim but Never White: At the Critical Race
Theory and Propaganda,
https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5437&context=flr\]cheolang

[While unconscious discrimination helps explain the "terrorists are
Muslim" narrative, [white privilege]{.mark} helps [explain]{.mark} the
"white people aren't terrorists" one. Discrimination and privilege are
two sides of the same coin, that coin being [a racialized
hierarchy]{.mark}.]{.underline} What is white privilege? Peggy McIntosh
defines it as "an invisible package of unearned assets that I can count
on cashing in each day, but about which I was 'meant' to remain
oblivious."71 White privilege is essentially various benefits that white
people enjoy, usually without even realizing it, that people of color do
not. Examples run the gamut. As a white person, I can buy "nude"
stockings that match my skin72 or go to the movies and see lots of
people whose race is the same as mine.73 As a white person, I can wander
in an upscale boutique or board an airplane without raising any
suspicion.74 Additionally, "\[w\]hen I am told about our national
heritage or about 'civilization,' I am shown that people of my color
made it what it is."75 Today, I want to add to that list: [[Even if I
use violence within the United States to intimidate a civilian
population, odds are I will not be called a terrorist]{.mark}.76 [Rather
than]{.mark} immediately becoming [a demonized "other,"]{.mark} [I would
remain]{.mark} an [individual,]{.mark} albeit a deeply troubled one. The
[dehumanization of the Muslim perpetrator happens in an instant.]{.mark}
The [white]{.mark} Christian [perpetrator]{.mark}, on the other hand,
[always retains his humanity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even after committing
heinous acts of violence, we see these white Christians depicted as
human beings, not terrorist "others."77 [[The media]{.mark} describes
their childhood and [shows us their graduation photos, not their mug
shots]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} They are shy, quiet young men78 or
charming Southern gentlemen.79 At school, they sang in the choir or
played varsity sports.80 They have favorite songs and favorite movies.81
One reporter described the white Christian terrorist responsible for the
Charleston massacre as "an often-silent, awkward housemate who liked to
watch 'Oprah' during the day and loved sappy movies such as 'Titanic'
and 'Stand by Me.'"82 [These [white Christian killers have
families]{.mark}: much loved families,83 [all-American
families]{.mark},84 [grieving families]{.mark}.]{.underline}85 The
Charleston County magistrate noted that "\[w\]e have victims, nine of
them. But we also have victims on the other side . . . . There are
victims on this young man's side of the family."86 [Time and again,
a[ttention is paid to]{.mark} the individual [mental health of]{.mark}
these [white]{.mark} Christian [extremists]{.mark}.]{.underline}87 "With
non-Muslims, the media bends over backwards to identify some
psychological traits that may have pushed them over the edge. [[Whereas
if it's a Muslim, the assumption is they must have done it because of
their religion]{.mark}."88 As a white terrorist, the main assumption
made about my motive is that some personal trauma must have triggered my
violence. In contrast, like a stock villain in a movie, [the Muslim
perpetrator has no backstory, no grieving family, his motive is clear
enough]{.mark}.]{.underline} My argument is not that white terrorists
are never mentally ill; many are. But so too are many Muslim terrorists.
[However, the [presumption of white innocence means]{.mark} that for
white terrorists [we look to mental illness for explanations]{.mark} [in
a way that we do not for nonwhite terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
bottom line is that white Christian extremists remain individuals---
"lone wolves" suffering in some individualized way---as opposed to an
interchangeable member of a terrorist conspiracy. For example, one of
South Carolina's senators characterized the Charleston terrorist as just
"a whackedout kid."89 Indeed, he insisted that "\[t\]here are real
people who are organized out there to kill people in religion and based
on race; this guy's just whacked out."90 Because these attacks are
categorized as one-offs,91 other white Christian men are spared the
profiling that brown Muslim men are subjected to. Moderate white
Christians are also spared the expectation of having to condemn every
act of violence by extremist white Christians.92 Some might argue that
unlike Muslim terrorists, white terrorists are not motivated by an
ideology or trying to intimidate a civilian population. But they would
be wrong. Like their Ku Klux Klan forefathers, white Christian
terrorists often subscribe to an ideology of white supremacy and act to
instill terror in communities of color.

of generous sharing that there was in both storytelling and knowledge --
it was phenomenal."\]Participants spent mornings in a classroom, running
models and looking at satellite and radar data. Afternoons were spent
out on the actual ice, observing its features and learning to use
instruments to measure it.It\'s important work, especially because sea
ice in the Arctic was at a record low this winter, according to research

thermal buffer, sea ice limits how much heat and moisture the Earth
loses, said Erin Emily Thomas, who works as a sea ice modeler at Los

Thomas said. \"Maybe in the near future, there will be very little sea
ice to go out on. And so I think [**[it\'s really important to study

is, and how imperfect the modern models are at simulating it.\"The sea
ice is way more complex than what we\'re able to capture,\" she said.
\"It just gives me the motivation to keep improving our models.\"Nome
hunter Terry Komonaseak said that during the event, he shared his
stories about traveling -- and even falling though -- the sea ice. He
also talked about how he\'s seen ice conditions change over the years --
something he noted on a hunting trip a year before last.\"I couldn\'t
believe how different that ice is compared to other years,\" he said.
\"It\'s so strange to see how it actually looks so small, like it
shrunk, like it\'s non-existent.\"One of the organizers was Savik
Richard Glenn, an Iñupiaq hunter, geologist and a former executive at
the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. He said the workshop\'s hands-on
activities included checking ice thickness, watching for changes and
looking at the way snow and ice interact.\\\"Every day we witnessed
change,\" Glenn said. \"The little pieces of evidence that give you an
idea about safety, about how prone the the ice might be to movement,
either breaking off and floating away --- or ridging up and and
grounding itself into the sea floor and potentially changing or covering
up the tracks of your trail, if it\'s a major storm event.\"Glenn said
that participants asked local whaling captains for permission to use
their whaling trails, and they helped improve them.\"We tried to behave
as if we were neighbors with the folks who depend on the ice for
subsistence,\" he said.Komonaseak, the hunter from Nome, said he enjoyed
meeting scientists and locals during the workshop and is planning to
keep in touch with some of them.\"We are hoping that we will eventually
get back together on the same subject and probably in the same place,\"
he said.

In the Arctic, [[sea ice is a way of life]{.mark}---from the [animals
that depend on it for breeding, shelter, and food]{.mark}, to the
[people]{.mark} who [rely on hunting for their
livelihoods]{.mark}.]{.underline} How the ice forms in the fall, how
thick it is, the location of openings in sea ice, and how it retreats in
the spring determine where the animals are and whether it is safe for
hunting. [[Communities]{.mark} living near sea ice [depend on it for
their cultural identity and subsistence practices]{.mark}, but its
impacts stretch far beyond.]{.underline} [Even though [sea ice]{.mark}
occurs primarily in the polar regions, it [influences our global
climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arctic sea ice acts like the planet's air
conditioner.]{.underline} Its bright, white surface reflects sunlight
back into space. In other words, sea ice does not absorb much solar
energy, keeping temperatures relatively cool in the Arctic. However, [as
more sea ice retreats throughout the year, the darker open oceans absorb
more solar energy, raising temperatures and setting off a cycle of
warming and further melting.]{.underline} Even a small increase in
temperature can lead to greater warming over time, making the polar
regions the most sensitive areas to climate change on Earth. The Arctic,
for instance, is warming at two to three times the rate of the rest of
the planet. At the other pole, the Antarctic Peninsula is not far behind
in terms of rate of warming. Sea ice helps regulate exchanges of heat,
moisture, and salinity in the polar oceans. It insulates the relatively
warm ocean water from the cold polar atmosphere except where cracks, or
leads, in the ice allow exchange of heat and water vapor from ocean to
atmosphere in winter. The number of leads determines where and how much
heat and water are lost to the atmosphere, which may affect local cloud
cover and precipitation. As sea ice extent shrinks and breaks up,
exposed ocean waters increase. With more moisture forming in the
atmosphere, and with higher air temperatures, the question arises: will
more rain-on-snow events occur in the Arctic? On land, rain on snow can
have catastrophic consequences on livestock unable to penetrate
newly-formed thick ice to access food. Sea ice can influence ocean
currents. When sea ice forms, most of the salt is pushed into the ocean
water below the ice. Some salt, however, may linger in small pockets
between ice crystals. Water below newly-formed sea ice has a higher
concentration of salt, making it more dense than surrounding ocean
water. This salty, dense water sinks, flowing along the ocean bottom
toward the equator. Meanwhile, warm water from mid-depth to the surface
travels from the equator toward the poles. [In this way, [sea ice
contributes to the ocean\'s global conveyor-belt circulation]{.mark}.
Changes in the amount of sea ice can disrupt ocean circulation, thereby
[leading to changes in global climate]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"By altering animal behavior and removing physical barriers, **[[loss of
sea ice may create]{.mark} new pathways for animal movement and
[introduction of infectious disease]{.mark} into the
Arctic]{.underline}**," says a paper published by researchers, including
Tracey Goldstein, an associate director of the One Health Institute at
the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. She and her colleagues
published the study in the journal Scientific Reports. It explores how
[melting sea ice may be facilitating the spread of a disease called
Phocine distemper virus (PDV) among marine mammals. PDV, a highly
infectious virus, can afflict marine mammals with respiratory and
neurological problems, and also make affected animals more susceptible
to secondary infections]{.underline}. In 1988, an outbreak of PDV killed
over 23,000 European harbor seals, and a 2002 epidemic killed over
30,000. In 2004, scientists found [the same disease was affecting otters
in Alaska, and they've indicated they believe melting sea ice may be to
blame.]{.underline} Previously, North Atlantic and North Pacific
populations of otters were not known to interact -- experts believed sea
ice prevented them from reaching one another, and they are not known to
travel far. But they now are [suggesting melting ice could have created
a pathway for the animals to make contact and spread the disease,
perhaps with other species acting as intermediaries.]{.underline} Ice
melt + COVID-19 ... 'perfect storm' To examine the topic, the
researchers analyzed samples from 2,530 live and 165 dead animals in the
North Pacific Ocean collected between 2001 and 2016. The study included
samples from northern sea otters, northern fur seals, Steller sea lions,
and a variety of ice-associated seals. They found evidence PDV was
widespread in the North Pacific Ocean -- both in terms of infection and
exposure -- beginning in 2003. "[Openings in the [sea ice]{.mark} along
the Russian coast were [linked to the increased likelihood of PDV
exposure or infection]{.mark},"]{.underline} the researchers wrote. "And
[peaks of viral exposure in 2003 and 2009 occurred after a year with low
sea ice extent and open water along the Russian coast, suggesting that
multiple introductions may have occurred."]{.underline} "This is the
first example in the Arctic, and I think that with the sea ice it's
really making us think a little bit more about it," Goldstein said. "As
animals are changing their behavior because the ice is changing, they're
moving further, maybe looking for food or other things." The researchers
have been planning to explore the topic further, but the COVID-19
pandemic is interfering with 2020 fieldwork plans. They had expected to
collect data this year after record low Arctic sea ice in 2019, but many
projects are now being canceled or postponed. "It's kind of the perfect
storm," Goldstein said. "This is one of the years we really need to
understand what's happening up in the Arctic and, of course, this
outbreak is changing all of our lives." [More contaminants crossings
more national borders Diminished [sea ice]{.mark} may also allow
contaminants to [travel between nations via ice, potentially with
serious geopolitical consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Ice can
transport a wide variety of contaminants ranging from anthropogenic
pollutants like oil, lead, mercury, and microplastics, to dust,
sediments, aerosol deposits, algae, and even biological
communities]{.underline}. [Sea ice]{.underline} historically could last
10 years, persisting through summers and building layers over time. Now,
the ice is thinner, it moves faster, and in many places it completely
melts during the summer, releasing any contaminants in it wherever it
ends up. As the Arctic melts, increased shipping and oil drilling in the
region are expected to boost the risk of contamination. Researchers
including Patricia DeRepentigny, a PhD candidate at the University of
Colorado in Boulder, examined how a melting Arctic may lead to an
international exchange of pollutants. They published their findings in
AGU's Earth's Future. Using the Sea Ice Tracking Utility, which
DeRepentigny helped develop, they found that by mid-century the time it
takes ice to travel between regions will decrease by around half, and
the exchange of ice between nations will "more than triple." [The
scenario with the least likelihood of spreading contaminants between
nations was actually the most dire scenario: [the end-of-century highest
emissions scenario]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under this scenario, the [ice
would melt so quickly after forming]{.underline} that [it wouldn't have
a chance to transit between nations and would melt close to where it was
formed, likely releasing any contaminants back into the country of
origin's waters.]{.underline}

[[Tracking sea ice is 'early warning system' for]{.mark} global
heating]{.underline} -- but the US is halting data sharing News comes as
research finds record lows of Antarctic sea ice had seen more icebergs
splintering off ice shelves Graham Readfearn Environment and climate
correspondent Tue 1 Jul 2025 11.00 EDT Share Scientists analysing the
cascading impacts of record low levels of Antarctic sea ice fear a loss
of critical US government satellite data will make it harder to track
the rapid changes taking place at both poles. Researchers around the
globe were told last week the US Department of Defence will stop
processing and providing the data, used in studies on the state of
Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, at the end of this month. [Tracking the
state of sea ice is crucial for scientists to [understand how global
heating is affecting the planet]{.mark}. Sea]{.underline} ice reflects
the sun's energy back out to space but, as long-term losses have been
recorded, more of the planet's ocean is exposed to the sun's energy,
causing more heating. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, based at
the University of Colorado, maintains a Sea Ice Index used around the
world to track in near real-time the extent of sea ice around the globe.
In two updates in the past week, the centre said the US government's
Department of Defence, which owns the satellites that contain onboard
instruments used to track sea ice, would stop "processing and
delivering" the data on 31 July. Climate scientists have been warning
that Trump administration cuts have targeted climate functions across
government, and there has been fears the sea ice data could be targeted.
The news comes as new research, some of which relied on the data, found
that [record low amounts of sea ice around Antarctica in recent years
had seen more icebergs splintering off the continent's ice shelves in a
process scientists warned could push up global sea levels faster than
current modelling has predicted]{.underline}. Dr Alex Fraser, a
co-author of the research at the Australian Antarctic Program
Partnership (AAPP), said NSIDC's sea ice data was "our number one heart
rate monitor" for the state of the planet's ice. "[[It's our early
warning system and tells us if the patient is about to flatline]{.mark}.
[We need this data]{.mark} and now \[the scientific community\] will be
forced to put together a record from a different
instrument.]{.underline} We won't have that continued context that we
have had previously." NSIDC has said it is working with alternative and
higher-resolution instruments from a different satellite, but has warned
that data may not be directly comparable with the current instruments.
Fraser said: "We are seeing records now year on year in Antarctica, so
from that perspective this could not have come at a worse time." Dr Walt
Meier, a senior scientist at NSIDC, said there were other "passive
microwave instruments" that could keep the long-term record going, but
he said differences with older sensors created a "a challenge to make
the long-term record consistent and there will some degradation in the
consistency of the long-term record." "I think we will end up with a
robust and quality record that users can have confidence in," Meier
said, but said this would add to uncertainty to estimates of trends.
Asked why the government was stopping the data, he said because
"everything is old and resources are limited, my guess is that it is not
worth the time and effort to upgrade the systems for such old sensors,
which may fail at any time." The research, published in the journal PNAS
Nexus, found a link between increasing numbers of icebergs calving from
floating ice shelves and the loss of sea ice. While the loss of sea ice
does not directly raise sea levels, the research said it exposed [[more
ice shelves to wave action, causing them to break apart and release
icebergs faster]{.underline}]{.mark}. Glaciologist Dr Sue Cook, also
from AAPP, said ["like a cork in a bottle" those shelves help to slow
down the advance of land-based ice that does raise sea levels if it
breaks off into the ocean.]{.underline} She said the higher rates of
iceberg calving seen in Antarctica were not accounted for in
calculations of how quickly the ice sheet might break apart and
contribute global sea levels. "If we shift to this state where summer
sea ice is very low but [we continue using models based on previous
periods, then we will definitely underestimate how quickly Antarctica
will contribute to sea level rise,"]{.underline} she said.

from the increased intensity of tropical cyclones (hurricanes or
typhoons), such as Tropical Cyclone Winston (which, packing the
strongest winds ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, tore through
the center of the Fiji archipelago in February 2016), to the
decades-long sea-level rise (which, at rates three to four times the
global average in some western Pacific Island groups, has led to the
disappearance of entire islands).3, 4 [[The imperative of
responding]{.mark} appropriately]{.underline} to accelerating climate
change [[is]{.mark} itself [growing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many coastal
communities in the Pacific Islands (and elsewhere) have grappled to come
to terms with the effects of increasing land loss, lowland flooding, and
groundwater salinization attributable to accelerating sea-level rise.
[[Many responses have been]{.mark} naive, short sighted, and even

at all is unjust: Our main position is that if you are a Sámi, you
should be able to consider the whole Sámi territory as a home despite
crossing borders. We are used to cross\[ing\] the border all the time
and to maneuver\[ing\] around it. Complicating matters, he explains, is
the fact that internal Sámi borders bisect the borders of the state
system. While the Norwegian-Swedish border runs from south to north, "we
have our internal borders, with our languages, culture, and
reindeer-herding livelihoods crossing the borders, and they go from east
to west." As in so many other places around the world, [state
borders]{.underline} here [fail to take into account the lives of people

BC

Despite its common characterization as a remote, harsh and homogenous
landscape, the Arctic is a multifaceted and varied region where a
plethora of actors and complex issues, including, inter alia,
historical, social, cultural, geopolitical, economic and environmental
dimensions intersect at different levels. [[Prior
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the start of Russia's full-scale war in
[[Ukraine]{.mark} in February 2022, [the Arctic Council was considered
to have achieved relative success]{.mark} in maintaining cooperative
relations in the region]{.underline}, despite high tensions in recent
history, including in relation to Russian actions in Ukraine (notably,
during the annexation of Crimea in 2014). This is probably [[due to
the]{.mark} deliberate [decision to "exclude military security
issues]{.mark}" leading to increased interactions among
state]{.underline} and non-state actors, s[uch as "Arctic Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline} as they gained more political visibility and an
official voice."11) In this vein, with the aim of coordinating and
cooperating on environmental protection and development issues among
Arctic states, the Declaration on the Establishment of the Arctic
Council (1996) -- the Ottawa Declaration, provides for the participation
of non-state actors in the Arctic Council, including Indigenous Peoples'
organizations. **[[The erosion of relationships with the Russian
Federation within the Arctic Council]{.mark} [following]{.mark} the
start of the conflict in [Ukraine]{.mark} in a context of global climate
and ecological crises po[ses additional challenges to the already
vulnerable Arctic and its (Indigenous)
inhabitants]{.mark}]{.underline}**, given the prominent role of the
Russian Federation in the region in many respects. [As the largest
Arctic state]{.underline} in terms of area, coastline and population,
including Indigenous population, [the role of the [Russian
Federation]{.mark} in the Arctic -- and the Arctic Council -- [is
crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[The fracture of relationships]{.mark}
between the Russian Federation and the other members of the Arctic
Council [poses several questions on the ability]{.mark} of the latter
[to operate "business as usual" without its largest
member]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, [[it is uncertain how
critical legally-binding]{.mark} [agreements]{.mark}, such as the
Agreement on Search and Rescue in the Arctic (2011), the Agreement on
Marine Oil Pollution in the Arctic (2013), and the Agreement on
Enhancing Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017) [could materially operate
without Russian participation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scope of the
Agreement on Search and Rescue in the Arctic, for example, would have
limited significance and effectiveness if the state with the largest
Arctic coastline is not involved in its implementation. Similarly, the
protection of the Arctic ocean and cooperation under the Agreement on
Marine Oil Pollution in the Arctic would be seriously impaired without
the participation of the Russian Federation, especially, considering the
numerous precedents of major oil spills and related contamination in the
Arctic.12) Therefore, th[e [climate of uncertainty in the applicability
of these agreements]{.mark} and the future of partnerships within
[and]{.mark} outside [the Arctic Council]{.mark} in connection with the
fractured relations with Russia therein [add onto the continuous
vulnerability in the Arctic, which is adversely affected by
climate]{.mark} change impacts [as well as]{.mark} **the constant threat
of [(neo)colonial incursions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although [the full
implications of the ongoing war on Ukraine are yet to unfold in the
Arctic]{.underline} and beyond, [[it is]{.mark}]{.underline} already
possible -- and [[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[to reflect on the
trajectories that]{.mark} have [led to the current
situation]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic [and]{.underline} ask
questions touching upon [the foundations of relations in the
region]{.underline}. Independent of geopolitical turbulence, [it is
important to reconsider long-lasting assumptions underpinning state-led
relations in the Arctic]{.underline} to meaningfully address current
interrelated challenges, like those posed by the climate and ecological
crises. Accordingly, [to understand traditionally prevailing colonial
approaches to the Arctic by all kinds of state and private actors, it is
crucial to rethink]{.underline} enrooted [assumptions on nature
underpinning past and current human relationships]{.underline} with the
natural world, inextricably linked, inter alia, to notions of land,
authority and resources, which guided colonial and post-colonial
relationships in the Arctic and elsewhere. These assumptions on nature
are fundamental axes to the ongoing climate and ecological crises, which
correlate to and exacerbate current geopolitical tensions that add
burden to already vulnerable ecosystems and peoples, like those in the
Arctic. In this vein, [[one could]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[ask
what]{.mark} the primary [assumptions]{.mark} on land that underpinned
the construction of authority over the Arctic and its
peoples]{.underline} and natural resources were; and, how these
prevailing assumptions on land, authority and resources have shaped
current imaginaries on the Arctic [and, consequently, [guided its
governance so far]{.mark}]{.underline}?

PP=permanent participate

**[There are [practical challenges that the PPs face in the AC]{.mark}
which [minimize the impact they can have in the decision-making
process]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The [[PPs do not have the same material
capacities]{.mark} as the member states to maintain a high presence in
AC activities]{.underline}. They operate small delegations with
part-time employees, whilst the member states have better staffed
bureaucracies(Chater 2019, 150). This is important to explore because
**[[PPs do not have the right to vote]{.mark} in the AC and [their
effectiveness on policies is thus based on their
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sidorova 2019, 78). It is therefore
vital for the PPs to be represented at every level in the AC just like
the member states if they are to participate and be consulted in full in
the decision-making process as the Ottawa Declaration suggests (Ottawa
Declaration, 1996). One could also argue that because one of the AC's
goals is to give people of the Arctic a voice, the PPs are one of the
few actors in the AC that actually do inhabit the Arctic. Most Arctic
state diplomats who work for the AC are based in southern locations
(Landriault et al. 2020, 66) and the same goes for observers. It
therefore undermines the legitimacy of the AC if PPs are
underrepresented in its activities. The lack of representation that PPs
face in the AC can be explored through researches done by Sebastian
Knecht (2017) and Andrew Chater (2019) which show how [the [PPs are not
as well represented as member states]{.mark} in AC meetings, [and
sponsor fewer projects]{.mark} than the member states. This ultimately
creates challenges for the PPs because [they cannot participate and
fully consult on issues if they cannot attend AC
activities.]{.mark}]{.underline} Knecht looked at the attendance of
stakeholders in the AC, which are the eight member states, six PPs, 32
observers and the EU who serves as an 'observer in principle', during
the period from 1998-2015. The dataset used attendance in meetings as a
proxy for participation and gave stakeholders a binary value: 1 for
'attended' and 0 for 'not attended'. At least one representative on
behalf of the stakeholder needed to attend in order for the stakeholder
being given the value 1 ('attended'). If attendance of a stakeholder
could not be verified, they were not given a value. The dataset resulted
in 5722 observations made from the 47 stakeholders during the
above-mentioned time period. Most observations were on subsidiary body
levels or approximately 75 per cent. Working groups were documented 3790
times and Task Forces 517. SAO meetings were documented 1138 times and
Ministerial meetings 277 times (Knecht 2017, 208-209). The findings from
the research show that [participation in the Ministerial meetings is the
highest amongst all stakeholders]{.underline}. As Table 2 shows,
[participation of the member states remains high at all levels whilst it
drops dramatically for both the PPs and observers at Working Group and
Task Force level. [The participation of PPs in]{.mark} [AC]{.mark}
meetings [drops]{.mark} from roughly [97 per cent]{.mark} for
Ministerial [and]{.mark} SAO meetings [down to around 34-42 per cent
for]{.mark} [Working Groups and Task Forces]{.mark} whilst for member
states it drops from 100 per cent to around 94 per cent]{.underline}
(Knecht 2017, 210). This is a major challenge because the Working Groups
have been described as the backbone of the AC (Rottem 2016, 2). **[[The
representation of PPs]{.mark} [is]{.mark} thus [crucial in order to
develop adaptive governance]{.mark} mechanisms [that are in the best
interest for Arctic people]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Knecht 2017,
219-220). This is [because the PPs are one of the few actors that do
inhabit the Arctic]{.underline} (Landriault et al. 2020, 66) and
according to the Ottawa Declaration one of AC's focus are Arctic
inhabitants (Ottawa Declaration, 1996). Knecht's (2017) findings show
that even though the member states and the PPs should sit at the same
table **[[the PPs are underrepresented in the AC]{.mark} towards the
member states]{.underline}** (Knecht 2017, 219-220). **[Because of the
underrepresentation one could argue that t[he member states have a
greater opportunity to voice their opinion and are therefore the leading
actors in the AC, making it a state-centric
forum]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The [AC]{.mark} is
[expanding]{.mark}]{.underline} regarding areas [[where it can get
involved]{.underline}]{.mark} due to globalization and climate change
(Nord 2016, 67). [This expansion [makes it increasingly hard for the PPs
to represent themselves]{.mark} with their current
capacities]{.underline} as has been demonstrated with Knecht's research
(2017). [The Indigenous Peoples Secretariat]{.underline}, a support
secretariat for all the PPs (Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples'
Secretariat, n.d.), [released a dataset that]{.underline} [shows how
extensive the work for the AC is]{.underline}. Approximately two dozen
meetings are held every year excluding SAO and Ministerial meetings as
well as other outside events. [It is obvious that the [member states
are]{.mark} way [better equipped than the PPs]{.mark} to keep up with
this workload]{.underline} (Exner-Pirot 2015) [and that [PPs
have]{.mark} significantly [fewer resources to]{.mark} develop
capabilities to [operate in international diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Burke 2019, 3). The member [states, for example, have various experts
and bureaucrats to send, whilst most PPs are being represented by one or
two people for all of the events]{.underline} (Exner-Pirot 2015). In an
interview focusing on PPs perspective on the AC, Jim Gamble, a former
executive director of the AIA, explained that [because of the expansion
of the AC the [PPs were having a]{.mark} [difficult time keeping up with
the workload]{.mark} as well as finding experienced people to
participate in the various projects that the AC works on at any given
time]{.underline} (University of Washington, 2015). In the interview
Chief Michael Stickman, International Vice Chair at the ACC, also
pointed out that most of the representatives of the PPs volunteer their
time to attend the various meetings that the AC holds (Ibid) which
arguably makes it difficult for the PPs to man all AC activities.
Together **[[these issues]{.mark} clearly [demonstrate why the PPs are
not participating]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the level they wish to
**[[and that can result in decisions being made without them]{.mark} if
they are unable to attend meetings]{.underline}**

## AT: Alaska CP

### Solvency Deficit \-\-- Alaska Bad

#### CP fails -- the state actively works against indigenous tribes -- they're more worried about jurisdictional turf than helping indigenous peoples

**Fletcher 21** Matthew L. M. Fletcher, a member of the Grand Traverse
Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, is Foundation Professor of Law at

Law and Policy Center. "Indian Tribes Are Governing Well. It's the
States That Are Failing"

\<\<tmsgk!

Consider Alaska. Nearly a decade ago[, the [Indian Law]{.mark} and Order
Commission, a bipartisan group convened by Congress to study crime in
Indian country, [concluded that]{.mark} the [state of Alaska's]{.mark}
centralized [control over law]{.mark} enforcement throughout the state
[was a **direct cause**]{.mark} **[of]{.mark} rising rates of [violent
crime against Indian women]{.mark}** [and children]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Nothing much has changed]{.underline} since that report. There are
[[229]{.mark} federally recognized Indian [tribes in Alaska]{.mark}.
Many of them are attempting to develop justice systems, but they [have
never had the support of the state]{.mark}]{.underline}. The commission
reported that [the [state opposed tribal authority]{.mark} because it
might create jurisdictional complexities.]{.underline} (See this
analysis by Samuel Gottstein, now an Alaska lawyer.) It's as if [Alaska
[state officials]{.mark} were [more concerned with]{.mark}
[protecting]{.mark} amorphous [jurisdictional turf]{.mark} than with
remedying ineffective law enforcement]{.underline}. In 2021, Alaska's
police seem more interested in avoiding COVID-19 vaccinations than
fighting crime. Despite the state's foot dragging, [Alaska tribal
governments are prioritizing public safety]{.underline} and child
welfare. Until recent years, there were few tribal courts in the state.
Now they are springing up all over and leading Alaska in creative rural
justice. The tribes are starting from nothing, and it will take years
and maybe decades to see significant progress[. But what those tribes
are doing is the epitome of modern-day tribal sovereignty]{.underline}.
Tribes are asserting governmental power to help people; too many states
are hiding behind it to avoid accountability. Oklahoma and Alaska are
just two examples. [Indian tribes are routinely stepping in]{.underline}
to assert tribal sovereignty [wherever we see the mission-critical
failure of state governments throughout the country.]{.underline}

For example, tribal historic preservation offices (THPO) may guide
access to cultural resources ([Ciocco et al.,

Engagement of tribal governments including tribal natural resource
management programs does not, however, de-facto constitute incorporating
IK expertise as such institutions may or may not reflect and/or
represent traditional tribal cultural systems ([Ciocco et al.,

details), their recognition as valid evidence for inclusion in federal
policy, research, and decision-making requires adherence to specific
standards regarding the quality and transparency of data sources, as
well as the preservation of tribal intellectual property ([Brush,

For this reason,
[[incorporation[1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#fn0001) of
IK can be approached as a sub-component of broader engagement with a

1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#fig1)).
While tribal engagement alone in a project does not constitute IK
incorporation, intentionally designed and comprehensive engagement can
pave the way for IK incorporation ([Steen-Adams et al.,
2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#ref106)).

[[This engagement can take multiple forms,
including inform]{.underline}]{.mark} (notifying collaborators of
research results), [[consult]{.underline}]{.mark} (indirect engagement

Here, consult engagement should not be confused with tribal
consultation---the formal government to government process ([Blumm and
Pennock,

[[Projects with the goal of IK incorporation]{.mark}]{.underline} may
[[need to engage with multiple entities]{.underline}]{.mark} or
organizations [[within a tribe]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[rather
than]{.mark}]{.underline} solely engaging with [[an individual
entity]{.underline}]{.mark} within a tribe (for example, just the tribal
department of natural resources or the tribal historic preservation
officer).

Importantly, [[multiple modes of engagement can be applied within a
single project]{.underline}]{.mark} to engage with the multiple entities
within a tribe, as was done for the UMU-CP ([Figure
1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1393354/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com#fig1)).
The overall process was led by biophysical and adaptation scientists and
the UMU climate change coordinator (lead engagement). Engagement between
these team members began a year before the formal start of the project
and included a site visit and many conversations about how to support
UMU climate adaptation efforts. Once the formal project began, this
project team obtained consent to implement the project from the UMU
Tribal Council and coordinated with the UMU THPO in the collection and
preservation of IK (inform engagement). IK was elicited from UMU
IK-holders via interviews and was then incorporated into the CAP process
by managers and researchers (consult engagement; see section 2 for
details). UMU resource managers were involved in various stages of the
project, but their participation in the scenario planning process, which
entailed the translation of climate information into insights for
adaptation (empower engagement), was especially important. Deliberately
identifying a project's modes of engagement with various partners is
important for scientific transparency and setting expectations.
Flexibility in project aims and timeline were also critical to
responding to evolving constraints (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) and partner
needs and capacity.

### NATO Bad 

#### NATO is a representation of colonial violence and promotes the "white ideology"

AK

Considering the public media attention and concern about possible
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it is worth
reminding people about NATO's bloody history in Africa. NATO was founded
in 1949 after WWII at a time when African countries were still under the
yoke of colonialism. In fact most of [[the]{.mark} original [founders of
NATO had been Africa's]{.mark} principal
[colonizers]{.mark}]{.underline} such as UK, France, Portugal, Belgium,
Italy and the USA as lead NATO organizer and dominant partner. The
organization was established as a collective defense against the Soviet
Union with the requirement (Article 5) that any attack on one was
considered an attack on all and therefore requiring a collective
response. Since NATO was founded with the purported purpose of halting
possible Soviet aggression and stopping the spread of Communism it would
seem to follow that after the collapse of the USSR in 1991 there would
no longer be a need for NATO. Since then however, NATO has expanded from
the founding twelve to at present thirty member states many of whom are
eastern European countries, formerly Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact
allies. Today, NATO has become a huge axel in the wheel of the military
industrial complex controlled by US empire for the purpose of full
spectrum dominance , driven by the ferocious appetites of corporate
capital. Colonial Africa as NATO Bases Walter Rodney accurately
describes the early foundation of colonial Africa's relationship with
NATO which continues today as he described in How Europe Underdeveloped
Africa: \"Needless to say, in the 1950's when most Africans were still
colonial subjects, they had absolutely no control over the utilization
of their soil for militaristic ends. [Virtually [the whole of]{.mark}
North [Africa was turned into a sphere of operations]{.mark} [for
NATO]{.mark}, with bases aimed at the Soviet Union. There could have
easily developed a nuclear war without African peoples having any
knowledge of the matter. [The colonial powers]{.mark} actually [held
military conferences in Africa]{.mark}n cities like Dakar and Nairobi in
the early 1950's, [inviting the whites of South Africa and Rhodesia and
the]{.mark} government of the [USA]{.mark}. Time and time again, [the
evidence points to this]{.mark} cynical [use of Africa to buttress
capitalism]{.mark} economically and militarily, and [therefore]{.mark}
in effect [forcing Africa to contribute to its own
exploitation]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[emphasis added\] \[1\] Kwame
Nkrumah had already warned in his 1967 Challenge of the Congo that there
were at least seventeen air bases, nine foreign naval bases, three
rocket sites and an atomic testing range operated by NATO in in North
Africa, in addition to military missions in about a dozen other African
countries, not to mention the exploitation of raw materials for the
production of nuclear weapons occurring in the mines of Congo, Angola,
South Africa and Rhodesia.\[2\] Nkrumah called for the urgent need to
counter the challenge of NATO in the strategy he outlined in his
Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare which included the call for a military
high command and an All African People's Revolutionary Army
(AAPRA).\[3\] The example of Portugal, as one of the original members of
NATO is worth exploring. [The great freedom fighter of Africa, Amilcar
Cabral, called Portugal "a rotten appendage of imperialism]{.underline}"
he said, "Portugal is the most underdeveloped country in Western
Europe[. [Portugal would never be able to launch three colonial wars in
Africa without the help of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the weapons of
NATO, the planes of NATO the bombs]{.underline}- it would be impossible
for them." \[4\] Cabral goes on to explain that [the only reason
Portugal was able to hold on to its colonies in Africa is because it had
been a semi-colony of Britain]{.underline} since 1775 and Britain
defended Portugal's interest during the partition of Africa. Furthermore
[[NATO, a creation of the US, uses Portug]{.mark}a[l]{.mark} and its
colonies [as part of the larger objective of domination of
Africa]{.mark} and the world.\[5\] Portugal conducted a vicious war
against its colonies in Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, and
Mozambique much like the US did in Vietnam. In both cases, [colonizing
powers used the most modern weapons]{.mark} including napalm and cluster
bombing campaigns [killing thousands]{.mark}, against guerilla armies
that refused to bow down]{.underline}. The Portuguese dictator Marcelo
Caetano was forced to give up economic interests in Angola to some of
the NATO powers in exchange for the NATO armaments and supplies
used.\[6\] Yet, Portugal still lost the war against the heroic
anti-colonial forces.

[As]{.mark} the impacts of climate change increasingly and
disproportionately affect indigenous peoples, equitable approaches to
regional climate change adaptation must center the voices, needs, and
priorities of Indigenous communities. Although the tribal climate change
principles identify actionable recommendations to address the unique
needs of Indigenous peoples in the contexts of climate change adaptation
efforts undertaken at the Federal level in the United States (U.S.),
there has yet to be exploration of how such principles might be applied
at the regional level. [[Through semi-structured qualitative interviews
with 18 representatives from inter-Tribal organizations and non-Tribal
organizations engaged in regional climate adaptation in the U.S. Pacific
Northwest, this research sought to describe challenges faced by, and
opportunities available to, non-Tribal entities when engaging with
Tribes on regional climate adaptation initiatives.]{.underline} All
respondents reported high levels of motivation to work with Tribes on
climate adaptation and identified several perceived benefits of
integrating Tribal partnerships and indigenous ways of knowing into
regional climate adaptation initiatives. Respondents underscored the
need for strong, trusted rela- tionships that respect the sovereignty
and priorities of Tribal nations to guide engagement. However,
non-Tribal organizations' own capacity constraints, perceived Tribal
capacity constraints, and institutional cultures rooted in colonialism
and structural racism were discussed as obstacles to meaningful
engagement. As such,]{.mark} we identify an urgent need to prioritize
sustained investments in both Tribal and non-Tribal actors' partnership
capaci- ties and climate change adaptation capabilities to place
Indigenous voices and needs at the forefront of regional climate change
adaptation planning and implementation.Climate change is resulting in
significant environmental changes, with cascading effects to human
health and well-being that disproportionately affect Indigenous lands
and Indigenous peoples [(Status of Tribes and Climate Change Working
Group (STACCWG), 2021). Accelerated sea level rise and extreme weather
events have already precipitated the dis- placement and forced
relocation of entire Indigenous communities, and experts warn that this
may continue for hundreds of communities living within the borders of
the United States (Maldonado et al. 2013; Stern 2020). These impacts are
exacerbated by the effects of poverty, dispossession, and globalization
that challenge the adaptive capacities of Indig- enous populations
throughout the world (Ford 2012). Moreover, given the importance of
place and connections to land that are particularly salient for many
Indigenous communi- ties, the environmental threats of a changing
climate constitute substantive threats to the wellbeing and the very
survival of Indigenous communities (Berkes 2017; Companion 2015;
Maldonado et al. 2015; Maldonado et al. 2014; Whyte 2013). As such, many
in the Indigenous climate justice movement echo warnings from leading
scientific consortia (e.g. IPCC, 2022; Reidmiller et al. 2018) and
"agree resolutely on the urgency of action to stop dangerous climate
change" (Whyte 2020:1).The intensity and the nature of climate-related
impacts in the United States are regionally specific (Reidmiller et al.
2018), varying based on natural environment (Giorgi et al. 1994;
Rasmussen et al. 2020) as well as regionally specific human activity
(Diffenbaugh et al. 2008). Though historically underexplored in academic
literature (Birkeland et al. 2018), cultural nuances also mediate
climate-related vulnerability and risk perception (Gautam et al. 2013;
Rühlemann and Jordan 2021; Thomas et al. 2019). For many American Indian
and Alaska Native communities in particular, the devastating effects of
climate change on cultural survival play a significant role in
determining Tribes' priorities for climate adapta- tion (Cochran et al.
2013; Maldonado et al. 2016).]{.mark}**[Recognizing the scope of the
challenges presented by climate change, organizations throughout the
world advocate for climate adaptation strategies developed through
cross- sector collaboration, government-to-government partnerships, and
collectives of multi- national non-government
organizations]{.underline}** [(National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine 2021). Dierwechter and Hale (2014:2) advocate
for strengthening regional planning processes and argue that
multi-jurisdictional planning "should be at the center of how we
ameliorate most of our major developmental challenges," including
climate action. However, the variation of regional climate change
impacts and the nuances of cultural norms and values in affected
communities also require that adaptation efforts are tailored to the
communities in which they are implemented, in order to reflect
communities' needs and priorities (Schramm et al. 2020). The breadth of
climate-related challenges, combined with the importance of nuanced
solutions, enhances the attractiveness of developing adap- tation
strategies that are tailored to fit the communities in which they are
implemented, but also robust enough to be effective (Kalafatis et al.
2015; Termeer et al. 2011).[Climate adaption entails an iterative
process in which communities assess risks and vul- nerability and
continually act to reduce risk]{.underline} (Lempert et al. 2018).
Though mitigation (e.g., reduction of greenhouse gases) has dominated
climate policy debates for decades, adaptation strategies have more
recently become crucial for addressing the effects of climate change
(Moser 2015; Moss et al. 2013). However]{.mark}, significant gaps remain
between adapta- ion theory and practice [(Biagini et al. 2014), as
reflected in the Fourth National Climate Assessment (Reidmiller et al.
2018), which indicates that implementation of adaptation activities is
on the rise, but "is not yet commonplace" (Lempert et al. 2018:1310).
Moreo- ver, the policy landscape where adaptation strategies might be
implemented is character- ized by confusion about the goals that should
be pursued, and by whom, and consists of a broad range of strategies and
policies (some of which are sector- or jurisdiction-specific) that,
Moser (2015:570) writes, "reflects the fact that adaptation policy must
meet many dif- ferent demands created by already apparent or expected
climate changes, which vary across regions, sectors and time, and often
also non-climatic goals."Yet, [indigenous peoples have been assessing
and adapting to climate-related risk since time
immemorial.]{.underline}]{.mark} [In [the words of a Swinomish Indian
Tribal Community member: "We've always been good at adaptation. You look
at the 500 years that the western civilizations have been here\... And
the Tribes are probably one of the best adapters of being able to
survive right along next to the western cultures"(SITC 2010:19).
Traditional practices have "been sustained through previous
world-altering changes \... it stands to reason that they will again
carry the people through this changing world, too" (Donatuto et al.
2021:160). Often, the climate adaptation strategies implemented among
Tribes are rooted in traditional knowledges that prioritize "attachment
to the local environment as a unique and irreplaceable
place"]{.mark}]{.underline} [(Berkes 2017:11). Many Indigenous peoples
and Tribal communities emphasize the importance of first foods, for
example, that have, "supported and nourished this land's first stewards
in a reciprocal relationship kept in a harmonic balance" (Dona- tuto et
al. 2021:159). Several Tribal nations have developed and executed
effective climate adaptation strategies, including, e.g., Karuk Tribe
(Norgaard 2014), Makah Tribe (Chang 2018), Swinomish Indian Tribal
Community (SITC 2010).Notably, the accelerating urgency of Tribes' need
to implement climate adaptation strategies is largely due to human
activity occurring outside of Tribal lands and beyond the con- trol of
Tribal governments. More broadly, as described in a collaborative report
on climate change and indigenous peoples (Norton-Smith et al. 2016:3),
"Indigenous vulnerability and resilience to climate change cannot be
detached from the context of colonialism, which created both the
economic conditions for anthropogenic climate change and the social con-
ditions that limit indigenous resistance and resilience capacity." As
such, **[immediate action to redress these dilemmas is a moral
imperative]{.underline}** (Jerolleman 2019; Whyte 2013).Though
collaborative efforts are often espoused as important solutions for
addressing cli- mate change, those that link Tribal communities and
non-Tribal entities require particular attention. [Relationships between
Tribes and Federal government entities are shaped by Fed- eral trust
obligations to Tribes in which, "the United States has recognized and
must protect the Tribal right to self-government, the right to exist as
distinct peoples on their own lands, as well as remaining Indian trust
assets" (NCAI, 2015, p. 1). In practice, a variety of pol- icy
strategies are used to meet these obligations. When it comes to how
Federal employees should engage with Tribes, for example, Executive
Order 13,175 (Exec. Order No. 13175 (2000) articulates Federal agencies'
obligations to consult and coordinate with Tribal governments when
developing policies that have Tribal implications, and was recently
reaf- firmed and extended in a Presidential Memorandum]{.underline}
(Memorandum 2021) that called on agencies to strengthen existing Tribal
Consultation policies. However, funding issues and policy constraints
continue to emerge as barriers for practical progress on climate-related
collaboration with, or support for, Tribal nations (Bierbaum et al.
2013). Continued debate about how these obligations should be realized
is further complicated by the rapidly appar- ent impacts of climate
change that have displaced Tribal communities from the land that these
obligations are designed to protect (Jessee 2020; Maldonado et al. 2013;
Stern 2020).Federal policies and initiatives that are subject to these
trust obligations are often imple-mented at regional and local levels,
in Federal offices located throughout the country (Jones 2018). [Tribal
nations have collaborated with Federal agencies on a number of cli-
mate-related projects in the Pacific Northwest and throughout the United
States. These col- laborations include, for example, direct partnerships
between the Makah tribe and the U.S. Coast Guard (McLelland and Kennard
2021), and between the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS 2021)]{.underline}. T[here are also a number of
multi-party regional collaborations that bring together actors from a
several different enti- ties (e.g., tribal nations, universities,
non-profit organizations, and government agencies from multiple levels).
The Tribal Coastal Resilience Portfolio, developed by the North- west
Climate Resilience Collaborative, for example, is a collaboration
between the Affili- ated Tribes of Northwest Indians, University of
Washington, the Washington Sea Grant, and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (Climate Impacts Group 2022).]{.underline}
Similarly, University of Oregon's Tribal Climate Change Project began as
a collaboration between the University and the U.S. Forest Service, and
now includes partners from a wide range of sectors, including multiple
levels of government, Tribal-serving organizations, and education and
advocacy organizations (University of Oregon 2022).At the regional
level, where organizations seeking to engage with Tribal nations include
Federal entities as well as state and local governments and
non-government organizations, the complexity of collaboration for
climate adaptation is further amplified. In this context, to the extent
that the number of entities who might engage with Tribes increases, so
too does the number of policies and best practices, which often vary
from State to State and agency to agency. However, despite this
complexity, and despite the importance of region- ally and culturally
nuanced adaptation solutions, less attention has been paid to regionally
specific processes for direct partnerships between tribes and non-Tribal
entities.One explanation for this may be the central **[importance of
protecting nation-to- nation relationships at the federal level that
recognize and reaffirm the sovereign nation status of federally
recognized Tribes.]{.underline}** While the National Congress of
American Indi- ans (NCAI) emphasizes this importance, they also
expressly support and encourage collaborative relationships and formal
agreements between tribal governments and state and local government
entities (NCAI, n.d.). However, [collaboration at \[state\] this level
is often complicated by the fact that relationships between Tribal
nations and the State (or States) that border their lands are often
fraught with historical tensions, political issues, and legal battles in
which Tribal Nations seek to assert and retain sovereign rights and
augment self-determination (Hanna et al. 2011**).**]{.underline}The
State of Washington's Centennial Accord (and the subsequently
implemented New Millennium Agreement) represents an attempt to codify
the nature of what a government- to-government relationship could or
should look like between a state and a tribal nation. This arrangement
specifies that the development and implementation of government-to-
government policies, and the associated accountability for doing so, are
the responsibility of each individual state agency (GOIA 1999, 1989).
However, it [does not provide guid- ance for many of the nuances that
may affect relationship-building at state and local levels,]{.underline}
including, for example, the range of barriers to this type of work
reported by Hanson et al. (2020) that include issues of trust and
transparency, unclear expectations, and institutional mismatches.Tribal
perspectives on climate-related collaboration provide insight for this
research, and are particularly useful for contextualizing the
recommendations we have developed based on this research (which appear
in "Sect. 4"). The Tribal Climate Change Principles (TCCPs) (Gruenig et
al. 2015) were developed in order to address the needs of Indigenous
peoples for climate adaptation, through advancing recommendations for
federal action. These principles are supported by many Indigenous
groups, yet remain under-utilized in practice, and fall into the
following four categories: (1) strengthen tribal sovereignty in the
climate change era; (2) support tribes facing immediate threats from
climate change; (3) ensure tribal access to climate change resources;
and, (4) ensure an understanding of when and how the use of traditional
knowledge may be applied. The TCCP report also contains recommendations
for TCCP implementation, as well as identifies inherent challenges for
doing so. While the specific recommendations contained in the TCCPs are
aimed primar- ily at broad federal processes/interactions, the core
principles offer a useful framework for understanding challenges related
to supporting tribal nations, and provide context for the process of
developing and maintaining tribal partnerships at regional levels.This
research is part of a larger tribally led project designed to develop an
Indigenous model to address climate adaptation and climate-related
health issues at the community level. Previous work on this project has
developed the Indigenous Health Indicators and Indigenous Building
Resilience Against Climate Effects (I-BRACE) model, each of which were
designed and produced by the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community to
illustrate Swinomish world views on health and to integrate such
worldviews into a climate adapta- tion approach for state and local
public health agencies. The I-BRACE model is adapted from the U.S.
Centers for Disease and Prevention climate health assessment model,
BRACE (Schramm et al. 2020). It is our hope that these types of
indigenous models will be useful for informing best practices for
climate adaptation among both tribal and non-tribal entities, and that,
in keeping with best practices and recommendations about Indigenous
knowledge sovereignty, they will be incorporated into the climate
adaptation work of non- tribal entities via collaborative partnerships
with the tribal nations that chose to use them. To that end, our
research is interested in exploring the kinds of opportunities and chal-
lenges that shape the actions and decisions of those who work in
non-tribal institutions, in order to better understand the nuances of
developing regional partnerships that both advance shared climate
adaptation goals and consider the unique goals, challenges,
andcapacities of tribal partners. Specifically, this study sought to
understand challenges faced and opportunities available to non-tribal
entities wishing to engage with tribes on regional climate change
adaptation initiatives, and is complementary to work such as the TCCPs
(Gruenig et al. 2015) that explores tribal perspectives on these
issues.Semi-structured interviews that inform this research leverage the
experience of key informants who work in organizations that engage in
the development or implemen- tation of climate adaptation policy, and
whose professional responsibilities include activities that serve these
policy-related goals and/or that focus on tribal engage- ment in the
U.S. Pacific Northwest. This qualitative approach allows us to explore
respondents' perceptions about policy issues, institutional goals and
priorities, and their potential tribal partners, and to capture the
richness of respondents' institu tional knowledge and experiences that
elucidate the nuances of the challenges they describe. As a result, the
findings of this research contribute an increased understand- ing of
tribal engagement processes at the regional level, and inform
recommenda- tions designed to support the key components advanced by the
TCCPs as they may be applied to the regional level.We conducted
semi-structured key informant interviews, and analyzed the information
gathered using a modified grounded theory approach that incorporates
flexible coding and thematic analysis. Using a purposive sampling
approach to iteratively select partic- ipants based on their unique
capacities to inform the research (Rubin and Rubin 2012) and to
highlight the array of knowledges that inform this study (Glaser and
Strauss 2017), we interviewed individuals who work in public and/or
non-profit agencies in the Northwest region of the United States. We
identified key informants through pro- fessional networks, and
additional participants were identified using a snowball sam- pling
approach, wherein participants recommended others who met inclusion
criteria (Becker 1963; McNamara 1994). Sampling sought to balance the
types of organiza- tions represented, including both government and
non-government organizations, and to ensure that government
organizations represented multiple levels (e.g., local, state and
federal). Similarly, sampling sought to ensure diverse professional
expertise and activities, including climate, health, and tribal
engagement. Throughout data collec- tion, we continually reassessed our
sampling strategy to target participants that could further illuminate
developing themes.**2.2 Data *collection and analysis***We recruited
participants via email, where we provided them with an overview of the
study and an invitation to participate in a video or telephone interview
at a mutually conveni- ent time. All interviews occurred during regular
business hours via video conference (e.g., Zoom). Interviews were
recorded (audio and video), and audio recordings wereprofession- ally
transcribed for data=analysis.A semi-structured interview guide was
developed a priori based on the study aim and objectives, and asked
questions clustered around three main topics: (1) climateClimatic Change
(2023) 176:27 Page 7 of 22 27change activities that respondents'
organizations currently pursue or wish to pursue (2) what tribal
engagement looks like for them, what they want it to look like, and the
bar- riers and opportunities for getting there and (3) the types of
variations in approaches to climate change adaptation that they have
observed between tribes and their own organ-izations. The interview
guide was developed/reviewed by four research team members and piloted
with the fifth member, to ensure that questions were understandable and
answerable.Transcribed interviews were coded using the main constructs
that reflect the inter- view questions, including climate change
adaptation and health-related activities and goals, the nature of tribal
partnerships, and the processes of acknowledging and inte- grating a
variety of knowledge and approaches to these topics. Initial coding
followed the logic of the first stages of Deterding and Waters' (2018)
flexible coding approach, in which descriptive index codes, developed
based on the concepts that organize the interview guide, are applied
throughout each interview. The converse of the line-by- line open coding
(e.g., in vivo coding) that often guides grounded theory approaches,
this approach is designed lytical phases were developed by summarizing
and synthesizing the main themes rep- resented by each of these six
index codes, for each individual interview. For each of these memos,
segments were summarized and then synthesized, proceeding in code order,
as enumerated above (rather than in the order in which segments appeared
in the transcript). Transcripts were annotated concurrently with the
coding process; for example, with the letters "A," "G," and "T" to
represent "Activities," "Goals," and "Challenges," or one or two words
that describe the nature of the barrier or facilitator being discussed.
Memos included thematic summaries and supporting quotations.Each memo
was sent to the respective respondent in order to check the credibility
of the synthesized data (i.e., member checking) (Lincoln & Guba 1985).
Respondents were informed that these summaries would be the basis of
ongoing analysis and were invited to offer comments or revisions. About
20% of participants provided feedback, and their revisions were
reflected in the final respondent memos.In the second main stage of
analysis, respondent memos were treated as data, fol- lowing Averill
(2002), where matrix analysis allowed for cross-case comparison of memo
segments, grouped by index code. Through this process, segments were
further reduced to a few key analytic themes in each matrix cell and
reassembled based on thematic common thematic elements across cases.
Thematic memos were developed and cross-checked with the original
interview transcript to ensure confirmability and increase the
trustworthiness of each theme (Lincoln & Guba 1985).27 Page 8 of 22
Climatic Change (2023) 176:27 **3 Results3.1 Participants *and
engagement characteristics***Eighteen of the 22 invited individuals
chose to participate in the study (response rate 81.8%). Respondents
represent 14 different agencies and organizations and have expertise
that spans climate change, environmental health, hazards mitigation, and
tribal engagement (Table 1).Respondents' characterizations of their own
occupational responsibilities for tribal engagement range from those who
have no direct or specific responsibilities in this area to those whose
primary job is to directly support tribal work and act on behalf of
tribes in non-tribal settings (Table 2). Note that these descriptions
reflect respondents' characteri- zations of their individual
responsibilities as assigned to them by their respective organi-
zations; they do not necessarily reflect respondents' beliefs about
their personal responsi- bilities, nor do they reflect overall
organizational responsibilities or constraints that may restrict working
with tribes.All respondents from non-tribal organizations indicated
interest in engaging with tribes. Many respondents explicitly
articulated their interest, and several also demonstrated their interest
by describing examples of successful partnership activities that they
have pur- sued in the past. Characteristics of tribal relationships by
organization type are described in Table 3. Respondents from federal
entities report relationships that are General lack of
relationshipsThough they have monthly meetings with local jurisdictions,
"we're doing nothing with Tribes \... but I do feel like we could be
doing more and want us to be doing more."University/research
organizationStrong relationships based on Tribally led/co-led
projectsLimited relationships, based on spe- cific funding
opportunities"We are in the process of growing our program to better
serve all communities in this area -- including for Tribes, so please
understand these efforts are still very much in the learning
phase."Large projects with multiple tribes and other non-Tribal
organizations27 Page 10 of 22 Climatic Change (2023) 176:27on tribes'
being awarded federal funding. State government entities describe
attempts to develop relationships by inviting tribes into their
organization's projects, but report that they generally lack strong
relationships with tribes. Respondents at the county level describe
strong one-to-one partnerships on specific projects with neighboring
tribes where both entities are facing the same climate-related
challenges, but that (like states) they strug- gle to develop
collaborative relationships based on their own projects. Finally,
respondents in research settings report very strong relationships with
tribes, characterized by tribally led or co-led projects that they have
the opportunity to support (with funding and/or exper- tise).
Respondents from inter-tribal organizations echo these sentiments, "For
the most part, the states are willing and would like to work with the
Tribes."Regardless of the nature or extent of engagement respondents
describe, all discuss want- ing to improve these efforts, with some
describing specific strategies or plans to do so. Respondents in federal
organizations report wanting to include a greater number of tribes in
the programs they oversee by reducing barriers for tribes to access
funds. Respondents at the state and county levels describe wanting to
improve engagement by more intentionally and systematically reaching out
to tribes and describe potential avenues to do so, such as hiring
additional staff devoted to tribal outreach, and planning future events
designed specifically to support tribes. One of these respondents also
describes the value of their professional net- works, and reports that
having tribal representatives in leadership roles has been a beneficial
avenue for developing relationships with tribes. Among researchers,
where tribal engage- ment is strong, respondents report that because
their engagement is largely in response to tribes who request support,
they are working on developing relationships with a greater number of
tribes (in order to increase the opportunities for tribes to request
support).Though respondents were not explicitly asked what motivates
them to work with tribes, some respondents from non-tribal organizations
did articulate their rationales for engaging with tribes, which included
(in descending order of frequency mentioned): (a) identifying common
best practices for addressing climate change, which might be mutually
beneficial collaborative activities; (b) getting a more complete picture
of climate-related vulnerabil- ity (at the state and federal levels, for
tribes with land in their region); and (c) coordinat- ing with neighbors
on regionally specific climate risks (which is crucial because, as one
respondent stated, "risks don't care about borders").Respondents also
describe the potential benefits of non-tribal organizations develop- ing
a better understanding of Indigenous approaches to climate change. As
one respond- ent from a state agency points out, "those Tribal
perspectives and knowledge and values can only help us, so including
them from the beginning will actually make your project stronger." A few
respondents describe their understanding of Indigenous approaches to
addressing climate change and explain that some of the most common
features of indig- enous ways of knowing are beneficial for informing
climate adaptation and environmental health strategies. For example,
some point to the principles of intergenerational equity that is often
associated with viewing climate change on a longer term basis, and a
connection to the natural environment that positions humans as stewards
of the land rather than its set- tlers. Respondents with expertise in
environmental health point out the subjectivity of the concept of
health, and praise indigenous frameworks that include cultural survival,
natu- ral surroundings and a thriving community as important components
of health. They also describe the commitment of many tribes to gathering
community input and explain that these commitments would enhance the
efforts of their own agencies to engage in "whole community health." One
respondent adds that indigenous perspectives on environmental and human
interconnectedness may be beneficial for helping non-Indigenous people
better13Climatic Change (2023) 176:27 Page 11 of 22 27 see the
interconnectedness in their own cultures, thereby helping to increase
the urgency ofaddressing climate change.**3.2 Goals and best practices
for tribal engagement**Nearly all respondents argued that the most
effective partnerships with tribes for climate change adaptation are
those based on meaningful relationships built on mutual trust and
respect. They explain that these kinds of relationships are developed
over a significant period of time, often through existing personal and
professional connections where trust has already been established.
Respondents offered several examples of strategies for pursu- ing these
kinds of relationships in a tribal context. One respondent in a
government set- ting relied on relationships with tribes that they had
developed in their previous work in the private sector. Others describe
working on small collaborative climate initiatives for the express
purpose of developing strong personal relationships. A number of
respondents also report relying on intermediaries who have more
established relationships with tribes, including tribal liaisons,
inter-tribal coalitions, and tribal leaders with whom they have already
worked (creating something of a snowball effect).\]Respondents
identified several principles and best practices viewed as crucial for
developing high-quality relationships, including communication, goal
alignment, and mutually beneficial relationships and projects. Most
respondents in non-tribal organi- zations describe these principles as
ideals to which they aspire in their work (for which inter-tribal
coalition representatives also indicated support). However, these
practices were sometimes discussed in the context of additional steps
that should be taken when working with tribes, or as a way of describing
how current/common standards are insufficient for achieving these
ideals.Many respondents from government agencies referred to the process
of Tribal Consulta- tion as a standard practice for working tribes.
Tribal Consultation, as described by respond- ents, is a legally
required process designed to encourage government agencies to consider
the impact of their work on tribes, inform tribes of that potential
impact, and invite tribes to participate or be represented in that work.
However, many respondents argued that existing Tribal Consultation
requirements are insufficient for developing the quality of
relationships that support successful collaboration with tribes. For
example, one respondent working in a state agency explains that the
"Dear Tribal Leader" letter is "kind of the checkbox that we are meeting
the statutory requirement. It definitely does not replace the
programmatic relationships and meetings and interactions. I think, for
me, that has been where most of our work has gotten done."**3.3
*Barriers* for tribal engagement**Respondents described a wide variety
of barriers for tribal engagement, which were devel- oped into the three
main analytical themes. Capacity limitations among organizations of all
types as well as tribal nations stand out as the most commonly
identified barrier to devel- oping partnerships on climate change
related initiatives. Limitations for all of these entities include
financial support and staffing, as well as other resources such as
climate expertise and professional social capital. Respondents also
described the institutional dynamics that underlie these capacity
issues, and create additional barriers, often in the form of policies
and institutional norms, that constrain respondents' abilities to
effectively engage tribes.1327 Page 12 of 22 Climatic Change (2023)
176:273.3.1 Non‐tribal organization capacity constraintsThe majority of
respondents in non-tribal organizations pointed out that they do not
have steady streams of funding dedicated to tribal engagement, and
instead must depend on ad hoccongressional appropriations and
competitive grants. They explained that without such funding, their
engagement with tribes is often limited to (1) respond- ing to tribes
who approach their offices with specific requests for support and/or (2)
developing strong relationships with only a very limited number of
tribes. A few respondents expanded on these limitations, explaining that
with finite funding and broad responsibilities "choosing to do work with
Tribes necessarily means limiting other activities."Relatedly,
respondents explained that they lack sufficient personnel for developing
strong relationships with tribes, and often must rely on a tribal
liaison (if one exists within their organization) or inter-tribal
organizations as their primary avenues for developing relationships. The
tribal liaisons who participated in this study added that, as a result
of these personnel issues, they often feel as though they are the sole
connec- tion between thousands of agency employees and all of the tribes
in their region. One of the respondents representing an inter-tribal
organization added that while they are glad to support these
relationships, it should be the responsibility of each government agency
to ensure that their employees have the necessary training and
capacities to work with tribes, so that the responsibility of
coordinating with tribes is not shifted to tribally-led organizations or
to tribes themselves.Capacity limitations of non-tribal organizations
determine not only whether engagement can happen, but also significantly
impact the quality of that engagement. As respondents explained the
importance of meaningful relationships for address- ing the effects of
climate change in front line communities, they lack the capacity to
develop the kinds of relationships that they believe to be necessary for
effective engagement or collaboration, which take time. For example,
they discussed that part- nering with tribes on climate issues requires
long-term commitments of both person- nel and resources: "We want to
make sure that every interaction is meaningful and that we are able to
commit to provide the level of relationships and assistance that is
helpful for the Tribe."Finally, respondents (especially those in federal
government roles) explained their beliefs that capacity limitations are
rooted in the failure of their organizations to pri- oritize tribal
engagement. As one tribal liaison puts it, "Agencies show their support
through funding. \...There may be initiatives going on, but it's really
through-- agencies get the work done with funding." Another participant
explains, for example, that their agency's leadership has made great
strides to prioritize working with tribes, they are still dependent on
congressional funding to move forward on any given project. With regard
to climate-related projects that could help them engage tribes, they
explain that,*Congress hasn't created any of this. The agencies are
doing what they can with the resources they have, but Congress has not
created climate change programs. They haven't said, \"Here, guys. Each
of you will set up a new division only for climate change. And here is
funding to get that work done.\" \... Leadership, I believe, really
wants to do this. But the Congressional, the legislation to support the
agencies, to open the door and the path, and give them the resources
hasn't been created.*13Climatic Change (2023) 176:27 Page 13 of 22
273.3.2 Perceived ***tribal capacity limitations***As respondents
described their attempts to engage with tribal nations, most of them
pointed to their perception of limited tribal capacities as a
significant barrier that affects respondents'decisions about what kinds
of engagement activities they pursue, and how successful they believe
those to be. Notably, both government employees and those from
tribal-serving organizations described this as a significant issue, and
it is our intention to report respondents' perceptions about and
experiences with tribal capacity limitations in the context of tribal
partnerships. More importantly, these findings are not intended to speak
for tribes about their capacity limitations, but rather to echo and
support the con- cerns that many tribal leaders and scholars have
already expressed (Bennett et al. 2014; Chino and Debruyn 2006;
Chischilly et al. 2022) They explain that the most effective climate
adaptation solutions are locally driven, and require capacities that
many tribes lack. As one respondent in a state agency describes:"Even if
state or federal programs did have more robust capacities, it's critical
for communities to have resources and staff tolead planning efforts so
solutions are tailored. In my experience, it seems like many Tribes,
similar to local govern- ments, simply don't have thecapacity to have
someone working on climate change adaptation in any formal or full-time
capacity. ***Solutions need tobe locally driven so they are tailored to
fit each community.\"***Respondents commonly described their perception
that Tribes do not have the per- sonnel capacity to respond to tribal
consultation requests from the vast number of exter- nal agencies who
contact them, nor the resources to devote to these multiple collabo-
rative projects. For example, one respondent recalls his interaction
with a tribal staff member responsible for reviewing tribal consultation
letters who told him, "I review a hundred of these in a morning, and I
maybe send one or two on to our leadership because we don't have a
subject matter expert for each of these things who is going to take this
issue on." Several respondents go on to explain their beliefs that
because of these limitations, it is especially important to value any
time the tribe is willing to invest, and some describe additional
pressure that this can create to do engagement well. In the words of one
respondent:I definitely feel at a loss for how to pursue those
relationships and how to make sure that we're bringing *value, and not
just a drain on people's time and resources, because they're
understaffed and under-resourced, and have their own things going
on.*Several respondents emphasized the importance of a broader awareness
among non- tribal entities about the effects of capacity limitations as
they create policies that affect tribes and especially as they develop
best practices with regard to tribal engagement. These respondents
pointed out that current strategies to engage with tribes (such as the
tribal consultation process described above) often fail to engage tribes
who do not have the capacity to partner, and as a result, may perpetuate
"lopsided development, where those Tribes most in need are the least
likely to get resources."Respondents also described several ways tribes
are excluded at the institutional level, and the effects of this type of
systematic exclusion on their attempts to develop effective partnerships
with tribes. Exclusion from climate-related funding was the most common
explanation given for the tribal capacity issues discussed above, and
comes in1327 Page 14 of 22 Climatic Change (2023) 176:27a variety of
forms. As one inter-tribal organization representative explained, for
exam- ple, tribes are denied access to funding "through \[insufficient\]
guidance, through cul- turally inaccessible programs, through lack of
effective communication. Access is a real problem." Other respondents
echoed these sentiments and cited exclusion climate- related funding as
a significant source of the capacity issues that hinder robust tribal
engagement on climate-related projects.Respondents working in government
roles most commonly pointed to funding opportunities that fail to
consider the needs (and the value) of tribal climate adaptation
projects. They explain that the funding guidelines on which they must
base their deci- sions lead them to reject a number of excellent climate
adaptation projects that tribes are working on. As one respondent
describes this phenomenon, "grant funding deci- sions are often times
made by staff, based on programmatic guidelines \[that need to be\]
revised to be more culturally appropriate."Another respondent who works
primarily in emergency management explained that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency mitigation grants are designed specifi- cally for
critical infrastructure projects, rather than protection or management
of natu- ral resources. Since many tribes' mitigation plans focus on
protection of the natural environment, rather than critical
infrastructure, they are excluded from this funding. In another example,
respondents in a federal government setting described emerging needs
among tribal nations, for which there simply is no existing funding
stream to support. As they explain,*I have one Tribe that I work with
that is struggling to find funding for a lift sta- tion. As the tides
are coming* in *higher, and the rivers are rising, their lift sta- tion
at their sewer system needs to be upgraded,* \$30,000. Don't have it.
*Can't find it.* That's the climate change impact. And so just even a
multimedia funding approach would be excellent \-- just to fund the
needs \[described in funding appli- cations\] *I think would allow us to
be more responsive. **We would be able to meet the Tribes where they
are, with what they're already telling us their need is.***Many
respondents working in state and federal government roles argue
exclusion from these funding mechanisms also limits opportunities for
more individual engage- ment and professional connections. They explain
that much of their work is focused on supporting jurisdictions that
apply for and receive funding from their agencies, which creates a
foundation for developing professional relationships.Researchers and
those working in non-government organizations also described issues with
funding mechanisms, which function differently but may have similar
effects. Namely, they explain that the grant-funding they rely on to
carry out their work functions within a system that privileges
settler-colonial institutions (at the expense of tribes). As such, they
argue that this type of funding often fails to honor tribal sov-
ereignty and self-determination, diminishing the quality of engagement.
For example, one researcher explains that,My work is not perfect.
*There's* still a lot of problems with the way I do my work, right? I'm
still working within existing power structures that give increased
legitimacy to *Western science, and I'm in a settler-colonial
institution, and I'm white. I mean, it's problematic still. And I'm
getting the money \-- I'm applying for grants. They're not giving the
money directly to the Tribes, usually. I mean, increasingly, that's
changing, but it's still super problematic.*13Climatic Change (2023)
176:27 Page 15 of 22 273.3.3 Institutional***constraints***Respondents
also describe a number of institutional/bureaucratic constraints that
make Tribal engagement more difficult in their own work. Several
respondents explicitly described the flexibility that researchers and
non-government organizations have(com- pared to government agencies), in
terms of the work they choose to do and how they carry it out. For
example, some of the non-government employees described the freedom that
they have to work on tribally led projects, as opposed to agency-led
projects that may seek tribal representation. They echo the sentiment of
one respondent who explained their belief that they probably have "much
more flexibility than most people in government because I'm at an
organization whose mission is to do this work and was set up to do
it."Respondents from government settings also described the constraints
of processes and tools that comprise many of the best practices and
standard operating procedures in their field (e.g., state and local
planning requirements) yet are not applicable or helpful for tribes, and
thus create barriers for effectively collaborating with and supporting
tribes. They explain that because of this relative lack of freedom, it
is more difficult for them to col- laborate with their tribal neighbors
who "often put energy into things and focus on things that non-Tribal
communities cannot \[because\] there is a certain set of things they
have to do that are defined by state law." Moreover, because these
practices are so ingrained in the way they approach climate-related
issues, they often feel as though they have little to offer tribes in
terms of non-material support such as guidance or personnel.**4
Discussion**]{.mark}In a recent essay, leading indigenous climate change
scholar, Kyle Whyte (2020, p. 1), reflects on the importance of
meaningful relationships as a cornerstone of collaborative action to
address climate change, and argues that a relational tipping point may
have already been crossed, whic[h will ultimately preclude the
possibility for achieving climate justice for some indigenous groups. As
Whyte (2020:1) writes, "the qualities of relationships connect- ing
indigenous peoples with other societies' governments, nongovernmental
organizations, and corporations are not conducive to coordinated action
that would avoid further injustice against indigenous peoples in the
process of responding to climate change."Through this qualitative
research, we provide nuanced descriptions of factors that chal- lenge
non-tribal actors from such meaningful engagement with tribes to advance
climate adaptation and address adverse health effects of climate change.
Insights from conversations confirm that meaningful collaboration with
and support for tribes may be a long way off with- out a paradigmatic
cultural shift in how climate change adaptation efforts are conceived
and prioritized. Adequate and appropriate tribal engagement in regional
climate adaptation activi- ties is precluded by non-tribal organization
capacity constraints, the effects of tribal capacity constraints, and
underlying institutional dynamics rooted in colonialism and structural
rac- ism that constrain organizations from meaningful and equitable
collaboration. However, we submit that opportunities to improve
engagement---namely through prioritizing investments in capacity among
tribal and non-tribal organizations for collaborative climate change
adap- tation, and dismantling colonial structures that prioritize
western science and approaches to adaptation---can facilitate regional
climate change adaptation collaborations that center the voices, needs,
and prioritizes of Indigenous peoples and tribal nations.1327 Page 16 of
22 Climatic Change (2023) 176:27**4.1 Initiating and *developing
engagement with tribes***Practical barriers for initiating and
developing relationships (of any kind) with tribes are evident
throughout the results described here and include limited funding for
personnel/ activities dedicated to tribal partnerships, ambiguous
policies, and unclear direction about whether and how to engage tribes,
as well as programs and funding mechanisms that fail to meet tribes'
specific needs. As a result, partnerships that may significantly enhance
sup- port for tribal nations at the greatest risk are thwarted by a lack
of capacity among regional agencies as well as exclusionary policy and
funding mechanisms that fail to consider tribes' unique needs and
priorities and thus determine which tribes they ultimately partner with.
Central to the TCCPs is the call for direct, equitable support for
tribes to address the effects of climate change (Gruenig et al. 2015).
However, developing tribal partnerships that help facilitate support
that is both direct and equitable requires efforts that are inten-
tional, rather than incidental. Doing so requires adequate staffing with
flexible funding that can meet tribal nations where they are.
Specifically, individuals in government agencies who are responsible for
doing this type of work need clear policy directives that prioritize
tribal engagement coupled with dedicated and flexible funding.**4.2
Building *high‐quality relationships***Respondents overwhelmingly
reported wanting to engage with tribal nations more effec- tively,
moving beyond statutory requirements for engagement that often view
tribal engage- ment as a static binary (i.e., measuring whether they
*did* or*did not* engage tribes). The findings above regarding the use
of letters that fulfill tribal consultation requirements are evidence of
this point. These statutory requirements are those developed in
government set- tings, often to respond to broad executive orders and
government-wide mandates that are often designed to address the unique
socio-political relationships that tribes have with sev- eral levels of
government (e.g., Exec. Order No. 13175 2000). Voicing their desires to
move beyond what is merely required of them, respondents described
several measures of quality that they aim for in their engagement
activities (e.g., aligning goals with those of their tribal partners),
as they develop meaningful relationships based on mutual trust and
respect.Ultimately, these meaningful relationships of trust are critical
to honoring the sover- eignty and self-determination of tribes as
described in the first major component of the TCCPs (Gruenig et al.
2015). These high-quality relationships may allow for more con- sistent
and thorough communication that ensures the free, prior, and informed
consent of tribal partners and enhances the likelihood that tribal
partners will be represented in spaces where climate change adaptation
decisions are being made. However, as respondents from all sectors and
organization types affirm, developing these relationships requires
signifi- cant investments of time and effort. This is in part because
tribal nations---even those in the same geographic regions---are unique
independent entities with varied histories, cul- tures, and practices.
The relationships that are developed with these tribes must therefore be
equally unique. Moreover, the unique socio-historical context of
relationships between tribes and government entities requires additional
attention and care on the part of non- tribal actors, which may not be
required for other non-tribal communities and groups. As such, in
addition to the funding and clear directives that are foundational for
developing partnerships, a cultural shift in how this work is approached
in government organizations is necessary to meaningfully encourage and
support the development of relationships with tribal partners.Climatic
Change (2023) 176:27 Page 17 of 22 27**4.3 Building *tribal capacity for
partnership***One of the most significant issues that respondents
described is their perceptions about tribal capacity being insufficient
to adequately address the effects of climate change or to devote time
and resources to climate-related partnerships with non-tribal
institutions. These perceived capacity issues are exacerbated by the
number of agencies and organiza- tions that ask tribes to engage with
them on a vast range of issues, which may be the result of statutory
requirements for tribal engagement that respondents described. These
findings demonstrate a range of underlying issues that, if not
addressed, will ultimately preclude any hope of developing climate
adaptation solutions in partnership with tribal nations. As addressed in
the TCCPs, climate change programs and resources are often inaccessible
or unavailable for tribal nations. The need to redress this issue is
exigent (Gruenig et al.2015). Our findings demonstrate the additional
effects of deeper issues that require long- term, systematic support for
capacity-building in tribal nations. Specifically, absent of the
capacity-building that takes place over generations, many tribes do not
have the personnel and resources to devote to partnerships, which, our
findings reveal, have significant bearing on how non-tribal actors
approach and engage tribal partners to develop relationships. As such,
we echo the recommendations of the TCCPs that call for equitable access
to fund- ing initiatives to provide crucial support for both immediate
and long-term climate-related issues. We also advocate for systematic
program funding that will support the continued development of tribal
personnel who can consistently serve to represent the needs and pri-
orities of their nations in collaborations that involve non-Tribal
agencies.**4.4 Tribally led climate engagement**Our findings reveal
important insights about how non-tribal agencies engage with tribes,
specifically in terms of whether and to what extent respondents (and
their organizations) are supporting tribally led projects versus seeking
tribal representation in their own ongo- ing work. The findings
presented in Table 3 reveal a potential pattern in which state agen-
cies may be more focused on seeking input from tribes on their own
projects, compared to those at the federal level, where engaging with
tribal nations is typically tied to funding mechanisms that support
tribes' adaptation solutions (notably, however, several conditions for
that support limit the eligibility of many of these tribally led
projects). As we compare the work of those in government agencies with
those working in research settings, it is apparent that the relative
freedom and flexibility that researchers enjoy in their work may lead to
more robust relationships that support initiatives that are tribally
led.As is evident throughout the TCCPs, when it comes to government
settings, each of these types of activities (ensuring meaningful
representation and supporting tribally led initiatives) are essential to
advance climate adaptation solutions that will benefit tribal nations.
However, effectively engaging in both types of activities requires each
of the foun- dational components that we have recommended thus far, as
well as significant and mean- ingful institutional changes that center
equity and justice as their core purpose.**4.5 Limitations and *future
research***This exploratory research intentionally focused on the
barriers facing non-tribal actorsand organizations when engaging with
tribes on regional initiatives for climate changeadaptation, as well as
perceived opportunities to enhance collaboration and partner- ship.
Although our findings align with and build on challenges identified in
the TCCPs, which were developed through contributions of Tribal
representatives, the TCCPs focus is on principles for federal
partnership. Future research must center the perspectives of tribal
representatives on these issues to ensure challenges and solutions
identified integrate their perspectives and align with their needs and
priorities. Additionally, while our qualitative approach, including use
of purposive sampling to include diverse per- spectives in terms of
organization type, sector, and professional role, allowed for deep
exploration of contextual nuances, our study sampling frame is
geographically con- strained to the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Given
regionally specific climate impacts Dif- fenbaugh et al. 2008), along
with divergent state and local approaches to climate adap- tation and
tribal engagement, follow-up research should seek to expound on findings
in different geographic and political contexts, both within and outside
of the United States. Moreover, this research sought to explore common
challenges faced by sub- national actors, not to identify differences
among sectors or stakeholder groups (e.g., public health or forestry).
Future research should explore differences in barriers to tribal
engagement, as well as to highlight successful strategies that have been
implemented, to promote more equitable and inclusive approaches to
climate change adaptation that can be adopted by other
sectors.]{.mark}Equitable approaches to climate change adaptation
require centering the voices, needs, and priorities of indigenous
peoples. As such, tribal nations must be intentionally and meaning-
fully engaged in regional climate change adaptation initiatives. Despite
tribally led rec- ommendations for federal actions that address the
needs of indigenous peoples in climate adaptation (i.e., the TCCPs),
sub-national actors still face substantial organizational capacity and
bureaucratic constraints to collaborating with tribes on regional
climate adaptation. **[Given regional impacts of climate change, it is
imperative that sustained investments are injected in both tribal and
sub-national non-tribal actors' (including state and local govern- ment
agencies, inter-tribal organizations, and universities/research
organizations) partner- ship capacity and technical capabilities to
ensure indigenous voices and needs are at the forefront of localized
approaches to adaptation.]{.underline}**

This second lens is something that Redwheel is actively researching and
investing in. Portfolio manager Amanda O'Toole and Stephanie Kelly, who
leads Redwheel's thematic sustainability research division, Greenwheel,
told [it's essential]{.underline} for financial institutions [to start
having more genuine conversations about what it looks like to invest in
adaptation solutions because "the need is now"]{.underline}. Nicole Lim,
ESG investment manager in fixed income at abrdn, agreed, saying
adaptation "is an area where many investors are still catching up",
[especially regarding identifying opportunities that meaningfully build
resilience against physical climate risks]{.underline}. **["A common
misconception is the exclusion of adaptation within transition-focused
investing. A just transition should encompass both mitigating climate
risks, as well as adapting to them]{.underline}**," Lim asserted. Kelly
also highlighted this problem, explaining **[adaptation "has got a bad
rap" because it's associated with giving up on mitigation and being
resigned to letting climate change happen unabated -- something she
describes as a fundamental mistake]{.underline}**. "Partly it comes from
a lack of understanding that, [even in the best-case scenario of 1.5°C
of global warming, which is where we are now, you still have such an
enormous amount of adaptation required,]{.underline}" continued Kelly.
"[People have felt they had to put everything into
mitigation]{.underline} -- which is extremely important, I don't want to
downplay that at all -- [but]{.underline} when Amanda and I conducted
our initial research on building a theory of change, we discovered
[there are adaptation solutions that are mitigation
friendly]{.underline}, and there are adaptation solutions that aren't
quite so mitigation friendly, and that is tough to acknowledge, because,
[in some areas, there's this view of a trade-off]{.underline}. So, for
example, air conditioning is quite energy intensive, but it is an
adaptation, so I think that's also part of the challenge for investors
who care about climate." O'Toole agreed, saying it requires a shift in
mindset from an investor's perspective when constructing a portfolio
universe. "I think anybody running an adaptation solutions fund would
also want to make sure they're not putting themselves in a position
where they are investing in companies that are to the detriment of
climate mitigation efforts. Some adaptation solutions won't fit within a
conventional sustainable investment universe, but, equally, [there's
still a huge need for solutions to protect from fire or coastal
flooding]{.underline}, for example, which makes it a difficult
conversation to start." With images of the LA wildfires broadcast widely
and bringing the threat of extreme weather events closer to home,
however, these conversations are beginning in earnest, added Kelly.
"Until now, [the effects of climate change were seen as a thing
happening in emerging markets]{.underline}, and it was the role of
Western nations to just reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. [But once
people are affected by that risk themselves, they're much more
incentivised to do something about it]{.underline}. The [LA fires have
highlighted]{.underline} this isn't just a problem for poor countries,
[it's a problem for everyone]{.underline}."

2021]{.mark}. The goal is to restrict global warming to 1.5°C by 2100,

adaptation means]{.mark} [deserting]{.mark} those [most
vulnerable]{.mark} to [and]{.mark} [least responsible]{.mark} [for
global warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. The IPCC recommends agroforestry as
a sustainable solution to addressing the challenge of climate change.
Beyond the climate crisis, agroforestry can address the issues of food
insecurity, malnutrition and biodiversity loss. Agroforestry in both
rural and urban settings is a powerful concept with popular appeal,
inspiring diverse people to imagine urban food systems on a wider scale
-- from homesteads to landscapes, from residential lots to vacant lots
to public green spaces. According to FAO (2022), of the 2.2 billion ha
of degraded land identified as potentially available for restoration
worldwide, 1.5 billion ha may be best suited for mosaic restoration,
combining forests and trees with agriculture. However, [[to
improve]{.mark} the adoption rates of agroforestry, and
[adaptation]{.mark} objectives, [incentives]{.mark} and strategic
investments [will be required]{.mark}]{.underline} for 3-8 years.
Effective adaptation requires more science, better data and bold
policies across multiple sectors, plus effective partnerships. Most
importantly there is a need for action on the ground.

1\. Introduction The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC)1 has stated unequivocally that human influence on the
climate system is clear: emissions of greenhouse gases from human
activity are the highest in history, and recent changes in the climate
have had a significant impact on human and natural systems across the
world. Climate change has already increased the intensity and frequency
of extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, heat-waves,
wildfires and cyclones, and has contributed to changing rainfall
patterns and rising sea levels. Such extremes and variability in the
climate harm people directly and have severe implications for
ecosystems, the world of work, health, livelihoods, food production,
infrastructure, settlements and other areas that are fundamental to
human well-being. A just transition,2 achieved by means of inclusive
mitigation measures aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, and
inclusive adaptation measures aimed at minimizing vulnerabilities to the
impacts of climate change, is thus crucial for building sustainable and
resilient societies. In this context, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development,3 the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction4 and the
Paris Agreement5 on climate change highlight the growing international
concern and commitment to addressing climate change and its social,
environmental and economic implications. [[Indigenous peoples
are]{.mark} among [the first to **experience** the]{.mark} direct
[impacts of **climate change**]{.mark}, even though they contribute
little to greenhouse-gas emissions]{.underline}.6 [They are also
directly affected by environmental destruction, which is a leading cause
of climate change, such as [**deforestation**, land degradation,
and]{.mark} [pollution from]{.mark} mining and oil and gas
**[extraction]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Climate change poses severe
threats to their livelihoods, cultures, identities and ways of life
because the majority of indigenous peoples have a close cultural
relationship with the environment, and are often dependent on land and
natural resources to meet their livelihood needs. [Climate change also
risks [enhanc]{.mark}ing their existing [socioeconomic
**vulnerabilities**]{.mark}. The IPCC has stressed that people who are
socially, economically, **culturally**, **politically**,
**institutionally**, or otherwise **marginalized** are especially
vulnerable to climate change and also to some **adaptation** and
mitigation responses]{.underline}.7 This finding is particularly
significant for indigenous peoples, as they continue to be among the
poorest sections of the society and face a range of social and economic
disadvantages. These include the lack of recognition and protection of
their human rights, including rights to land and to be consulted and to
participate in decision-making, and their resulting lack of involvement
in the formation of public policies. Insecurity over livelihoods, land
alienation, forced migration, loss of identity and culture,
discrimination and exploitation in the world of work, and limited access
to opportunities are additional key challenges. Indigenous women are
particularly vulnerable to multiple forms of discrimination and
exploitation from both within and outside their communities. They are
also increasingly forced to work in precarious working conditions where
they lack adequate access to social protection and are exposed to
gender-based violence. [[The combination of]{.mark} such [**social,
economic, political** and **environmental** issues]{.mark} faced by
indigenous **women** and **men** [places them in a unique position of
vulnerability]{.mark} to climate change, compared to other groups in
society, including the poor. Consequently, climate change and
[exclusionary]{.mark} **adaptation** and [mitigation responses pose a
**threat** to]{.mark} the [cultural diversity]{.mark} of the planet [and
risk **exacerbating**]{.mark} the **[impoverishment]{.mark}** of
indigenous people]{.underline}s.8 At the same time, however,
[[indigenous peoples are **crucial agents**]{.mark} of change because
their livelihood systems]{.underline}, occupations, traditional
knowledge and ways of life are essential for combating climate change
effectively.9 This [is particularly so [in the case of]{.mark}
**mitigation** efforts directed at **[reducing emissions]{.mark}** from
**deforestation** and forest **degradation**, fostering conservation,
[sustainable **management** of forests]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[enhancement of]{.mark} forest **[carbon stocks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(such as REDD+), [as well as the **[adaptation]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
agricultural practices [[to climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}. In such
contexts, capitalizing on indigenous peoples' comparative advantage when
it comes to combating climate change by securing their access to decent
work opportunities and promoting sustainable enterprises such as
cooperatives, and ensuring that indigenous peoples are not left behind,
are fundamental to attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) and building sustainable, inclusive and resilient societies.

### Recognition Good

#### Full Inuit recognition is crucial to decolonialize debating about who is the worst colonizer does nothing to help the material conditions of Inuit peoples. 

**Olsvig,** International Chair, INUIT CIRCUMPOLAR COUNCIL , **2/2/25**
(Sara, \"There Is No Such Thing as The Better Colonizer\",

What we want to debate

For almost five decades, Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) have paved the
way for Inuit of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka (Russia) to
work together.

In our endeavor for mutually respectful coexistence, ICC has garnered
the support of changing governments and heads of states, and we have
always cherished their cooperation and support. On the road ahead, we
call for a continued mutual respect for our differences and rights.

**[The progress towards decolonization can only occur by working in full
partnership with Inuit.]{.underline}**

**[We do not wish to debate which state is better or worse to live in or
is a better or worse colonizer. Rather we want to debate how we improve
Inuit lives, livelihoods, wellbeing, and self-determination across all
our regions.]{.underline}**

Not least, we welcome truthful focus and reflection on the inequities
Inuit continue to face through colonization. **[The progress towards
decolonization can only occur by working in full partnership with
Inuit.]{.underline}**

We make deals the Inuit way

**[Inuit have occupied our vast lands and seas across the Arctic for
millennia]{.underline}**, well before colonization, **[and we will be
here in the future. The Arctic is our traditional homeland, the
resources of the Arctic sustain our communities, and have done so for
time immemorial.]{.underline}**

For decades, we have exercised peaceful dialogues to increase our
self-determination, we have made good deals on trade and development.

Across our regions we have seen changing levels of military presence
over time, and we are acutely aware of the significance of our homelands
to geopolitical interests of many states.

We recognize and are acutely aware, that the current geopolitical
situation is challenging, but times have changed since Inuit lands were
mere commodities that could be bought and sold. In today's world, we are
active participants in decision-making about our lands and resources.

We are beyond the times of typical colonial attitudes of superiority.
**[The arrangements Inuit have negotiated with governments and states
are deals done the Inuit way, and we will continue to support each other
in each of our endeavors for greater freedom.]{.underline}**

### Tugend \-\-- Rejects Western Centrism

#### The aff is a crucial step towards embracing an ethic of relationality in the Arctic that rejects totalizing Western state-centrism while protecting local ecology. 

**Tugend 25** \[Mana Tugend is an LL.M. graduate in Polar Law from the
University of Akureyri, Iceland, and is currently pursuing a PhD at the
Norwegian Center for the Law of the Sea; 4/8/25; "The Arctic Ocean as

Addressing the Arctic's escalating socio-ecological crises requires
rethinking our normative relationship with the ocean at its core. A
[radical departure from the entrenched structures of traditional Western
tools informed by state-centrism is necessary]{.underline}, [moving
instead toward a relational approach rooted in care, reciprocity, and
mutual enhancement]{.underline}. This shift envisions the Arctic Ocean
not as a passive object of regulation but as an active agent in shaping
this relationship. [Drawing from Indigenous knowledge, relationality
scholarships, ethics of care and the profound interdependencies with
these fragile ecosystems, this article suggests a relational model that
challenges the Western legal tradition.]{.underline}

In many Indigenous worldviews, the ocean, among other natural entities,
is viewed not as separate from human life but as kin or sacred beings
that coexist in balance with human life. For instance, the Arctic Ocean
forms the essence of Inuit identity and livelihoods, deeply woven into
the fabric of their way of knowing and being.^13)^ It is central to
their existence, cultural identity as a people, economic stability, and
social well-being in all its forms, from liquid to frozen.^14)^ In this
context, embracing relationality becomes a shared collective
responsibility to care for the ocean's health and flourishing, which
cannot be separated from the flourishing of the human and the
more-than-human communities that depend on it.

A [relational ethic that resists the binary epistemological frameworks
and ontologies characteristics of Western modernity is essential to this
reimagined relationship]{.underline}.^15)^ [Legal initiatives based on
relational ethics move away from the state's all-encompassing
sovereignty]{.underline}, [embracing diverse]{.underline}
[actors]{.underline}, including Indigenous peoples, and even
conceptualizing nature, including the ocean itself, as an active
participant.^16)^ One notable example of relational legal framework is
Aotearoa New Zealand's recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal
person under the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act
2017.^17)^ This model goes beyond conventional Western legal paradigms
by incorporating Māori perspectives, which view the river as an ancestor
(*tupuna*) and emphasize its intrinsic value as part of a living system.
The Act established the Whanganui River as a legal person, with its
interests represented by a guardian (Te Pou Tupua) composed of two
people acting as one single entity: one appointed by the Whanganui iwi
(tribes/people) and one by the Crown. While this guardianship model
provides an innovative step toward relational laws, it still operates
within the constraints of human oversight and interpretation. The
guardians act as intermediaries between the river and human society,
upholding the river's intrinsic values, [safeguarding]{.underline} its
[ecological integrity]{.underline}, [preserving its biodiversity,
protecting its cultural heritage, and ensuring its overall
health]{.underline} and well-being. However, while inspired by
Indigenous relationality, such a model remains rooted in Western
anthropocentric legal traditions that frame nature through human
categories of rights and representation.

In this context, a [guardianship framework tailored to the Arctic could
offer a practical avenue for implementing relationality]{.underline},
[with representatives from Arctic Indigenous peoples and
communities]{.underline}, and state or regional authorities co-caring
for the Arctic Ocean. However, for this model to truly reflects
relational values it would [need to avoid the pitfalls of conventional
legal personhood by emphasizing care, reciprocity and the ocean's
agency]{.underline}, thereby recognizing the ocean not as a passive
entity to be managed but as a dynamic, self-regulating force with a
distinct voice in representative frameworks. The Arctic Ocean,
envisioned as a co-creator in the interdependent relationships that
sustain life, would take an active role in its own care, rather than
being subject to dominion-based paradigms. Drawing on Indigenous
worldviews that already view the ocean as kin or a sacred entity, this
expanded relational legal model would foster a connection to the Arctic
Ocean that [transcends utilitarianism, emphasizing mutual respect, care,
and enhancement]{.underline}. Such an approach also [addresses the
Arctic's unique challenges by respecting its interwoven ecological,
social, and cultural dimensions]{.underline}. Furthermore, it [situates
the Arctic Ocean as an integral part of a broader ecosystem where all
beings]{.underline}---human and more-than-human---[collaboratively shape
a shared future]{.underline}. This inclusive perspective honors
non-Western worldviews and ways of being, affirming the rights of all
beings to coexist harmoniously.

A relational legal model emphasizes the dynamic, interconnected, and
inclusive nature of ecological, social, and cultural systems,
[advocating for governance models that move beyond the constraints of
state-centrism]{.underline}.^18)^ [Dynamism enables legal frameworks to
adapt and evolve in response to the Arctic's rapidly changing social and
ecological landscapes]{.underline}, where rigid, static approaches are
insufficient. [Connectivity reflects the deep interdependence between
human and more-than-human entities in the Arctic]{.underline},
recognizing that the health and well-being of these systems are
inseparable. Relational laws also promote inclusivity, [ensuring that
diverse voices and knowledge systems, particularly those of Indigenous
peoples, are woven into governance structures, respecting the unique
relationships that local communities have with their
environments]{.underline}. By honoring place-based knowledge of Arctic
Indigenous peoples, [relational laws bridge the gap between Western
legal frameworks and Indigenous relational ethics, fostering a normative
relationship that is deeply rooted in local contexts]{.underline}. In
doing so, [they reject universalizing practices that flatten the
richness of specific places and natural systems]{.underline}. Chimamanda
Ngozi Adichie's notion of the "danger of a single story" underscores the
importance of embracing diverse perspectives and experiences to avoid
harmful simplifications and distorted understanding of reality.^19)^

In addition, a shift toward relational models [extends beyond legal
frameworks; it also requires cultivating emotional and cultural
connections]{.underline} with the ocean. Empathy, compassion, and
responsibility become the [drivers of environmental
caretaking]{.underline}, encouraging deeper and lasting behavioral
changes. Recognizing our emotional and moral responsibility to care for
the Arctic Ocean fosters a collective commitment to protecting it that
challenges the status quo.

Conclusion: Envisioning a Relational Community of Care

Rethinking the normative relationship with the Arctic Ocean calls for a
transformative vision of the region as a space of shared care, where
humans and the more-than-human collaborate to preserve their common
home. This vision aligns with the concept of "community of care," as
articulated by Emily Murray and Margherita Poto,^20)^ which emphasizes
mutual learning between humans and the ocean, and fosters caring as a
shared responsibility. Such a vision requires humankind to
think *with* the ocean, not merely about it as a resource, but as an
active participant in co-shaping its/our future.

It calls for relational and reciprocal legal models that acknowledges
the interconnectedness of human and more-than-human worlds and
recognizes the diverse experiences of the Arctic Ocean. It underscores
that there is no single story of the Arctic Ocean, but a multitude of
Arctic experiences, each shaped by local histories, ecologies, and
communities. A key step in this transformation is devolving authority to
communities and fostering place-based laws. By centering the voices and
knowledge of those most connected to the Arctic, including Indigenous
peoples and local communities, we can move toward legal systems that are
as diverse and dynamic as the ecosystems they aim to protect. This
[localized approach ensures that laws reflect the unique characteristics
and needs of each Arctic context, rather than imposing homogenizing
frameworks]{.underline}.

While the [rights offer a meaningful starting point by acknowledging the
intrinsic value of natural entities]{.underline}, they remain grounded
in Western legal paradigms that risk reinforcing human authority over
nature. It is unsure whether they are sufficient to pave the way for a
legal model that transcends state-dominated structures. These rights
could [serve as a transitional tool in this journey towards a deeper
transformation that prioritizes relational and reciprocal ethics and
systems over rigid legal mechanisms]{.underline}. A relational and
inclusive model unlocks new pathways for the future of the Arctic Ocean.
Rooted in respect, reciprocity, and care for the ocean and for each
other. By cultivating a community of care, we honor the Arctic Ocean as
an integral part of the web of life, ensuring its health and well-being
alongside the flourishing of human and more-than-human communities.

### Perm \-\-- Co-operation is key

#### The plan is an instance of cooperation without submission---that [preserves]{.underline} Native sovereignty, [but]{.underline} the uncertainty in the [CP]{.underline} means the state will [say no]{.underline} or implement shallow, failed policy that doesn't benefit Native communities. 

**Richland 21** \[Justin B. Richland is associate justice of the Hopi
Appellate Court as well as associate professor of anthropology at the
University of California, Irvine; "Cooperation without Submission";
9/6/21; Part 1: Cooperation without Submission Pg. 3-5\]//ONHS AMo

The invisibility of these events has meant that most [Native Nation--US
engagements are rarely understood as sites for the enactment of Tribal
sovereignty, Tribal governance, and/or resistance to settler colonial
impositions]{.underline}. Moreover, [what might count as expressions of
Tribal self-determination in these contexts often looks different from
how they appear in moments of more spectacular
confrontation]{.underline}. Instead of raised fists and body blockades,
[enacting self-determination in these quiet contexts involves a subtle
but determined insistence by Tribal advocates on the enduring viability
of their People's interests and the norms, knowledge, and relations that
constitute them]{.underline}. This insistence is often the [impetus
behind Tribal representatives' willingness to engage US officials in the
first place]{.underline}. And it is a [ground they do not cede, even
when non-Natives misunderstand their reasons for engaging or when the
outcomes of their engagement fall short of their Tribes'
goals.]{.underline}

I call this commitment "[cooperation without submission]{.underline},"
which is based on what my mentor, Hopi linguist, lawyer, and
anthropologist Emory Sekaquaptewa, once said about his People's
principles of sociocultural and political order. At first glance, the
phrase seems to express a simple contradiction. How can there be
"cooperation" between two or more political agents without each yielding
some aspect of their respective autonomy? Further reflection only yields
more complexity, for "cooperation" offered up without autonomy is not
cooperation at all; it is coercion. At this point, the phrase not only
starts to sound tautological but also bears a striking resemblance to
some of the classic themes of Euro-American political liberalism, the
stuff of sovereignty and social contract theory deliberated by Hobbes,
Locke, Rousseau, and their followers and critics.

But Sekaquaptewa insisted that he learned this lesson elsewhere. He
argued that his view is based on the teachings he received about the
coordination accomplished by the clans and ceremonial societies that
constitute Hopi society, and particularly how they come together for
Hopi Peoples' mutual benefit and ongoing well-being. Of particular
import is that this coordination is [conditioned on the mutual respect
for each clan's particular norms, knowledge, and relations]{.underline}
(what they call navoti, traditional sacred knowledge or knowledge gained
through hearing) and the strict prohibitions against sharing that navoti
with anyone not a member of that clan or not initiated in its ceremonial
societies. It is this [commitment to decentralized social power and
authority]{.underline}---to the notion that each Hopi clan has its own
ways of valuing, knowing, and relating to the world---[that cannot not
be challenged by the other clans that have thrown in their lot
together]{.underline}. It is the ongoing relations of respect for each
partner clan's authority and the vigilance against imposing the norms
and knowledge of one on any other that constitutes the glue holding Hopi
society together rather than pulling it apart (Ishii 2001; Sekaquaptewa
1972).

It is my argument in this book that, although he never claimed it,
Sekaquaptewa's theory both suggests an abiding principle of Hopi
sociality and characterizes an impetus that Hopi---and indeed many other
Tribal Nations--- rely on when engaging their non-Native counterparts in
US federal agencies and other settler colonial organizations and
institutions: many Native Nations have a similarly distributed,
decentralized theory of sociopolitical authority and practices of
self-governance. This, coupled with their shared experience of centuries
of Euro-American settler colonialism---which invariably makes them
unrecognizable and erases their sovereignty and authority even when
claiming to work for their benefit---is why I argue that Sekaquaptewa
was speaking about a Hopi theory of sociopolitical order and engagement
that has resonances with the experiences and commitments of other Native
Nations' engagements with the United States.

I believe that cooperation without submission (hereafter, CWS) can be
[understood as an Indigenous theory of jurisdiction]{.underline}. It
describes an actively accomplished sphere of authority that Indigenous
leaders (and advocates for Native Nations) invoke and enact as
expressions of their ongoing sovereignty in the practices of their
everyday self-governance. It is a jurisdiction entailed and produced in
the details of the legal language---juris-diction (literally
lawtalk)---that Native Nation leaders and representatives deploy when
undertaking the government-to-government relationship with the US
settler state. I argue that [US agencies and organizations have long
passed laws and policies that claim an interest in Indigenous norms,
knowledge, and relations. More often than not, however, they treat
Indigenous lifeways as objects to be inquired about, evaluated, and made
meaningful according to US regulatory and scientific
criteria]{.underline}. Ironically, [they do not see them as the
foundational and constitutive elements of Indigenous everyday practices
of self-determination]{.underline}, or of that which is accomplished
through Indigenous juris-dictions of CWS. The [results are therefore all
too predictable]{.underline}. That is, [US agents and agencies
continuously make unrecognizable the reasons Native leaders and
advocates engage with them in the first place, and constantly
misdiagnose why federal laws and policies fail Tribal Nations more
generally. This has been true since the first relations with Native
Nations.]{.underline}

### Lightfoot \-\-- Pessimism Trap

In a similar vein, [Coulthard's [central]{.mark}
[argument]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} centered on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now works through
the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping their perspectives
in line with state discourses, rather than merely excluding them, as in
years past. Therefore, [[any]{.mark} [attempt]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[seek]{.mark} 'the [reconciliation]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[Indigenous]{.mark} nationhood [with]{.mark} [state]{.mark} sovereignty
[is]{.mark} still [colonial]{.mark} insofar as it remains structurally
committed to the dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and
self-determining authority'.30]{.underline}

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states first
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has [[concluded]{.mark} that
[states]{.mark} are [deliberate]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [never]{.mark}
[changing]{.mark} in their behaviour.]{.underline} With
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} move, Corntassel [[limits]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} actually [demeans]{.mark} [Indigenous]{.mark}
[agency]{.mark}, overlooking the reality that [Indigenous]{.mark}
[organisations]{.mark} themselves [chose]{.mark} the human rights
framework and [rights]{.mark} [discourse]{.mark} as a target sphere of
action precisely [because]{.mark}, as was evident in earlier struggles
like slavery, civil rights or women's rights, [these]{.mark}
[were]{.mark} [tools]{.mark} available to them [that had a
proven]{.mark} [track record]{.mark} [of]{.mark} opening up [new
possibilities]{.mark} and shifting previous state positions and
behaviour]{.underline}. [Indigenous advocates]{.underline} also cleverly
[[realised]{.underline}]{.mark}, by the 1970s, that the
[[**anti-discrimination** and **decolonisation**]{.mark} [frames]{.mark}
could be [used]{.mark} together [against states]{.mark}.]{.underline}
States did, in no way, nefariously impose a rights framework on
Indigenous peoples. Rather, [Indigenous organisations and savvy
Indigenous political actors deliberately chose to frame their
self-determination struggles]{.underline} [within the human rights
framework in order to bring states into a double bind where they could
not credibly claim to adhere to human rights and claim that they uphold
equality while simultaneously denying Indigenous peoples' human rights
and leaving them with a diminished and unequal right of
self-determination]{.underline}. But, because he is caught in [the
[pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline} [[trap]{.underline}]{.mark} of seeing
the state only as unifed, deliberate and unchanging, Corntassel
overlooks and [[diminishes]{.mark} the clear story of Indigenous agency
and the potential for positive change in advancing
[self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline} in a multitude of ways.

[Pessimism Trap]{.underline} 3: [Engagement with the Settler State is
Futile, if Not Counter-Productive]{.underline}

Since the state always intends to maintain, if not expand, colonial
control, and is seeking to co-opt as many Indigenous peoples as possible
in order to maintain or expand its dispossession and control, it is
therefore futile, at best, and actually dangerous to Indigenous
existence to engage with the state. Furthermore, all patterns of
engagement will lead to co-optation as the state is cunning and
unrelenting in its desire to co-opt Indigenous leaders, academics and
professionals in order to gain or maintain control of Indigenous
peoples.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and 'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating'.32 Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's
insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34
Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame
their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but
do so within a state framework, rather than resisting the state itself,
it 'represents the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate
indigenous peoples'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position that
calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to "turn away" from the
assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
"traditional" political values and practices'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, fve theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1.  On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
    Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very
    important not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of
    protecting the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples'
    existence;

2.  Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
    economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of
    land-based Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3.  Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the
    need for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the
    interrelated systems of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples'
    experiences in both urban and land-based settings'38;

4.  Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
    also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
    relations that are non-violent and refective of the centrality of
    women in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5.  Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
    complete rejection of engagement with the state's political and
    legal system, he does assert that 'our efforts to engage these
    discursive and institutional spaces to secure recognition of our
    rights have not only failed, but have instead served to subtly
    reproduce the forms of racist, sexist, economic, and political
    confgurations of power that we initially sought...to challenge'.39
    He therefore advocates expressly for 'critical self-refection,
    skepticism, and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of recognition
    that seeks to practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and
    economically nonexploitative alternative structures of law and
    sovereign authority grounded on a critical refashioning of the best
    of Indigenous legal and political traditions'.40

### Turner \-\-- Survival Strategy

#### Rhetorical engagement in civil society is a survival strategy for Natives and is key to hold settlers accountable -- this does not preclude Decolonization.

**Turner, 2006** Dale Antony. Associate Professor of Government and
Native American Studies at Dartmouth - [This is not a peace pipe:
Towards a critical indigenous philosophy.]{.underline} University of
Toronto Press, 2006.

[The issue of participation generates epistemological problems of
reconciling indigenous forms of knowledge with Western European
philosophy]{.underline}. It also generates practical problems: How are
indigenous voices to be accommodated in the legal and political
discourses of the state? I contend that [the intellectual work required
to bring (or force) indigenous voices into the dominant intellectual
community is the responsibility of a group of indigenous intellectuals
called \'word warriors.[\']{.mark} **[Word warriors reconcile the forms
of knowledge rooted in indigenous communities with the legal and
political discourses of the state]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[They do this
for two reasons. First, **our survival as indigenous peoples demands**
**that in order** **to** assert and **protect the rights** we believe
**we possess, we must engage the discourses of the state more
effectively**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[Second, indigenous knowledge
offers legitimate ways of understanding the world]{.underline}]{.mark} -
ways [[that have never been respected within the legal and political
practices of the dominant culture.]{.underline}]{.mark} To make matters
worse, **[[these ways have not played a significant
role]{.underline}]{.mark}** (except in the early treaties) [**[in
determining the normative language of the political
relationship]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Word warriors do the intellectual
work of protecting indigenous ways of knowing; at the same time, they
empower these understandings within the legal and political practices of
the state. [Word warriors listen to their \'indigenous philosophers\'
while engaging the intellectual and political practices of the dominant
culture]{.underline}. 9

#### **The aff acts as a mediator between civil society and anti-state politics -- 2 impacts to this** (1) It's a survival strategy (2) It creates change through knowledge about problems in civil society.

**Turner, 2006** Dale Antony. Associate Professor of Government and
Native American Studies at Dartmouth - [This is not a peace pipe:
Towards a critical indigenous philosophy.]{.underline} University of
Toronto Press, 2006.

This is where Tully\'s notion of a mediator is helpful. [[He is offering
a way for philosophers]{.mark}, especially political philosophers, [to
see their own field of study in a way that]{.mark} includes - indeed,
even [demands]{.mark} -[Aboriginal participation]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[But [his mediator necessarily engages an Aboriginal mediator. An
Aboriginal mediator - a word warrior - is an indigenous person who
engages the imposed legal and political discourses of the state guided
by the belief that the knowledge and skills to be gained by engaging in
such discourses are necessary for the survival of all indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. Tully\'s mediator and the indigenous word
warrior both inhabit a social space that is difficult to define.
Indigenous intellectuals must be citizens of an indigenous community,
but how they will manage to move between languages, between ways of
thinking about the world, remains to be determined in practice.
[[Clearly]{.mark}, though, [word]{.mark} [warriors will have to assert
and protect those ways of knowing the world that define indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This may well be a difficult task in a
sometimes hostile world, but it is what we will need to do]{.mark}.
Perhaps Edward Said\' s idea of an intellectual as an exile is useful
here: [\'the exilic intellectual does not respond to the logic of the
conventional but to the audacity of daring, and to representing change,
to moving]{.mark} on, [not standing still]{.mark}]{.underline}.\' [Later
on he adds: [\'Nothing in my view is more reprehensible than those
habits of mind in the intellectual that induce avoidance, that
characteristic turning away from a difficult and principled position
which you know to be the right one, but which you decide not to
take]{.mark}]{.underline}.\'65

### 2AC Inuit Defense

#### The term "Inuit" is [uniquely key]{.underline} to effective and scientific discussion of indigenous groups, culturally appropriate, and holistic.

Throughout this book, I refer to the people living in what is today the
western edge of the North American Arctic. I use first and last names
wherever possible. [Since the [historical record]{.mark} usually [lumps
northerners into broad categories]{.mark}, I have made choices about
terminology]{.underline}. Since the indigenous rights and
self-determination movements of the 1960s, Inuit in this region have
referred to themselves with specific terms. "Inupiat" refers to the
Inuit of Arctic Alaska affiliated with the seven villages of the North
Slope Borough, the eleven villages of the Northwest Arctic Borough, and
the sixteen villages of the Bering Straits Regional Corporation.
"Inuvialuit" refers to the Inuit of the western Canadian Arctic
affiliated with the six villages in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. I
use these terms when describing historical events from the 1960s onward.
I sometimes add place names, such as "Inuvialuit residents of Inuvik" or
"Inupiat of Point Hope." [When alluding to all indigenous peoples of
Alaska, including various [Inuit]{.mark} and Northern Athabaskan
communities, I use the [term]{.mark} "Alaska Natives."]{.underline} For
episodes before 1960, [I have chosen to [identify indigenous communities
with labels that are **similarly historically specific, geographically
precise, and culturally appropriate.**]{.mark}]{.underline} For example,
when discussing Aboriginal peoples who engaged commercial whalers near
Herschel Island in the early 1900s, I may use the term "Inuit in the
Beaufort Sea region." I prefer this name over "Canadian Inuit," since
Inuit did not yet consider themselves Canadian and because these Inuit
were not only living in what was then Canada. I deliberately avoid
"Eskimo" in any case, because it is considered derogatory in Canada
(even though it is accepted in Alaska). [Above all, [such naming
conventions respect the principle that human relationships with the
northern environment shifted over time.]{.mark}]{.underline} I would
violate this principle by always employing "Inuvialuit" or "Inupiat" to
refer to the Inuit of this corner of the continent. [Inuit is also a
curiously plural term. It can stand with or without "the" as a modifier.
One hardly ever sees or hears "the Inuits," at least in the places I
have traveled for this research. If I refer to more than one Inuit
person or more than one Inuit community, or Inuit communities from more
than one political territory, I typically use
"**[Inuit]{.mark}**."]{.underline} The singular and adjectival version
is "Inuk" (or "Inuvialuk" or "Inupiaq"). [One of the tradeoffs of my
decisions on [terminology]{.mark} is the litany of names that may be
unfamiliar to the average reader. In coming to terms with these, I hope
the reader also [gathers **a more sophisticated understanding of people
and place**]{.mark}---­ [and the rich relationships between
them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC Stuhl Defense 

#### Stuhl is a researcher who has spent his time with indigenous communities in the Arctic and is advocating for an experience he directly enacts.

[[Indigenous perspectives]{.mark} like Cournoyea's [are crucial to
understanding today's Arctic, because they disrupt commonly accepted
notions]{.mark} of the region and implicate southerners in northern
affairs beyond the fossil fuels they burn. [Indigenous perspectives have
not been well recorded by]{.mark} the pens of [academic history]{.mark},
though.15 [For this reason, I have conducted research]{.mark} not only
in archives across the southern United States and Canada, but **[in the
Arctic]{.mark}** as well. [I spent twenty months living in Inuvik, a
town in the Mackenzie Delta of Canada's Northwest
Territories.]{.mark}]{.underline} I confess that my research in the
field was not part of a grand plan hatched at my desk and then carried
out in orderly fashion. I began by moving to Inuvik in the fall of 2007
as a community volunteer, with hopes of learning from residents about
the impacts of climate change in the Arctic. [[I spoke with public
figures, including scientists with local offices of federal agencies and
representatives of municipal, territorial, and Inuvialuit
governments.]{.mark}]{.underline} I heard many times that, while warming
temperatures have altered physical conditions in the Mackenzie Delta, an
understanding of climate change should be nested in the story of Arctic
science and colonialism. My interests piqued, I left for graduate school
in 2008 to craft a more in-­ depth study. [I returned to Inuvik two years
later with a commitment to the kinds of community engagement recommended
by environmental historians, historians of colonial science, public
scholars, and the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation.16 [I attended town
hall meetings and joined consultation sessions]{.mark} between oil
companies and hunters and trappers committees.]{.underline} I sat in on
northern studies classes at the high school. I pored over printed
materials and audio recordings at local libraries, the Inuvialuit
Cultural Resource Center, and the environmental agencies of the
Inuvialuit and federal governments. I spent time on the land with
Inuvialuit, soaking up stories of reindeer and trapping and hunting.
[When I found information about science's history in the Arctic[, I
shared]{.mark} it [through formal presentations]{.mark}---­ to both town
organizations and classrooms of high school students---­ and in- formal
discussions with individual residents.]{.underline} I helped organize a
five-­ day field trip that brought together scientists, Inuvialuit
elders, and high schoolers to explore the culture, ecology, and history
in Ivvavik National Park, on the border of Alaska and the Yukon
Territory. Although I spent the majority of my time in Canada, I also
traveled in Arctic Alaska. [[I completed a summer field course at the
University of Alaska--­ Fairbanks,]{.mark}]{.underline} through which I
visited North America's largest oil field in Prudhoe Bay and listened to
residents of Anaktuvuk Pass talk about the historical nature of
environmental challenges. Only when I headed south again in 2011 did I
find that many of these practices accorded with the insights of
postcolonial scholars, historical geographers, and Arctic
anthropologists.17 Let me be clear: [[I do not wish to speak for
Inuit]{.mark}.]{.underline} Inuvialuit and Inupiat speak on science,
colonialism, and environmental change regularly, and have for some
time.18 My short stay in northern North America also did not yield
complete and objective information. My personal background shaded my
experiences, even as acquaintances, friends, mentors, and research
participants helped me see different perspectives on the Arctic. I am
aware that Inuit society transcends Inuit relations with scientists.
Inuit have many more ideas about the Arctic than I present in these
pages. I do not pretend to know these, or intend to discount them.
Rather[, [I want to draw into bright context the ways scientific
practices have configured life in the north]{.mark}---­ and vice versa.
[This history of science and colonialism in the Arctic cannot be fully
told without learning from Inuit voices]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Interviews, casual conversations, unpublished materials, and even
silences in the historical record helped me apprehend the colonial
nature of science, both then and now. Indeed, by confining studies to
non-­ Native actors or neglecting indigenous accounts, historians
contribute to amnesia about colonialism in the north and overlook the
resilience of northern peoples and environments.
