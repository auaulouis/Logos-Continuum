# Notes

#### The 1ac is really long!

Save time by:

1.  Reducing highlighting. It's over-highlighted, deliberately. The best
    2ac will read few cards on the case, and this is highlighted to show
    all of the arguments you might need. Every card has a purpose, but
    you need to discern that purpose and how you'll use it to answer
    negative arguments.

2.  Cut scenarios. The permafrost disease scenario has ok cards but it's
    pretty dumb. The science diplomacy impacts that are global in nature
    obviously serve an important purpose, but it's less important than
    the other scenarios.

#### Topicality -- "its"

This is a somewhat threatening argument, and has two possible forms:

1.  "its" means the exploration has to be conducted by government
    employees, not private scientists under government contract. In the
    past, this type of topicality argument was pretty effective against
    an aff like this, primarily because the affirmative
    counter-interpretation was always "its = associated with", which is
    amorphous and very unlimiting. Here, the counterinterpretation is
    "its = federally controlled" which is a more reasonable limit, and
    consistent with how federally-conducted science or development works
    (the federal government has no real direct role in exploration or
    development other than US Geological Surveys and the Army Corps of
    Engineers)

2.  "its" means it has to be exclusively the federal government, which
    precludes cooperation. While this argument is threatening, a lot of
    the aff push should really be "we meet". You should say the
    affirmative uses an existing cooperation mechanism to send
    federally-contracted scientists to Russia. It doesn't fiat
    cooperation -- instead it provides funding for the US side of
    scientific missions to the Russian Arctic.

#### Russia DA

The most threatening part of this argument is the turns the case work.
2ac/1ar needs to leverage 1ac warrants to respond. There is new evidence
that helps, but it's still really important to learn the 1ac and write
blocks based on it.

#### Track 2 CP

I think this is questionably competitive, but the solvency deficits in
the 2ac are good. I wasn't able to find extensions for anything other
than the permutation, but I still think a well-explained 2ar of the 2ac
evidence should be able to win a solvency deficit.

Irina Panyushkina is a dendrochronologist --- a scientist who studies
tree-ring dating to understand past environmental conditions --- at the
University of Arizona. In early 2022 she was planning to do summer
fieldwork in Siberia, for her research on the links between climate
change, Russia's freshwater systems and Arctic ice formation. Her work
had already been delayed years by Covid-19.

Then Russia invaded Ukraine, and it slammed to a halt again.

Dmitry [Nicolsky, a geophysicist at the University of
Alaska]{.underline} at Fairbanks [who researches thawing Arctic
permafrost, managed to stay in touch with some of his Russia-based
colleagues as the war started to unfold. But over time that contact
stopped, and with it key information-sharing]{.underline}.

Florian Stammler, an anthropologist at the University of Lapland in
Finland, was unable after the invasion to return to Russia's Sakha
republic in northeastern Siberia, where he'd long been measuring the
impact of global warming on the nomadic, reindeer-herding Nenets people.

These projects represent a small fraction of the Arctic climate research
that's been derailed by the war in Ukraine. Studying the fast-warming
top of the planet is crucial to efforts to mitigate global warming and
understand its dynamics at lower latitudes. Arctic climate scientists
tend to be a close-knit community, as normal professional rivalries are
flattened by the borderless, existential threat of climate change.

But the war upended that status quo: Now geopolitics are a main
determinant of whether scientific projects can move forward.

Most EU and [NATO]{.underline} member [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}
have suspended or [[sharply limited funding for scholarly work involving
Russia]{.mark},]{.underline} a country that holds roughly half of the
world's Arctic territory. [[Sharing data is]{.underline}]{.mark} largely
[[banned and the limited communication]{.mark} [that's still
possible]{.mark} is nerve-wracking]{.underline}, [as former scientific
colleagues worry about [jeopardiz]{.mark}ing each others'
[careers]{.mark} or safety.]{.underline}

Finding ways to restart stalled science will be a recurring topic of
conversation at a major Arctic conference in Iceland this week, where
for the second year in a row, Russian scientists will not be present.

Asia will play an increasingly pivotal role in the Arctic, having
heavily invested in polar science capabilities in recent years, said
Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, former president of Iceland and the conference's
chairperson, in an interview on the eve of the gathering. "Japan, Korea
and China have modernized their research vessels with ice capability
more than any other country in the world in the last five to 10 years,"
Grimsson said.

A fundamental question for delegates to consider is whether "meaningful
Arctic science" and "meaningful global climate science" can be done at
all without access to data from Russia's Arctic, Grímsson said.

[Nicolsky's research on permafrost has been supported by [the National
Science Foundation]{.mark}]{.underline} (NSF), [one of the major
American bodies that [stopped funding new projects involving
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} under White House guidelines. [**The NSF
also pulled out of** most existing projects]{.underline}, unless they
could be adjusted to focus on non-Russian parts of the region. (A
European Commission decision had a similar impact on European funding.)

[[The project involved]{.mark} collecting [temperature readings
from]{.mark} more than [250 permafrost monitoring sites in
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, Alaska and Canada, and mapping key changes.
Arctic permafrost is estimated to hold 1,700 billion metric tons of
frozen and thawing organic carbon, at least twice what's already in the
Earth's atmosphere. As it thaws, that gas is released, accelerating
warming, which in turn speeds up thawing in a dangerous cycle.

[[Most of the planet's permafrost lies within
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and Nicolsky was relying on Russian
colleagues to collect that data. "We cannot remove this piece from the
equation," he says. "[[It's like **removing a couple of wheels from a
car and trying to drive it home**]{.underline}."]{.mark}

He's spent hours poring over legal documents, trying to find a clear
path to continue working together. [While the NSF did not withdraw
funding, Nicolsky's collaborators in Russia are unsure whether it's safe
to accept it, or even to communicate with US-based
scientists]{.underline}.

Last year he was still able to receive some data out of Russia, "but
this year it was just gridlock," he says. "I spent countless meetings
trying to facilitate collaboration with our Russian colleagues, to find
different means, and it was falling apart from both ends, on the Russian
side and on the US side."

A fractured Arctic Council

It's not just communication breakdowns. Nicolsky adds that [[the
logistics system underpinning Arctic research --- helping scientists
ship equipment across borders and facilitating visas --- is]{.mark}
fundamentally ["broken]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

Much of that kind of support had been provided by the Arctic Council, a
pan-governmental group of Arctic nations formed in 1996 that includes
Russia. A week after the invasion of Ukraine, it suspended all
activities.

The Council had been a critically important body for bringing states and
Indigenous groups together on Arctic issues, leading to legally binding
agreements on matters such as scientific cooperation, search and rescue
operations and marine pollution. Prior to the war in Ukraine, a Council
working group was studying a possible pan-Arctic agreement to fight and
prevent wildfires, of the kind that tore through Siberia and Canada in
recent years.

That and other work has gradually resumed, though not at the normal
speed or level, says Morten Hoglund, the Norwegian chair of the Council.
Since his country assumed the rotating position from Russia in May,
Hoglund has worked to find a way to unstick the body, which operates by
consensus. A decision in August to allow member countries to communicate
in writing, without having to meet, is an important step toward easing
logjams and eventually allowing a few key projects to move forward.
Still, the Council is not yet in a position to approve new projects, and
even if they were, "there are layers of challenges, not only political
but also practical," that discourage collaboration with Russia, he says.
"We have to be realistic."

[[Progress will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[depend]{.mark} more [on
the willingness of]{.mark} the Council's Western [nations to
engage]{.mark} with [Russia]{.mark} than the other way
around,]{.underline} says Jennifer Spence, a public policy expert with
Harvard University's Arctic Initiative. "[[It **wasn't Russia blocking
anything**,]{.mark} it was the]{.underline} seven [other]{.underline}
like-minded [state]{.underline}s," she says of the Council's paralysis.
"In many ways, [[Russia has been ready to come to the table from day
one]{.mark} and been pretty open about the fact that they wanted the
Arctic Council to continue to function]{.underline}."

#### Cutting off Russian data on permafrost [biases]{.underline} climate models and make it [impossible]{.underline} to adapt or mitigate

Malte **Humpert,** 20**24** -- journalist. 'Lack of Russian data reduces
understanding of climate change in the Arctic', High North News, 2 Feb.

//DH

[[A new study]{.mark}]{.underline} published in the science journal
Nature [sheds new light on how Russia's invasion of Ukraine hampers the
collection of scientific data across the Arctic. The researchers [looked
at the world's largest network of high-latitude research
stations]{.mark}]{.underline}, called the International Network for
Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic (INTERACT), [[to
determine what biases are introduced into the system when Russian data
is excluded]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[The impact of lacking Russian data over the past 24 months is
especially significant as [the country accounts for the majority of
Arctic landmass]{.mark}]{.underline} and more than half of the Arctic
Ocean's coastline.

The scientists concluded that [some [biases are **so
significant**]{.mark} that [it will be hard to distinguish between
shifts caused by climate change and those caused by the exclusion of
Russian data]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[With parts of the Arctic warming at four times the rate]{.mark} as the
rest of the planet, the collection and assembly of
**[ground-based]{.mark}** [observations]{.mark} across the region [forms
a key tool to assessing how the Arctic's climate state is
changing]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Now data is]{.mark}
predominantly [coming from **non-Russian**]{.mark}]{.underline} parts of
the [[Arctic.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The new study aims to determine how impactful the lack of Russian data
is on the overall results. To quantify the effort the researchers looked
at eight key variables, including annual mean air temperature, total
precipitation, snow depth, soil moisture, vegetation biomass, soil
carbon, net primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration.

The data comes from a network of 60 stations located above 59° N, of
which 17 stations are located in Russia.

The researchers emphasized that even with all Russian stations included
the network's data contains a certain bias as the stations are
"generally located in the slightly warmer and wetter parts of the
Arctic" and in areas which generally experience deeper snowpacks and are
thus not fully representative of the pan-Arctic ecosystem.

However, [the loss of the Russian stations further erodes the
representativeness across almost all ecosystem variables]{.underline}.
This is especially true for Russia's extensive taiga forests across
Siberia, which are now fully excluded from the data set.

A dangerous blind spot

[The researchers warn]{.underline} that [[this]{.underline}]{.mark}
blind spot [[will **severely hamper** the tracking of the global
implications of thawing permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark} across vast
swaths of Russian Arctic lands.

[[Permafrost has been called a "**ticking time bomb**]{.mark} below our
feet," as it holds vast stores of CO₂ and methane]{.underline}, two
powerful greenhouse gasses. [As the soil warms it also has a detrimental
effect on Arctic infrastructure.]{.underline}

The findings suggest that the variability and bias introduced by
excluding the Russian stations is "of a similar magnitude as the shifts
inflicted by almost 80 years of projected climate change." [It
will]{.underline} thus [be challenging to understand what shifts were
the result of climate change and which are introduced by the lack of
data.]{.underline}

The study concludes that "because of the geopolitical consequences of
the Russian attack on Ukraine, the ability to both track and further
project the development of the Arctic biome following climate-induced
ecosystem change has deteriorated."

[[This]{.mark} lack of understanding]{.underline} in turn [**[will
reduce the ability to design initiatives to]{.mark}** help
**[mitigate]{.mark}** some of the negative consequences of climate
**[change]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} will [reduce the
effectiveness of]{.mark} already **[existing
programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The researchers call on the international community to "strive for
establishing and improving a research infrastructure and standardized
monitoring programmes representative of the entire Arctic."

They conclude that "until that is implemented, the ability to support
and advise local and global communities will decrease further due to the
loss of Russian stations representing half of the Arctic's landmass."

#### Permafrost thaw creates [positive feedbacks]{.underline} that cause [runaway]{.underline} warming

Over the past four decades, the issue of climate change has just grown
to encompass interconnected and systemic pressure that exert systemic
pressures on human societies (Bauer, 2011; Ripple et al., 2023). From
freshwater scarcity to extreme weather events, the current shift in the
Earth's climate regime indicates that we are entering a period of
instability as the Holocene equilibrium is no longer consistent due to
long-standing anthropogenic perturbations (Lawrence et al., 2024).
Therefore, climate change is transforming from a scientific concern to a
global security issue that must be addressed on an institutional,
ethical, and legal basis (Goldstein, 2016). As we move out of a
relatively stable planetary regime, our primary concern as a collective
species is to anticipate and predict the outcome of these changes and
their magnitude. In other words, what seems extreme now may well become
the normality of the planet of tomorrow. In this context, [[the
cryosphere]{.underline}]{.mark} -- consisting of Earth's ice sheets, sea
ice, permafrost, polar oceans, glaciers, and snow -- [[is "ground zero
for climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}" (ICCI, 2023). [Its systemic
destabilization as a result of continued global temperature rise
indicates a dire vulnerability to climate regime
disruption.]{.underline}

Over the course of the last five decades, [[the Arctic region has
warmed]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [[four times faster than the global
average]{.mark} rate]{.underline} underlining the rapid change in the
polar area, a phenomenon called Arctic amplification (Drüke et al.,
2024). As such, [[the polar region]{.mark} has a specific centrality in
the global climate system as it [is home of several key tipping
points]{.mark}]{.underline} (Armstrong McKay et al., 2022; Hansen et
al., 2016; Lenton, 2012; Lenton et al., 2019). As defined by Rahmstorf
(2024), [a tipping point is "a point]{.underline} at [which]{.underline}
further development into a fundamentally different state [becomes an
unstoppable self-sustained process, driven by reinforcing feedback
effects]{.underline}". To sum up, [the influence of [the polar region is
so critical that it may tilt the Earth's climate
regime]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among the tipping points identified[,
[permafrost thaw is]{.mark} of particular concern because of its
potential for]{.underline} adverse local impacts and its role as [[a
catalyst for broader, long-term feedbacks]{.underline}]{.mark} (Nitzbon
et al., 2024). Given its potential role in the ongoing climate crisis
and the formation of positive feedback loops, permafrost thawing is a
strategic issue for the international community. Within this paradigm,
the scientific community plays an instrumental role in implementing a
new international security regime by acting as an operational
stakeholder in the monitoring and analysis of the biophysical dynamics
in the polar region.

3.1. The case of permafrost

Due to the rapid anthropogenic climate change, [one of the major threats
to the stability of the Earth's climate regime is related to the thawing
permafrost]{.underline}. Permafrost covers ∼25% of the land surface of
the Northern Hemisphere, partly mapped in the Arctic (i.e., 13--18
million km2). In total, the permafrost stores an estimated 1100--1500
billion metric tons of soil organic carbon, which upon thaw can be
decomposed into carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide
(N2O) -- all of them greenhouse gases (GHG) (Hugelius et al., 2014). In
scientific terms, permafrost is defined by the temperature at which the
ground remains at or below 0 C degree for at least two consecutive
years. As Westerveld et al. (2023) remind us, "as long as permafrost
stays frozen, the organic carbon within it will remain locked in the
ground". However, [[an accelerating warming climate threatens to release
this stored carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} (C) [[massively into the
atmosphere]{.mark} through widespread microbial
decomposition]{.underline}. While the Arctic permafrost soils are among
the largest reservoirs on Earth, [the]{.underline} long-term [risk lies
in the possibility that [the polar region could become a]{.mark} C pool
[source -- rather]{.mark} than of a C [sink -- resulting in a positive
climate feedback mechanism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} known as the
permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) (Miner et al., 2022; Schuur et al.,
2015; See et al., 2024). With respect to the Arctic tundra, [conversion
to a C pool source may already be occurring, signaling a shift in the
permafrost regime]{.underline} (Natali et al., 2024). In recent decades,
changes in the thickness of the active layer of permafrost (i.e., the
seasonally unfrozen surface layer) have been observed, suggesting that
the current rate of thawing is faster than predicted by models (Turetsky
et al., 2019; Westerveld et al., 2023). Projections of continued
temperature increase under IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs,
replacing RCP scenarios) indicate further warming of permafrost, while
the scientific community discusses the potential for non-linear system
behavior. In such a scenario, this process could in turn accelerate PCF
with potentially higher GHG emissions being released to the atmosphere
(Biskaborn et al., 2019; Nitzbon et al., 2024; Schaefer et al., 2014).
According to future projections, estimated GHG emissions from
terrestrial permafrost thaw would range from 100 to 240 billion tons of
C by 2100 based on different climate change scenarios (Meredith et al.,
2019). However, [there is a lack of clarity regarding "the timing,
magnitude and the relative roles of CO2 versus CH4 as feedback
processes]{.underline}" (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021), [and large
uncertainties notably in respect to abrupt thaw events and biological
interactions co-occurring with warming]{.underline} (see for instance
Keuper et al., 2020). Given that the release of C emissions into the
atmosphere has a cumulative effect, the resulting change in the chemical
composition of the atmosphere is projected to persist for several
centuries. Furthermore, [[CH4]{.mark} is a short-lived but potent
greenhouse gas that could accelerate further positive climate feedback
loops, which [could]{.mark} eventually [lead to a **runaway** feedback
effect]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In this context[, [scientific
collaboration to monitor terrestrial permafrost in the Arctic highlights
the critical]{.mark} long-term security
[implications.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[For]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n territory, this is a critical area as
approximately [65% of its soils consist of
permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, [[the western Russian
Arctic permafrost is degrading most rapidly compared to the rest of the
polar region]{.mark},]{.underline} as shown by long-term terrestrial
permafrost monitoring records from the mid-1970s to the early 2020s
(Vasiliev et al., 2020; Westerveld et al., 2023). Based on monitoring
evidence, Western Siberian peatlands, a major C stock, and the Northern
European region of Russia have experienced large changes in the active
layer thickness, which "increased by as much as 0.4 m between 2009 and
2019" (Westerveld et al., 2023).

Moreover, [85% of the Arctic's large permafrost communities]{.underline}
(i.e., defined as those with at least 5000 inhabitants) [are situated in
Russia]{.underline} (Westerveld et al., 2023). The degradation of
terrestrial permafrost, therefore, presents particular challenges to
human security. At the socio-economic level, the Russian Arctic is
characterized by a more extensive and dense infrastructure, including
roads, railways and urban infrastructure consisting of significant large
cities (e.g., Norilsk, Vorkuta, and Yakutsk). These infrastructures are
threatened by thermokarst processes, which are ground subsidence caused
by thawing permafrost. The bulk of the aging infrastructure was
constructed during the Soviet era. However, the country is currently
experiencing unprecedented impacts and financial costs related to its
infrastructure as a result of large-scale permafrost degradation
throughout this century. According to Streletskiy et al. (2023), the
financial burden of the permafrost degradation on all types of
infrastructure in the Russian Arctic is estimated to range between USD
97.5 billion (the lowest estimated figure) and USD 152.8 billion (the
highest estimated figure) over the coming decades. With respect to
public health, the thawing of permafrost may result in the release of
pathogens that have been trapped within the soil for an extended period,
potentially exposing human communities that have settled in these areas.
[The significant reservoir of pathogens]{.underline} [and their range
(i.e., bacteria, fungi, and viruses)]{.underline} [raises the
possibility of their activation as permafrost thaws under changing
Arctic conditions, thereby increasing the prospect of disease
emergence]{.underline} (Christie, 2021; Miner et al., 2021; Wu et al.,
2022). In 2016, an outbreak of the anthrax disease in the Siberian
Arctic spread across the region due to increasing temperatures (Stella
et al., 2020). This event occurred after a severe heat wave thawed an
infected frozen reindeer carcass, highlighting the increasing risk of
contaminant release to water quality, wildlife, and human health from
permafrost thaw (Langer et al., 2023).

In the long term, [permafrost thaw represents a significant and alarming
threat to Russia's political and socio-economic stability, as it would
have the potential to jeopardize the country's public policy strategy in
the Arctic,]{.underline} which has been planned over the past decades[.
Such a scenario would have implications for Russia's future governance
in terms of national security]{.underline}, ultimately impacting the
international security regime. [[Given the complexity of permafrost
monitoring]{.mark}, [scientific cooperation plays an important role in
further advancing knowledge and providing a better projection of future
changes in the stability of terrestrial permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}
and thermokarst processes in the Arctic region and potential global PCF
impacts.

#### Runaway warming from permafrost thaw risks global ecological collapse and extinction

Michael **Huft,** 20**23** --PhD in Biology from the University of
Michigan, JD from Northwestern, BS in Physics from Notre Dame, editor of

Though small or local ecosystems may collapse from time to time from a
variety of causes, [scientists are becoming aware of the possibility
of]{.underline} large-scale, or even [global, ecosystem collapse as [a
consequence of global warming]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly under a
Plan A scenario. Perhaps the [most obvious]{.underline} such event
[[would be the collapse of the oceanic ecosystem resulting from ocean
acidification]{.underline},]{.mark} which would destroy coral reefs and
prevent the formation of the calcium skeletons or exoskeletons of many
marine animals, but most pertinently of foraminifera, which are the base
of many oceanic food chains. Attention has also focused on the
possibility of more extensive collapse on land. A 2004 study (Thomas et
al. 2004) found that under a business as usual scenario, 15--[37 percent
of land animal and plant [species would be committed to extinction by
2050]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Griffin notes that a 2007 study
concluded that the [[plankton]{.mark}, edible fish, [bees, and topsoil,
all of them **essential to human survival**, are in severe
danger]{.mark}]{.underline} and their loss must be averted. A
comparative study of historical extinction rates with those of today
concluded that species are now disappearing at a rate 1,000 times that
of the past and that we are facing a major extinction crisis comparable
to the end of Cretaceous extinction event that spelled the end of the
dinosaurs and large numbers of other species (Pimm et al. 2014).

An important study discussed by Griffin attempts to recognize [planetary
boundaries that must be observed to prevent global ecosystem
collapse]{.underline} (Rockström et al. 2009). The idea is that as the
earth transitions from the Holocene (the geological epoch that began
following the latest glacial era, about 10,000 years ago) to the
Anthropocene (a proposed geological epoch that began at the dawn of the
industrial revolution or later in recognition of the substantial human
im- pact on the earth's geology and biosphere, including climate
change), many of the conditions that permit the maintenance of the
global ecosystem are being altered beyond the bounds that held sway
during the Holocene. The authors ask what the non-negotiable global
preconditions are that we need to respect in order to avoid catastrophic
environmental change on a planetary scale. They refer to the
preconditions as thresholds---a concept that is similar to the tipping
points we have already discussed with respect to irreversible changes
brought on by climate change. Transgressing one or more of these
thresholds could lead to an abrupt change in the global ecosystem. Since
we have no precise knowledge of these thresholds, in particular when, or
under what conditions, they would be triggered, the authors call for
study of the dynamics of these thresholds and the associated feedbacks
on a continental and global scale. They suggest that we agree on a set
of boundaries within which we can expect to operate safely. At one point
it was assumed that a 4°C rise in global temperatures would provide
safety for global ecosystems, but [most scientists]{.underline} later
came to [believe that no more than a 2°C rise will guarantee
safety]{.underline}. However, Rockström et al. (2009) proposed that a
safe boundary would be an increase of no more than 1.5°C. They recognize
nine planetary boundaries, of which three have already been passed.
These include atmospheric CO2 concentration and loss of biodiversity.
They urge that we do what can be done to repair or mitigate the
boundaries that have been passed and also to ensure that no further
boundaries are passed.

Griffin agrees with numerous scientists that [[the release of methane
from permafrost in the Arctic poses the **greatest threat** of collapse
of the global ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark}. Permafrost is the expanse
of soils in the Arctic that has been frozen since the most recent
glacial period. It contains vast amounts of carbon from dead animals and
plants, primarily in the form of methane. It is estimated that [the
carbon in the permafrost constitutes half of all the carbon stored in
the earth's soils]{.underline}. If it were all to be released, [[it
would constitute]{.mark}]{.underline} four or [**[five times]{.mark}**
[all the carbon that has been released by human activity since
1850]{.mark}]{.underline}. The concern is heightened because [the Arctic
is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, which makes thawing
of the permafrost, and the consequent release of methane, even more
likely.]{.underline} This is particularly so, since most of the carbon
is in the top three meters of the permafrost. If the permafrost is on
dry land, the carbon will be broken down by oxygen-breathing bacteria
and released as CO2, whereas if it is below a wetland, it will be
released as methane, which is a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.
It was once thought that the release of methane from permafrost was a
minor problem that would take place only in the distant future. But
[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[strong evidence that the release
is happening now]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recent years, the shallow
waters off [[the Arctic coast of eastern Siberia]{.underline}]{.mark} on
what is known as the Arctic shelf [[is saturated with
methane]{.underline},]{.mark} which was later shown to be arising from
underwater permafrost. [If business as usual continues, the release of
even a portion of the methane stored in the shelf is released, that
could trigger substantial abrupt warming]{.underline}. Because of the
increased warming, [[the methane release will become self-sustaining as
a positive feedback loop, leading **to runaway warming** and
**ecological collapse**.]{.underline}]{.mark} In 2013, it was discovered
that permafrost in the Antarctic region is also subject to warming and
release of carbon.

The principle of Open Science

An argument can be made that impeding science is equivalent to
restricting academic freedom and free speech within science. Moreover,
in a time of diplomatic tension a clear line should be drawn between
trust between scientists and trust between governments; while the latter
focus on matters of state, including security, scientists bear the vital
responsibility of finding solutions for the longterm wellbeing of the
planet. Their work requires establishing facts, which demands
sustainable dialogue and cooperation, whatever the (geo)political
climate. In other words, there is a greater good, even a social
responsibility in 'ringfencing' this essential pursuit from the vagaries
of politics.

In that context, [[science diplomacy is a valuable tool for]{.mark}
reopening dialogue on issues of common interest, and for [enabling
policymakers to better understand Arctic processes]{.mark}, ecosystems,
and environmental changes [and]{.mark} to [make informed decisions based
on evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}. '[Open science' plays a vital role in
the Arctic; it encourages knowledge sharing, collaboration, and
transparency among researchers, Indigenous communities, policymakers,
and other stakeholders]{.underline} (UNESCO, 2021).

[Through open science, [monitoring can occur in real time, which
constitutes the basis for **early warning**, climate modelling, and
**adaptation strategies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Critically, [[these
important functions have been **discontinued** over the Ukraine
war]{.mark}, which harms not only the Arctic but **also other parts of
the world** affected by the knock-on effects of climatic conditions in
the Arctic]{.underline}.

Perhaps most importantly, [by focusing on shared scientific goals and
objectives and addressing common global challenges, scientists can
transcend political differences and work together towards a common
purpose]{.underline}. In turn, abiding by the principle of open science,
[[scientists can pool their expertise]{.mark} and resources [to
develop]{.mark} sustainable and impactful [solutions that **transcend
national boundaries**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Reviving this sense of
common purpose requires a political choice to decouple geopolitical
tensions (as least on an exceptional basis) from the principle of open
science.

The scientific imperative

[The Arctic is experiencing unprecedented environmental changes,
including melting sea ice, permafrost thaw, and shifts in]{.underline}
[ecosystems]{.underline}. Temperatures in the region continue to rise at
four times the global annual average (Rantanen et al. 2022). These
transformations directly affect the entire globe and therefore require
urgent and global responses.

[The international scientific community has not been immune to recent
geopolitical tensions, with Western countries and Russia introducing
reciprocal bans on joint research and scientific projects]{.underline}.
There are notable exceptions, including continuing cooperation on
fisheries, but these are relatively few. While important scientific
research continues in the Russian Arctic, this too is under threat as
sanctions reduce access to Western technology.

Of course, the environmental problems of the Arctic do not recede when
there is a break in international collaboration - if anything they
accelerate. Accordingly, [it is important to consider ways to
'compartmentalise' scientific/environmental issues from hot security
issues]{.underline}. The former are urgent for the globe, not just the
region, and they are sometimes irreversible.

[[With Russia representing]{.mark} almost [60 percent of the
Arctic]{.mark} coast, [there is no escaping the need for]{.mark}
constructive [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} with this key
stakeholder - [**[at least at the level of scientists]{.mark}** - when
it comes to global concerns]{.underline}. [Close [monitoring of the
Arctic is key to improving understanding of]{.mark} the changes that
climate change will bring in the future. These are
**[existential]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [[global
challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It goes without saying that Russia's brutality in Ukraine has profound
consequences - for its millions of victims, but also well beyond
Ukraine, not least for the basic norms underpinning the international
normative framework. This deserves a severe and comprehensive response.
At the same time, though, [both in timescale and scope the urgent
problems of [the Arctic require **joint**]{.mark} and sustained
[attention if they are to be effectively **mitigated**, for the sake of
the **future of humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [dangers associated with]{.mark}]{.underline} the emergence of
possibly [dangerous [pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline} (including viruses)
[[from]{.mark} the me[lting permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cohen,
2023), [[and the spread of radioactive waste]{.underline}]{.mark} (Miner
et al. 2021), [[are]{.mark} just [two]{.mark}]{.underline} examples of
[[risks that will]{.underline}]{.mark} persist and potentially
[[undermine global]{.mark} safety and [health]{.mark}]{.underline},
whether the war in Ukraine is resolved or not. Taking the latter point
further, [[there are thousands of radioactive objects - including spent
fuel and corroding nuclear reactors]{.mark} inside sunken vessels - that
were [dumped at the bottom of the Arctic seas]{.mark} during the Cold
War]{.underline}. Today, political tensions and international sanctions
hinder any retrieval and clean-up efforts as Russia lacks the equipment
and technical expertise to extract these vessels without foreign
assistance (Digges, 2022).

[The severe impact that [radioactive contamination can]{.mark} have on
the environment is undeniable. It can [harm plant and animal life,
disrupt ecosystems, and]{.mark} potentially impact human health through
the consumption of [contaminate]{.mark}d [food and
water]{.mark}.]{.underline} As such, the idea of resuming a discussion
on extracting the sunken vessels and their radioactive waste constitutes
one tangible and universally valuable project that could prove the worth
of decoupling certain issues - even if only on an exceptional basis -
from the situation of the war in Ukraine.

#### This makes new [pandemics]{.underline} likely due to the lack of a contemporary immune response

Christian **Sonne**, 20**24** -- a professor in the Department of
Ecoscience at Aarhus University in Roskilde, Denmark. "Join forces to
counter Arctic pandemic threat" Nature, 9/5, v 633, accessed via
University of Michigan databases //DH

[The Arctic is under stress]{.underline}, that much is known. Between
1979 and 2021[, the region warmed four times faster than the global
average]{.underline}, with effects --- as yet poorly understood --- on
its ecology and ability to store carbon, on global sea levels and on
wider ocean-circulation and weather patterns.

Add in the effects of biodiversity loss and pollution, and people often
refer to a triple planetary crisis. I think we should actually be
talking about a quadruple crisis. Since starting research in the Arctic
in 1997, I have spent nearly all of my summers there, monitoring changes
in pollution levels, habitats and food webs using a 'One Health'
approach that integrates effects on wildlife, humans and ecosystems. And
it's becoming clear that, as the Arctic warms, its environment degrades
and human activities increase, new health threats are emerging. In
particular, [[the Arctic is likely to become a **hotbed for zoonotic
diseases** that spill over into humans from other
animals]{.underline}]{.mark}. That threat was brought home to all of us
by the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to take seriously the possibility that
[[the **next pandemic** could come from the north]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some [[60% of emerging infectious diseases are
zoonoti]{.underline}c]{.mark}. Their emergence and spillover is in
general highly interlinked with habitat degradation, biodiversity loss
and foodweb changes --- all of which are present in the Arctic. But a
warming Arctic harbours other risks. As sea ice thaws, 'forever
chemicals' are increasingly being transported into Arctic environments.
These include mercury, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and
polychlorinated biphenyls, all known to modulate human and animal immune
systems and increase vulnerability to respiratory infections. Invasive
fish and whale species are also bringing in industrial chemicals and
their own diseases.

The pathogens enter an environment in which some native species, such as
polar bears (Ursus maritimus), have not been exposed to them, and so are
at increased risk. [The [release of ancient microorganisms long
frozen]{.mark} in ice and sediments [as the landscape thaws adds to this
danger:]{.mark} [humans and other wildlife are likely to **lack any
immune defences** against them]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[These risk factors are set to increase. The first ice-free Arctic
summers could come as early as the 2030s.]{.underline} The Arctic Ocean
has huge potential for energy, fishery and tourism sectors, and is not
subject to any global treaty regulating its exploitation. Further
wildlife disturbance, pollution, overfishing and jurisdictional
conflicts are the likely result.

The current perception is that the Arctic possesses relatively low
microbial activity. Compared with temperate and tropical latitudes, many
fewer resources are devoted to studying zoonoses in the Arctic, with
sparse surveillance for emerging threats in most areas. This needs to
change --- taking account of human, animal and wider environmental
perspectives.

#### Emerging pandemics risk extinction -- but [early,]{.underline} [rapid]{.underline} response contains the impact

The devastating impact of [[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 has
[highlighted global vulnerabilities to high-consequence biological
events]{.underline}. The international community was woefully unprepared
for [a pandemic]{.underline} that has [[led to millions of deaths and
trillions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars [[in]{.mark} economic
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline}, and has upended daily life. However,
notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
[[COVID]{.underline}-]{.mark}19, it [[should be viewed as a **warning
shot**]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 It will not be the last pandemic humanity
faces, and [[the next]{.underline}]{.mark} high-consequence [[biological
event could be]{.underline}]{.mark} as destructive or [[substantially
worse]{.underline}]{.mark}.

We define [[global catastrophic biological risks]{.underline}]{.mark}
(GCBRs) as biological events of tremendous scale that [[could cause
**severe damage to human civilization**]{.underline}]{.mark},
potentially [[jeopardizing]{.mark} its]{.underline} long-term
**[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 The Johns Hopkins Center for
Health Security has also developed a working definition of GCBRs,3 and
this term is part of a broader discussion about global catastrophic
risks that could arise from a variety of sources, including nuclear war,
anthropogenic climate change, and advanced artificial intelligence that
has not been sufficiently safeguarded.4,5 [[GCBRs could be caused
by]{.mark} a naturally emerging [infectious disease]{.mark} outbreak,
[an accidental release of a pathogen, or a deliberate
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Naturally emerging infectious disease
outbreaks that can grow into [pandemics are likely to increase in
frequency due to urbanization, globalization, and environmental
degradation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the world faces an increasing
risk of high-consequence biological events resulting from accidental or
deliberate misuse of]{.underline} the tools of modern bioscience and
[biotechnology]{.underline}.6-8 Not all outbreaks or global pandemics
will grow to the scale of a GCBR as we define it in this article and as
others have defined global catastrophic risks more broadly, because the
threshold for this type of event is extremely high.

[Although COVID-19 does not rise to the level of a GCBR-scale event, it
has demonstrated that a biological event can have a devastating global
impact]{.underline}, and it should serve as a warning to global leaders
that the world needs much more robust protections against
high-consequence biological events that could emerge in the future and
be substantially worse.

In our view, human-caused biological events involving the accidental or
deliberate misuse of an engineered pathogen are more likely to lead to a
GCBR-scale event than a naturally emerging pandemic.9 [[Scientists have
the capacity to]{.mark} deliberately or inadvertently **[engineer
pathogens]{.mark}** [that are more virulent and transmissible]{.mark}
than what nature creates by chance]{.underline}, and the upper limit of
damage that could be caused by a human-engineered biological event is
unknown.10-12 [[Prevention, **early detection**, and **rapid response**
are]{.mark} all [crucial]{.mark} for guarding against GCBR-scale
events]{.underline}. However, in this article, we focus on effective
strategies for preventing biological events that could become GCBRs,
specifically by disincentivizing development and use of biological
weapons by states and other powerful actors.

#### Permafrost research cooperation can minimize the impact from natural and engineered pandemics

Cambridge, Biosecurity Research Initiative at St Catherine's (BioRISC)

lead to Future Pandemics" Cambridge Journal of Science & Policy, Vol 2

Whilst the current likelihood of the release of a contagious pathogen
from permafrost is likely to be low at present, the current Covid-19
pandemic demonstrates the need to take the risk of such an occurrence
seriously. Increasing levels of human contact with thawing permafrost
directly driven by climate change, as well as increased oil, gas, and
mineral extraction in the [Arctic]{.underline} circle,
[will]{.underline} only [increase [the chance of pathogens being
released from thawing permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular,
the [evidence suggests that the likelihood of localised outbreaks due to
spore-driven pathogens, that cause diseases such as
Anthrax]{.underline}, is at least moderate and [[should be taken]{.mark}
extremely [seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[However, [with increased preparedness, monitoring, and surveillance,
the threat from such pathogens **could be
minimised**]{.mark}]{.underline} to a great extent. For example,
pre-emptive monitoring and surveillance to detect Anthrax outbreaks
should be targeted towards the 13,885 cattle burial grounds scattered
across northern Russia \[6, 28\], whilst local and historical records
can be used to identify more high-risk sites in other parts of the
Arctic Circle (e.g., in Scandinavia and North America). The same
approach is also likely to be useful for identifying old sites of mass
graves for the bubonic plague and Spanish flu using historical records.
[[Early monitoring and surveillance in high-risk areas could catch
dangerous pathogens before they become]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark}
problem]{.underline}.

Such monitoring and surveillance should also consider human exploitation
of the Arctic Circle for oil, gas, and mineral extraction, which may
lead to novel pathogen exposure events. Organisations need to
acknowledge the biosecurity risks involved in undertaking these
activities and ensure adherence to strict biosecurity protocols, so that
risk is minimised for humans in contact with permafrost soils.
Ultimately, to ensure organisations are held accountable for their
actions, local and international laws may need to be considered to
regulate activities in the Arctic Circle from a biosecurity perspective
\[40--42\].

[[Effective surveillance and monitoring for potential outbreaks will
require]{.mark} strong [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} between local
and international public health organisations (such as the World Health
Organisation (WHO)), and [[between governments of countries where most
of the Northern Hemisphere's permafrost exists]{.underline}]{.mark}
(i.e., the USA, Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, and Sweden \[40--42\]).
Whilst such cooperation may be challenging, [the consequences of being
unprepared to contain and respond to developing outbreaks of novel
pathogens from permafrost could represent a serious threat for the
global economy and society]{.underline}, as demonstrated by Covid- 19.
Therefore, it is in the mutual interests of all nations to cooperate in
the monitoring and surveillance of novel pathogen outbreaks from
permafrost.

It is also important to acknowledge that [[pathogens have been
previously used to manufacture]{.mark} and test [biological
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} (mostly by governments in relation to
Anthrax-causing B.anthracis pre- and post-World War II \[43\], but also
more recently in a 2001 attack via letters in the US postal system
\[44\]). Therefore, [[there is]{.mark} clearly [potential for]{.mark}
groups or [organisations with malicious intent to]{.mark} [extract and
modify microorganisms frozen in permafrost]{.mark} for dangerous agendas
and purposes]{.underline} \[45--50\], [[making]{.mark} strong
international [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} and leadership from the
WHO [[even more important]{.underline}]{.mark} in this regard.

Ultimately, tackling the climate crisis and limiting global warming
according to the Paris Agreement will help to address the major driver
behind permafrost thawing and potential release of pathogens. The risk
posed by thawing permafrost, on top of the myriad of threats already
posed by climate change, should inspire all nations to take their
commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions seriously.

Conclusion

The more that human civilisation extracts and exposes permafrost
directly or indirectly through physical exploitation or climate change,
the greater the likelihood that novel pathogens may be released and
cause death and disease in human, animal and plant populations.
[[Underestimating the threat of novel pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}
from unusual sources [has been shown to [carry serious consequences for
**all human civilisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as demonstrated by the
Covid-19 pandemic. Although the likelihood of a pandemic caused by
pathogens in permafrost is relatively low compared to zoonoses (e.g.,
Covid-19), the risks posed by permafrost-related pathogens must be taken
seriously. Creating and implementing appropriate biosecurity management
plans in areas of greatest risk could save many lives and livelihoods.
The effectiveness of these plans at controlling any outbreaks from
permafrost will ultimately depend on strong international cooperation
and regulation by public health organisations and governments.

These troubling [projections of future carbon release due to permafrost
thaw are very likely an underestimate]{.underline} of actual future
emissions [because they do not include critical disturbance processes
that may double the magnitude of the permafrost carbon
feedback]{.underline} (Turetsky et al. 2020, Natali et al. 2021).
[Models of permafrost carbon emissions typically depict permafrost thaw
as a slow top-down process]{.underline} in which elevated air
temperatures gradually increase heat transfer into the soil and thaw
permafrost (e.g., at a rate of \<centimeter per year). However, [[the
**rate** of permafrost thaw can be exacerbated by abrupt, nonlinear
thawing that causes extensive ground collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} in
areas with high ground ice. [[Abrupt thaw events]{.underline}]{.mark},
while often taking place on comparatively small spatial scales, [[can
rapidly expose deeper permafrost layers, and]{.mark} therefore [a larger
volume of stored carbon, over **rapid timescales**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., meters per year or quicker) (Natali et al., 2021). Abrupt thaw
events can be triggered by extreme weather, such as the recent heat
waves in Siberia and Alaska. [[More frequent and severe Arctic]{.mark}
and boreal [wildfires further catalyze the emissions feedback loop from
the permafrost region by directly releasing large amounts of
carbon]{.mark} during combustion]{.underline}, and by expediting
permafrost thaw (Natali et al., 2021). All of these processes are
accelerating due to climate change, and [the scientific community is
increasingly recognizing the amplifying effect that these
under-represented mechanisms of carbon loss from the permafrost region
have on the magnitude and timescale of resulting emissions]{.underline}
(Turetsky et al. 2020).

Unfortunately, [[only a small minority of global-scale climate models
incorporate permafrost thaw, and none of these represent processes other
than gradual thaw.]{.underline}]{.mark} Models used to inform nationally
determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, for example, failed
to account for key processes that can greatly accelerate permafrost thaw
rates and carbon emissions, notably abrupt thaw and wildfires in Arctic
regions (Baillargeon et al., 2021). For almost a decade, the IPCC has
reported with high confidence the likelihood of a permafrost carbon
feedback on global climate. Yet, the IPCC reports low confidence when it
comes to assessing the timing, magnitude, and form (carbon dioxide or
methane) of this feedback. The latest Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) made
a significant step forward as it was the first time that permafrost
carbon was included in the Earth System Models that informed the IPCC
report (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, CMIP6) (Ciais et
al., 2013; IPCC 2018; Canadell et al., 2021) (IPCC, 2021). However, just
two of 11 ESMs in CMIP6 included permafrost and neither of these models
represented abrupt thaw, wildfire-mediated thaw, or the release of
carbon from below-ground combustion during wildfire (Canadell et al
2021, Natali et al., 2022).

Improving certainty of permafrost thaw for more effective mitigation and
adaptation policies.

While rapid progress is being made by the scientific community in this
area[, [the sparse nature of **on-the-ground** measurements]{.mark}
[combined with the scale and complexity of Arctic regions and
**limitations on funding**]{.mark} relative to the need for improving
permafrost representation in models [remain a considerable
challenge]{.mark} to progress]{.underline} (Natali et al., 2022). [This
ongoing scientific challenge highlights the need to more effectively and
expeditiously communicate the science of permafrost thaw to key
decision-makers and for decision-makers to then integrate this science
into ambitious climate policy.]{.underline}

[Advancing [Arctic carbon monitoring and modeling is necessary to truly
understand the magnitude and timescale of permafrost thaw
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[[and respond]{.underline}]{.mark}**
accordingly. Permafrost emissions could take up as much as 40% of the
remaining carbon budget to stay below 2°C warming (Gasser et al., 2018).
[That fraction is even higher if the goal is limiting warming to
1.5°C---the threshold at which we can expect to trigger a critical
tipping point for permafrost, ice sheets, and coral reefs]{.underline}
(Armstrong McKay, et al., 2022). [[Resolving scientific uncertainty
surrounding permafrost thaw is therefore critical]{.mark} for ensuring
the accuracy of the United States' carbon budget and national
ambition]{.underline}. [The potential harm from neglecting permafrost
thaw cannot be overstated. Even [the most alarming
projections]{.mark}]{.underline} of 3-41 GtCO₂ per 1°C [[of
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} by 2100 [likely **[underestimate]{.mark}**
the potential of [permafrost]{.mark} carbon
e[mission]{.mark}s]{.underline} (Baillargeon & Natali, 2021; Natali et
al., 2021). While the Administration has committed to reducing emissions
by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030, this goal will likely be insufficient
if the carbon budget does not account for permafrost thaw.

[[Resolving scientific uncertainty is also a **prerequisite to informing
adaptation**]{.mark} **policies** that better respond to the urgent and
severe impacts of permafrost thaw on Arctic communities.]{.underline}
Federal emergency response and disaster relief programs, including those
under the 1988 Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act ("Stafford Act"), often do not consider slow-onset
impacts of permafrost thaw, and state, local, and tribal governments are
simply not equipped to the hazards of permafrost thaw without federal
support (Bronen, 2021). As communities realize the limits of their
capacity to adapt to climate change in their current locations, some are
considering relocation as the only viable long-term option. The U.S.
Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently concluded that more than
70 out of over 200 Alaskan Native villages face significant threats from
erosion, flooding, or thawing permafrost (GAO, 2022)--nearly a decade
after the GAO identified 31 Alaskan villages in such a position (GAO,
2009). Despite efforts by three Alaska Native communities to fully
relocate, to date, no village has successfully completed this process.
Instead, communities are facing insurmountable obstacles, citing a lack
of governance framework, dedicated federal funding, and government
support to facilitate relocation efforts (Bronen and Chapin, 2013;
Bronen 2021).

1\. Introduction

Permafrost is essential in the Arctic region as it plays a significant
role in undergirding the ground, thus supporting infrastructure and
countering erosion, which can be globally impactful (Beer et al., 2020;
Larsen et al., 2021). In addition, [[permafrost is vital in storing
carbon.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, [the Arctic has experienced
increased temperatures]{.underline} in the past few decades, [driving
permafrost to thaw and releasing greenhouse gases]{.underline} (GHG)
into the atmosphere (Schuur et al., 2022). The thawing of permafrost has
large-scale environmental implications and impacts the economy and
culture of coastal communities and beyond (Beer et al., 2020;
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022; Lamoureux and
Lafreniere, 2018). Fig. 1, produced by the European Space Agency\'s
(ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) permafrost project (Obu et al.,
2021), shows the spatial distribution of permafrost active layer
thickness across the northern hemisphere.

The intensive, ubiquitous burning of fossil fuels since the mid-1800s
has led GHGs to spike in the atmosphere, which is responsible for the
permafrost melt in various areas, including the Arctic (Friedlingstein
et al., 2019; Schuur, 2016). Between 2007 and 2016, for instance, the
ground temperature near the depth of zero annual amplitude -- i.e., the
depth at which annual temperature fluctuations are dampened to less than
0.1 °C -- in the continuous permafrost zone increased by 0.39 ± 0.15 °C
(Biskaborn et al., 2019).

Due to decreasing ice cover over most Arctic regions, the 'snow-ice
albedo feedback' has been affected. As a result, less solar radiation is
reflected, and more heat is absorbed on the surface, causing further
warming and thus increasing permafrost thawing (Riihelä et al., 2021).

Permafrost contains carbon-based organic matter, consumed by
microorganisms whenever it thaws, releasing methane (CH4) and other
gases (Masyagina and Menyailo, 2020), which, in turn, impacts microbial
communities (Lamoureux and Lafreniere, 2018). Moreover, the current
[[permafrost thaw will likely intensify]{.underline}]{.mark} under this
century\'s projected [[global warming and the release of substantial
amounts of GHG, exacerbating the problem]{.mark}]{.underline} (Schuur et
al., 2015). Since soil respiration responds to warming more strongly in
colder climates than in warmer ones, these emissions are of particular
concern (Carey et al., 2016), resulting in increased CO2 emissions and
CH4 (Grant et al., 2019), thus intensifying climate change.

Moreover, wildfires\' increasing occurrence and broadening (Kasischke
and Turetsky, 2006) are powerful yet underestimated stressors in fragile
permafrost contexts (Gibson et al., 2018).

2\. The impacts of permafrost thaw

Continuous and discontinuous permafrost covers about 15 % of the land
surface in the northern hemisphere (Smith et al., 2022; Obu, 2021). This
figure highlights the urgency of addressing climate change and
protecting permafrost. Retreating and spatial shifting in the
distribution of frozen ground alters the forest cover, hydrology,
species habitats and human life in the areas affected (Czerniawska and
Chlachula, 2020). The thawing of permafrost not only exerts consequences
on terrain, ecosystems and infrastructure but may also delay or impair
international efforts concerning sustainable development (Hjort et al.,
2022; Leal Filho et al., 2022, Leal Filho et al., 2023) and CO2
abatement (Schuur et al., 2022; Turetsky et al., 2019), influencing the
various climate scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), 2022). Fig. 2 captures some of the multi-faceted, diverse
impacts of permafrost depletion.

The anatomy of the rock and sub-soil structure involved in how
permafrost unfolds and the spatial extents, geometry, and shallow-seated
mechanism of how the affected terrain ruptures due to thawing (Smith et
al., 2022) unveils a peculiar shallow behaviour. For instance, thawing
has waned the concrete integrity of the ground/foundations where
infrastructure has been built over the decades (Hjort et al., 2022;
Langer et al., 2023). Threats to existing infrastructure related to
permafrost thawing include active layer thickenings and thaw-related
hazards, such as thermokarst and mass wasting (Schuur, 2016; Schuur et
al., 2015).

The risk of permafrost-related degradation will likely increase
significantly by 2050, with infrastructural impairment already
documented in swaths of Russian territory, where many buildings and
legacy fuel storage facilities are experiencing damage and whose leakage
(e.g., of old Soviet-era fuel storage tank ruptures) may pose a further
threat to the environment as well (Langer et al., 2023; Wrigley, 2023).

For example, in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 30 % of roads were reported
to have been affected (Hjort et al., 2022). In addition, the risk of
structural damage and leakage of hazardous waste is projected to be very
significant over the following decades, whatever the reference climate
scenario (Langer et al., 2023).

Apart from causing terrain rupture and ensuing damage to the built
environment, permafrost thawing has been driving vast alterations to the
natural landscapes of the northern regions since the 1960s (Turetsky et
al., 2019). In high-altitude areas hosting glaciers, rapid
transformation due to permafrost degradation has led to the onset of new
lakes and drainage networks, with ensuing reduced slope stability that
may further trigger flooding due to mobilised deposits and water mass
(Haeberli et al., 2017), ultimately adding potential strain to
infrastructure and human life in the exposed regions.

The thawing of permafrost also releases chemical, biological and
radioactive components that have been locked under various forms in both
the cryosphere and the geosphere over the 103--105 yr span, resulting in
vast disruptions of ecosystems, altered wildlife populations and
prospective endangerment to the human health (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), 2022; Miner et al., 2021).

[[Permafrost thaws at different rates]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022), [[and slower
thawing tends to affect the shallower, more recently frozen
layers]{.underline}]{.mark} of soil, rock and ice, penetrating the
deeper sections of permafrost. However, [[abrupt
thawing]{.underline}]{.mark}, capable of dismantling whole rock and soil
sections, [[affects older, deeper layers]{.underline}]{.mark} (Turetsky
et al., 2019). While the thawing phase depends on temperature and
precipitation changes and may occur gradually, the rate increases as
temperatures are consistently higher -- all the more in Arctic regions
-- and vast areas and volumes of permafrost can be lost per decade
(Turetsky et al., 2020).

3\. Moving forward: addressing an issue more global than commonly
perceived

The [**[rapid depletion]{.mark}** [of permafrost in the Arctic]{.mark}
threatens efforts to reduce global warming]{.underline}. In addition,
[it [heightens climate change in other regions]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022; Masyagina and
Menyailo, 2020) to the extent that may elude -- both in space and time
-- the assumed geographic boundaries of cold permafrost regions "up
North". Despite ample literature, this has contributed to a somewhat
slow and sparse perception throughout societies of the phenomenon, its
long-time onset, and its cascading spatial effects (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022).

Abrupt thawing occurring through extreme temperature fluctuations can
expose older permafrost horizons more rapidly than earlier estimated.
Depending on local conditions and the rock and soil fabric involved,
such a phenomenon may initiate the release of compounds from deeper
layers much faster than expected (Turetsky et al., 2019). There are also
concerns that permafrost degradation will eventually expose ancient
burial sites, thus possibly reviving vectors that, under present-day
temperature conditions, could spread deadly infections or allow the
re-emergence of pathogens, thus potentially endangering human health
(Huber et al., 2020). Therefore, actionable, effective [[solutions are
needed to **slow down the rate** at which permafrost thawing
grows]{.underline}]{.mark} -- including the engagement of the public
discourse.

[Some]{.underline} of the [[measures which may help]{.underline}]{.mark}
to handle permafrost thawing [[are:]{.underline}]{.mark}

i\) [Installing [permafrost insulation to shield]{.mark} permafrost
[from the]{.mark} heat of the [sun]{.mark}]{.underline} and other
environmental factors affecting the terrain\'s integrity. [This could
include insulation boards and thermal blankets]{.underline} around
buildings, pipelines, and other structures built on permafrost.

ii\) [Planting more [cover crops]{.mark}]{.underline} can help [[to keep
permafrost cool]{.underline}]{.mark} and stabilise the ground. Perennial
grasses and trees can provide shade, which can help reduce the
permafrost thaw rate. In addition, these plants may help to keep the
soil moist and add organic matter to help improve the soil quality.

iii\) [Facilitating [groundwater recharge can]{.mark} help [keep
permafrost cool]{.mark}]{.underline} and reduce the thaw rate. This can
be attained [[by constructing rainwater harvesting]{.mark}
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} and using porous pavings to increase the
amount of rainwater stored in the ground.

iv\) [[Improving snow cover]{.underline}]{.mark} can help keep
permafrost cool and reduce the thaw rate. This can be done [[by planting
trees and shrubs to create shade]{.mark} or using snow
fences]{.underline} to accumulate snow and reduce the speed at which it
melts.

Permafrost melting is an urgent environmental issue, as it can
contribute to global warming and impact the environment in a diverse
range of issues across vast regions. Reducing GHG emissions to address
this issue, a critical driver of permafrost melting, is crucial. It is
also essential to understand the local impacts of permafrost melting,
such as increased flooding, erosion, and water and soil contamination.
In some areas, protecting infrastructure, ecosystems, and communities
from the effects of permafrost melting becomes necessary.

In summary, the depletion of permafrost is a serious problem because it
has several negative impacts. For example, it can:

• Destabilise infrastructure, such as roads and buildings.

• Increase the risk of flooding and landslides.

• Release CH4, a potent GHG, into the atmosphere.

• Disrupt ecosystems and food webs.

Therefore, GHG emissions need to be reduced to slow the thawing of
permafrost and reduce its negative impacts.

Finally, [[it is vital to **monitor permafrost more intensively** to
**detect early signs** of melting and **ensure appropriate measures can
be taken** promptly]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Trump has incentives to support adaptation

Evan **Bloom**, 20**25** - Senior Advisor, Centre for the Ocean and the
Arctic, UiT -- The Arctic University of Norway, and former U.S. diplomat
"US Policies in the Arctic Are Changing but the Extent Remains to Be
Seen" High North News, 4/10,

<https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/us-policies-arctic-are-changing-extent-remains-be-seen>
//DH

[In 2019]{.underline}, under the last Trump Administration, [the U.S.
vetoed the Council's]{.underline} ministerial [declaration]{.underline}
at Rovaniemi, primarily due to references [it contained related to
climate change]{.underline}.

[However, the U.S. did not go further and prevent work within the
Council's technical working groups related to climate]{.underline}.
Today, the Administration will face a similar choice.

With other countries (Russia aside) wanting the Council to continue to
focus on its traditional core efforts to promote science-based research
and policies related to environment and climate change, will the U.S.
allow that work to continue?

Or this time, would it block those efforts that are likely to be sought
by the Nordics and Canada?

In Arctic matters, in particular within the State of Alaska, outreach to
and inclusion of views of Indigenous Peoples play an important role in
policy development and implementation.

Will the Trump Administration accommodate Indigenous interests, or will
these somehow be deemed akin to promoting social equity and inclusion
policies that the Administration opposes in other contexts?

[[The]{.mark} current [Administration will]{.mark} no doubt [be
unwilling to support climate research in the Arctic, but that
isn't]{.mark} quite [the same as denying that]{.mark} the
[climate]{.mark} is changing and [requires]{.mark} local
[adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Perhaps [[the Administration]{.underline}]{.mark} [as it develops its
policies [will acknowledge]{.mark} [the]{.mark} reality of
[permafrost]{.mark} melt and its **[impact on
infrastructure]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Even if]{.mark} the release of [carbon]{.mark} emissions
[isn't]{.mark} a focus of [its concern, the federal government may
acknowledge the need to address collapsing roads and buildings in
Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Thus, Arctic States will need to have some patience as various American
policies becoming clearer. And in the meantime, they can task their
diplomats with expressing to the U.S. their thoughts on some of these
topics in the hope of influencing the formulation of U.S. positions.

### 1ac -- Arctic diplomacy

#### Contention 2 is Arctic Diplomacy

#### Trump's funding cuts to Arctic science are ending science diplomacy

Ralph Ranalli: John, you've been a scientist your whole life. You're a
physicist. What is it about science? [[The Arctic has
been]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a science-centric collaborative
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}---so what is it about when you lead
with science that leads to this kind of cooperation and gives people the
ability to work together where, in other situations, they would not be
able to work together.

John Holdren: That's a great question. The experience that I've had in a
variety of domains, including not just environmental science, energy
technology and policy, international security and arms control, is that
[if you bring scientists together, they find they have a common basis
for a conversation]{.underline}. That is, they have been trained in
similar ways. They have been trained to think to at least some degree
logically. I mean, scientists are humans too, and they do think
emotionally as well as logically. But [the fact that they have a common
language, and substantially common backgrounds, enables communication to
work]{.underline} sometimes [when folks with other backgrounds are
having more difficulty]{.underline}.

But one of the things that is, that is very nice about it is it's
contagious. That is, you know, I've been working with Russians since
1971, starting with an exchange on theoretical plasma physics between a
Russian group and I was at the Lawrence Livermore Lab doing theoretical
plasma physics at the time. I've been working with the Chinese on these
issues since 1984. And the degree of communication, the degree of
empathy between scientists, as I say, is contagious. And so in all of
these engagements I've had, they always included not just scientists,
but also political figures, social scientists, as well as natural
scientists and it's very effective.

And [one of the things that worries me]{.underline}, frankly, [about
today]{.underline}'s situation, [is that]{.underline} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[has been fracturing these
bonds. It has been preventing Americans]{.underline},]{.mark} [whether
they're scientists or political figures, [from attending international
meetings]{.mark} on these topics]{.underline}. [[It's been
undermining]{.mark} the support for [research]{.mark}]{.underline} on
these topics [[in U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} universities and [[national
laboratories]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[unless we]{.mark} figure out
how to [reverse this,]{.mark} this process of **[science
diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}---engaging a wide array of actors in
common cause to address problems that it's in everyone's interest to
solve---[**[is]{.mark}** going to be **[in big
trouble]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Jennifer Spence: If I could just add, I think one of the things that we
have to sort of recognize is that we we're at a place of difficulty. [We
were at a place of difficulty with Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. One of the fundamental differences, that you
didn't see during the Cold War, was the decision to cut relationships
and funding to collaborations with Russian scientists. And [that's had
huge implications in the Arctic]{.underline}.

And that is something that, that has happened with a lot of
institutions, in a way that hopefully\... I mean, we've seen some
opportunities for that to soften since then. But, again, [[one of the
functions of science diplomacy during difficult times is, when]{.mark}
the political [leaders can't speak to each other]{.mark}]{.underline},
you know [[you still have channels of
communication]{.underline}]{.mark}. And that has become increasingly
difficult in the current context. And [the question becomes trying to
find this balance between the huge issues like climate change, where we
need to find ways to cooperate, we need common data,]{.underline} we
need those issues. And at the same time recognize that you're not
endorsing a particular administration and the actions of a particular
administration, that may be a fundamental challenge to cooperation in
other levels. And how do you find that balance? There's no right answer.
These are very difficult questions, and yet I believe that a lot of the
people that I work with feel that there's a need to try and make space
for both of those at the same time.

John Holdren: Let me just add two points about that. One, [[the
challenge of Russia having isolated itself through]{.mark} [their
invasion of Ukraine is]{.mark} particularly [acute, because
Russia]{.mark} owns and [occupies]{.mark} about [half of the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} And so [[if you want to study]{.mark}
what's happening in the Arctic]{.underline}, if you want to study what's
happening with wildfires, [if you want to study what's happening with
[permafrost thaw]{.mark}]{.underline}, if you want to study what's
happening to coastal waters in the Arctic, [[you have to engage]{.mark}
with the [Russians.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The second point I want to make is that the [[Russian scientists]{.mark}
who've been involved in this work over the years still [want to
engage]{.mark}]{.underline}. We've had ways to be in touch with a fair
number of them, and they all recognize what they are losing and what we
are losing when that cooperation is fractured.

#### Russian isolation will collapse the Arctic Council, but scientific cooperation can restore it

Carol **Dyck,** 20**24** -- doctoral student Western University, Faculty
of Law "On thin ice: The Arctic Council's uncertain future" Marine
Policy Volume 163, May 2024,

//DH

[[The future of the Arctic Council]{.mark} now [hangs in the
balance]{.mark}]{.underline}. The ongoing [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}
war [has [triggered renewed military posturing in the Arctic
Ocean]{.mark}, further souring relations between the Member
States]{.underline}.27 In May 2022 Senior Arctic Officials (SAOs)
continued to search for solutions to the two month pause, a situation
complicated by Russia holding the Chairmanship. By June 2022 [the Arctic
seven announced that they would "implement a limited resumption of
\[their\] work in the Arctic Council on projects that do not involve the
participation of the Russian Federation]{.underline}" and would
"continue to examine additional modalities to allow \[them\] to further
continue the council's important work."28; Meanwhile, academics likewise
explored whether the remaining seven Member States could establish a new
Arctic organization to address cooperation in the region without
Russia.29 The American coordinator for the Arctic region, James P.
Deltart, of the US State Department rejected that option stating,

Creating an alternative structure to the Arctic Council is not on our
agenda. We believe the Council holds the greatest value as a circumpolar
forum including all the eight Arctic states and binding together the
people who live throughout the entire region.30

Senior Arctic Officials remain wary of making rash decisions which may
prevent a future return to normalcy in the Arctic Council. [To abandon
the Arctic Council altogether would permanently isolate
Russia]{.underline}, an imprudent move given that Russia is, from "a
variety of biophysical and socioeconomic perspectives \[...\], the
preeminent Arctic State."31; A new regional Arctic body that does not
include Russia would lack scope and breadth, threatening its ability to
fulfill its goals or objectives.

Furthermore, China made clear in October 2022 that it would not
acknowledge an Arctic Council that does not include Russia.32 At the
time, the Chinese Special Envoy to the Arctic, Feng Gao, stated at the
Arctic Circle Assembly that,

The Arctic Council is based on a declaration and there is no procedure
for leaving the Council. I doubt that the Chairmanship can be
transferred to anyone or that Norway can take over the Chair without
Russia from a legal point of view.33

If the remaining seven Member States go forward with a different
institution, it is unclear whether China would recognize its
legitimacy.34 China may also decline to participate as an Observer in
the Arctic Council if Russia is barred from meetings and collaborative
research projects. At the same time, it appreciates that it must not
adversely affect its relationships with the other Arctic Council Member
States.35 Given that China is proving itself a significant and
formidable player in the Arctic, its absence from the Arctic Council, or
a new regional forum without Russia, could undermine efforts to address
Arctic shipping, fishing, and other economic and environmental concerns.
China may see this current crisis as an opportunity to double down on
its efforts to open governance to the international community and
increase its influence.

On May 11, 2023 Norway assumed Chairship36 of the Arctic Council
following a sparsely-attended ceremony which took place both in
Salekhard, Russia and online. Though the Meeting ran relatively smoothly
following months of negotiations between Russia and Norway, it was the
first instance that the transfer of Chair was not through a
"Ministerial" meeting.37 When Norway took over as Chair, the
long-present note on the Arctic Council's website which read, "The
Arctic Council is pausing all official meetings of the Council and its
subsidiary bodies until further notice" was removed.38 However, at the
time of writing, political meetings at the high level cannot take place,
nor are SAO meetings planned for the immediate future.39 Norway has a
difficult task ahead, attempting to bring the Arctic States together and
working towards the goal of a fully functioning Arctic Council. On the
surface, all Arctic States assert that they wish to keep the Arctic as a
"territory of peace, stability and mutually beneficial cooperation to
ensure its sustainable and safe development", as voiced by the Russian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs,40 but mistrust and suspicion remain
pervasive, driving a wedge between the Member States as well as between
the Observers.

[[The pause in Arctic Council projects involving Russia comes as the
Arctic faces mounting threats, when cooperation]{.mark} and
collaboration [are most urgent to ensure proactive protection of
its]{.mark} marine and terrestrial [ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}
through forward thinking policies, strong governance structures and
ongoing scientific endeavours. While Arctic Member States have stated
their commitment to the Arctic Council, and Norway, as the new Chair, is
engaging in talks with all Members and Working Groups to restore the
Council by the end of its term, its future is still tenuous. The loss of
this forum would further complicate relations in other realms,
particularly security. Russia feels threatened by Finland's acceptance
into NATO, creating a new 1340 km Finnish NATO border, while the
remaining Arctic Member States warily eye Russia's Arctic military build
up, raising the risk of regionalized conflict.41 [[While military issues
are not the remit of the Arctic Council, the opportunities afforded by
cooperative work within the Council allowed Arctic States to engage in
constructive dialogue that could address disagreements]{.mark} [or
misunderstandings]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The current situation is
further aggravated by the collapse of bilateral agreements]{.mark} since
the start of the Ukraine war [and the Council
shutdown]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Russia, for instance, announced
its termination of the bilateral agreement it has had with Finland since
2000 to engage in yearly extra military evaluation visits, demonstrating
"yet another trust-building measure in the military field" that has
dissolved.42 Similarly, Russia withdrew from the Barents Euro-Arctic
Council in September 2023, placing the responsibility for the end to
cooperation on the Western Members of the Council, stating that
"\[t\]hrough the fault of the Western Members, the Council's activities
have been effectively paralyzed since March 2022\" \[5\]. The Russian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at the time, "Russia will continue to
pursue its national objectives in the north. We remain open to
cooperation with anyone who is committed to constructive engagement and
is prepared for equal dialogue and mutually beneficial collaborative
work."43

[Russia, feeling isolated from the Arctic Council]{.underline} since
March 2022, [has actively sought]{.underline} new partners, specifically
[non-Western and non-Arctic partners, with which it can work in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Nikolay Korchunov, the Russian Arctic Ambassador,
has stated that Russia's

line in the Arctic Council will depend on the situation's further
development and respect for Russian interests. With the Council's
weakened role and effectiveness, provoked by our Western partners, we
are already engaged in active dialogue with an Arctic agenda in various
formats with other countries and organizations."44

During the remainder of Russia's Chairmanship, when the remaining Arctic
States declined to participate in projects involving Russia, it
continued to carry out a number of events in line with its agenda with
what it called "friendly countries" - China, Brazil, Mongolia, Belarus
and Kazakhstan.45 This growing division into camps is clearly
disconcerting and, should it continue, will prove counterproductive as
Arctic and non-Arctic States strive to address Northern issues.

Russia's Arctic Ambassador has clarified that Russia has no intention of
creating an alternate forum to the Arctic Council, but his comments
similarly suggest that it will remain in the Council only as long as it
serves Russia's interests and respects its right to participate in
Arctic Council meetings and work.46 Still, Russia has lamented that the
collapse in relations has resulted in little activity by the Arctic
Council's Working Group on Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna during
a time in which growing economic activity in the North along with
climate change are resulting in increased pressure on Arctic species and
ecosystems.47 This concern could serve as a jumping off point for
rebuilding relations between the Arctic States in particular. In
September 2023, the Arctic States approved new guidelines so that its
Working Groups could return to existing projects and propose new
projects.48 Morten Høglund, Norway's Arctic ambassador and the Chair of
the Senior Arctic Officials under the Norwegian Chairship, believes that
returning to the levels of collaboration prior to the Russian invasion
of Ukraine will necessitate "a lot of time", Norway aims to "resume
large parts of \[Arctic Council\] work in several important fields, such
as climate, and start new projects."49

The question remains to what extent the Arctic seven are open to trust
Russia at this time. Kal Kornhuber et al. argue that, "\[r\]esuming key
elements of critically needed scientific and political cooperation is
dependent on the end of Russian aggression against Ukraine."50; Indeed,
the Russian State's readiness to violate international law and escalate
conflicts, signals that disagreements with Russia "must now be viewed in
a new light."51; However, for Ambassador Høglund, "functioning
cooperation between all Arctic countries is important" and "\[t\]he best
answer to possible challenges with such cooperation is that we hold on
to the Arctic Council as the most important forum for Arctic issues."52;
[[With military activity steadily rising]{.mark} in the
north]{.underline}53 [[and alliances crumbling]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
situation reminiscent of the Cold War, [[soft power outlets are needed
more than eve]{.underline}r]{.mark}. While the Russian invasion of
Ukraine has broken trust, [[an Arctic Council without participation of
Russia would be severely impaired; the global community would likely
have real doubts about its legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Rebuilding
that trust is critical as the Arctic experiences rising ecological,
economic and geopolitical stressors associated with accelerated warming;
principally focusing on common environmental challenges, **through [the
resumption of scientific collaboration with Russia]{.mark}**[, **could
serve as that first key goodwill step**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Arctic Council collapse causes [fragmented]{.underline} Arctic governance -- that increases the risk of war and environmental catastrophe

7\. Conclusion: old principles, new challenges

The current political and economic environment differs greatly from the
immediate post-Cold War era that brought opportunities for Arctic States
to build trust and collaborate for their mutual benefit. With the
potential for great wealth in a newly accessible Arctic, [[a shift
to]{.underline}]{.mark} decidedly [[more unilateral approaches to the
Arctic may occur.]{.mark} Even before the Ukraine war,]{.underline}
former US Secretary of State [Pompeo's speech in Rovaniemi engendered
more nationalistic individualism]{.underline} than it did the spirit of
Gorbachev's 1987 speech calling for "a genuine zone of peace and
fruitful cooperation,86 demonstrating just how far the Member States and
Observers have strayed from the principles of the Ottawa Declaration.

Following the 2013 Ministerial Meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, the Council
released its Vision for the Arctic, in which the Member States and
Permanent Participants stated, "We are confident that there is no
problem that we cannot solve together through our cooperative
relationships on the basis of existing international law and good
will."87; [Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, breaching a key
principle of international law, quickly [unraveled the goodwill and
cooperation that characterized Arctic diplomacy over the past
twenty-five years. The "Arctic exceptionalism" bubble burst, leaving
many to question the Council's continued ability to maintain peace and
foster constructive dialogue when trust between the Arctic States is
severely compromised]{.underline}. [Non-Arctic States, like China, may
use this opportunity to intensify their calls for global Arctic
governance or attempt to profit from the shaky status of the Arctic
Council by expanding bilateral agreements with an isolated
Russia]{.underline}. As the Ukraine war continues, a quick return to the
previous cooperative spirit is unlikely. [A void in Arctic governance
has emerged when cooperation is most critical.]{.underline}

Whether the Member States wish it or not, [**[change is now inevitable
for the Arctic Council]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Climate change is
forever altering the physical geography of the Arctic]{.underline},
opening a once isolated region to the global economy and
intercontinental transportation routes. The North is no longer a
peripheral area of international relations; the "new" Arctic will
increasingly take center stage in foreign and economic policies. [The
Council must now adapt both to the unprecedented situation that has
stalled its operations, and restructure itself to adapt to the
ecological and socioeconomic pressures reshaping the Arctic
environment]{.underline}, all while political and military tension
threaten to destabilize the region.

The war in Ukraine demonstrated that the Arctic is not immune to
complications of high politics and conflict far from its borders.
Regardless of the situation in Ukraine, every effort must be made to
resume Arctic Council operations with full Russian participation. From a
purely scientific perspective, scientists and research institutes have
previously noted the loss of scientific mores during periods of conflict
and war.88 With the diplomatic fallout of the Ukraine War, [[the
inability]{.mark} for some scientists [to engage in field work within
Russian territory]{.mark}, along with the freeze in certain projects, is
[already resulting in "significant gaps" in Arctic research
data]{.mark}]{.underline}.89 Additionally, [[the war increases the
critical nature of maintaining cooperation in the Arctic to **reduce
military posturing** and the **risk of sparking active
conflict**]{.underline}; [the collaborative atmosphere of the Arctic
Council has]{.underline} ]{.mark}[until now [provided]{.mark}
opportunities for communication and [diplomacy on issues **beyond the
Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} through the ups and downs of East-West
relations.90 At the start of its Chairmanship Russia reminded the
Council that it has worked consistently to guard the Arctic "as the
territory of peace, stability and constructive cooperation."91 It added
that Arctic States "carry special responsibility for the future of the
region and its inhabitants."92 This sense of duty should encourage the
Member States to find a solution to the current impasse.

A return to the original spirit of Gorbachev's Murmansk speech could
restore the congeniality between the Member States. [[Rebuilding trust
between all the Arctic States is paramount to Arctic Ocean
governance]{.mark}; efforts at Arctic conservation can only succeed if
the coastal Arctic States]{.underline}, in particular, [work together.
[Member States should]{.mark} revisit the foundation of their Arctic
accomplishments, and **[re-initiate scientific
collaboration]{.mark}**]{.underline} and knowledge sharing [[that
includes **projects in Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the largest Arctic
State. The Ottawa Declaration, and the Arctic Environmental Protection
Strategy (AEPS) before it, could provide the key to renewing goodwill
and re-examining the future of Arctic governance. The Council should
focus on shared threats and challenges, bearing in mind the Principle of
the Common Concern of Humankind, to revitalize peer-to-peer dialogue and
collaboration. The threats of [climate change in the fragile Arctic
environment demand enhanced scientific cooperation "to monitor and
improve our understanding of how and to what degree the Arctic climate
is changing]{.underline}."93 **[Should relations sour even
further]{.underline}** and Russia choose to exit the Arctic Council,
[the international community would suffer with the permanent loss of
this forum which has furthered understanding of complex ecological
processes]{.underline} and assisted in vital policy work. As many have
noted, "Russia's importance, especially for Arctic environmental and
climate research, is irreplaceable."94

While some advisors challenge the possibility of a "return to the
pre-war reality",95 Norway, as Chair of the Arctic Council, is
optimistic that **[[relations can be repaired]{.underline}]{.mark}**.96
As a focal point for collaboration and cooperation, [[**science can play
a critical role** in regaining trust, rebuilding diplomacy, and
**maintaining peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The AEPS, with its focus on
monitoring, assessment, and protection of the Arctic environment,
succeeded in bringing the East and West together in the early years
following the end of the Cold War. Those same mutual interests, and [the
less formal venue in which to share knowledge, could bring the Arctic
Member States back together again. Time is running out on taking
precautionary measures]{.underline} to protect the Arctic. [The Arctic
environment cannot be sacrificed to realpolitik when a unique
opportunity exists to work collaboratively to regulate emergent
industries and transportation before potentially irreversible damage
occurs]{.underline}. The coastal Arctic states must recognize their
shared mutual interest in working together to maintain a regional
influence over an Arctic governance that best reflects their goals and
concerns. [[A more accessible Arctic requires **strong leadership**; a
divided Arctic Council]{.mark} simply [cannot meet the]{.mark} pressing
[challenges]{.mark} put before it.]{.underline}

In the twenty-seven years since its creation, the Arctic Council has
succeeded in bringing global attention to the fragility of the Arctic
and its connection to global ecological systems. As political and
economic forces permeate the Arctic, successfully addressing Arctic
issues depends on strong alliances and mutual trust between Arctic
Council Members, Observers and Permanent Participants. The peaceful
relations and cooperation emblematic of the post-Cold War Arctic
resulted from the opportunities for dialogue provided by the Arctic
Council, even in times of heightened tensions. [The more congenial
format of the Arctic Council, one not based on rigid legal obligations,
has allowed for greater openness, and frank dialogue, sometimes lacking
in more formal diplomatic settings]{.underline}. [Those [channels of
communication and cooperation must remain open for the **good of the
planet and humanity.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The Arctic is facing
unprecedented challenges; Arctic governance must not disintegrate when
robust regulations and transnational peace and cooperation are most

The Council includes the eight Arctic States: Norway, Denmark (through
Greenland), Finland, USA (through Alaska), Russia, Canada, Iceland, and
Sweden, as well as several observer states. Notably excluded from the
mandate of [[the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} are any issues that
relate to national or international security. This initiative aimed to
prevent geopolitical tensions from influencing Arctic governance
(Huebert, 2019). Adhering to the agreement subsequently [[led
to]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[25 years of
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} between the involved parties,
eventually giving rise to the term Arctic Exceptionalism.

[Although the decisions of the AC are not legally binding, a majority of
the Arctic States]{.underline} typically [adhere to their
recommendations]{.underline}. Some [[accomplishments stemming from this
cooperation include]{.underline}]{.mark} the Agreement on Cooperation on
Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic in 2013,
and [[the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2017 (Rachold, 2022).

Nevertheless, over the last years, there has been a growing divergence
in opinions regarding the assessment of Arctic Exceptionalism. Some
argue that despite the absence of direct confrontation in the region,
other conflicts are spilling over through a geopolitical context of
increasing tension between America, China, and Russia (Raspotnik and
Osthagen, 2022).

For both America and Russia, the Arctic remains a crucial part of their
military deterrence strategies. Additionally, Russia has long opposed
the expansion of NATO and has been keen to increase its military
presence in the North (Huebert, 2019). For example, in 2007, Russia
resumed its Arctic bomber patrols and built multiple air-defence radar
stations and airfields. In 2012, Vladimir Putin signed a decree to
modernise and revitalise the Russian Navy by 2030, with a special
emphasis on its Northern Fleet(Bott, 2021). As a reaction, America and
NATO are increasingly drawn to the region themselves and have
substantially increased their military activity in the Barents Sea
(Osthagen, 2022). Furthermore, Alaska is home to Fort Greely, America's
largest anti-ballistic missile base and the primary shield against a
nuclear attack (Huebert, 2019).

In the meantime, China has also increased its presence in the High North
and started referring to itself as a "Near-Arctic State" in its 2018
security concept. With the Arctic experiencing an increase in
temperatures that is almost four times as high as the global average
(Rachold, 2022), the melting ice opens up the option for China to
establish a "Polar Silk Route", which would be hugely beneficial to its
economy. Additionally, with China being overly dependent on foreign
countries for its energy supply, the vast amount of untapped natural
resources in the Arctic are of high interest to China.

The Arctic after Russia's invasion of Ukraine

The much appraised High North [[cooperation took
a]{.underline}]{.mark}nother [[severe hit after]{.mark} Russia's
invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in February 2022. [[Most
cooperation with Russia has]{.mark} [been halted, including
the]{.mark}]{.underline} work of the [[Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark} (AC), which Russia had chaired until May
2023. Since there is no legal mechanism to remove Russia from the AC,
any cooperation within the region can only take place outside of the AC,
making overall coordination significantly harder (Landriault et. al.,
2023).

[The [absence of effective communication]{.mark}]{.underline}, coupled
with heightened military activities from both Russia and NATO, has
[[resulted in **escalating tensions**]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. Most notable is the joint Russian and Chinese
military operation just off the coast of Alaska in September 2022. This
not only underscores the growing strain in the region but also
emphasises the deepening cooperation between Russia and China. While all
parties are still carefully avoiding direct military confrontation,
[[there have been]{.mark} multiple occurrences of [hybrid threats, such
as]{.mark} the [sabotaging]{.mark} of [critical infrastructure or
illegal intelligence gathering]{.mark}]{.underline} (Osthagen, 2023).
[[These]{.mark} incidents]{.underline} have always remained under the
threshold of plausible deniability and have therefore not caused any
major crises. They nevertheless [indicate the testing of boundaries and
[are]{.mark} likely [increasing in frequency with a continued lack of
communication]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Furthermore, with the accession of Finland, and soon Sweden, to NATO,
all of the Arctic States except for Russia are now part of the alliance,
creating a direct vis-à-vis frontline between the two sides (Osthagen,
2023). As a result, this strategic context could possibly lead to even
more military activity in the Arctic. In October 2023, during the Arctic
Circle summit, the Chair of the NATO military committee delivered a
speech addressing the significant threat arising from the presence of
Russia and China. He explicitly emphasised the need for preparedness in
the face of potential worst-case scenarios (NATO News, 2023). Coupled
with NATO's recent security concept --- acknowledging Russia's presence
in the High North as a threat for the first time --- it underscores a
noteworthy shift in the perception of [[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Once celebrated as a symbol of intergovernmental cooperation, it now
[[appears to be undergoing a **transformation into a**]{.mark}
**potential [hotspot for conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Experts widely agree that resuming dialogue with Russia is highly
unlikely for the next five to ten years (Landriault et al., 2023). This
sentiment extends not only to the Arctic Council but also encompasses
other forums such as the Arctic Coast Guard Council. The consequences of
this situation, however, extend far beyond the immediate military
concerns faced by the Arctic States. Aside from its geopolitical
significance, the Arctic plays a crucial role in scientific research on
climate change due to being an exceptionally sensitive region to rising
temperatures and melting ice (Rachold, 2022). [[The discontinuation of
collaboration between scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and
environmentalists [[with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, which possesses
the largest share of Arctic land among all the Arctic States, [poses an
obstacle to scientific progress]{.underline} on climate change. [This
disruption]{.underline} not only impacts the inhabitants of the region
but also [[has far-reaching consequences globally]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Without Russian data, it becomes virtually impossible to comprehensively
assess the full scale of environmental effects in the Arctic.

Conclusion

The era of Arctic Exceptionalism and its once-praised
[[intergovernmental cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} is undeniably over.
It [[has been replaced by heightened military activities and hybrid
threats. Geopolitical tensions have surged]{.mark}]{.underline} not only
[[between NATO and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} but also between the
United States and China. Against this backdrop[, prospects for improved
regional relationships in the coming years are bleak.]{.underline}

While the decision to sever ties with Russia in various forums,
especially within the Arctic Circle, is justifiable given the unjust war
it wages, it is important to acknowledge the potential long-term
repercussions. [[Ceasing communication]{.mark} not only [increases the
likelihood of **small incidents escalating**]{.mark} but also obstructs
scientific progress]{.underline} on climate change. Such a setback could
have lasting consequences for both local inhabitants and the global
community alike.

Therefore, [[it is crucial to use the already established forums for
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [[to address
this]{.underline}]{.mark} dilemma. While the swift resumption of
collaboration with Russia is unlikely, it is worth noting that the
Arctic was once a symbol of successful international cooperation and
still harbours the potential to become one once again. This undertaking
presents significant challenges for all parties involved, but the
consequences of not succeeding could be even more adverse.

#### It causes miscalculation and nuclear war

//DH

Long gone are the days of "duck and cover" drills and fallout shelters
in America, when the fears of nuclear war were on the minds of most.
[For decades]{.underline}, cooler heads prevailed, and [the U.S. and
Russia worked cooperatively to reduce the risk of nuclear
conflict]{.underline} and decrease the size of their arsenals. [[By
2022, cooperation began disintegrating]{.mark} as Russia's botched
invasion of Ukraine raised serious concerns about nuclear
escalation]{.underline} and severely hampered the prospects of future
nuclear arms control agreements. With Russia seemingly dismissing the
Trump administration's rather conciliatory efforts to end the war, there
appears to be no end in sight, and Europe is feeling the pressure,
embarking on a massive effort to boost its own defense.

[[Amidst]{.mark} these [tensions]{.mark}, [melting polar ice is opening
Arctic sea lanes to increased shipping traffic, resource exploration,
and military posturing]{.mark}.]{.underline} NATO's newest members,
Finland and Sweden, are Arctic nations. Russia currently dominates the
Arctic region, holding 53% of its total coastline, operating the world's
biggest icebreaker fleet, and has been upgrading its Arctic military
bases. China is also increasingly playing a role, conducting joint
Arctic military exercises with Russia and employing an icebreaker fleet
of its own, despite its complete lack of territory in the Arctic Circle.

But [is the Arctic destined to be the most likely flashpoint for a
nuclear war?]{.underline} Let's look at the possibilities.

Despite being so cold, the Arctic is no stranger to military conflict,
holding major strategic value and serving as a passageway to both the
Atlantic and Pacific. During World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic
extended into the Arctic and ships carrying American war supplies to the
Soviet Union traversed the Northern Sea Route. Germany invaded Norway,
and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War of 1940. As the
Cold War evolved, the Arctic became a major theater for submarine
activity.

Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland "one way or
the other" highlights the growing importance of the Arctic to the
security interests of the United States. Greenland's geographic
location, combined with the U.S.' operation of Pituffik Space Base in
the high north, provides key "missile warning, missile defense, and
space surveillance" capabilities. [The shortest flight paths for nuclear
missiles between the U.S. and Russia exist over the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}, and the loss of this base on account of a diplomatic
blunder could open a key blind spot in America's strategic defense.
Alternatively, the loss of this base to a Russian attack aimed at
disabling American missile detection infrastructure is unlikely due to
the danger of immediate retaliation and escalation.

Currently, [[the most likely path to a]{.mark} potential [**nuclear
exchange in the Arctic** would be through a]{.mark} conventional or
"[gray zone" Russian attack on a NATO member]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Border skirmishes, cyber-attacks, airspace incursions, reckless
military intercepts, and support to separatist groups]{.mark}
intentionally [sit in the "gray zone]{.mark}" between peace and outright
war, [but could]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [[lead to open conflict
that **escalates to nuclear war**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Conceivably, a
gray zone or overt attack on other Greelandic infrastructure, or an
information operations campaign aimed at dividing the U.S., Greenland,
and Denmark, are not outside of the realm of possibility.

[With NATO's addition of Sweden and]{.underline}, more importantly,
[Finland]{.underline}---which shares a 1,343 km border with
Russia---[there is increased opportunity that a NATO Arctic state could
be attacked]{.underline}. Highlighting this risk, American forces in
Alaska recently staged a drill in which hundreds of troops were flown to
Finland to defend against a mock Russian invasion. Yet rather than an
overt invasion of a NATO member, [[Russia]{.mark} is far more [likely
test the waters by conducting]{.mark} provocative and [destabilizing
small-scale gray zone activities]{.mark}.]{.underline} The disastrous
results of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in
Moscow about its ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on
a nuclear armed country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct
attack unlikely. It is not entirely clear where the red line on gray
zone activities would be for Finland or what would trigger an Article 5
collective defense declaration short of a direct attack across the
border.

Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter a
Russian attack on the European NATO members, President Trump's many
public pronouncements expressing doubt about his willingness to defend a
NATO member that comes under attack has shaken confidence in Europe
about America's commitment. As a result, France and the UK are
considering expanding their arsenals, signifying an increased reliance
on nuclear posturing for deterrence, including for the defense of Arctic
NATO members. France is reconsidering whether it wants to decommission
its current warheads as it brings replacements online, potentially
doubling of the size of its arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an
airbase closer to the German border to be able to host nuclear weapons.
The UK, which has been historically dependent on the U.S. for its
nuclear arsenal, is recently questioning that dependence, and may seek
other options to assure an effective and reliable deterrent. This could
foretell a new nuclear arms race.

The upcoming February 2026 expiration of New START, the last remaining
strategic nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, portends a
period of nuclear proliferation that could echo the nuclear arms
buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile, China, which has been operating in
the Arctic, has been engaging in its own rapid nuclear buildup in an
effort to potentially exceed 1,000 warheads by 2035. China has
consistently rejected efforts to join a multilateral nuclear arms
reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia, citing its comparatively much
smaller nuclear arsenal.

[[Navigation issues in the Arctic could]{.mark} also [lead to military
escalations **reaching the nuclear level**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The
Global Navigation Satellite System]{.underline}]{.mark} (GNSS), which
includes satellite constellations like the American GPS system or
Russian GLONASS, [[sees decreased reliability and accuracy in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. The reasons for this are abundant, like the
orbital inclination of the satellites themselves and ionospheric
interference. [[With]{.mark} increased incidents of [Russian GNSS
jamming in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, it's conceivable that [[Russia
may employ similar tactics in the Arctic,]{.mark} including spoofing,
[for the purpose of disruption or causing navigational errors to trigger
an exploitable international incident]{.mark}]{.underline}. Military or
civilian vessels straying into Russian territory could be captured,
their cargoes seized, or crews held hostage for the purpose of
conducting hostage diplomacy. Resolving [such [a
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline} military [[could **quickly spiral out
of control**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Yet considering these combined factors, [[the Arctic does not exist in a
vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear tensions are
rising]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the most likely scenario
for a direct confrontation between the United States and another nuclear
power. Though he has not signaled any specific intent to attack,
President Xi aims for the Chinese military to be capable of invading
Taiwan by 2027. While President Biden indicated his intention to
directly aid Taiwan if this occurred, President Trump appears to defer
to the traditional American position of strategic ambiguity over the
island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S. responds to defend
Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to detonate a nuclear
weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten the U.S. mainland
or a NATO ally. On the other hand, a subsequent attack on Chinese
mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking Chinese
invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response.

What is most concerning is that [[provocative military behavior anywhere
could lead to an unintentional cycle of escalation that]{.mark}
ultimately [**results in a nuclear exchange**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[As
the Arctic opens to more military and commercial activity, the frequency
of encounters between military forces is likely to
increase]{.underline}]{.mark}. [As those encounters increase, [so too
does the probability that an **accident** or **unintended
attack**]{.mark} [may occur]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Russia routinely
flies patrols into the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone, an area
of international air space in which the U.S. identifies all aircraft,
aggressive behavior by Russian pilots raises the risk of a routine
encounter evolving into an international incident. But these aggressive
incidents are much more frequent elsewhere, like the Baltic and North
Seas. For example, in 2022, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet fired two
missiles against a British RC-135 surveillance jet over the Black Sea,
but fortunately neither missile hit their target. Similarly, China is
known for conducting frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign aircraft in
the East and South China Seas.

In the end, the likeliness that the Arctic or any other region sees the
confrontation leading to nuclear war is more about the actors involved
and the choices they make rather than the regions themselves. [[Actors
committed to]{.mark} the [peaceful resolution of disputes will]{.mark}
find ways to [preserve that peace]{.mark}. [Yet in an era of]{.mark}
machismo, [confrontation]{.mark}, and conquest, [we could all find
ourselves walking off a dangerous cliff from which there is no
return]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[unless we can reverse]{.mark} some of what]{.underline} the

#### The plan uses the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation to restore relations and reduce fragmentation

Today, [[the Arctic Council is the central forum]{.mark} through which
the eight Arctic states promote inter-state cooperation [for
environmental protection]{.mark} and sustainable
development]{.underline}. Environmental protection and sustainable
development in the Arctic call for a governance framework in which
scientific findings translate into legal norms. The Arctic Climate
Impact Assessment (ACIA), an Arctic Council initiative carried out in
2004/5 and one of the first studies of its kind, represents a
ground-breaking work.5 It has provided evidence-based information on
changes in the Arctic, including the impacts of climate change, and has
implications for societies, both within and beyond the region. [[The
Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, through its six Working Groups,
[[produces science-based knowledge and assessment reports]{.mark} that
shape policies for Arctic states and other stakeholders and serve to
enhance systematic collaboration]{.underline}. Importantly, the
Council's endorsement of the reports, findings, and subsequent policy
recommendations produced through the political decision-making process
takes on the status of "soft law."6 Although not strictly legally
binding, soft law is crucial in setting standards and shaping the
behavior of state and non-state actors. While the Arctic model for
cooperation reflects the search for practicable solutions to Arctic
problems, today many non-Arctic countries worldwide have embraced values
that the Arctic Council promotes, and participate as observers in the
Council-led governance framework. Over the years, the Council's efforts
have been widely recognized as a successful model for inter-governmental
cooperation.

Significantly, [[this science-based approach to cooperation]{.mark} has
also [led to the establishment of formal legal
mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [[the Arctic states
adopted a set of legally binding instruments under the auspices of the
Arctic Council]{.mark},]{.underline} with these primarily based in
assessment reports and findings produced by the Council in response to
the most urgent Arctic problems. The Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement
of 2011,7 the Arctic Oil Spill Agreement of 2013,8 and [[the Agreement
on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [of 2017]{.underline} 9 are successful
examples. They have [[served to shape an even stronger cooperation
model]{.mark} among the Arctic nations, one relying on and promoting a
coordinated approach and legal commitmen]{.underline}t. Additionally,
the Arctic coastal states, along with some of the Council's non-Arctic
observer states and the European Union (also an observer), adopted the
Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement in 2018 (entered into force in
2020),10 which prohibits unregulated fishing as long as there is no
scientific data available that would ensure the feasibility of
sustainable fishing in an area. The Agreement is driven by the
precautionary principle; that is, it avoids potential harm to the Arctic
ecosystem given that comprehensive knowledge is lacking on whether or
not sustainable fisheries resources are available. What is more notable
is that the Agreement recognizes the value of Indigenous knowledge and
of incorporating this into understanding ecosystem behavior. Moreover,
by including Indigenous peoples in the negotiation process and
incorporating their voices in the law-making process, the Council has
further acknowledged Indigenous peoples as legitimate actors in the
Arctic governance framework. These examples indicate how a science-based
framework supplemented by evidence-based Indigenous knowledge systems
has greatly enhanced -- and will continue to enhance -- regulatory norms
for a transnational governance framework applicable to the Arctic.

[The Arctic governance framework]{.underline} soon [became a model
arguing for value-based cooperation among nations in other areas of
Arctic politics]{.underline}, despite prevailing challenges. The
[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} has long been persuasively described
as "Arctic exceptionalism."11 The obsession with "Arctic
exceptionalism," although shaken slightly after Russia's invasion of
Crimea in 2014, [[continued until Russia launched a]{.underline}]{.mark}
full-scale [[invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in early 2022. In
response, [seven of the eight members of the Arctic Council paused
cooperation with Russia; the Council's activities literally came to a
standstil]{.underline}l. It should be noted that Russia was its Chair at
the time. Although Norway took over the Chairship in 2023 from Russia,
no official communication with Russia has resumed. Russia's not
participating complicates the functioning of the Arctic Council in its
existing form, as the Ottawa Declaration provides that all decisions of
the Council are to be consensus-based.12 In one symptom of the delicate
relationship between Russia on one side, and the seven other Council
members on the other, in February of this year (2024) Russia threatened
to withdraw from the Arctic Council if its work did not align with the
country's interests.13

The current institutional framework of the Arctic Council ceased to
exist without Russia, although a new form might take shape among the
seven Western Arctic states. However, with the prevailing atmosphere,
the obsession with "Arctic exceptionalism" has literally come to an end.
In fact, one might question whether cooperation as built in the Arctic
constituted "exceptionalism" in the first place untouched by global
power politics. Although the Arctic cooperation model incorporates
fundamental environmental values, such as protecting the environment and
promoting sustainable development, Arctic governance cannot be separated
from the global political ecosystem; in particular, it must take into
account the great power game, inasmuch as the Arctic states include two
major superpowers -- Russia and the United States. A wide range of
tensions now weigh upon the Arctic cooperation model: Russia's ambitions
to remain a player -- or regain its prominence -- in global power
politics, China's growing presence in Arctic affairs, competition among
the great powers, as well as the expansion of NATO to include all the
Arctic countries (but Russia) and the consequences for the dynamics of
the power balance.

Although the mandate of the Arctic Council is limited to cooperation
related to environmental matters, thus excluding issues of "military
security",14 the concept of security has been transformed, particularly
since the end of the Cold War. The root causes of insecurity
increasingly stemmed from non-military threats that have placed the
human security agenda at the forefront of the Arctic cooperation
framework. For example, the motivation for the Search and Rescue
Agreement -- the first Arctic-specific international legal instrument
concluded under the auspices of the Arctic Council -- is to promote
coordination among the Arctic states to effectively respond to
emergencies in Arctic conditions. The particular challenges facing
rescue operations in the region include remote locations, harsh weather
conditions, long darkness during the winter months and operational
challenges linked to the impacts of climate change, such as thinning of
the sea ice.

Security concerns stemming from the risks associated with the Arctic's
environmental changes and the divides in the political arena between the
West and Russia---the latter controlling over half of the Arctic---will
likely remain despite the virtual resumption of Arctic Council meetings
at the working group level. The absence of data from and on the Russian
Arctic on permafrost thaw, wildfires, polar bears, and transforming
ecosystems will hamper efforts to accumulate comprehensive collective
knowledge on the Arctic change; a particular liability will be the lack
of coordinated Arctic research on the risks posed by climate change.15
It would appear that resuming effective science cooperation with Russia
within the Arctic Council framework will not be possible in the
foreseeable future. This said, however, international governance
regimes, applicable to the Arctic, such as those concerned with climate
change, the law of the sea, regulations on maritime shipping, and
activities of the IMO, will proceed along their conventional routes.
Although Russia threatened to withdraw from the UNCLOS in the Arctic at
the beginning of 2024, this was probably no more than a tactic to
attract attention in the face of diminishing partnerships in the Arctic.
In the end, Russia's potential withdrawal from the UNCLOS would be
pointless, given that such an action might not better serve any
interests of Russia. It also merits mention that within the framework of
the Central Arctic Ocean fisheries agreement Russia participated in the
first in-person meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which
took place in November 2022. At the meeting the CoP Rules of Procedure
was adopted by consensus, reflecting Russia's continued engagement in
the international legal framework despite the prevailing anxiety and
tension.16 Moreover, [despite ongoing turmoil, bilateral cooperation has
continued between Russia and the Arctic states on many
occasions]{.underline}. For example, Norway collaborates with Russia on
fisheries and maritime border issues in the Barents Sea and coast guard
rescue operations. Similar initiatives exist between Russia and the
United States. [Examples are the continuation of the respective coast
guards\' line of communication on both sides of the Bering
Strait]{.underline} to protect people and marine resources and the
commitment to enduring agreements on search and rescue and emergency
operations, although joint exercises are currently on hold.17

In sum, [[the role of science diplomacy in translating science-based
knowledge into a regulatory framework is crucial for Arctic
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}. The law is often an inflexible tool for
an adjustment in response to the dynamics of changes. [This highlights
the Arctic Council's role in formulating reflexive assessment and policy
tools with recommendations constituting soft law,]{.underline} often
found authoritative for an effective governance mechanism. [[Without
Russia's engagement, the production of Arctic science within the Arctic
Council processes will become **fragmented** and
**uncoordinated**]{.mark},]{.underline} eventually ch[allenging efforts
to build the comprehensive knowledge framework]{.underline} essential
for a uniform approach to understanding Arctic science. [[Given the
uncertainty of the full resumption of Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in its customary form as per the Ottawa
Declaration[, [it is crucial to explore]{.underline}]{.mark} [avenues to
develop a framework for [science cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} that
is [[removed from political antagonism. This]{.underline}]{.mark}
undertaking [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[be built around the
Arctic Scientific Cooperation Agreement]{.mark} of 2017, adopted by the
Arctic countries **[under the auspices of the Arctic
Council]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Indeed, while Trump has yet to deliver the swift peace in Ukraine he

said. [For any of this to be plausible, the risks would have to be
manageable --- and]{.underline} right now, Moe said, "[long-term
investments in Russia look quite risky]{.underline} because the economic
\[and\] political situation is unpredictable."

[Even if sanctions were lifted, "American companies don't seem
particularly eager to return to the Russian market right
now,"]{.underline} Shumanov concurred. There's also the matter of
nationalization, which the Kremlin has been actively using to seize
foreign-owned assets since the full-scale war began. As Shumanov put it,
when Trump leaves office, "Vladimir Putin, if the mood strikes him,
could easily sign another decree nationalizing the next enterprise."

With joint business ventures still difficult to justify --- and military
cooperation all but unimaginable --- Shumanov believes [[the most
realistic area for]{.mark} actual [engagement is environmental
science]{.mark}]{.underline}[. "[Joint climate
research]{.underline}]{.mark}, coordination, disaster prevention ---
that kind of collaboration [**[could start tomorrow]{.underline}**,
[even with major political differences]{.underline}]{.mark}," he told
Meduza. "[[Russian and American scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and
climate experts [**[could meet through Arctic Council working
groups]{.underline}** [and begin working together]{.underline}."]{.mark}

The [Arctic Council]{.underline} --- an intergovernmental forum focused
on scientific and environmental cooperation --- has managed to survive
not only Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine but also Finland and
Sweden's accession to NATO, which left Russia the lone non-NATO country
in the Arctic Circle. "It was almost on its deathbed," Moe said, "but it
seems that all parties wanted it to remain."

Still, he said, "the level of contact and [[cooperation within that
framework is at a very low level today]{.underline}]{.mark}" --- though
he acknowledged that international interest coupled with concern for the
region's vulnerability could lead to renewed cooperation.

#### Limited science cooperation exists now in tandem with sanctions. Expanding it to climate data builds trust and de-escalates conflict

Restoring Cooperation

Two years into the war in Ukraine, [[there are some headways in
Russia-West Arctic cooperation]{.underline}. [Norway took
over]{.underline}]{.mark} the chair of [[the Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2023 [[and is gradually resuming work
with Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In February 2024, the council announced that official meetings of
project and expert working groups will resume in a digital format. A
month before, [[Norway's chief Arctic official,]{.underline}]{.mark}
Morten Høglund, [[met in person with]{.underline}]{.mark} the six
Indigenous peoples' organizations, including [[two representatives from
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Norway's relationship]{.underline}]{.mark} with Russia [[can serve as
an example]{.underline}]{.mark} for dealing with Russia under the
current political circumstances. In recent years[[, Norway has imposed
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} against Russia, signed a bilateral
defense agreement with the United States, and hosted NATO troops in the
largest military exercise since the Cold War. [[At the same time, Norway
continues collaboration with Russia to comanage fisheries in the Barents
Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Norwegian-Russian border, [[and Coast
Guard rescue]{.underline}]{.mark} operations.

Similarly[, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[maintains some]{.mark} channels of
[cooperation with Russia in the Arctic]{.mark}, especially [in the
Bering Strait]{.mark}. The US and Russian Coast Guards maintain lines of
communication to protect people and marine resources on both sides of
the strait]{.underline}. While joint exercises have been on hold, [the
US and Russian Coast Guards still commit to the enduring agreements on
search-and-rescue and emergency operations]{.underline}. [Cooperation
continues even against the background of provocative Russian naval
exercises off the coast of Alaska]{.underline}.

Moreover, [there is collaboration at the individual and informal levels.
Some academic conferences in the US and Russia, where scientists share
research on Arctic natural and social sciences, still involve Russian
and American researchers]{.underline}. Such developments demonstrate
that [[while relations may have been mostly severed, there are still
narrow openings for cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [[around issues
that are seen as essential]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Lessons from History

Despite the stark challenges of reigniting full-fledged cooperation
today, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and Russia have a **long history of polar science cooperation** and
diplomacy over common interests during times of geopolitical
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[During the Cold War, American and Russian researchers engaged in
numerous scientific exchanges]{.underline}]{.mark} and joined dozens of
countries to study sea ice, aurora borealis and polar meteorology as
part of the 1957--58 International Geophysical Year. In the 1970s, the
US and USSR signed landmark agreements on environmental protection and
polar bear conservation.

At the end of the Cold War, [[the cooperation between Soviet and Western
Arctic scientists built interstate trust and **spilled over** into the
political and military spheres]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a famous 1987
speech in northern Russia, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev recognized
that "the community and interrelationship of the interests of our entire
world is felt in the Arctic, perhaps more than anywhere else," and that
"scientific exploration of the Arctic is of immense importance for the
whole of mankind." Gorbachev's ruminations went on to inspire the 1996
formation of the Arctic Council.

After the Cold War, US-Russia Arctic cooperation skyrocketed as Western
researchers poured into the previously inaccessible Russian Arctic.
Notable collaborations include the Russian-American Long-term Census of
the Arctic (RUSALCA, which means "mermaid" in Russian). Across several
expeditions to the Bering and Chukchi Seas between 2004 and 2015,
Russian and American scientists jointly studied marine chemistry,
glaciology, oceanography, and ecosystems.

RUSALCA existed "as a miracle," according to its participants, because
of initial opposition from Russian and American security services. The
project continued against the background of political tensions related
to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War and 2014 Ukraine crisis. Such examples
offer practical examples for common-interest cooperation despite steep
political disagreements.

Today, [[climate science has fallen victim to]{.mark} the diplomatic
fallout of the [war in Ukraine]{.mark}. [Nonetheless, there remains
significant]{.mark} and ongoing [support from international
scientists]{.mark} and Arctic residents [for Moscow and Washington
to]{.mark} find a common understanding in [study]{.mark}ing and tackling
[the Arctic climate crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Scientific cooperation]{.mark}, an [essential]{.mark} endeavor [for
the world's **survival**, can help **build trust** between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia, and **prevent a
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a region that has not seen interstate
violence since World War II.

#### It [spills over]{.underline} into [other]{.underline} areas of US-Russian disagreement and bolsters diplomacy broadly

[[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, warming four times faster than the
rest of the world, [[may be the key region for the US and Russia to
advance cooperation]{.mark}. US-Russia [rapprochement may]{.mark}
broadly benefit the world by bringing an [end]{.mark} to [the]{.mark}
disastrous [war in Ukraine and reduc]{.mark}ing [the risk of nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [[existential environmental
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[demand
attention.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. [[It is now the task]{.underline}]{.mark} of civil society
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} elevate climate change as a concern and
[[pressure the two countries to include climate change in the Arctic
cooperation agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
[Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region
as a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We need to pursue
joint projects]{.underline}, including, for example, [in the Arctic."
The Arctic region makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the two
sides have explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in
energy, investment, and geopolitical issues.]{.underline} [Western
sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the
Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and]{.underline} grand plans
for [Arctic shipping]{.underline}. [US officials now see Arctic
cooperation as a potential means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline}.

[[In my meetings]{.mark}]{.underline} in Moscow [[with American and
Russian diplomats]{.mark}]{.underline} and businessmen over the past few
weeks, it is clear that [[many are interested in]{.mark} diverse forms
of Arctic cooperation]{.underline}, from cultural diplomacy that
celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the
Bering Strait, to [[scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to
climate hazards]{.underline}]{.mark} faced by both nations. Business
interests, however, are at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that [rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview]{.underline}.
Greenland has large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically
positioned alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits.
[Putin's offer to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration
with the US may]{.underline} also [have implications for Arctic
cooperation.]{.underline}

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [By making it easier to issue visas and travel
between the two countries, Americans and Russians will again be able to
conduct joint research, expeditions, and scientific
conferences]{.underline} and build models to better understand the
unfolding climate emergency. [[Scientific cooperation to
understand]{.mark} the changes affecting sea ice,
**[permafrost,]{.mark}** ecosystems, and local communities [has been
blunted by the political fallout of the war in
Ukraine.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Cooperation in the Arctic can help build regional
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. More importantly, [[Arctic cooperation
will build trust between the US and Russia that
could]{.mark}]{.underline} complement or [[**spill over into other
crucial fields** of cooperation such as **arms control**, Middle East
peace, and global health]{.underline}]{.mark}.

//DH

The fourth industrial revolution

[[The global tech]{.mark}nological [landscape is being
transformed]{.mark} and disrupted [by the]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called
[[fourth industrial revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example
[[with]{.mark} near-daily advances in [AI]{.mark}]{.underline},
information technology, [[quantum]{.mark} tech]{.underline}nologies,
robotics, [[autonomous systems, space]{.mark} t]{.underline}echnologies,
genomics, [[and genetic engineering]{.underline}]{.mark}. These
technologies have impacted: international scientific collaboration,
which can take place more easily with advanced communication
technologies; the intelligence community, which uses social media to
monitor people's activities or influence political opinion; and
diplomacy itself, by enabling government officials to work directly with
their international counterparts and sometimes to bypass or
'disintermediate' the diplomats who previously served as their
go-betweens.

These technological developments and [[their rapid exploitation have
made **science even more critical**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
increasingly urgent drive by national governments to deliver economic
growth and international competitiveness. This is reflected in calls for
R&D investment, more interventionist industrial and trade strategies,
and shifting relationships amongst governments, regulators, and wealthy
corporate actors. Examples include the privatisation of space
exploration and the role of vaccine producers in influencing the extent
of global access to life-saving vaccines. [[In]{.mark} setting foreign
[policy priorities relating]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} economic growth, critical and [[emerging
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies, [and resilient access to scarce
resources, [governments need to cultivate close relations
with]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[the research
community]{.underline}]{.mark} and the commercial deployers of science
in the economy.

This raises an important side question about the level and affordability
of scientific skills in the public sector. [[Science has]{.mark} also
[assumed a critical role in]{.mark} the emergence of new threats to
security, including [cyber threats to critical
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, [growing
misinformation]{.underline}28, and increasing concern over how
international scientific collaboration may be exploited for military
purposes or illicit technology transfer.

[This had led to]{.underline} new and rapidly [[emerging
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [being the subject of increased global
competition, both economic and military.]{.underline} [The pace of this
technological [development is so rapid that regulators]{.mark} and
analysts [struggle to keep up]{.mark}]{.underline}, and global
inequalities are exacerbated. This widened range of stakeholders and the
ease of technological transfer (both lawful and unlawful) also limit the
ability of states to protect sovereign advantage. Finally, there has
been extraordinary growth by a small number of massive global technology
companies whose economic strength and international influence exceed
those of many nation-states. Their scale and global footprint make them
'supranational' entities.

Geopolitics

[The geopolitical context of today is increasingly adversarial,
fragmented, and contested. Power is more widely
distribute]{.underline}d, and today's influential states have less in
common with each other, both in general terms and in terms of shared
values. A key tension at the heart of this is the increasingly
antagonistic relationship between the US and China, resulting from the
growth of China's political and economic power and profound shifts in
US politics.

[[The world]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[is also more dangerous, with
major wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Sudan]{.mark}.]{.underline}
These conflicts and others have further polarised global politics and
adversely impacted regional and global science. The fallout from these
wars has severely impacted academia and research along with all other
aspects of life in these regions29. The other area where change has been
most evident is in relationships with Russia, after Western institutions
halted scientific partnerships with the country in response to its
invasion of Ukraine in February 202230.

[Diminished political will to collaborate has also weakened multilateral
institutions and initiatives promoting collective endeavours on issues
such as climate, health, and trade.]{.underline} In many countries this
is a result of an increasingly polarised and partisan domestic political
climate, fuelled partly by social media, which has seen scientists
forced to fight a rearguard action against misinformation31.

International collaboration is therefore becoming more common among
like-minded countries or politically aligned groups, such as the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the G7,
BRICS, the European Union (sometimes including some of its neighbours),
and the 'Five Eyes'. However, this is not just a case of competition
between like-minded blocs, some of which may have different value
systems. There is also the potential for further fragmentation within
these groups. Recent political developments in the US, UK, and EU have
highlighted the potential for greater policy divergence and competition,
even between ostensible allies.

Indeed, international scientific collaboration itself, once seen as an
unalloyed good, is now coming under greater scrutiny to ensure that its
benefits are spread evenly. Researchers in the Global South are
increasingly calling for fairer recognition of their contributions to
global science in the form of more equitable partnerships32 and fairer
research collaborations33. Meanwhile policymakers in the Global North
are increasingly focused on threats to their research from collaborators
who transfer technology from them for free, or who use it for purposes
that are hostile to their interests.

While there are serious economic and national security implications in
the case of the theft or misuse of intellectual property, today's more
multipolar world can also provide opportunities. The more even
distribution of power has led to a much greater variety of scientific
nations from all areas of the world, in particular the Global South, and
to an increasing global distribution of high-quality scientific
research.

All [these environmental, demographic, [technological, and geopolitical
changes are]{.mark}]{.underline} interacting in unexpected ways.
Sometimes these developments have positive impacts, not least in how
they have enabled a greater number and range of voices, countries, and
institutions to be represented in global science and science diplomacy.
Other developments are more challenging[, [leading to]{.mark} greater
global unrest, [rising nationalism]{.mark} and populism,]{.underline}
and potentially a more difficult environment for scientists who find
themselves caught in the crosscurrents of increasingly polarised
politics

This analysis illustrates that the more optimistic age in which the 2010
science diplomacy report was published is over. [[This
means]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**the practice of [science diplomacy is
more important than ever.]{.mark}** [A more complex]{.mark}, fragile,
[and contested global landscape brings]{.mark} with it a growing variety
and intensity of [problems that require robust scientific evidence to
inform the diplomacy needed to address them]{.mark}]{.underline}. To do
so, the practice of science diplomacy must evolve accordingly.

In recent decades, [these regimes have come under steadily increasing
pressure.]{.underline} Politicized obstacles to the fight against
COVID-19 have cost hundreds of thousands of lives. [[Arms control and
nonproliferation agreements]{.underline} [that]{.underline}]{.mark} have
reduced the number and [[limited]{.mark} the spread of [nuclear weapons
have been]{.mark} slowly [undermined or dismantled]{.mark}, and
countries are pushing against the relatively few restrictions that
remain. Efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions are falling far short
of what is needed to prevent catastrophic global warming]{.underline}
within the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren. Jobs lost from
technological changes in manufacturing and services have stimulated a
backlash against globalization and the rise of a brand of populism that
is hostile to expertise and governance. The resulting revival of
protectionism and economic nationalism threatens the trade regime that
has brought prosperity and technical progress to much of the world.

[We are]{.underline} needlessly [allowing technology to take the world
to the brink of disasters from accidental climate disruption, nuclear
war, and pandemics]{.underline}---at the same time that we are allowing
the means for controlling these technologies to erode. In effect, [we
are edging closer and closer to cliffs from which we have removed the
guardrails]{.underline}. Fortunately, people are beginning to
develop---or at least to think about---protections against some of these
dangers.

A technology-based model of authoritarian government is being promoted
and exported as a technological, economic, and political challenge to
Western liberal democracies. The Internet and social media, conceived as
vehicles for free exchange of information and platforms for untrammeled
innovation, in some countries have become instruments of repression. At
the same time, a systematic, worldwide campaign of misinformation and
disinformation, spread via social and mass media, has deliberately sown
distrust in the democratic process, in government, in international
institutions, in science, in expertise of all kinds, and in the very
idea that there is such a thing as truth. In the United States, the
scientific consensus concerning climate change has been overwhelmed by
misinformation and disinformation spread by political and business
interests that it threatens, while public messaging regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic has been at best mixed. All this has made it difficult
for people to understand the complex and dangerous new threats to the
environment, to their health, to their security, and to democratic
government.

Stimulating and Guiding Technological Change

Science and technology have much to contribute to the resolution of all
these issues. [We need better scientific understanding of the climate,
of the ways in which diseases spread, and of the likely impact of gene
drivers and geoengineering.]{.underline} We need technological
innovations to prevent or cure non-communicable diseases, alleviate
malnutrition, conserve resources, defend against cyberattack, and
restructure our economies along more sustainable and equitable
[lines]{.underline}.

But we cannot depend on science and technology to address these issues
on their own. We also need policies and institutions that not only
support research and encourage technological innovation but also guide
scientific research and technological change in responsible directions.
[This will require]{.underline} [both "top-down" measures by national
governments and "bottom-up" pressures from]{.underline} public opinion,
from [nongovernmental organizations]{.underline} (NGOs) and from state
and local governments that are often more directly responsive to public
pressure. It will need ideas and inspiration from businesses,
[universities, research institutes]{.underline}, individual inventors,
and ordinary citizens, and support from public opinion and from the
actions and advocacy of individuals and communities. In some cases, it
will require sustained effort to resist commercial, political, and
military pressures to ignore broader social and environmental problems
when investing in research and innovation and to deploy technologies
before at least some of their consequences are understood and
anticipated. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the denial of the
reality of climate change in a number of countries show how even the
best scientific advice can be undercut by the words and actions of
shortsighted, self-interested political leaders.

[[We need]{.mark} to devise [limits on tech]{.mark}nological
[innovations like autonomous weapons and hypersonic missiles that can
lead to **unintended nuclear war.**]{.mark}]{.underline} We need to
restructure our economy and redesign our cities to end, or at least to
limit the use of fossil fuels and to increase the efficiency of our use
of energy and materials. [[We need controls on]{.mark} technologies like
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence, [gene drivers, and
geoengineering, all of which both promise major benefits and involve
great risks]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We need to defend ourselves
against technology-based attacks on the values of freedom of thought,
communication, innovation, and access to information that were embodied
in the original design of the Internet and social media but are now
under attack.

At the same time, [we need new science and technology to develop novel
approaches to environmental sustainability: improved sources of
renewable energy and innovative approaches to efficient energy
use]{.underline}. [We need both to expand and to restructure our
electric energy grids to electrify our economy]{.underline} and to
improve their efficiency, reliability, and security. We need to
restructure our agricultural economy, our urban infrastructure and our
transportation systems. We need explicit measures to ensure that
everyone can participate in the benefits of technological change. We
need research and development on orphan technologies, and vaccines and
cures for the diseases that mainly affect people in low-income
countries. Not a small menu.

Some of these issues, like [climate change, nuclear weapons, and global
health]{.underline}, [are governed by long-standing regimes, norms, and
institutions that now need strengthening and refurbishing to meet new
political, economic, and technological challenges. [Nonproliferation and
anti-missile agreements need to be restored and extended to limit or ban
development and deployment of hypersonic missiles, destabilizing
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} that are now [[under rapid
development]{.underline}]{.mark} in many countries. Voluntary national
limits on greenhouse gas emissions need to be urgently increased. Time
is running out, and costs will be much greater the longer we take for
effective action to mitigate and adapt to climate disruption. In the
global health sphere, the system for emergency preparedness and pandemic
control needs increased and sustained political and financial support to
replace the long-standing pattern of crisis-to-crisis, feast-or-famine
funding. Most low-income countries still need basic health
infrastructure, both to provide health services to their population and
to identify and control epidemic disease that could spread beyond their
borders.

[[Cyberweapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [can quickly get out of
control and [wreak enormous damage on critical infrastructure]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} the systems [of command-and-control on which we would
depend to **prevent accidental escalation of a localized conflict to
full-scale war.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Like hypersonic missiles, the
response to these weapons depends on artificial intelligence. Unlike
hypersonic missiles, cyberweapons do not lend themselves to the type of
verifiable arms control regime that has so far been successful for
nuclear weapons. What is more, many governments oppose any limits on the
use of cyberweapons, despite the risk they pose of accidental
escalation. [[Continued research and international discussion on how
these weapons can be controlled are urgent]{.mark}
priorities]{.underline}.

[Geoengineering and gene drivers also take the world into uncharted
territory]{.underline}. Their governance is complicated by the fact that
they are accessible not only to governments, but also to private
businesses, NGOs, and individuals. It is far from clear how decisions
should be made as to whether and under what circumstances these
technologies should be developed, and what criteria should govern any
such decisions. Advocates for these technologies have developed roadmaps
for deploying them in a way that minimizes risks. Still, there are
fundamental disagreements over whether geoengineering and gene drivers
should be developed and implemented at all, and there is substantial
support for the idea that one or both should be banned outright. Critics
have called for moratoriums until the broader questions can be explored
by a broad range of worldwide stakeholders, disciplines, and cultures.
However, the disagreements we have outlined will probably never be
totally resolved to everyone's satisfaction, and deployment decisions
will eventually have to be made one way or the other.

The governance of the Internet and social media involves measures to
preserve the global Internet and to address those issues of
cybersecurity that are of common concern to countries with very
different political systems and very different ideas concerning civil
liberties and human rights. The competition between authoritarian and
democratic governments over freedom of information and innovation is
likely to go on for a long time, but both sides have a strong interest
in maintaining a functioning global Internet and in avoiding
catastrophic damage to information and telecommunication systems.

Several academies of science, research institutes, NGOs, and religious
organizations have proposed codes of conduct and declarations of
principle to deal with the difficult philosophical, ethical, and
practical issues involved in all these issues. These represent a useful
beginning, and one may hope that they will reach the level of consensus
that would allow them to be codified into national legislation or
international agreements.

Dealing with these issues will require respect for expertise in the
fields to which we have often referred: science, technology, politics,
economics, business, law, and culture. [[We will need to incorporate
scientific advice into decision-making processes]{.underline}]{.mark},
and [[to]{.mark}]{.underline} acknowledge and [[manage the
risks]{.underline}]{.mark} and uncertainties in our understanding of the
science and the technology we are trying to manage, as well as in their
ramifications for the larger society. There is also a need to educate
governments and the public, both on the underlying science and
technology and on their links to the broader context. Finally, I would
urge that [[there is a need for an international obligation to identify
areas for scientific research]{.mark} and technological innovation that
can help [to resolve these issues and to support this research with
adequate]{.mark} financial, human and institutional
[resources.]{.mark}]{.underline} This last requirement should become a
general principle that should become part of the accepted framework for
thinking about global issues and incorporated into formal agreements on
these matters as a matter of usual practice.

Dealing with complex global, technology-intensive issues like these is a
tall order, especially when they require democratic countries to find
common interest with countries with whose governments they are otherwise
deeply at odds. Nevertheless, [[the world has faced such issues
successfully before under the]{.mark} arguably [**more difficult
conditions** of the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}, which pitted two
ideologically opposed superpowers against each other [[that nevertheless
managed to agree on elaborate and technically demanding measures to
avoid nuclear holocaust.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Working through the Science Agreement reduces [miscalculation]{.underline} and science diplomacy [empirically]{.underline} solves

entry point to renewed dialogue" Arctic Yearbook 2023

//DH

In the decades since the end of the Cold War, science has regularly been
depicted as an entry point to dialogue aimed at alleviating political
conflict or diplomatic tensions. [Science]{.underline} is after all not
politics; it [is a universal good, a common language, and a shared
value]{.underline}; moreover, it is grounded in widely-agreed fact
rather than opinion, which means that - at least in theory - [it is less
prone to ideological influence]{.underline}.

[Even [during the Cold War, science diplomacy helped to maintain threads
of communication]{.mark} across ideological divides, [and provided the
vehicle and substance for dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline} (see for example
Davis & Patman (eds), 2015). [[Thanks to science diplomacy, despite
geopolitical tensions the superpowers were able to]{.mark} find common
ground and [work together where they perceived a mutual interest or a
shared threat]{.mark}. Convergence around [the language of
science]{.mark} may have [helped them]{.mark} to [avert]{.mark} an even
greater rupture, and perhaps **more [dangerous
escalations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Regrettably today's geopolitical climate appears to be less amenable to
constructive exchange and joint, pragmatic problem-solving. [Russia's
brutal attack on Ukraine triggered an enormous counterreaction that has
led to the severing of West-Russia communications on multifarious
international issues]{.underline} and in various regions, [including the
High North.]{.underline}

As such, [[the Arctic is]{.mark} fast [becoming a new theatre for great
power politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. The recent sharpening of
geopolitical tensions introduces new unknown variables into the
international security landscape, and affects a broad gamut of issues on
which West-Russia coordination was once taken for granted, including
science. [[Without]{.mark} constructive [communication]{.mark} - which
has almost completely ceased - [there are risks that]{.mark}
misunderstandings, [**miscalculations**, or **simple neglect** may lead
to]{.mark} an environmental disaster or [a **dangerous new
conflagration**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In the absence of an adequate forum for addressing the urgent threats
facing the Arctic, in 2022 the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP)
launched a discreet dialogue process, the 'High North Talks', which has
met regularly since. The Talks offer an informal platform for
discussing - in a neutral setting - the threats and challenges,
potential solutions, and possible areas of renewed cooperation in the
Arctic. Attendees include experts from states with a stake in the
region - Arctic Council members (including Russia), as well as other
actors like China, the EU, Japan and India.

In the context of Russia's attack on Ukraine, the High North Talks
explore how Arctic affairs could be managed more effectively in spite of
the geopolitical turbulence. The Talks constitute one of the few
remaining venues where representatives from the countries most invested
in the Arctic can meet, in a safe and discreet environment, to discuss
the future of this region.

[One of [the most urgent]{.mark} topics [is]{.mark} the need [to
restore]{.mark} some meaningful [cooperation between the West and
Russia]{.mark}, at least [on]{.mark} the most pressing issues like
**[climate change monitoring]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While the rationale
for the West's response to Russian aggression in Ukraine is clear and
understood[, it is crucial that ways be found - perhaps through policies
that allow for targeted coordination in 'exceptional' cases - to manage
ongoing problems of global significance]{.underline}.

The case for resuming (the most urgent) scientific cooperation

There are at least three compelling arguments as to why scientific
cooperation in the Arctic should be resumed, with a view to averting an
environmental disaster. These arguments are based on law, principle, and
scientific fact.

A legal obligation

[[The]{.mark} 2017 [Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic
Scientific Cooperation]{.mark}, whose explicit purpose is to 'enhance
cooperation in Scientific Activities']{.underline} (Article 2), [[is
still in force. The]{.mark} signatories - who are the [eight Arctic
states]{.mark}]{.underline}1 - [[recognised]{.mark} in their Agreement
the importance of constructive cooperation and environmental protection
in the Arctic]{.underline} (preambular paragraphs 1 and 2); [reiterated
[the urgent need for]{.mark} increased [actions to mitigate and adapt to
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} (preambular paragraph 3);
[[and]{.mark} noted the importance of [international scientific
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} (preambular paragraph 5).

Moreover, [in order to achieve said enhanced cooperation, the [states
parties entered into]{.mark} a number of [commitments]{.mark}, including
[to facilitate the entry and exit of persons and equipment involved in
scientific activities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Article 4), [[as well as
access to research infrastructure]{.mark} and facilities]{.underline}
(Article 5), [research areas]{.underline} (Article 6) [[and
data]{.underline}]{.mark} (Article 7).

[**[These commitments are legally binding]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
Article 18 provides for the amendment of the Agreement, and 19(3) for
automatic renewal after its initial five-year validity unless a party
announces its withdrawal from it. Also, any party may withdraw via
written notification (Article 19(4)). However, since these provisions
have not been triggered, the Agreement remains valid and binding.

Acute regional and [global shocks since the signing of the Agreement
have significantly altered the geopolitical landscape,]{.underline} and
rendered various forms of collaboration untenable. [However, [the
urgency of the problems afflicting the Arctic has not diminished in line
with reduced cooperation, nor have the obligations contained in the 2017
Agreement been put on hold]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The parties must be
cognizant of the fact that [if its provisions are not followed]{.mark},
not only will [states be in breach of their international legal
obligations]{.mark}, but the rest of the world will face real life
repercussions]{.underline}.

FROM COOPERATION TO CONFLICT: A NEW ERA FOR THE ARCTIC?

Extraordinary cultural and [[ecological features are at stake in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} where some of the world's last great
stretches of intact, wild nature are found. [These [remaining areas of
still-unfragmented]{.mark}]{.underline} terrestrial and marine
[[ecosystems are **critical for the planet**]{.mark}**,** [as they
provide a **buffer against climate impacts**]{.mark}. They offer refuge
for declining species of flora and fauna, allow for the movement of
migratory wildlife, [and serve as **repositories for genetic
diversity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Throughout the Arctic, including in
the Bering Strait region, such areas also provide important food
resources and form the basis of cultural identity for five
linguistically distinct peoples: Yu'pik, Siberian Yu'pik, Inupiaq,
Evenki, and Chukchi. Today, 70 percent of the world's remaining
wilderness areas exist in just five countries---three of which are
Arctic Nations: the United States (given the vast stretches of wild
lands in Alaska), Canada, and Russia.1

Most Arctic wildlife species are highly mobile, migrating across
political boundaries. Therefore, understanding the condition of many of
these populations, particularly at a time of rapid climate change,
depends on collaboration with Russia considering that it is home to 90
percent of Arctic species,2 encompasses 46.7 percent of the world's
permafrost-covered regions,3 and occupies half of the Arctic Ocean's
coastline.4

ARCTIC ENVIRONMENTAL COOPERATION: FROM THE 1970s TO TODAY

For most of this century, the Arctic region has been a place of peace
and cooperation in science and environmental protection, built on a
foundation of multiple agreements signed in the twentieth century. Even
before the end of the Cold War, along with non-proliferation and space
exploration, the protection of the environment was among the few areas
of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The 1972
United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was the first global
conference to focus on environmental issues. It sparked a new era of
transboundary efforts to address the world's most pressing environmental
problems as reflected in its outcome The Stockholm Declaration. Shortly
thereafter, the United States and the USSR signed a bilateral agreement,
prioritizing collaboration in several environmental fields.5 This
agreement identified eleven subject areas for joint research and
information exchange, ranging from air and water pollution to the
conservation of wildlife and natural areas. Notably, the agreement
singled out Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems as a specific area for
collaboration6 and created momentum for similar transboundary efforts
between the two countries, like the U.S.-USSR Migratory Bird Convention
of 1978.7 Multilateral cooperation also arose in response to the near
depletion of the global polar bear population due to decades of trophy
hunting. By the early 1970s, concerned about the fate of the species,
representatives from polar bear range states---Denmark, Canada, Norway,
the United States, and the USSR---began negotiations on measures to
protect the iconic Arctic species. Ultimately, the five nations signed
the International Polar Bear Agreement of 1973.8

In 1987, in the waning years of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev
highlighted the need for collaboration in energy development and
encouraged nations to work together to establish the Arctic as a zone of
peace where that could be achieved. In his "Murmansk Speech," Gorbachev
urged nations to "hurry to protect the nature of the tundra . . . and
the northern forest areas."9 His call to action led to the signing of
the historic Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy in 1991. Under
this new multinational arrangement, experts from Arctic countries formed
working groups to collaborate in monitoring air and water pollution,
protecting the marine environment, conserving the Arctic flora and
fauna, and preventing, preparing against, and responding to
environmental emergencies.10 In 1996, these four working groups were
reconstituted into the structure of a new body, the Arctic Council, the
first intergovernmental forum uniting all Arctic states---Canada,
Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Iceland, Norway, and the United
States---in the shared mission of sustainable development and
environmental protection. The Council also set up a unique role for the
region's Indigenous peoples through the creation of the Permanent
Participant designation.11 Since its beginning, six primary Indigenous
peoples' organizations have been engaged and consulted on all aspects of
the Council's work.

As this new format of circumpolar collaboration grew, other
organizations embraced the opportunity to connect across newly-opened
borders in the wake of the USSR's dissolution. A wave of Western
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and scientific organizations
flooded Russia, meeting their local counterparts and exchanging
optimism, ideas, questions, curiosity, and technology.12,13,14 With
funding from Western charitable foundations and government sources,
dozens of green groups across northern Eurasia blossomed, re-energizing
the region's youth movement and existing conservation community with new
opportunities.15 American organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF), Pacific Environment, Wild Salmon Center, Wildlife Conservation
Society, Baikal Watch, and the Audubon Society developed extensive
programs with Russian counterparts in endangered species conservation
and protected areas establishment. Agencies such as the U.S. Forest
Service, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the U.S.
National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service invested
decades of expertise and funds in monitoring the trade in wildlife
products, studying shared populations of wild life, and training Russian
and U.S. protected areas staff in wildfire control. Other areas of
professional exchanges included environmental education, media training,
eco-tourism, sustainable management and monitoring of forests and
fisheries, and application of technical tools such as Geographic
Information Systems, wildlife population modeling, and remote sensing.
These entities also collaborated with Russian organizations to involve
civil society in nature conservation actions through public outreach,
school programs, citizen science, and building membership organizations.

The Arctic Council evolved during this period, both in thematic scope
and in size. The inclusion of non-Arctic states and NGOs as observers in
the Council nurtured the Arctic's spirit of peace and cooperation.
Within the field of biodiversity conservation, these entities work with
Arctic Council member states and Permanent Participants (Arctic
Indigenous peoples' organizations) to address emerging issues such as
biodiversity loss. For instance, the working group Conservation of
Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) launched the Arctic Migratory Bird
Initiative to identify major breeding areas and stopover sites for
particular bird species of major conservation concern, protect coastal
habitat, and integrate Indigenous knowledge into these efforts.16
Another Arctic Council working group, Protection of the Arctic Marine
Environment (PAME), published a seminal report on underwater noise in
the Arctic, a problem affecting marine life that has arisen from
declining sea ice and increasing marine vessel traffic.17 As the
convener of these initiatives, the Arctic Council has become the
preeminent intergovernmental forum for sharing information and pooling
financial and intellectual resources to advance environmental protection
and sustainable development---until February 2022, that is.18

FROM COOPERATION TO CONFLICT: CHALLENGES IN A FRACTURED ARCTIC

[Russia encompasses a significant portion of the Arctic Ocean coastline,
Arctic wildlife, intact ecosystems, and other natural assets. Russian
engagement in Arctic conservation and science is important]{.underline}
not only because of the presence of these elements and values but also
because of the [country's long history of conserving natural habitats in
an extensive system of protected areas]{.underline}. [In the Russian
Arctic, examples of the various categories include strict nature
reserves]{.underline} (zapovedniks)---[where, except for ecological
monitoring and research, all human activities]{.underline}, including
tourism, [are prohibited or severely restricted]{.underline} ---such as
Wrangel Island Nature Reserve (also known as the "polar bear nursery"
for its large concentration of maternity dens). This network of
conservation areas includes special-purpose preserves called zakazniks,
such as the recently established New Siberian Islands Wildlife Sanctuary
(encompassing habitat for the endangered Atlantic walrus), and national
parks. This latter category includes Beringia National Park, which
protects ecological and cultural features common to both Alaska and the
Chukotka province.

In response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,
the seven other Arctic nations paused their involvement in the Arctic
Council, signaling the first major diplomatic rupture in the Council's
twenty-six-year history.19 With only Russia remaining---and,
coincidentally, at the time serving as Chair of the Arctic
Council---even the most basic operations within the Council came to an
abrupt halt, bringing the Arctic's future into question.

Meanwhile, other international bodies forged ahead on the conservation
front, and in December of 2022, nearly 200 nations agreed on a new
Global Framework for Biodiversity, an ambitious agreement seeking, among
other goals, to protect 30 percent of the world's waters and land by
2030. As a signatory to the Convention on Biodiversity, Russia joined
this consensus-based decision and, in theory, should be contributing to
its implementation. Indeed, considering the scale of the Arctic, this
global charter to conserve unique and representative biodiversity would
not be possible without the world's largest country, Russia. However,
even outside the Arctic Council, most bilateral science and conservation
cooperative programs with Russia have halted, creating new challenges
for the realization of this important roadmap for biodiversity
protection.

Managing shared Arctic economic resources will be more challenging
without the ability of Western experts to communicate with their Russian
counterparts. For example, the Bering Sea pollock fishery---one of the
world's largest fish stocks---generates over USD 1 billion annually in
the United States and straddles the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary.20 As
ocean temperatures increase and the Bering Sea "cold pool"---a cold
water barrier that historically has segmented the distribution of
certain fish species---vanishes, biologists have recorded the presence
of pollock much further north and more westerly in years of high ocean
temperatures.21 This movement of the stock into Russia's portion of the
Bering Sea, and even north of the Bering Strait, means that sustainable
management of the population would be best served through bilateral
cooperation or, at the very least, information sharing about the status
of stocks. Similarly, Norway and Russia share a common stock of cod in
the Barents Sea, and since the 1950s, the two sides have collaborated on
fisheries and ecosystem management. Despite the war in Ukraine, Norway
has continued to partner with Russia on managing Barents Sea
fisheries.22

In May 2023, Norway assumed the Arctic Council chairmanship from Russia
through a successful transfer that required the commitment of all Arctic
States and months of delicate negotiations. Norway's leadership of the
organization for its two-year term now provides a window of opportunity
to reinvigorate cooperation on biological diversity at a time when
climate change is rapidly impacting the abundance and distribution of
wildlife, and industrialization and other human pressures are
transforming natural landscapes.

HIGH COSTS OF SEVERING U.S.RUSSIA COOPERATION IN THE BERING STRAIT

Besides the immense human tragedy wrought by Russia's [[war
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Ukraine]{.mark}, the]{.underline} war has
[[ruptured **transboundary conservation**]{.mark} efforts,
[]{.mark}which will have long-term consequences on wildlife and
ecosystems in the Arcti]{.underline}c. As discussed above, [[for
decades, Russian]{.mark}, European, [and American
scientists]{.mark}---often [through cooperation with Indigenous
communities]{.mark}---[worked together to conserve biodiversity and
protect changing Arctic habitats]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result of
the war in Ukraine, [[biologists in Russia and Western countries have
had to pause]{.mark} their joint work [indefinitely and cease all
communication]{.mark}, leaving a significant information
vacuum]{.underline}.

[One of the adverse outcomes resulting from the breakdown in cooperation
is the disruption in joint efforts to manage ship traffic in the Bering
Strait]{.underline}. In the early 2000s, a coalition of NGOs in the
United States and Russia, as well as Alaska Native Organizations (ANOs),
became concerned about the environmental risks posed by growing ship
traffic in Arctic waters. In the Bering Strait, increasing vessel
transits signified a greater potential for collisions with whales and
small watercraft, groundings, oil spills, and increased underwater
noise, which disturb marine mammals' ability to communicate. In
response, these groups advocated for the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) to designate a specific route for ships to follow.
They also proposed the designation of Areas To Be Avoided (ATBAs), zones
that exclude maritime vessels from ecologically-sensitive or
navigationally-risky sites. In America, the ANOs and NGOs worked with
the U.S. Coast Guard, while in Russia, conservation groups worked with
their country's federal Marine Rescue Service. Throughout the process,
Russian and American environmental groups were in regular communication.
Then in 2017, the United States and Russia submitted a joint proposal to
the IMO for those routing measures.23 The IMO approved the establishment
of the new shipping route and some ATBAs in U.S. waters in 2018, an
achievement that would not have been possible without bilateral
coordination. However, some proposals were not adopted, leaving the
protection of other Bering Strait sites to be decided by future joint
efforts.

One area that was considered---but ultimately not included---in the 2017
joint proposal was the Diomede Islands, a pair of islands in the middle
of the strait divided by the international maritime boundary. On the
American side is the Alaska Native community of Little Diomede, while on
the Russian side is Big Diomede, whose Indigenous population was removed
from the island during World War II, when the Soviet military
established a base there.

The islands explode with wildlife every summer, hosting vibrant seabird
colonies, large walrus haul-outs on the south side of Big Diomede, and
rich marine life, from fish to snow crabs.24 American conservation
groups continue to push the U.S. Coast Guard to work with Russia to
submit a joint proposal for an ATBA to protect the islands. But Russia's
war in Ukraine eliminated any chance for progress. Now that bilateral
communication on the conservation and management of this exceptionally
special area has stopped, the Diomede Islands remain all the more
vulnerable to the negative impacts of ship traffic.

In another example, in September 2021, [the U.S. Coast Guard and
Russia's Marine Rescue Service agreed on plans to conduct in-water oil
spill response exercises in the Bering Strait the following
spring]{.underline}. Each party planned to bring response vessels and
equipment to the region to practice how to work together in the event of
an oil spill. Unsurprisingly, [these plans are now shelved, leaving
questions about what sort of response would be launched in the event of
a spill]{.underline}.

ALL HOPE IS NOT LOST

Many experts seem resigned to a protracted conflict between Russia and
the West. The desire to significantly restrict contact with Russia---as
expressed in policy by most Western nations in the immediate aftermath
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine---is understandable. However,
[[for]{.mark} the longterm well-being of [**humanity and planetary
health**, the preservation of Arctic ecosystems is
critical]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Given the tremendous scale of Russia's
geography, and the **urgency of stabilizing global climate**]{.mark}
systems, [collaboration]{.mark} with Russia [is essential to
resolving]{.mark} both [global]{.mark} and Arctic [environmental
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As the war in Ukraine grinds on, [the
planet continues to warm and biodiversity continues to
vanish]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the interim, [[to have any hope of
mitigating the worst impacts]{.mark} of these problems,]{.underline} we
believe that some [[cooperation between Russia and the West is warranted
in Arctic research]{.mark} and conservation]{.underline}.

## Climate scenario

### Inherency -- no permafrost cooperation

#### Invasion of Ukraine ends US-Russian Arctic science exploration of permafrost

Chelsea **Harvey,** 20**24** -- member of E&E\'s extreme weather rapid
response team, where she reports on the links between climate change and
worsening disasters around the world."Russia's war on Ukraine chills
Arctic climate science" E&E News by Politico, 2/23
<https://www.eenews.net/articles/russias-war-on-ukraine-chills-arctic-climate-science/>
//DH

For much of his career, Alaska-based scientist Vladimir Romanovsky has
collaborated with colleagues back home in his native Russia on one of
the most important --- and enigmatic --- aspects of Earth's climate
system.

They've been monitoring gradual shifts in [[Arctic
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}, a type of carbon-rich frozen soil
common in the chilliest parts of the world.

But in the last two years, these [[collaborations have grown
cold]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022 --- sending shock waves around
the world and disrupting international research. Sanctions and
communication barriers between Russia and many other nations, including
the United States, have made it increasingly difficult for scientists to
work together.

Romanovsky's project is one of many still suffering the consequences.

For the last two decades, Romanovsky and other scientists at the
University of Alaska, Fairbanks --- where he's now a professor emeritus
--- have kept tabs on permafrost temperatures in North America and
Eurasia with help from Russian scientists.

[[Researchers on either side of the Bering Strait have shared data, sent
equipment back and forth and]{.mark} sometimes [traveled between the
U.S. and Russia to visit field sites and set up monitoring]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}.

It's crucial research. As permafrost warms and thaws, it releases large
volumes of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, potentially
worsening the progression of climate change and further accelerating
Arctic warming.

[The project didn't halt immediately after Russia invaded
Ukraine]{.underline}, Romanovsky said. Up until about a year ago,
scientists in both countries still could communicate with one another,
and the researchers in Alaska still were able to send funding to their
Russian colleagues for fieldwork and data collection.

[But near]{.underline} the beginning of [2023, the researchers in Russia
began asking them to stop. It was too dangerous]{.underline}, Romanovsky
said. The [scientists were worried that accepting funding from U.S.
institutes, even for research, could get them scrutinized as foreign
agents.]{.underline}

Scientists stopped sending data from Russian field sites around the same
time, for similar reasons.

A few years of data interruption won't necessarily spell doom for the
project, Romanovsky said. Permafrost research is slow by definition ---
it thaws gradually, often over the course of decades, and it can take
many years to tease out trends.

But [a long-term hole could cause problems for scientists. [Russia
contains]{.mark} some of [the largest permafrost swaths in the
world]{.mark}, with nearly two-thirds of the country's land mass sitting
atop the frozen soil. [That's a lot of data to permanently
lose]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Hopefully the gap will be not that long, and everybody hopes it will be
ending soon," Romanovsky said. "But nobody knows."

Russian collaborations crumble

It's not just permafrost research that's suffering. The war has taken a
toll on other scientific collaborations with Russian researchers ---
particularly Arctic studies, which are critical to global climate
research. Russia has the longest Arctic coastline of any country in the
world at 15,000 miles.

[In]{.underline} June [2022, [the White House indicated]{.mark} that [it
would]{.mark} begin to "[wind down" scientific]{.mark} and technological
[cooperation with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Government [agencies
should conclude collaborations that were funded prior to the invasion of
Ukraine]{.mark},]{.underline} the guidance suggested, [[and]{.mark} then
should [curtail their interactions with research institutions affiliated
with the Russian government]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The National Science Foundation]{.underline}, which funds thousands of
research projects annually, has [followed these guidelines over the past
two years. [Prior to the invasion, NSF-funded projects involving Russian
collaborations included studies on]{.mark} the changing Arctic Ocean,
Arctic wildfires, [permafrost,]{.mark} melting sea ice, marine
transportation, infrastructure development and climate
resilience]{.underline} [in Arctic communities]{.underline}.

"As instructed in the guidance, [awards made prior to the invasion were
directed to wind down]{.underline}," an NSF spokesperson noted in an
email to E&E News. "Several projects were rescoped to continue research
where feasible. [[Since the invasion, no new awards have been issued
involving Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}."

While the White House guidance allowed nongovernmental institutions to
make their own decisions about collaborative science, some U.S.
universities have proceeded to sever ties with Russian partners.

Shortly after the war began, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
decided to terminate its decadelong relationship with Skolkovo Institute
of Science and Technology in Moscow. Meanwhile, multiple institutions
around the U.S. announced their intent to pull all their investments in
Russian assets, Inside Higher Ed reported.

**[[Other countries]{.mark} have [followed suit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, reported last year that at
least 15 joint research projects between Japan and Russia had terminated
since the start of the war. Curtailed collaborations have ranged from
studies on the spread of avian flu to forest management projects.

The European Union also has implemented rigorous restrictions on
cooperation with Russian institutes. That means some EU-funded research
initiatives no longer include Russian data --- a large hole in climate
and environmental monitoring systems.

The INTERACT Arctic monitoring network is a prime example, scientists
have warned.

An EU initiative, INTERACT --- short for International Network for
Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic --- is one of the
largest pan-Arctic monitoring networks in the world, with dozens of
stations across multiple countries collecting information on a variety
of environmental variables.

Twenty-one INTERACT stations in Russia are currently on pause --- nearly
a fifth of the network's total number of research bases.

In a recent paper published in the scientific journal Nature Climate
Change, researchers investigated the effects of the pause on INTERACT's
data products. They found that the network is already a bit biased to
begin with --- stations across the Arctic are more likely to be located
in wetter and warmer areas with deeper snowpack, less vegetation and
less soil carbon.

But [[excluding the Russian stations skews the
datasets]{.underline}]{.mark} even further, the analysis found. About
half of the INTERACT stations reflecting data from boreal ecosystems ---
including all of Siberia's forested taiga --- are found in Russia. That
eliminates a large set of measurements from these unique climate zones.

"[[An increase in bias means a decrease in our ability to accurately
describe Arctic changes]{.underline}]{.mark}," said lead study author
Efrén López-Blanco, a researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark.

[[If the data gaps persist]{.mark} for the long term, [they]{.mark}
could [make it]{.mark} more [difficult]{.mark} for scientists [to build
accurate climate models]{.mark}]{.underline}, which help them project
future changes in the Arctic climate.

'Being half blind'

Meanwhile, cooperation between Russia and other members of the Arctic
Council ground to a halt shortly after the war began in 2022.

The Arctic Council facilitates collaboration on a variety of
environmental issues, including conservation, pollution, climate change,
fisheries and resource management. It's also helped negotiate and
oversee a number of cooperative climate and environmental research
projects, such as the Arctic Wildland Fire Ecology Mapping and
Monitoring Project, which tracks the area burned by wildfires each year
to evaluate their impact on Arctic ecosystems and communities.

Last month, Russia threatened to fully abandon the Arctic Council and
since has suspended its annual payments to the council's budget.

[Lengthening Russian data gaps comes at a time when Arctic monitoring is
more important than ever, said]{.underline} Margaret [Williams, a senior
fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Arctic Initiative]{.underline}.

"[People]{.underline} in the Lower 48 probably still [don't understand
the importance of the Arctic --- how it impacts planetary systems,
climate patterns, birds from every continent migrate to the
Arctic,]{.underline}" she said. "We're all connected. Everyone is
connected to the Arctic in some way."

[Research has suggested that rapid Arctic climate change]{.underline}
--- [which is progressing]{.underline} as much as [four times faster
than the global average rate --- may influence climate and weather
patterns around the globe.]{.underline}

Prior to joining the Harvard Kennedy School, Williams spent much of her
career working with the World Wide Fund for Nature on Arctic wildlife
monitoring projects. These included collaborative international efforts
to keep tabs on walrus, polar bears and other animals with populations
shared between the U.S. and Russia.

[Since the war began, communications with Russian government agencies,
scientific institutes and nongovernmental organizations has largely
ceased]{.underline}, she said.

"So it's kind of like being half blind trying to understand what's going
on in the area by not having the full picture, not being able to
communicate," she said.

The communication breakdowns are taking a toll on Russian researchers as
well, said Romanovsky, who still tries to keep in touch with former
colleagues when he can.

Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, many Russian scientists openly
expressed their opposition to the war. Now, two years later, they're
increasingly academically isolated.

"Some of the people I know, they really are depressed about this
situation," Romanovsky said.

The Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation

In an effort to promote international Arctic science and ease some of
the challenges experienced by the international Arctic scientific
community regarding transnational access, [[the Arctic
Eight]{.underline}]{.mark} (Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway,
Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Russia) [[signed the Agreement on Enhancing
International Arctic Scientific Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} (in
this paper called: 'the Agreement') in May 2018. All countries have
different regulations for providing permits to conduct scientific
research, for importing and exporting samples, and for granting visas to
scientific staff. This paper shows that many individual scientists and
larger national scientific organisations experience challenges in
understanding which permit, visa, and other necessities are obligatory
for cross-border travelling to conduct scientific research.

[[The Agreement states]{.mark} that [the Arctic Eight aim to increase
access to their countries' Arctic research facilities for international
scientists]{.mark} and research staff [and to ease challenges]{.mark}
experienced [when importing and exporting scientific equipment
transnationally]{.mark}]{.underline}, within the bounds of national
laws. Arctic Council member states are encouraged to provide such
assistance to scientists from further afield as well.

International developments disrupting the implementation of the
Agreement

[[Since the]{.mark} signing and [entering into force of the Agreement,
there have been]{.mark}]{.underline} two [[major]{.underline}]{.mark}
international [[disruptions for the Arctic research
community]{.underline}]{.mark} that have affected their access to the
Arctic significantly. The first disruption was the global COVID-19
pandemic which limited access to research stations severely as most
transnational travelling was highly restricted or banned. The second
major disruption was when [many [Arctic actors]{.mark} enabling and
[conducting scientific research **froze cooperation** with Arctic
science institutes affiliated with Russian stakeholders due to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}. [This]{.mark} effectively [made the
Russian Arctic inaccessible to the Western polar research
community]{.mark} and made the]{.underline} European and [American
Arctic inaccessible to scientists employed by Russian
institutes]{.underline}.

[[Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} full-scale [[invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in February 2022 [has triggered a series of
geopolitical events that [have cascading effects on the Arctic]{.mark}
region]{.underline}. From military posturing to the frozen regional
institutional cooperation, [[the polar region is facing its **most
critical moment**]{.mark}]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War.
While the last three decades have witnessed a proliferation of
cooperation among Arctic states and other non-state stakeholders,
scientific cooperation has emerged has a pivotal nexus for sustaining
dialogue and collaboration despite the intensifying geopolitical rivalry
between Western countries and Russia (Byers, 2019). In particular, the
Arctic Council, established in 1996, has been successful in insulating
regional governance and the expanded cooperation network from
geopolitical disputes, despite the rapidly declining trust between the
Western Arctic states and the Russian government.

However, [the outbreak of the [war stopped all]{.mark} forms of
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} between the West and Russia. In the
midst of the heightened geopolitical tensions, [international
[scientific projects in the polar region were suspended]{.mark} and
academic visits to Russia became significantly challenging for Western
scientists,]{.underline} jeopardizing long three decades of fruitful
cooperation (Dobrovidova, 2024; Exner-Pirot, 2024; Harvey, 2024;
McKenzie, 2022). This occurs with the region experiencing an accelerated
climate change, with Arctic temperatures rising four times faster than
the global average temperature since 1979 (Rantanen et al., 2022). This
rapid path is causing long-lasting implications in the region and beyond
as the planet moves into a new climate regime with complex and uncertain
outcomes. Given these dynamics, the post-World War II and then post-Cold
War collective security system, which is built around the United Nations
(UN) Charter ultimately appears to have critical gaps in addressing such
complex and systemic challenges (Wilson, 2020).

Although efforts are being made to maintain scientific ties between the
Western research community and its Russian counterpart,
[[cooperation]{.mark} in this area has **[suffered a critical
blow]{.mark}** [from which it seems difficult to
recover]{.mark}]{.underline}. From restoring the activities of working
groups within the Arctic Council to conducting research field activities
in the Russian Arctic territory, **[[reviving the close scientific
cooperation]{.mark} built up over the decades [is critical in the face
of the rapid climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The polar research
community is facing major setbacks as [scientific data collection is the
basis for objective, systematic surveys]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bowler,
2024; López-Blanco et al., 2024). Meanwhile, [Russia is committed to
further developing its scientific cooperation with non-Western
countries,]{.underline} especially Asian countries such as China and
India. In this moving context, [climate science is at the crux of the
systemic geopolitical rivalry between the United States and
China]{.underline}.

### AT: Satellites / AI solve models

#### Satellites and AI can't replace ground-based data -- it just means models constructed will be biased

While the international permafrost research community already faced
these structural challenges[, the war drastically cut the permafrost
scientific cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline} region. This
[geopolitical upheaval]{.underline} has not only [stalled international
research collaborative projects]{.underline}, but it is also defining
new conditions in which the post-Cold War model of cooperation in the
Arctic is no longer relevant. In fact, various layers of cooperation,
whether directly or indirectly related to the permafrost monitoring,
have been affected by Western political decisions to boycott Russia in
all fields of polar science, including permafrost, as illustrated in
Table 1.

The deterioration of relations between Western countries and Russia has
had a significant impact on the geopolitical landscape of the Arctic,
with implications for permafrost monitoring. [The [lack of access to
data from Russian monitoring stations has created a barrier for Western
scientists]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, the altering permafrost data
flow is reconfiguring itself, which can be seen through three key
lenses: (a) the Western blind spot; (b) Russia's isolationism; and (c)
the rise of Asian powerhouses.

\(a\)

[For the West, [the breakdown in cooperation creates a new reality
for]{.mark} pursuing and [conducting research to monitor]{.mark} the
state of [permafrost]{.mark} in the Arctic region]{.underline}
(López-Blanco et al., 2024; Schuur et al., 2024). [[The end of
missions]{.mark} by Western scientific teams [on Russian territory
interrupts]{.mark} not only cooperation with Russian researchers, but
also [access to the data essential for building **accurate** and
**credible** models.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The use of alternative
means, such as remote sensing and a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, to substitute for the loss of data from Russian
monitoring stations [cannot compensate]{.mark} for all these
losses]{.underline} (Bartsch et al., 2023; Gay et al., 2023). For
western permafrost research, [[Russian territory]{.underline}]{.mark} is
becoming a blind spot that [[poses serious]{.mark} and long-term
[challenges with respect to study reliability and
bias]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

At present, [there are no satellites with dedicated permafrost
monitoring missions, nor are there satellites that dwell over the
Arctic]{.underline} (i.e., in highly elliptical orbit). While notable
[CH4 monitoring initiatives with an Arctic component provide only
limited CH4 monitoring]{.underline} data, the data are nonetheless
sufficient to support early-stage collaborative frameworks, as well as
providing insight into current limitations of Arctic CH4 monitoring
capabilities and system-level data integration.36 The initiatives
highlighted below demonstrate the importance of international
collaboration in global methane monitoring. Two complementary
initiatives discussed below, Carbon Mapper and MethaneSAT, highlight the
critical role of public-private partnerships for monitoring at scale.

John Holdren: And I have to say, I agree with all of that. And I think
what is going to be important in terms of U.S. participation is that the
philanthropic community has to continue to step up. [The philanthropic
community]{.underline} [has already been a major funder of activities
related to the Arctic,]{.underline} and in light of what the Trump
administration has been doing, we're going to need even more help from
that community, and I think we'll get it[. But]{.underline} the
liability is that [the foundations]{.underline} [don't actually have
enough money to replace all of the important things that the federal
government is abandoning. So while they will help for sure, we're still
going to continue to need to work on reversing some of the more damaging
things that the Trump administration has been doing]{.underline}.

### Permafrost thaw causes warming

#### Permafrost thaw risks accelerating global climate change, destroys ecosystems and food security -- collaborative research is essential to adaptation and policy change

Susanna **Gartler** et al, 20**25** -- Professor in Department of Social
and Cultural Anthropology at University of Vienna, Austrian Polar
Research Institute "A transdisciplinary, comparative analysis reveals
key risks from Arctic permafrost thaw" Nature, 1/16
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01883-w> //DH

The [Arctic permafrost]{.underline}, home to more than three million
people1, [forms the foundation of human life and is a crucial component
of coupled socioecological systems2. Arctic permafrost is]{.underline},
however, warming and [thawing]{.underline}3,4,5, [and]{.underline}
projections indicate that [most]{.underline} of it [will]{.underline}
degrade and [disappear by 2050]{.underline} 1. Driven by climatic and
environmental changes, as well as human disturbances, [permafrost thaw
poses considerable risks with far-reaching implications for the global
climate system and]{.underline} local [Arctic communities]{.underline}.
These risks, in conjunction with rapid socioenvironmental
transformations6,7,8,9 and competing geopolitical interests10,
necessitate urgent understanding and action. At the global scale, [the
release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost creates a feedback
loop that exacerbates climate warming]{.underline} and perpetuates
permafrost degradation11,12,13,14. Regionally and locally, [permafrost
thaw leads to physical, chemical, and biological shifts and landscape
and ecosystem alterations]{.underline} 6,7,15, which often result in
hazards. [These hazards]{.underline}, defined as harmful phenomena with
adverse impacts, [significantly affect]{.underline} Arctic communities'
livelihoods16,17,18,19 and nearly all aspects of human life,
[including]{.underline} the economy20,
[infrastructure]{.underline}21,22,23, culture and heritage24,25,26,27,
[fisheries]{.underline} 28,29, [food and water security]{.underline}
17,30,31 [and health]{.underline} 32,33,34,35,36. Such complex
interrelations and sequences of events constitute risks that are
perceived differently among (i) individuals (e.g., scientists, local
stakeholders) on the basis of their worldviews, needs, and concerns37,
as well as (ii) Arctic communities due to their differences in
historical, cultural, environmental, and socioeconomic settings19,38.
[Risk perceptions]{.underline} ultimately [influence decision-making and
the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation strategies needed
for]{.underline} local [risk management]{.underline}. In this context,
[comprehensive assessments that consider the multifaceted aspects of
permafrost thaw risk]{.underline} and diverse perceptions [are essential
**tools for informing policymaking**]{.underline}.

Risk assessment is the process of systematically identifying, analyzing,
and evaluating (qualitatively or quantitatively) risks. In the
scientific literature, risk definitions and assessment methods differ
greatly, focusing either on the physical or social dimensions of risk
and rarely considering its subjective nature through perceptions39. In
addition, the growing body of knowledge on climate-related hazards and
risk assessments in the Arctic thus far consists mostly of sectoral
studies40,41,42,43,44,45, which lack a comparative approach. The [risks
and impacts of permafrost thaw on coupled socioecological
systems]{.underline}46 [remain understudied]{.underline} from an inter-
and transdisciplinary perspective47,48,49. [The fact that risks are not
perceived or understood uniformly, neither by local stakeholders nor
across scientific disciplines, underscores the importance of developing
a comprehensive]{.underline} and transdisciplinary [understanding of
both the environmental and societal implications of permafrost thaw.
This]{.underline} [understanding is crucial for addressing the
challenges posed by permafrost degradation while considering both the
unique and shared challenges faced by Arctic communities in the context
of climate change]{.underline}.

#### Permafrost thaw will rapidly accelerate warming and disrupt existing climate models

that address the impacts of permafrost thaw and climate change. "Thawing
Grounds, Rising Stakes: The Importance of Including Permafrost Emissions
in Climate Policy" The Arctic Institute, 4/1,

//DH

As the world races to limit global warming to 1.5°C, [a critical
and]{.underline} often [overlooked climate threat looms: the rapid thaw
of permafrost in Arctic regions.
Permafrost]{.underline}1)---continuously frozen ground that covers vast
portions of the Arctic---[is]{.underline} thawing, [releasing large
amounts of greenhouse gases]{.underline} (GHGs) [previously locked in
frozen soils, amplifying warming at a scale that could derail global
climate goals]{.underline}. Current international climate plans put the
world on track for a warming of around 2.7°C, far exceeding the Paris
Agreement's target.2) Yet emissions from thawing permafrost remain
largely absent from Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)---the
cornerstone of international climate commitments under the Paris
Agreement. This article explores why permafrost emissions are excluded
from NDCs and the consequences of this omission, and proposes concrete
steps to ensure that permafrost emissions are fully integrated into
future climate strategies. [This substantial gap in climate policy
threatens Arctic ecosystems and the global effort to stabilize the
climate.]{.underline}

The hidden climate risks of permafrost emissions

A major blind spot in global climate mitigation strategies is the
exclusion of permafrost carbon emissions from the current global carbon
budget frameworks. As nations strive to limit global temperature rise
and meet their NDCs under the Paris Agreement, they are failing to
account for the emissions released from thawing permafrost, a serious
risk to achieving these goals. Without including permafrost emissions in
global climate targets, current climate commitments do not fully
represent our future emissions. This creates a gap between policy and
reality, which could underestimate the actual scale of emissions and
accelerate warming.

[Permafrost holds]{.underline} approximately 1[.4 trillion metric tons
of carbon,]{.underline} nearly [twice the amount currently in the
atmosphere]{.underline}.3) It has been a stable carbon sink for
millennia, but this frozen ground has begun to thaw as the Arctic
experiences more rapid warming. [When permafrost thaws, it releases
carbon dioxide and methane]{.underline}, potent GHGs, into the
atmosphere. Once initiated, [this process accelerates global warming,
creating a feedback loop where permafrost thaw leads to further
emissions, exacerbating the warming that triggered it.]{.underline}

While gradual thaw processes are somewhat predictable, [abrupt thaw
events]{.underline}, known as thermokarsts, often triggered by
landslides, wildfires, or other environmental changes, [can suddenly
release massive amounts of carbon, leading to substantial and
unpredictable emissions]{.underline}. Many [current climate models fail
to account for these abrupt thaws,]{.underline} resulting in
underestimated future emissions.4) Recent studies suggest that about 77%
of near-surface permafrost could be lost by 2100, potentially releasing
massive quantities of carbon and other harmful pollutants that could
accelerate global warming.5) Addressing this uncertainty necessitates
the development of a more comprehensive carbon monitoring system in the
Arctic to accurately capture both gradual and abrupt thaw emissions,
ensuring that climate policies reflect the full scale of potential
risks.

The gravity of addressing permafrost thaw goes beyond the global carbon
budget. Thawing permafrost has devastating local consequences,
especially for Arctic communities. As frozen ground destabilizes, it
damages critical infrastructure, including homes, roads, and pipelines,
resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses. Indigenous
communities, whose lives and cultures are intimately connected to these
landscapes, face disruptions to animal migration patterns, biodiversity,
and their subsistence lifeways and traditional knowledge systems.6)
Additionally, [thawing frozen ground can release long-dormant pollutants
and pathogens]{.underline}, compounding environmental and health
challenges in affected regions. [As these localized impacts escalate,
they contribute to the global carbon cycle, creating feedback loops that
worsen the climate crisis]{.underline}. The permafrost crisis is not an
abstract environmental issue; it is a rapidly escalating threat that
impacts both the global climate and the well-being of Arctic peoples and
economies.

#### Arctic warming is accelerated four times greater than the global average

//DH

Less than one year later, [we have discovered that the negative
consequences of inaction are much higher than previously understood. The
latest data confirm that the Arctic has warmed three to four times
greater than the global average temperature increase of 1.1°C above
pre-industrial levels]{.underline} (Rantanen et al., 2022). In the
coming years, [Arctic temperatures are projected to continue rising. And
with these rising temperatures, we can expect to exacerbate a host of
climate hazards, including wildfires across Arctic tundra and boreal
forests, sea ice melt, coastal erosion, altered abundance and
distributions of key Arctic species, and permafrost thaw]{.underline}
(Armstrong McKay, et al., 2022).

### Russia key - climate

#### Arctic science fails without active Russian participation -- the size of the Russian Arctic is too large

Valery **Konyshev**, 20**23** -- Professor of Political Science at
Saint-Petersburg State University, Russia "Arctic Science Diplomacy:
With or Without Russia?" Geneva Centre for Security Policy Strategic
Security Analysis, September, Issue 32,
<https://www.gcsp.ch/sites/default/files/2024-12/ssa-2023-issue32-arctic-science-diplomacy-with-or-without-russia.pdf>
//DH

The prospects [for [Arctic science diplomacy are linked to]{.mark}
projects of global significance[: climate change]{.mark}, melting ice,
[thawing permafrost, ocean acidification]{.mark}, environmental
degradation [and the loss of biodiversity]{.mark}. All these processes
are transboundary]{.underline} in nature. [[To continue studying them
without Russia is **objectively impossible**]{.mark}, [because]{.mark}
in order [to build]{.mark} mathematical [models that accurately describe
global processes, it is necessary to regularly receive]{.mark} and
accumulate [data from sensors distributed throughout the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} The fact that [[Russia occupies]{.mark}
almost [half]{.mark} of [the Arctic]{.mark} space]{.underline} is an
obvious reason why scientists advocate a return to scientific
cooperation with that country.

[The first approach to possible scientific cooperation with Russia is
through scientific infrastructure projects, for example [the Snowflake
international Arctic station on the Yamal
Peninsula]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} which is manned all year round.
The station will use renewable energy sources and hydrogen fuel, so its
power unit will be environmentally clean. The AC working group on
sustainable development approved the project.

[Scientists can use the Snowflake station to [study]{.mark} climate
change and [the evolution of permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}, and to
develop technologies for Arctic medicine, carbon-free energy,
transportation, robotic complexes, and biotechnology. [While
[cooperation on Snowflake]{.mark}]{.underline} in the AC working groups
[[has been suspended]{.mark}, governments and companies from China,
India, Norway, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates are showing
interest]{.underline} in the project.36

[Floating platforms for scientific and educational activities are of
interest to potential Russian partners. The vessels Mikhail Somov,
Akademik Molchanov, Akademik Boris Petrov, and Kapitan Gorovatsky are
floating universities,]{.underline} while the vessels Akademik
Treshnikov, Akademik Fyodorov, and Dal\'nee Zelentsy are used for marine
research and expeditions. [The ice-resistant platform "North Pole",
which has 15 laboratories on board, allows year-round Arctic
expeditions]{.underline}.

As a result of cooperation between the Institute of Oil and Gas Geology
and Geophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Germany's
Helmholtz Institute Centre for Polar and Marine Research, [a year-round
Russian-German scientific station known as Samoilovsky Island was
created to monitor the dynamics of climate change and
permafrost]{.underline}, study the interactions between the Arctic
ecosystem and the atmosphere, and forecast methane emissions. However,
[international cooperation at the station was stopped in
2022]{.underline}.

Additionally, [[the largest Arctic stations have been in operation since
Soviet times]{.mark}: Cape Baranov Ice Base]{.underline} (on the
Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago), [the atmospheric observatory for climate
monitoring in Tiksi]{.underline} (Yakutia), [the Northeast Science
Station in Chersky]{.underline} (Yakutia), [and the Polar Geophysical
Institute observatory for monitoring geomagnetic variations and cosmic
rays]{.underline} (Spitsbergen).

[The second approach is through fundamental research. The study of ocean
acidification requires long-term cooperation]{.underline}. This is a
problem that occurs when the alkaline level of water declines,
threatening the extinction of many species of marine life. [To monitor
this phenomenon the Arctic Ocean Acidification Centre was established in
2020 as part of the Global Ocean Acidification Effect Observation and
Research Network]{.underline}. According to experts, to properly
understand ocean acidification it is necessary to collect huge amounts
of data on oceanic temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, pressure and
other parameters. It is crucial that researchers from different
countries have free access to this data.

[[The Arctic Baseline Observations Network project, initiated by the US
National Academy of Sciences]{.underline}]{.mark}, addresses this
challenge. The goal of the network is to create a system for sharing
data on changes in the Arctic\'s natural, socio-economic and cultural
conditions.37 Such projects, with the participation of the International
Arctic Science Committee and the AC working groups, simply [[**cannot
exist** without Russia\'s participation due to the size of its Arctic
territories]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Many states located far from the Arctic are interested in climate change
studies. For example, melting Arctic ice has destabilised the winds over
the Indian Ocean, resulting in chaotic monsoons. This anomaly is
accompanied by more prolonged droughts and floods, negatively affecting
agriculture throughout South Asia.38 China is experiencing more coastal
flooding and inland freezing.39 In Japan, warming waters are depleting
cold-water fish species in coastal seas, which are the mainstay of
fisheries in the north- east of the country.40 [Climate change is
creating not only widely discussed problems such as melting permafrost,
but also unexpected threats that can quickly become global]{.underline}.
For example, [Chinese scientists have discovered more than 1,000 new,
previously unknown species of bacteria in]{.underline} the [melting
ice]{.underline} of Tibet. If the melting continues, these bacteria
could end up in the rivers of India and China. It is highly likely that
today\'s plants, animals and humans are not immune to these ancient
bacteria.41

Environmental cooperation should also be mentioned. It is in the
interests of Russia\'s Arctic neighbours to develop transboundary
pollution control, which functioned through the AC working groups until
2022. This work can be continued on a bilateral basis with the Russian
Research Centre on the Spitsbergen Archipelago, Roshydromet, the AARI,
and university centres (SAFU, Moscow State University, Saint-Petersburg
State University, etc.).

#### Scientists won't [trust]{.underline} non-Russian data -- field sites are key

<https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/16/can-the-west-and-russia-co-operate-to-save-a-melting-arctic/>
//DH

The ongoing suspension of the Arctic Council means [[Western scientists
no longer have access to **field sites** in Russia]{.mark}, [to assess
permafrost data]{.mark} and other climate change-related
problems]{.underline}. They now rely on what they can see from space,
satellite images, and scientific models.

Troy Bouffard, Director at the Center for Arctic Security and Resilience
(CASR) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said [[scientific models
attempting to predict]{.mark} phenomena related to climate change,
including [permafrost, are **hard to trust** in the absence of Russian
data]{.mark}. "When the global scientific community does not share data,
we don't produce reliable scientific models,"]{.underline} said
Bouffard.

["\[[With\] ground-based observations now \[coming\] mainly from the
non-Russian parts of the Arctic, the ability to monitor the]{.mark}
status and [trajectory of the Arctic biome may be severely
limited]{.mark}]{.underline} over the foreseeable future," wrote authors
of a paper co-published this past January in the scientific journal,
Nature.

"**[[Half the Arctic is now a black box of empty
data]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Jennifer Spence, Project Director of
the Arctic Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs: "Sweden and Finland becoming members
of NATO has created new dynamics within the Arctic Council," Spence
added "which now consists of seven NATO nations and Russia."

Anne Morgenstern said most Western permafrost scientists understand that
this current situation, which prohibits them from travelling to Russia,
will last for many years. "At least as long as the war in Ukraine
continues and as long as there is no regime change in Russia," she said,
also pointing out that [Western scientists who previously worked in the
Russian Arctic cannot simply pick up where they left off i]{.underline}n
February 2022: "[The situation has changed so dramatically that
everything will have to be developed from scratch]{.underline}."

Stopped Science: What has been Lost in Siberia

Roughly 60 percent of Russia's terrestrial territory is made of
permafrost, and nearly [[half of the Arctic's permafrost is in
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Siberia has historically been a prime
location for permafrost research and international
cooperation]{.underline} due to the age and high concentration of its
permafrost. Unlike other regions' permafrost, Siberia's permafrost is
continuous and up to 5,410 feet deep. Additionally, [[Siberia contains
the highest amount of yedoma, a type of methane- and carbon-rich
permafro]{.underline}st]{.mark} that formed 10,000 to 1.8 million years
ago during the Pleistocene. Yedoma is [**[more sensitive]{.mark}** [to
increased warming compared to other kinds]{.mark} of
permafrost]{.underline} [[due to its high ice
concentration]{.underline}]{.mark}, and as yedoma melts,
thermokarst---the erosion of soil and sinking of land as ice-rich
permafrost compresses---occurs, which can severely alter landscapes.

[[Permafrost research in Siberia has decreased
without]{.underline}]{.mark} European and **[[US scientists and
funding]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The European Union's International
Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic (INTERACT)
once consisted of 85 research stations around the Arctic. However,
INTERACT has put 21 research stations in Russia on pause. All the
research done at these stations has been halted completely or continued
solely by Russian researchers without EU funding. Similarly, Russia was
the original location of the Woodwell Climate Research Center's US\$41
million Permafrost Pathways project, which aimed to better monitor and
model the carbon emissions from Arctic permafrost. However, the project
has now been relocated to Canada and Alaska.

Direct collaboration between Germany and Russia at Russia's Samoylov
Island Research Station in the Siberian Lena Delta has similarly been
paused following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Alfred Wegener
Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) in Germany, the Arctic and
Antarctic Research Institute in St. Petersburg, and the Melnikov
Permafrost Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Yakutsk have
been collaborating at this station since 1998 and collecting core
samples since 2006. In 2021, researchers associated with AWI found the
oldest recorded sample of permafrost (650,000 years old) in a Siberian
village.

[The halting of Siberian permafrost research has exacerbated existing
issues in collecting data from this region of the Arctic]{.underline}.
[Compared to data from other permafrost regions, many researchers
consider data from Siberia biased]{.underline}. A study published in
Nature Climate Change found that permafrost data collected from INTERACT
stations in Siberia are an inaccurate representation of permafrost
changes in the region. Due to their tendency to be in warmer and wetter
parts of the Arctic with less soil carbon and vegetation compared to the
Arctic on average, the data collected by these stations may
underestimate true carbon emission levels.

[Before the war, efforts had begun to improve data quality]{.underline}.

Infrastructure failure

[Arctic communities rely heavily on the services provided by their
housing, communication, transportation, and energy
infrastructures]{.underline}21. However, [the integrity of the built
environment is jeopardized by permafrost thaw and construction practices
that are not adapted to the current climate]{.underline}. Infrastructure
failures, which impact all aspects of life, were indeed a primary
concern across all the study areas (Fig. 3). The significant costs
incurred by repairs, the implementation of adaptation measures, and the
decommissioning or relocation of infrastructures were concerning for
local experts and governmental entities. For example, in Longyearbyen
(Svalbard, Norway), which is located between steep mountainsides,
landslides, rockfalls and ground surface deformations considerably
impact buildings and infrastructure. Much of the former mining town's
built environment was constructed for temporary use, resulting in a need
for costly adaptation measures. In Ilulissat (Avannaata municipality,
Greenland), where permafrost is relatively ice-rich and close to its
thawing point, [ground surface deformations and associated
infrastructure damages occur seasonally]{.underline}. The demand for
construction and maintenance operations has increased in recent years,
thereby exerting pressure on the local private sector and already
limited municipal budgets.

Damages to the built environment and associated adverse effects have
also impacted the health and well-being of local residents in all the
study areas. However, recognizing hazards has equipped individuals and
communities with the ability to confront and manage them proactively,
fostering a sense of control and preparedness that underpins overall
well-being35,36. Hazardous slope-related processes, including rockfalls
and landslides, notably represented a major safety concern in
Longyearbyen. Similarly, [landslides and tsunamis have become a growing
source of concern]{.underline} in the Avannaata municipality,
particularly following the 2017 Nuugaatsiaq disaster, which resulted in
the destruction of eleven houses and claimed four lives58. In the
Beaufort Sea region and the Mackenzie River Delta (Canada), Bulunskiy
District (Russia), and Longyearbyen, erosion (fluvial or coastal) was a
major concern with respect to infrastructure failure, impacts on
recreational activities, and the need for protective measures. In the
Beaufort Sea/Delta region, [accelerating erosion rates are leading to
the **complete destruction of infrastructure**]{.underline} (Fig. 4) and
contributing to the need for ongoing and planned relocation of homes,
particularly in Tuktoyaktuk59. Coastal erosion is also threatening the
cultural identity and heritage of communities in several regions,
resulting in damage to remnants from the coal mining industry in
Longyearbyen60, cultural heritage sites in the Beaufort Sea/Delta
region24,61, and cemeteries in Bykovskiy (Bulunskiy District, Russia).

#### Permafrost thaw destroys transportation infrastructure

[Thawing permafrost damages transportation infrastructure, as well as
food and water supply facilities]{.underline}. [Extreme weather events
and increased erosion further disrupt navigation, limiting access to
resources]{.underline}18,24. Disruption of mobility and supplies was of
great concern across the study areas. In Longyearbyen, this hazard was
mainly considered to be a function of infrastructure failure. Coastal
erosion has damaged roads, and as the town is located in a valley with
steep hillsides, [permafrost thaw causes landslides and rockfalls, which
have resulted in]{.underline} temporary [road closures]{.underline} and
disruptions of hiking paths. Furthermore, [roads and the airport runway
are at risk from ground surface deformations induced by permafrost
thawing and ground ice melting]{.underline}. The likelihood of supplies
being disrupted was nonetheless considered low in this study area. In
the Avannaata municipality, the deterioration of roads (Fig. 5) was also
a concern, primarily due to the need for frequent repairs, associated
economic consequences (Fig. 6), and a lack of alternative routes to
critical facilities in the case of disruption (e.g., a unique road to
the airport in Ilulissat).

In comparison, disruptions of mobility and supplies occurring within the
Beaufort Sea/Delta Region were perceived as having important impacts on
all life domains, such as being in nature, ecosystem health, and
subsistence practices, which in turn affect culture, language, and
identity. Permafrost thaw results in changes in trails and river
channels, complicating access to camps and creating safety challenges.
Another main concern in this region was the increased costs due to road
damage. In northern Sakha (Yakutiya), [the degradation and destruction
of winter roads, tundra trails and water pipelines and their impacts on
transportation were perceived as major risks]{.underline}. Related
delays and irregular provisioning of groceries, traditional food, and
other goods challenge local food security. In addition, the formation of
thermokarst wetlands or depressions (irregular topography resulting from
the thawing of ice-rich permafrost and subsequent ground surface
deformations62) in the Sakha tundra increased the number of accidents,
changed the mobility patterns of local residents, and altered the
migrations of reindeer and hunting game. Changing seawater turbidity and
salinity drove fish resources and harvesters farther away from the
coast. These new mobility patterns challenge subsistence and commercial
practices, making them less safe and less productive.

As part of this process, we need to ensure that decision makers have a
fundamental understanding of permafrost and its relevance to climate
change. Permafrost is ground that has been continually frozen for at
least two consecutive years and often for thousands of years. Permafrost
extends across the boreal and tundra biomes and in mountain regions
across the globe, underlying roughly 15% of the exposed land surface
area in the Northern Hemisphere (Obu, 2021) and 38% of Alaska's land
area (Pastick et al., 2015). As global temperatures rise, this
once-frozen ground is beginning to thaw, creating an increasingly
unstable and dangerous environment. [[Among the most observable impacts
is thaw-induced ground collapse, which can contribute to the destruction
of infrastructure]{.mark}, homes, schools, medical facilities, roads,
and public utilities that ensure access to electricity, clean water, and
other necessities]{.underline}. [[Permafrost thaw is]{.mark} also

Introduction

Russia's launch of its 'special military operation' against Ukraine and
expansion of NATO with Finland and Sweden's entry into the alliance has
brought new geopolitical complexities to the Arctic. [Emerging military
threat perceptions on both the sides has withered away the significant
level of mutual trust which was built in the]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline} in the post-Cold War period. At this critical
juncture when dialogue and diplomacy between Russia and the West is at
its lowest in the region, there are five key critical aspects that
require revival of regional and global cooperation in the Arctic.

Climate Change Research

[Climate change research has been the]{.underline} [first]{.underline}
and the foremost victim [of]{.underline} the [suspended cooperation in
the Arctic.]{.underline} The Arctic Council, which through its various
working groups dealt in addressing multiple aspects of climate change in
the region, presently remains limited in its operational orientation
under Norwegian chairship. [Most of scientific cooperation with Russia
that existed in the Council prior to Russia--Ukraine conflict presently
remains suspended with no hope of revival in the near
future]{.underline}.

[Russia, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the Arctic
landmass, remains extremely important when it comes to studying the
region from environmental and climate change perspectives]{.underline}.
Current [lack of Russian data and suspension of every kind of scientific
engagements with the Russian scientists has created significant voids in
climate change research]{.underline} over the last two years.1 A recent
study published by Nature Climate Change argues that [much of the
scientific understanding and assessments regarding the climate change in
the Arctic has been based on the in-situ data measured from multiple
ground research stations located in the different parts of the
Arctic]{.underline}.

[As a result of termination of cooperation with the Russian ground-based
stations in the Arctic, Western researchers undertaking scientific
observations from the region are presently relying on satellite
data]{.underline} for their research.2 Scientists argue that [hindrance
in access to onsite crucial data from Russian field sites would limit
the scientific understanding regarding the future trajectory of
environmental and climatic transitions in the region]{.underline}.3
[This could lead to significant biases in scientific experimentation and
research]{.underline}. To highlight the seriousness of the situation,
the scientists in the past have openly emphasised that despite
geopolitical challenges, there is a need for a resumption of academic
relations and scientific collaborations with Russian scholars and
institutions.4 This necessity for revival of such mechanisms arises
manifold as the conflict in Ukraine gets prolonged with no credible
visible end point over the horizon.

Nuclear and Radioactive Waste

The Arctic region (especially the Russian Arctic) in the past has been a
graveyard for dumping nuclear waste. Since the Soviet times, [multiple
sites in the region have witnessed dumping of spent nuclear fuels (both
solid and liquid fuels) either from reactors, or as a result of sunken
nuclear ships, submarines and reactors]{.underline} (some by accidents
and while others were deliberately buried under thick ice) as a result
of its extreme environmental conditions and remoteness. In recent years,
[melting of Arctic ice due to global warming is causing fears regarding
this hazardous nuclear waste, which could pose grave
threats]{.underline} to Arctic environment and mankind.

Scientific experts are of the view that [as global warming accelerates
in the Arctic, challenges from the harmful impacts of radio isotopes
that continue to emit from these buried/sunken nuclear sites remain
extremely high]{.underline}. The April 2024 flooding in the Tomsk region
of Russia caused immense panic among the local residents and the civil
administration because of the amount of the radioactive waste that
remains present in the region. The city of Seversk which is just 15
kilometers north of the city of Tomsk was home to one of the three
production facilities for weapons-grade plutonium for the Soviet Union's
nuclear weapons programme.5 The Siberian Chemical Combine in Seversk
also had five plutonium production reactors, a uranium enrichment plant
and a processing plant for plutonium warheads in the past. As a result,
[a significant amount of nuclear waste to date remains accumulated on
the surface and subsurface in the region.]{.underline}6

Similarly, Russia's Andreyeva Bay which was a former submarine
maintenance yard northwest of Murmansk near the Norwegian border,
accounts for 22,000 spent nuclear fuel assemblies from more than 100
nuclear submarines that continue to pose serious concerns in the region.
In addition to these, the two Russian sunken nuclear submarines K-27 and
K-159 in Kara and Barents Seas respectively, continue to pose serious
threats of radioactivity in the Arctic. A detailed report published by
Bellona, highlights that as per official records, there are presently
six objects lying on Arctic Sea bed with Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF). These
includes SNF in the reactor sections of the nuclear submarines K-19,
K-11 and K-140 and in the sunken submarines K-27 and K(B)-159, along
with one reactor sunken together with the screen assembly of the
icebreaker 'Lenin'7 (see Figure 1).

Undertaking nuclear waste clean-up projects in the Arctic are highly
expensive and require advanced technologies. In the past, some level of
cooperation through Agreement on a Multilateral Nuclear Environmental
Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) existed at operational
levels between Russia and the Western countries that aimed at
eliminating the nuclear waste from multiple Arctic sites. These projects
also included support from political as well as financial institutions
of European Union such as European Commission and European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the European Atomic Energy
Community.8

Post Ukraine--Russia conflict, all such projects have been suspended
with Russia and presently no working level cooperation between Western
states and Russia exists on addressing this critical issue. Russian
plans to raise and scrap nuclear submarines K-27 and B-159 from Arctic
seabed have also taken backseat due to Russia's focus on Ukraine and due
to lack of technological capabilities and amount of funding required for
undertaking such missions. Russia's plans to formally exit from the
MNEPR further raises serious concerns as this would further derail
already limited existing mechanism in place for cooperation that offered
some hopes to address such critical issues in the Arctic.9

Pathogens and Arctic Viruses

[As the melting of the ice accelerates in the Arctic and the
temperatures in the region continue to rise, the possibility and
probabilities of exposure]{.underline} of mankind and animal species [to
the ancient viruses and bacteria that lie beneath the Arctic ice remain
extremely high]{.underline}.10 Siberian Arctic, that as per scientific
beliefs is expected to account for vast traces of such deadly pathogens,
could open new pandora box of challenges in the future. [Scientific
research in the past highlights that the Arctic remains home to zombie
viruses and bacteria of past thousands of years, that remain buried
under its ice and are still infectious. If these come in contact with
human or animal species, it could]{.underline} even [result
in]{.underline} regional and **[global pandemics]{.underline}**.11

Studying the region from such perspectives remains extremely important
and presently there exists serious research gaps in these domains.
[Undertaking scientific research on such issues requires global
scientific cooperation, unhindered access to remote sites in the Arctic
for collection of specimen, university and laboratory collaborations and
sharing mechanisms with unrestricted access of data among scientists
undertaking research in these domains]{.underline}. It is only through
enabling of [such working mechanisms]{.underline} in place that the
mankind [could be prepared well in advance from]{.underline} potential
regional and [global pandemics]{.underline}.

Human Security in the Arctic

Arctic communities and local population are the frontline victims to
some of the above discussed emerging transitions in the region. For
them, the suspension of existing mechanisms of cooperation matters the
most. Arctic region combinedly as a whole accounts for four million
people. Of this, nearly 500,000 (around 11 per cent) are Arctic
indigenous communities spread across three continents and 30 million km2
of Arctic landmass. Russia alone accounts of nearly half of this total
Arctic population while the other half remains scattered among other
seven Arctic states.12

Post Ukraine crisis, the real issues of these Arctic communities that
primarily revolve around the 'human security dimensions' (addressing key
issues related to their health, food security, employment, social
security, gender issues, securing indigenous way of livelihood and so
on), have been overpowered by state-centric traditional
discourses/notions of security.13 These traditional notions of security
that primarily revolves around securing 'state sovereignty' from
possible threats of invasion by 'external aggressor' (in this case
Russia) mainly dominate security discourses in the Arctic.

Therefore, other Arctic states' natural response to secure themselves
from such perceived threats of possible adversaries in the Arctic has
been via strengthening and upgrading of their military infrastructure
capabilities in the region. Similar state-centric approaches undertaken
by all Arctic states to address their own security concerns from their
perceived adversary/ies has resulted in rapid military build-ups in the
region.

Such discourses have completely sidelined the 'human dimensions' to
security in the Arctic. Mads Qvist Frederiksen, Executive Director,
Arctic Economic Council during the Arctic Security Conference in Oslo
pointed that on the one hand, local business communities remain deprived
from global business opportunities due to lack of adequate road
infrastructure in the Arctic while at the same time, F-35 fighter jets
are practicing to land on highways in Finland.14

There is no denial to the fact the post Ukraine--Russia conflict, such
approaches to security are natural response of state as a result of the
ongoing global geopolitical turmoil. But the human dimensions to
security in the Arctic still remain of utmost importance that
could/should not be ignored by states in the region. The thresholds of
these aspects of human security could vary from state to state in the
Arctic, but [there persist multiple common challenges of existential
nature among all Arctic communities that need common solutions and
cooperative regional approaches.]{.underline}

Emerging Division/Rifts in the Arctic Governance

Till 2022, the Arctic Council remained an important mechanism to address
non-military related aspects in the Arctic. Geopolitical divides and the
present state of affairs within the working groups of the council has
hampered the scientific progress and cooperation by regional states in
the Arctic. Many non-Arctic states have also become vulnerable to the
impact of this suspended cooperation. As a result of current state of
the Arctic Council, presently, there exists no formal mechanism in place
for non-Arctic states to raise their concerns related to Arctic science
and climate change or either make proposal for undertaking scientific
research activity in the region.

Secondly, [though independent scientific cooperation at bilateral and
multilateral levels between the non-Arctic states and the A7 countries
does persist, any attempts to forge cooperation with Russia on similar
lines is seen through critical geopolitical lens and traditional
narratives of 'us' vs 'them']{.underline}. Non-Arctic states, especially
those that maintain independent foreign policy approach towards both
Russia and West, remain exposed to the emerging scientific gaps in the
Arctic. Arctic Council presently remains highjacked by regional
geopolitical agendas and currently all permanent member Arctic states
other than Russia in the council are NATO members. Russia, which has
formally exited from most of the other mechanism of cooperation in the
Arctic, still remains party to the council which gives some hope for the
revival of the council.

Despite this optimism, there are debates in global media whether Russia
could possibly form its own parallel structure of Arctic governance
similar to Arctic Council with like-minded Asian states from BRICS
nations. It is, however, important to argue that if Arctic Council
continues to fail its mandates in new upcoming chairmanships,
possibilities of such new formats cannot be ruled out.

A Way Forward

Though the ongoing geopolitical realities with regard to Russia--Ukraine
conflict cannot be ignored, [termination of engagements at academic and
scientific levels make no sense for a region as a whole that is on a
cusp of bigger common threats of **existential nature**]{.underline} to
mankind. [Calls for revival of cooperation in the region on scientific
matters cannot be ignored.]{.underline}15 If the current situation
persists longer in the Arctic, [50 per cent of the Russian Arctic that
is emerging as a critical blind spot in terms of observations and
scientific assessments would deprive future policymakers of efficient
decision-making]{.underline}.

### Pandemic risk high

#### Zombie virus risk is accelerating as permafrost melts

Ben **Cost**, 20**22** -- features reporter at the New York Post.
"Scientists warn long-frozen 'zombie virus' is 'public health threat'
amid thaw" New York Post, 11/28,
<https://nypost.com/2022/11/28/long-frozen-zombie-virus-is-public-health-threat-amid-thaw/>
//DH

They're potentially prying open Pandora's pox.

[French scientists have sparked fears of yet another pandemic after
reviving a "zombie virus" that had been trapped under a frozen lake in
Russia for]{.underline} a record [50,000 years.]{.underline}

"[The situation would be much more disastrous in the case of plant,
animal, or human diseases caused by the revival of an ancient unknown
virus]{.underline}," reads the "viral" study, which has yet to be
peer-reviewed. The [new research was helmed by
microbiologist]{.underline} Jean-Marie [Alempic from the French National
Centre for Scientific Research]{.underline}, Science Alert reported.

According to the preliminary paper, [global warming is causing vast
swaths of the permafrost]{.underline} --- permanently frozen ground
covering one-quarter of the Northern Hemisphere --- [to irreversibly
thaw. This has had the alarming effect of "releasing organic matter
frozen for up to a million years" --- including]{.underline} potentially
harmful [pathogens.]{.underline}

"Part of this organic matter also consists of revived cellular microbes
(prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes) as well as viruses that remained
dormant since prehistorical times," the researchers write.

Aix-Marseille University professor Jean-Michel Claverie, co-author of
the study, issued a warning to medical authorities about the lack of
significant updates on "live" viruses in permafrost since original
studies in 2014 and 2015, the Sun reported. "This wrongly suggests that
such occurrences are rare and that 'zombie viruses' are not a public
health threat," the research team wrote in their findings.

[In order to study these awakening organisms, scientists
have,]{.underline} perhaps paradoxically, [revived some of these
so-called "zombie viruses" from the Siberian permafrost]{.underline}.
The oldest --- dubbed Pandoravirus yedoma after the mythological
character Pandora, whose curiosity led her to open a box of trouble, and
the type of soil it was found in --- was 48,500 years old, a record age
for a frozen virus returning to a state where it has the potential to
infect other organisms. This shatters the previous record held by a
30,000-year-old virus discovered by the same team in Siberia in 2013.

The new strain is one of 13 viruses outlined in the study, each of which
possessed its own genome, Science Alert reported. While the Pandoravirus
was discovered below the bottom of a lake in Yukechi Alas in Yakutia,
Russia, others have been found everywhere from mammoth fur to the
intestines of a Siberian wolf.

[After studying the live cultures, scientists found that all the "zombie
viruses" have the potential to be infectious]{.underline}, and are
therefore a "health threat." They postulate that [we could see more
COVID-19-style pandemics]{.underline} in the future [as ever-melting
permafrost continues to release long-dormant viruses]{.underline} like a
microbial Captain America.

"It is therefore legitimate to ponder the risk of ancient viral
particles remaining infectious and getting back into circulation by the
thawing of ancient permafrost layers," they write. Unfortunately, it's a
vicious cycle as organic matter released by the thawing ice decomposes
into carbon dioxide and methane, further enhancing the greenhouse effect
and accelerating the melt.

[The newly thawed virus might only be the tip of the epidemiological
iceberg]{.underline} as there are likely more hibernating viruses yet to
be discovered.

"If the authors are indeed isolating live viruses from ancient
permafrost, it is likely that the even smaller, simpler mammalian
viruses would also survive frozen for eons," University of California
virologist Eric Delwart told New Scientist.

#### Arctic is at high risk of zoonotic disease

//DH

Animals and Arctic diseases

Along with shipping and development, [there is a third major disease
pipeline into and out of the world's Arctic regions:
zoonosis]{.underline}. Some [60 percent of known and 75 percent of
emerging human pathogens have jumped from other animals to
humans.]{.underline} In lower latitudes, bird flu has already jumped
from birds to cattle and from cattle to humans. Cats and dogs have also
been exposed. In the Arctic, domestic animals are already known to have
exchanged pathogens with marine mammals.

Ashley Barratclough, a veterinarian with the National Marine Mammal
Foundation in San Diego, studies disease transmission among Arctic
mammals. She is concerned about Pacific orca, for example, traveling
farther into the Arctic Ocean as waters warm to prey on bowhead whales.
She says, "[Climate change \[is\] opening up for the first time for
these species to interact and \[for their diseases to\] cross
over.]{.underline} That to me is a much bigger concern than the ice
melting \[and\] releasing a pathogen from a dead body. We often refer to
marine mammals as the sentinels of the ocean, and it's a matter of time
before they're going to be affecting people." The place to monitor the
danger, she says, is among subsistence hunters and herders, who are the
frontline humans at most risk from zoonosis. Herders are especially
vulnerable in the Nordic Arctic and Russia's vast permafrost region.

[The wild unpredictability of zoonosis is one of the reasons it keeps
many infectious disease experts up at night]{.underline}. A potential
brake on it, says Barratclough, is that a pathogen---say, bird
flu---jumping species may become "deadly in one species but not
necessarily the other." For example, she adds, "Influenza can be highly
pathogenic in birds but not necessarily in marine mammals." This also
might be true for humans but is not certain and cannot be taken for
granted for all diseases.

More recently, scientists found remarkable genetic compatibility between
viruses isolated from lake sediments in the high Arctic and potential
living hosts.

[Earth's climate is warming at a spectacular rate,]{.underline} and up
to four times faster in colder regions such as the Arctic. Estimates
suggest [we can expect **four sextillion**]{.underline}
(4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) [microorganisms to be released from ice
melt each year.]{.underline} This is about the same as the estimated
number of stars in the universe.

However, despite the unfathomably large number of microorganisms being
released from melting ice (including pathogens that can potentially
infect modern species), no one has been able to estimate the risk this
poses to modern ecosystems.

In a new study published today in the journal PLOS Computational
Biology, [we calculated the ecological risks posed by the release of
unpredictable ancient viruses]{.underline}.

[Our simulations show that 1% of simulated releases of just one dormant
pathogen could cause major environmental damage and the widespread loss
of host organisms around the world]{.underline}.

Digital worlds

We used a software called Avida to run experiments that simulated the
release of one type of ancient pathogen into modern biological
communities.

We then measured the impacts of this invading pathogen on the diversity
of modern host bacteria in thousands of simulations, and compared these
to simulations where no invasion occurred.

The invading pathogens often survived and evolved in the simulated
modern world. About 3% of the time the pathogen became dominant in the
new environment, in which case they were very likely to cause losses to
modern host diversity.

In the worst- (but still entirely plausible) case scenario, the invasion
reduced the size of its host community by 30% when compared to controls.

The risk from this small fraction of pathogens might seem small, but
keep in mind these are the results of releasing just one particular
pathogen in simulated environments. [With the sheer number of ancient
microbes being released in the real world, such outbreaks represent a
substantial danger]{.underline}.

### Russia key - disease

#### Russian permafrost has the greatest risk of disease

**Clavarie = Jean-Michel Claverie, a French microbiologist from
Aix-Marseille University**

[[Claverie first showed "live" viruses could be extracted from the
Siberian permafrost]{.mark} and successfully revived in
2014.]{.underline} For safety reasons his research focused only on
viruses capable of infecting amoebas, which are far enough removed from
the human species to avoid any risk of inadvertent contamination. But he
felt the scale of the public health threat the findings indicated had
been under-appreciated or mistakenly considered a rarity.

So, in 2019, his team proceeded to isolate 13 new viruses, including one
frozen under a lake more than 48,500 years ago, from seven different
ancient Siberian permafrost samples --- evidence to their ubiquity.
Publishing the findings in a 2022 study, he emphasized [that [a viral
infection from an unknown, ancient pathogen]{.mark} in humans, animals
or plants [could have]{.mark} potentially "[disastrous"
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

"50,000 years back in time takes us to when Neanderthal disappeared from
the region," he says. "If Neanderthals died of an unknown viral disease
and this virus resurfaces, it could be a danger to us."

[[Permafrost,]{.mark} soil that was once teeming with animal life,
[provides the perfect conditions for preserving organic matter]{.mark}:
it's natural, dark, devoid of oxygen and allows for very little chemical
activity]{.underline}[. [In Siberia,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[it can reach
up to a kilometer deep --- the]{.mark} [only place in the world where
permafrost goes down that far ---]{.mark} and covers around two thirds
of Russian territory]{.underline}. Just one gram was found to harbor
thousands of dormant microbe species, according to a paper published in
Nature journal in 2021.

For 400,000 years, underlying permafrost layers have been largely
stable. So much so, Russian towns have sprouted-up across Siberia,
drilling their foundations deep into the concrete-like frozen soil. But
now, with the Arctic warming faster than any other area on earth, vast
methane craters have opened up across the region and entire towns are
subsiding.

More recently, geopolitics have created new blind spots. [Organizing
trips to Siberia and collaborating with Russian labs was not easy even
before Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline} in February 2022. [But
c[ommunications]{.mark} with former colleagues and collaborators in the
country [have]{.mark} now practically [ground to a
halt.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Claverie's laboratory]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[along with many others]{.mark} across the Western world]{.underline},
[[are **government funded**.]{.mark} "[We've been told not to talk with
Russians anymore]{.mark}]{.underline}," he says.

The effects of global warming on Siberia pose both risks and rewards for
the Russian economy. Thawing permafrost is estimated to be putting
around \$250 billion worth of infrastructure at risk and is already
thought to have contributed to environmental disasters like the Norilsk
oil spill in 2020, as the ground becomes unstable.

Yet the region also boasts a wealth of natural resources --- coal,
natural gas, gold, diamond and iron ore. Unlike in other
permafrost-covered regions like Alaska and Greenland, Claverie says
Russia has been more active in mining these soils: "They are digging
holes everywhere."

Some scientists also fear that [technology]{.underline} --- such as
Russia's floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov --- [could
transform previously unreachable areas along Siberia's coastline into
mining hubs as ice-free routes through the Arctic circle increase
accessibility]{.underline}. [Mining these deeper depths]{.underline},
beyond the active layer that thaws every summer, [would increase the
possibility for human interaction with a potentially harmful ancient
pathogen]{.underline}, Claverie says.

#### Siberia is a unique risk factor for zombie viruses

zombie viruses in Siberia could spark terrifying new pandemic,
scientists warn" The Guardian, 1/21,

//DH

[Humanity is facing a bizarre new pandemic threat,]{.underline}
scientists have warned. [[Ancient viruses frozen in the Arctic
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark} [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} one day [be
released by Earth's warming climate and [unleash a major disease
outbreak]{.mark}]{.underline}, they say.

[Strains of these]{.underline} Methuselah microbes -- or [zombie
viruses]{.underline} as they are also known -- [have already been
isolated by researchers who have raised fears that a new global medical
emergency]{.underline} could be triggered -- not by an illness new to
science but by a disease from the distant past.

As a result, [scientists have begun planning an Arctic monitoring
network]{.underline} that would pinpoint early cases of a disease caused
by ancient micro-organisms. Additionally, it would provide quarantine
and expert medical treatment for infected people in a bid to contain an
outbreak, and prevent infected people from leaving the region.

"At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus on diseases that
might emerge in southern regions and then spread north," said geneticist
Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University. "By contrast, little
attention has been given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far
north and then travel south -- and that is an oversight, I believe.
There are viruses up there that have the potential to infect humans and
start a new disease outbreak."

This point was backed by virologist Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus
Medical Center in Rotterdam. "We don't know what viruses are lying out
there in the permafrost but I think there is a real risk that there
might be one capable of triggering a disease outbreak -- say of an
ancient form of polio. We have to assume that something like this could
happen."

In 2014, Claverie led a team of scientists who isolated live viruses in
Siberia and showed they could still infect single-cell organisms -- even
though they had been buried in permafrost for thousands of years.
Further [[research, published last year, revealed the existence of
several different viral strains from seven different sites **in
Siberia**]{.underline}]{.mark} and showed these could infect cultured
cells. One virus sample was 48,500 years old.

"The viruses we isolated were only able to infect amoebae and posed no
risk to humans," said Claverie. "However, that does not mean that other
viruses -- currently frozen in the permafrost -- might not be able to
trigger illnesses in humans. We have identified genomic traces of
poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known human pathogens, for
example."

Permafrost covers a fifth of the northern hemisphere and is made up of
soil that has been kept at temperatures below zero for long periods.
Some layers have remained frozen for hundreds of thousands of years,
scientists have discovered.

"The crucial point about [permafrost is]{.underline} that it is [cold,
dark and lacks oxygen, which is perfect for preserving biological
material]{.underline}," Claverie told the Observer last week. "You could
put a yoghurt in permafrost and it might still be edible 50,000 years
later."

[But the world's permafrost is changing. The upper layers of the
planet's main reserves -- in Canada, Siberia and Alaska -- are
melting]{.underline} as climate change affects the Arctic
disproportionately. According to meteorologists, the region is heating
up several times faster than the average rate of increase in global
warming.

However, it is not melting permafrost directly that poses the most
immediate risk, added Claverie. "The danger comes from another global
warming impact: the disappearance of Arctic sea ice. That is allowing
increases in shipping, traffic and industrial development in Siberia.
Huge mining operations are being planned, and are going to drive vast
holes into the deep permafrost to extract oil and ores.

"Those operations will release vast amounts of pathogens that still
thrive there. [Miners will walk in and breath the viruses. The effects
could be calamitous."]{.underline}

This point was stressed by Koopmans. "[[If you look at the history of
epidemic outbreaks, one of the key drivers has been change in land
use]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nipah virus was spread by fruit bats who were
driven from their habitats by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has been
linked to the spread of urbanisation in Africa. And [[that is what we
are about to witness in the Arctic: a complete change in land
use]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that could be dangerous, as we have seen
elsewhere."

[Scientists believe that permafrost]{.underline} -- at its deepest
levels -- [[may contain viruses that are up to a **million years
old**]{.underline}]{.mark} and so will be far older than our own
species, which is thought to have emerged about 300,000 years ago.

"[[Our immune systems may have never been in contact with some of those
microbes]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that is another worry," said
Claverie. "The scenario of an unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal
coming back at us, although unlikely, has become a real possibility."

For that reason, Claverie and others are working with UArctic, the
University of the Arctic -- an international educational network in the
polar region -- on plans to establish quarantine facilities and provide
medical expertise that could pinpoint early cases and treat them locally
to try to contain the infection.

"We now face a tangible threat and we need to be prepared to deal with
it. It is as simple as that."

The bear in the room

[[When it comes to]{.mark} dealing with the potential [disease
dangers]{.mark} emanating [from a warming Arctic, there is a giant bear
in the room.]{.mark} Many researchers are frustrated because they cannot
get data or cooperation out of Russia]{.underline}. Romanovsky, a
Russian native, was formerly affiliated with Moscow State University,
but he can no longer do research in Russia, he says ruefully, because he
gave an interview to a radio program considered "undesirable" and could
be sentenced to five years in a Russian prison for it.

[[Knowledge of public health in the Russian Arctic has
atrophied]{.mark}. R]{.underline}ussia aims to extract resources,
ignoring economic constraints and disregarding international
environmental and public health codes, Romanovsky says. [[It may
be]{.mark} **[the most important region]{.mark}** [to monitor, but also
remains the least likely to be monitored]{.mark} or share its data
internationally]{.underline}. [Russia's willful isolation affects every
aspect of climate change in the Arctic]{.underline}, including its
potential role in pathogens' evolution and migration.

[The lack of plentiful and robust data means that it is almost
impossible to attach a realistic probability of risk to the possible
emergence of Arctic pathogens]{.underline}. But we know that human
activity---development, shipping, extraction, hunting---creates
favorable conditions for microbial spread and evolution, and we know the
Arctic is entering a phase in which human activities are expanding. The
world can't afford to allow uncertainty, lack of data, and disciplinary
siloes to obscure the range of possible ways microbes will behave in the
altered Arctic that is shaping up. They are the most resilient entities
on our planet, after all.

Humans living in the Arctic have in recent centuries built their
residences, businesses, and other infrastructure atop permafrost, which
served as a sort of perpetual foundation. Now, as climate change
proceeds, permafrost is collapsing across the North, destroying water
systems, roads, buildings, and pipelines and leading to contamination of
areas humans use. [Permafrost collapse generates new lakes that can join
up with surface streams and carry microbes into the ocean]{.underline}.
Open-pit mines, eroded bluffs, and sinkholes expose ancient organic
matter. [In addition to bacteria and viruses, fungi, lichens, and even
nematode worms have been revived from permafrost]{.underline}. So while
there is some reason to avoid panic about zombie microbes, humans do
face the possibility of meeting up with the vast, newly exposed
microbial storehouse released from permafrost.

Potential [pathogens could move into and out of the Arctic in multiple
ways. Ships' ballast water transports invasive species, including
microbes. Animal carriers]{.underline}, especially rodents like beaver,
rats and rabbits, [bring southern pathogens]{.underline} like giardia,

subjection to long-term stress. [[These worries drew more attention
following the]{.mark} death of a child by ancient anthrax spores in
Siberian in 2016 and [the reconstruction of smallpox and Spanish flu
genomes from ancient frozen biological samples]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
present review illustrates some examples of recently recovered pathogens
after being buried for millions of years, including some identified
viable ancient viruses, bacteria and even other forms of life. While
some pathogens could be revived, genomes of other ancient pathogens
which could not be revived were re-constructed. The present study aims
to highlight and alarm the hidden aspect of global warming on the
international public health, which represents future threats from the
past for humanity.

Introduction

[With the continuous evolution and emergence of new unknown
pathogens]{.underline} in the last decades, such as SARS, MERS, Ebola,
and recently SARS2 (Covid-19), [it is clear that international public
health faces severe challenges]{.underline}. However, [the re-emergence
of serious infectious diseases which were previously partially or
completely eradicated represents a similar public health hazard. One of
the main reasons for the re-occurrence of eradicated diseases is
attributed to the global warming.]{.underline} Among the most
underestimated harmful effects of the global warming is the melting of
the ice layer and the release of buried materials since decades
including radioactive wastes (Colgan et al. 2016), and liberates
billions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane gas into the air
(Knoblauch et al. 2018), and could even release a huge amount of trapped
heavy metals to the surrounding environment and groundwater (McConnell
et al. 2018).

[Thawing of frozen snow may also liberate frozen biological materials
since tens and hundreds of thousands of years, including ancient viruses
and bacteria.]{.underline} Microbiological examination of tissue samples
obtained from a frozen mammoth in Siberian revealed the presence of
members of the genera Carnobacterium and Lactosphera, which could be
cultured on anaerobic media (El-Sayed and Kamel 2020; Pikuta et al.
2011). Similarly, examination of the gut microbiome of the frozen body
of rhinoceros, which represents another extinct animal species, could
detect the presence of Firmicutes (mainly members of the family
Clostridiaceae), Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, TM7, and Bacteroidetes
(Mardanov et al. 2012). Ancient bacteria were also isolated from
environmental samples rather than the bodies of frozen animals. [[The
diversity of newly detected bacterial species in ice is huge]{.mark}.
Climatic changes that may lead to thawing of ice and the revival of
bacteria will have potential effects with unexpected
consequences]{.underline}. (Brouchkov et al. 2017). A 300,000-years-old
virus and 8 million years old bacteria could be isolated from Siberian
and Antarctica, respectively. Fourteen bacterial isolates could also be
isolated from 750,000-year-old ice samples obtained from the Tibetan
Plateau. In 2016, ancient anthrax spores stored in frozen soil in
Siberian resulted in the death of a child died and hospitalization of an
additional 20 persons (El-Sayed and Kamel 2020; Christner et al. 2003).
However, [the melted snow also released unknown bacteria/viruses that
were trapped and preserved for]{.underline} thousands and possibly
[millions of years]{.underline}. Microbiological investigation of ice
samples obtained from the Tibetan Plateau revealed four types of known
viruses in addition to 28 novel viral genera and abundant bacteria.
Similarly, the investigation of frozen samples from Siberia described
for the first time a 30,000-year-old giant virus. The virus retained its
viability and infectivity (Legendre et al. 2015).

The international worry is not only limited to the revival of unknown
ancient viruses but also pathogens which were already eradicated. Fatal
pathogens as smallpox may re-emerge from a mummified corpse (Reardon
2014).

Various bacteria respond to environmental stress by entering a viable
non-culturable state (VBNC) (McDougald et al. 1999), even the presence
of killed/non-viable bacterial DNA in the melted ice represents a great
threat according to the concept of Griffith's experiment. In 1928,
Frederick Griffith mixed a heat-killed rough strain with a smooth strain
of Streptococcus pneumoniae and injected the mixture in a mouse. The
mouse died due to bacterial transformation. It is worth mentioning that
killed microbes in glacial ice are very well preserved due to the
sub-zero temperature by (Griffiths 2000). Moreover, the revived ancient
bacteria were subjected to stress for many thousands and probably
millions of years which improved their ability to survive and overcome
unsuitable environmental conditions. Among the developed survival
mechanisms of newly discovered bacteria is their ability to resist the
damaging effect of antibiotics (Petrova et al. 2011; D\'Costa et al.
2011).

Identification of viable ancient viruses

The high robustness of smallpox virus (variola) enabled the virus to
survive under different unfavourable conditions. Remnants of smallpox
DNA could be detected around the world. The viral DNA could be
identified in skin lesions of the 3200-year-old mummy of Rameses V in
Egypt (Reardon 2014).

In 1991, in a small village near the North Pole, Russian experts
discovered a wooden vault which was full of frozen victims who died from
smallpox in the nineteenth century during the smallpox epidemic there.
This discovery arose the question about the possible comeback of
smallpox following floods induced by glacial ice thawing due to global
warming. This worry is justified by the robust properties of smallpox
and its ability to withstand freezing for a long time (Stone 2002;
Ambrose 2011; Biagini et al. 2012).

Although all attempts to isolate viable variola from preserved human
scabs and corpses were not successful, the viral genome could be
re-construct through sequencing the detected DNA fragments, which
represents a huge threat for public health (Reardon 2014; Duggan et al.
2016). Like smallpox virus, different influenza viruses are also known
to persist natural freezing for a long time (Zhang et al. 2006). In
1997, several trials were attempted to revive the 1918 pandemic
influenza virus from frozen samples. Although these trials failed to
achieve their goal, they could partially sequence and characterize
partial sequences of the restored RNA (Taubenberger 1997; Reid et al.
1999). The trials continued later with the development of reverse
genetics technology where the virus could be completely re-constructed
(Taubenberger et al. 2007, 2012). Additional unknown viruses could also
be detected in a 700-year-old caribou frozen stool which was stored in a
permanent ice layer. Two viruses (RNA and DNA viruses) could be
recovered and characterized in two different laboratories from the
frozen faecal sample (Ng et al. 2014).

One of the oldest viable viruses was detected in ice samples obtained
from Greenland. Various genotypes of the plant virus (Tomato mosaic
tobamovirus) could be identified in approximately 140,000-year-old ice
layers. The highly conserved viruses are characterized by their high
stability and their wide host range (Castello et al. 1999).

The newly discovered ancestral amoeba-infecting DNA viruses (Pithovirus
sibericum and Mollivirus sibericum viruses) are estimated to be older
than 30,000 years old. It belongs to an unknown type of giant viruses.
They are among the largest viruses ever known and can even be seen under
a light microscope. Although Pithovirus sibericum is 1.5 μm in length,
its genome is relatively small (approximately 600 kb) packaged in
uniquely amphora-like shaped particles. The virus kept its viability and
infectivity (Legendre et al. 2014, 2015.

Another virus (Emiliania huxleyi virus) was also detected in
7000-year-old sediment samples obtained from the Black Sea. The obtained
data confirmed the ability of the virus to survive hard environmental
conditions for centuries (Coolen 2011).

As the viruses are defined as particles that are not alive outside the
living organism, their survival over thousands of years was not a big
surprise. The survival of ancient frozen bacteria over millions of years
despite the hard environmental conditions was not expected to date. The
adverse environmental conditions include not only the low temperature
but also the absence of nutrients and sources of energy, in addition to
the increase in the concentration of nascent oxygen at low temperature
(which has a damaging effect on bacterial DNA /RNA and proteins).
However, the bacteria could maintain their metabolic activities, could
grow, and even could multiply through the development of novel metabolic
survival strategies, such as methanogenesis in addition to their
potential DNA repair mechanisms in association with high-stress
tolerance (Lewis et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2007; Vishnivetskaya et al.
2000; Tuorto et al. 2014; Hultman et al. 2015).

It is also worth mentioning that viable bacteria could be detected not
only in frozen ice but also in ancient highly preserved fossils.
Bacillus sphaericus and Staphylococcus succinus could be revived and
cultured from 25 to 40 million-year-old Dominican amber (Greenblatt et
al. 1999).

Identification of viable ancient bacteria

[Ancient DNA fragments from various human pathogens could be extracted
and identified]{.underline}. Some of these DNA fragments originated from
the Bronze Age. Among the identified pathogens are DNA from
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Vibrio cholerae,
Yersinia pestis, and Helicobacter pylori (Margaryan et al. 2018).

Generally, the isolation of various gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria from ancient ice samples has been previously reported. In
Siberian samples, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria was much
higher than gram-positive ones. The majority of these isolates were
identified as Arthrobacter (Actinobacteria) and Planococcus (Firmicutes)
(Shi et al. 1997; Hinsa-Leasure et al. 2010).

Few pockets of 34-million-year old ice layers in the Antarctic continent
are still preserved. Investigation of the ice samples revealed the
presence of viable metabolically active bacteria, which are estimated to
be 8 million years old. These bacteria are among the oldest known living
organisms on earth. The revival of the bacteria was only possible
following long incubation at 4 °C in the dark. Sequencing of the DNA of
the revived bacteria identified them as Arthrobacter roseus (Bidle et
al. 2007). Relatively younger viable bacteria which are 3.5 million
years could also be isolated from Eastern Siberia. Sample examination
detected various archaea, phototrophic cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and
even protozoa in addition to heterogeneous bacterial species in the
samples. The isolated bacteria belonged mainly to gram-negative members.
The majority of isolates could be identified as Arthrobacter
phenanthrenivorans, Subtercola frigoramans, and Glaciimonas immobilis
(Zhang et al. 2013).

Meanwhile, viable and highly robust 3.5-million-year old strains of
Bacillus sp., including Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis, were
reported (Nicholson et al. 2000; Fursova et al. 2012). The dominance of
spore-forming bacteria in ancient Canadian ice samples was also
reported. This is attributed to their ability to withstand hard
environmental conditions (Steven et al. 2007).

On the other hand, microbiological examination of 3.5-million-year old
samples from Eastern Siberia revealed the absolute dominance of
microbial members of three phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and
Firmicutes (representing about 99% of the identified bacterial
population). In contrast, the remaining 1% was represented by members of
Deinococcus-Thermus, Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast, Fusobacteria, and
Acidobacteria. In turn, members of the families Chitinophagaceae,
Caulobacteraceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and
Halomonadaceae clearly dominated over other microbes (Brouchkov et al.
2017).

Younger samples from Northeast Eurasia (approximately 3 million years
old) were also examined. Characterization of the cultured bacteria
revealed three major lineages: gamma-Proteobacteria (mainly
Xanthomonadaceae), Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. In addition, various
aerobes could be isolated from the ice samples including Actinomycetales
(Arthrobacter and Microbacteriaceae); Firmicutes (Exiguobacterium and
Planomicrobium); Bacteroidetes (Flavobacterium); and finally alpha- and
gamma-Proteobacteria represented by Sphingomonas and Psychrobacter,
respectively (Vishnivetskaya et al. 2006). About 30% of the grown
bacteria could build endospores. The isolated bacteria from the same
location showed variation according to the age of the samples. In
contrast, the older samples (up to 3 million years) revealed mainly
high-GC gram-positive bacteria; in addition to beta- and
gamma-Proteobacteria, younger samples from the region (up to 8000 years)
contained mainly low-GC gram-positive bacteria (Shi et al. 1997). At the
same time, the microbial diversity of younger samples clearly increased,
while the prevalence of spore-forming bacteria in the microbial
population decreased. The same findings were also observed in ice
samples originating from Siberia, Canada, and Norway, where the
spore-forming bacteria (mainly Clostridia and Bacilli) were more
prevalent in ice layers (up to 33,000 years old), while
non-spore-forming species dominated in older samples (about 600,000
years old) (Liang et al. 2019).

Identification of other forms of life

The melted ancient ice samples contain not only viruses and bacteria but
also fungi, amoeba, nematodes, and even arthropods. In 2013, a
mycological examination of ancient Siberian permafrost sediment detected
different fungal species which were viable and metabolically active
(Zhang et al. 2013).

Similarly, various viable amoebae strains representing unknown species
from the genus Flamella (Amoebozoa, Variosea) could be isolated from
frozen Arctic samples. Although the amoebae cysts were conserved over
thousands of years in frozen ice, they kept their viability and ability
to divide (Shmakova et al. 2016). Similarly, examination of 30,000 to
40,000-year-old permafrost deposit samples could also detect viable
nematodes (Panagrolaimus aff. Detritophagus (Rhabditida) and Plectus
aff. Parvus (Plectida)) (Shatilovich et al. 2018). They were found to be
very tolerant to hard environmental conditions and low temperatures up
to − 80 °C (Kagoshima et al. 2012). In addition, ice samples from
Antarctica harboured freeze-tolerant arthropods such as the midges
Belgica antarctica and Eretmoptera murphyi (Teets and Denlinger 2014).

In conclusion, [the consequences of global warming on international
public health are still underestimated. The [climatic changes have now
been shown to influence various aspects of human and animal health and
represent a **serious threat to the existence of

During the summer of 2016, in Russia's arctic Yamal Peninsula, [a heat
wave resurfaced anthrax bacteria long buried in the
permafrost.]{.underline} The bacteria then killed thousands of reindeer
and affected nearly a hundred local residents---the first large outbreak
of anthrax in the region since 1941. The world reacted with concerned
curiosity: What other viruses and bacteria could the thawing permafrost
bring back to life? Microbiologists and cold region experts have since
set out to deepen our understanding of how [changes to climate and
weather]{.underline} patterns [in the Arctic may increase human and
animal exposure to novel]{.underline}---or really, really
old---[pathogens freed from dormancy]{.underline}.

Over the last few decades, the international community has dedicated
significant resources to building up networks to detect and combat
tropical disease. But [the 2016 anthrax outbreak, along with research on
other viral strains recovered from permafrost since, shows just how
important scientific cooperation and public health surveillance are in
polar regions.]{.underline}

Monitoring public health in the Arctic is challenging. The region is
home to about 4 million people scattered across roughly 6 million square
miles. Unlike the global commons of Antarctica, the Arctic is comprised
of sovereign territories and exclusive economic zones of eight nations.
Nonetheless, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Arctic public health analyses
were based on data disaggregated at national, regional, and local
levels; the cooperation, transparency, and communication required for
this joint activity were themselves important feats of pan-Arctic
collaboration. Another accomplishment is the International Circumpolar
Surveillance program, which monitors the spread of pneumococcal,
meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae bacteria through a network,
launched in 1999, of hospitals and public health offices in seven of the
eight Arctic states---all but Russia.

Until the 1990s, the Russian Federation's infectious disease control
systems evolved independently from Western public health systems, making
cross-border surveillance and cooperation difficult. But when a sharp
rise in diseases including HIV and tuberculosis in the Baltic Sea and
Barents Sea regions demanded joint action on control and prevention, a
process for collaboration began. Eventually, a rising interdependence on
such international collaboration shifted Russia's foreign policy
strategy for health toward multilateral and bilateral diplomacy.

Today, [new geopolitical tensions are renewing complications in
scientific and health cooperation with Russia. When Russia invaded
Ukraine]{.underline} in February 2022, the [Arctic states]{.underline}
of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the United
States [suspended the Arctic Council's cooperation with
Russia]{.underline}. In the months since, [Russia has threatened to
withdraw from the Arctic Council,]{.underline} the leading
intergovernmental forum for the region. In September 2023, it formally
withdrew from the 30-year-old Barents Euro-Arctic Council.

At the same time, warming temperatures in the Arctic are opening sea
routes and allowing new access to natural resources, prompting increased
traffic and cooperation between Arctic and non-Arctic states. Climate
change is destabilizing the health, food security, and livelihoods of
people in the area. We argue that, [in mutually dependent regions like
the Arctic, scientific research on climate and health can sustain
channels for diplomacy]{.underline}. Indeed, [new]{.underline}---even
experimental---[strategies for cooperation are necessary]{.underline} at
this critical time.

Cooperation and competition in the Arctic

The Arctic Council was established in 1996 as a high-level
intergovernmental forum for the eight countries with Arctic territory
and the six Indigenous people's organizations granted "permanent
participant" status. The council promotes cooperation, coordination, and
communication among Arctic states, Indigenous communities, and the rest
of the Arctic population on issues including sustainable development,
health threats, and emergency response. The chair of the council rotates
among the Arctic state members, with initiatives carried out by working
groups, task forces, and expert groups.

The Arctic Council has successfully navigated diplomatic disagreements
among member states, including the Iraq War in 2003, the Russo-Georgian
War in 2008, and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. On March 3,
2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the other seven
member states announced a pause in their participation. The pause
disrupted the council's 130 projects related to environmental
monitoring, data collection, equity, and search and rescue. It also put
the brakes on critical work and communication related to Indigenous
peoples, the environment, scientific research, and health safety.

Following discussions, in June 2022 those seven member states of the
council agreed to resume partial activity on existing projects not
involving the Russian Federation. In August 2023, all the Arctic Council
countries, including Russia, agreed to guidelines for resuming working
group and expert group activities. Further discussions with the six
permanent participant Indigenous peoples' organizations in October 2023
encouraged resumption of working group--level activities with Russia.
Then, in February 2024, Russia withheld its annual payment to the Arctic
Council. This step raises urgent questions about the council's future
without Russian participation. How can collaboration with Russia happen
when established diplomatic channels are diminished?

Understanding Russia's aspirations in the Arctic

A key to navigating future collaboration on emerging diseases and other
health risks in the Arctic is a deeper understanding of the future
Russia sees for itself as a leading power in the region. Russia controls
about 45% of the geographic territory of the Arctic, including the
Northern Sea Route---which is in Russia's exclusive economic zone---a
particularly useful seaway for moving cargo between the North Pacific
region and Northern Europe. Russia's position in the Arctic and its role
in current geopolitical crises contribute to broader debates on the
effectiveness of "soft law" (such as recommendations and codes of
conduct) and diplomacy in various areas of international scientific
cooperation, particularly for health and climate issues.

Already, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine
have shifted Russian foreign policy approaches to health and science
deeper into the security realm. [The invasion prompted many Western
countries to impose a range of scientific sanctions on Russia,
and]{.underline} though individual researchers are not banned from
cross-border collaboration, [travel between Russia and the West is more
complicated. The number of research collaborations between Russian
scientists and those from the United States and European countries has
fallen,]{.underline} as has the attendance of Russian researchers at
international academic conferences.

A year into the war with Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin
presented a new Foreign Policy Concept (FPC), an outline of Russia's
national interests, strategic goals, challenges, and main directions of
foreign policy, which had last been updated in 2016. The new FPC
emphasizes Arctic policy in commitments to "counteracting the unfriendly
states' policy aimed at militarization of the region" and "establishing
a mutually beneficial cooperation with the non-Arctic states pursuing a
constructive policy toward Russia." These statements signal Russia's
strategic interest in maintaining a formal presence on the Arctic
Council to preserve its political power in the Arctic while testing new
bilateral partnerships in the region.

Global health priorities in the FPC suggest Russia's continuing interest
in international discussions, but with variations in focus across
regions. The document links global health to environmental protection
and climate change, and goals include "increasing efficiency of
international cooperation in the area of health care and preventing its
politicization," as well as "consolidating international efforts in
order to prevent the extension of dangerous infectious diseases" and
quickly responding to crises, epidemics, and pandemics. Russia remains a
member of the World Health Organization (WHO) and is active in
convenings related to WHO's International Health Regulations and the
pandemic accord led by its Intergovernmental Negotiating Body.

It is significant, however, that neither of the FPC's agendas for health
or the Arctic refers to the existing international platforms---WHO and
the Arctic Council---for maintaining multilateral cooperation.

The lack of mention of multilateral platforms is notable alongside a
joint Russian-Chinese political statement in March 2023---timed closely
with the presentation of the Russian FPC---declaring the two countries'
intentions to act "in favor of preserving the Arctic as a territory of
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation." Though China has no
territorial claim in the Arctic, its plans for a Polar Silk Road via
Arctic waters to Europe, which is included in its Belt and Road
Initiative, indicate a vision for leadership in the region. Official
dialogue on the Arctic between Moscow and Beijing began in 2013. The
cooperation has produced two large Arctic energy infrastructure projects
and a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on maritime
law enforcement in the Arctic zone.

[Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}, coupled with China's ambitions for the region,
[could set back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health
security and cooperation networks]{.underline} among all Arctic states
and peoples. We think the situation calls for consideration of new
mechanisms for dialogue around emerging climate and health threats in
the region.

The entangled future of the Arctic, global health, and science diplomacy

As geopolitical and military instability abuts nonmilitary humanitarian
pursuits, Arctic states may be forced to allocate resources to
protecting individual interests over supporting scientific cooperation.
However, [in other periods of tension, science diplomacy has been key to
preserving cooperation between allies and rivals]{.underline}, as with
the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, the Edinburgh
Conversations, Cold War--era polio vaccine cooperation, and the
international effort to sequence SARS-CoV-2.

With the Arctic region in a precarious position, now may be the time to
move beyond traditional forms of diplomacy and center the pursuit of
alternative means of scientific cooperation around health and climate
security as a unifying purpose for continued engagement.

An important component of any effective international science
collaboration is the personal relationships cultivated between
scientists from around the world, often nurtured over decades. [To
preserve those relationships under an Arctic Council with diminished
capacity, we recommend Western policymakers and other stakeholders
**engage in bilateral initiatives** extending beyond the Arctic Council
framework]{.underline}.

**Science diplomacy is vital to addressing new pandemics**

and Security, Center for European Policy Analysis, Washington DC "Global
Diplomacy for the Arctic" Response to "Channels for Arctic Diplomacy",

The [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic powerfully [demonstrated the
importance of international scientific cooperation in addressing a
serious threat]{.underline} to human health and the existence of modern
society as we know it. [Diplomacy in]{.underline} the field of [science
witnessed a surge in the race to find a cure]{.underline} for the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. [The thawing Arctic region is at risk of giving rise
to a **new virus pandemic**]{.underline}, [and scientific collaboration
among democratic and authoritarian regimes]{.underline} in this vast
geographical area [should]{.underline} [always be made
possible]{.underline}.

International science collaboration and [science diplomacy]{.underline},
however altruistic, [risks being run over by the global big power
rivalry between]{.underline} players such as [Russia]{.underline},
China, [and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, with the
European Union and the BRIC countries acting as players in between. In
its recent report From Reluctance to Greater Alignment, the German
Marshall Fund argues that Russia's scientific interests in the Arctic,
beyond security considerations, are mostly economic with a focus on
hydrocarbon extraction and development of the Northern Sea Route,
trumping any environmental or health considerations.

Russian and Chinese scientific cooperation in the Arctic has increased
significantly since their first joint Arctic expedition in 2016. China
was Russia's top partner for research papers in 2023, and scientists
from both countries have downplayed the military implications of their
scientific collaborations in the Arctic, emphasizing their focus on
economic development. However, many aspects of this collaboration, such
as the Arctic Blue Economy Research Center, include military or dual-use
applications in space and deep-sea exploration, and have proven links to
the Chinese defense sector.

Given the scientific isolation of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine
in 2022, scientific collaboration in the areas of health and
environmental concerns within the auspices of the Arctic Council and
other international organizations seem to be the last benign avenues for
Russian scientific collaboration with other Arctic powers and the West
at large. Russia's pairing up with China on seabed and mineral
exploration in the Arctic does not, however, strengthen trust and
confidence of Russian efforts in health and environmental issues being
free of military and security policy.

[The last frontier of scientific cooperation for the benefit of health
and environmental stability in the Arctic region stands to be overrun by
global power politics, with science diplomacy being
weaponized]{.underline} as a security policy tool, among others. This is
a sad reality acknowledged by the seven countries---Canada, Denmark
(Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the United
States---that exercise sovereignty over the lands within the Arctic
Circle. (Russia was voted out of the oversight Arctic Council after its
invasion of Ukraine.) It is therefore worth considering whether
[Russia's Arctic research interest in the fields of health and
environment would benefit from a decoupling from China and any other
obvious military or dual-use application]{.underline}.

the [Putin]{.underline} administration [appears to remain committed to

its duties as chair of the Arctic Council to Norway]{.underline},[27
Russia amended its national Arctic Strategy and continued to affirm the
Arctic Council's leading role]{.underline} in overseeing international
activities in the region.28

Under Norway's leadership, a new approach is now cracking open a door
for dialogue on Arctic Council projects that include Russia.29 [All
Arctic states, in consultation with the permanent participants, have
agreed by consensus on new guidelines for decision-making via written
procedure]{.underline}, an approach that is permissible under the Arctic
Council's existing operating guidelines.30 Such a process is likely to
be more time-consuming and cumbersome than face-to-face communication.

In a media interview, the Norwegian Chair of the Senior Arctic

[The Arctic faces a climate emergency. The United States and Russia
should be working together to understand the deepening crisis---a global
security threat. Instead, essential cooperation is
fractured.]{.underline}

[Warming at a rate four times faster than the rest of the world, the
Arctic is disproportionately affected by global warming]{.underline}:
sea ice is diminishing, coastlines are eroding, ecosystems are
collapsing, and there are existential risks to local communities and
Indigenous livelihoods. [The Arctic climate crisis is the "canary in the
coal mine" for what awaits other regions.]{.underline} The transforming
Arctic has direct consequences on warming and rising sea levels around
the world.

Meanwhile[, [scientific cooperation to understand these processes has
been blunted since]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir Putin's decision to
send troops into [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2022. Following the
escalation of violence, [[joint projects, information sharing and expert
working groups between Russian and Western researchers and institutes
were severed]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[Arctic cooperation has a nearly century-long history of successful
initiatives based on mutual interest despite political
differences]{.underline} between states. [[The sharing of data,
international polar expeditions, and collaborative research are critical
for **constructing climate models**]{.mark} and prognoses [as well as
**informing effective adaptation** and **mitigation**
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Arctic Council Pause

Now, [this crucial research is jeopardized as international
collaboration with Russia has been abandoned or terminated]{.underline}.
In 2022, the Western Arctic states condemned Russia's military actions
in Ukraine and paused the work of the Arctic Council. [The White
House]{.underline} also [announced a termination of scientific
cooperation with Russia.]{.underline}

Russia had been the chair of the Council (2021--23) when the pause was
announced. Russian Arctic officials called the pause "regrettable" and
stressed the legacy of depoliticized dialogue.

Since its founding in 1996, the Arctic Council has been an exemplar of
constructive post--Cold War diplomacy. Nominated for the Nobel Prize
countless times, the Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum for
the eight Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
Russia, Sweden, and the US), Indigenous peoples' representatives, non-
governmental and international organizations, non-Arctic states, and
experts to cooperate in understanding Arctic climate change, sustainable
development, and environmental protection.

Since 2022, international scientists have lamented the dismal state of
Arctic scientific cooperation. [[Russia comprises 53 percent of the
Arctic coastline]{.mark} and over half of the Arctic human and wildlife
population; excluding the Russian Arctic limits our collective knowledge
on thawing permafrost, wildfires, polar bears and transforming
ecosystems]{.underline}.

One geophysicist from the University of Alaska said that [studying
permafrost without Russian data is "like **removing a couple of wheels
from a car and trying to drive it home**]{.underline}." A 2024 research
article found that [the current [exclusion of Russia from coordinated
Arctic research has significantly deteriorated scientists' ability
to]{.mark} track and further [predict the risks exposed by climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The Indigenous peoples of the North]{.underline}, who have lived in the
Arctic for millennia, [likewise bemoan the gaps in scientific data and
the welfare of their circumpolar families. Indigenous peoples were not
consulted by the Arctic states prior to the pause]{.underline}.
Previously, the Arctic Council was regarded as the only platform where
Indigenous peoples have inclusion in decision-making at the global
level.

Archiving [and [disseminating knowledge on global warming is imperative

[mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} of its multifaceted impacts. The
meticulous [collection and preservation of climate data ensure that
temporal trends and anomalies are accurately documented, facilitating

and fostering global cooperation]{.underline}. [In the context of Arctic
protection, the significance of these practices is
magnified]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Arctic region, a sentinel of climate
change, is experiencing unprecedented warming rates, leading to profound
ecological disruptions. [Archiving precise data on Arctic ice melt,
permafrost thaw, and associated biogeochemical feedbacks is vital for
predictive modeling and developing adaptive strategies]{.underline}
\[24\]. [Disseminating this knowledge enhances global awareness of the

weather patterns, and biodiversity]{.underline}. Thus, the rigorous
archiving and wide dissemination of knowledge on global warming are
essential pillars in the concerted effort to safeguard the Arctic and,
by extension, the planet's climatic equilibrium.

The primary goals of this chapter are to elucidate the vital importance
of archiving and disseminating knowledge on global warming and to
underscore its specific relevance to Arctic protection. By establishing
a comprehensive understanding of these processes, the chapter aims to
highlight how meticulous data collection and open access to information
are essential for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation
strategies. [[Accurate]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation
[dissemination]{.mark}]{.underline} plays a critical role in this

Although the Trump snub of the COP climate conferences is generally seen
as a setback, [[stronger climate action may now be possible **without

measures]{.underline}. And [[thousands of climate lawsuits]{.mark}
against U.S. governments and corporations [are
underway]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Trump's actions may also spur the migration of the U.S. renewables
industry to Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}. Regardless, renewables will
continue to replace fossil fuels worldwide.

[[A global movement of governments]{.mark},]{.underline} elected
officials, organizations and individuals has [endorsed the
Canadian-founded Fossil Fuels Non-Proliferation treaty
initiative]{.underline}. Modelled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, [it [sets clear deadlines for the global phaseout of fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

At the 2025 World Economic Forum, Fortescue, a global metal mining
giant, endorsed the treaty, the first major industrial company to do so.

In his famous 2015 Lloyd's of London speech, Carney, now the Liberal
leadership frontrunner, called climate change "the tragedy of the
horizon."

He warned that climate change will lead to financial crises and falling
living standards unless the world's biggest economies do more to ensure
their companies come clean about their current and future carbon
emissions.

Payam Akhavan, an Iranian-born Canadian human rights lawyer, served as
legal counsel to the Commission of Small Island States at the recent
International Court of Justice climate hearings where these nations
presented evidence about the devastating impact of climate change on
their citizens.

In an interview with CBC Ideas, Akhavan said: "What's happening to the
small island states today is going to happen to all of us tomorrow."

Ultimately, the writing is on the wall for fossil fuels. It's not a
matter of if the world moves away from them dramatically, but when.

### Trump kills Arctic science

#### Trump cuts are eviscerating Arctic science and will eliminate [decades]{.underline} of research

Mia **Bennett,** 20**25** - is an associate professor in the University
of Washington\'s Department of Geography. She researches the politics of
infrastructure development in the Arctic by combining fieldwork and

//DH

[[For decades, American scientists have been collecting observations
about the Arctic.]{.underline}]{.mark} [They have trained their
satellites on its ice cap, launched icebreaker expeditions into the
polar seas, dropped their probes in the rivers atop the Greenland Ice
Sheet]{.underline}, and waded through mosquito-infested swamps to
retrieve their sensors. Their efforts produced all sorts of data, from
monthly records of sea ice thickness to stunning, high-resolution maps
of nearly every square meter of the Arctic.

A great deal of this work has been funded by American taxpayers. In 2024
alone, [the budget for the US National Science Foundation]{.underline}
(NSF)'s [Office of Polar Programs]{.underline}, which supports Arctic
and Antarctic research, [was over half a billion]{.underline} dollars.
[[Thanks to being **publicly funded**,]{.mark} much of the [data
produced by American scientists has been made **freely available to the
entire world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Websites like the NSF's Arctic Data
Center showcase the diversity of data produced thanks to its grants,
from river water chemistry samples collected from the Arctic's six
"great rivers" to simulations of how small mammals affect vegetation
cover in Alaska.

Now, [devastating [cuts by]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[threaten]{.mark} [not
only]{.mark} future [Arctic research]{.mark} projects, [but]{.mark} the
maintenance of [data that has already been collected]{.mark} -- much of
it [for decades]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the president might boast
that his cuts will save Americans "trillions of dollars" over the next
decade, what is happening is akin to burning down a house that has taken
decades of painstaking work to build.

Trump administration deals sudden blows to US polar science

Earlier this week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
([NOAA]{.underline}), which is responsible for producing everything from
daily sea ice forecasts to the annual Arctic Report Card, [announced
that it would decommission its snow and ice data products. These include
its world-class sea ice index, snow data products, glacier photographs,
world glacier inventory, Arctic sea ice charts, and grids of monthly sea
ice extent and concentration from 1850 onward]{.underline}. Basically,
nearly any map made in the US including ice and snow in the past several
decades has likely included some of this data. Now that it is being
decommissioned, it will "remain accessible but may not be actively
maintained, updated, or fully supported."

NOAA's worrying announcement followed on the heels of another big blow
to to US polar science. In late April, the Polar Geospatial Center,
based at the University of Minnesota, published its annual release of
digital elevation models, or representations of the Earth's terrain, for
the Arctic and Antarctica (the ArcticDEM and Reference Elevation Model
of Antarctica products, respectively). The publication of this data came
with the caveat that it "may be the last of its kind...for the
foreseeable future." As the Polar Geospatial Center discloses, funding
constraints mean that they will no longer be able to produce these
high-resolution data products. Their announcement underscored, "This
marks the end of a transformative era for polar science and a critical
moment to reflect, respond, and rally support."

In fact, it has now become clear that funding for the Polar Geospatial
Center, which came from the NSF, will not be renewed. As British climate
scientist Ruth Mottram put it on Bluesky, "This is naked vandalism."
Many people, including me, have been trained at the Polar Geospatial
Center over the years. Back in 2015, I participated in a free summer
school for graduate students to learn about how to use and analyze polar
geospatial data. Without their support and products, I would be much
worse off when it comes to making maps of the Arctic.

The near-term outlook for US polar science looks even worse

At the moment, [[the scenario for the US polar research community next
year looks even worse. Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} and his lackeys [[are
taking a sledgehammer to]{.mark} all things science and climate, putting
the work of people like [glaciologists, polar oceanographers, and
Indigenous experts]{.mark} directly in the administration's
crosshairs]{.underline}. An indignant letter from Russell Vought,
director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, to
Senator Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations,
argued that a review of the 2025 federal budget revealed it to be "laden
with spending contrary to the needs of ordinary working Americans and
tilted toward funding niche non-governmental organizations and
institutions of higher education committed to radical gender and climate
ideologies antithetical to the American way of life."

## Arctic Council scenario

### Arctic Council collapse now

#### Fragmentation of the Arctic Council is increasing due to the exclusion of Russia -- non-Arctic states are aligning with Russia now

Accommodate Global Geopolitical Changes?" Russia in Global Affairs,

//DH

However, [in 2022, the Arctic powers could no longer stand together, and
the bloc solidarity of Western countries began to outweigh their purely
Arctic interests. The Arctic club collapsed, seeming to create favorable
conditions for extra-regional countries interested in enlarging their
role in the Arctic.]{.underline}

Yet there is no sign of their increased activity in the region's
institutions, as [those institutions' legitimacy and usefulness have
collapsed due to Russia's exclusion.]{.underline} For example, in the
fall of 2022, amidst discussions of unilaterally transferring
chairmanship of the Arctic Council to Norway, China warned it would not
recognize the institution if Russia were excluded from it (The High
North News, 2022).

Moreover, [the East and South, increasingly dissatisfied with the West's
liberal world order]{.underline}, which does not permit them to realize
their development goals, [are themselves becoming increasingly
revisionist and thus aligned with Russia.]{.underline}

[Global dynamics are drawing leading BRICS members---Russia, India, and
China---together, making them natural partners in the
Arctic.]{.underline} These countries seek to strengthen their positions
in the region and have a similar vision of global processes. The events
of the last few years and the countries' current plans with regard to
the Arctic confirm this assumption. Specifically, BRICS countries are
planning to open a joint scientific center in Svalbard (Interfax, 2024);
Russia and China are strengthening cooperation in sea management (RIA
Novosti, 2023); Russia and India are strengthening cooperation on the
Northern Sea Route (Korabel, 2023; Arguments and Facts, 2023). Russia's
2023 Foreign Policy Concept calls for cooperation in the Arctic with
friendly extra-regional countries. Nevertheless, China and India are not
motivated by an anti-Western ideology and remain open to cooperation
with the West when it is in their national interests. Both China and
India remain present at major Western expert conferences on the Arctic,
such as the Arctic Circle Forums (Pedersen and Steinveg, 2024); in 2023,
India and the U.S. held joint military exercises in Alaska (Bye, 2023).

Thus, [amid the Ukraine crisis, the leading countries of the East and
the South eschew participation in Russia-excluding Arctic institutions,
and are increasing their own cooperation with Russia in the
region]{.underline}, while also maintaining cooperation with the West.

\* \* \*

The ongoing transformation of the world order is irreversible:
international institutions will change or collapse, but the role and
importance of the countries of the East and the South will grow. The
last few years have shown that the Arctic is no exception to the general
rule as it is also subject to turbulent changes in the system of
international relations.

[The Arctic system that existed before 2022 is gone
forever]{.underline}. If any institutions continue to function with
Russia's participation, they will presumably change by reducing the
rigidness of institutionalization and narrowing the agenda.

Certain changes have already occurred even in the treaty-based Arctic
regimes.

[The atmosphere of cooperation has been damaged]{.underline} at the
International Maritime Organization, which devised the Polar Code
(Koivurova and Shibata, 2023). [Political bias, such as boycotting or
avoiding engagement with Russian representatives, has forced Russia to
withdraw from the International Council for the Exploration of the
Sea,]{.underline} which recommends quotas for fishing in the North
Atlantic (The Fishing Daily, 2024). The Agreement on the Conservation of
Polar Bears continues to operate, and its members even hold video
consultations, but some of its work has been curtailed; for example,
data on human-bear conflict is no longer exchanged. [While the Agreement
on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation formally
survives, cooperation between Russian and other Arctic states'
scientists has largely ended]{.underline} (Rees and Büntgen, 2024).

[These trends are likely to continue under]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} Administration, especially given its
climate/environmental policy. During his first term, in 2019, [Trump
refused to sign the Arctic Council's declaration]{.underline}, since it
mentioned the Paris Agreement, and Mike Pompeo harshly criticized China
and Russia at the Council's ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi (Arctic
Council, 2019). [International cooperation is likely to become **even
more fragmented now**]{.underline}, especially [given the new U.S.
administration's position on environmental and climate
issues.]{.underline}

As for Trump's latest statements regarding the incorporation of Canada
and Greenland, U.S. Arctic policy is currently transforming more in
terms of rhetoric than practical implementation, and this rhetoric is
unlikely to be followed by real action. Robert Keohane (2005) writes:
"It is difficult for a hegemon to use military power directly to attain
its economic policy objectives with its military partners and allies.
Allies cannot be threatened with force without beginning to question the
alliance." Robert Gilpin notes that it is important for a hegemon not to
weaken but to strengthen its allies who make the entire alliance
stronger: "With the outbreak of the Cold War, the United States
undertook a number of important initiatives to strengthen the war-torn
economies of its allies, to forge a powerful anti-Soviet alliance, and
subsequently, to fasten these allied economies firmly to the United
States" (Gilpin, 2001).

The role of the East and the South in the Arctic will likely continue to
increase, as it has since before 2022, partly facilitated by the Arctic
club's disintegration. To a certain extent, in the Arctic, Russia
benefitted from the previous world order, which endowed it with special
status as an Arctic power.

For example, Nima Khorrami (2024) maintains that "instead of aligning
with Russia, India should consider forging an approach with other
like-minded non-regional states such as Japan and South Korea ... The
trio should then advocate within the Arctic Council for enhanced
observer participation to rectify current disparities and promote a more
inclusive and equitable Council, fostering a balanced Arctic
perspective. To this end, the underlying goal must be ... to convince
the Nordic states, as well as the United States and Canada, to more
rapidly open up their Arctic regions to commercial activities thereby
providing a real alternative to Russia's Arctic." But [Russia may also
have the chance to reorganize the region to better reflect Russia's
interests and regional importance, including through cooperation with
other non-Arctic countries.]{.underline}

[While Russia should not reject cooperation with the Western powers of
the Arctic]{.underline}---whether on climate change, environmental
pollution, or destructive fishing practices---[the ball is in their
court.]{.underline}

#### Excluding Russia from scientific cooperation destroys the Arctic Council

Barry Scott **Zellen**, 20**24** - Research Scholar, Department of
Geography, University of Connecticut. "As Ongoing War in Ukraine
Precipitates a Crisis in Circumpolar Unity, a Full Restoration of the
Arctic Council Is Needed -- Now More Than Ever" Yearbook of Polar Law
XV, 172-212, Brill database, accessed via Brown University //DH

[The Arctic Council is a unique organization, with legitimacy that
extends across the entirety of the circumpolar worl]{.underline}d, from
the western tip of the Aleutian Islands all the way to the eastern tip
of Siberia spanning a diverse mosaic of states, tribal peoples, remote
environments, and fragile ecosystems undergoing an historic climatic
transition. [The Council brings together the eight founding Arctic
states]{.underline}, of which Russia is the most vast (spanning eleven
time zones) with states as small as Iceland[, and includes within its
innovative governance structure the six aforementioned Indigenous
Peoples' organizations]{.underline}, the Permanent Participants,
[providing them with much influence and a voice at the
table,]{.underline} with a diverse range of Observers, both state and
non-state, allowing countries as far away as Singapore and as
consequential to the world economy as China, an opportunity to
participate, regardless of their domestic governing structures or
ideologies and in the case of China, in spite of its track record of
oppression of minority peoples (such as Xinjiang) or the lingering
legacies invasions past (Tibet) even if a cause of symbolic diplomatic
boycotts such as the absence of top officials at the Beijing Olympics.

Moreover, [the issues facing the Arctic, of which climate change is
perhaps the most pressing for all stakeholders, small and large, cannot
be paused]{.underline}. Nor should they. And [[**excluding Russia from
any discussions**, with the Russian Arctic representing]{.mark} some
[half the Arctic]{.mark}'s geographical extent, [would render the
Council's efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, which for over 25 years have
demonstrated their efficacy around the circumpolar world,
[[substantially reduced.]{.mark} There are no half-way solutions to the
future of the Arctic]{.underline}, whether it's peacetime or wartime.
But [after more than a quarter century of Arctic cooperation, [this is
the first time this unique intergovernmental forum, which has long been
a **model for the world to emulate**, has been
suspended]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even during the peak of the Covid-19
pandemic, the Council managed to meet virtually, finding like so many
others that vast distances could be overcome through digital
connections. Somehow the Arctic felt less vast, less isolated, at a
moment when it was more cut off from the rest of the world than it had
been for generations.

And while Russia's actions in Ukraine are reprehensible, putting at risk
the post-Cold War order of which the 1996 formation of the Arctic
Council was an exemplary and illustrative moment, [suspending the
Council's operations]{.underline} because Russia then held its rotating
chair, [seemed as illogical as shuttering the UN General
Assembly]{.underline} -- or putting a pause on meetings of the Security
Council. [[Intergovernmental bodies are one space in world politics
where rivals and opponents can meet face to face, even in times of
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Their business does not stop when hostilities
commence; oftentimes, their responsibilities multiply manifold at such
times as now. [The world needs the full Arctic Council no less today
than it did before]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark} invasion]{.underline},
[[perhaps even more now that its unity to stand together to overcome the
challenges of climate change has collapsed]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
author Ed Struzik explained in an email interview, the resulting
**["[cessation of scientific collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[comes at a precarious moment for the Arctic: Environmental risks
associated with sea ice loss, pollution, and shipping are
increasing]{.mark}; [Russia and other Arctic states are proposing new
boundary lines along the continental shelf that would expand their
claims over the Arctic Ocean seabed]{.mark}]{.underline}[; [and
peatlands have been continuing to burn]{.underline}]{.mark} after a year
of record-setting wildfires [[in northern Russia]{.underline}]{.mark},
adding substantially to the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. (Russia
is the world's fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases.) In addition,
China is ramping up its economic interests in the Arctic."6 Despite the
urgency of the challenges confronting the Arctic, Struzik observes,
"based on everything I've seen and heard from scientists so far,
pan-Arctic cooperation is unlikely so long as Putin is in power."7

[This is a dramatic setback to the globalist vision of pan-Arctic
cooperation]{.underline} put forth in 1996 in the Ottawa Declaration,
which established the Arctic Council, building upon the foundation of
the 1991 Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS). Formally
titled the Declaration on the Establishment of the Arctic Council, it
was promulgated by the eight Arctic states -- Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden and the United States of
America -- in 1996, in which they affirmed their "commitment to the
well-being of the inhabitants of the Arctic, including recognition of
the special relationship and unique contributions to the Arctic of
Indigenous People and their communities;" the "sustainable development
in the Arctic region, including economic and social development,
improved health conditions and cultural wellbeing;" and the "protection
of the Arctic environment, including the health of Arctic ecosystems,
maintenance or biodiversity in the Arctic region and conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources;" while recognizing "the
contributions of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy to these
commitments;" "the traditional knowledge of the Indigenous People of the
Arctic and their communities and taking note of its importance and that
of Arctic science and research to the collective understanding of the
circumpolar Arctic;" and "the valuable contribution and support of the
Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Saami Council, and the Association of the
Indigenous Minorities of the North, Siberia, and the Far East of the
Russian Federation in the development of the Arctic Council."8

Expanding upon the edifice provided by the 1991 AEPS, the Arctic states
expressed their mutual desire "to provide a means for promoting
cooperative activities to address Arctic issues requiring circumpolar
cooperation, and to ensure full consultation with and the full
involvement of Indigenous Peoples and their communities and other
inhabitants of the Arctic in such activities;" and "to provide for
regular intergovernmental consideration of and consultation on Arctic
issues."9 They thereby declared the establishment of the Council as a
"high level forum to: provide a means for promoting cooperation,
coordination and interaction among the Arctic States, with the
involvement of the Arctic Indigenous communities and other Arctic
inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular issues of sustainable
development and environmental protection in the Arctic; oversee and
coordinate the programs established under the AEPS on the Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP); Conservation of Arctic Flora
and Fauna (CAFF); Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME);
and Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response (EPPR); adopt terms
of reference for, and oversee and coordinate a sustainable development
program; \[and\] disseminate information, encourage education and
promote interest in Arctic related issues."10

In addition to the member states being the A8, it also designated in
paragraph 2 that the "Inuit Circumpolar Conference, the Saami Council
and the Association of Indigenous Minorities of the North, Siberia and
the Far East of the Russian Federation are Permanent Participants in the
Arctic Council" and that "\[p\]ermanent participation equally is open to
other Arctic organizations of Indigenous Peoples with majority Arctic
Indigenous constituency, representing: a single Indigenous Peoples
resident in more than one Arctic State; or more than one Arctic
Indigenous Peoples resident in a single Arctic state."11 This inclusive
definition made possible the variation in ethnic composition of the
Permanent Participant groups as well as the variation in scale, from
representing as few as several thousand constituents like the AIA and
GCI from a single tribal group to over a quarter million constituents
from over forty tribal groups like RAIPON, with Permanent Participants
ranging in order of magnitude from four digits to six. Once the council
determines "that such an organization has met this criterion," the
Ottawa Declaration capped the total number of Permanent Participant
groups to "at any time be less than the number of members," and since
the Arctic states number eight, there can be no more than seven
Permanent Participants, one more than the present six.12 Permanent
Participants lack the agency of member states to implement Arctic
policies, which remain the prerogative of states, many Permanent
Participants or components thereof have achieved formal governing powers
within their home states owing to an impressive variety of institutional
powers, whether constitutional, legislative, or co-managerial. Indeed,
at the local and regional levels, their powers often are represented by
a local or regional level of governance or greatly overlap therewith.
This further fulfils the aspiration of the Ottawa Declaration that the
"category of Permanent Participation is created to provide for active
participation and full consultation with the Arctic Indigenous
representatives within the Arctic Council."13 In addition to the Arctic
states and the Permanent Participants, the Ottawa Declaration also
recognized three categories of observers that include "non-Arctic
states; inter-governmental and inter-parliamentary organizations, global
and regional; and non-governmental organizations that the Council
determines can contribute to its work."14

Arctic Council members have long found unity in their diversity, and
approached their Arctic borders with a collaborative spirit seldom found
along borders further south. The challenge, of course, is in minimizing
tensions across Arctic borders, at a time when one of the Arctic states
is at war with a neighbor (Ukraine) this is, in response, on
increasingly friendly (and strategically integrated) terms with the
other Arctic states and the NATO alliance to which they are all now (or
expected soon to be) members of. This is no easy feat; but it's not the
first time there's been strategic dissension at the top of the world;
indeed, with six of the eight Arctic Council members now part

of the NATO alliance (and the seventh awaiting final membership
ratification), there can hardly be a day without strategic dissension in
the Arctic even at the best of times. And yet, [the Arctic has been one
of the most stable regions of the world, despite the preexisting
condition of strategic competition]{.underline}, whether along an
east-west divide, tribe-state divide, or the various divides that have
emerged over the years such as between the A5, whose coasts directly
abut the Arctic basin (Russia, Norway, Denmark/Greenland, Canada and the
United States), and the A3 (Iceland, Finland, and Sweden) whose coasts
abut either the Baltic or the Atlantic basins.

Indeed, [there was a time not very long ago when the Arctic Council
confronted a deep division in its ranks that threatened the very
consensus]{.underline} that serves as the bedrock of its successful
first quarter century. That member challenged the accepted consensus by
all the Council's other stakeholders (member states, Permanent
Participants, and observers alike). After two impressive decades of
sustained consensus in good times and bad, that member state broke ranks
with that unanimity -- and in so doing, made it impossible for a joint
declaration to emerge from a ministerial meeting for the very first
time. (But even then, every effort was made to restore unity and to
ensure continued cooperation at the Council among all members,
illustrating the endurance of globalism at the Council even then.) That
time was just a few years ago: [in 2019]{.underline}. The founding
member state was not Russia, but the United States, now perceived by its
A7 colleagues as the savior of not only Europe, but a free Arctic as
well. [The issue that then drove a wedge between the US and its fellow
Arctic Council members]{.underline} and other stakeholders [was a change
in policy on climate change]{.underline}, long a unifying issue for all
Arctic Council stakeholders and the most pressing and salient issue
before the Council, and many believe, confronting humanity. [Despite
this collapse in consensus, the Council]{.underline} -- built on and
committed to consensus among its membership, with its meaningful and
enduring bridges of communication and collaboration between a diverse
array of Arctic stakeholders, from the village to the national to the
tribal to the transnational level -- [survived, and only a few short
years later, consensus was fully restored]{.underline}. The organization
proved as resilient as the diverse collective of Arctic peoples, states,
cultures, and organizations it represents.

Over a decade earlier, that same Arctic Council outlier, the United
States, went to war half a world away from the Arctic (fueled by its own
tribalist response to the strategic shock of 9/11), bringing along a
coalition of partners in its quest to rid Iraq of a fictitious WMD
program and to depose its autocratic leader, perpetrating a
heartbreaking series of war crimes along the way, and sinking the Middle
East region into chaos that would last a generation and which would see
a stable, autocratic Iraq collapse into a failed state and become a
breeding ground of terror, ultimately providing Al Qaeda with an
opportunity it had not found before, and yielding the emergence of the
Islamic State caliphate, which required a brutal air war to dismantle.
Across Iraq and Syria, a generation has endured unprecedented bloodshed
and destruction, all a direct result of America's own wars of choice
built on a foundation of lies. And yet, at the top of the world,
however, the Arctic remained united and cooperative, and the US and
Russia each contributed their part to the enduring Arctic peace, even as
their proxies battled violently across the Middle East. America's wars
may have been framed as wars of self-defense, much the way Moscow now
frames its current war, and wars to pre-empt WMD programs (much as
Moscow now echoes, seizing control of nuclear plants while cautioning
against seemingly fictitious Ukrainian chemical weapons programs). It's
as if we've seen this story before. But because it's Moscow on the
offensive, and not the United States, the world is reacting differently
this time to a similarly tragic and disingenuous masquerade.

With Russia bloodied but still on a war path -- a path Russian
Federation president Vladimir Putin often describes as a "noble cause"
-- having launched what much of the rest of the world sees as an
undeniable, unjustifiable unprovoked war of aggression that once again
challenges the consensus that for so long united the Arctic world, [[we
are]{.mark} [back to]{.mark} this very same precipice of [a collapsing
Arctic consensus]{.mark}]{.underline} [like we saw j]{.underline}ust a
few years earlier, [when America unilaterally quit the global coalition
against climate change]{.underline}. The brutal conflict still unfolding
is different in nearly every way from that previous disagreement at
Arctic Council's Rovaniemi ministerial in 2019, but [the stakes
are]{.underline} perhaps [comparable]{.underline}, if imperfectly so --
**[[with the future of humanity once again at
stake]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and consensus on unifying values once
again eluding a single yet essential member of the circumpolar family.
And while this comparison will not be greeted with equal receptiveness
amidst the current crisis unfolding across Ukraine at the hand of
Russian aggression, [[the moral scale of]{.mark} [both global
challenges, and their **mutual risk to humanity**, have an equivalency
of scale and risk]{.mark}]{.underline} even if not the same palpable
sense of immediacy.

[If the Arctic Council can survive the collapse of its climate change
consensus]{.underline} (as it did in 2019) that was forged at its
distinctly inclusive and consensual table during its first quarter
century, [there is no reason it can't do the same again on this latest
challenge to its unity and cohesion]{.underline}. Indeed, [it must do
so, and -- particularly as Russia is the largest of the Arctic states,
with the largest Arctic population, with the largest Arctic economy and
the most diverse and populous mosaic of minority cultures]{.underline}.
Russia, while just one of eight member states, represents fully half the
circumpolar world by most measures. While it took the collapse of the
Soviet Union to allow for the close collaboration that the Arctic
Council nurtured, with its new model of inclusive diplomacy bridging the
state-tribe interface, the foundations of the Arctic Council took root
well before the Cold War ended, and its founding vision was articulated
eloquently by the last Soviet premier in his famed Murmansk speech in
1987. The boundary line separating the USA from the USSR (and now
Russia), which was negotiated by the last Soviet foreign minister with
his American counterpart, has been respected by both post-Cold War USA
and Russia since 1990, laying a stable foundation on what could
otherwise be a volatile border. The current shipping lane through the
Bering Strait was jointly negotiated by the USA and Russia, reflecting
the ongoing stability on this Arctic frontier, with the U.S. Coast Guard
and the Russian Border Service developing a laudable bilateral
relationship that contrasts with so many of Russia's other borders.
[This says something about the fundamental importance of Arctic
collaboration to **world order**]{.underline}, regardless of which party
or individual sits atop either country's government.

#### Arctic Council is useless without Russian participation

There was every reason to isolate Russia as the war in Ukraine
continued, to maintain sanctions, and to remind Putin that he had become
a pariah that threatens global stability. But [no matter how things
unfold in Europe, Russia still remains half of the circumpolar
world]{.underline}. [Governing the Arctic effectively, and peacefully,
still requires Russia's participation and consent]{.underline}. [The
Arctic climate will continue its inexorable thaw]{.underline}; its still
pristine ecosystems remain as fragile and sublime now as they did before
Russia invaded Ukraine. Arctic Indigenous Peoples continue to offer the
world their wisdom and traditional knowledge, and require our continued,
good-faith efforts to overcome past economic marginalization and
political exclusion.

[By keeping the]{.underline} now more than year-long [pause on Arctic
Council participation as brief as possible, and resuming meetings among
its stakeholders]{.underline} virtually and in symbolic protest [while
trying to restore consensus with Russia]{.underline} [on
the]{.underline} many important [issues that still unite the whole of
the circumpolar world, the Arctic Council can still become part of
the]{.underline} answer to, and [resolution of, the current conflict. It
can offer the very same bridge to a collaborative future]{.underline}
that it has promised since 1996 and show that its second quarter century
can be as successful as its first, with a common embrace of globalist
values. [The Arctic Council survived the collapse of consensus once
before,]{.underline} on an issue of great import, that of the climate
change challenge facing humanity and requiring our collective unity to
overcome[. The Council]{.underline} can -- and [must -- survive the
current collapse in consensus that has accompanied the conflict over
Ukraine, and keep this important bridge to a more peaceful, united and
globalized future open for the time when Moscow is ready to reset its
policies, and rejoin the consensus the whole Arctic Council has for so
long embraced.]{.underline}

### AT: Status quo Arctic Council solves

#### Current Arctic Council cooperation is too small scale -- Russia's participation is limited

The crisis in Arctic scientific cooperation since the war signals the
critical role of science diplomacy for both the regional governance and
climate policy. Although often regarded as a soft power instrument, it
has now assumed a hard power dimension by isolating a state that
controls nearly half of the polar territory from transnational Arctic
research. Nevertheless, [science diplomacy may prove instrumental in
restarting scientific collaboration in the Arctic]{.underline}, should
it resume at full capacity (Devyatkin, 2022). [In August 2023, the
Arctic Council]{.underline} reached an agreement to resume cooperation.
In February 2024, it [came to a consensus to gradually reintegrate
Russia into the working groups through virtual meeting
formats]{.underline} (Arctic Council, 2024). [While this announcement
may signal a positive direction in the restoration of scientific
cooperation, the deepening political, economic, and military divide
between the West and Russia makes a return to pre-war levels of
cooperation increasingly unlikely]{.underline} (Spence et al., 2024).
Russia's withdrawal from the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program
in the Russian Federation (MNEPR), established in 2003, in the area of
spent fuel safety and radioactive waste management signals a systematic
disengagement from Western partners (Interfax, 2024).

### Arctic war impact

#### Low US-Russian nuclear relations in the Arctic risk nuclear war

[Arctic security can be characterised as a nexus between multipolar
nuclear conflict and climate change]{.underline}. Multipolarity is
defined as a global balance of power between multiple actors \[3\].
Climate Change is making seaways and resources more accessible, which is
leading to a thawing of territorial conflicts which were formerly frozen
\[4\]. China's increasing economic interests in the Arctic means it must
be considered as a regional actor despite its near-regional status
\[5\]. Russia has recently threatened to use nuclear weapons against the
United States (U.S.) due to its objections to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine; this sets a precedent for heightened nuclear tension in [the
Arctic]{.underline}, which [is the most nuclearized area in the world
and has seen a steady buildup of nuclear and conventional forces by
regional actors]{.underline} \[6\]. These factors have led to direct
tensions between three major nuclear actors (namely, NATO, China, and
Russia) in a region that is becoming increasingly competitive \[7\].
These [tensions cannot be adequately explained by existing deterrence
models]{.underline}, which rely on Cold War-era bipolar game theory
\[8\]. Due to climate change, geopolitical tension, and the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, [nuclear relations in the Arctic are unstable and
present serious security risks]{.underline} that cannot be contended
with through the use of classic deterrence theory \[9\].

Arctic Governance and Climate Change

The Arctic region is 66.5° north of the equator and encompasses the
United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and
Iceland, all of whom are members of the region's governing body, the
Arctic Council \[10\]. The region's international legal status currently
lies under the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea,
however, due to climate change, polar ice is melting, making the region
more accessible by sea and opening up its vast oil and gas deposits for
extraction by regional actors \[11\].

Sino-Russian cooperation along sea routes has given China significant
influence in the region, which it wants to develop into a "Polar Silk
Road" as outlined in its 2018 Arctic White Paper \[12\]. Chinese
development interests do not align with Russia's geopolitical goals in
the Arctic, and China's ownership over Arctic infrastructure represents
an economic threat to Russian interests \[13\]. There is growing
competition between these regional actors which is exacerbated by
overlapping territorial boundary claims by Denmark, Canada, and Russia.
In addition, the Arctic Council has suspended cooperation due to its
chairmanship by Russia until the end of 2023 \[14\].

Deterrence and Arctic Nuclear Relations

Classic nuclear deterrence is steeped in Cold War bipolarity and relies
on two rational actors basing their decisions on what they believe their
opponents\' actions will be \[15\]. Classic deterrence is expressed
through the Chicken Game \[16\]. As seen in the figure below, a player's
options are to defect and pursue a foreign policy objective or to
cooperate and maintain the status quo \[17\]. The best outcome for an
actor is to defect against a cooperating partner; however, this runs the
risk of both players defecting, leading to nuclear annihilation \[18\].

This classic deterrence game does not contend with the possibility of
conflict between multiple nuclear actors, which is a key feature of
Arctic security \[19\]. Though a three-player chicken game has been
applied to theoretical problems, such as two out of three players
needing to complete a task that all would rather not complete, this
model has yet to be applied to nuclear relations \[20\]. China, NATO,
the U.S., and Russia's nuclear doctrines are informed by deterrence
theory, which is problematic due to the theory's assumption of a bipolar
world order \[21\].

[Nuclear multipolarity in the Arctic is unstable because it no longer
falls within]{.underline} the [traditional game theory]{.underline}
matrix, [and there is an increased risk of nuclear action due to a
larger number of nuclear actors and significant regional
tension]{.underline} \[22\]. [Preemptive nuclear strikes are more
prevalent in multipolar nuclear politics due to a greater perception of
threat from other actors]{.underline} \[23\]. Though China promotes
itself as a No First Use (NFU) state, meaning that it will not strike
unless struck upon in a nuclear capacity, [Russia has threatened to
strike first]{.underline}, and America's position on NFU is vague
\[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent organisation in the Arctic region,
only Sweden is not yet a full NATO member and Finland has just recently
gained NATO membership \[25\]. In multipolar deterrence, [regional
conflicts are more likely to escalate into **total nuclear
warfare**]{.underline}, [and de-escalation relies on political
bargaining as opposed to rationality modelling]{.underline}. Thus, [it
is unclear how political bargaining will take place in an increasingly
polarised Arctic]{.underline} \[26\].

Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), [both Russia
and the U.S. have backed out of data-sharing obligations under the New
START treaty]{.underline} \[27\]. [This breakdown in communication
between Arctic actors due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's
recent threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. indicates that
future regional disputes over Arctic resources, navigation, and
territory may give rise to nuclear crises]{.underline} \[28\].

#### Absent diplomacy, war could start through miscalculation

//DH

However, [Moscow]{.underline}'s military posture in the Arctic has not
changed in the context of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and it
r[emains bent on obsessive control over the AZRF and countering NATO
activity.]{.underline} Russia's vast multi-layered network of
Arctic-capable air and coastal defence systems has stayed in place along
the AZRF and has not been tremendously impacted by the war against
Ukraine.

In this context -- and judging by the sense of conventional
vulnerability fuelling Russia's Arctic insecurities -- [there is a risk
that Moscow could engage in more overt nuclear sabre-rattling and
escalatory behaviour]{.underline}. There remains an outside chance that
[Russia could resume nuclear weapons testing on the islands of Novaya
Zemlya]{.underline}. [This situation is compounded by the inherent risk
of miscalculation provoked by accidents, incidents and tactical errors,
left unchecked by the current absence of lines of
communication]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, the [**fragmentation of circumpolar cooperation** is
**closing doors on diplomatic activity** that could help to **diffuse
tensions** and promote confidence-building]{.underline} measures. Prior
to 2022, there was some discussion of re-establishing joint military
forums or some form of 'code of conduct', but this dissipated quickly as
Moscow's designs on Ukraine became clear. [The chances of a predictable
Arctic in military security terms are growing slimmer]{.underline}.

[The risk of an armed conflict in the Arctic is clearly higher than it
was]{.underline}. However, this does not mean that either NATO or Moscow
is any more likely to seek a conflict in the Arctic than they were prior
to Russia's assault on Ukraine. Considering the complexity of the
operating environment, there is little incentive for Moscow -- or NATO
-- to escalate in the Arctic per se, let alone conduct high-intensity
warfare operations there.

There is no sign yet (publicly at least) that either side is seeking to
change the 'facts on the ground' regarding critical international
agreements, or even press claims in areas of disagreement -- for
instance, over how to interpret the Svalbard Treaty on the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as it applies to the Northeast Passage
(including the Northern Sea Route, or NSR) and the delimitation of
extended continental shelves.

Nevertheless, [Russia remains determined to control 'its' Arctic and the
NSR]{.underline}. Over the past few years, successive waves of
regulations have increasingly restricted passage through the NSR,
placing it under Moscow's tight control. If, even as the effects of
climate change are felt, Russia maintains its dubious interpretation of
the status of the NSR, or if the Kremlin seeks to further restrict
passage along the route (especially for foreign military vessels[),
there could be more serious consideration of a US- or NATO-led Freedom
of Navigation operation, even if it increases the risk of an armed
clash]{.underline}.

These issues are all the more critical in the context of the renewed US
interest in Arctic affairs as part of the 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region (NSAR) and its 2023 Implementation Plan. Indeed, the NSAR
is quite clear regarding protecting freedom of navigation across the
Arctic region in accordance with UNCLOS.

For now, [the most likely scenario is that we will continue to see a
balancing and counterbalancing of NATO and Russian forces in the High
North]{.underline} as both sides adjust to the realities of Swedish and
Finnish membership of NATO. The danger is that [this could increase the
risk of a miscalculation provoked by an accident escalating into
something worse]{.underline}. [More presence and platforms in a changing
Arctic will undoubtedly bring about more incidents, including
environmental catastrophes and human-made disasters]{.underline}, with
indigenous peoples and other local communities bearing the brunt of the
impact.

#### Russian exclusion makes the Arctic an arena for great power conflict

//DH

The age of Arctic exceptionalism is gone: [the high north region is no
longer a protected sphere of Russia-West engagement and dialogue. The
decision]{.underline} in March [by Arctic Council states to suspend
cooperation with Moscow in the Arctic]{.underline} was immediately
welcomed but [might]{.underline} yet [prove]{.underline} to be rather
[shortsighted. Coupled with enduring capability gaps in]{.underline}
which [Washington]{.underline} has merely two icebreakers (old girls
prone to fires and breakdowns), with Russia's count in the vicinity of
forty, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has essentially
[put its Arctic interests in the crosshairs by suspending dialogue with
Russia.]{.underline}

[There is a price for isolating Moscow in the Arctic---where geography
legitimately assigns Russia more than half of the theater]{.underline}.
The ability to maintain control of Washington's own Arctic frontier is
complicated by a litany of second-order effects that stem from the
cessation of dialogue with Russia in the Arctic context. [Washington
should expect new Arctic players, namely China and India, in its polar
backyard]{.underline}. [The region is set to become a more crowded, and
contested, strategic theater]{.underline}.

Make no mistake, **[Russia is doubling down on ushering in new Arctic
stakeholders]{.underline}**. Western sanctions on Russian Arctic energy
ventures and Arctic shipping developments have allowed Chinese, Indian,
and Middle Eastern firms to pick up (at discounted rates) stakes in
ventures once belonging to the West, bolstering their geoeconomic
footholds in the Russian Arctic. Increased investment often leads to
enhanced military footprints by stakeholders keen to protect national
(economic) interests: just look to Chinese strategy in Africa. Beijing
repeating this strategy in the Russian Arctic is not all together
unlikely.

Recently, Chinese and Russian naval vessels were spied off the coast of
Alaska near the Bering Strait. China has its own Arctic designs, as
codified in its 2018 Arctic Policy. Further, Beijing has considerable
relevant capability: an indigenous icebreaker-building industry, two
state-of-the-art icebreakers, and a nuclear-powered icebreaker that will
soon enter service.

Chinese resource strategy for the Arctic is well documented. Yet recent
months have seen clear indications of a booming Russia-India Arctic
relationship. India has long signaled its intent to deepen ties with
Russia in the Arctic and recently also penned its first Arctic Policy.
Then there is the United Arab Emirates, keenly developing a specialized
fleet of ice-hardened container ships to take advantage of the Arctic's
Northern Sea Route (NSR). The NSR is set to one day reshape global
transportation, cutting transit times between Asia and Europe by up to
40 percent.

[Many states are actively working to capitalize on the breakdown in
Arctic cooperation between Russia and the Wes]{.underline}t. This is
evident in the international governance space---just look to the United
Nations Security Council (UNSC). Of the Arctic Council's thirteen
observer states, four are currently serving on the UNSC. China, a
permanent UNSC member and Arctic Council observer, abstained from the
resolution to denounce Russia, as did India (a nonpermanent member of
the UNSC and an Arctic Council observer).

It is in the strategic interest of the West to uphold the integrity of
certain Arctic agreements. This, though, requires engagement with
Russia. An example, given China's enhanced capabilities in irregular
warfare---particularly its maritime militia---is the ban on commercial
fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean. The initial period covered by the
ban extends until 2037, during which time Arctic states will need
Russian support if China is to be held accountable for any violations.
It is a simple reality that [no other Arctic state has the same means
that Russia has with which to counterbalance Beijing]{.underline}.

There are other agreements, as well, whose enduring success hinges on
engagement with Russia. An increase in Arctic tourism---a region with
lots of natural danger and little resources to respond to
emergencies---makes ensuring an adequate maritime search-and-rescue
capability a priority. This is a challenge if over 50 percent of the
maritime resources in the region are cut out of the dialogue. Likewise,
addressing Arctic environmental and marine catastrophes [and
facilitating Arctic scientific cooperation requires dialogue between all
Arctic states]{.underline}.

This is not an argument against measures taken to punish Russia for its
aggression toward Ukraine. [This is a case for protecting what is left
of the Arctic's status quo and the atmosphere of low tension that has
been the norm for some forty years.]{.underline} But [to do this, Arctic
states must reengage with Russia in basic dialogue on Arctic
affairs]{.underline} and concerns. After all, w[e cannot deter state
behavior]{.underline} in any real manner [if there is no
dialogue.]{.underline}

Of course, maybe the opportunity has come and gone. The sabotage of the
Nord Stream gas pipelines might be the clearest indication yet from
Moscow that there is no going back to business as usual with the West.
Perhaps Russia has little to no interest in reengaging with the West in
the Arctic, either. If this is the case, then ultimately the decision in
March to cut cooperation and freeze one of the few remaining avenues for
engagement with Russia will deliver only short-term gains for the West.
[Pushing Russia into Chinese (or Indian) arms will crowd the
Arctic]{.underline} in the long term [and make it difficult to
control]{.underline}. Better the devil you know than the devil with
mates in tow. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has
essentially [pulled the pin on engagement and dialogue with Russia in
the Arctic]{.underline} and according to its new Arctic Strategy, this
position will remain for "the foreseeable future." But it is important
to grasp exactly what the region is now in for. [New players, new
expectations, and essentially new interpretations of international rules
are no doubt set to emerge in the Arctic great game]{.underline}. The
question is, of course, if Washington is ready to play.

#### Tensions are increasing and risk open war, science diplomacy solves

The Arctic, so exquisitely remote, seems at times to drift beyond the
reach of global politics. In this frigid expanse, the Arctic Council, an
intergovernmental forum standing as a rare bridge, kept its most
formidable of rivals---Russia and the US---together, compelling the two
to cooperate even as they continued to lock horns elsewhere. It seemed
almost too good to be true. The enduring East-West peace once held in
the Arctic has come under unaccustomed strain due to the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, disrupting governance, research and economic activity while
challenging decades of practical and operational cooperation across the
region's vast landscapes and seascapes spanning the northern reaches of
North America, Europe and Asia. The irony is even more striking as the
Arctic States have no direct territorial or sovereignty disputes in the
region. [Threat perceptions between Russia and the Arctic
Seven]{.underline}---Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
and the United States ---[are now at an all-time high]{.underline},
particularly in the wake of NATO's recent expansion, casting a long
shadow over Mikhail Gorbachev calling the Arctic as a 'zone of peace' in
his speech in Murmansk 1987. [Non-traditional security issues like
climate change, sustainable resource development and the concerns of the
indigenous community now teeter on the edge of renewed rivalry, military
posturing and strategic interests]{.underline}. In examining the
intricate geopolitical strands in the Arctic, this Essay looks at how
India---as a non-Arctic State, with independent diplomatic ties with
both Russia and the NATO-aligned Arctic Seven---positions its interests
in the High North. The analysis posits that, despite the Arctic States'
divergent geopolitical priorities, there is a need to restore a degree
of lost cooperation. In this context, [a renewed faith in 'Arctic
Science' emerges as a compelling diplomatic tool]{.underline}, a neutral
collaborative platform [capable of bridging divides, rebuilding trust
and carving out a credible pathway for addressing the Arctic's most
pressing challenges]{.underline}.

Arctic geopolitics: post Ukraine

While Gorbachev's 'zone of peace' may be idealized, [the
Arctic]{.underline}, not to forget, [has been]{.underline} historically
[a]{.underline} silent yet [crucial frontier in the great power
game]{.underline}. From the battle lines of the First and Second World
Wars to the shadowy tensions of the Cold War and its aftermath, this icy
expanse has never drifted far from the States' strategic calculations.1
[Its value lies not only in enabling resilient wartime supply routes but
also in supporting critical sub-sea operations beneath its frozen
surface, and serving as a launch pad for missile defence and
deterrence]{.underline}. These factors, till the end of the Cold War in
1989 kept the region in a state of simmering military interest, if not
outright confrontation.

The post-Cold War era saw a thaw in Arctic relations, particularly with
the formation of the Arctic Council in 1996. For nearly two decades,
cooperation among Arctic States flourished, promising a new chapter of
stability until this fragile equilibrium was undermined on 24 February
2022, with the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. All Arctic
Council-related activities were temporarily suspended, combined with the
erosion of East-West cooperation, including Russia withdrawing from the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Council of the Baltic Sea States,
which have frayed the delicate fabric of Arctic's governance and
security.

It cannot be denied that the [Ukraine]{.underline} conflict has
[intensified military focus in the Arctic]{.underline}, [with NATO at
one end and Russia on the other, each side recalibrating defence
strategies and ramping up military presence and
infrastructure]{.underline}. Moreover, [China and Russia's reiteration
of increasing cooperation in the Arctic is heightening concerns among
the NATO Arctic Seven]{.underline}. Consequently, NATO has rolled out
its new 'Regional Plan North' that oversees the defence of the Atlantic
and European Arctic. Protecting its northern flank and securing its
vital sea routes, the plan falls under the command of the newly
established Allied Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Virginia. A decade
ago, the idea of Finland and Sweden joining NATO seemed almost
unthinkable. Today, their accession has altered the balance of power in
the Arctic. [NATO]{.underline}, once confined to its traditional
borders, now [stretches far beyond its previous reach]{.underline},
expanding Arctic land border with Russia from a mere 196 km vis-à-vis
Norway to a formidable 1,340 km---[a shift that has sparked a flurry of
military build-ups on both sides with new bases, larger and more
frequent military exercises, and the weaponization of hybrid
tactics]{.underline}. Drone strikes in Russia's Murmansk region, GPS
jamming, targeting undersea cables and pipelines, border fences, and
airspace violations have all become the new normal. What does this new
reality mean for the future of the Arctic? The [increased NATO presence
along Russia's border]{.underline} is not merely a logistical shift; it
[is a game-changer that redefines power structures and prompts a
re-evaluation of military strategies in the region]{.underline}. The
[expansion brings]{.underline} both opportunities and
risks---opportunities for enhanced security and cooperation among NATO
members, and [risks of further escalating tensions with
Russia]{.underline}, whose own interests in the Arctic are vast and
deeply entrenched. The gains of the post-Cold War period of peace
dividends and institution building now seem like a distant memory.

The strategic situation has quickly mutated into a new configuration. In
line with the NATO's 2014 guidelines, the Nordic nations with steadfast
commitment are aspiring for contributing 2 per cent from their GDPs
towards meeting the alliance's continued military readiness.2 US defence
manufacturing companies have seen a surge in orders, as the demand for
advanced military hardware from these Nordic States skyrockets.
According to US official reports from 2023, the country's trade figures
for foreign military sales reached US\$ 80 billion, a total that
includes both sales and grant assistance.3 This arsenal includes
cutting-edge systems including short-to-medium range missiles,
next-generation fighter jets such as F-35s, precision artillery shells
and munitions, and hi-tech surveillance and monitoring equipment.4 It is
worth emphasizing that the collaboration is not a one-way street. While
the US supports its Nordic partners in upgrading their military
infrastructure, Nordic States are leveraging their expertise to help
bridge critical gaps in US polar capabilities, particularly in areas
like icebreakers and polar-ready vessels.5

A review of recent national policy and strategy documents from the
Arctic Seven reveals a strong focus on enhancing strategic and
operational cooperation in the Arctic. This emphasis spans bilateral and
multilateral partnerships and aligns with NATO's combined defence
framework. To facilitate this operational synergy, many Nordic States
have granted US troops unrestricted access to their military bases,
further solidifying their commitment to collective security in the
region.6 Over the last two years, NATO Arctic States have enhanced the
scale and scope of their military exercise, testing their ability to
cooperate and coordinate across sea, land and air while preparing troops
for real battlefield situations in the Arctic. To boost efficiency in
joint operational capabilities, the three Nordic States have agreed to
establish an Arctic 'military transport corridor'. This corridor will
allow for the rapid movement of military personnel and equipment from
Norwegian ports, through Sweden, and into Finland, strengthening
regional readiness and response capabilities.7

On the other side, [Russia's Kola Peninsula, home to two-thirds of its
sea-based second-strike nuclear capabilities, has become a persistent
target of Ukraine's hybrid drone attacks in the Arctic]{.underline}.
Among the key targets are Russia's TU-22 and TU-95 bombers stationed at
the Olenya Air Base in the Murmansk region, which have been instrumental
in launching deep airstrikes in Ukraine. The intensity of military
activity in the Arctic reached a dramatic turning point in September
2024. For the first time since 1944, air alarms in Murmansk were
triggered not by a military exercise, but by an actual attack---[marking
a significant escalation]{.underline} in Arctic tensions.

### Nuclear accidents impact

#### Lack of cooperation risks nuclear accidents in the Arctic

Maxim **Starchak**, 20**24** -- expert on Russian nuclear policy,
strategic weapons, arms control, and defence and nuclear industry, as
well as a fellow at the Centre for International and Defence Policy of
the Queen's University (Canada). "Russia's Arctic Policy Poses a Growing
Nuclear Threat" Carnegie Politika, 11/1,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/10/russia-arctic-nuclear-threat?lang=en>
//DH

The war in Ukraine continues to drain Russia's resources away from
critical areas, including nuclear security in the Arctic. Despite this,
Moscow remains committed to the development of this strategic region,
and has not stopped building nuclear sites there. In September, [Norway
detected elevated levels of radioactive Cesium-137 near its Arctic
border with Russia]{.underline}. As [Russia is no longer cooperating
with other nations on nuclear safety in the Arctic]{.underline}, this is
unlikely to be the last such report.

Around the same time that Norway reported the surge in radiation levels,
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused NATO of militarizing the
Arctic through increasingly frequent crisis response exercises. Yet
Russia is guilty of the same. Its new foreign policy concepts and
doctrines call the Arctic "a vital area for ensuring our national
interests in the global ocean," and Moscow has warned that it will use
"any means necessary" to secure its interests there. Those means include
the Northern Fleet, whose ships regularly---and conspicuously---traverse
the Arctic Ocean, training to counter Western submarines.

Particularly crucial to [Russia's]{.underline} plans is its [fleet of
nuclear submarines]{.underline}, which [has become significantly more
active in northern waters in the past decade]{.underline}. The fleet
consists of twelve strategic nuclear submarines carrying up to 192
nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, twenty-four nuclear submarines armed
with cruise missiles, and ten special-purpose nuclear submarines, with
another twelve nuclear submarines under construction or nearly ready for
commission.

[The Arctic is also a testing ground for new nuclear-powered,
nuclear-armed weapons---from the Burevestnik cruise missile to the
Poseidon torpedo---contributing to both regional tensions and the risk
of radiation accidents]{.underline}.

[That risk is growing, not only because of Russia's military activities,
but also because of its increasing economic activity in the Arctic.
Rosatom,]{.underline} the state nuclear company, [operates the
eight-ship nuclear icebreaker fleet]{.underline} that is key to the
Northern Sea Route, along which 36 million tons of cargo were
transported in 2023, up from 4 million in 2014. That number is expected
to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the nuclear icebreaker fleet is
to expand by seven more vessels.

[Rosatom's footprint in the Arctic extends to Russia's two nuclear power
plants there: Kola and Bilibino.]{.underline} They do not generate
enough energy for the country's Arctic development needs (the region
contains trillions of cubic meters of natural gas and billions of tons
of oil), for which Rosatom estimates that no fewer than fifteen floating
nuclear power plants are required. The company separately plans to build
several small modular reactors (SMRs), the first of which should be up
and running by 2028.

In the past five years, [Russia's development of the Arctic has seen the
number of civil and military nuclear reactors in the region increase by
30 percen]{.underline}t, from sixty-two to eighty-one. By 2035, it is
estimated there may be 118.

In response to growing concerns about nuclear safety, Rosatom has
offered reassurances on SMRs' passive safety systems. But
environmentalists stress that [SMRs are experimental, and]{.underline}
therefore [high-risk]{.underline}. Of particular concern is how they
will be transported. It has already been reported that [ships not
designed to transport nuclear materials have been used to do just
that,]{.underline} and further nuclear safety violations cannot be ruled
out. In addition, a 2022 study found that SMRs produce more radioactive
waste than conventional nuclear power plants.

[The Arctic's radiation risks are]{.underline} therefore only
[rising]{.underline}. The situation was far from ideal to begin with,
thanks to the region's rich Soviet nuclear inheritance. [There
are]{.underline} some [18,000 sunken assets that]{.underline} were or
[remain dangerously radioactive]{.underline}, a thousand of which
continue to pose a threat. [They include submarines, reactors, and
high-level waste]{.underline}. In addition, the Russian Arctic is
peppered with facilities for storing nuclear fuel---fresh and spent
alike---and refining it.

[Ensuring the safety of new nuclear assets and managing the Soviet
nuclear inheritance is difficult and expensive, and an endeavor in which
Russia used to work closely with foreign partners]{.underline}. It was
not uncommon for projects to be 50 percent or even 60 percent foreign
funded, and some were wholly financed from abroad. The Bellona
Foundation estimates that Russia received some \$2.5 billion in
international assistance in this area, in addition to all the political,
technological, informational, and other support from which it benefited.

[Years of international cooperation on nuclear security ended with the
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Russia was cut off from foreign
funding, not only bilaterally but also through EU and European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development programs. [Technical assistance dried up
as well, precluding the maintenance of foreign equipment and halting the
supply of spare parts]{.underline}.

Institutions also stopped working together, with Russia leaving the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council and being suspended from the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency. The
European Technical Safety Organisations Network cut ties with Russia's
Scientific and Engineering Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety.

Crucially[, it has become more difficult for Russia to respond promptly
to nuclear emergencies. The Arctic is marked by extreme weather
conditions, huge distances, and poor infrastructure]{.underline}.
Notifying partners of a nuclear incident as soon as possible is of the
utmost importance, so that complicated interagency and international
coordination may commence. Yet Russia is out of the Norwegian-led Arctic
and North Atlantic Security and Emergency Preparedness Network and is no
longer invited to nuclear incident response exercises, even as an
observer.

As the 2000 Kursk submarine disaster made painfully clear, Russia was
never inclined to accept outside assistance in nuclear emergencies.
However, cooperation with partners was at least theoretically possible.
Now, [any prospect of a regional agreement on nuclear security in the
Arctic establishing a joint emergency response mechanism is as good as
dead]{.underline}.

Rosatom admits that Russia being cut off from foreign funding means
projects related to nuclear safety in the Arctic will stall. Yet it
maintains that they will not be canceled altogether, which would seem
plausible given the company's financials.

However, in practice, funding is being cut, and the results are clear.
Hitherto largely financed by Norway, [efforts to remove solid
radioactive waste from Andreyeva Bay may be suspended
indefinitely]{.underline}, Bellona experts fear.

Rosatom's accounts show that nuclear safety is not a priority. Federal
spending on nuclear and radiation safety has steadily been falling since
about 2020, and is expected to be cut by a further 1.5 billion rubles
between 2024 and 2026. Cuts of 2.3 billion rubles are planned for
efforts related to radioactive waste disposal and management and the
cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. At the same time, tariffs for the
disposal of radioactive waste are to increase by an average of 33
percent by 2027.

The opacity of the Russian state does not help matters. Gone are the
days when many projects were implemented with the involvement of NGOs,
and Rosatom's disclosures offer so little information as to be useless
as a guide to Russia's plans for the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites.

The same concerns extend to Russia's response to nuclear emergencies.
Since many sites are operated by the military or considered key to
national security, gathering information about incidents is extremely
difficult.

[Before the war, the prospect of a nuclear accident in the Arctic seemed
remote]{.underline}. It was only slightly easier to imagine one
involving a nuclear vessel or a floating nuclear power plant. [Today,
the situation is deteriorating rapidly, as Russia continues to build new
nuclear sites while halting the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. The
absence of]{.underline} international assistance and [regional
cooperation]{.underline}, along with the dwindling attention paid to
nuclear safety in the Arctic by the federal authorities, [spells further
trouble]{.underline}.

That the risks are growing is no concern to [Russia,]{.underline} which
[may]{.underline} in [fact see the peril of its development of the
Arctic as a feature, not a bug. It could form part of its policy of
blackmail, with Russia taking things to the brink to force concessions
from the West such as the resumption of financing and technical
assistance]{.underline}---irrespective of developments on other fronts.

### Solves Arctic Council

#### Science diplomacy with Russia can reunify the Arctic Council

When Norway assumed the Chairship of the Arctic Council, it acknowledged
that it is a "difficult and challenging time for international
cooperation".71 [Given the tensions, and the very real risk that Russia
may walk away from the Council, triggering two (opposing) blocks
operating in the Arctic, and the inability for the Arctic Council to
engage in political issues, common ground is necessary]{.underline}
[elsewhere]{.underline}. It is here that [science diplomacy could play a
role in recapturing the congenial nature of the Arctic Council of the
past.]{.underline} Harriet Harden-Davies outlined how [science diplomacy
has operated as a "catalyst for cooperation in international
spaces"]{.underline}72; offering opportunities for diplomacy when
geopolitical tensions are high. [Science diplomacy]{.underline}, which
Harden-Davies defined as the "use of scientific cooperation to address
common problems and build international partnerships,"73[; already has a
long and proven history of success in the Arctic]{.underline}. As
Kornhuber et al. noted, "The success story of the Arctic Council is, to
a large extent, built on scientific cooperation, recognized that
policy-making must be based on scientific knowledge".74 In an
environment undergoing unprecedented environmental change, [science is
critical to devise common goals and effective policies]{.underline} and
implement long-term adaptive management in response to new knowledge.

Since Gorbachev's then-improbable call on Arctic States to come together
to expand knowledge of and protect the regional environment, long-time
adversaries overcame entrenched suspicion and succeeded in producing and
sharing critical scientific discoveries, particularly the 2005 Arctic
Climate Impact Assessment. Even as tensions skyrocketed during the
Syrian war and the Crimea crisis, the Arctic Council was able to
continue with its research on a range of topics, including Arctic
biodiversity, climate change and marine conservation, as well as
facilitate key agreements, notably the Agreement on Cooperation on
Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic (2013) and
the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation
(2017). Consequently, returning to a strong focus on scientific
cooperation seems a logical first step to diffusing growing tension and
military posturing. As Harden-Davies noted, ["\[s\]cience can offer a
safe "port" in a sometimes stormy sea of discussions]{.underline}."75;
[If ever a safe "port" were needed for the Arctic Council, that time is
now]{.underline}.

[Science has the advantage of serving as a great unifier. It is
non-threatening, and]{.underline}, ideally, [non-competitive; scientists
recognize the value of generating knowledge, dataset sharing and
exchanging theories]{.underline}, especially in areas of research
requiring costly specialized equipment. This transmission of findings
and ideas is prized even more when it relates to pressing issues of
global concern, such as climate change or biodiversity loss.
[Collaboration]{.underline} necessarily is economically advantageous and
[increases the likelihood of more expeditious research
missions.]{.underline} Critically, though, [cooperation among
scientists]{.underline} from around the globe [offers opportunities to
engage in meaningful dialogue in a neutral setting, to create new
alliances and, importantly, to establish trust]{.underline}.76 [Through
the benign, non-threatening channel of science kernels of confidence can
blossom into alliances and ultimately peace]{.underline}. Scientific
collaboration and dialogue can temper even the most politically-charged
subjects, allowing for greater synergy between States' national
interests.77 In February and March of 2022, international Arctic
research organizations (from both Arctic and non-Arctic States) and
Arctic Indigenous groups participated in three webinars regarding the
high North. Despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it participated in all
three webinars, which "convey\[ed\] the importance of open science with
both allies and adversaries for our shared survival as a globally
interconnected civilization."78; [The ongoing exclusion of Russian
research institutes from collaborate projects is resulting in
significant knowledge gaps since Russia accounts for approximately half
of the Arctic region]{.underline}.79

Writing before the Crimea Crisis and the Ukraine war, Paul Arthur
Berkman referred to the Antarctic Treaty as an example of the power of
science to act as a "tool" for diplomacy80 and envisioned that,
following in a similar vein, "the high seas surrounding the North Pole
could become the next pole of peace."81; The events of the past several
months have severely disrupted the work of the Council and called into
question its ability to weather this latest crisis. However, [despite
the frosty relations between the Arctic Council Member
States]{.underline}, as well as between some Observers, [significant
scope remains to rebuild trust and further essential Arctic governance
operations as the region faces multiple and intensifying
stressors.]{.underline} By refocusing efforts on scientific principles
and collaboration, doors to wider strategic diplomacy will open and the
Arctic Council can get back on track. Promising signs have already come
with the resumption of operations by Council Working Groups.82
Reaffirming the original intention of Gorbachev's Murmansk speech and
[recommitment to mutually beneficial scientific projects can serve as a
vital starting point to preserve the Arctic Council even as diplomatic
relations far from the Arctic waver]{.underline}.

The development of new technologies has played a role in depleting
natural resources and degrading the environment. As a result, [the
importance of taking knowledge-based political and economic decisions in
line with the concept of sustainable development is growing. In the
Arctic, science-based decision-making is crucial because:]{.underline}

• Arctic ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to economic activities;

• [no state has sufficient financial, technological, nor human resources
to explore and develop the Arctic alone]{.underline};

• the Arctic is sparsely populated and remote from industrial centres;
and

• [researching the global trends emanating from the Arctic is impossible
without international scientific cooperation]{.underline}.

[To overcome the deadlock, science diplomacy can create a "bridge" for
finding a reasonable compromise in Arctic policy, despite]{.underline}
the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis. According to this view, the Arctic
should be considered an exceptional "zone of peace and cooperation",1
but this exceptional status was lost after the beginning of Russia\'s
military operation in Ukraine in February 2022. Finland\'s accession to
NATO and Sweden's ongoing application have radically changed the
strategic environment and increased the risk of military confrontation.
There seems to be a tendency to divide Arctic stakeholders into two
roughly equal groups: the NATO-oriented states on one side, and Russia
plus China and other states that did not support the sanctions imposed
on Russia after its attack on Ukraine. [The West has indefinitely paused
cooperation with Russia]{.underline} in the Arctic Council (AC), thereby
[provoking a political stalemate.]{.underline} Norway's chairmanship of
the AC during 2023-2025 does not promise any reconciliation, because its
agenda does not even mention the Ukraine crisis.2 To overcome the
deadlock, [science diplomacy can create a "bridge" for finding a
reasonable compromise in Arctic policy]{.underline}, despite the Ukraine
crisis. S[cience diplomacy played this role during the Cold War by
supporting various types of dialogue between the United States and the
Soviet Union]{.underline}. In the current situation [it
could]{.underline} also [improve international relations and support
multilateral efforts to address common problems, including climate
change, in the Arctic]{.underline}.3

### Arms control impact

#### Collapsing US-Russian nuclear relations risk nuclear escalation

[Nuclear risks are on the rise, and crises involving nuclear-armed
actors seem to be increasing in frequency]{.underline}, with the
potential to become a defining feature of future regional conflicts.
India and Pakistan, two states with nuclear weapons, are again
reciprocally escalating tensions across the Line of Control following a
terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in April. Pakistani officials
called India's missile strikes a "serious provocation." Recent studies
also suggest that China could rely on nuclear saber-rattling or use in a
crisis over Taiwan. [Putin's announcement of the]{.underline} full-scale
[invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} in February 2022 [included an implicit
nuclear threat]{.underline}, with Putin warning that those that
interfered would face "consequences . . . as you have never seen in your
entire history." The threat of nuclear escalation grew in the fall of
2022 with the emergence of a Russian narrative that Ukraine was
preparing to conduct a false flag operation with a dirty bomb, a move
some observers believed to be a pretext for Russian nuclear use in
Ukraine. As states increasingly rely on nuclear weapons to achieve
political goals and backstop military operations, [the risk that crises
around the world could escalate to nuclear use is likely to
grow]{.underline}.

Some well-established tools to avoid escalation and nuclear use in
crises include deterrence, disarmament, and arms control. A
comparatively underexplored idea is the use of off-ramps---ways for both
sides in a conflict to back away from escalation while still saving
face. While off-ramps were occasionally used during the Cold War, like
other tools to manage nuclear crises and mitigate escalation risks, they
must be adapted to the changing nature of conflict to account for the
unpredictable nature of modern crisis escalation in the information age.
Given the speed of conflict, including disinformation and narratives
around conflict, perhaps the most important role of off-ramps in the
current nuclear landscape is to provide a pause, but the challenge for
many leaders in implementing off-ramps may be domestic politics rather
than international ones.

Rising Nuclear Risks

[Russia's nuclear saber-rattling]{.underline}, India and Pakistan's
border skirmishes, and fears of Chinese nuclear coercion in a Taiwan
contingency are all individual data points [characteriz]{.underline}ing
[a larger trend of rising nuclear risks]{.underline}. The reasons for
this rise are many and varied. [The bilateral arms control regime that
governed much of the U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Russian nuclear relationship
has crumbled, increasing the opacity of Russia's nuclear modernization
and intentions]{.underline}. China is undergoing a rapid expansion of
its nuclear arsenal while refusing dialogue with competitors on their
nuclear doctrine or intentions. Meanwhile, many nuclear-armed states are
directly or indirectly involved in conflicts around the globe, and most
of the tools used to manage such crises have fallen victim to growing
political tensions.

Russia has increasingly relied on nuclear coercion to bolster its
conventional war in Ukraine. Initial nuclear signals from the Kremlin
were targeted at preventing NATO intervention in the invasion, with
Putin arguing that "top officials of the leading NATO countries are
indulging in aggressive statements directed at our country. Therefore, I
order the Defence Minister and Chief of the General Staff to put \[the\]
Russian Army's deterrence forces on high combat alert." In the first
year of the conflict, however, Russia also used external channels to sow
confusion and fear, with prominent nongovernment actors calling for
nuclear use in retaliation to Western aid to Ukraine. Russian political
scientist Sergei Karaganov's 2023 argument for nuclear preemption and TV
presenter Dmitry Kiselyov's recent threats on Russian TV, for example,
go against the narrower set of scenarios in which Russia's official
nuclear doctrine justifies nuclear use. These statements flood the zone
with contradictory information in an attempt to manipulate risk in the
minds of Ukrainian and NATO decisionmakers and their publics.

[Legacy tools to manage crises are under increasing strain]{.underline}.
Risk-reduction measures based on transparency serve little purpose when
one state sees value in manipulating escalation. Throughout the war in
Ukraine[, Russia has found value in playing spoiler in multilateral
forums for arms control and disarmament dialogue and has repeatedly
refused to seriously engage in bilateral arms control]{.underline}
discussions with the United States. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
experts and policymakers alike have agonized over how to incentivize
Russia to de-escalate its war in Ukraine, come to the table on arms
control issues, and refrain from aggressive saber-rattling. In short,
what are the incentives for Russia, or any actor in the future who uses
nuclear weapons to backstop conventional aggression, to de-escalate? On
the one hand, increasingly forceful demonstrations from the West that
Russia will not achieve its aims in Ukraine---and will suffer more the
longer the war continues---may eventually force Russia to negotiate an
end to the war before it slips further from its original aims. On the
other hand, too forceful a demonstration may force Putin into believing
that he is backed into a corner and has no option left but to escalate
massively and rapidly. Does the West have leverage to offer Russia
another way out of the conflict?

Science and Technology as Pervasive Influences on World Affairs

The issues addressed in this book illustrate the many ways in which
science, technology, and world affairs affect each other.2 We have seen,
for example, how economics strongly influences whether an innovation
will take place, how fast it will spread, and what form it will take.
For example, the failure to price greenhouse gas emissions and the
worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels have slowed innovation in
alternative fuels and efficiency in energy use. Similarly, the specific
needs of low-income and disadvantaged people do not necessarily
constitute a profitable commercial market, so valuable innovations
serving their needs often result only from targeted, public-spirited
intervention.

The influence of politics and economics on science is more indirect but
no less real. The emphasis on nuclear and environmental issues, for
example, led to the growth in importance of scientific fields ranging
from seismology to human geography. The end of the Cold War shifted
research funding in the United States from the physical and engineering
sciences to those concerned with health.

On the flip side of the coin, technology is a particularly ubiquitous
influence on world affairs. We have seen how information and
transportation technologies make globalization possible, and how they
revolutionize geopolitics, warfare, commerce, and intelligence. We have
seen how the possession of nuclear weapons or the mastery of information
or manufacturing technology has improved the relative economic and
political power of some countries and diminished that of others. We have
seen how the Internet and information technology has changed the
relative power of governments and civil society and created a whole new
arena of global information warfare, pitting democracies against
authoritarian states.

We have seen [advances in science]{.underline} and technology [raise new
issues, risks, and uncertainties that transcend national
boundaries]{.underline}, transform hitherto domestic policies into
international concerns, and leave governments and businesses struggling
to keep up with rapid change. We have seen how [[collaboration between
scientists and foreign affairs specialists has made it possible to
achieve international agreements on stratospheric ozone, climate change,
and nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} that bind countries of very
different and often hostile political orientations. [We]{.underline}
[have seen how [scientists]{.mark} and ethicists [in many countries have
begun efforts to devise norms]{.mark} and standards [to govern]{.mark}
the balance of costs, [risks, and benefits posed by technologies for
gene drivers and geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have seen the
unexpected effects of new technology, as the Internet has been used not
only for the free global exchange of ideas, but also for
techno-authoritarian repression and a worldwide campaign against
democratic values and institutions. We have seen how the destruction of
jobs by capital-intensive manufacturing technology has led to worldwide
populist backlash and the prospect of large-scale international
migrations.

We have seen how [technology has changed the meaning of some of the
fundamental concepts of international relations. Climate change, health
security, and nuclear nonproliferation have made hitherto purely
domestic subjects like national energy policy, epidemic surveillance,
and nuclear fuel cycles into "intermestic" issues of global
concern]{.underline}. Information, communications, and transportation
technology have limited (but not ended) the power of national
governments to control their economies and the flow of information
across their borders, powers that were once hallmarks of national
sovereignty. The thousands of daily cyberattacks have blurred what was
once a fundamental distinction between war and peace. The prospect of
cyberattack blurs the distinction between military and civilian
infrastructure and personnel because in a market economy, critical
infrastructure, such as banks, insurance companies, credit agencies, and
public utilities, is privately owned, so that a breach in a private
database may endanger national security.

Most ominously, [we have seen how the [heedless pursuit of technology
can risk catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The long-standing
[failure to rein in]{.underline} the use of technology based on [fossil
fuels makes catastrophic climate disruption much more likely, and [the
race to develop hypersonic missiles and autonomous weapons
**dramatically increases the risk of nuclear war**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In a last nod to the blurring of previously valid distinctions,
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} may all [[hop]{.mark}e]{.underline} that the
world will never fulfill the prediction that nuclear weapons will erase
the practical distinction between winners and losers in war, and that
[[we]{.mark} may [never see the day when the "**survivors envy the
dead**]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}3

Crossing and Uniting Disciplines

The ubiquity of science and technology in world affairs forces
scientists and diplomats into unfamiliar territory. International
affairs experts must grapple with concepts of molecular genetics,
artificial intelligence, nuclear fuel cycles, climate geophysics,
electric power grids, Internet security, and stratospheric
photochemistry, to cite but a few examples. They must also be aware of
the dynamics of scientific research, the attitudes of scientists to
controversy and uncertainty, the importance and limitations of
scientific models, the ways in which a scientific assertion advances
from hypothesis to accepted fact, and the sociology of the various
branches of the scientific and engineering communities. On the
technological side, they need to be aware of the time horizon of
technological innovation, the influence of politics and economics on its
speed and direction, the sociology and culture of the innovator, the
entrepreneur and the venture capitalist, and the concepts of technology
assessment and responsible innovation.

Natural scientists who wish to deal with these problems, for their part,
need to familiarize themselves with ideas that are derived from the
social sciences, law and business, and that are not part of their
traditional training: cost--benefit analysis; induced innovation,
opportunity costs, and the roles and limitations of markets; the ideas
of governance, regimes, norms, and adaptive management; the ways in
which science is (or is not) incorporated into public opinion, domestic
policy, and international diplomacy; and the political and social
influences on popular attitudes toward science and toward expertise of
all kinds.

[The links and concepts that bind science and technology to world
affairs]{.underline} extend well beyond the topics we have discussed in
this book. These links and these concepts are equally important as they
[apply to digital currencies, genetically modified organisms, food
safety, pollution, ocean resources, international watersheds, polar
regions, outer space,]{.underline} and any number of other issues in
which science, technology, and world affairs intersect.

Some of these linkages are already addressed in university departments
devoted to [[science diplomacy]{.mark}, a discipline [centered on the
role of scientists]{.mark} and engineers [as advisers to policymakers
and diplomats,]{.mark} as national representatives to foreign
countries]{.underline}, and as participants in the planning and
management of international facilities for scientific and technological
research. This [[is an important vehicle]{.underline}]{.mark} by which
scientists and engineers can broaden their horizons beyond their
disciplinary training. Other linkages are addressed by science and
technology studies (STS), an academic field that was originally centered
on the history, philosophy, anthropology and sociology of science, as
well as public attitudes toward science and science communication, but
has made efforts to broaden itself to include attention to the influence
of the political, economic, and social context on science and
technology, and vice versa. A related field of long standing is science,
technology and society (also abbreviated as STS), which is defined as
the "social, political, legal, economic, and cultural environment that
shapes research and invention, supports or inhibits it---and is in turn
shaped by evolving science and technology."4

This book began as an effort to establish the discipline of Science,
Technology, and International Affairs (STIA) as a subject that is
sufficiently important and well defined as to merit academic and
professional attention in its own right. STIA is an issue- and
equity-oriented field focused on the multifaceted interaction of science
and technology with the broad context of international politics,
economics, business, law, psychology, culture, and ethics that we have
here called the Survival Nexus. It incorporates the insights derived
from its sister disciplines: the two STSs and science diplomacy.

As we have seen in the different chapters in this book, STIA unites and
synthesizes crosscutting concepts of the natural and social sciences
that have been developed separately for the study of energy,
environment, nuclear issues, space, information technology,
cybersecurity, and the many other topics that have important dimensions
of science and technology and that span national boundaries. STIA
studies the impact of new knowledge and technology on the international
system; sets forth the international response to the opportunities,
risks, and issues to which they give rise; explains the effect of
international affairs on scientific research or technological
innovation; and explores the issues of ethics and equity that result
from new scientific knowledge and new technology.

STIA deserves recognition on its own, so that students and experts
trained in the scientific and technological dimension of one of these
fields can pass easily into the same dimension of another field, and so
that students and experts in the natural and social sciences can become
familiar with each other's ideas easily and conveniently. It is
important enough to be made part of the curriculum in high schools and
colleges.5

The Questions We Have Been Asking

All of us, whether natural or social scientists, teachers, ambassadors,
or interested citizens, need to approach the scientific and
technological dimension of policy issues with a set of questions in
mind. These are the questions we have been asking throughout our
discussion of the issues addressed in this book and constitute its
unifying themes. They vary somewhat, depending on whether we are
addressing a question of science, of technology, or of innovation.

For scientific issues, we ask: How strong is the evidence for a given
assertion? Is the information misleading or being distorted by sources
of funding or other special interests? Are there important outstanding
areas of insufficient understanding, and how long is it likely to take
to resolve them? Are these areas receiving sufficient attention, and if
not, why not? How long is it likely to take to translate scientific
findings into practical application? Are there public attitudes and
values that must be taken into account in the funding, planning and
execution of research, and the application of its results?

A different set of political, ethical, and operational questions applies
to any effort to apply technology to a global problem: Are there partial
or complete technological fixes to the issue? Who will make the
decisions, and by what criteria? Who will gain the benefits of whatever
we do, and who will bear the costs and risks? How will existing
institutions and policies affect the impact of a proposed action? What
should be done to defend the interests of people who bear the costs and
risks of technologies from which they do not benefit? How are we to
balance the costs and risks of one action against those of another? Are
there social, religious or cultural differences that must be taken into
account?

On the political side, how can we collaborate with politically isolated
countries like Iran and North Korea, for example, on the control of
infectious diseases that can readily spread to the rest of the world?
How do we collaborate with hostile countries to work out the technical
challenges involved in possible arms control agreements on cyberweapons
and hypersonic missiles? On the commercial side, how do we collaborate
on technological innovations that are critically needed for global
health or environmental sustainability with countries with which we are
competing politically, commercially, and technologically?

If the issue concerns an innovation that does not yet exist, a different
set of questions comes into play: What will be the capabilities and
limitations of the technology under consideration, and how soon is it
likely to be available? Will there be a commercial market for a proposed
product, and if not, is there a social, environmental, or security
justification for subsidies or other incentives, or for public-spirited
intervention by a government, an NGO or a philanthropy? Are there policy
or legal obstacles to a scale-up? Will the innovation threaten the
interests of someone who is profiting from the existing situation, and
if so, how can this opposition be managed? Are there likely to be
social, ethical, or philosophical ramifications to the technology? Do
attitudes to these ramifications vary by culture or political
philosophy? Will there be negative effects, and is there anything that
can be done to anticipate and to mitigate or avoid them?

Norms for Applying Science and Technology to Global Problems

[In a world in which numerous entities---from governments to
individuals---can take action with worldwide ramifications, [it is
essential that the development]{.mark} and application [of
science]{.mark} and technology [to global problems be based on widely
accepted norms]{.mark}]{.underline}. For some technologies, this may
mean strengthening of existing regimes, and restoring public
understanding and acceptance of the norms that underlie them, which may
have eroded with time. [Other technologies discussed in this
book---[hypersonic missiles, cyberweapons, artificial intelligence,
autonomous weapons, and gene drivers]{.mark}---raise new issues that
[call for new norms]{.mark}]{.underline} whose development and
acceptance will require research, discussion, and negotiation. When
fully developed and articulated, these norms should be internationally
agreed, cross-culturally acceptable guides to the behavior that is
expected, not only of governments, but also of the many other entities
that influence the Survival Nexus, including businesses, NGOs, community
organizations, and individuals. They should be clear enough to be able
to be applied to specific situations.

As a procedural matter, these norms might begin as recommendations and
guidelines from "norm entrepreneurs": expert groups, researchers,
governments, nongovernmental or international organizations, private
companies, religious organizations, or perhaps even individuals.6 If all
goes well, different versions of these proposed norms could coalesce
into principles that guide a common strategy for addressing the problem.
These in time could work their way into more formal instruments:
national and local legislation and regulations, and perhaps agreements
binding on governments and their citizens.

We here propose a tentative set of general norms and principles to guide
the application of science and technology to global problems in a
sustainable and equitable direction that is grounded in facts. These
broad norms would underlie the measures taken to address individual
problems. As a first effort and as a stimulus to discussion, we propose
the following norms and principles for addressing the issues involved in
the Survival Nexus.

Respect for facts and evolving knowledge

The Survival Nexus is complex and constantly changing. It can best be
addressed by the principles of adaptive management. Decision makers must
acknowledge and take into account the consensus of natural and social
scientists, including the quality of the evidence and any uncertainties.
Having decided on an action or a policy, they need to monitor and
evaluate the immediate results and longer-term consequences of their
actions and feed the resulting lessons and insights back into future
decisions and plans, educating and informing the public as they do so.
Decision makers also must encourage research into the scientific facts,
as well as the social, economic, political, and environmental aspects of
the problems they are trying to solve. They must support research,
development, and deployment of relevant technology.

Cooperation and collaboration

[Global issues like pandemics, climate change, and [avoidance of nuclear
war require global responses, even]{.mark} among countries with
fundamentally different political and cultural values and even [amid
intense geopolitical conflict and]{.mark} economic and technological
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This means]{.underline}]{.mark}
[negotiation in good faith on measures to deal with global problems, as
well as [international collaboration on]{.mark} basic and
pre-competitive [research on the scientific]{.mark} and technological
[dimensions of these problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such collaboration
should include research on the design, implementation, and refurbishing
of regimes and norms for limiting the risk and for maximizing and
sharing the benefits of new technology.

yet a third danger, that of [[nuclear war,]{.mark} which]{.underline}
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} wipe out millions of lives in just a few
minutes and possibly [[bring an end to human
civilization]{.underline}]{.mark}. With no nuclear war in seventy-five
years, the prospect has receded from public consciousness. Yet [hundreds
of [nuclear missiles]{.mark}, each capable of wiping out a major city,
[are on hair-trigger alert in both the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia and could be fired,

[[Nuclear war between regional powers]{.mark} like India and Pakistan
[could also have devastating consequences]{.mark} for
everyone]{.underline}.

[[The world is playing fast and loose with tech]{.mark}nologies that are
[taking us into]{.mark} uncharted and [dangerous territory. We have come
within a **hair's breadth of accidental nuclear war** several
times]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent decades. Nevertheless, political
leaders have been increasingly willing to risk nuclear war in order to
gain short-term advantage. [[Countries are competing to be the first to
develop and deploy hypersonic missiles and autonomous weapons combined
with **a**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence.]{.underline}
[[These]{.mark} weapons]{.underline} may be impossible to control and
[[make accidental escalation]{.mark} or a catastrophic accident [even
more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the safeguards that
political leaders, diplomats, and scientists have erected over the
decades to address these and other global threats have gradually been
undermined and eroded, and technologies like renewable energy that are
badly needed face unnecessary obstacles to their development and
deployment.

New Technologies Raise Issues of Ethics and Values

The revolution in information and communication technologies, while not
an immediate a risk to human life like nuclear war, has given rise to a
global conflict over whether these technologies are to continue to
embody values of access to information and freedom of thought,
expression, and innovation. That such a conflict over values might
develop was not at all apparent when the Internet was originally
designed by scientific researchers, for whom these freedoms were a given
and the pursuit of truth was a way of life. Internet enthusiasts hoped
that it would be impossible to control the free transmission of
information across borders, and that the Internet by its very nature
would undermine undemocratic governments, increase civil liberties, and
lead to desirable political change.

A seemingly unstoppable juggernaut when it was first launched, the
Internet facilitated globalization, disrupted industries, created new
forms of warfare, and at first eluded efforts at government control. The
technologies underlying the information revolution benefited from U.S.
government support to basic science, and from the much larger research
budget of the military, for whom even a small technological
advantage---the speed and maneuverability of a fighter airplane in a
dogfight, for example---can be the difference between victory and
defeat, life and death.1 Spin-offs from military research were critical
to the development of the technologies underlying the computer, the
Internet, the smartphone, and the global positioning satellite, to name
just a few examples.

The values of an open society that were embedded in the infrastructure
of the Internet provoked a counter-reaction from authoritarian
governments from North Africa to China that did not share these values
and soon became aware of the threat that they posed to their power.
After a stumbling start, these governments figured out how to use the
new technology to control the flow of information and to keep track of
what their people are saying and doing---the exact opposite of the
intent of the original innovators.

These cyber-authoritarian regimes then used the Internet and social
media as weapons for a worldwide counterattack on liberal and democratic
values. China has developed a comprehensive, technology-based system for
repression and is exporting it to other authoritarian countries. Russia
and its allies use the Internet and social media, along with television
and other traditional media, for systematic campaigns of propaganda and
disinformation intended to influence democratic elections, undermine
Western alliances, erode trust in science, and whittle away at the idea
that there is such a thing as objective truth. Terrorist organizations
use the new technology for recruiting and propaganda.

The ongoing revolution in manufacturing technology both creates and
destroys jobs and in this way gives rise to ethical and social issues of
a different kind. The new jobs it creates are likely to be in different
places and to require a higher level of education and familiarity with
computers than those being lost. This "skill-based technological change"
will continue long-standing trends of reduced opportunities for less
educated workers in high-income countries, worsening inequities and
fueling popular resentment, unless educational systems can be upgraded
and adapted to the new requirements.

The consequences of the manufacturing revolution will be even more
serious in low-income countries, where it means fewer job opportunities
in labor-intensive industries like textiles and clothing. In countries
like South Korea, these industries were the first rungs on the ladder of
economic development. At the same time, agriculture, another major
employer, is being hit by climate change. We may expect the resulting
unemployed to try to emigrate in large numbers to higher-income
countries, potentially provoking an increased populist and xenophobic
backlash.

Strong arguments can be made for both exploiting and banning the
application of gene drivers and geoengineering. Applied to human germ
cells, gene driver technology offers the promise of reducing the
frequency of inherited diseases, but at the risk of permanent and
unpredictable changes in the genetic heritage of future generations.
Geoengineering technology, if it can be developed and applied at scale,
could reduce global warming, but at the risk of tempting the world to
undertake a permanent commitment to try to control climate change
without reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. These are not simple
issues. They require a careful balancing of benefits and risks that can
best be addressed with a clear understanding of the scientific and
technological concepts at play, and how these relate to the broader
context of world affairs.

A Pervasive but Neglected Dimension

Science and technology are ubiquitous dimensions of world affairs.
Nuclear weapons have upended geopolitics, redefined great power status,
and made obsolete the idea of winning an all-out war. Information,
communication, and transportation technology have made possible the
globalization of trade and investment and the global circulation of
people and ideas. Information technology has also given rise to a new
form of warfare and has become the centerpiece of a new kind of
technological geo-economic and geopolitical conflict. [Scientific
researchers bring us a constant flow of information demanding urgent
international action on environment, climate change, and health. Many
more international issues have science and technology at their core:
investment, finance, narcotics, terrorism, pollution, oceans, water,
fisheries, and the polar regions]{.underline}, to name just a few.

Developments in science and technology raise a host of global policy
issues. Some of these are new, like the international governance of the
Internet, gene drivers, and geoengineering. Others are familiar from
other areas of international policy: How do political leaders get expert
advice and what do they do with it? How are decisions made when the
facts are still unclear? How are new ideas and new disciplines
introduced and integrated into long-established "legacy" institutions?
Who gains and who loses from any given action? Who bears its costs and
risks? Who is to make the decisions? How and to whom are they to be
accountable? How are the public and civil society to be informed and
involved?

International policymakers, business leaders, diplomats, military
personnel, and experts need to understand the scientific and
technological dimensions of the problems they are addressing. This
requires disciplinary knowledge that is not usually familiar to
international affairs professionals and that often suffers from neglect
on their part. Those who do have this understanding have often been
hived off from the professional mainstream and relegated to the role of
specialists who devote themselves to subjects they find interesting,
challenging, and important, even at the risk of losing opportunities for
professional advancement. This disciplinary divide between the two
cultures of science and technology, on the one hand, and world affairs,
on the other, is anomalous and even dangerous at a time when science and
technology are a critical dimension in foreign policy and international
business.

The public, too, needs a basic understanding of science and technology
and how they relate to the broader context of world affairs. There is,
therefore, every reason for people interested or expert in what is
happening internationally, and for people interested or expert in
science and technology, to become familiar with each other's concerns
and with the basic concepts of each other's fields. This has important
implications for our high schools and colleges.

To be sure, there is no way for any one person, whatever their
professional qualifications, to become an expert in all of the many
fields of science and engineering that have important ramifications for
international affairs: molecular biology, epidemiology, nuclear physics,
geophysics, seismology, computer science, climatology, stratospheric
photochemistry, solid-state physics, aerodynamics, and manufacturing
engineering, to name only some of the fields touched on in this book.
But neither can they be expert in all the fields of social science and
the humanities that influence world affairs, a list that includes
economics, politics, law, business, history, sociology, psychology,
anthropology, linguistics, ethics, and religion---and that's just to
start. In natural as in social sciences, we can learn enough to
understand basic facts, to relate these facts to the general context of
world affairs, and to detect obvious falsehoods.

The meshing of science with world affairs involves not only
collaboration among people trained in different disciplines, but also a
mutual understanding on the part of people accustomed to very different
roles, disciplines, and professional cultures. Science is a search for
truth about the world around us, sometimes motivated by sheer curiosity
and sometimes by the hope of practical application (applied science).2
In science, until an assertion is confirmed by empirical evidence, it is
a mere hypothesis or conjecture. Professionals in the field authenticate
research results as being backed by convincing evidence, a process known
as peer review. In the world of science, controversy is normal and
knowledge is always developing. A new theory is accepted when there
emerges a consensus of the scientific community that it explains the
available evidence better than the theory that it claims to replace. (In
science, a theory is not a speculation, as it is in informal
conversation but, rather, is a comprehensive explanation of apparently
unrelated phenomena, like the theories of gravitation, evolution, or
relativity).

Once they have earned the consensus of the scientific community,
scientific facts are facts---or at least as close to facts as humans can
make them---and will outlast any efforts to ignore them. Up to that
point, to most scientists at least, inadequate understanding means that
there is a need for more research and for more funding with which to do
it. They are by and large instinctively reluctant to speculate in public
on the answer to an unsettled question. They expect themselves and their
colleagues to stick to the science and can look down on those who
venture into popular education or advocacy. In contrast, policymakers
need to make a decision here and now, based on the information
available, however incomplete it may be. They are typically trained in
the social sciences, find science and technology to be alien and
forbidding, are unfamiliar with the sociology and cultures of the
scientific and engineering community, and do not instinctively turn to
scientific research and technological innovation as a way to help to
achieve their objectives.

Scientific advisory bodies play a key role in explaining and
interpreting scientific findings, including existing uncertainties, in a
form that policymakers can understand. These bodies can come under fire,
especially when the science is still uncertain, either because of
genuine disagreement among researchers or (as in the case of climate and
vaccine deniers) because of deliberate efforts to obscure an existing
consensus.

Integrating Science and Technology with World Affairs

[The world's experience with the integration of scientific]{.underline}
and technological [issues into broad international strategy has been
mixed. A particularly important example]{.underline} on the positive
side [is]{.underline} in the area of [nuclear arms control, in which
U.S. nuclear scientists]{.underline}, political scientists, [and
diplomats worked closely with their counterparts in the Soviet
Union]{.underline} and in many other countries in the 1950s and 1960s to
think through the technical and political implications of the
idea---radical at the time---that the world would be safer with fewer
nuclear weapons and fewer missiles with which to deliver them. [The
resulting regimes for arms limitation and nonproliferation have been
successful for many decades, although they are now under
stress.]{.underline}

[The story of the international effort to protect the stratospheric
ozone layer]{.underline}, which shields ocean ecosystems from disruption
and protects us from skin cancer, which we will discuss in chapter 2,
[is another successful example]{.underline}. After research scientists
discovered the ozone hole and brought it to the public's attention,
governments across the world worked with scientists, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and business to agree on a solution. The
international regime that emerged was grounded in facts, was equitable
to lower-income countries, and protected the rights of future
generations. Chapter 3 recounts how decision makers tried to apply this
model to climate change, with much less success.

The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Classic Example of the Survival Nexus

The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic provide a more complicated
example of the interaction of science with politics and economics. As we
shall see in chapter 7, critical decisions needed to be made and
communicated to the public in real time even as scientific understanding
of the virus and the ways in which it spread was still unfolding, so
that the recommendations of public health experts for action were
constantly changing. In response, scientists from all over the world
collaborated to unravel the secrets of the virus and to develop more
than a hundred candidate vaccines in record time. Governments and
private foundations responded quickly with financial support, both to
basic research and to vaccine development. In order to encourage
innovation and save time, they made unprecedented advance financial
commitments to purchase hundreds of millions of doses of promising
vaccines, recognizing that the resulting production facilities would be
useless if the vaccines did not pass tests of efficacy and safety.

At the same time, the classic problems inherent to the links between
science, technology, and politics emerged. Political and religious
leaders in several countries made public statements minimizing the
importance of the pandemic, suppressing scientific evidence and
epidemiological data or cherry-picking it to fit their preferences,
hyping or hawking unproved "cures," suppressing or censoring the remarks
of professional experts and attacking them ad hominem, and pressing for
reopening the economy long before it was safe to do so. There were
political pressures to award contracts to politically favored companies
or to speed vaccine development by cutting corners, as well as ignorant
or politically inspired campaigns against wearing masks, social
distancing, and vaccination.

Scientists, too, made important mistakes. Epidemiological models paid
insufficient attention to the economic and political costs of the
shutdowns they were recommending. There were also mistakes in the United
States in managing the development of technologies for testing people
who may or may not have been infected with the virus---a key measure for
controlling its spread.

Science and Technology are Not the Same Thing

If we are to understand how science and technology relate to world
affairs, we need to be clear about how science and technology differ
from each other and how they relate to one another, how scientists
express their understanding of the world through theories and models,
and how economics and politics influence the direction of research and
the dynamics of technological innovation.

We begin with some definitions. When I speak of technology, I mean any
technical knowledge that is organized for a practical purpose---not just
computers, not just hardware, and not just high-tech. By this
definition, technology ranges in sophistication from a pit latrine for
basic sanitation to space technology for planetary exploration.3 Both
are of value to humanity. When I speak of science, I mean knowledge of
the human and natural world, or the way in which scientists derive this
knowledge from a combination of theory and experiment, or the way in
which scientists communicate with each other and arrive at a consensus
as to what is a fact. Science and technology are not the same, and
"scienceandtechnology," as it is often pronounced, is a plural, not a
singular noun.

Science, technology, and world affairs influence one another. Science
leads to technology. The laser, for example, emerged from basic
scientific studies of how ammonia absorbs and emits microwaves. It made
possible the technology of the CD and the scanners in supermarket
checkout stands, both of which were far from the minds of its inventors.
Conversely, technological advance leads to advances in basic science. As
an example, the Hubble Telescope, a triumph of space technology,
transformed cosmology, the study of the beginning of the universe, from
a subject of philosophical and religious speculation to a field of
empirical scientific research.

Completing the triangular relationship, the speed and direction of
advances in both science and technology are influenced by world affairs.
As examples on the technology side, [international treaties on arms
control, environment, and human rights gave rise to numerous
innovations, like using remote sensing to identify nuclear test sites,
to measure forest loss and pollutant emissions, and to detect the
locations of concentration camps and mass burial sites]{.underline}. In
science, seismology grew in importance and sophistication when
seismologists were challenged to distinguish earthquakes from atomic
explosions. The sciences of meteorology, climatology, and human
geography likewise flourished when they were asked to support the
understanding of climate disruption. World affairs influence even the
financing and conduct of basic scientific research. During the Cold War,
for example, U.S. research support tilted strongly to physics and
engineering. When the Soviet Union fell apart, public support shifted to
the health sciences.

Scientific Models and Scientific Uncertainty

In both the natural and social sciences, knowledge typically takes the
form of a model, an intellectual construct that helps us to understand
some portion of the world, usually, but not always, involving
mathematical tools. [Models help bridge the gap between scientific
experts and government policymakers and negotiators]{.underline}. In the
natural sciences, for example, [models help predict the course of
epidemics and the consequences of climate change]{.underline}. In the
social sciences, they help to predict whether a new weapon will make it
easier or harder to prevent a geopolitical crisis from escalating into
accidental war.

In a scientific model, data and scientific principles go in, and
predictions come out. No model is a perfect representation of reality; a
lot of things can go wrong. If the inputs are faulty, the outputs will
be, too. Model builders may leave out things that they assume to be
unimportant for their particular purpose, or because they lack
understanding of matters outside their own discipline. Critical data may
not be available when it is needed most---or may depend on future human
actions about which there can only be speculation.

Still, a model can be useful even if it does not give accurate
predictions, depending on how it is used. As an example from the
COVID-19 pandemic, the key determinants of the rate of the spread of
virus infection depended not only on biological and physical factors
that were not clear in early stages of the pandemic, but also on
people's willingness to abide by mask wearing, social distancing, and
other measures to protect public health. This, too, was also impossible
to predict at these early stages. The result was that even the best
initial predictions of when the pandemic would peak in different places
were essentially educated guesses, at a time when important strategic
decisions had to be made regarding the allocation of life-saving
protective equipment and medical devices and the shutting down of
important parts of the economy. Even so, early models of the epidemic
were sufficient to allow experts to make an important contribution to
public policy, namely, to advise that efforts be focused on "flattening
the curve"---i.e., on stretching out the duration of the epidemic and
reducing the height of the peak rate of expected casualties---to reduce
the total number of victims and to prevent healthcare systems from being
overwhelmed with critically ill patients.

Part of the job of model builders is to explain the limitations of their
models. In principle, politicians and policymakers can then decide
whether or not to rely on them. Less happily, they have been known to
use this uncertainty as a handy excuse to choose the model that gives
the results most to their liking, so as to reach a more politically
convenient policy conclusion. This happened in the early stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic and of the debates over stratospheric ozone depletion
and climate change. In the latter two cases, better models, fed with
better data and run on more powerful computers, gradually resolved the
uncertainties and confirmed the seriousness of the threats. In the ozone
case, the level of international regulation increased as the level of
scientific understanding improved. In the climate case, however,
increased scientific understanding has not yet led to sufficient
international support for effective measures to address the problem.

Technological Innovations don't Always Happen by Themselves

Some of the most revolutionary innovations in history, from nuclear
power to lasers to tomographic (CAT) scanners, have resulted from
applying the results of basic scientific research. Others have resulted
from accidents, as when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin by
noticing that bacteria did not grow near the mold in a neglected petri
dish. But most innovations, from incandescent light bulbs to precooked
dinners to social media, have been the work of entrepreneurs who sensed
that there would be a market for their new and different ideas,
sometimes with new technology and sometimes by putting technology that
already existed together in a new way.

In other words, most innovations are products of the "magic of the
marketplace." This magic works only when there is a commercial market
for the innovation. A compelling need is not enough. Potential users
must be willing to pay for the innovation and must have the money to buy
it. Otherwise, there will be no market to attract private entrepreneurs
to invest in the necessary research, new product development, and
manufacturing. If there is a need but no market for a particular
innovation, only government, private philanthropy, or some other
nonprofit entity can make it happen.

This directly affects the prospects for innovations in energy
technology. Emitters of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are
not forced to cover the costs that they impose on others by way of
pollution and climate change (economists call these externalities). As a
result, the price users pay for a barrel of oil or a ton of coal does
not represent its true cost, and greenhouse gas emitters have no
financial incentive to invest in ways to reduce their emissions. There
may even be "perverse subsidies" that advantage those who damage the
environment. The government subsidies and tax advantages available to
coal, oil, and natural gas all over the world, for example, dwarf those
for renewable sources, a reflection of the political and economic power
of the companies that produce them. This stacks the odds against
renewables, despite the fact that solar and wind are not only better for
the environment but are now the cheapest and most convenient sources of
energy in many situations.

Similar logic applies to the protection of the stratospheric ozone
layer, which protects us from skin cancer. As long as refrigerators and
aerosol cans dependent on ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
could be sold without restriction and as long as their manufacturers and
users did not have to pay for the damage that these chemicals were
causing to the stratospheric ozone layer, they felt little need to
invest in developing substitute technologies. When CFC production and
sale was prohibited by international agreement, manufacturers quickly
developed and marketed suitable replacements. Technological innovation
was critical to solving the stratospheric ozone problem, but it took
place only in response to major changes in policy.

Innovations addressing the special needs of low-income people provide
more examples of orphan technologies: compelling needs that do not
constitute profitable markets. It takes a lot of time and money---and an
appetite for risk---to develop a new product or service and launch it on
the market, and most innovators want to recoup their investment quickly.
This usually means that a high-end product is first developed and
marketed to high-income people, who like to have the latest and the
best, and is scaled down for lower-income buyers only later. If there is
no high-end market, the innovation may never be developed.

This dynamic shows up most dramatically in global health. Diseases like
malaria that afflict hundreds of millions of low-income people attract
little investment from private business, unlike non-life-threatening
illnesses that affect high-income people. Public investments in
research, development, and service infrastructure are likewise largely
aimed at the problems of high-income people with more political clout.
The good news here is that technologies developed for high-income
customers sometimes trickle down to low-income people with dramatic
speed. Here an example is the cell phone, the fastest spreading
technology in human history, which has become so cheap that just about
everyone can afford it---and, as a bonus, can be used for mobile finance
and for spreading information on nutrition, public health, and improved
agricultural practices.

Still, targeted efforts by governments or nonprofit organizations are
often needed to solve specific problems unique to low-income people.
Happily, malaria and other parasitic diseases that affect hundreds of
millions of people have attracted support from governments and private
philanthropic foundations, and several cures and vaccines are now under
testing for these and other previously neglected diseases. Other
technologies to meet needs specific to low-income people are low-cost,
"frugal" innovations, which we explore in chapter 10. Examples include
an emergency food for the severely malnourished, fly- and odor-resistant
latrines, village-level systems for cataract surgery, a simple and cheap
artificial foot, and rats trained to detect land mines and diagnose
diseases. These worthy innovations do, however, raise the ethical
question of why low-income people should have to settle for such
"second-best" solutions, when better, although more expensive,
technologies are available to people who have more money.

Needed: Strengthened Regimes and New Codes of Conduct

The global issues we are addressing in this book---[stratospheric ozone
depletion, climate change, nuclear arms control, global health, Internet
governance, cybersecurity, information technology, geoengineering, and
gene drivers---demand a global response that integrates
science]{.underline} and technology [with politics,]{.underline}
economics, law, business, ethics, and culture, in what we have called
the Survival Nexus.

[To deal with some of these issues, [the world has developed global
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}, usually enshrined in formal treaties among
governments. [These regimes are [made up of established norms of
international behavior, intergovernmental institutions, scientific
advisory committees, national targets and reporting
requirements]{.mark}]{.underline}, inspections to ensure compliance,
[mechanisms for dispute settlement, hotlines for crisis
communication]{.underline}, and much more. Of these regimes, [[the most
important are those for nuclear arms control]{.mark} and
nonproliferation, [which have been instrumental in preventing
nuclear]{.mark} war [but which are]{.mark} now eroding and [in danger of
unraveling]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is in part because of new weapons
systems and changed geopolitical alignments, but mostly because of
growing distrust of multilateral arrangements and organizations.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the consequences of the long-standing
neglect of another important, long-standing international regime,
namely, the one charged with responsibility for promoting and protecting
the world's health. At the apex of this regime is the World Health
Organization (WHO), the United Nations technical agency responsible for
expert global leadership and coordination of the global response to
pandemics. The WHO has long been hampered by inadequate and inflexible
funding and a management and staff constrained and undermined by
political controls and commercial pressures, again reflecting a more
general distrust of multilateral organizations. Bilateral agencies and
private foundations have stepped in to complement its work, but the
resulting ad hoc system is still struggling with its important global
mandate.

[Yet [another need for norms arises from the advent of gene drivers,
cyberwarfare, hypersonic missiles, and autonomous
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} all of which raise knotty
technical and ethical issues that concern not only governments, but also
businesses, nongovernmental and religious organizations, foundations,
and even individuals all over the world. Academies of science and
interdisciplinary international forums of various kinds are beginning
the process of drafting proposed norms and codes of conduct for these
technologies. Ideally, these will in time become widely accepted among
people of different cultures and eventually form the basis for binding
agreements among governments of different political orientations.

Global Responses to Global Problems

The stories we have chosen to tell in this book show how [[technology,
properly managed, can]{.mark} be mobilized to [address global
problems]{.mark}. They also sound a series of alarms. [**Left to evolve
on their own in response to commercial or military demands**,
tech]{.mark}nological innovation [can lead to accidental nuclear
war]{.mark}, rampant climate disruption, or out-of-control
pandemics.]{.underline} All countries and all peoples, regardless of
their culture, religion, or political philosophy, have an interest in
avoiding these shared calamities.

We also need to defend against technology-based attacks on the values of
freedom of thought, innovation, and access to information. We need
agreed norms to limit the use of cyber technologies that can cripple
critical health, water, financial, transportation, and financial
infrastructure. We need to develop and put in place controls on
technologies like gene drivers and geoengineering that are capable of
both wonderful benefits and great environmental or genetic damage. We
need to enable everyone to participate in the economic benefits of
technological change, not just those well positioned to take advantage
of it, and to help low-income countries generate jobs, adapt to climate
disruption, provide basic health services, and fight infectious diseases
that can spread beyond their borders.

[[These are global problems that]{.mark} demand global responses. They
cannot be solved by]{.underline} the magic of [the
marketplace]{.underline} or individual countries acting alone or in
pairs[. They [require international cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline},
involving governments, businesses, universities, nongovernmental
organizations, religious institutions, researchers, and ordinary
citizens, regardless of background or affiliation. [They require
agreement on international norms of behavior, so that all may benefit
from advances in science and technology and so that new technologies
will not get out of hand]{.underline}. They require confronting facts
and complexities at a time when the very idea of scientific facts is
under attack in many parts of the world.

### Solves nuclear relations

#### Scientific cooperation improves US-Russian nuclear relations

Marie **Kirkegaard**, 20**18** -- DHS Nuclear Forensics Graduate Fellow
and Ph.D. candidate at the Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary
Research at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Oak Ridge
National Laboratory ( "Science and National Security Meet in the Arctic"

Russia's dramatic military buildup in the Arctic could aggravate an
already icy relationship with the United States.1 Russia is in the
process of reopening over 50 Soviet-era bases along its Arctic coastline
as search-and-rescue stations, deep-water ports, airfields, and
air-defense radar stations.2 [Russia is]{.underline} also [expanding its
nuclear capabilities in the region, including new ballistic missile
submarines]{.underline}3 [and]{.underline} refurbished airfields to
allow [nuclear-capable bombers to cover the polar region]{.underline}.4
[This expanded infrastructure has been accompanied by several massive
unannounced military exercises, some simulating the use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.2

Moscow has rejected claims about its "aggressive steps" in the Arctic,5
claiming that its Arctic presence is purely defensive in nature.6 The
region holds significant economic value---about a fifth of Russia's GDP
is produced above [the Arctic circle]{.underline}7---and it [is home to
Russia's Northern Fleet, which includes a majority of its strategic
maritime nuclear capabilities.]{.underline} Although Russia's growing
presence in the area may be intended solely to protect its economic and
military interests, the increased militarization of the region has
raised concerns about the possibility of conflict as melting ice leads
to competition over natural resources and control of new trade routes.5,
8--10

This ominous portrayal of [Russian militarization]{.underline} in the
region is juxtaposed against a much different description provided by
Arctic scientists. In a New York Times letter to the editor, Victoria
Herrmann, the U.S. director of the Arctic Institute's Center for
Circumpolar Security Studies, describes the Arctic as a region where
"science diplomacy \[is\] helping both countries better understand the
challenges of warmer winter."11 Despite concerns over future conflict,
the Arctic region is still marked by significant cooperation, including
between the United States and Russia. The Arctic Council, an
intergovernmental forum of the eight Arctic states (United States,
Russia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) and six
indigenous groups, works on issues like the adverse effects of climate
change and protecting the Arctic environment. Scientific cooperation is
vital to achieving these goals. The United States and Russia have worked
together on this mission through initiatives like the Russian--American
Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA), ongoing since 2004.12

U.S.-Russian scientific cooperation in the Arctic has managed to largely
weather the recent downturn in political relations.7, 13, 14 This is
important for advancing both U.S. scientific goals and national
security. For one, scientific research in the region is essential to
understand the growing effects of climate change, an important question
to the U.S. military. A warming climate will affect U.S. military
posture in the Arctic as melting ice allows for the expansion of surface
naval activities but reduces protection for submarines, and climate
change will play an increasingly destabilizing role in other regions as
well.15 [The harsh environment and lack of resources in the Arctic
preclude the United States from undertaking vital scientific research on
climate change alone, making cooperation with Russia]{.underline} not
only beneficial, but [imperative]{.underline}. For example, the United
States has just two icebreakers that can assist with scientific
missions; Russia has 40 and counting.16

Scientific cooperation has also helped the United States maintain
leadership in the region. The United States does not have the same
economic ties to the Arctic as Russia, with less than one percent of the
U.S. GDP coming from the Arctic region.17 Non-Arctic countries like
China are also looking to become more involved in the region.18 In an
increasing multilateral environment, the United States has maintained
leadership in the region in part by championing scientific programs like
climate change mitigation and environmental protection. These issues
were a key focus during U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council from
2013 to 2015. The United States, Russia, and Finland also co-chaired the
Scientific Cooperation Task Force, in operation from 2013 to 2017, which
led to the May 2017 Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic
Scientific Cooperation.

Finally, [scientific cooperation in the Arctic can improve U.S.-Russian
relations on nuclear issues.]{.underline} [At the end of the Cold War,
basic science collaborations in high-energy physics and computational
modeling fostered trust and paved the way to effective cooperation on
nuclear security projects]{.underline} through the Nunn--Lugar
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. [These efforts have]{.underline}
effectively [ceased]{.underline} in recent years, to the detriment of
global security.19 [Maintaining scientific cooperation in the Arctic on
less politically sensitive topics could potentially lead to resumed
collaboration on nuclear security issues such the remediation of legacy
nuclear waste in the Arctic]{.underline}.

International Collaboration in the Arctic

The Arctic research community has long been a beacon and a bastion of
international collaborations. International partnerships with European
and Asian partners greatly advanced our understanding of the role of the
Arctic in the global climate system. Such cooperation promotes more
rapid learning and more efficient achievements.

[Following Russia\'s]{.underline} further [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in February, [[the U.S. ceased
**gov**]{.mark}ernment**[-to-gov]{.mark}**ernment]{.underline} and
multilateral [[engagement with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that was not
in the U.S. national security interest. [[Research]{.mark} that has been
[disrupted]{.mark} [includes]{.mark} [field studies]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} natural carbon emissions, [[permafrost]{.mark}
degradation]{.underline}, large river discharges, and population
dynamics of walrus, polar bears, and waterfowl. Since Russia decided to
escalate this brutal war, [[**Federal** scientists]{.mark} have [ceased
these partnerships]{.mark} and shelved plans for new joint
efforts]{.underline}. [We have had no choice but to forgo the regular
collegial communications that enriched our understanding of Arctic
science since the thawing of the Cold War]{.underline}.

Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine has caused tremendous suffering
and a cascade of misery throughout Europe; the disruption of Arctic
science is but one negative outcome that is far outweighed by the loss
of life and threats to democracy. However, we must not ignore the impact
to science, and we remain hopeful that Russia will fully withdraw from
Ukraine and end this war. It was through scientific partnerships and
collaborations that the U.S. and Russia developed a more open working
relationship at various points in history. We remain hopeful that the
scientific friendships we developed in the past can one day pave the way
for mutual respect and cooperation in science and policy. It is for this
reason that I worry about proposals to erect barriers to future
scientific collaboration, such as a policy contained in Section 535 of
H.R. 8256, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2023, which would prohibit OSTP, NASA, and the
National Space Council from collaborating with Russia.

[The magnitude of the challenges associated with climate change in the
Arctic are simply too great for any nation to resolve in
isolation]{.underline}. [We must continue to collaborate]{.underline}
with our international partners, particularly [in field studies and
observations]{.underline}, but also by sharing results, accomplishments,
and understanding.

As noted above, under NEPA, federal agencies are only required to
prepare an EIS for "major federal actions significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment." For the purposes of NEPA[, [federal
actions include "projects]{.mark}]{.underline} and programs [entirely or
[partly financed]{.mark}]{.underline}, assisted, conducted, regulated,
[[or]{.underline} [approved by Federal
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}."121 Thus, where a federal agency proposes
to undertake a soil amendment project, that would qualify as a "federal
action" under NEPA. Soil amendment [[projects]{.mark} proposed
[by]{.mark} non-federal actors (e.g., [private
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} or companies) might also [[qualify if
the projects are funded, approved]{.mark}, or otherwise regulated [by a

however, [[the project will]{.mark} only [be considered a federal

discussed in Part 4.1.4 below, many privately developed soil amendment
projects will likely require federal permits and thus be subject to
federal control.

THE US ARCTIC RESEARCH COMMISSION

[The US Arctic Research Commission]{.underline}
([[USARC]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is a]{.mark}n independent [federal
agency]{.mark}]{.underline} created by the Arctic Research and Policy
Act of 1984 and assigned specific duties therein. The Commission is a
presiden- tially appointed advisory body supported by staff in offices
in Arlington, Virginia, and in Anchorage, Alaska. In addition to
establishing the goals in this report, [[the Commission]{.underline}
[develops]{.underline}]{.mark} and recommends [an integrated
[**national** Arctic research policy and builds cooperative
links]{.mark} [in Arctic research]{.mark}]{.underline} within the

requires the Commission to review the Arctic research budget
\"crosscut\* in the President\'s annual budget request and report to

Plan produced by the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee
(IARPC).

[USARC plays a significant role in planning and

#### The plan only governs federally funded and controlled research

//DH

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced on
June 11 that [[the U.S. will "wind down" research collaborations with
Russia]{.mark} in response to its invasion of Ukraine. [The policy
applies to **federally funded projects**]{.mark} involving research
institutions and individuals affiliated with the Russian
government]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} it [permits non-government
organizations]{.mark} in the U.S. [to make their own decisions]{.mark}
on whether to continue collaborations]{.underline}.

The announcement arrived just before OSTP Acting Director Alondra Nelson
participated in a summit of science ministers from the G7 countries,
comprising the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada. In
a joint statement, the ministers declared their commitment to
restricting government-funded research projects involving participation
by the Russian government, though they left the door open for engagement
with individual scientists.

"In the spirit of science diplomacy, we will continue the dialogue
between civil societies, including exchanges with Russian scientists and
students to the furthest extent possible, especially through the
promotion of individual academic and student mobility," they wrote.

US follows Europe in cutting official science ties

While the U.S. was quick to implement sweeping economic sanctions and
technology export controls on Russia, the White House had until now been
silent on whether it would pause or sever scientific ties between the
countries. By contrast, many European countries moved quickly to impose
official restrictions on science collaborations.

OSTP and the State Department declined requests for interviews about the
new U.S. policy but provided written responses to some questions.

Explaining why the U.S. chose to take an explicit stance on restricting
science collaborations, [a State Department spokesperson
stated]{.underline}, "Considering Russia's war crimes and other
atrocities committed by Russia's forces in Ukraine, [we recognize the
importance that we make clear what our research policy is to those who
are ultimately responsible for implementing it.]{.underline}"

[[The policy applies to both federal agencies and organizations they
sponsor, such as **national labs**]{.mark}, and instructs such
organizations to contact their agency sponsor for further
guidance]{.underline}.

In general, the policy prohibits new projects in "affected subject
areas," but ones begun before the start of the invasion on Feb. 24 will
be allowed to continue to completion. [[Federal agencies
will]{.underline}]{.mark} also "[[curtail interaction" with]{.mark}
leaders of [institutions affiliated with the Russian
government]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as with "those who have publicly
expressed support for the invasion of Ukraine."

While the policy states the U.S. will limit engagement with Russia in
"various international projects and initiatives related to science and
technology," it indicates partnerships will continue in areas where
required by "international law."

An OSTP spokesperson identified the ITER fusion facility under
construction in France as an example of a multilateral project where the
U.S. is compelled to continue engagement with Russia, which is a
founding member of ITER.

"There is no provision for expulsion of a member state from the ITER
project," the spokesperson stated. "The U.S. is in close cooperation
with its European, Indian, Japanese, and Korean partners concerning
Russia's future participation. Fusion energy science, including our
continued membership in ITER, continues to be a priority for the
Biden-Harris administration."

The spokesperson also offered one example of the U.S. curtailing
interaction with Russia, pointing to its decision in March to freeze
participation in the Arctic Council, a forum currently chaired by Russia
that coordinates multilateral activities in the region, including
research. The spokesperson noted that on June 8 the U.S. and other
Arctic Council nations announced they would resume some projects so long
as they do not involve participation by the Russian government.

Vice tightening on collaborations with Russian scientists

Beyond ITER, the U.S. also has significant partnerships with Russia
through the CERN particle physics lab in Europe. Russia and the U.S. are
not CERN member states but both are among the largest contributors to
the facility, with more than 1,000 scientists affiliated with Russian
institutions currently involved in the lab's experimental program.

CERN began to suspend interactions with the Russian government in March,
while permitting scientists affiliated with Russian institutions to
continue working there. However, today CERN announced its intent to not
renew its cooperation agreement with Russia, which expires in December
2024, meaning scientists affiliated with Russian institutions will be
unable to work at CERN after that date. CERN also plans to not renew its
cooperation agreement with Belarus, which served as a staging ground for
Russia's invasion.

Confirming the decision's impact on scientists, a CERN spokesperson
stated, "They can continue their scientific work on current activities
until the expiry. If at that time their institutions are outside Russia
and Belarus, they may continue to work at CERN. The Council's decision
applies to the countries and their institutions, not to individuals."

One outstanding question is whether Russian scientists will be permitted
to participate in projects involving the Department of Energy's user
facilities, such as its X-ray and neutron sources, which are open to
scientists from around the world. Based on statistics compiled by DOE,
220 Russian scientists used the facilities in the fiscal year preceding
the pandemic. Two Russian nuclear science institutions are also partners
on the internationally administered Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment, which will be built in South Dakota.

OSTP deferred to individual science agencies for examples of projects
that will be affected by the new policy. A spokesperson for the DOE
Office of Science declined to comment, while a spokesperson for [[the
National Science Foundation]{.underline}]{.mark} indicated the agency
[[is "unlikely to make new \[grant\] awards with Russian
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The spokesperson noted [NSF generally does not directly fund Russian
institutions but has a "handful" of grants to U.S. institutions with
subawards to Russian entities,]{.underline} often for field technicians.
"We encourage all researchers to consider whether this is the best time
for activity involving Russian collaboration or fieldwork, given the
current situation and risks associated with it. Researchers are
encouraged to consider whether their research objectives can be
accomplished through other means," the spokesperson stated.

[In NSF's grant database, a few dozen active projects reference Russia,
primarily in relation to Arctic research]{.underline}. The database
lists three grants where the primary recipient was a Russian
institution, all involving cases where NSF paid for a Russian icebreaker
to resupply McMurdo Station in Antarctica a handful of times prior to
2014.

In general, U.S. government collaboration with Russia chilled
significantly following its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, with
a key exception being the continued joint operation of the International
Space Station, which is a legally binding partnership. Although Russian
space agency head Dmitry Rogozin has made some inflammatory statements
about the ISS partnership, it has to date weathered strain from the war.

#### State-funded scientists make it [governmental]{.underline} action

Pavel **Devyatkin,** 20**23** -- senior associate at the Arctic
Institute (Washington, DC) and a PhD fellow and lecturer at HSE
University (Moscow) "Can Arctic Cooperation be Restored?" 3/28,
<https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/can-arctic-cooperation-restored/>
//DH

[We are witnessing a severing of state-to-state cooperation after
Russia's military actions in Ukraine]{.underline}. Right up
[until]{.underline} February 24, [2022, there was effective interstate
circumpolar cooperation across various institutions and
frameworks]{.underline}. Even just the day before, on February 23, 2022,
Russia's ambassador to Norway read an opening speech written by Russian
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the Kirkenes Conference in the
Norwegian Arctic. The speech mentioned "mutual assistance and
good-neighborly relations" in the Arctic and complimented the Kirkenes
conference as a setting for "constructive and depoliticized discussion
of the pressing issues of international cooperation."1)

From my experience as an American scholar based in Russia during this
volatile period, I believe most [[Russian decision makers would]{.mark}
still [be supportive of Arctic cooperation, but **government-level**
cooperation, such as **collaboration between state funded scientists**,
is]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} than ever.
Some Russian decision makers are wholly pessimistic about the return of
cooperation. Alexey Drobinin, director of the Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs' (MFA) policy planning department, said, "The period of
constructive cooperation between Russia and Western countries is gone
for good, regardless of the outcome of Russia's special operation in
Ukraine."2)

After seven of the AC states boycotted Russia's AC chairmanship in
March, Nikolay [Korchunov, Russia's Senior Arctic Official and Arctic
Ambassador]{.underline}, called the pause "regrettable" and warned that
it would pose "risks and challenges to soft security." Korchunov
stressed that Arctic cooperation "should not be subject to the
spill-over effect of any extra-regional events." Korchunov [said, "it is
of utmost importance to safeguard the project activities of the Arctic
Council]{.underline} in order to be able to pick up where we paused [and
**step up cooperation.**"]{.underline}3)

Evidently, [Russia places great importance on its position in the
AC]{.underline}. Russian experts and diplomats have said Russia's
exclusion is counterproductive and irrational. Russian Ambassador to the
United States, Anatoly Antonov, and Minister of Natural Resources,
Alexander Kozlov, have gone as far as calling it illegitimate and
claiming that the boycott violates the principles of consensus given
that Russia is the chair of the AC during this period.4) Russian and
international scientists have also drawn attention to data gaps that
result from cutting off Russian Arctic scientists. Arctic climate
research is crucial since warming in the region is a bellwether for
global climate change. As such statements demonstrate, [Arctic
cooperation with Western states is important to Russia, especially in
regard to its recognition as a great power]{.underline}.

#### Plan's funded and directed by the US government, even if on Russian territory

Pavel **Devyatkin,** 20**22** -- senior associate at the Arctic
Institute (Washington, DC) and a PhD fellow and lecturer at HSE
University (Moscow) "Environmental Détente: U.S.-Russia Arctic science
diplomacy through political tensions" The Polar Journal, v12, Taylor &
Francis database, accessed via University of Michigan //DH

**NSF = National Science Foundation, a US government agency**

[There are now fears that science diplomacy is dead in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The escalation of [the Ukraine
conflict]{.underline} in 2022 has [severely strained Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}. In March 2022, the other seven AC member
states condemned Russia and called for a pause of the Council's work
during Russia's chairmanship in March 2022. 101 AC Working and Expert
groups have been halted. Arctic scientists continue to work on research,
but 'there should be no exchange of data or official publishing,'
according to Norway's Senior Arctic Official Morten Høglund. 102 Many
other Arctic organisations, such as the IASC, likewise criticised Russia
and/or paused work. 103 Russia's Arctic officials called the suspension
'regrettable' and declared that it was important to preserve AC
activities, 'so that -- when circumstances allow -- cooperation can
continue without prejudice to those who depend on these projects.' 104
Russia has subsequently reoriented its chairmanship agenda towards a
domestic scope on the Russian North.

Meanwhile, John Kerry, serving as Biden's climate change envoy,
nevertheless expressed his hope that Putin would 'stay on track' in
combatting climate change.105 Still, high-level U.S.-Russia science
cooperation was further blunted after [[the White House announced a
termination of scientific cooperation with Russian government-affiliated
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. 106 [[The move]{.underline}]{.mark}
ostensibly [[suspends]{.mark} numerous **[NSF-funded
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} have [enabled
collaborations]{.mark} between U.S. and Russian scientists [such as
studies of]{.mark}]{.underline} Indigenous communities in Kamchatka,
Chukotka, and Alaska, the interaction of social and natural systems in
Yamal, and [[permafrost degradation across the Russian
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}107 It is now up to non-government
institutions and researchers to make their own decisions regarding
continued cooperation.

The situation is dismal as Russia's AC chairmanship and the Biden
administration share mutual interests in environmental protection and
climate change. For example, both countries are parties to the Agreement
to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean,
which commits the parties to establish a Joint Program of Scientific
Research and Monitoring to study the Arctic ecosystem. 108 [There
are]{.underline} still calls [from international Arctic scholars for
cooperation in such crucial spheres and to support the collective
benefit of a functioning AC]{.underline}. 109 Scientists who had
participated in MOSAiC said that tensions over the conflict cripple
Arctic research: ['If we limit access \[to the Russian Arctic\], we will
miss some important insights to better understand how and why the Arctic
system is changing]{.underline},' said Matthew Shupe, an atmospheric
scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. 110 In working towards
improving Arctic science diplomacy, it is important to remember these
challenges and conditions. Science diplomacy is essential for
maintaining scientific cooperation; when science diplomacy breaks down,
science cooperation deteriorates as well. In this case, science
diplomacy holds the key to reigniting scientific cooperation if Arctic
cooperation is ever fully resumed.

In conclusion, the historical legacies and modern examples of
U.S.-Russia collaborations demonstrate the value of Arctic science
cooperation and the importance of science diplomacy to realise such
initiatives. When tensions were reduced, science diplomacy as a process
produced beneficial outcomes, but it is also an important instrument to
maintain some relations even during aggravated international relations.
This is evidenced by the proliferation of scientific knowledge as well
as the opening of communication channels that builds confidence. On one
hand, cooperation can bridge inequalities in resources, capabilities,
experience, and knowledge between countries. On the other hand,
[scientific collaboration serves as a foundation for relationships
between nations and builds trust among involved actors]{.underline}.
[This is especially valuable for maintaining stability amid changes in
the global balance of power.]{.underline} Science diplomacy can lead to
dialogue between people who would otherwise be adversaries to think in
terms of common interests.

actors]{.mark} 'with effects that may be]{.underline} major and which
are potentially [[subject to Federal control]{.underline}]{.mark} and

[[Renewable energy]{.mark} developments [that **take federal**]{.mark}
tax credits]{.underline}/**[[grants]{.underline}]{.mark}** appear to
**[[qualify as "federal]{.mark}"]{.underline}** projects. Without the
federal tax credit/grant, renewable energy projects would not be
financially attractive for investors. This would lead to a lack of
sufficient funding for renewable energy construction. Therefore, the
federal government affects the outcome of renewable energy development
through the availability of tax credits/grants. Hence, [when the
federal]{.underline} [government provides a]{.underline} tax
credit/[grant for a renewable energy project, the]{.underline} [project

Permitting decisions by the Army Corps of Engineers under either CWA or
the Rivers and Harbors Act are themselves subject to environmental
review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA mandates
preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any "major
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment."184 "[Major Federal actions" include "projects and programs
entirely or partly financed]{.underline}, assisted, conducted,
regulated, [or approved by federal agencies," even if those projects are
primarily conducted by private parties]{.underline}.185 NEPA requires
the Army Corps of Engineers to review the environmental impact of its
permits under CWA and the Rivers and Harbors Act, but other actions by
federal agencies may also trigger NEPA review. While actions by CO2
pipeline regulators that do not issue discretionary permits, like PHMSA,
will not implicate NEPA,186 more discretionary functions, like BLM's
issuance of pipeline rights-of-way, often will.187 However, "NEPA is a
procedural statute only; it makes no substantive demands on the federal
agencies" and "mandates no particular result from the consideration of
environmental impacts, but only that those impacts be identified and
considered."188

P21. At the outset of our analysis, we note our disagreement with the
dissent\'s narrow interpretation of the phrase \"its schools\" in
Article 8, Section 206. Miss. Const. art. 8, § 206. While \"its\" is a
possessive-case pronoun that refers to the antecedent \"county or
separate school district,\" the dissent\'s interpretation unnecessarily
restricts the meaning of \"its\" in Article 8, Section 206. First,
[possessive-case pronouns convey more than mere possession.]{.underline}
Bryan A. Garner, The Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style § 10.17, at 186
(3d ed. 2013) (\"Use the possessive case of a pronoun to show ownership,

P22. Within the context of the broad grant of authority given to the
Legislature under Article 8, Section 201, and [given the plain
definition of the word \"its,\" the phrase \"its schools\" conveys a
broader meaning than simple]{.underline} possession or [ownership of the
schools by the school district]{.underline}. See Dye v. State ex rel.
Hale, 507 So. 2d 332, 342 (Miss. 1987) (citing St. Louis & San Francisco

\"\[C\]onstitutional provisions should be read so that each is given

Under the statutory requirements for exemption, it is not enough that
the taxpayer\'s \[\*\*\*12\] investments were \"loans secured by the
mortgage of real estate.\" The investments must also have been its \--
that is, the taxpayer\'s \-- loans. [The Commissioner]{.underline}
apparently [would have us construe the term \"its\" as requiring direct
legal ownership]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} we think [the plain and
ordinary meaning of the term \"its\" does not support such an
interpretation]{.underline}. A bank may come into possession of a
mortgage loan either by directly issuing a loan secured by the mortgage
of real estate or by acquiring a loan previously issued by another
lender. See, e.g., G. L. c. 167E, § 2(A), as appearing in St. 1982, c.
155, § 9 (a bank \"may make, acquire by purchase, participate in or
service first mortgage real estate loans of \[certain\] classes\").
Similarly, a bank\'s ownership of a mortgage loan may be legal or
equitable. See, e.g., G. L. c. 167E, § 2(B)(12), as appearing in St.
1982, c. 155, \[\*\*467\] § 9 (authorizing participation loans in which
the participating entities enter into a written agreement including
\"provisions for the custody of the note and mortgage in the
commonwealth and for the servicing and foreclosure thereof\"). [The term
\"its\"]{.underline} certainly [connotates ownership, but does not
itself provide a basis for distinguishing]{.underline} \[\*\*\*13\]

THE US ARCTIC RESEARCH COMMISSION

[The US Arctic Research Commission]{.underline}
([[USARC]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is a]{.mark}n independent [federal
agency]{.mark}]{.underline} created by the Arctic Research and Policy
Act of 1984 and assigned specific duties therein. The Commission is a
presiden- tially appointed advisory body supported by staff in offices
in Arlington, Virginia, and in Anchorage, Alaska. In addition to
establishing the goals in this report, [[the Commission]{.underline}
[develops]{.underline}]{.mark} and recommends [an integrated
[**national** Arctic research policy and builds cooperative
links]{.mark} in Arctic research]{.underline} within the federal
government, with the State of Alaska, with Tribes and ANOs, and **[[with
international partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The law also requires the
Commission to review the Arctic research budget \"crosscut\* in the
President\'s annual budget request and report to Congress on how the
crosscut adheres to the five- year Arctic Research Plan produced by the
Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC).

[USARC plays a significant role in planning and
implementing]{.underline} international Arctic Science Ministerial
meetings and other [international Arctic science initiatives and has
been involved in the Arctic Council since its inception]{.underline}.
[[USARC serves as the \"**competent national authority**]{.mark}\" [in
implementing the]{.mark} legally binding [\"Agreement on]{.mark}
Enhancing International [Arctic Scientific
Cooperation]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (see https:/

Exploration

Nowadays, [[international cooperation is a **necessary principle** in
the **exploration** of the **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Rennison,

accelerates]{.mark} the process of obtaining [**scientific results** and
improves the **quality of research**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Noble &
Maddock, 2015; Henderson & Loe, 2014). In 2003, the Russian Ministry of
Natural Resources and Ecology and the Russian Federal Agency of Mineral
Resources initiated cooperation on a series of Circum-Arctic geological
and geophysical maps. In 2005, the key Arctic states such as Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the USA signed the
agreement. After three years of teamwork, the first results were gained
(Government of Finland, 2013).

[[The chapter discusses]{.mark} the key lines of [international
collaboration in]{.mark}]{.underline} the fields of
**[[exploration]{.mark}]{.underline}** and development [[of the
Arctic]{.mark}, from the]{.underline} [first autonomous

powerful long-standing [**joint research** conducted by thousands
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[scholars]{.mark}]{.underline} from [[all over
the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. The chapter outlines the key trends of
international cooperation within the framework of the exploration of the
Arctic, as well as forecasts its development in the future. It is
expected that the long-standing comprehensive studies of the Arctic will
be continued due to the specific importance of this region for the
future of the mankind. Robotic marine expeditions will start a new era
in the exploration of the Arctic Ocean. Taking into account the
complexity and high costs of polar studies and the growing interest of
many countries to the High North, the international collaboration in the
Arctic is expected to grow.

these partnerships can bring benefits to the many nations that have
interests in the Arctic. But it requires thoughtful reflection on the
roadblocks to successful collaboration. What barriers exist to effective
international partnerships in the Arctic? How can scientists and
governments forge closer ties, and what lessons can successful
collaborations provide? Answering these questions will shed light on
important issues that will affect research in the High North for decades
to come.

**USARC = US Arctic Research Commission**

[[The commission]{.underline}]{.mark} has also [[worked with]{.mark} the
[State]{.mark} Department [to foster international cooperation in Arctic
research]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in 2016, [[the commission
organized]{.underline}]{.mark} and helped conduct
[[the]{.mark}]{.underline} inaugural, biennial [[Arctic Science
Ministerial meeting, on **behalf of the White
House**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This meeting involved senior officials
from over two dozen nations and from Arctic Indigenous peoples'
organizations. [The [USARC]{.mark} has supported and [helped]{.mark}
shape the agendas of international partnerships]{.underline} [like
the]{.underline} 2007-09 International Polar Year, and [[the creation
of]{.mark} [the International Arctic Research
Center]{.mark}]{.underline}, a U.S.-Japan initiative at the University
of Alaska Fairbanks. [Much of [the **policy work** of]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[Arctic
Council,]{.underline}]{.mark} formed a decade after ARPA, [[is informed
by coordinated Arctic research]{.mark} and monitoring.]{.underline}

The [USARC]{.underline} also [had a leading role in the drafting and
formal adoption of the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic
Science Cooperation]{.underline} in 2017, [for which USARC continues to
serve as our nation's "**competent national authority**.]{.underline}"
[The agreement facilitates access by scientists of the eight Arctic
governments to Arctic areas that each government has
identified]{.underline}, including entry and exit of persons, equipment,
and materials; access to research infrastructure and facilities; and
access to data. The agreement also calls for the parties to promote
education, career development, and training opportunities, and
encourages activities associated with traditional and local knowledge.

#### US actions pursuant to the science cooperation agreement are legally under the auspices of the Arctic Council

John **Farrell,** 20**17** - is the Executive Director of the U.S.
Arctic Research Commission "New Agreement to Enhance International
Arctic Scientific Cooperation" October,
<https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2017/2/article/27780> //DH

[The eight member states of the Arctic Council vowed to improve
cooperation on Arctic science via a legally binding
agreement]{.underline}, entitled \"[[Agreement]{.mark}
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} Enhancing International [[Arctic Scientific
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}\" signed on 11 May 2017 at the Arctic
Council Ministerial meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska. This was the third
binding agreement initiated in the 20-year history of the Arctic
Council. The first two focused on search-and-rescue and on oil-spill
response.

In short, the goal of this science agreement is to facilitate access,
whether to territory and research areas, platforms, infrastructure,
facilities, materials, samples, data, or equipment. In the words of
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, [the document [promises to ease \"the
movement of scientists, scientific equipment and]{.mark},]{.underline}
importantly, [[data sharing\"]{.underline}]{.mark} across the North.
[Barriers to research, such as denied visas, the inability to carry
equipment and samples across national borders, or denial of access to
data, preclude scientific investigation, slow progress, increase cost,
and retard the growth of knowledge]{.underline}.

In addition to access, the agreement, which was designed to be
inclusive, contains articles that discuss education, career development
and training, traditional and local knowledge, and cooperation with
parties other than the eight Arctic nations.

[[The U.S. and Russia]{.mark} successfully [co-led the effort to reach
this agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, which required several years of
discussion and negotiation **[[under the auspices
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** an **[[Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Task Force. This cooperative effort was an uncommon bright light in a
currently dark chapter of U.S.-Russia relations. This agreement, and the
Arctic Science Ministerial meeting held at the White House on 28
September 2016, are examples of how science and research across borders
can advance diplomatic efforts through soft power, rather than coercion.
Paul Berkman and co-authors published a paper on this agreement titled,
\"The Arctic Science Agreement propels science diplomacy\" in the 3
November 2017 issue of Science.

Although signed, the agreement will not \"enter into force\" until 30
days after all eight parties have indicated that they have completed all
necessary internal procedures required to enforce the agreement. At the
time of this publication, the U.S., Sweden, Norway, and Finland have
informed Denmark, the \"depositary\" for the agreement, that they have
completed the steps necessary to implement the agreement. The final four
signatories (Russia, Canada, Iceland, and Denmark) have yet to inform
the depositary.

Each party identified geographic areas over which the agreement
pertains. These are contained in an annex to the agreement. The U.S.
Department of State has created a map that graphically displays these
areas (see Figure 1).

For the U.S., the area is the Arctic region as defined in the Arctic
Research and Policy Act of 1984 as amended, and is \"All United States
territory north of the Arctic Circle and north and west of the boundary
formed by the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; the Aleutian
chain; and adjacent marine areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort,
Bering, and Chukchi Seas.\" Maps of the U.S. Arctic may be found on the
U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC) website.

In practice, will this agreement enhance Arctic scientific cooperation?
While the intent is positive, some question whether it will do so, as
the document has several escape clauses.

For example, the agreement includes phrases such as, \"...shall use
their best efforts...,\" and \"Implementation of this Agreement shall be
subject to the availability of relevant resources.\" And Article 10
reads, \"Activities and obligations under this Agreement shall be
conducted subject to applicable international law and the applicable
laws, regulations, procedures, and policies of the Parties concerned.
For those Parties that have subnational governments, the applicable
laws, regulations, procedures, and policies include those of their
subnational governments.\"

So, it remains possible to deny access despite best efforts that fail,
or to insufficient resources to facilitate access, or to existing
procedures or policies that run counter to the goals of the agreement.

In essence, the validity of the agreement will only be determined when
it is exercised. If denials of access and other challenges can be
overcome through discussion and negotiation facilitated under this
agreement, then it will have merit. The proof will be in the pudding.

The parties to the agreement are currently in the process of
establishing specific procedures and processes necessary to implement
the agreement, and a Terms of Reference may be established.

Generally speaking, Arctic researchers have benefitted from good access
to the pan-Arctic region, but this is not always the case. For example,
entering the Russian Federation has sometimes proven difficult. Between
1990 and 2014, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[Department of]{.mark}
[State submitted 48 requests to Russia for U.S. vessels to conduct
marine scientific research in the Russian Exclusive Economic
Zone]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of those requests, 20, representing 42%, were
either denied or elicited no response, which the State Department
considers to be denial of access (See Figure 2).

[In the agreement, each party designated an entity to serve as [the
\"competent national authority\" as the]{.mark} responsible point of
contact]{.underline} for the agreement. [The United States selected the
[U.S. Arctic Research Commission]{.mark}]{.underline}. Projecting
forward, we look forward to exercising the optimism and enthusiasm for
cooperation displayed in the effort to reach this agreement and to
facilitating research for the greater good.

## Exploration

### 2ac -- T exploration is research

#### Arctic exploration means [discovery of the unknown]{.underline} -- that's either [research]{.underline} or [resources]{.underline}

[[Exploration might be]{.mark} an act of [discovering an **unexplored
place** **or**]{.mark} discovering [**an unfamiliar subject**; in
both]{.mark} cases, **[an "unknown" is required]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
John Franklin sought to sail through an unknown passage; Robert Peary
and Frederick Cook tried to reach the mythic North Pole. Explorers made
the imaginary Thule real.

Depending on the era of exploration, [the principal actors in the Arctic
have changed]{.underline} over the centuries. Until the start of the
twenty-first century, traditional "explorers" acted in the Arctic.
Compared to the explorations in the previous centuries, [[contemporary
efforts to explore the Arctic originate from **oil**]{.mark} and gas
[**companies** and **scientists**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} employ different methods and techniques and
[[have different motives for exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Consequently, [[as the "unknown" elements of the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} have evolved and
[[changed]{.underline}]{.mark}, so has [[the "subject" of exploration
transformed as well.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Previous explorations leading up to the twenty-first century certainly
increased the geopolitical importance of the Arctic, as nations
developed new fishing grounds and new shipping routes. Subsequent
colonization of parts of the Arctic (Russian rule in Alaska, the Hudson
Bay Company in Canada, and the Bergen Greenland Company of Norway and
Denmark) paved the way for additional economic activities, such as fur
trading (Norman, 2018: 2).

Early economic and scientific explorations were financed by states
primarily to promote their interests in expanding their reach in the
areas of the Arctic considered terra nullius. Since then, the increasing
pressure of globalization on the nation-state system in the twenty-first
century promoted new actors in Arctic exploration, such as IGOs
(intergovernmental organizations), NGOs (non-governmental
organizations), private companies and multinational investors. Indeed,
the term "explorer" today is largely used as a metaphor, since the type
of exploration has evolved from discovering unknown territory to
developing new economic activities, such as the exploration of oil and
gas deposits by companies. In such cases, the new explorers are
companies.

[[Climate change has become]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[the most
important]{.mark} [motive]{.mark}s [for scientific
exploration]{.mark},]{.underline} as we seek to understand the causes
and impacts of the warming Arctic[. [These explorations
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[financed by
states]{.underline}]{.mark} but also by NGOs, private companies or
international organizations. Scientists, Indigenous peoples and other
Arctic residents also take part in these projects.

### 1ar -- exploration is research

#### Exploration means [scientific]{.underline} or [economic]{.underline} discovery

[The nature of [exploration in the Arctic has changed]{.mark} in the
twenty-first century [because of]{.mark}]{.underline} the increasing
effects of [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has created a
new political and economic Arctic agenda in terms of physical changes of
the ocean, easier access to oil and gas deposits, new shipping routes,
new fishing areas and growing global interest in the Arctic Council.
Climate change has also magnified the effect of globalization in the
Arctic as a new global phenomenon. Thus, the Arctic is attracting the
attention of non-Arctic world.

[During this new era in the Arctic, [scientific and economic exploration
go hand in hand]{.mark}]{.underline} for some Arctic states such as
Russia, where including scientists in economic exploration efforts is
compulsory. Scientists from Russia interviewed for this chapter indicate
that they joined several explorations with Rosneft and conducted their
own scientific research on sea ice.4 In Norway, Equinor has always
cooperated with universities and other research institutions. Ørjan
Birkeland5 says that it is expected that the industry creates
sustainable ripple effects in the societies in which they work, and this
also implies engagement of universities. Equinor has agreements and
sponsorship programs with several universities and supports research
programs in their areas of interest, such as geology and energy
distribution; sometimes the company sponsors independent research
projects of universities (e.g., from Norway, United Kingdom, Germany and
other countries). In other situations, Equinor funds research projects
to examine a specific issue that it wants to be analyzed. In these ways,
scientific involvement on the part of private companies is implemented
on different levels.6

On the other hand, oil and gas exploration involves very different
methods and means from the type of exploration undertaken in previous
times. [Modern efforts related to oil and gas development require
expertise in geology and seismology]{.underline} and in related
technological fields. Oil and gas companies must plan their explorations
years in advance, and sometimes face failure. For example, Norway
conducted an important oil exploration in Barents Sea in 2017 with
disappointing results. However, the chief executive of Statoil (by 2018
Equinor) stated that the government-controlled company was "very
patient" when it came to exploring new areas and that it would return to
the Norwegian and Barents Seas the following year with "optimism but
realism" (Milne, 2017). Indeed, Statoil resumed exploration between 2017
and 2019 in the Barents Sea, developing exploration wells in the areas
of Jøkåsen, Gjøkåsen Deep, Korpfjell Deep, Sputnik and Mist.7 The
"exploration" page of the Norwegian state-owned company Equinor's
website displays its purpose as: "Inspiration from a history of
explorers. Building on a heritage of adventurers, Equinor has become a
world-leading explorer for oil and gas."8 It is obvious that
[**[scientific exploration]{.mark}** [and **economic exploration**
methods differ greatly, but the notion of "exploration" is fundamental
in this new era]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Conducting **[science-based explorations]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
order [[to understand]{.underline}]{.mark} the how and whys of [[climate
change is necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} to mitigate its effects.
However, if the United States, as a superpower, remains unsupportive of
these kinds of scientific endeavors, it would have significant economic
and symbolic impacts. First, the conduct of long-term or short-term
[[scientific exploration in the Arctic is very expensive]{.mark} because
of the remoteness]{.underline} of the region. Therefore, [[U.S.
financial aid is crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second, the contribution
and presence of one of the great powers of the Arctic symbolically
enhances the significance of scientific efforts. The Third International
Polar Year was organized in 1957 in the middle of the Cold War and
suffered from political tensions. The bipolar world of those days
undermined both eastern and western scientific effort. Ironically, in
today's multipolar era, science suffers again because of power politics.

#### Our definition best reflects [contemporary]{.underline} exploration of the Arctic

Thor B. **Arlov**, 2**023** -- Assistant Professor of History,

<https://www.unis.no/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/summary05.pdf>

The concepts "research" and "exploration" are often used
indiscriminately about scientific or science related activities in the
past. [[Though we might like to think of]{.underline}]{.mark} research
as systematic, scientific studies and [[exploration]{.mark}]{.underline}
rather [[as]{.mark} the process of [discovering new
territories]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[it]{.mark} [is important to
interpret]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} two
[c[oncept]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} their
**[[contemporary context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What we may regard
today as a pure discovery expedition might have been viewed in the past
as advanced science.

Polar research as a specific term probably originated in Germany in the
19th century -- "Polarforschung" became a scientific discipline. Today,
however, we realize that polar research is not defined as a particular
discipline but is a geographical definition: research that is dedicated
to polar areas of the world. Typically, it is field based,
multidisciplinary, international, and very expensive. It is also typical
that polar research is motivated by more than scientific curiosity --
individual and national prestige, economic and political interests are
also important. Nonetheless, international cooperation is prevalent in
polar research.

Karl Weyprecht and Georg von Neumayer's initiative in the 1870s to
organize the first International Polar Year (1882--83) was a turning
point in making polar research more focussed on science, less on heroic
exploration and discovery. On Svalbard the Swedes manned the IPY station
at Kapp Thordsen, with great success.

The [([scientific) exploration of Svalbard may be divided into different
phases]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example:

• 1596--[[1720: First discovery, geographical
exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}, mapping

• 1720--1850: Development of natural science, North Pole expeditions

• 1850--1900: First "golden age" of Svalbard science; Swedish hegemony

• 1900--1945: Geology and land claims; Norwegian hegemony; economic
crisis

• 1945--[**[today]{.mark}**: [International

However, [the Arctic Council]{.underline}\'s secretariat
[said]{.underline} in February **[it would resume working group
meetings]{.underline}** on environmental and safety issues [in a virtual
format, **with Russia at the table**,]{.underline} and some analysts saw
grounds for hope.

\"What we\'re seeing [during Norway\'s chairship shows that cooperation
is still possible]{.underline},\" said Pavel Devyatkin, a Moscow-based
researcher with the U.S. think tank the Arctic Institute.

[The Council working group]{.underline} dedicated to monitoring the
region\'s climate and environment [will soon publish three
reports]{.underline} --- on changes to the Arctic climate, microplastic
pollution and radioactivity --- that had been delayed by the Ukraine
war.

[The radioactivity report required significant input from
Moscow]{.underline} as it has a Russian co-lead author and includes
extensive Russian data, said Rolf Roedven, executive secretary of the
Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme working group.

Norway and Russia share an Arctic border, and collaborate on practical
issues such as managing fisheries in the Barents Sea --- work which has
continued since the invasion of Ukraine.

[Pragmatic cooperation at the technical or scientific level may be the
way to go, but contacts at the political level on the Council are
unthinkable]{.underline} while the war continues, officials said.

\"We have to adapt to a new reality,\" Hoeglund said. \"We have to
accept \... that this is a different reality than it was four years ago.
It is certainly not going to be anything resembling what it was back
then\".

Rather, [the war is hardening into a grinding stalemate]{.underline} ---
one [that threatens to **exhaust Ukraine**]{.underline}, [**fracture
Western unity** and **empower** the]{.underline} very **[regime it was
meant to weaken]{.underline}**. The question Western policymakers must
now confront is not whether Ukraine deserves support, but whether the
current strategy is helping it win, or simply helping it survive long
enough to lose more slowly.

This doesn't mean Ukraine should surrender, nor does it mean abandoning
Western support. It does, however, demand an honest reckoning[: There is
no pathway to]{.underline} total [Ukrainian victor]{.underline}y --- and
pretending otherwise is no substitute for strategy.

Where we are today, preserving Ukraine's sovereignty and stabilizing
Europe may depend less on weapons than on diplomacy.

On paper, the West is still backing Ukraine robustly. The latest \$61
billion U.S. aid package passed after months of political gridlock;
European countries are slowly scaling up defense production; and NATO
continues to signal resolve. But [the military reality is more sobering
than many Western headlines suggest]{.underline}.

Firstly, [Ukraine faces a demographic cliff]{.underline}: According to
its own defense ministry, [over 30 percent of conscripts are failing to
report for duty]{.underline}. New mobilization laws are lowering the
draft age to 25, but recruitment shortfalls persist. And [the country's
population is shrinking due to emigration and war
casualties.]{.underline}

Additionally, [the economy has suffered a severe contraction from the
war]{.underline}, greatly impacting infrastructure, industry and
livelihoods. With emergency powers wearing thin and frustration mounting
over corruption and mismanagement, **[political tensions are rising in
Kyiv]{.underline}**.

[Russia]{.underline}, meanwhile[, has adapted. Its economy is now on a
war footing; its defense industry is outproducing the West]{.underline}
in artillery shells[; and its military]{.underline} --- though
inefficient and brutal --- [maintains the advantage]{.underline} in
manpower and strategic depth[. Its political leadership has also
internalized long-term costs in pursuit of minimal territorial
gains]{.underline}.

[The idea that Russia might still lose]{.underline} the war in Ukraine
[has become a]{.underline} kind of security blanket for Western elites
-- [a comforting illusion clutched in think tanks]{.underline},
editorial pages, and official briefings [long after the battlefield
realities have changed]{.underline}. We are now well past the phase
where optimism could be excused as ignorance. The facts are in.
**[Ukraine is exhausted.]{.underline}** [The West is demoralized. And
Russia]{.underline}, despite its many internal challenges, [is grinding
toward its war aims]{.underline} with brutal consistency.

Let's be clear: if by "lose" we mean military defeat on the battlefield,
collapse of the Russian economy, or regime implosion in Moscow, then no
-- Russia is not going to lose. Not this year, and not under the current
trajectory. [All the major structural forces -- military, economic,
political---are now moving in Russia's favor]{.underline}. The war is
not over, but the outcome is no longer up for grabs.

Start with the military situation, because that's the foundation of
everything else. On the ground, [Ukraine's strategic position is
deteriorating by the month]{.underline}. Mobilization efforts have
stalled. [Recruitment has collapsed]{.underline}. The average age of a
frontline soldier is now nearing 45. Desertion and draft-dodging are
spreading, [and Western aid]{.underline} -- though still flowing -- is
[increasingly mismatched to Ukraine's real needs]{.underline}. You can
send as many artillery shells and drone kits as you like, but you cannot
manufacture trained infantry out of nothing. And that's what Ukraine is
short of: not resolve, not hardware, but men.

Meanwhile, [Russia's army]{.underline} has evolved. It's no longer the
chaotic, overstretched force that stumbled out into Ukraine in February
2022. It has absorbed its losses, adapted to the terrain, and [reverted
to what it does best: attritional warfare, backed by overwhelming
firepower and deep reserves]{.underline} of manpower. Russia doesn't
need to stage flashy counter-offensives or overrun all of Ukraine. It
only needs to advance slowly, dig in, and bleed Ukraine white -- while
maintaining pressure long enough to outlast Western political will. And
that's exactly what it's doing.

Which brings us to the economic front. [There's a persistent myth in
Western capitals that Russia is teetering under the weight of
sanctions]{.underline} --that the ruble is crumbling, the oligarchs are
restless, and the economy is one shock away from implosion. [This is
wishful thinking.]{.underline} Sanctions have hurt, yes, but they have
also catalyzed a strategic decoupling from the West that was probably
inevitable anyway. [Russia has reoriented its economy toward
Asia]{.underline}. It's selling oil to India, natural gas to China, and
arms to anyone willing to pay in non-Western currencies. The parallel
financial system is crude but functional. And [the state is compensating
for consumer losses with heavy military-industrial spending]{.underline}
-- spending that, unlike in the West, is tied directly to battlefield
outcomes and regime survival.

The IMF projects modest growth for Russia in 2025. Inflation is high,
but not catastrophic. Unemployment is low. And industrial output --
especially in arms production -- is booming. Yes, living standards have
declined. But the state has managed the pain selectively, shielding key
groups -- soldiers, pensioners, the security apparatus -- while letting
the rest of society absorb the shock. It's crude economic triage. But it
works. And it buys time.

Opting to sustain or even increase current levels of U.S. military and
intelligence aid to Ukraine would delay defeat, but not prevent it.
[Many point to the slow pace of Russia's advance along the front line as
a sign that Ukraine can sustain a stalemate]{.underline} with sufficient
Western political will. But gauging Ukraine's fortunes by tracking
Russia's progress on the map is misleading. [In a war of attrition,
progress is measured not by battlefield breakthroughs, but by how
many]{.underline} well-trained and well-equipped [troops each side can
put in the field.]{.underline}

[By this metric, Ukraine is in big trouble]{.underline}. [Russia's
defense industry is greatly outproducing U.S. and European military
factories in such critical munitions as artillery shells, and it is
assembling attack missiles at a faster rate than the West can produce
air defense missiles]{.underline}. At least [a million Ukrainians have
been killed or wounded]{.underline} on the battlefield; many millions
more have fled the fighting for Europe, Russia, and beyond.

[Although Russia has also suffered great casualties, it has five times
Ukraine's]{.underline} current [population and has employed sound
approaches to training and replenishing its forces]{.underline}. [These
trends point not to a]{.underline} long-term [stalemate, but to
a]{.underline} World War I-style **[Ukrainian implosion]{.underline}**
sooner or later, probably during Trump's term in office.

#### It's not a stalemate, Ukraine will lose now

//DH

In a stalemate? No, [the war is not in a stalemate, but the Russians
continue winning on the ground]{.underline}. Last week [the New York
Times revealed that in the previous 16 months, the Russians had captured
1,826 square miles of Ukrainian territory]{.underline}. The article
conceded that the Ukrainian casualties could have a catastrophic
consequence, noting that in "wars of attrition, [incremental gains can
presage a breakthrough, if the losing side runs out of troops and
ammunition and its defensive lines finally collapse]{.underline}."

This is on top of the October 2024 New York Times story that reported
that [Russia had been seizing Ukrainian territory every month since
November 2022]{.underline}. In recent days, the commander of the elite
47th Mechanized Brigade in Ukraine had quit his post because "the stupid
loss of people, trembling in front of a stupid generals, leads to
nothing but failures." while the Ukrainian leadership fired the
commander of the 59th Brigade.

If Zelensky and his European backers believe that the beleaguered
Ukrainian Army can continue to fight, indefinitely, losing thousands of
troops every month, and there will never be a break in the lines -- or a
revolt from the troops -- they are playing, pardon the pun, Russian
Roulette. No one can suffer those kinds of losses and fight like robots
forever.

Consider also that the fact that after Biden's \$61 billion aid package
from May 2024 runs out, there is no more American aid coming. [Europe
clearly cannot make up the absence of American military aid on its
own]{.underline}. Therefore, potentially [within months, battlefield
math will start to increasingly weigh against the Ukraine side, while
Russia will only continue getting stronger]{.underline} and bigger
militarily.

### 2ac -- appeasement now

#### Trump's backing Putin over Ukraine in negotiations now

Mark **MacKinnon**, 20**25** -- journalist "When Ukraine lost a seat at
its own table" The Globe and Mail, 2/21
<https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-zelensky-loses-a-seat-at-his-own-table-as-trump-and-putin-decide/>
//DH

Three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the
full-scale invasion of Ukraine -- declaring he wanted to alter the
country's borders, change the government in Kyiv and drive back the
frontiers of the NATO alliance -- U.S. President Donald [Trump appears
to be pushing for a peace deal that would give the Russian
leader]{.underline} almost [everything he's been seeking]{.underline}.

[The defenestration of previous U.S. policies toward]{.underline} Russia
and [Ukraine was swift]{.underline} and chaotic. [First, it
was]{.underline} U.S. Secretary of Defence, Pete [Hegseth,
telling]{.underline} what was supposed to be a gathering of Ukraine's
[allies]{.underline} in Brussels on Feb. 12 [that Kyiv's main goals in
any peace settlement]{.underline} -- restoring the country's territorial
integrity and securing North Atlantic Treaty Organization protection
against a future Russian attack -- [were "unrealistic]{.underline}."
This one speech from Mr. Hegseth, less than three weeks into his job,
upended more than a decade of Western promises and support for Ukraine.

[Next it was]{.underline} Mr. [Trump]{.underline} himself [launching a
stunning broadside against]{.underline} Ukrainian President Volodymyr
[Zelensky]{.underline}, saying the leader had only 4 per cent support
(even as a poll taken this week found 57 per cent of Ukrainians trusted
their President). When Mr. Zelensky pushed back by suggesting Mr. Trump
must have gotten his numbers from a made-in-Moscow "disinformation
sphere," Mr. Trump escalated to falsely calling Mr. Zelensky "a dictator
without elections."

Mr. [Trump's suggestion that]{.underline} Mr. [Zelensky]{.underline} --
who won election in 2019 with 75 per cent of the vote, but postponed a
scheduled 2024 election because of the Russian invasion [--
was]{.underline} somehow [an illegitimate leader could have been written
by the Kremlin]{.underline}, which has been pushing the same theme
through its propaganda outlets since Mr. Zelensky's official term
expired last April. Tellingly, Mr. Trump had no qualms dealing with Mr.
Putin, despite the Kremlin not having allowed anything like a
competitive election for more than two decades.

Suddenly, Ukraine, a country that for the past three years has been the
largest recipient of U.S. military and economic assistance, is at odds
with its biggest patron. Mr. Trump appears to want Ukraine to accept a
peace deal that it will have no hand in negotiating. And the heavy
suggestion is that if Mr. Zelensky doesn't play along, Ukraine may be
forced to fight on without U.S. help.

"Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,"
Mr. Trump posted Wednesday on his Truth Social account. "In the
meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with
Russia."

Those negotiations began Tuesday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, as U.S.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov, with Ukraine not at the table but clearly on the menu.

One supposed version of the deal being contemplated, published on social
media by Fox News journalists travelling with Mr. Rubio, envisions a
three-stage plan that calls for an immediate ceasefire, followed by
elections in Ukraine. Only then would negotiations begin toward a
longer-term peace deal.

It's the second phase -- Ukrainian elections, called for not by
President Zelensky, but by Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin -- that had jaws
dropping in Kyiv, and among Ukraine's remaining allies in the West. Such
a vote would require Ukraine to suspend martial law before the war was
over, imperilling the country's mobilization drive and igniting
political infighting the Kremlin could take advantage of.

Mr. [Trump's willingness to bully Kyiv while making nice with Moscow has
shocked]{.underline} long-standing [U.S. allies]{.underline}, including
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer,
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, all
of whom pushed back at Mr. Trump's suggestion that Mr. Zelensky was
anything other than Ukraine's legitimately elected leader.

Supporters of Ukraine wonder why Mr. Trump -- who claims to be a master
negotiator -- has already given Mr. Putin a major concession by ending
three years of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Moscow, while getting nothing
in return so far.

"So far, we're seeing some sort of discussion, bilateral negotiations of
some kind, playing out entirely on the terms of an autocratic state that
is the main aggressor in a war of aggression against a European
neighbour," said Olga Onuch, professor of Ukrainian politics at the
University of Manchester. "[I would think the Kremlin is saying, 'This
new administration in the United States is a **great deal weaker than we
thought**]{.underline}, [they are doing exactly what we would
like]{.underline} to see happen.' But peace, the Russians aren't
interested in peace."

### 1ar -- appeasement now

#### Current appeasement threatens the rules-based international order

Michael **Bociurkiw**, 20**25** - is a global affairs analyst and senior
fellow at the Atlantic Council. "What will 'peace' even mean for
Ukraine?" The Globe and Mail, 2/18,

<https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-what-will-peace-even-mean-for-ukraine/>
//DH

Donald [Trump]{.underline} and his circle [continue to
paint]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin as a man yearning for peace, gifting
the Russian President the geopolitical optics of the **first high-level
bilateral meeting** since 2021]{.underline} on Tuesday. But [it is also
a door-opening for]{.underline} Mr. [Putin to press for a smorgasbord of
concessions]{.underline} that would have been unthinkable just a few
weeks ago; already, [Moscow appears to have been granted its wish for
restrictions to be lifted on its diplomatic mission in the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

The Kremlin's conditions for ending its so-called "special military
operation" in Ukraine include a freeze of current borders, allowing
Russia to retain two partly occupied oblasts; the lifting of Western
sanctions; a block on Ukraine's NATO bid; and recognition of Crimea as
Russian. His asks could even extend to unfreezing more than
US\$300-billion of Russian central bank assets and the withdrawal of
NATO forces from front line countries.

So far little has come out of Tuesday's summit, led by U.S. Secretary of
State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. (Putin
aide Yuri Ushakov summed up the 4.5 hours of talks in Riyadh as "not
bad, not bad.") But the U.S. delegation confirmed that territory and
security guarantees will be on the table in future negotiations.

Meanwhile, as talks proceed without Kyiv's participation, Ukraine sees
no sign that the man that Mr. Trump is making out to be a peacemaker
will halt his daily missile and drone attacks in the bloodiest European
conflict since 1945. Mykolaiv Oblast, near Odesa, was hit by drones over
the weekend, cutting off power and heating for 100,000 people amid a
brutal cold snap.

Ukrainians are well aware that a transactional Mr. Trump is eager for a
big win around Ukraine. After all, this is an image-obsessed man -- he
promised to end the war in 24 hours, though he later extended that
timeline by several months -- who racked up failures in North Korea,
Afghanistan and the Middle East.

The question is: What price will Ukraine ultimately pay for Mr. Trump's
schoolyard-bully diplomacy?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country would not
recognize any agreements made without its involvement. "We want
everything to be fair and so that nobody decides anything behind our
back," he said on Tuesday. However, if the U.S. and Russia decide on a
truce and Kyiv refuses to accept it, Ukraine has little leverage. Mr.
Trump, who has said Ukraine "may be Russian some day," could cut off
Kyiv's access to vital intelligence and targeting information, or even
disable the Patriot missile defence systems protecting Ukrainian cities.
Mr. Trump's approach to Ukraine resembles that of a slumlord: he is
reportedly demanding repayment (up to half a trillion U.S. dollars for
U.S. aid) without offering any security guarantees, which Mr. Zelensky
has already rejected. One source described Mr. Trump's approach as "pay
us first, then feed your children."

Looming over Washington's outsized influence to decide Ukraine's fate is
the negligence of leaders in Britain, Canada and Europe to up their
defence spending to this point and wean themselves off American
largesse. If the U.S. were to abandon Ukraine tomorrow, European allies
would be in no position to pick up the slack. It now appears Russia
would face few headwinds should it decide to expand its conflict
westward.

Even if Britain raised its defence spending to 2.5 per cent of its GDP,
it would cost the country billions. Sending a credible peacekeeping
force to Ukraine would require at least 30,000 soldiers, with 10,000
stationed on an enduring basis, according to British military analyst
Sean Bell.

There are many questions ahead, including whether European leaders will
follow British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent pledge to send
peacekeepers to Ukraine, a proposal that has already been met with
resistance in Berlin and Warsaw. Will Mr. Putin, who launched the war,
in part, because he alleged that NATO was expanding unchecked, tolerate
NATO troops on Ukrainian soil? (Unlikely.) And can NATO countries even
field the tens of thousands of soldiers required to staff an effective
peacekeeping force?

In the three-plus years I've spent on the ground in Ukraine, the mood
has never been darker. Fatigue, deep wounds from spilled blood and a
sense of betrayal are weighing heavily on citizens and soldiers alike.
From the beginning, they've seen themselves not just as defending their
homeland, but also protecting the West from further Russian advances.

[Even in the best-case scenario, Ukrainians may have to sacrifice
significant portions of their land]{.underline}. Europe hasn't been this
vulnerable to a leader's expansionist ambitions since the Second World
War.

[This is an enormous tragedy, playing out]{.underline} in slow motion --
not just for Ukraine, but **[for the entire rules-based international
order]{.underline}**.

#### Trump is threatening Ukraine and making concessions to Russia just to get them to the table

Russia-Ukraine negotiations" European Council on Foreign Relations, 4/3,
<https://ecfr.eu/article/the-art-of-the-peace-deal-what-the-trump-administration-wants-from-the-russia-ukraine-negotiations/>
//DH

Beyond the aura of peace, [the administration has another goal in mind
for these talks.]{.underline} In their first meeting with the Russians
in Riyadh in February, US secretary of state Marco [Rubio
and]{.underline} national security advisor Mike [Waltz began laying the
groundwork for a larger geopolitical deal that would go beyond the war
in Ukraine.]{.underline} The [Trump]{.underline} administration [seems
to want to trade Ukraine---]{.underline}and even the US role in European
security---[for Russian cooperation on]{.underline} a variety of
[extra-European issues, including Arctic resources, nuclear weapons
negotiations, Iran, North Korea and Syria.]{.underline} Some in the
administration even dream of the fabled "reverse Kissinger" in which a
new US relationship with Russia could eventually drive a wedge between
Russia and China.

This potential future relationship with Russia is an additional factor
in Trump's desire to end the war quickly. There is a faction within
Trump's political base who view Russia not just as a geopolitical
partner, but as a culturally conservative ally that serves as a bastion
of anti-woke, "Christian" values. This domestic ideological influence
helps explain the administration's herculean efforts to blame Ukraine
for starting this war and the reluctance to hold Russia or Putin
accountable for their crimes.

The new generation in the room

Unlike in the first term, the people in Trump's administration are
unlikely to moderate his views on either Ukraine or European security.
On the contrary, a new generation of policymakers surrounding the vice
president, J.D. Vance, and the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth,
believe in urgently shifting resources away from Ukraine and Europe to
Asia---or back to the Western hemisphere. They argue that America is not
ready for a war with China, has a massive security problem on its own
southern border, and cannot continue shouldering the burden of Europe's
defence, let alone Ukraine's.

The US government will likely withdraw some of its troops from Europe
and ship away weapons systems or offload them to allies. There is even
appetite to hand over the role of NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe
to Europeans. To deter China from invading Taiwan or even just push back
on China's ambitions, the US would need to shift key assets to the Asian
theatre: submarines; air and missile defences; heavy bombers; fighter,
patrol, and early warning aircraft; certain ground-based long-range
fires; and critical munitions for air, naval, and ground platforms. It
will also need critical enablers, such as airlift, sealift, and
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. The administration
seems even ready to "assume risk on other theatres" for the overall goal
of reorienting these assets to Asia.

A new emphasis on defending the southern US border and talk of military
intervention against cartels in Mexico may create separate demands on
the US army. It may need to provide forces for broad-area surveillance,
direct action against high-value targets, and even armoured vehicles
such as Strykers for more sustained incursions. These forces and
equipment would likely come from Europe, perhaps including the light
infantry deployed to Romania.

Sticks for Ukraine, carrots for Russia

Ultimately, [the tactics used]{.underline} by the Trump administration
towards the Ukrainians and the Russians---in essence, [sticks for
Ukraine and carrots for Russia---clearly illustrate the preference given
to]{.underline} ending the war and [offering a reset to Russia. In the
week after the public argument between]{.underline} Ukrainian president
Volodymyr [Zelensky and Trump]{.underline} in February, [the US paused
all shipments of military aid and halted intelligence sharing with
Ukraine.]{.underline} This retaliatory move, motivated by Zelensky's
supposed ingratitude, had immediate negative consequences for Ukraine on
the battlefield. [This stick drove the Ukrainians to the
table.]{.underline} To regain US assistance, the Ukrainian government
not only verbally agreed to a mercenary critical mineral deal but also
announced its acceptance of a 30-day ceasefire.

Following Ukraine's concession, the Americans are working on bringing
Russia to the table, but the method for exercising leverage appears
totally different than with the Ukrainians. Trump increased the
rhetorical pressure on Russia, saying "if Russia and I are unable to
make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was
Russia's fault---which it might not be---but if I think it was Russia's
fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out
of Russia". However, the Trump administration has shown little
willingness to actually coerce Russia into negotiations. Worse still,
the most salient threat---increased military aid and support for
Ukraine---remains strikingly absent.

Instead, they have consistently chosen flattery. Trump himself often
uses positive language when discussing Russia's participation in the
war, suggesting it "may be easier dealing with Russia" than Ukraine and
repeatedly stating his belief that Vladimir Putin wants peace. Even the
administration's lead negotiator, US special envoy Steve Witkoff, told
political commentator Tucker Carlson, "I don't regard Putin as a bad
guy." Trump's conciliatory tone implies he prefers to entice Putin to
the table with the carrot instead of the stick.

[The US kneecapped Ukraine's military and intelligence capabilities to
bring them to the table but offered Russia sanctions relief and economic
incentives in exchange for a temporary ceasefire]{.underline}. It
remains to be seen whether the carrot approach will work with Russia;
regardless, it says a lot about what the US is trying to achieve.
America is not looking to make the world safe for democracy, protect
Ukrainian sovereignty or seek a new transatlantic balance in providing
for European security. It is pursuing an aura of peace and a new deal
with Russia.

Maintain limited and structured engagement with Russia in the Arctic
Council

[[Despite the]{.underline}]{.mark} rupture in relations following

to preserve a functional channel of communication with Russia through
the council]{.underline}]{.mark} [to help prevent its

### 1ar -- Polar Council turn

#### The turn [ends the Arctic Council]{.underline} and the liberal world order. Failure to engage Russia causes widespread defections from BRICS and the establishment of [alternate]{.underline} Arctic institutions

[In 2022, the West]{.underline} again [led the dismantling of
cooperation]{.underline}. On 3 and 4 March 2022, Western countries
suspended interaction with Russia [in the Arctic Council]{.underline}
(USDS, 2022) and BEAC (BEAC, 2022). Russia tried to carry on its duties
as chair of the Arctic Council (Zhuravel and Timoshenko, 2023) and
officially withdrew from the BEAC only when Finland refused to transfer
chairmanship to Moscow as scheduled.

[Russia was not interested in reforming Arctic institutions because,
until 2022, it held an important position in them]{.underline}. This
reflected the reality that half of Arctic land, and half of the Arctic's
population, are Russian. Regardless of the state of Russia's economy or
international politics, **[Russia's role in the Arctic is
key]{.underline}**.

The Arctic generates approximately 10% of Russian GDP, 20% of Russian
exports (Karaganov, 2021), 80% of Russian gas, and 90% of Russian nickel
and cobalt, as well as other resources of key significance for the
Russian and global economies (Likhacheva and Stepanov, 2021). The
enormous importance of the Arctic for Russia made it a prime target for
the West: it seized the opportunity to "punish" Russia for revisionist
behavior, seeking to uphold the international status quo at the expense
of the Arctic status quo.

Timo Koivurova and Akiho Shibata (2023) note that binding-treaty-based
Arctic institutions have proven more stable than soft-law-based regimes.
The reason is that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which
relates only to the first group of regimes, permits the termination of
an international agreement with regard to one of its parties only if
such party has violated some provisions of the agreement. Russia did not
violate any Arctic norms, for which reason the Western countries had no
formal grounds to terminate interaction with it within these
institutions.

At the same time, the Arctic Council and BEAC based on 'soft law' turned
out to be seriously deformed by the Western countries' actions. For
example, Western countries decided to suspend cooperation with Russia in
the Arctic Council and the BEAC. Although some activities within the
Arctic Council resumed in 2023-2024, seven Western countries refused to
resume full cooperation (Arctic Council, 2023). And even before Russia
left the BEAC, Western officials had started speaking about a
renaissance of cooperation within the BEAC framework without Russia
(Edvardsen, 2023).

Koivurova and Shibata examine the reasons for the stability of some
regimes and the vulnerability of others, proceeding from purely legal
considerations and emphasizing the importance of the Vienna Convention
for international treaties. In our view, the Western Arctic countries
opted to leave some key regimes intact in order to preserve the general
system of international relations.

Western dismantling of Arctic cooperation has created two
contradictions.

Firstly, Western countries already have numerous channels for
cooperation amongst themselves, outside [the Arctic Council]{.underline}
and the BEAC; those institutions [were designed]{.underline}
specifically [for dialogue with Russia, and]{.underline} are thus
**[rendered pointless if Russia is squeezed out]{.underline}** of them.

Secondly, [by dismantling the Arctic order in defense of the liberal
world order, the West has actually only accelerated the collapse of the
latter]{.underline}.

The South: Keeping a Low Profile

Historically, the Arctic countries formed a club with exclusive right to
govern the region, based on two factors:

Firstly, the specific history of the Arctic's exploration and
development have formed a special attitude towards it among the peoples
and leaders of the Arctic countries. Unlike outer space, Antarctica, or
the world's oceans, the Arctic and the North have become an important
part of the cultures, national identities, and national myths of Russia,
Canada, and the Nordic countries.

Secondly, the Arctic has an extremely vulnerable and fragile ecosystem,
and any man-made environmental disasters could take a heavy toll on the
local population and nature. As a result, the Arctic countries were
skeptical of outsiders unaware of the complexity of local problems.

Club-type institutions, such as the Arctic Council, the BEAC or the
Arctic Five, did not endow their members with any special status, they
have made the international community view them as indisputable
"masters" of the region, and non-Arctic countries could hope only for
observer status. Granting such a status required members' consensus, and
before 2014, the Arctic countries might even align with one another
rather than with members of their own blocs. For example, Canada once
joined Russia in opposing observer status for the EU (Kirgizov-Barsky,
2021).

The first steps to engage non-Arctic countries in regional affairs were
taken long before 2022, but not at the governmental level. For example,
Russian and Chinese companies began mining minerals together in the
Russian Arctic in 2013 (Leksyutina and Zhou, 2022), and Russian
universities and research centers cooperate with scientists and experts
from China and other non-Arctic countries (Gutenev et al., 2023a;
Gutenev et al., 2023b).

However, in 2022, the Arctic powers could no longer stand together, and
the bloc solidarity of Western countries began to outweigh their purely
Arctic interests. The Arctic club collapsed, seeming to create favorable
conditions for extra-regional countries interested in enlarging their
role in the Arctic.

Yet there is no sign of their increased activity in the region's
institutions, as those institutions' legitimacy and usefulness have
collapsed due to Russia's exclusion. For example, in the fall of 2022,
amidst discussions of unilaterally transferring chairmanship of the
Arctic Council to Norway, China warned it would not recognize the
institution if Russia were excluded from it (The High North News, 2022).

Moreover, [the East and South, increasingly dissatisfied with the West's
liberal world order]{.underline}, which does not permit them to realize
their development goals, [are]{.underline} themselves [becoming
**increasingly revisionist** and]{.underline} thus **[aligned with
Russia]{.underline}**.

[Global dynamics are drawing]{.underline} leading BRICS
members---Russia, India, and China---[together, making them natural
partners in the Arctic]{.underline}. These countries seek to strengthen
their positions in the region and have a similar vision of global
processes. The events of the last few years and the countries' current
plans with regard to the Arctic confirm this assumption. Specifically,
BRICS countries are planning to open a joint scientific center in
Svalbard (Interfax, 2024); Russia and China are strengthening
cooperation in sea management (RIA Novosti, 2023); Russia and India are
strengthening cooperation on the Northern Sea Route (Korabel, 2023;
Arguments and Facts, 2023). Russia's 2023 Foreign Policy Concept calls
for cooperation in the Arctic with friendly extra-regional countries.
Nevertheless, China and India are not motivated by an anti-Western
ideology and remain open to cooperation with the West when it is in
their national interests. Both China and India remain present at major
Western expert conferences on the Arctic, such as the Arctic Circle
Forums (Pedersen and Steinveg, 2024); in 2023, India and the U.S. held
joint military exercises in Alaska (Bye, 2023).

[The second pillar of Russia's Arctic foreign policy is its creation of
alternative international cooperation platforms]{.underline}---notably
[with BRICS+ countries--- aimed at pressuring the West into restoring
Russia's participation in existing Arctic institutions]{.underline},
according to two Russian official respondents.\[7\]

Russia's chairship of the Arctic Council, which began in 2021 with high
hopes, came to an abrupt halt after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
In 2022, the seven Western member states suspended cooperation with
Russia over which Moscow has expressed repeated frustration.
Nonetheless, in 2023, Russia peacefully handed the chairship over to
Norway, which resumed minimal, technical-level engagement with Moscow.
In early 2024, however[, [Russia suspended its financial contributions
to the Arctic Council and hinted at a possible withdrawal, if the
council "become an unfriendly structure",]{.mark}]{.underline} referring
to Moscow's list of "unfriendly states".

[According to several Russian officials interviewed]{.underline} for
this brief, [[such gestures stemmed from internal
discussions]{.underline}]{.mark} starting in 2022 [[about forming an
alternative international Arctic institution **led by the
Kremlin**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[8\] In April 2023, state-affiliated
think-tanks started publicly promoting this idea, which was also
non-publicly discussed in government bodies, including the ministry of
emergency situations and the presidential administration. [The proposed
format involved announcing]{.underline}, during the 2024 BRICS+ summit
in Kazan, a "group for closer cooperation" on Arctic climate, resource
and scientific issues, which could eventually evolve into [[a "Polar
Council]{.underline}"]{.mark} with formal membership.

The term "[polar" [was]{.mark}]{.underline} deliberately [[chosen to
broaden the scope beyond the Arctic to include the Antarctic. This
allowed Russia to pitch participation to countries like Brazil and South
Africa, in addition to China and India]{.underline},]{.mark} while
avoiding direct competition and deflecting procedural challenges from
the Arctic Council.

Despite Moscow's public emphasis on BRICS+ interest in Arctic
cooperation between 2023 and 2024, neither the Polar Council nor the
smaller coordination group appeared in the final outcome documents of
the Kazan summit. The final declaration made no mention of the Arctic
and the newly established platforms on climate issues were framed in the
most neutral terms possible. The only initiative that continued to
develop was the "BRICS+ Working Group on Cooperation in the Oceanic and
Polar Research Zones", which had been created prior to 2022.

[One Russian official interviewed for this brief attributed the lack of
progress to a "refusal" of support from the Russian ministry of foreign
affairs]{.underline}.\[9\] According to him, [ministry officials feared
that the announcement of a new institution "could trigger a broader
unravelling of key Arctic cooperation frameworks]{.underline}". Another
respondent, Andrey Todorov, formerly of the ministry's legal department,
explained\[10\] that Russia benefits from multilateral agreements
brokered within the Arctic Council, including the 2011 search-and-rescue
accord and the 2013 agreement on oil-spill response. These frameworks,
he noted, Russia would really hate to lose.

For now, [[the Kremlin appears to have shelved the "Potemkin-style" idea
of a new Polar Council]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Instead, [it is using
symbolic acts of disengagement]{.mark}---such as withholding dues and
threatening to withdraw from the Arctic Council---[as leverage]{.mark},
while publicly exaggerating its bilateral Arctic cooperation with BRICS+
states]{.underline}. But [[if this strategy proves insufficient to
pressure Western actors into re-engagement, a new Polar Council may well
return]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially as some Russian actors remain
keen.

[Global dynamics are drawing leading BRICS

natural partners in the Arctic]{.underline}. These countries seek to
strengthen their positions in the region and have a similar vision of
global processes. The events of the last few years and the countries'

Sea Route]{.underline} (Korabel, 2023; Arguments and Facts, 2023).
Russia's 2023 Foreign Policy Concept calls for cooperation in the Arctic
with friendly extra-regional countries. Nevertheless, China and India
are not motivated by an anti-Western ideology and remain open to
cooperation with the West when it is in their national interests. Both
China and India remain present at major Western expert conferences on
the Arctic, such as the Arctic Circle Forums (Pedersen and Steinveg,
2024); in 2023, India and the U.S. held joint military exercises in
Alaska (Bye, 2023).

Thus, [amid the Ukraine crisis, the leading countries of the East and
the South eschew participation in Russia-excluding Arctic institutions,
and are increasing their own cooperation with Russia in the
region]{.underline}, while also maintaining cooperation with the West.

#### Russia is promoting scientific cooperation through BRICs

While the annexation of Crimea and the pandemic had already had an
impact on scientific cooperation in the Arctic, Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine represented an unprecedented geopolitical situation
since the Cold War. As Konyshev (2023) describes, [February 2022 marked
"a spillover effect of enmity in the Arctic",]{.underline} which
resulted in extraordinary reactions from most of the regional
organizations responsible for ensuring scientific cooperation. In March
2022, [the Arctic Council]{.underline}, which had been scheduled to be
chaired by the Russian Federation from 2021 to 2023, [suspended its
activities]{.underline} by decision of the seven other Arctic countries.
The Council's projects started to progressively resume under the
Norwegian chairship, but Russia remains excluded. At the level of
academic and scientific organizations, the University of the Arctic
(Uarctic) suspended its exchanges with its Russian counterparts, while
the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) scaled back its
projects with Russia[. In response, Russia is promoting the BRICS
alliance as an alternative means of fostering scientific cooperation in
the polar region]{.underline}. [The current institutional crisis between
Western Arctic states and Russia creates opportunities for the
non-Arctic states to assume a more prominent role in the region,
particularly countries belonging to the BRICS, such as
China]{.underline}, which is heavily involved in the Arctic Council
(Argüello and Rafaly, 2023).

### 2ac -- plan solves Russia

#### Science diplomacy solves the impact -- it builds trust and is a form of pressure on Russia - empirically

Luk Van **Langenhove** et al, 20**22** - is a Professor at the Brussels
School of Governance of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Professorial

//DH

[Breaking ties with all Russian scientists]{.underline} also [overlooks
the role of science diplomacy in resolving conflicts]{.underline}. Some
countries, like Slovenia, have said they would "suspend \[scientific\]
cooperation until a peace agreement in Ukraine is achieved". Given the
increasing geopolitical bifurcation, even prior to the start of the war,
there is no guaranteed Russian appetite for scientific cooperation with
the West once peace is achieved.

Nevertheless, [maintaining certain forms of scientific cooperation with
Russia throughout this war could provide a channel for eventual
reconciliation]{.underline}. Remember how, [at the height of the Cold
War, American and Soviet scientists worked together]{.underline} in
fields like space exploration, vaccine development, and nuclear fusion,
**[which helped set the mood for détente]{.underline}**. Similarly, [US
and Cuban meteorologists were integral in normalizing relations between
their countries in 2014, thanks to their longstanding
collaboration]{.underline} amidst a cold political climate. Thus,
[severing ties with Russia's scientific community may destroy a channel
that could one day aid the peace process]{.underline}, especially if
embassies continue to downsize diplomatic staff and former president
Medvedev's comments about the pointlessness of traditional diplomatic
relations with the West come to fruition.

As Russian bombs and rockets continue to wreak havoc on Ukrainian
cities, the need to keep scientific relations alive may seem a very low
priority. However, traditional diplomatic channels remain open in the
interest of finding a solution. If science diplomacy is the pursuit of
foreign-policy objectives through science, then scientific channels
should also remain as open as possible, in pursuit of mutual trust and
understanding that will be vital once the war comes to an end.

The Scientists Themselves

Russian scientists are overwhelmingly horrified by the monstrous actions
undertaken by their government, as can be seen in a letter condemning
the war which, at the time of this writing, was signed by nearly 8,000
individuals in the Russian scientific community. Russian cosmonauts
onboard the International Space Station dressed in the blue and yellow
of the Ukrainian flag, in symbolic defiance. These scientists act in
great peril to themselves, in light of the Duma's law threatening up to
15 years in jail for those who refute the Kremlin's "special military
operation" propaganda. Cutting ties with these scientists thus leaves
them in the cold, at the mercy of a regime that seems increasingly bent
on crushing the freedom of inquiry that underpins their work.

For that reason, cooperation should continue as much as possible as a
sign of solidarity, as long as it does not jeopardize the safety of the
scientists or assist the Kremlin's objectives. This sentiment has been
echoed by many voices in the Western academic community, as seen in a
letter from US and Canadian researchers, urging their governments to
resist "shunning all Russian scientists for the actions of the Russian
government". They argue that doing so "would be a serious setback to a
variety of Western and global interests and values". Indeed, cutting
Russian researchers out of the global science community completely,
because they reside in a country ruled by a despicable dictator,
disregards the Enlightenment principals of progress and toleration upon
which Western societies are based.

There is also the question of the goal of Western sanctions. [Sanctions
seek to apply pressure on Putin]{.underline} and his siloviki, in hopes
that they cease this horrendous war. The Russian public, which includes
[the scientific community, is one channel through which to
deliver]{.underline} the intended [pressure]{.underline}. However, the
Kremlin has viciously cracked down on instances of public dissent,
crippling the public's effectiveness in applying pressure on its
government. Arguably, those opposed to the war do not feel emboldened to
risk humiliation, beatings, arrest, and 15 years in prison---especially
in the absence of Western support for the pressure they could apply.
[Retaining bridges with the Russians who stand against their government
helps to maintain an effective channel for exerting anti-war
pressure.]{.underline}

The situation of Russian scientists should be closely monitored. If it
becomes impossible for these scientists to conduct collaborative work,
the West should open its doors to them. The noble initiative by the
European Research Council (ERC) to provide jobs for Ukrainian
researchers fleeing the war could be emulated for Russian researchers
facing persecution for their Western ties. Although an extreme example,
we should remember the lessons from Operation Paperclip, the secret
operation that relocated scientists living under the Third Reich to
America.

Conclusions

War is an extremely polarizing phenomenon that divides nuances into
black and white. As Russian forces rolled into Ukraine, the Western
response was to shut Russia out of virtually all partnerships and areas
of cooperation. It seemed a justified reaction to a country seeking to
reintroduce war into Europe after decades of peace. But, as inexcusable
as the actions of the Putin regime are, we risk being blind to the
nuances of the situation as we respond. It is difficult to employ
rationality in times of war, when emotion takes the driver's seat, but
it is nonetheless crucial to ask the following questions in assessing
our response: [Do these actions stifle the Kremlin's war objectives? Do
they help Ukraine?]{.underline} What is the impact on humanity at large?
[Cutting ties with the Russian scientific community, when
the]{.underline} respective [answers to those questions are
"no]{.underline}", "no", and "negative", [makes one think that
scientific cooperation is just another victim]{.underline} of a
pointless war.

A true science diplomacy approach to the situation in Ukraine and Russia
is well illustrated by the statement issued by the Association of Polar
Early Career Scientists (APECS). This organization expresses strong
support of Ukraine and condemns Russia's invasion. The statement also
stresses that both countries are important contributors to polar
research and that APECS will do everything in its power to "limit the
isolation of polar early career researchers behind political borders,
and encourage the continued participation of our Russian members, who
may feel trapped in a situation imposed upon them". That is indeed the
way forward: we must realize that we live in the Anthropocene, and that
[humanity faces severe global crises that require]{.underline}
scientific knowledge and [international collaboration. Polar research is
one of these areas]{.underline}. The current challenge for science
diplomacy is to ensure that even warring countries keep working together
on common threats. This can be done by supporting international
cooperation at an individual level, and by ensuring support in the
post-war period, to strengthen cooperation. The bonus is that
[scientific cooperation, even between states in conflict, can contribute
to the development of mutual trust]{.underline}. After all, whatever the
reasons for war, the reality is that all the world's states face common
problems. It is urgent that we mobilize scientists from all over the
planet to combat climate change, for example.

#### Science diplomacy reduces misperception and [appeasement]{.underline}, causes stronger negotiations and better decision-making

Science diplomacy, perception and misperception in international
politics

Robert Jervis defined much of the political psychology research agenda
in international politics in his classic 1976 book, Perception and
Misperception in International Politics ( Jervis, 1976). [Jervis
discusses two possible disastrous misperceptions in international
politics: overreacting to an enemy]{.underline} with the outbreak of
World War I as example, [or]{.underline} not reacting sufficiently to an
enemy, where pre-World War II **[appeasement]{.underline}** of
Nazi-Germany is the example forming an overly influential analogy.

Broadly speaking, [science diplomacy]{.underline} in its main practices
[should]{.underline} be expected to **[mitigate these
dangers]{.underline}**. [More science diplomacy]{.underline} in all
three practices discussed here [should familiarize states and their
foreign policy-makers with their counterparts making for **more accurate
perception and judgment**]{.underline}. Especially "science FOR
diplomacy" with dense transnational epistemic communities between
potential enemies should make for improved decision-making. However, key
political psychology concepts caution against unfounded optimism.

Science diplomacy, learning and socialization

The standard neo-classical assumption in social science is rational
decision-makers with Bayesian updating of perceptions in view of new
information contradicting previous beliefs. However, research shows this
assumption to be unfounded, and individuals' perceptions are
disproportionately shaped by previous learning and socialization ( Levy,
2013). Science diplomacy can affect such previous learning and
socialization and therefore later perception and judgment.

There is a long foreign policy tradition of using education of other
societies' elites as a strategic tool. [Education of foreign
decision-makers can be a way to **influence their
worldviews**]{.underline}, [or it can]{.underline} simply be a way to
**[build access and networks]{.underline}**. Missionary education
illustrates this approach, and state support shows how it has been and
remains a foreign policy instrument. Most recently the soft power
thinking post-9/11 in War on Terror and US support for American-style
higher education in the Middle East reflected such thinking.

"[Science FOR diplomacy]{.underline}" with transnational epistemic
communities **[socializes and shapes participants' views]{.underline}**.
These views may well be unruly and frustrating for national foreign
policy systems and funders; for instance, members of US Congress have
been frustrated about overt anti-US and anti-Israel views among students
at American universities in the Middle East receiving US federal support
( Newsweek, 1970). However, the ability to socialize and shape and
direct worldviews is likely to be a long-term function of material and
intellectual resources, where the US and the West in general is at
significant advance.

A homogenous group socialized into a certain perspective is likely to be
biased and overly shaped by previous experiences, which points to the
foreign-policy decision-making pitfall of groupthink.

Science diplomacy to counter groupthink

Another social psychology term of relevance for science diplomacy is
groupthink, the tendency of poor analysis in too homogenous groups
because of lacking diversity of perspectives and dissenting views with
potential disastrous foreign policy outcomes ( Janis, 1972). "[Science
FOR diplomacy" can]{.underline} probably **[mitigate
groupthink]{.underline}** [by bringing together academics from divergent
backgrounds and views.]{.underline} Intellectual boycotts and sanctions
of a political opponent, as is seen currently concerning Russia over its
invasion of Ukraine, risks increasing groupthink on both sides with
poorer analysis and decision-making. The US 2001 invasion of Afghanistan
or 2003 invasion of Iraq, both failing to achieve their objectives,
illustrate the perils of discouraging dissent and basing policy on
invalid analysis and assumptions.

There is no doubt that the war in [Ukraine has made cooperation and
diplomacy in the Arctic more difficult. However, the U.S. can expect
Russia to remain open to peaceful discussions. Even at the height of the
Cold War, the Soviet Union cooperated with the West on Arctic issues,
including]{.underline} initiatives such as [the]{.underline} 1973
[Convention on]{.underline} the Conservation of [Polar
Bears]{.underline} \[28\] [and the]{.underline} 1987 [Murmansk
Initiative]{.underline} toward regional cooperation, recognizing the
special responsibilities and special interests of the States of the
Arctic Region in relation to the protection of the fauna and flora of
the Arctic Region and recognizing that the polar bear is a significant
resource of the Arctic Region that requires additional protection.

//DH

[Breaking ties with]{.underline} all [Russian scientists also overlooks
the role of science diplomacy in resolving conflicts]{.underline}. As
Olšáková and Robinson put it, maintaining certain forms of scientific
cooperation with Russia throughout this war might at first seem like a
naïve historical reading of science diplomacy mythologised during the
Cold War, when American and Soviet scientists helped set the mood for
détente by working together in fields like space exploration,
demographics, vaccine development, and nuclear fusion. Today, however,
science diplomacy illustrates the global nature of science and
technological progress in our highly interdependent world. Scientific
progress cannot afford to be nationalistic when cross-border
collaboration is needed to face global challenges. These challenges need
the input of all scientists.

If science diplomacy is the pursuit of foreign-policy objectives through
science, then the [open scientific channels]{.underline} developed over
the last few decades should be cherished and kept as open as possible.
Such channels [should be used to pursue mutual trust]{.underline} and
understanding among scientists [as an antidote for]{.underline}, as
Sergey Guriev and Daniel Treisman put it, the new generation of "[**spin
dictators**", like]{.underline} [Vladimir Putin, who will use
information to control citizens]{.underline}. "Like spin doctors in
democracies, [they spin the news to engineer support." Scientists will
rarely fall for such distorted information. Cutting ties is the wrong
policy: it leaves scientists in the cold, at the mercy of a
regime]{.underline} that is bent on crushing the freedom of inquiry that
underpins their work.

For these reasons, cooperation should continue as much as possible, as
long as it does not jeopardize the safety of Russian scientists or
assist the Kremlin's objectives. This sentiment has been echoed by many
voices in the western academic community, as seen in a letter from US
and Canadian researchers, urging their governments to resist "shunning
all Russian scientists for the actions of the Russian government".
Cutting Russian researchers out of the global science community because
they reside in a country ruled by a despicable dictator disregards the
Enlightenment principals of progress and toleration upon which western
societies are based.

### 2ac -- Ukraine impact defense

#### No impact -- the war will be contained, other countries won't model and expand wars

John **Mueller, 22** - Professor Emeritus at Ohio State University "The
Upside of Putin's Delusions: Moscow's Disastrous Invasion of Ukraine
Will Reinforce the Norm Against War" 8/2, Foreign Affairs,

//DH

But [five months into]{.underline} the current phase of the war in
[[Ukraine]{.mark}, it seems]{.underline} more [likely]{.underline} that
Putin's venture [[will]{.mark}]{.underline} reinforce and [[revitalize
the aversion to]{.underline}]{.mark} and disdain for [[international
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. The key objective is not so much about winning
as making sure that the country that started the war is far worse off
than if it had not done so. That has already been substantially
achieved.

GLOBAL CONDEMNATION

[[The world]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[responded]{.mark} to Putin's
invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine [[with]{.mark} nearly [universal
revulsion]{.mark}]{.underline}, much as it responded to Saddam Hussein's
seizure of Kuwait in 1990: as Fazal notes, "the outrage has been swift
and broad." Although some policymakers have expressed concern that China
might find inspiration for an invasion of Taiwan, there doesn't seem to
be a groundswell of prospective imitators. [[Any would-be aggressors
cannot help but notice the high costs the war has imposed on Russia in
terms of casualties, economic losses, and international
isolation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The kleptocratic Russian economy had
already been on the skids for most of a decade, and Putin's war, even if
it is somehow settled, will likely alienate prospective buyers and
investors for at least as long as he is in charge---and probably a lot
longer.

[[Would-be aggressors may]{.mark} also [note that even if Putin can hang
on to]{.mark} his [territorial gains]{.mark} in Ukraine, [he will have
to rebuild]{.mark}, subsidize, [and]{.mark} rule them.]{.underline} In
areas that Russian forces have occupied since the war began, they have
struggled to govern: the Russians, it seems, are not very good at
occupation and civil administration, and Russian forces seem inclined to
commit the kinds of brutal acts that increase hostility toward foreign
occupiers.

Without a durable and reliable cease-fire, Russia will have to defend
its new acquisitions, possibly for years or decades. Putin has
repeatedly expressed outrage that Ukrainian forces have for seven years
harassed and bombed the small Donbas enclaves that seceded from Ukraine
in 2014 and then embraced Russian protection. The lands Russian now
seeks to conquer and control---including the entire provinces of Luhansk
and Donetsk---would present an even richer target for increasingly
better armed and much more intensely hostile Ukrainian forces. [There is
also the prospect of having to [defend]{.mark} the newly captured areas
[against years of partisan urban warfare]{.mark} from Ukrainian
insurgents]{.underline}. To a degree, this has already started. For
example, a Ukrainian man whom Russian forces had appointed as the new
head of the Department of Youth and Sports in the city of Kherson was
recently killed in a car bombing.

DELUDED HUBRIS

In his speech announcing the invasion, Putin stressed that "Russia
cannot feel safe, develop, and exist while facing a permanent threat
from the territory of today's Ukraine," which he analogized to the one
presented by Nazi Germany before World War II. He argued that a showdown
was inevitable, claiming even that Ukraine was seeking to acquire
nuclear weapons.

Putin is scarcely unique among world leaders in allowing himself to be
consumed by such delusions. U.S. Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill
Clinton absurdly insisted that a coup in Haiti presented "an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States," and their predecessors, U.S. Presidents
Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson believed that a U.S. failure to
intervene in civil wars in Korea and Vietnam would lead to world war.
But [Russia's war]{.underline} against Ukraine has backfired and [proved
to be counterproductive in ways that will likely give pause to any
would-be imitators]{.underline}.

Putin noted in his war kickoff speech that "with NATO's eastward
expansion, the situation for Russia has been becoming worse and more
dangerous by the year." Whether his war was to push NATO away from
Russia's borders, to create disunity within the alliance, to provide a
stepping stone for further advances, or somehow to enhance Russia's
status (except as a pariah), it has been a massive failure. It has even
inspired Russia's long-neutral neighbors, Sweden and Finland, to seek
admission. Thus, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} enlargement has scarcely
been stopped. The alliance [[has become far more hostile, united, and
better armed]{.mark}, and it has effectively moved closer]{.underline}.

Putin's war has also failed at another of his pronounced goals: keeping
Ukraine from embracing the West and moving toward joining the European
Union and NATO. But his efforts over the last decade have driven
Ukrainians to look more to the West. In December 2012, according to a
poll conducted by the Kyiv-based Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a
scant 15 percent of Ukrainians favored joining NATO. By January 2022, on
the eve of war, that figure had risen to 64 percent, according to a
survey conducted by the Ukrainian Institute of the Future. It has surely
risen far higher since the invasion. In addition, under the impetus of
the war, Ukraine has now been allowed to enter the formal process of
joining the EU. And it is possible that the war, by enhancing Kyiv's
desperation to be admitted, might even cause it to finally deal with its
endemic corruption problem, which had previously hampered its embrace by
the West.

Putin has also said his goal in the war was "to demilitarize and
de-Nazify Ukraine." Demilitarization has obviously failed as arms pour
into the country. And if de-Nazification means establishing a compliant
regime, projecting a sphere of influence, or, as some suggest,
destroying democracy in Ukraine, the Russian failure has been total.
Hatred for, and hostility toward, Russia may well last for decades.

Putin has also declared that he wanted to rescue and protect Russian
speakers in Ukraine. "It's essentially impossible," one insider told
Newsweek, "to convince the people around power in Moscow that Russian
speakers in Ukraine are not being discriminated against" and that
"people can have a national identity that is separate from their
linguistic identity." Some Russian speakers in Ukraine have welcomed the
Russian invasion. But the overwhelming majority have taken Ukraine's
side---something the government in Kyiv should be doing more to
celebrate. As such, Russian-speaking Ukrainians will continue to be
productive contributors to their country---although it is possible that
the use of Russian, the language of the hated invader, will continue to
slide as the country looks increasingly to the West.

During the crisis with Ukraine in 2014, Putin bragged that he had "1.2
million soldiers armed with the world's most sophisticated weaponry" and
that, if he wanted them to do so, "they could be in Kyiv in two days."
Over the ensuing years, he built up his army even more. If one goal of
the current war was to display the might and effectiveness of the
Russian military, the result could be chalked up as yet another failure.
Corrupt, poorly led, and undermotivated, the Russian military was
repelled from Kyiv by defenders with far less training and equipment.
Any Russian gains in Ukraine's southeast have been accomplished by
pulverizing the territory from a distance and then taking charge of the
substantially depopulated rubble.

For all these reasons, it seems unlikely that other countries will find
much inspiration in Putin's "self-inflicted debacle," as Steve Chapman
of the Chicago Tribune puts it. Putin admires the Russian leader Peter
the Great and apparently wishes to emulate a version of his imperial
rule. But Russia's current tsar will likely go down in history not as
Vladimir the Great but as Vladimir the Fool. And [his]{.underline}
failed and spectacularly [counterproductive war seems unlikely to augur
a new era of interstate war---rather, [his folly will likely make other
rulers even more **trigger shy**, and the decline of international war
will continue]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### AT: NATO-Russia war

#### Russia won't invade -- they are overwhelmingly disadvantaged

Anatol **Lieven, 22** - senior research fellow on Russia and Europe at
the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, formerly a professor at
Georgetown University in Qatar and in the War Studies Department of
King's College London "The real military balance between Russia and
NATO" 7/14,
<https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/07/14/the-real-military-balance-between-russia-and-nato/>

In terms of military spending, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and NATO are overwhelmingly superior to
Russia]{.underline}.]{.mark} [In 2021]{.underline}, [[Russia spent
around \$66 billion on its military]{.mark}. [NATO's European
members]{.mark} alone [spent]{.mark}]{.underline} more than [[four times
that]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[spent]{.mark} more than [eleven times
that]{.mark} much]{.underline} (\$801 billion), though of course it has
huge military commitments outside Europe. Moreover, European
governments, including Germany, have promised steep increases in
military spending, though the details are still far from clear.

[NATO's European fleets alone have almost four times the number of
Russia's surface warships]{.underline}, leaving aside the huge forces
deployed by the United States with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean
and the Second Fleet in the Atlantic. [The assertion in NATO's Strategic
Concept that Russia can pose a serious threat to NATO in the
Mediterranean appears unconvincing]{.underline}. [[Russia's
Mediterranean squadron]{.mark} usually [consists of only three frigates
and six]{.mark} Varshavyanka-class conventional
[submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The U.S. Sixth Fleet
alone]{.underline}]{.mark} [usually [has]{.mark} around [40
warships]{.mark}]{.underline}, including an aircraft carrier and
cruisers, backed not only by the other NATO navies, but also by their
air forces.

Russia's large submarine fleet is another matter. This poses the same
two threats to NATO as Soviet submarines once did. First, there is the
nuclear threat from Russia's 12 ballistic missile submarines and 10
cruise missile submarines. Second, there are Russia's 15 nuclear attack
submarines (five of which have been, until this year at least, deployed
to the Pacific) and 20 conventional attack submarines (six in the
Pacific).

Their chief purposes have been to help protect the deployment of
ballistic missile submarines and to attack NATO shipping across the
Atlantic in order to hinder U.S. reinforcements from reaching Europe in
the event of war. How effective they would actually be is not clear ---
the United States, Britain, and France together have at least 35 nuclear
attack submarines deployable in the Atlantic to protect convoys --- but
it is to be presumed that they could cause considerable damage.

But would U.S. reinforcements to Europe even be necessary to defeat a
Russian invasion of NATO? [[A Russian army which has had to fight for
months to capture relatively small cities in the Donbas hardly looks
capable of capturing Warsaw]{.underline}]{.mark}, let alone Berlin.
[Russia also cannot prevent the U.S. Air Force from crossing the
Atlantic]{.underline} to help repel an invasion.

[In terms of sheer numbers of troops and weapons, NATO's European
members plus the U.S. troops presently stationed in Europe have a
considerable edge]{.underline}. In 2021, the active ground forces (not
counting reserves) of [NATO's five main European members numbered more
than 500,000 troops, compared to Russia's 280,000]{.underline}; [and
most of the latter are currently pinned down in Ukraine]{.underline} (or
in tens of thousands of cases, dead or wounded). The United States has
six combat brigades stationed in Europe; far smaller than overall
Russian forces, but enough to seriously stiffen European resistance.

[On paper, Russia has 22,000 armored vehicles]{.underline} compared to
NATO's 16,000. [However, the evidence of the Ukraine war suggests that a
great many of these [Russian vehicles]{.mark} held in storage
[have]{.mark} in fact [deteriorated to the point that they cannot be
effectively deployed]{.mark}]{.underline}; [and Russia's remaining
superiority in armor over Ukraine has been largely nullified
by]{.underline} a combination of [Ukrainian courage and NATO anti-tank
weapons]{.underline}. The same has been true of Russia's even more
overwhelming superiority in the air when faced with U.S. anti-aircraft
missiles.

For the foreseeable future, [[a very large part of the Russian army will
be tied down]{.mark} fighting [in Ukraine]{.mark} or guarding against
Ukrainian counter-attacks]{.underline}. American and British
intelligence estimates suggest that [Russia has already lost around a
quarter of its effective fighting strength in Ukraine]{.underline}.
There is therefore no comparison between the threat posed by Russian
ground forces to NATO today with the days when huge Soviet tank armies
stood on the Elbe and the Danube.

As to NATO's European forces, the questions that hang over them are
those of both coordination and will. The desire of European countries to
preserve their own military industries has led to huge multiplication of
sometimes incompatible weapons systems, and separate militaries have
overlapping and contradictory command structures. [[NATO's promised
creation of a 300,000-strong joint rapid reaction
force]{.underline}]{.mark}, if it actually materializes,
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} help reduce the coordination problem and
certainly [be enough to [defeat any Russian attack on NATO]{.mark} as a
whole]{.underline}.

#### Their argument assumes Putin is deeply irrational

Anatol **Lieven, 22** - senior research fellow on Russia and Europe at
the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, formerly a professor at
Georgetown University in Qatar and in the War Studies Department of
King's College London "The real military balance between Russia and
NATO" 7/14,
<https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/07/14/the-real-military-balance-between-russia-and-nato/>

Poland would undoubtedly also come to the aid of the Baltic States if
they were attacked. [The Baltic]{.underline} --- even after the
accession of Sweden and Finland --- [is NATO's most vulnerable
point]{.underline}. Even given Russia's commitments in Ukraine, Russia
could concentrate very superior forces against the Balts, while, for
geographical reasons, NATO reinforcement would be challenging. In a
battle on the frontiers, the Balts would be overwhelmed.

[But]{.underline} then, [the Balts]{.underline} would not fight on the
frontiers. They [would]{.underline} almost certainly [retreat into the
cities]{.underline} of Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, and Kaunas [and fight it
out street by street as the Ukrainians have done, thereby denying Russia
a quick victory before larger NATO forces could intervene.]{.underline}

[A Russian invasion of the Baltic would]{.underline}, in any event, [be
a **deeply irrational act**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} purely
[military terms; and while Putin's invasion of Ukraine was]{.underline}
utterly [criminal, it was not insane]{.underline} --- after all, as
noted, [Moscow's assumptions of an easy short-term victory were shared
by Western intelligence]{.underline}. The one circumstance in which
Russia might feel compelled to invade Lithuania would be if Lithuania
were to blockade access to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad; which is
why the EU would be wise to follow Germany's lead exempting Kaliningrad
from EU sanctions.

# Counterplans

## Track 2

### 2ac -- Track 2

#### Perm do both -- it solves best

Beyond track 1 and track 2

Another opportunity to make progress in this conflicted space is to
consider the potential roles of different actors. Much academic
discussion has focused on track 1 diplomacy, or formal diplomacy,
suggesting that track 2, or informal, efforts were largely a spillover
from scientific cooperation. However, the reality has been more nuanced.
[[Sometimes projects **initiated by track 1 players** have been enacted
by track 2 actors]{.underline}]{.mark}. During the Obama era, for
example, [the US National Academy of Sciences played an active role in
mediating the intended rapprochement with Cuba]{.underline}.
[Conversely]{.underline}, [track 2 activities have led to significant
diplomatic achievements]{.underline}. The scientifically led
International Geophysical Year of 1957-58 resulted in the Antarctic
Treaty. [[Track 1 and 2 approaches are not separate, but increasingly
intertwined]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Inevitably, direct national interests will be primarily driven by the
political processes determining economic and security policy. Domestic
scientific communities strive to show their relevance to their national
funders by supporting such efforts. But at the same time, it has been
the global scientific community that has brought attention to climate
change, biodiversity loss, pandemic risks, and many other existential
threats which require concerted, collective action. In this narrowing
window of opportunities to make progress on critically important global
goals, track 2 science diplomacy may become even more necessary. For
example, the activities proposed for the 2032 International Polar Year,
which emphasizes involvement and coproduction of knowledge between a
range of Arctic stakeholders, could help to reduce diplomatic tensions
and build relationships.

A renewed emphasis on track 2, or [**[a hybrid approach utilizing both
tracks]{.underline}**, [would]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[be
returning to a role the international science community has often played
in history]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the eighteenth century, for example,
scientists worked across conflicted nations on issues of common
interest, such as gathering measurements of the transit of Venus from
multiple sites to estimate the solar unit. But in the current context of
rapid change in science when inter-nation tensions are high, track 2
efforts could be an important tool.

#### Can't solve science diplomacy -- reducing miscalc requires official participation

Security and Resilience, University of Alaska Fairbanks "Trump 2.0's

//DH

The Biden administration's 2022 National Security Strategy pledged to
restore American leadership on the global stage while tacitly
criticizing the previous Trump administration's self-interested and
transactional approach to world affairs. However, when it comes to
Russian relations, neither the first Trump nor Biden administrations did
anything to rescind Obama's Kremlin ban. [[Decreased dialogue between
Washington and Moscow]{.mark} only degrades diplomacy, [exacerbates
tension]{.mark}, and increases the unknowns.]{.underline} Since the
beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, [the global
situation]{.underline} has gone from bad to worse. [It has become
particularly troubling in the Arctic where [military and commercial
activities continue to increase in scope and scale and where there are
no functioning forums---**at the official level**---enabling Washington
and Moscow to **deescalate tensions**]{.mark}. Absent a structured forum
for deescalation, [the **risk for miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation and
escalation [increase]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The Arctic presents an opportunity for the Trump administration to
pursue pragmatic and more open engagement between Washington and
Moscow]{.underline}, specifically in the military and security space.
[Such [a forum currently exists at the Track 2 level, but **absent
official participation** from Washington and Moscow decision makers,
this forum's efforts to curtail conflict will
struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Can't solve scientific research - Track 2 won't spill into policy change because it doesn't fiat official action

Vaughan **Turekian and** Peter **Gluckman**, 20**24** -- \*executive
director of the National Academies\' Policy and Global Affairs Division

But even as countries have begun restricting scientific interchange, the
world faces common, global challenges that science and technology must
address. This obvious paradox points to weaknesses in the previous
conception of science diplomacy and explains why responses to global
issues such as climate change, sustainability, pandemics, and autonomous
weapons have been inadequate. [[When science diplomacy becomes
disconnected from]{.mark} critical [national
security]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic [[priorities, it can **no
longer influence policy**]{.mark}. One of the criticisms of [the Kyoto
Protocol]{.mark}]{.underline}, which required ratifying nations to set
individualized targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, [was that
it [used an international agreement to drive domestic policy]{.mark}.
Although the effort had some success in some countries, [it encountered
greater difficulty in the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[where the domestic political consensus
for climate]{.mark} action [had not been resolved]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Under such circumstances, [[one can build consensus internationally but
**fail to build it nationally**-and **national priorities inevitably
carry the day**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 1ar -- permutation

#### Track 2 still requires official government support through the National Science Foundation -- that's the [plan]{.underline}. Government action is still required to ensure visas

If these new signs of Russia's pivot to the East are alarming, then the
task is now to find the gaps in the current freeze and identify areas
where scientific cooperation, [track 2 diplomacy]{.underline} and other
forms of dialogue [are possible]{.underline} between the largest Arctic
state, Russia, and the seven other Arctic countries. Non-state actors,
such as researchers, will now play a particularly important role as
state-level cooperation is frozen. Academic conferences that bring
together researchers regardless of nationality to share insights based
on a common concern for the dramatic changes unfolding in the Arctic are
themselves examples of science and citizen diplomacy. [Recent examples
include **the USC-NSF** Conference]{.underline} on Strategic Ambition
and Environmental Constraint and the Calotte Academy14) [Though
government-level science may be restricted, cooperation at the
individual-level is still manageable but **laden with obstacles such as
visa restrictions** and **closed consulates**]{.underline}.

What specific areas are there for cooperation today? [Special attention
can be paid to the synergies that exist between the **National Science
Foundation**]{.underline}'s Navigating the New Arctic agenda [and the
Russian]{.underline} AC chairmanship [agenda]{.underline}. Both programs
mention knowledge coproduction with Indigenous peoples as well as
scientific and cultural exchanges with Indigenous knowledge holders.15)
Research communities should prioritize working with Indigenous knowledge
holders, not least because of their unique circumpolar organizations
that go beyond national borders and could be an avenue for scientific
cooperation at the international, people-to-people level.

#### Funding and approval make private science 'federal' 

Korey **Silverman-Roati &** Romany M. **Webb,** 20**24** - Sabin Center
for Climate Change Law. "Removing Methane via Soil Amendments: The Legal
Framework,"(2024). Available at:
https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/sabin_climate_change/238 //DH

As noted above, under NEPA, federal agencies are only required to
prepare an EIS for "major federal actions significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment." For the purposes of NEPA[, [federal
actions include "projects]{.mark}]{.underline} and programs [entirely or
[partly financed]{.mark}]{.underline}, assisted, conducted, regulated,
[[or]{.underline} [approved by Federal
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}."121 Thus, where a federal agency proposes
to undertake a soil amendment project, that would qualify as a "federal
action" under NEPA. Soil amendment [[projects]{.mark} proposed
[by]{.mark} non-federal actors (e.g., [private
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} or companies) might also [[qualify if
the projects are funded, approved]{.mark}, or otherwise regulated [by a
federal agency]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the latter case,
however, [[the project will]{.mark} only [be considered a federal
action]{.mark}]{.underline} under NEPA [[if]{.mark} it is "[subject to
Federal control]{.mark} and responsibility]{.underline}."122 As
discussed in Part 4.1.4 below, many privately developed soil amendment
projects will likely require federal permits and thus be subject to
federal control.

#### Plan applies to NSF funded projects -- it's not literally government diplomats

Pavel **Devyatkin,** 20**22** -- senior associate at the Arctic
Institute (Washington, DC) and a PhD fellow and lecturer at HSE
University (Moscow) "Environmental Détente: U.S.-Russia Arctic science
diplomacy through political tensions" The Polar Journal, v12, Taylor &
Francis database, accessed via University of Michigan //DH

**NSF = National Science Foundation, a US government agency**

[There are now fears that science diplomacy is dead in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The escalation of [the Ukraine
conflict]{.underline} in 2022 has [severely strained Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}. In March 2022, the other seven AC member
states condemned Russia and called for a pause of the Council's work
during Russia's chairmanship in March 2022. 101 AC Working and Expert
groups have been halted. Arctic scientists continue to work on research,
but 'there should be no exchange of data or official publishing,'
according to Norway's Senior Arctic Official Morten Høglund. 102 Many
other Arctic organisations, such as the IASC, likewise criticised Russia
and/or paused work. 103 Russia's Arctic officials called the suspension
'regrettable' and declared that it was important to preserve AC
activities, 'so that -- when circumstances allow -- cooperation can
continue without prejudice to those who depend on these projects.' 104
Russia has subsequently reoriented its chairmanship agenda towards a
domestic scope on the Russian North.

Meanwhile, John Kerry, serving as Biden's climate change envoy,
nevertheless expressed his hope that Putin would 'stay on track' in
combatting climate change.105 Still, high-level U.S.-Russia science
cooperation was further blunted after [[the White House announced a
termination of scientific cooperation with Russian government-affiliated
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. 106 [[The move]{.underline}]{.mark}
ostensibly [[suspends]{.mark} numerous **[NSF-funded
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} have [enabled
collaborations]{.mark} between U.S. and Russian scientists [such as
studies of]{.mark}]{.underline} Indigenous communities in Kamchatka,
Chukotka, and Alaska, the interaction of social and natural systems in
Yamal, and [[permafrost degradation across the Russian
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}107 It is now up to non-government
institutions and researchers to make their own decisions regarding
continued cooperation.

The situation is dismal as Russia's AC chairmanship and the Biden
administration share mutual interests in environmental protection and
climate change. For example, both countries are parties to the Agreement
to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean,
which commits the parties to establish a Joint Program of Scientific
Research and Monitoring to study the Arctic ecosystem. 108 [There
are]{.underline} still calls [from international Arctic scholars for
cooperation in such crucial spheres and to support the collective
benefit of a functioning AC]{.underline}. 109 Scientists who had
participated in MOSAiC said that tensions over the conflict cripple
Arctic research: ['If we limit access \[to the Russian Arctic\], we will
miss some important insights to better understand how and why the Arctic
system is changing]{.underline},' said Matthew Shupe, an atmospheric
scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. 110 In working towards
improving Arctic science diplomacy, it is important to remember these
challenges and conditions. Science diplomacy is essential for
maintaining scientific cooperation; when science diplomacy breaks down,
science cooperation deteriorates as well. In this case, science
diplomacy holds the key to reigniting scientific cooperation if Arctic
cooperation is ever fully resumed.

In conclusion, the historical legacies and modern examples of
U.S.-Russia collaborations demonstrate the value of Arctic science
cooperation and the importance of science diplomacy to realise such
initiatives. When tensions were reduced, science diplomacy as a process
produced beneficial outcomes, but it is also an important instrument to
maintain some relations even during aggravated international relations.
This is evidenced by the proliferation of scientific knowledge as well
as the opening of communication channels that builds confidence. On one
hand, cooperation can bridge inequalities in resources, capabilities,
experience, and knowledge between countries. On the other hand,
[scientific collaboration serves as a foundation for relationships
between nations and builds trust among involved actors]{.underline}.
[This is especially valuable for maintaining stability amid changes in
the global balance of power.]{.underline} Science diplomacy can lead to
dialogue between people who would otherwise be adversaries to think in
terms of common interests.

####  'gov to gov' in the context of science means the State Department facilitates government [sponsored]{.underline} researchers entering Russia -- also means the CP alone fails

John **Farrell,** 20**17** - is the Executive Director of the U.S.
Arctic Research Commission "New Agreement to Enhance International
Arctic Scientific Cooperation" October,
<https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2017/2/article/27780> //DH

[The eight member states of the Arctic Council vowed to improve
cooperation on Arctic science via a legally binding
agreement]{.underline}, entitled \"[[Agreement]{.mark}
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} Enhancing International [[Arctic Scientific
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}\" signed on 11 May 2017 at the Arctic
Council Ministerial meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska. This was the third
binding agreement initiated in the 20-year history of the Arctic
Council. The first two focused on search-and-rescue and on oil-spill
response.

In short, the goal of this science agreement is to facilitate access,
whether to territory and research areas, platforms, infrastructure,
facilities, materials, samples, data, or equipment. In the words of
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, [the document [promises to ease \"the
movement of scientists, scientific equipment and]{.mark},]{.underline}
importantly, [[data sharing\"]{.underline}]{.mark} across the North.
[Barriers to research, such as denied visas, the inability to carry
equipment and samples across national borders, or denial of access to
data, preclude scientific investigation, slow progress, increase cost,
and retard the growth of knowledge]{.underline}.

In addition to access, the agreement, which was designed to be
inclusive, contains articles that discuss education, career development
and training, traditional and local knowledge, and cooperation with
parties other than the eight Arctic nations.

[[The U.S. and Russia]{.mark} successfully [co-led the effort to reach
this agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, which required several years of
discussion and negotiation **[[under the auspices
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** an **[[Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Task Force. This cooperative effort was an uncommon bright light in a
currently dark chapter of U.S.-Russia relations. This agreement, and the
Arctic Science Ministerial meeting held at the White House on 28
September 2016, are examples of how science and research across borders
can advance diplomatic efforts through soft power, rather than coercion.
Paul Berkman and co-authors published a paper on this agreement titled,
\"The Arctic Science Agreement propels science diplomacy\" in the 3
November 2017 issue of Science.

Although signed, the agreement will not \"enter into force\" until 30
days after all eight parties have indicated that they have completed all
necessary internal procedures required to enforce the agreement. At the
time of this publication, the U.S., Sweden, Norway, and Finland have
informed Denmark, the \"depositary\" for the agreement, that they have
completed the steps necessary to implement the agreement. The final four
signatories (Russia, Canada, Iceland, and Denmark) have yet to inform
the depositary.

Each party identified geographic areas over which the agreement
pertains. These are contained in an annex to the agreement. The U.S.
Department of State has created a map that graphically displays these
areas (see Figure 1).

For the U.S., the area is the Arctic region as defined in the Arctic
Research and Policy Act of 1984 as amended, and is \"All United States
territory north of the Arctic Circle and north and west of the boundary
formed by the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; the Aleutian
chain; and adjacent marine areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort,
Bering, and Chukchi Seas.\" Maps of the U.S. Arctic may be found on the
U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC) website.

In practice, will this agreement enhance Arctic scientific cooperation?
While the intent is positive, some question whether it will do so, as
the document has several escape clauses.

For example, the agreement includes phrases such as, \"...shall use
their best efforts...,\" and \"Implementation of this Agreement shall be
subject to the availability of relevant resources.\" And Article 10
reads, \"Activities and obligations under this Agreement shall be
conducted subject to applicable international law and the applicable
laws, regulations, procedures, and policies of the Parties concerned.
For those Parties that have subnational governments, the applicable
laws, regulations, procedures, and policies include those of their
subnational governments.\"

So, it remains possible to deny access despite best efforts that fail,
or to insufficient resources to facilitate access, or to existing
procedures or policies that run counter to the goals of the agreement.

In essence, the validity of the agreement will only be determined when
it is exercised. If denials of access and other challenges can be
overcome through discussion and negotiation facilitated under this
agreement, then it will have merit. The proof will be in the pudding.

The parties to the agreement are currently in the process of
establishing specific procedures and processes necessary to implement
the agreement, and a Terms of Reference may be established.

Generally speaking, Arctic researchers have benefitted from good access
to the pan-Arctic region, but this is not always the case. For example,
entering the Russian Federation has sometimes proven difficult. Between
1990 and 2014, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[Department of]{.mark}
[State submitted 48 requests to Russia for U.S. vessels to conduct
marine scientific research in the Russian Exclusive Economic
Zone]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of those requests, 20, representing 42%, were
either denied or elicited no response, which the State Department

Conclusions

[Neither research nor solutions to global Arctic-related challenges are
possible without resuming scientific cooperation with Russia, because it
has accumulated impressive scientific experience and developed
infrastructure spread across half of the Arctic area]{.underline}. But
[due to the current fracture in Russian-Western relations, Arctic
scientific cooperation has been halted]{.underline}. The main challenge
is to find mechanisms for ways to resume cooperation with Russia in the
Arctic. One important tool is science diplomacy, which is used by both
Arctic and non-Arctic states. [The High North Talks, a diplomatic
dialogue initiated by the Geneva Centre for Security Policy]{.underline}
(GCSP), [could be a platform for resuming Arctic cooperation or to
reinitiate a possible limited exchange within the scientific
community,]{.underline} especially on environmental and climate change
issues.

In terms of international law, **[[resuming the implementation of
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** 2017 [**[Agreement on]{.mark} Enhancing
International [Arctic Scientific Cooperation]{.mark}** [seems to be a
promising way forward, because it is **not connected to political or
military antagonism**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

At the institutional level, a return to cooperation in the AC is
unlikely in the foreseeable future. However, [[the following
options]{.mark},]{.underline} which are not mutually exclusive, [[seem
possible]{.underline}:]{.mark}

• the creation by Russia of a new and inclusive organisation in the
country\'s Arctic zone;

• the development of bilateral cooperation between Russia and non-Arctic
states;

• an emphasis on global and international scientific NGOs; and

• [[support for Track 2 diplomacy]{.mark} and science diplomacy on
issues related to the environment and climate change through neutral,
independent, impartial and inclusive platforms or forums, such as
GCSP\'s High North Talks.]{.underline}

Additional options for resuming cooperation with Russia, including
through the AC working groups, are subject to the implementation of the
sanctions regime against Moscow.

On the evening of February 24, 2022, a few hours after Russia invaded
Ukraine, I was having dinner with several polar researchers, including
Dr. Antje Boetius, director of Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute, when
her phone rang. The German government was blocking scientific
collaboration with Russia as part of its deepening sanctions against the
country. The entire European Union and other governments further afield
followed closely behind. Overnight, it seemed, everything had pivoted.
All contact was severed. [Losing access to formal joint scientific
projects meant losing a tether to more than half of the
Arctic]{.underline}. Moreover, [it could mark the beginning of a
generational loss in Arctic-Russian diplomacy at a time when the region
is undergoing momentous transformations]{.underline}.

As a polar climate scientist, I was devastated. [[Currently warming
**four times faster** than the global average]{.underline}]{.mark},1
[[the Arctic has an **outsized influence on global systems**]{.mark},
including extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions,
resource-based conflicts, and vector-borne diseases]{.underline}.
[Addressing the climate crisis in the Arctic relies on positive
relationships throughout its realm, and the loss of the Russian
Federation as a partner felt insurmountable]{.underline}.

In this context, policymakers and Arctic officials---whether from the
littoral Arctic Five,2 northern Indigenous communities, or states along
the equator---need to be cognizant of their relationship with a dynamic
and multilateral northern polar region. What follows is a brief overview
of the growing sphere of climate diplomacy relating to the Arctic. This
overview is by no means exhaustive but rather briefly examines different
elements of this growing field.

THE NEXUS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND DIPLOMACY

Despite all the devastation of the Cold War, the era presented new
opportunities for international collaboration with the USSR through
non-traditional means. One such method was science diplomacy. The
pairing of science with diplomacy extends back millennia but began to be
formalized only in the interwar period. During the Cold War, the role of
science grew as an impetus for cooperation across the Iron Curtain when
traditional diplomacy was stunted.3 Interpersonal dialogue through
scientific exchanges played a pivotal role in the development of key
outcomes, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons and the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program, which
measures long-range, cross-border air pollution.

However, the longstanding alliances and fora that have ushered the
Arctic through decades of negotiations and joint efforts are no longer
adequate to withstand the new security concerns, energy demands, and
social consequences of the climate crisis in the far North. Modern
leading Arctic institutions, like the Arctic Council, explicitly do "not
deal with matters related to military security," largely seeing
militarism in the region as part of extra-regional conflict.4 However,
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which happened during Russia's Arctic
Council chairship, resulted in a fifteen-month hiatus across the
organization's activities until Norway assumed the chair in 2023.

The climate crisis is unveiling new realities of the Arctic's
environmental and geopolitical landscape. Melting sea ice is bringing
together new countries, the race for clean technology is prompting
mining by foreign corporations, while Indigenous communities are losing
land and place-based knowledge. In the process, Arctic interests flood
well beyond the High North into new territories, involve new players,
and encompass new themes. It is no longer hyperbole to claim that
**[[the fate of the Arctic affects the fate of
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, each of the United Nations'
Sustainable Development Goals, from zero hunger to gender inequality, is
dependent upon a viable North.

TIPPING POINTS: IN CLIMATE AND DIPLOMACY

[Nine of]{.underline} the [sixteen]{.underline} most commonly recognized
so-called [[climate tipping points]{.mark} are [in the polar
regions]{.mark}.]{.underline}6 [The thresholds for five of the nine are
primed to pass the +1.5 to +2.0 degrees Celsius limit]{.underline} set
by the Paris Agreement.7 [Three]{.underline} of these, including the
loss of both the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, [**[trigger
cascading effects]{.underline}** [that will be felt
globally]{.underline}]{.mark} [in terms of sea level rise, ecosystem
loss, and socioeconomic cost]{.underline}.8 According to the Global
Tipping Points program, housed at the University of Exeter's Global
Systems Institute, some changes are already set in motion as a result of
existing warming with three tipping points set to be reached during the
2030s.9 In the first two decades of the twenty-first century, damage
caused by extreme weather events has had an average price tag of USD 143
billion per year.10 The wide-reaching impacts associated with such
tipping points are also literally and figuratively opening new playing
grounds and threatening the traditional tenets of polar diplomacy.11

According to Duan et al., the [[loss of]{.underline}]{.mark} snow and
[[ice in the Arctic could worsen global warming by]{.underline}]{.mark}
as much as **[[40 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**.12 Christian Aid, a
United Kingdom charity, identifies ten natural disasters in 2022 that
each exceeded costs of USD 3 billion,13 a doubling from the year before
when USD 1.5 billion was the baseline for the ten costliest natural
disasters.14 T he most expensive in 2022 was Hurricane Ian with
approximately USD 112 billion in damages across Cuba and the United
States.15 Additionally, more than 36 million people were affected by the
continued drought in the Horn of Africa, and a further 30 million were
displaced by flooding in Pakistan.16 Although it is not yet possible to
attribute a degree with perfect certainty, each of these catastrophes
has the fingerprints of Arctic change, through the intensification of
Atlantic cyclones,17 or the rising of temperatures,18 and changing of
precipitation patterns.19

One thing is vitally clear: [as the world sets positive feedback loops
in motion, there can be no further petroleum development in the
Arctic]{.underline} and there needs to be a complete phase-out of all
fossil fuels. Much of the international interest in the northern polar
region has stemmed from the global addiction to fossil fuels. [This
region holds 30 percent of]{.underline} the world's [natural gas and 13
percent of]{.underline} its untapped [oil]{.underline},20 comprising
trillions of U.S. dollars. However, a recent report by the International
Energy Agency doubles down on the need for [these]{.underline} to
[remain untapped if the world is to keep warming below +1.5 degrees
Celsius]{.underline}.21

Beyond the need to keep temperatures below +1.5 degrees Celsius, fossil
fuel extraction reinforces Western colonialism, which has imperiled the
area since the sixteenth century.22 For roughly four hundred thousand
Indigenous people in the Arctic, petroleum, and mining industries have
yielded a loss in land, identity, health, and biodiversity.23
Additionally, with the United States, Russia, and China leading this
modern gold rush, the climate is under even greater threat due to the
Great Powers' simmering diplomatic tensions and sanctions.

Looking beyond the petroleum industry in the Arctic, the region holds
another dangerous source of temperature-rising emissions: thawing
permafrost. [[**Even with moderations in warming**,]{.mark} permafrost
is quickly becoming an emitter on par with a large industrialized
country.]{.underline} [If emission growth is unchecked, [permafrost
**alone** could consume]{.mark} as much as [40 percent of the]{.mark}
remaining [carbon budget]{.mark} to stay under +2°C.]{.underline}24
Thawing permafrost is poised to release radioactive particles,
microplastics that are often ingested by creatures (including humans),
and soot which enhances local warming and melting by absorbing solar
radiation. However, [[due to historical gaps in data, the impact of
permafrost on global emissions remains excluded from global
stocktakes]{.mark}.]{.underline}25 [This means that the [projections and
modeling]{.mark} of the local and global impacts as well as the
timescales of a warming world are [grossly
underreported]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT: Capture advantage CP

#### Permafrost thaw will rapidly accelerate warming and will outstrip efforts at carbon storage

[The Arctic has been warming]{.underline} three to [four times faster
than the global average for several decades]{.underline}.2 [With this
rapid warming, Arctic regions are experiencing a wide range of impacts
at multiple scales, entailing not only damages to ecosystems and human
wellbeing]{.underline} within the region---such as the local impacts
from permafrost thaw and sea-ice retreat, altered abundance of
economically and culturally important species, and wildfires increasing
in coverage and intensity---[but also far-reaching disruptions,
including impacts of the altered North-South temperature gradient and
Arctic Ocean freshening on Northern Hemisphere climate
patterns]{.underline}, the contributions to global sea-level rise from
shrinkage of Arctic glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet, [and toxic
smoke from Arctic wildfires propagating into the
mid-latitudes.]{.underline}

As the Arctic region changes, moreover, [ecosystems that have
historically served as carbon sinks, such as wetlands and forests, **may
emerge as sources of carbon emissions.**]{.underline}3 Indeed, it is
quite possible that [the most important global impact of rapid Arctic
warming o]{.underline}ver the next few decades [will come from the
emissions of]{.underline} the globally mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs),
[carbon dioxide]{.underline} (CO2) [and methane]{.underline} (CH4),
[from thawing permafrost]{.underline}.4 [The amount of carbon in Arctic
soils is about twice the amount currently in the
atmosphere]{.underline},5 [and most of that carbon is in organic matter
frozen in permafrost]{.underline}.

Additional carbon is present in subsea permafrost, which was formerly a
terrestrial permafrost environment when sea levels were lower during the
last glacial maximum.6,7 Together, terrestrial and subsea permafrost
contain an order of magnitude more organic carbon than contained in
plant biomass (including woody debris and plant litter) in the same
region8, which suggests that [carbon release from permafrost has the
potential to significantly outweigh regional plants' potential for
increased carbon storage]{.underline}.9

Emissions of carbon from permafrost result primarily from the activity
of microbial communities, the organisms that produce CO2 and CH4 as part
of their natural metabolism.10 The aerobic decomposition of permafrost
by microbial activity in an oxygen-rich environment produces CO2, while
anaerobic decomposition in an oxygen-poor (typically wetter) environment
releases CH4. As permafrost soils thaw, the existing cold-adapted
microbial community (containing bacteria, archaea, viruses, and
micro-eukaryotes such as fungi) is strongly affected by warmer
temperatures, higher soil water content from melted ground ice, and
increased nutrient availability from deeper rooting vegetation.11,12
These environmental changes alter the ecological conditions of the soil
microbiome, increasing metabolic rates and thereby accelerating the
decomposition of diverse organic carbon compounds into CO2 and CH4.13

Ecological and geomorphological processes are highly sensitive to the
phase change between ice and water and are currently poorly
understood.15 Phase change sensitivity makes the structure and function
of permafrost ecosystems unique and uniquely vulnerable to the changes
arising from a warming climate. As research leads to improved knowledge
of the identities and proportions of the relevant microorganisms in the
ecosystem and how that relates to regional-scale emission rates, the
projections (by carbon-cycle models) of future emissions in this
critically important context will likewise improve.16

The effect that changes in Arctic permafrost soils will ultimately have
on the global climate depends on several factors. These include not only
the speed of permafrost thaw (itself a complex function of the pace of
warming in interaction with multiple mechanisms by which permafrost is
exposed to it), but also other processes: the other environmental
factors that affect the speed of microbial action; how much of the
mobilized carbon is released to the atmosphere as trace gases as opposed
to stored as dissolved aquatic carbon; the proportion of the release
that is CH4 versus CO2; and how much of this release is offset by
increased plant biomass and new inputs to the soil carbon pool in a
"greening Arctic."17

As result of this complexity and variations in how different studies
have approached predictions in the face of inadequacies in both models
and data, the scientific literature contains a wide range of estimates
of the magnitude of emissions to be expected as a function of time for
given trajectories of global and Arctic warming. Perhaps the most
rigorous and comprehensive recent effort to sort through the estimates
and arguments18 found that:

On a low-warming global trajectory (low emissions scenario RCP 2.6 in
the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report):

• emissions from terrestrial permafrost over the current century in a
representative scenario reached 37 billion tons of carbon in CO2 and 1.1
billion tons of carbon in CH4.

• Converting the carbon in CH4 to its equivalent in carbon in CO2 using
the "sustainable global warming potential" multiplier of 16.45
recommended by Schuur et al. (2022)ix shows this CH4 release to be
equivalent to 18 billion tons of carbon in CO2, giving 55 billion tons
of carbon in CO2-equivalent as the combined total for the two gases.

• A median estimate of society's carbon budget for a two-thirds chance
of holding the global-average surface temperature increase to 2⁰C is 315
billion tons of C in CO2 after 2020.19 The indicated permafrost
emissions would eat up 17.5% of this figure.20,21

On a high-warming global trajectory (high emissions scenario RCP 8.5 in
the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report):

• global-average surface temperature would careen past the 2⁰C target
and arrive at 3.5-4⁰C above pre-industrial in 2100 (with Arctic-average
surface temperature likely reaching 10-15⁰C).

• On this trajectory, CO2 and CH4 emissions from gradually top-down
thawing permafrost could release 5-15% of the permafrost carbon pool in
the next decades and centuries,22 but abrupt thaw (e.g., rapid thawing
resulting in relatively sudden ground collapse) would degrade permafrost
significantly faster than gradual top-down warming alone. About 20% of
the northern permafrost region, containing at least 50% of the shallow
permafrost carbon pool23, has high ground ice content and is susceptible
to abrupt thaw with warming. A higher fraction of CH4 is emitted during
abrupt thaw events compared to gradual thaw.24

• The scenarios developed in Schurr et al. for this high-emissions
trajectory entail cumulative emissions over the current century of
75-150 billion tons of C in CO2 and 2.5-5 billion tons of C in CH4, the
latter equivalent, with the Schurr et al. multiplier of 16.45, to
another 40-80 billion tons of C in CO2. The higher total of 230 billion
tons of C in CO2-equivalent is about 15% of the 21st century emissions
of C in CO2 under the IPCC's SSP3-7.0 trajectory.

Notwithstanding the evident potential importance of emissions from
permafrost to the global climate future, [the influence of permafrost
thaw is largely absent from global earth system models]{.underline}.
[When included at all, only linear (gradual, top-down) thaw has been
represented. Rapid thaw caused by thermokarst, hill slope collapse,
wildfires, and other nonlinear phenomena, which are occurring with
increasing frequency, are not modeled.]{.underline} [This
under-representation of potential permafrost-thaw contributions in the
models being used to inform deliberations about national and global
climate policies **compromises the ability to effectively achieve
goals.**]{.underline}

Engaging Arctic Indigenous Communities

In recent years, [there has been increasing effort to integrate
Indigenous knowledge and Western science approaches to understand rapid
environmental changes across Arctic lands and waters]{.underline}. Given
the complexity of climate impacts in the North, this knowledge
integration is critical for better understanding and for guiding
responses to rapid climate changes. Northern communities have been
dealing with multiple climate hazards associated with permafrost thaw,
flooding, erosion, loss of sea ice, and changing availability of food
sources for decades. To fail to incorporate this largely Indigenous
knowledge into the ongoing efforts of Western science to understand
these processes would be a terrible oversight.

The Permafrost Pathways initiative includes partnerships between
Indigenous knowledge holders and Western scientists to guide
environmental monitoring, including of CH4 fluxes. These partnerships
can contribute substantially to adaptation decision making in response
to permafrost thaw and other climate changes in the Arctic. Emerging
initiatives, such as PermafrostNet, convene researchers, Indigenous
communities, scholars, and government agencies to expand research to
importantly address the "so what" of permafrost thaw, its impacts on
communities, and contribute to adaptation efforts.67 [Indigenous
community engagement is also a fundamental component of permafrost
research collaborative networks, including the]{.underline} Canadian
NSERC Permafrost Partnership Network, the [Permafrost Community Practice
of the US Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, and the
Sustainable Development Working Group of the Arctic
Council]{.underline}.
